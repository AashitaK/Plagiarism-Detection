    "# Plagiarism Detection\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used here is a small sample taken from the [International Competition on Plagiarism Detection PAN 2010](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/media/chairs/computer-science-department/webis/data/corpus-pan-pc-10/). It consists of two kinds of files - suspicious documents and source documents. The dataset also contains information about whether a suspicious documents is plagiarized or not from the source documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model overview\n",
    "We have built a classifier below to classify the suspicious documents as plagiarized or not. This is done in broadly two steps:\n",
    "1. First we derive four distinct similarity measures for each suspicious document. Two of the measures - Jaccard similarity coefficient and containment measure - are derived from the overlapping of the **trigrams** of the text, the next measure longest common sequence is derived from the tokens of the text whereas the last one is derived from the closeness of the vectors in Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). \n",
    "2. Next we use these measures as the features for the suspicious documents to train a logistic regression classifier on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "Plagiarism comes in many forms. The first two of the similarity measures coming from the trigrams is targeted to catch the copying of the text from the source documents whereas the similarity measure related to LSA attempts to catch the restructuring, revising and paraphrasing of the original text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is designed after reviewing the literature and playing with various ideas such as in terms of text preprocessing. Many ideas, such as the first three similarity measures derived from trigrams, are borrowed from the paper [Using Natural Language Processing for Automatic Detection of Plagiarism](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.9440&rep=rep1&type=pdf)  by Miranda Chong, et. al. For the text pre-processing, the detailed analysis from the paper  [The Influence of Text Pre-processing on Plagiarism Detection](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a47c/1a35e2858da1eb82077b572e538a7b0b7b2d.pdf) is taken into account while building the model. The figure 2 in the paper clearly depicts the impact of the most commonly used text preprocessing methods. The following decisions are made for text preprocessing:\n",
    "1. Stopwords and punctutations are not removed for the first two measures since they seem to play a role in detecting overlapping in the trigrams, whereas both are removed for the last two measures.\n",
    "2. Sentence segmentation is avoided since the plagiarism seem to span across consecutive sentences, hence the trigrams linking the sentences are useful as well.\n",
    "3. Numbers are removed at the very beginning and so are colons and plus signs.\n",
    "4. Lowercase is used throughout the text.\n",
    "5. Lemmatization is used but only for deriving the last feature (or measure) using LSA.\n",
    "6. POS-tagging might prove to be useful but the current model does not use it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools used: re (regular expressions), numpy, pandas, nltk, sklearn\n",
    "'\n",
    "### Ideas/Future work\n",
    "* Text preprocessing: POS-tagging, synonymy recognition, etc.\n",
    "* Using bigrams, 4-grams and/or 5-grams along with (or instead of) trigrams\n",
    "* Deriving more features for the classifier using more similarity measures or other approaches\n",
    "* Tuning the parameters for the logistic regression classifier\n",
    "* Modifying/optimizing the code for large-scale data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "* Multi-source plagiarism:  When each suspicious documents is compared with all source documents to calculate the similarity meaures, the highest scores are considered. Thus, multi-source plagiarism  is not taken into account. This can be fixed by instead considering the average of the top 3 scores while calculating the similarity measures.\n",
    "* Language translation: Our model does not cover the plagiarism caused by translating the original text in another language\n",
    "* Paraphrasing is only partially addressed.\n",
    "* Model so far has a serious flaw that it might also flag a document that has properly quoted from the original source along with giving correct reference. This can be fixed by looking for the quotations at the very beginning. Check that the source for each quotation is properly attributed and then removing the quote along with the reference text.  \n",
    "* Model is built as a classifier that needs labeled data to train it."
