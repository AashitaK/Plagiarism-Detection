PREFACE

I suspect that in this volume my reader will feel that I have given him a stone when he asked
for bread, and his feeling in this respect will need no apology. I fear there is more of the
matter of hard science and of scientific speculation in this collection than of spiritual and
aesthetic nutriment; but I do hope the volume is not entirely destitute of the latter. If I
have not in some degree succeeded in transmuting my rocks into a kind of wholesome literary
bread, or, to vary the figure, in turning them into a soil in which some green thing or flower
of human interest and emotion may take root and grow, then, indeed, have I come short of the
end I had in view.

I am well aware that my own interest in geology far outruns my knowledge, but if I can in some
degree kindle that interest in my reader, I shall be putting him on the road to a fuller knowledge
than I possess. As with other phases of nature, I have probably loved the rocks more than I
have studied them. In my youth I delighted in lingering about and beneath the ledges of my
native hills, partly in the spirit of adventure and a boy's love of the wild, and partly with
an eye to their curious forms, and the evidences of immense time that looked out from their
gray and crumbling fronts. I was in the presence of Geologic Time, and was impressed by the
scarred and lichen-coated veteran without knowing who or what he was. But he put a spell upon
me that has deepened as the years have passed, and now my boyhood ledges are more interesting
to me than ever.

If one gains an interest in the history of the earth, he is quite sure to gain an interest
in the history of the life on the earth. If the former illustrates the theory of development,
so must the latter. The geologist is pretty sure to be an evolutionist. As science turns over
the leaves of the great rocky volume, it sees the imprint of animals and plants upon them and
it traces their changes and the appearance of new species from age to age. The biologic tree
has grown and developed as the geologic soil in which it is rooted has deepened and ripened.
I am sure I was an evolutionist in the abstract, or by the quality and complexion of my mind,
before I read Darwin, but to become an evolutionist in the concrete, and accept the doctrine
of the animal origin of man, has not for me been an easy matter.

The essays on the subject in this volume are the outcome of the stages of brooding and thinking
which I have gone through in accepting this doctrine. I am aware that there is much repetition
in them, but maybe on that very account they will help my reader to go along with me over the
long road we have to travel to reach this conclusion.

THE LONG ROAD

I

The long road I have in mind is the long road of evolution,--the road you and I have traveled
in the guise of humbler organisms, from the first unicellular life in the old Cambrian seas
to the complex and highly specialized creature that rules supreme in the animal kingdom to-day.
Surely a long journey, stretching through immeasurable epochs of geologic time, and attended
by vicissitudes of which we can form but feeble conceptions.

The majority of readers, I fancy, are not yet ready to admit that they, or any of their forebears,
have ever made such a journey. We have all long been taught that our race was started upon
its career only a few thousand years ago, started, not amid the warrings of savage elemental
nature, but in a pleasant garden with everything needed close at hand. This belief has faded
a good deal in our time, especially among thoughtful persons; but in a modified form, as the
special creation theory, it held sway in the minds of the older naturalists like Agassiz and
Dawson, long after Darwin had launched his revolutionary doctrine of our animal origin, putting
man in the same zoological scheme as the lower orders.

We are slow to adjust our minds to the revelations of science, they have been so long adjusted
to a revelation, so-called, of an entirely different character. It gives them a wrench more
or less violent when we try to make them at home and at their ease amid these new and startling
disclosures. To many good people evolution seems an ungodly doctrine, like setting up a remorseless
logic in the place of an omnipresent Creator. But there is no help for it. Science has fairly
turned us out of our comfortable little anthropomorphic notion of things into the great out-of-doors
of the universe. We must and will get used to the chill, yea, to the cosmic chill, if need
be. Our religious instincts will be all the hardier for it.

When we accepted Newton's discovery of the force called gravitation, we virtually surrendered
ourselves to the enemy, and started upon a road, the road of natural causation, that traverses
the whole system of created things. We cannot turn back; we may lie down by the roadside and
dream our old dreams, but our children and their children will press on, and will be exhilarated
by the journey.

It is at first sight an unpalatable truth that evolution confronts us with, and it requires
courage calmly to face it. But it is in perfect keeping with the whole career of physical science,
which is forever directing our attention to common near-at-hand facts for the key to remote
and mysterious occurrences.

It seems to me that evolution adds greatly to the wonder of life, because it takes it out of
the realm of the arbitrary, the exceptional, and links it to the sequence of natural causation.
That man should have been brought into existence by the fiat of an omnipotent power is less
an occasion for wonder than that he should have worked his way up from the lower non-human
forms. That the manward impulse should never have been lost in all the appalling vicissitudes
of geologic time, that it should have pushed steadily on, through mollusk and fish and amphibian
and reptile, through swimming and creeping and climbing things, and that the forms that conveyed
it should have escaped the devouring monsters of the earth, sea, and air till it came to its
full estate in a human being, is the wonder of wonders.

In like manner, evolution raises immensely the value of the biological processes that are everywhere
operative about us, by showing us that these processes are the channels through which the creative
energy has worked, and is still working. Not in the far-off or in the exceptional does it seek
the key to man's origin, but in the sleepless activity of the creative force, which has been
pushing onward and upward, from the remotest time, till it has come to full fruition in man.

It is easy to inject into man's natural history a supernatural element, as nearly all biologists
and anthropologists before Darwin's time did, and as many serious people still do. It is too
easy, in fact, and the temptation to do so is great. It makes short work of the problem of
man's origin, and saves a deal of trouble. But this method is more and more discredited, and
the younger biologists and natural philosophers accept the zoological conception of man, which
links him with all the lower forms, and proceed to work from that.

When we have taken the first step in trying to solve the problem of man's origin, where can
we stop? Can we find any point in his history where we can say, Here his natural history ends,
and his supernatural history begins? Does his natural history end with the pre-glacial man,
with the cave man, or the river-drift man, with the low-browed, long-jawed fossil man of Java,--Pithecanthropus
erectus, described by Du Bois? Where shall we stop on his trail? I had almost said "step on
his tail," for we undoubtedly, if we go back far enough, come to a time when man had a tail.
Every unborn child at a certain stage of its development still has a tail, as it also has a
coat of hair and a hand-like foot. But could we stop with the tailed man--the manlike ape,
or the apelike man? Did his Creator start him with this appendage, or was it a later suffix
of his own invention?

If we once seriously undertake to solve the riddle of man's origin, and go back along the line
of his descent, I doubt if we can find the point, or the form, where the natural is supplanted
by the supernatural as it is called, where causation ends and miracle begins. Even the first
dawn of protozoic life in the primordial seas must have been natural, or it would not have
occurred,--must have been potential in what went before it. In this universe, so far as we
know it, one thing springs from another; the sequence of cause and effect is continuous and
inviolable.

We know that no man is born of full stature, with his hat and boots on; we know that he grows
from an infant, and we know the infant grows from a fetus, and that the fetus grows from a
bit of nucleated protoplasm in the mother's womb. Why may not the race of man grow from a like
simple beginning? It seems to be the order of nature; it IS the order of nature,--first the
germ, the inception, then the slow growth from the simple to the complex. It is the order of
our own thoughts, our own arts, our own civilization, our own language.

In our candid moments we acknowledge the animal in ourselves and in our neighbors,--especially
in our neighbors,--the beast, the shark, the hog, the sloth, the fox, the monkey; but to accept
the notion of our animal origin, that gives us pause. To believe that our remote ancestor,
no matter how remote in time or space, was a lowly organized creature living in the primordial
seas with no more brains than a shovel-nosed shark or a gar-pike, puts our scientific faith
to severe test.

Think of it. For countless ages, millions upon millions of years, we see the earth swarming
with life, low bestial life, devouring and devoured, myriads of forms, all in bondage to nature
or natural forces, living only to eat and to breed, localized, dependent upon place and clime,
shaped to specific ends like machines,--to fly, to swim, to climb, to run, to dig, to drill,
to weave, to wade, to graze, to crush,--knowing not what they do, as void of conscious purpose
as the thorns, the stings, the hooks, the coils, and the wings in the vegetable world, making
no impression upon the face of nature, as much a part of it as the trees and the stones, species
after species having its day, and then passing off the stage, when suddenly, in the day before
yesterday in the geologic year, so suddenly as to give some color of truth to the special creation
theory, a new and strange animal appears, with new and strange powers, separated from the others
by what appears an impassable gulf, less specialized in his bodily powers than the others,
but vastly more specialized in his brain and mental powers, instituting a new order of things
upon the earth, the face of which he in time changes through his new gift of reason, inventing
tools and weapons and language, harnessing the physical forces to his own ends, and putting
all things under his feet,--man the wonder-worker, the beholder of the stars, the critic and
spectator of creation itself, the thinker of the thoughts of God, the worshiper, the devotee,
the hero, spreading rapidly over the earth, and developing with prodigious strides when once
fairly launched upon his career. Can it be possible, we ask, that this god was fathered by
the low bestial orders below him,--instinct giving birth to reason, animal ferocity developing
into human benevolence, the slums of nature sending forth the ruler of the earth. It is a hard
proposition, I say, undoubtedly the hardest that science has ever confronted us with.

Haeckel, discussing this subject, suggests that it is the parvenu in us that is reluctant to
own our lowly progenitors, the pride of family and position, like that of would-be aristocratic
sons who conceal the humble origin of their parents. But it is more than that; it is the old
difficulty of walking by faith where there is nothing visible to walk upon: we lack faith in
the efficiency of the biologic laws, or any mundane forces, to bridge the tremendous chasm
that separates man from even the highest of the lower orders. His radical unlikeness to all
the forms below him, as if he moved in a world apart, into which they could never enter, as
in a sense he does, is where the difficulty lies. Moreover, evolution balks us because of the
inconceivable stretch of time during which it has been at work. It is as impossible for us
to grasp geological time as sidereal space. All the standards of measurement furnished us by
experience are as inadequate as is a child's cup to measure the ocean.

Several million years, or one million years,--how can we take it in? We cannot. A hundred years
is a long time in human history, and how we pause before a thousand! Then think of ten thousand,
of fifty thousand, of one hundred thousand, of ten hundred thousand, or one million, or of
one hundred million! What might not the slow but ceaseless creative energy do in that time,
changing but a hair in each generation! If our millionaires had to earn their wealth cent by
cent, and carry each cent home with them at night, it would be some years before they became
millionaires. This is but a faint symbol of the slow process by which nature has piled up her
riches. She has had no visions of sudden wealth. To clothe the earth with soil made from the
disintegrated mountains--can we figure that time to ourselves? The Orientals try to get a hint
of eternity by saying that when the Himalayas have been ground to powder by allowing a gauze
veil to float against them once in a thousand years, eternity will only have just begun. Our
mountains have been pulverized by a process almost as slow. In our case the gauze veil is the
air, and the rains, and the snows, before which even granite crumbles. See what the god of
erosion, in the shape of water, has done in the river valleys and gorges--cut a mile deep in
the Colorado canyon, and yet this canyon is but of yesterday in geologic time. Only give the
evolutionary god time enough and all these miracles are surely wrought.

Truly it is hard for us to realize what a part time has played in the earth's history,--just
time, duration,--so slowly, oh, so slowly, have the great changes been brought about! The turning
of mud and silt into rock in the bottom of the old seas seems to have been merely a question
of time. Mud does not become rock in man's time, nor vegetable matter become coal. These processes
are too slow for us. The flexing and folding of the rocky strata, miles deep, under an even
pressure, is only a question of time. Allow time enough and force enough, and a layer of granite
may be bent like a bow. The crystals of the rock seem to adjust themselves to the strain, and
to take up new positions, just as they do, much more rapidly, in a cake of ice under pressure.
Probably no human agency could flex a stratum of rock, because there is not time enough, even
if there were power enough. "A low temperature acting gradually," says my geology, "during
an indefinite age would produce results that could not be otherwise brought about even through
greater heat." "Give us time," say the great mechanical forces, "and we will show you the immobile
rocks and your rigid mountain chains as flexible as a piece of leather." "Give us time," say
the dews and the rains and the snowflakes, "and we will make you a garden out of those same
stubborn rocks and frowning ledges." "Give us time," says Life, starting with her protozoans
in the old Cambrian seas, "and I will not stop till I have peopled the earth with myriad forms
and crowned them all with man."

Dana thinks that had "a man been living during the changes that produced the coal, he would
not have suspected their progress," so slow and quiet were they. It is probable that parts
of our own sea-coast are sinking and other parts rising as rapidly as the oscillation of the
land and sea went on that resulted in the laying down of the coal measures.

An eternity to man is but a day in the cosmic process. In the face of geologic time, man's
appearance upon the earth as man, with a written history, is something that has just happened;
it was in this morning's paper, we read of it at breakfast. As evolution goes, it will not
be old news yet for a hundred thousand years or so, and by that time, what will he have done,
if he goes on at his present rate of accelerated speed? Probably he will not have caught the
gods of evolution at their work, or witnessed the origin of species by natural descent, these
things are too slow for him; but he will certainly have found out many things that we are all
eager to know.

In nature as a whole we see results and not processes. We see the rock strata bent and folded,
we see the whole mountain-chains flexed and shortened by the flexure; but had we been present,
we should not have suspected what was going on. Our little span of life does not give us the
parallax necessary. The rock strata, miles thick, may be being flexed now under our feet, and
we know it not. The earth is shrinking, but so slowly! When, under the slow strain, the strata
suddenly give way or sink, and an earthquake results, then we know something has happened.

A recent biologist and physicist thinks, and doubtless thinks wisely, that the reason why we
have never been able to produce living from non-living matter in our laboratories, is that
we cannot take time enough. Even if we could bring about the conditions of the early geologic
ages in which life had its dawn, which of course we cannot, we could not produce life because
we have not geologic time at our disposal.

The reaction which we call life was probably as much a cosmic or geologic event as were the
reactions which produced the different elements and compounds, and demanded the same slow gestation
in the womb of time. During what cycles upon cycles the great mother-forces of the universe
must have brooded over the inorganic before the organic was brought forth! The archean age,
during which the brooding seems to have gone on, was probably as long as all the ages since.

How we are baffled when we talk about the beginning of anything in nature or in our own lives!
In our experience there must be a first, but when did manhood begin; when did puberty, when
did old age, begin? When did each stage of our mental growth begin? When or where did the English
language begin, or the French, or the German? Was there a first English word spoken? From the
first animal sound, if we can conceive of such, up to the human speech of to-day, there is
an infinite gradation of sounds and words.

Was there a first summer, a first winter, a first spring? There could hardly have been a first
day even for ages and ages, but only slowly approximating day. After an immense lapse of time
the air must have cleared and the day become separated from the night, and the seasons must
have become gradually defined. Things slowly emerge one after another from a dim, nebulous
condition, both in our own growth and experience and in the development of the physical universe.

In nature there is no first and last. There is an endless beginning and an endless ending.
There was no first man or first woman, no first bird, or fish, or reptile. Back of each one
stretches an endless chain of approximating men and birds and reptiles.

This talk about the time and place where man began his existence seems to me misleading, because
it appears to convey the idea that he began as man at some time, in some place. Whereas he
grew. He began where and when the first cell appeared, and he has been on the road ever since.
There is no point in the line where he emerged from the not-man and became man. He was emerging
from the not-man for millions of years, and when you put your finger on an animal form and
say, This is man, you must go back through whole geologic periods before you reach the not-man.
If Darwin is right, there is no more reason for believing that the different species or forms
of animal life were suddenly introduced than there is for believing that the soil, or the minerals,
gold, silver, diamonds, or vegetable mold and verdure were suddenly introduced.

II

If we know anything of the earth's past history, we know that the continents were long in forming,
that they passed through many vicissitudes of heat and cold, of fire and flood, of upheaval
and subsidence--that they had, so to speak, their first low, simple rudimentary or invertebrate
life, that they were all slow in getting their backbones, slower still in clothing their rock
ribs with soil and verdure, that they passed through a sort of amphibian stage, now under water,
now on dry land, that their many kinds of soils and climes were not differentiated and their
complex water-systems established till well into Tertiary times--in short, that they have passed
more and more from the simple to the complex, from the disorganized to the organized. When
man comes to draw his sustenance from their breasts, may they not be said to have reached the
mammalian stage?

The fertile plain and valley and the rounded hill are of slow growth, immensely slow. But any
given stage of the earth has followed naturally from the previous stage, only more and more
and higher and higher forces took a hand in the game. First its elements passed through the
stage of fire, then through the stage of water, then merged into the stage of air. More and
more the aerial elements--oxygen, carbon, nitrogen--have entered into its constituents and
fattened the soil. The humanizing of the earth has been largely a process of oxidation. More
than disintegrated rock makes up the soil; the air and the rains and the snows have all contributed
a share.

The history of the soil which we turn with our spade, and stamp with our shoes, covers millions
upon millions of years. It is the ashes of the mountains, the leavings of untold generations
of animal and vegetable life. It came out of the sea, it drifted from the heavens; it flowed
out from the fiery heart of the globe; it has been worked over and over by frost and flood,
blown by winds, shoveled by ice, --mixed and kneaded and moulded as the house-wife kneads and
moulds her bread,--refining and refining from age to age. Much of it was held in solution in
the primordial seas, whence it was filtered and used and precipitated by countless forms of
marine life, making a sediment that in time became rocks, that again in time became continents
or parts of them, which the aerial forces reduced to soil. Indeed, the soil itself is an evolution,
as much so as the life upon it.

We probably have little conception of how intimate and cooperative all parts of the universe
are with one another,--of the debt we owe to the farthest stars, and to the remotest period
of time. We must owe a debt to the monsters of Mesozoic and Caenozoic time; they helped to
fertilize the soil for us, and to discipline the ruder forces of life. We owe a debt to all
that has gone before: to the heavens above and to the earth-fires beneath, to the ice-sheets
that ground down the mountains, and to the ocean currents. Just as we owe a debt to the men
and women in our line of descent, so we owe a debt to the ruder primordial forces that shaped
the planet to our use, and took a hand in the game of animal life.

The gods of evolution had served a long apprenticeship; they had gained proficiency and were
master workmen. Or shall we say that the elements of life had become more plastic and adaptable,
or that the life fund had accumulated, so to speak? Had the vast succession of living beings,
the long experience in organization, at last made the problem of the origin of man easier to solve?

One fancies every living thing as not only returning its mineral elements to the soil, but
as in some subtle way leaving its vital forces also, and thus contributing to the impalpable,
invisible store-house of vital energy of the globe.

At first among the mammalian tribes there was much muscle and little brains. But in the middle
Tertiary the mammal brain began suddenly to enlarge, so that in our time the brain of the horse
is more than eight times the size of the brain of his progenitor, the dinoceras of Eocene times.

Nature seems to have experimented with brains and nerve ganglia, as she has with so many other
things. The huge reptilian creatures of Mesozoic time--the various dinosaurs--had ridiculously
small heads and brains, but they had what might be called supplementary brains well toward
the other end of the body,--great nervous masses near the sacrum, many times the size of the
ostensible brain, which no doubt performed certain brain functions. But the principle of centralization
was at work, and when in later time we reach the higher mammalian forms, we find these outlying
nervous masses called in, so to speak, and concentrated in the head.

Nature has tried the big, the gigantic, over and over, and then abandoned it. In Carboniferous
times there was a gigantic dragon-fly, measuring more than two feet in the expanse of wings.
Still earlier, there were gigantic mollusks and sea scorpions, a cephalopod larger than a man;
then gigantic fishes and amphibians and reptiles, followed by enormous mammals. But the geologic
record shows that these huge forms did not continue. The mollusks that last unchanged through
millions of years are the clam and the oyster of our day. The huge mosses and tree-ferns are
gone, and only their humbler types remain. Among men giants are short-lived.

On the other hand, the steady increase in size of certain other species of animals during the
later geologic ages is a curious and interesting fact. The first progenitors of the elephant
that have been found show a small animal that steadily grew through the ages till the animal
as we now find it is reached. Among the invertebrates this same progressive increase in size
has been noted, a small shell in the Devonian becoming enormous in the Triassic. Certain species
of sharks of medium size in the lower Eocene continue to increase till they attain the astounding
dimensions in the Miocene and Pliocene of over one hundred feet long. A certain fish appearing
in the Devonian as a small fish of seven centimetres in length, becomes in the Carboniferous
era a creature twenty-seven centimetres in length. Among the mammals of Tertiary times this
same law of steady increase in size has been operative, as seen in the Felidae, the stag, and
the antelope. Man himself has, no doubt, been under the same law, and is probably a much larger
animal than any of his Tertiary ancestors. In the vegetable world this process, in many cases,
at least, has been reversed, and the huge treelike club-mosses and horsetails of Carboniferous
times have dwindled in our time to very insignificant herbaceous forms.

Animals of overweening size are handicapped in many ways, so that nature in most cases finally
abandons the gigantic and sticks to the medium and the small.

III

Can we fail to see the significance of the order in which life has appeared upon the globe--the
ascending series from the simple to the more and more complex? Can we doubt that each series
is the outcome of the one below it--that there is a logical sequence from the protozoa up through
the invertebrates, the vertebrates, to man? Is it not like all that we know of the method of
nature? Could we substitute the life of one period for that of another without doing obvious
violence to the logic of nature? Is there no fundamental reason for the gradation we behold?

All animal life lowest in organization is earliest in time, and vice versa, the different classes
of a sub-kingdom, and the different orders of a class, succeeding one another, as Cope says,
in the relative order of their zoological rank. I was then fifteen. That is how I became a choir
singer when ten years of age. Mr. Aiken used to pick me out from among the children of the public
schools and place me in the front row in every school I ever attended while he taught the music.

Mr.
Aiken became musical instructor in the schools in 1848. It was then I was selected to join
the choral class. There were fifty boys and girls picked from the
different schools and we had a fine drilling each Saturday afternoon
in the basement of the church.

One of the boys had a high soprano voice and we all admired his singing to adoration. He was
as courteous as his voice was beautiful--unspoiled by praise. We had one chorus we all loved,
of which he was the soloist, and we were not satisfied with the rehearsal
until we had sung, and the young master had so beautifully rendered
the obbligato to the song, "Shepherd, from your sleep awake, Morning
opes her golden eyes, etc."

How well I remember the words of the song and the beautiful boy singer that left the impression
of his voice in my life, and I can see the picture as plain as if it hung on the wall of my studio today.
From that voice and the correct guidance of my sainted sister Mary
I have been able to sing and please the many thousands of people who
have listened to me in my years of song wherever I strayed--in the
East or West.

In speaking of Professor Junkerman's work in the schools of Cincinnati, a coincidence happened
in 1906 which recalled my childhood days with all the vivid coloring traced upon my mind fifty-two years
ago. In the number of The Musician for May, 1906, I saw two pictures that were familiar and I looked
without seeing the names printed beneath them.

To my utter astonishment they were the likenesses of Mr. Aiken and Professor Junkerman, whom
I had not seen for over fifty years and yet I knew them at sight--the moment my eyes beheld
them. In reading the article and what it contained in regard to the music and its development,
I was able to go over the whole ground of Mr. Aiken's teaching as if I were once more a school child.
All three of these persons were in the schools--Professor Junkerman, in languages, organ and
piano; my sister, Mary Kroh, his pupil on both organ and piano, also teacher of English and German,
and Mr. Aiken, the teacher in the public schools for voice and the
movable "do" system.

Was ever such a windfall of good fortune as this proved to me? I had tried to recall the name
of the dear old professor to use it in my narrative, but my memory was at fault. We all loved
him so well. He was a thorough musician and thoroughly appreciated by all who had the advantage
of his knowledge, either in languages or in instrumental music. The Musician contains a complete
detail of these two men who were instrumental in promoting the best music in the early years
of 1839 and later in 1842 and continued until 1879 for Mr. Aiken, and Professor Junkerman closed
his public career in 1900. We had so long hoped against hope that the sight of the familiar
writing caused the greatest excitement. Poor mother could hardly hold out any longer and the
news was too much for her weak body, for she was just convalescing from weeks of sickness brought
on by hope deferred and waiting and watching each day for a word from the wanderers. We were obliged
to refrain for her sake, but we were all like as if news came from the dead--ten long months and
no word.

After we were somewhat quieted sister Mary read the letter aloud.

It was like reading the last will of the departed, we were all so unnerved. At the close of the
letter we were informed to get in readiness and that the money was already on the way for us.
It had taken over two months for this letter to come by steamer, and we counted the days for
another with the gold to take us away to California. What a consternation this news made in
the congregation! They had hoped that father might return if things were not favorable, but the
letter and the gold in the letter and the money coming to take us away were too true. There
was no hope now that he would return. The successor of father was a young minister, Rev. Henry
Rust.

He heard the news with a sad heart, for he and my sister Mary were betrothed. Father's message
was for sister Mary to take his place as help to mother, who was not able to take the family
alone over the two oceans with all the uncertainty of travel. The weeks of waiting were spent
in preparation. Many busy fingers plied the needle (for sewing machines were not known at that
time). Young as I was, I was no stranger to the use of the needle, for that is part of a German
girl's education, with knitting and crocheting.

I was born in the time of weaving, spinning and carding. Much brass and pewter household articles
were to be kept bright and shiny. Children in those days were little housewives and took as much pride
in having the family silver, copper and brass polished as the older ones. The oaken floors were
made white with soft soap and sand, and the comfortable rugs of rag carpet were woven with
special care. The high-posted bedsteads with the valance around the bottom of white linen,
the canopy above draped with chintz of the daintiest tracings of figures and flowers, and oh, the feather
bed well beaten and made high, and immaculate white quilt finished a bed fit for a king to rest his
royal body upon. While we had not a grand home, it was a place of order, taste and refinement.
Each one was taught to feel responsible for the good or bad impressions
from strangers who visited us from time to time.

Consequently we all took pride in keeping order, which was the law of the home, and as young as
we were we felt justly proud of praise from strangers. After school we had so much to sew,
mend or knit. When that was done, we were allowed to play until six. The evenings were spent in preparing
the lessons for the next day. My early years were spent in work and
play.

Law and order was the rule, but none of us were unhappy by the restraint. It was an education
that has made the men and women of our family what they are today. We were home keepers as
well as entertainers.

Having traveled so much during our lifetime, changing from one city to another, we were not afraid
to take this last long journey. The difficulty was what to take, especially of many of the heirlooms
that mother still retained from her girlhood home. After inquiry and instructions from the
steamship company, we found to our dismay that no furniture could
go, as there was no way of getting it over the Isthmus.

All our long-cherished household furniture must remain behind.

Only things that could be taken up in small boats were allowed. Kind friends of the congregation
made their choice and took them as keepsakes in remembrance of us when we were far away. This
act of kindness was much appreciated by mother, who suffered much anguish of mind to see the
familiar things of her girlhood scattered here and there and her claim to them forever gone.
She had heretofore been able to go willingly to different places because the familiar things
made it homelike when settled in new surroundings, but this time all must be left behind. California
was too far--she was going out to the great unknown world, far from civilization, not knowing
what was before her. If everything else had to be left, she still retained the affection of
her children, and we were as watchful of her happiness and comfort
as if we were her keeper.

Her hopes of meeting father and son, and her children with her, gave her the courage to begin
the long journey.

It was now the year 1851. Mary had been teaching in the public schools and synagogue; sister
Emma was sewing. They kept the finances from running low, as father's salary had to go to his
successor and we had no other means of support. With good management and many friends we all
came safely through the ordeal. After the first letter we had received no other word and the
second year was passing, although we had been ready for months with the disposal of our household
goods. The sisters kept their positions, so all went on as usual. In the latter part of May a rap
was heard at the front door and sister Mary answered the summons and before her stood the express
man of Adams Express Company, and he handed her a canvas sack filled with gold and a letter addressed
to mother from California. Father had sent us $1,600 and orders to come as soon as possible.
He would be awaiting us in Stockton, California.

After our surprise was over, what was to be done with all this money--we could not keep it
here safely. So sister Sarah was dispatched to one of the trustees of the church who had a
safe in his office. The money was placed in a covered basket and she was sent with all haste
to get to the office before closing time, but fate was against her and Mr. Butler had closed
the office and gone. So she was obliged to bring it home once more. It was dark before she came
back and there were two men who followed her at a distance all the way going and coming. What
to do to protect this great amount of money was a vital question. We occupied the first story under
the church and the front rooms faced on Betts street, as did the entrance of the church. The
original parsonage had not been occupied since we vacated it because the new minister had
no family. We still retained the key. After our plans were made, myself and sister Sarah were
sent out on the sidewalk as if we were playing, to see if any strangers were lurking around.
Mother stood in the front door and talked with us while sister Mary,
accompanied by my small brother, took the money and went up to the
other parsonage and let herself in, then into the church.

It was still daylight. So as not to use a light, she quietly slipped into the church, removed
one side of the pulpit steps and let my brother crawl over to the other side and put the gold
beneath the steps there. After depositing it, she quietly put everything in place and returned
to the house. Then we retired for the evening.

None of the neighbors knew of the money being received.

It came at an hour when no one was coming home or happened to be on the sidewalk. The shutters
on the first floor were solid wood so no one could molest us. We had been clearing the house
and packing things away. We were all tired and slept well. Mary and Emma occupied the front
room and for some unknown reason left the wooden bar off that made the door secure, and these
two men came in so quietly that no one heard them.

They had unlocked the doors to escape in case they were discovered. Mother was awakened during
the night and said, "Mary, are you up?" No answer. After a short silence she heard another
sound and she called, "Are you ill, Mary? If you are, I'll get up and help." Receiving no
answer, she reached out to light the candle, but hearing nothing more she thought she had been
mistaken and went to sleep. She arose early and found the shutters unlocked and the side door
ajar. Then she went into the parlor and all the chairs had been taken from the front door where
they had been piled. She immediately realized that there had been robbers in the house searching for
the gold. She awoke the girls and told them of what had happened,
and you can imagine our consternation.

As long as we remained in the house we lived in fear of a second attempt. The next morning
sister Sarah was sent with the gold to our friend, Mr. Butler, who was surprised and simply amazed
at the amount sister gave him to keep. He immediately put it into safer hands at the mint where
the gold was weighed and the value given in money and placed in the bank subject to mother's
order. When Mr. Butler was told of the attempted robbery he immediately arranged to have the
house watched each night until our departure, which came the first week in June, 1851. We left Cincinnati
for New York and were welcomed on our arrival by friends with whom we remained for a week.
On the following Monday we secured passage for California on the steamer Ohio bound for Aspinwall.
I was too young and also too ill to know just the route taken, but after a month we arrived
at Aspinwall, and when our belongings were properly taken care of
we started on our journey across the Isthmus of Panama.

We were nine days going up the Chagres river in flatboats. This trip, girl as I was, I can recall
perfectly and it was an experience which has served in after years
as an education which I have used in many ways.

We, as children, had access to father's great library and magazines
from which we learned so much of foreign countries and people.

I had artistic tastes and I used to find the tropical pictures and scenes much to my liking and
asked many questions in regard to the different people among whom the missionaries worked. I had never
thought ever to see or realize such a picture in the tropics as this. We had a large boat assigned
to our family alone. Our belongings were deposited and two great, black natives were placed
at each end of the boat or scow. They were without clothing, save for a short, full skirt of white
cloth fastened around their waists on a band. Each used a long pole to propel the scow. We
were the only family of women on board the steamer.

There was Mr. Biggar and his wife and a bride and her husband, besides several colored women
and their husbands coming out to take positions on the Pacific steamers. All the other passengers
were men, coming to hunt their fortunes and go back rich. There were about eight or nine of
these scows. The railroad was not finished, but it was being built
at that time.

The surveying was being done and small cabins were built for the surveyors' use at the different
stations where we camped for the night. The captain had provided us with food in cans and packages,
toasted bread and other things for our comfort and utensils for cooking, and we had a jolly
picnic for nine long days before we came to the place where we mounted the burros to take us
the rest of the way to Panama.

To describe this journey needs a more romantic pen than mine, but I'll endeavor to tell you of
some of the features and things that we saw which were so strange and wonderful to me. After we had
said our good-byes to the captain and officers who were so gallant to us and did all they could
for us during the long month on the rough Atlantic, we climbed into our boat and these natives
took charge of it, one at each end, with a guttural grunt from both. They lightly took their
places and we began our journey up the Chagres river.

It was a warm, bright morning, and a light haze in the atmosphere made it appear like spring. At first
we felt afraid of our boatmen, but soon we were drinking in all of
the panoramic effects of the changing scenes of trailing vines, tropical
flowers and other splendors.

The chattering of monkeys and parrots, the alligators lying upon the opposite shore like great
gray logs, some sleeping, some with their great mouths wide open to allow the insects to gather
on their tongues, were things never to be forgotten. I observed that when a large number of
flies had gathered the alligators would close their capacious jaws, satisfied with the sweet
morsel, and roll their eyes with apparent enjoyment. Then they once more slowly opened their
ponderous jaws and quietly waited for another meal. We had gone on our way several hours without
speaking, there was so much to see and it was all so new. The quaint song of the natives amused
us. They never seemed to weary of the same "Yenze, yenze, ah yenze."

At the third "Yenze" the boat would shoot up the stream twice its length. It was nearing noon
and the sun was getting torrid and the air close and stifling. Without any warning the rain showered
upon us and we were obliged to remain in our places and let it come down upon us, regardless
of results to our clothing. The rain was of short duration, however, and we rather enjoyed the
cooling effect.

Presently the sun shone in all its glory and in an hour we were once more with dry clothing. This
mixed weather continued the whole ten days of our journey.

At noon of each day we disembarked and prepared our meal, generally stopping at one of the stations
of the railroad. We found quite a number of white men and Mexicans at each place. They gladly
received us and offered us some of their fare. In exchange we gave them soup, made in a large
kettle, and had several things they were strangers to in their life in the forest of vines, flowers
and fruit of the tropics where they subsisted on rations of pork, bacon, hardtack, etc. They gladly
accepted our fare and we partook of theirs. Before we started again the men came to the boat with baskets
of fresh cut oranges and bananas and plantains. They were for us to take on the steamer and
we could enjoy them as they ripened on the way. We received marked attention from the men at
every station. Women coming to California were a novelty, and when they learned we were all
of one family of the American Padre, they were still more gracious. So we journeyed for ten
days, each day bringing forth some new feature. At night we left the boats and slept in the bungalows
perched high in the air, and to reach them we climbed steps cut out in a large log placed
at the opening. There was only one large room and we all slept on the floor, rolled in our blankets.
We got but little sleep because of the noise from below made by Americans and Spaniards playing
cards and smoking cigarettes and Spanish girls dancing as the men thrummed on the guitars.
The Spaniards carried long knives at their sides and pistols in their belts, wore wide straw
hats and red sashes, black trousers slashed down the side and trimmed
with rows of bright buttons.

High-heeled boots and spurs finished the unique garb. The women wore a white chemise and white
petticoat and slippers. Their black hair, plaited in two braids, and a silk shawl thrown gracefully
over their heads and a fan, which is an indispensable article to a Spanish lady, completed the toilet.
Nothing but troubled sleep came to our relief during these days. Fear of the Spaniards and
the movements of the lizards on the rafters and walls, with now and then a tarantula, made
rest almost impossible. At last we had only one day more, the tenth day. We had gotten familiar
with the different scenes, the waving palms, the trailing vines where the monkeys climbed or hung
by their tails and chattered in their own way. The scarlet lingawacha, or tongue plant, hung
in graceful lengths and brightened the varied colored green in the background. Innumerable families
of parrots talked and screamed from the branches. Bananas and orange trees everywhere interspersed
with tall cocoanut palms, the large and small alligators basking in the sun on the sand were pictures
never to be forgotten. The natives in their peculiar dress, the fandango at night, the graceful
twirl of the Spanish waltz put the life touch to the picture that comes to me today at the age
of seventy-five as it was in those days when I experienced, a girl
of fifteen, all the discomforts of travel from Cincinnati to California.

It

was about 4 o'clock on the tenth day when we arrived at the small village where we were to
remain for the night and next morning, then ho! for Panama. We had better accommodations here,
a large adobe house, kept by a Spaniard and wife and daughters, under the supervision of the
steamship company, which also controlled the scows that we used on the river Chagres. Our goods
were transferred from the scows to the pack mule train. After everything had been safely lashed
upon their backs, our burros were brought and we all mounted astride. It was well for us we were
no strangers to riding.

My youngest brother was too small to ride, so a large native bamboo chair was brought and strapped
upon the back of a large native and in the chair, safely tied in, sat the brother, as contented
as a lord. He was such a handsome child, mother did not want to have the native take him for fear
he would steal him, so she had the slave start first and she came behind and rode with him in sight
all the way, but she was unnecessarily alarmed, for he was most faithful.

The day before we left for the steamer he came with an offering of fruit and nuts for the boy and
the madre and senoritas. Mother gave him an extra dollar and he was greatly surprised and smilingly
picked up brother and carried him to the steamer and assisted us in every way until we were safely
transferred to the steamship Tennessee, Captain Totten, commander. The ride on the burros over
mountains, hills and dales was an experience never to be forgotten. Slowly, step by step we wound
around the mountain trail. These burros had gone the road so many years that their tiny hoofs had
worn places in the rocks. All we had to do was to sit tight in the saddle as we ascended or descended
the steep places. The pummel of the saddle was high and we held on to that, and enjoyed the
novelty of the situation. Once or twice we merged into a plain of a mile or so, then began
the rocky ascent. We refreshed ourselves from time to time at cooling springs that dripped
out from the rocks into a rustic stone basin.

The scenery was very attractive, but it became monotonous as we sat in our saddles while the
burros, step by step, ascended or descended the path they had traversed so often. Toward night
the mountains became more like rolling hills and there was more open space and sky to be seen.
By the time darkness overtook us we were near the outskirts of Panama and hoped soon to see the
lights of the city. About nine o'clock we stopped before an adobe building, long and wide,
two stories high, with a large enclosed place for the burros.

This was also under the steamship company's control. This time the proprietor was a white
man and we were able to obtain desirable beds and comfortable fare. He gave us the best rooms,
large and clean, more homelike than anything we had seen since leaving home. We were so weary
it was with difficulty we got off the burros, having ridden all day long. I could hardly feel
the earth under me and I staggered many times before we were comfortable in our rooms. After resting
for an hour we were summoned to supper. It was now ten o'clock. Late as it was, we found the supper
so appetizing we forgot the hour and really enjoyed the first good
meal in the ten days we were on the way.

 First life was like a rabble, a mob, without thought or head, then slowly organization
went on, as it were, from family to clan, from clan to tribe, from tribe to nation, or centralized
government--the brain of man--all parts duly subordinated and directed,--millions of cells
organized and working on different functions to one grand end,--cooperation, fraternization,
division of labor, altruism, etc.

The cell was the first invention; it is the unit of life,--a speck of protoplasm with a nucleus.
To educate this cell till it could combine with its fellows and form the higher animals seems
to have been the aim of the creative energy. First the cell, then combinations of cells, then
combinations of combinations, then more and more complex combinations till the body of man
is reached, where endless confraternities of cells, all with different functions, working to
build and sustain different organs,--brain, heart, liver, muscles, nerves,--yet all working
together for one grand end--the body and mind of man. In their last analysis, all made up of
the same cells--their combinations and organization making the different forms.

Evolution touches all forms but tarries with few. Many are called but few are chosen--chosen
to lead the man-impulse upward. Myriads of forms are left behind, like driftwood caught in
the eddies of a current. The clam has always remained a clam, the oyster remained an oyster.
The cockroach is about the same creature to-day that it was untold aeons ago; so is the shark,
and so are many other forms of marine life. Often where old species have gone out and new come
in, no progress has been made.

Evolution concentrates along certain lines. The biological tree behaves like another tree,
branches die and drop off (species become extinct), others mature and remain, while some central
shoot pushes upward. Many of the huge reptilian and mammalian branches perished in comparatively
late times.

As nothing is more evident than that the same measure of life or of vital energy--power of
growth, power of resistance, power of reproduction--is not meted out equally to all the individuals
of a species, or to all species, so it is evident that this power of progressive development
is not meted out equally to all races of mankind, or to all of the individuals of the same
race. The central impulse of development seems to have come from the East, in historic times
at least, and to have followed the line of the Mediterranean, to have culminated in Europe.
And this progress has certainly been the work of a few minds--minds exceptionally endowed.

For the most part the barbarian races do not progress. Their exceptional minds or characters
do not lead the tribes to higher planes of thought, In all countries we still see these barbarous
people which man in his progress has left behind. Our civilization is like a field of light
that fades off into shadows and darkness. There is this margin of undeveloped humanity on all
sides. Always has it been so in the animal life of the globe; the higher forms have been pushed
up from the lower, and the lower have remained and continued to multiply unchanged.

It seems as if some central and cherished impulse had pushed on through each form, and by successive
steps had climbed from height to height, gaining a little here and a little there, intensifying
and concentrating as time went on, very vague and diffuse at first, embryonic so to speak,
during the first half of the great geologic year, but quickening more and more, differentiating
more and more, delayed and defeated many times, no doubt, yet never destroyed, leaving form
after form unchanged behind it, till it at last reached its goal in man.

After evolution has done all it can do for us toward solving the mystery of creation, much
remains unsolved.

Through evolution we see creation in travail-pains for millions of years to bring forth the
varied forms of life as we know them; but the mystery of the inception of this life, and of
the origin of the laws that have governed its development, remains. What lies back of it all?
Who or what planted the germ of the biological tree, and predetermined all its branches? What
determined one branch to eventuate in man, another in the dog, the horse, the bird, or the reptile?

From the finite or human point of view we feel compelled to say some vaster being or intelligence
must have had the thought of all these things from the beginning or before the beginning.

It is quite impossible for me to believe that fortuitous variation--variation all around the
circle--could have resulted in the evolution of man. There must have been a predetermined tendency
to variation in certain directions. To introduce chance into the world is to introduce chaos.
No more would the waters of the interiors of the continents find their way to the sea, were
there not a slant in that direction, than could haphazard variation, though checked and controlled
by natural selection, result in the production of the race of man. This view may be only the
outcome of our inevitable anthropomorphism which we cannot escape from, no matter how deep
we dive or high we soar.

II

THE DIVINE ABYSS

I

In making the journey to the great Southwest,--Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona,--if one does
not know his geology, he is pretty sure to wish he did, there is so much geology scattered
over all these Southwestern landscapes, crying aloud to be read. The book of earthly revelation,
as shown by the great science, lies wide open in that land, as it does in few other places
on the globe. Its leaves fairly flutter in the wind, and the print is so large that he who
runs on the California Limited may read it. Not being able to read it at all, or not taking
any interest in it, is like going to Rome or Egypt or Jerusalem, knowing nothing of the history
of those lands.

Of course, we have just as much geology in the East and Middle West, but the books are closed
and sealed, as it were, by the enormous lapse of time since these portions of the continent
became dry land. The eroding and degrading forces have ages since passed the meridian of their
day's work, and grass and verdure hide their footsteps. But in the great West and Southwest,
the gods of erosion and degradation seem yet in the heat and burden of the day's toil. Their
unfinished landscapes meet the eye on every hand. Many of the mountains look as if they were
blocked out but yesterday, and one sees vast naked flood-plains, and painted deserts and bad
lands and dry lake-bottoms, that suggest a world yet in the making.

Some force has scalped the hills, ground the mountains, strangled the rivers, channeled the
plains, laid bare the succession of geologic ages, stripping off formation after formation
like a garment, or cutting away the strata over hundreds of square miles, as we pry a slab
from a rock--and has done it all but yesterday. If we break the slab in the prying, and thus
secure only part of it, leaving an abrupt jagged edge on the part that remains, we have still
a better likeness of the work of these great geologic quarrymen. But other workmen, invisible
to our eyes, have carved these jagged edges into novel and beautiful forms.

The East is old, old! the West, with the exception of the Rocky Mountains, is of yesterday
in comparison. The Hudson was an ancient river before the Mississippi was born, and the Catskills
were being slowly carved from a vast plateau while the rocks that were to form many of the
Western ranges were being laid down as sediment in the bottom of the sea. California is yet
in her teens, while New England in comparison is an octogenarian. Just as much geology in the
East as in the West, did I say? Not as much visible geology, not as much by many chapters of
earth history, not as much by all the later formations, by most of the Mesozoic and Tertiary
deposits. The vast series of sedimentary rocks since the Carboniferous age, to say nothing
of the volcanic, that make up these periods, are largely wanting east of the Mississippi, except
in New Jersey and in some of the Gulf States. They are recent. They are like the history of
our own period compared with that of Egypt and Judea. It is mainly these later formations--the
Permian, the Jurassic, the Triassic, the Cretaceous, the Eocene,--that give the prevailing
features to the South-western landscape that so astonish Eastern eyes. From them come most
of the petrified remains of that great army of extinct reptiles and mammals--the three-toed
horse, the sabre-toothed tiger, the brontosaurus, the fin-backed lizard, the imperial mammoth,
the various dinosaurs, some of them gigantic in form and fearful in aspect--that of late years
have appeared in our museums and that throw so much light upon the history of the animal life
of the globe. Most of the sedimentary rocks of New York and New England were laid down before
these creatures existed.

Now I am not going to write an essay on the geology of the West, for I really have little first-hand
knowledge upon that subject, but I would indicate the kind of interest in the country I was
most conscious of during my recent trip to the Pacific Coast and beyond. Indeed, quite a geologic
fever raged in me most of the time. The rocks attracted me more than the birds, the sculpturing
of the landscapes engaged my attention more than the improvements of the farms--what Nature
had done more than what man was doing. The purely scenic aspects of the country are certainly
remarkable, and the human aspects interesting, but underneath these things, and striking through
them, lies a vast world of time and change that to me is still more remarkable, and still more
interesting. I could not look out of the car windows without seeing the spectre of geologic
time stalking across the hills and plains.

As one leaves the prairie States and nears the great Southwest, he finds Nature in a new mood--she
is dreaming of canyons; both cliffs and soil have canyon stamped upon them, so that your eye,
if alert, is slowly prepared for the wonders of rock-carving it is to see on the Colorado.
The canyon form seems inherent in soil and rock. The channels of the little streams are canyons,
vertical sides of adobe soil, as deep as they are broad, rectangle grooves in the ground.

Through all this arid region nature is abrupt, angular, and sudden--the plain squarely abutting
the cliff, the cliff walling the canon; the dry water-course sunk in the plain like a carpenter's
groove into a plank. Cloud and sky look the same as at home, but the earth is a new earth--new
geologically, and new in the lines of its landscapes. It seems by the forms she develops that
Nature must use tools that she long since discarded in the East. She works as if with the square
and the saw and the compass, and uses implements that cut like chisels and moulding-planes.
Right lines, well-defined angles, and tablelike tops of buttes and mesas alternate with perfect
curves, polished domes, carved needles, and fluted escarpments.

In the features of our older landscapes there is little or nothing that suggests architectural
forms or engineering devices; in the Far West one sees such forms and devices everywhere.

In visiting the Petrified Forests in northern Arizona we stood on the edge of a great rolling
plain and looked down upon a wide, deeply eroded stretch of country below us that suggested
a vast army encampment, covered as it was with great dome-shaped, tent-like mounds of a light
terra-cotta color, with open spaces like streets or avenues between them. There were hundreds
or thousands of these earthy tents stretching away for twenty-five miles. Along the horizon
was a gigantic stockade of red, rounded pillars, or a solid line of mosque-like temples. How
unreal, how spectral it all seemed! Not a sound or sign of life in the whole painted solitude--a
deserted camp, or one upon which the silence of death had fallen. Here, in Carboniferous times,
grew the gigantic fern-like trees, the Sigillaria and Lepidodendron, whose petrified trunks,
for aeons buried beneath the deposit of the Permian seas, and then, during other aeons, slowly
uncovered by the gentle action of the eroding rains, we saw scattered on the ground.

You first see Nature beginning to form the canon habit in Colorado and making preliminary studies
for her masterpiece, the Grand Canon. Huge square towers and truncated cones and needles and
spires break the horizon-lines. Here all her water-courses, wet or dry, are deep grooves in
the soil, with striking and pretty carvings and modelings adorning their vertical sides. In
the railway cuts you see the same effects--miniature domes and turrets and other canon features
carved out by the rains. The soil is massive and does not crumble like ours and seek the angle
of repose; it gives way in masses like a brick wall. It is architectural soil, it seeks approximately
the right angle--the level plain or the vertical wall. It erodes easily under running water,
but it does not slide; sand and clay are in such proportions as to make a brittle but not a
friable soil.

Before you are out of Colorado, you begin to see these novel architectural features on the
horizon-line--the canon turned bottom side up, as it were. In New Mexico, the canon habit of
the erosion forces is still more pronounced. The mountain-lines are often as architectural
in the distance, or arbitrary, as the sky-line of a city. You may see what you half persuade
yourself is a huge brick building notching the horizon,--an asylum, a seminary, a hotel,--but
it is only a fragment of red sandstone, carved out by wind and rain.

Presently the high colors of the rocks appear--high cliffs with terra-cotta facades, and a
new look in the texture of the rocks, a soft, beaming, less frowning expression, and colored
as if by the Western sunsets. We are looking upon much younger rocks geologically than we see
at home, and they have the tints and texture of youth. The landscape and the mountains look
young, because they look unfinished, like a house half up. The workmen have but just knocked
off work to go to dinner; their great trenches, their freshly opened quarries, their huge dumps,
their foundations, their cyclopean masonry, their half-finished structures breaking the horizon-lines,
their square gashes through the mountains,--all impress the eyes of a traveler from the eastern
part of the continent, where the earth-building and earth-carving forces finished their work
ages ago.

II

Hence it is that when one reaches the Grand canon of the Colorado, if he has kept his eyes
and mind open, he is prepared to see striking and unusual things. But he cannot be fully prepared
for just what he does see, no matter how many pictures of it he may have seen, or how many
descriptions of it he may have read.

A friend of mine who took a lively interest in my Western trip wrote me that he wished he could
have been present with his kodak when we first looked upon the Grand Canon. Did he think he
could have got a picture of our souls? His camera would have shown him only our silent, motionless
forms as we stood transfixed by that first view of the stupendous spectacle. Words do not come
readily to one's lips, or gestures to one's body, in the presence of such a scene. One of my
companions said that the first thing that came into her mind was the old text, "Be still, and
know that I am God." To be still on such an occasion is the easiest thing in the world, and
to feel the surge of solemn and reverential emotions is equally easy; is, indeed, almost inevitable.
The immensity of the scene, its tranquillity, its order, its strange, new beauty, and the monumental
character of its many forms--all these tend to beget in the beholder an attitude of silent
wonder and solemn admiration. I wished at the moment that we might have been alone with the
glorious spectacle,--that we had hit upon an hour when the public had gone to dinner. The smoking
and joking tourists sauntering along in apparent indifference, or sitting with their backs
to the great geologic drama, annoyed me. I pity the person who can gaze upon the spectacle
unmoved. Some are actually terrified by it. I was told of a strong man, an eminent lawyer from
a Western city, who literally fell to the earth at the first view, and could not again be induced
to look upon it. I saw a woman prone upon the ground near the brink at Hopi Point, weeping
silently and long; but from what she afterward told me I know it was not from terror or sorrow,
but from the overpowering gladness of the ineffable beauty and harmony of the scene. It moved
her like the grandest music. Her inebriate soul could find relief only in tears.

Harriet Monroe was so wrought up by the first view that she says she had to fight against the
desperate temptation to fling herself down into the soft abyss, and thus redeem the affront
which the very beating of her heart had offered to the inviolable solitude.

It is beautiful, oh, how beautiful! but it is a beauty that awakens a feeling of solemnity
and awe. We call it the "Divine Abyss." It seems as much of heaven as of earth. Of the many
descriptions of it, none seems adequate. To rave over it, or to pour into it a torrent of superlatives,
is of little avail. My companion came nearer the mark when she quietly repeated from Revelation,
"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great
city, the holy Jerusalem." It does, indeed, suggest a far-off, half-sacred antiquity, some
greater Jerusalem, Egypt, Babylon, or India. We speak of it as a scene: it is more like a vision,
so foreign is it to all other terrestrial spectacles, and so surpassingly beautiful.

To ordinary folk the sight is so extraordinary, so unlike everything one's experience has yielded,
and so unlike the results of the usual haphazard working of the blind forces of nature, that
I did not wonder when people whom I met on the rim asked me what I supposed did all this. I
could even sympathize with the remark of an old woman visitor who is reported to have said
that she thought they had built the canon too near the hotel. The enormous cleavage which the
canon shows, the abrupt drop from the brink of thousands of feet, the sheer faces of perpendicular
walls of dizzy height, give at first the impression that it is all the work of some titanic
quarryman, who must have removed cubic miles of strata as we remove cubic yards of earth. Go
out to Hopi Point or O'Neil's Point, and, as you emerge from the woods, you get a glimpse of
a blue or rose-purple gulf opening before you. The solid ground ceases suddenly, and an aerial
perspective, vast and alluring, takes its place; another heaven, countersunk in the earth,
transfixes you on the brink. "Great God!" I can fancy the first beholder of it saying, "what
is this? Do I behold the transfiguration of the earth? Has the solid ground melted into thin
air? Is there a firmament below as well as above? Has the earth veil at last been torn aside,
and the red heart of the globe been laid bare?" If this first witness was not at once overcome
by the beauty of the earthly revelation before him, or terrified by its strangeness and power,
he must have stood long, awed, spellbound, speechless with astonishment, and thrilled with
delight. He may have seen vast and glorious prospects from mountaintops, he may have looked
down upon the earth and seen it unroll like a map before him; but he had never before looked
into the earth as through a mighty window or open door, and beheld depths and gulfs of space,
with their atmospheric veils and illusions and vast perspectives, such as he had seen from
mountain-summits, but with a wealth of color and a suggestion of architectural and monumental
remains, and a strange, almost unearthly beauty, such as no mountain-view could ever have afforded
him. Three features of the canon strike one at once: its unparalleled magnitude, its architectural
forms and suggestions, and its opulence of color effects--a chasm nearly a mile deep and from
ten to twenty miles wide, in which Niagara would be only as a picture upon your walls, in which
the Pyramids, seen from the rim, would appear only like large tents, in which the largest building
upon the earth would dwindle to insignificant proportions. There are amphitheatres and mighty
aisles eight miles long and three or four miles wide and three or four thousand feet deep.
There are room-like spaces eight hundred feet high; there are well-defined alcoves with openings
a mile wide; there are niches six hundred feet high overhung by arched lintels; there are pinnacles
and rude statues from one hundred to two hundred feet high. Here I am running at once into
allusions to the architectural features and suggestions of the canon, which must play a prominent
part in all faithful attempts to describe it. There are huge, truncated towers, vast, horizontal
mouldings; there is the semblance of balustrades on the summit of a noble facade. In one of
the immense halls we saw, on an elevated platform, the outlines of three enormous chairs, fifty
feet or more high, and behind and above them the suggestion of three more chairs in partial
ruin. Indeed, there is such an opulence of architectural forms in this divine abyss as one
has never before dreamed of seeing wrought by the blind forces of nature. These forces have
here foreshadowed all the noblest architecture of the world. Many of the vast carved and ornamental
masses which diversify the canon have been fitly named temples, as Shiva's Temple, a mile high,
carved out of the red Carboniferous limestone, and remarkably symmetrical in its outlines.
Near it is the Temple of Isis, the Temple of Osiris, the Buddha Temple, the Horus Temple, and
the Pyramid of Cheops. Farther to the east is the Diva Temple, the Brahma Temple, the Temple
of Zoroaster, and the Tomb of Odin. Indeed, everywhere are there suggestions of temples and
tombs, pagodas and pyramids, on a scale that no work of human hands can rival. "The grandest
objects," says Major Dutton, "are merged in a congregation of others equally grand." With the
wealth of form goes a wealth of color. Never, I venture to say, were reds and browns and grays
and vermilions more appealing to the eye than they are as they softly glow in this great canyon.
The color-scheme runs from the dark, sombre hue of the gneiss at the bottom, up through the
yellowish brown of the Cambrian layers, and on up through seven or eight broad bands of varying
tints of red and vermilion, to the broad yellowish-gray at the top.

III

The north side of the canyon has been much more deeply and elaborately carved than the south
side; most of the great architectural features are on the north side--the huge temples and
fortresses and amphitheatres. The strata dip very gently to the north and northeast, while
the slope of the surface is to the south and southeast. This has caused the drainage from the
great northern plateaus to flow into the canyon and thus cut and carve the north side as we
behold it.

The visitor standing upon the south side looks across the great chasm upon the bewildering
maze of monumental forms, some of them as suggestive of human workmanship as anything in nature
well can be, --crumbling turrets and foundations, forms as distinctly square as any work of
man's hands, vast fortress-like structures with salients and entering angles and wing walls
resisting the siege of time, huge pyramidal piles rising story on story, three thousand feet
or more above their foundations, each successive story or superstructure faced by a huge vertical
wall which rises from a sloping talus that connects it with the story next below. The slopes
or taluses represent the softer rock, the vertical walls the harder layers. Usually four or
five of these receding stories make up each temple or pyramid. Some of the larger structures
show all the strata from the cap of light Carboniferous limestone at the top to the gray Cambrian
sandstone at the bottom. From others, such as the Temple of Isis, all the upper formations
are gone with a pile of disintegrated red sandstone, like a mass of brick dust on the top where
the fragment of the old red wall made its last stand. In those masses, which are still crowned
with the light gray limestone, one sees how surely the process of disintegration is going on
by the fragments and debris of light gray rock, like the chips of giant workmen, that strew
the deeper-colored slopes below them. These fragments fade out as the eye drops down the slopes,
as if they had melted like bits of ice. Indeed, the melting of ice and the dissolution of a
rock do not differ much except that one is very rapid and the other infinitely slow. In time
(not man's time, but the Lord's time), all these light masses that cap the huge temples will
be weathered away, yea, and all the vast red layers beneath them, and the huge structures will
be slowly consumed by time. The Colorado River will carry their ashes to the sea, and where
they once stood will be seen gray, desert-like plateaus. Their outlines now stand out like
skeletons from which the flesh has been removed--sharp, angular, obtrusive, but bound together
as by ligaments of granite. The tooth of time gnaws at them day and night and has been gnawing
for thousands of centuries, so that in some cases only their stumps remain. From the Temple
of Isis and the Tomb of Odin the two or three upper stories are gone.

On the next page is the ground plan of the Temple of Isis, about twenty-five hundred feet high.
The first story is about a thousand feet; the second, three hundred and fifty feet; the third,
one hundred and fifty feet; the fourth, five hundred feet; and the fifth, five hundred feet.
The finish at the top shows as a heavy crumbling wall, probably one hundred feet or more high.
How the mass seems to be resisting the siege of time, throwing out its salients here and there,
and meeting the onset of the foes like a military engineer.

The pyramidal form of these rock-masses is accounted for by the fact that they were carved
out from the top downward, and that each successive story is vastly older than the one immediately
beneath it. The erosive forces have been working whole geologic ages longer on the top layer
of rock than on the bottom layer; hence the topmost ones are entirely gone or else reduced
to small dimensions. But what feature or quality of the rock it is that lends itself so readily
or so inevitably to these architectural forms--the four square foundations, the end pilasters
and balustrades, and so on--is to me not so clear. The peculiar rectangular jointings, the
alternation of soft and hard layers, the nearly horizontal strata, and other things, no doubt,
enter into the problem. Many of these features are found in our older geology of the East,
as in the Catskills --horizontal strata, hard and soft layers alternating, but with the vertical
jointing less pronounced; hence the Catskills have few canon-like valleys, though there are
here and there huge gashes through the mountains that give a canon effect, and there are gigantic
walls high up on the face of some of the mountains that suggest one side of a mighty canon.
In the climate of the Catskills the rock-masses of the Colorado would crumble much more rapidly
than they do here. The lines of many of these natural temples or fortresses are still more
lengthened and attenuated than those of the Temple of Isis, appearing like mere skeletons of
their former selves. The forms that weather out the formation above this, the Permian, appear
to be more rotund, and tend more to domes and rounded hills.

One of the most surprising features of the Grand canon is its cleanness--its freedom from debris.
It is a home of the gods, swept and garnished; no litter or confusion or fragments of fallen
and broken rocky walls anywhere. Those vast sloping taluses are as clean as a meadow; rarely
at the foot of the huge vertical walls do you see a fragment of fallen rock. It is as if the
processes of erosion and degradation were as gentle as the dews and the snows, and carved out
this mighty abyss grain by grain, which has probably been the case. That much of this red sandstone,
from the amount of iron it contains, or from some other cause, disintegrates easily and rapidly,
is very obvious. Looking down from Hopi Point upon a vast ridge called the "Man-of-War," one
sees on the top, where once there must have been a huge wall of rock, a long level area of
red soil that suggests a garden, the more so because it is regularly divided up into sections
by straight lines of huge stone placed as if by the hands of man.

One's sense of the depths of the canyon is so great that it almost makes one dizzy to see the
little birds fly out over it, or plunge down into it. One seems to fear that they too will
get dizzy and fall to the bottom. We watched a line of tourists on mules creeping along the
trail across the inner plateau, and the unaided eye had trouble to hold them; they looked like
little red ants. The eye has more difficulty in estimating sizes and distances beneath it than
when they are above or on a level with it, because it is so much less familiar with depth than
with height or lateral dimensions.

Another remarkable and unexpected feature of the canyon is its look of ordered strength. Nearly
all the lines are lines of greatest strength. The prevailing profile line everywhere is that
shown herewith. The upright lines represent lines of cyclopean masonry, and the slant is the
talus that connects them, covered with a short, sage-colored growth of some kind, and as soft
to the eye as the turf of our fields. The simple, strong structural lines assert themselves
everywhere, and give that look of repose and security characteristic of the scene. The rocky
forces always seem to retreat in good order before the onslaught of time; there is neither
rout nor confusion; everywhere they present a calm upright front to the foe. And the fallen
from their ranks, where are they? A cleaner battlefield between the forces of nature one rarely
sees.

The weaker portions are, of course, constantly giving way. The elements incessantly lay siege
to these fortresses and take advantage of every flaw or unguarded point, so that what stands
has been seven times, yea, seventy times seven times tested, and hence gives the impression
of impregnable strength. The angles and curves, the terraces and foundations, seem to be the
work of some master engineer, with only here and there a toppling rock.

I was puzzled to explain to myself the reason of a certain friendly and familiar look which
the great abyss had for me. One sees or feels at a glance that it was not born of the throes
and convulsions of nature--of earthquake shock or volcanic explosion. It does not suggest the
crush of matter and the wreck of worlds. Clearly it is the work of the more gentle and beneficent
forces. This probably accounts for the friendly look. Some of the inner slopes and plateaus
seemed like familiar ground to me: I must have played upon them when a school-boy. Bright Angel
Creek, for some inexplicable reason, recalled a favorite trout-stream of my native hills, and
the old Cambrian plateau that edges the inner chasm, as we looked down upon it from nearly
four thousand feet above, looked like the brown meadow where we played ball in the old school-days,
friendly, tender, familiar, in its slopes and terraces, in its tints and basking sunshine,
but grand and awe-inspiring in its depths, its huge walls, and its terrific precipices.

The geologists are agreed that the canyon is only of yesterday in geologic time,--the Middle
Tertiary,--and yet behold the duration of that yesterday as here revealed, probably a million
years or more! We can no more form any conception of such time than we can of the size of the
sun or of the distance of the fixed stars.

The forces that did all this vast delving and sculpturing--the air, the rains, the frost, the
sunshine--are as active now as they ever were; but their activity is a kind of slumbering that
rarely makes a sign. Only at long intervals is the silence of any part of the profound abyss
broken by the fall of loosened rocks or sliding talus. We ourselves saw where a huge splinter
of rock had recently dropped from the face of the cliff. In time these loosened masses disappear,
as if they melted like ice. A city not made with hands, but as surely not eternal in the earth!
In our humid and severe Eastern climate, frost and ice and heavyrains working together, all
these architectural forms would have crumbled long ago, and fertile fields or hill-slopes would
have taken their place. In the older Hawaiian Islands, which probably also date from Tertiary
times, the rains have carved enormous canons and amphitheatres out of the hard volcanic rock,
in some places grinding the mountains to such a thin edge that a man may literally sit astride
them, each leg pointing into opposite valleys. In the next geologic age, the temples and monuments
of the Grand Canon will have largely disappeared, and the stupendous spectacle will be mainly
a thing of the past.

It seems to take millions of years to tame a mountain, to curb its rude, savage power, to soften
its outlines, and bring fertility out of the elemental crudeness and barrenness. But time and
the gentle rains of heaven will do it, as they have done it in the East, and as they are fast
doing it in the West.

An old guide with whom I talked, who had lived in and about the canon for twenty-six years,
said, "While we have been sitting here, the canon has widened and deepened"; which was, of
course, the literal truth, the mathematical truth, but the widening and deepening could not
have been apprehended by human sense.

Our little span of human life is far too narrow for us to be a witness of any of the great
earth changes. These changes are so slow,--oh, so slow,--and human history is so brief. So
far as we are concerned, the gods of the earth sit in council behind closed doors. All the
profound, formative, world-shaping forces of nature go on in a realm that we can reach only
through our imaginations. They so far transcend our human experiences that it requires an act
of faith to apprehend them. The repose of the hills and the mountains, how profound! yet they
may be rising or sinking before our very eyes, and we detect no sign. Only on exceptional occasions,
during earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, is their dreamless slumber rudely disturbed.

Geologists tell us that from the great plateau in which the Grand Canon is cut, layers of rock
many thousands of feet thick were cut away before the canon was begun.

Starting from the high plateau of Utah, and going south toward the canon, we descend a grand
geologic stairway, every shelf or tread of which consists of different formations fifty or
more miles broad, from the Eocene, at an altitude of over ten thousand feet at the start, across
the Cretaceous, the Jurassic, the Triassic, the Permian, to the Carboniferous, which is the
bottom or landing of the Grand Canon plateau at an altitude of about five thousand feet. Each
step terminates more or less abruptly, the first by a drop of eight hundred feet, ornamented
by rows of square obelisks and pilasters of uniform pattern and dimension, "giving the effect,"
says Major Dutton, "of a gigantic colonnade from which the entablature has been removed or
has fallen in ruins."

The next step, or platform, the Cretaceous, slopes down gradually or dies out on the step beneath
it; then comes the Jurassic, which ends in white sandstone cliffs several hundred feet high;
then the Triassic, which ends in the famous vermilion cliffs thousands of feet high, most striking
in color and in form; then the Permian tread, which also ends in striking cliffs, with their
own style of color and architecture; and, lastly, the great Carboniferous platform in which
the canon itself is carved. Now, all these various strata above the canon, making at one time
a thickness of over a mile, were worn away in Pliocene times, before the cutting of the Grand
Canon began. Had they remained, and been cut through, we should have had a chasm two miles
deep instead of one mile.

The cutting power of a large, rapid volume of water, like the Colorado, charged with sand and
gravel, is very great. According to Major Dutton, in the hydraulic mines of California, the
escaping water has been known to cut a chasm from twelve to twenty feet deep in hard basaltic
rock, in a single year. This is, of course, exceptional, but there have, no doubt, been times
when the Colorado cut downward very rapidly. The enormous weathering of its side walls is to
me the more wonderful, probably because the forces that have achieved this task are silent
and invisible, and, so far as our experience goes, so infinitely slow in their action. The
river is a tremendous machine for grinding and sawing and transporting, but the rains and the
frost and the air and the sunbeams smite the rocks as with weapons of down, and one is naturally
incredulous as to their destructive effects.

Some of the smaller rivers in the plateau region flow in very deep but very narrow canons.
The rocks being harder and more homogeneous, the weathering has been slight. The meteoric forces
have not taken a hand in the game. Thus the Parunuweap Canon is only twenty to thirty feet
wide, but from six hundred to fifteen hundred feet deep.

I suppose the slow, inappreciable erosion to which the old guide alluded would have cut the
canon since Middle Tertiary times. The river, eating downward at the rate of one sixteenth
of an inch a year, would do it in about one million years. At half that rate it would do it
in double that time. In the earlier part of its history, when the rainfall was doubtless greater,
and the river fuller, the erosion must have been much more rapid than it is at present. The
widening of the canon was doubtless a slower process than the downward cutting. But, as I have
said, the downward cutting would tend to check itself from age to age, while the widening process
would go steadily forward. Hence, when we look into the great abyss, we have only to remember
the enormous length of time that the aerial and subaerial forces have been at work to account
for it.

Two forces, or kinds of forces, have worked together in excavating the canon: the river, which
is the primary factor, and the meteoric forces, which may be called the secondary, as they
follow in the wake of the former. The river starts the gash downward, then the aerial forces
begin to eat into the sides. Acting alone, the river would cut a trench its own width, and
were the rocks through which it saws one homogeneous mass, or of uniform texture and hardness,
the width of the trench would probably have been very uniform and much less than it is now.
The condition that has contributed to its great width is the heterogeneity of the different
formations--some hard and some soft. The softer bands, of course, introduce the element of
weakness. They decay and crumble the more rapidly, and thus undermine the harder bands overlying
them, which, by reason of their vertical fractures, break off and fall to the bottom, where
they are exposed to the action of floods and are sooner or later ground up in the river's powerful
maw. Hence the recession of the banks of the canon has gone steadily on with the downward cutting
of the river. Where the rock is homogeneous, as it is in the inner chasm of the dark gneiss,
the widening process seems to have gone on much more slowly. Geologists account for the great
width of the main chasm when compared with the depth, on the theory that the forces that work
laterally have been more continuously active than has the force that cuts downward. There is
convincing evidence that the whole region has been many times lifted up since the cutting began,
so that the river has had its active and passive stages. As its channel approached the sea
level, its current would be much less rapid, and the downward cutting would practically cease,
till the section was elevated again. But all the time the forces working laterally would be
at work without interruption, and would thus gain on their checked brethren of the river bottom.

There is probably another explanation of what we see here. Apart from the mechanical weathering
of the rocks as a result of the arid climate, wherein rapid and often extreme changes of temperature
take place, causing the surface of the rocks to flake or scale off, there has doubtless been
unusual chemical weathering, and this has been largely brought about by the element of iron
that all these rocks possess. Their many brilliant colors are imparted to them by the various
compounds of iron which enter into their composition. And iron, though the symbol of hardness
and strength, is an element of weakness in rocks, as it causes them to oxidize or disintegrate
more rapidly. In the marble canon, where apparently the rock contains no iron, the lateral
erosion has been very little, though the river has cut a trench as deep as it has in other
parts of its course.

How often I thought during those days at the canon of the geology of my native hills amid the
Catskills, which show the effects of denudation as much older than that shown here as this
is older than the washout in the road by this morning's shower! The old red sandstone in which
I hoed corn as a farm-boy dates back to Middle Palaeozoic time, or to the spring of the great
geologic year, while the canon is of the late autumn. Could my native hills have replied to
my mute questionings, they would have said: "We were old, old, and had passed through the canon
stage long before the Grand Canon was born. We have had all that experience, and have forgotten
it ages ago. No vestiges of our canons remain. They have all been worn down and obliterated
by the strokes of a hand as gentle as that of a passing cloud. Where they were, are now broad,
fertile valleys, with rounded knolls and gentle slopes, and the sound of peaceful husbandry.
The great ice sheet rubbed us and ploughed us, but our contours were gentle and rounded aeons
before that event. When the Grand Canon is as old as we are, all its superb architectural features
will have long since disappeared, its gigantic walls will have crumbled, and rolling plains
and gentle valleys will have taken its place." All of which seems quite probable. With time
enough, the gentle forces of air and water will surely change the whole aspect of this tremendous
chasm.

On the second day we made the descent into the canon on mule-back. There is always satisfaction
in going to the bottom of things. Then we wanted to get on more intimate terms with the great
abyss, to wrestle with it, if need be, and to feel its power, as well as to behold it. It is
not best always to dwell upon the rim of things or to look down upon them from afar. The summits
are good, but the valleys have their charm, also; even the valley of humiliation has its lessons.
At any rate, four of us were unanimous in our desire to sound that vast profound on mule-back,
trusting that the return trip would satisfy our "climbing" aspirations, as it did.

It is quite worth while to go down into the canon on mule-back, if only to fall in love with
a mule, and to learn what a sure-footed, careful, and docile creature, when he is on his good
behavior, a mule can be. My mule was named "Johnny," and there was soon a good understanding
between us. I quickly learned to turn the whole problem of that perilous descent over to him.
He knew how to take the sharp turns and narrow shelves of that steep zigzag much better than
I did. I do not fancy that the thought of my safety was "Johnny's" guiding star; his solicitude
struck nearer home than that. There was much ice and snow on the upper part of the trail, and
only those slender little legs of "Johnny's" stood between me and a tumble of two or three
thousand feet. How cautiously he felt his way with his round little feet, as, with lowered
head, he seemed to be scanning the trail critically! Only when he swung around the sharp elbows
of the trail did his forefeet come near the edge of the brink. Only once or twice at such times,
as we hung for a breath above the terrible incline, did I feel a slight shudder. One of my
companions, who had never before been upon an animal's back, so fell in love with her "Sandy"
that she longed for a trunk big enough in which to take him home with her.

It was more than worth while to make the descent to traverse that Cambrian plateau, which from
the rim is seen to flow out from the base of the enormous cliffs to the brink of the inner
chasm, looking like some soft, lavender-colored carpet or rug. I had never seen the Cambrian
rocks, the lowest of the stratified formations, nor set my foot upon Cambrian soil. Hence a
new experience was promised me. Rocky layers probably two or three miles thick had been worn
away from the old Cambrian foundations, and when I looked down upon that gently undulating
plateau, the thought of the eternity of time which it represented tended quite as much to make
me dizzy as did the drop of nearly four thousand feet. We found it gravelly and desert-like,
covered with cacti, low sagebrush, and other growths. The dim trail led us to its edge, where
we could look down into the twelve-hundred-foot V-shaped gash which the river had cut into
the dark, crude-looking Archaean rock. How distinctly it looked like a new day in creation
where the horizontal, yellowish-gray beds of the Cambrian were laid down upon the dark, amorphous,
and twisted older granite! How carefully the level strata had been fitted to the shapeless
mass beneath it! It all looked like the work of a master mason; apparently you could put the
point of your knife where one ended and the other began. The older rock suggested chaos and
turmoil; the other suggested order and plan, as if the builder had said, "Now upon this foundation
we will build our house." It is an interesting fact, the full geologic significance of which
I suppose I do not appreciate, that the different formations are usually marked off from one
another in just this sharp way, as if each one was, indeed, the work of a separate day of creation.
Nature appears at long intervals to turn over a new leaf and start a new chapter in her great
book. The transition from one geologic age to another appears to be abrupt: new colors, new
constituents, new qualities appear in the rocks with a suddenness hard to reconcile with Lyell's
doctrine of uniformitarianism, just as new species appear in the life of the globe with an
abruptness hard to reconcile with Darwin's slow process of natural selection. Is sudden mutation,
after all, the key to all these phenomena?

We ate our lunch on the old Cambrian table, placed there for us so long ago, and gazed down
upon the turbulent river hiding and reappearing in its labyrinthian channel so far below us.
It is worth while to make the descent in order to look upon the river which has been the chief
quarryman in excavating the canon, and to find how inadequate it looks for the work ascribed
to it. Viewed from where we sat, I judged it to be forty or fifty feet broad, but I was assured
that it was between two and three hundred feet. Water and sand are ever symbols of instability
and inconstancy, but let them work together, and they saw through mountains, and undermine
the foundations of the hills.

It is always worth while to sit or kneel at the feet of grandeur, to look up into the placid
faces of the earth gods and feel their power, and the tourist who goes down into the canon
certainly has this privilege. We did not bring back in our hands, or in our hats, the glory
that had lured us from the top, but we seemed to have been nearer its sources, and to have
brought back a deepened sense of the magnitude of the forms, and of the depth of the chasm
which we had heretofore gazed upon from a distance. Also we had plucked the flower of safety
from the nettle danger, always an exhilarating enterprise.

In climbing back, my eye, now sharpened by my geologic reading, dwelt frequently and long upon
the horizon where that cross-bedded Carboniferous sandstone joins the Carboniferous limestone
above it. How much older the sandstone looked! I could not avoid the impression that its surface
must have formed a plane of erosion ages and ages before the limestone had been laid down upon it.

We had left plenty of ice and snow at the top, but in the bottom we found the early spring
flowers blooming, and a settler at what is called the Indian Gardens was planting his garden.
Here I heard the song of the canon wren, a new and very pleasing bird-song to me. I think our
dreams were somewhat disturbed that night by the impressions of the day, but our day-dreams
since that time have at least been sweeter and more comforting, and I am sure that the remainder
of our lives will be the richer for our having seen the Grand Canon.

THE SPELL OF THE YOSEMITE

I

Yosemite won my heart at once, as it seems to win the hearts of all who visit it. In my case
many things helped to do it, but I am sure a robin, the first I had seen since leaving home,
did his part. He struck the right note, he brought the scene home to me, he supplied the link
of association. There he was, running over the grass or perching on the fence, or singing from
a tree-top in the old familiar way. Where the robin is at home, there at home am I. But many
other things helped to win my heart to the Yosemite--the whole character of the scene, not
only its beauty and sublimity, but the air of peace and protection, and of homelike seclusion
that pervades it; the charm of a nook, a retreat, combined with the power and grandeur of nature
in her sternest moods.

After passing from the hotel at El Portal along the foaming and roaring Merced River, and amid
the tumbled confusion of enormous granite boulders shaken down from the cliffs above, you cross
the threshold of the great valley as into some vast house or hall carved out of the mountains,
and at once feel the spell of the brooding calm and sheltered seclusion that pervades it. You
pass suddenly from the tumultuous, the chaotic, into the ordered, the tranquil, the restful,
which seems enhanced by the power and grandeur that encompass them about. You can hardly be
prepared for the hush that suddenly falls upon the river and for the gentle rural and sylvan
character of much that surrounds you; the peace of the fields, the seclusion of the woods,
the privacy of sunny glades, the enchantment of falls and lucid waters, with a touch of human
occupancy here and there--all this, set in that enormous granite frame, three or four thousand
feet high, ornamented with domes and spires and peaks still higher,--it is all this that wins
your heart and fills your imagination in the Yosemite.

As you ride or walk along the winding road up the level valley amid the noble pines and spruces
and oaks, and past the groves and bits of meadow and the camps of many tents, and the huge
mossy granite boulders here and there reposing in the shade of the trees, with the full, clear,
silent river winding through the plain near you, you are all the time aware of those huge vertical
walls, their faces scarred and niched, streaked with color, or glistening with moisture, and
animated with waterfalls, rising up on either hand, thousands of feet high, not architectural,
or like something builded, but like the sides and the four corners of the globe itself. What
an impression of mass and of power and of grandeur in repose filters into you as you walk along!
El Capitan stands there showing its simple sweeping lines through the trees as you approach,
like one of the veritable pillars of the firmament. How long we are nearing it and passing
it! It is so colossal that it seems near while it is yet far off. It is so simple that the
eye takes in its naked grandeur at a glance. It demands of you a new standard of size which
you cannot at once produce. It is as clean and smooth as the flank of a horse, and as poised
and calm as a Greek statue. It curves out toward the base as if planted there to resist the
pressure of worlds--probably the most majestic single granite column or mountain buttress on
the earth. Its summit is over three thousand feet above you. Across the valley, nearly opposite,
rise the Cathedral Rocks to nearly the same height, while farther along, beyond El Capitan,
the Three Brothers shoulder the sky at about the same dizzy height. Near the head of the great
valley, North Dome, perfect in outline as if turned in a lathe, and its brother, the Half Dome
(or shall we say half-brother?) across the valley, look down upon Mirror Lake from an altitude
of over four thousand feet. These domes suggest enormous granite bubbles if such were possible
pushed up from below and retaining their forms through the vast geologic ages. Of course they
must have weathered enormously, but as the rock seems to peel off in concentric sheets, their
forms are preserved.

II

One warm, bright Sunday near the end of April, six of us walked up from the hotel to Vernal
and Nevada Falls, or as near to them as we could get, and took our fill of the tumult of foaming
waters struggling with the wreck of huge granite cliffs: so impassive and immobile the rocks,
so impetuous and reckless and determined the onset of the waters, till the falls are reached,
when the obstructed river seems to find the escape and the freedom it was so eagerly seeking.
Better to be completely changed into foam and spray by one single leap of six hundred feet
into empty space, the river seems to say, than be forever baffled and tortured and torn on
this rack of merciless boulders.

We followed the zigzagging trail up the steep side of the valley, touching melting snow-banks
in its upper courses, passing huge granite rocks also melting in the slow heat of the geologic
ages, pausing to take in the rugged, shaggy spruces and pines that sentineled the mountain-sides
here and there, or resting our eyes upon Liberty Cap, which carries its suggestive form a thousand
feet or more above the Nevada Fall. What beauty, what grandeur attended us that day! the wild
tumult of waters, the snow-white falls, the motionless avalanches of granite rocks, and the
naked granite shaft, Liberty Cap, dominating all!

And that night, too, when we sat around a big camp-fire near our tents in the valley, and saw
the full moon come up and look down upon us from behind Sentinel Rock, and heard the intermittent
booming of Yosemite Falls sifting through the spruce trees that towered around us, and felt
the tender, brooding spirit of the great valley, itself touched to lyric intensity by the grandeurs
on every hand, steal in upon us, and possess our souls--surely that was a night none of us
can ever forget. As Yosemite can stand the broad, searching light of midday and not be cheapened,
so its enchantments can stand the light of the moon and the stars and not be rendered too vague
and impalpable.

Going from the Grand Canon to Yosemite is going from one sublimity to another of a different
order. The canon is the more strange, unearthly, apocryphal, appeals more to the imagination,
and is the more overwhelming in its size, its wealth of color, and its multitude of suggestive
forms. But for quiet majesty and beauty, with a touch of the sylvan and pastoral, too, Yosemite
stands alone. One could live with Yosemite, camp in it, tramp in it, winter and summer in it,
and find nature in her tender and human, almost domestic moods, as well as in her grand and
austere. But I do not think one could ever feel at home in or near the Grand Canon; it is too
unlike anything we have ever known upon the earth; it is like a vision of some strange colossal
city uncovered from the depth of geologic time. You may have come to it, as we did, from the
Petrified Forests, where you saw the silicified trunks of thousands of gigantic trees or tree
ferns, that grew millions of years ago, most of them uncovered, but many of them protruding
from banks of clay and gravel, and in their interiors rich in all the colors of the rainbow,
and you wonder if you may not now be gazing upon some petrified antediluvian city of temples
and holy places exhumed by mysterious hands and opened up to the vulgar gaze of to-day. You
look into it from above and from another world and you descend into it at your peril. Yosemite
you enter as into a gigantic hall and make your own; the canon you gaze down upon, and are
an alien, whether you enter it or not. Yosemite is carved out of the most majestic and enduring
of all rocks, granite; the Grand Canon is carved out of one of the most beautiful, but perishable,
red Carboniferous sandstone and limestone. There is a maze of beautiful and intricate lines
in the latter, a wilderness of temple-like forms and monumental remains, and noble architectural
profiles that delight while they bewilder the eye. Yosemite has much greater simplicity, and
is much nearer the classic standard of beauty. Its grand and austere features predominate,
of course, but underneath these and adorning them are many touches of the idyllic and the picturesque.
Its many waterfalls fluttering like white lace against its vertical granite walls, its smooth,
level floor, its noble pines and oaks, its open glades, its sheltering groves, its bright,
clear, winding river, its soft voice of many waters, its flowers, its birds, its grass, its
verdure, even its orchards of blooming apple trees, all inclosed in this tremendous granite
frame--what an unforgettable picture it all makes, what a blending of the sublime and the homelike
and familiar it all is! It is the waterfalls that make the granite alive, and bursting into
bloom as it were. What a touch they give! how they enliven the scene! What music they evoke
from these harps of stone!

The first leap of Yosemite Falls is sixteen hundred feet--sixteen hundred feet of a compact
mass of snowy rockets shooting downward and bursting into spray around which rainbows flit
and hover. The next leap is four hundred feet, and the last six hundred. We tried to get near
the foot and inspect the hidden recess in which this airy spirit again took on a more tangible
form of still, running water, but the spray over a large area fell like a summer shower, drenching
the trees and the rocks, and holding the inquisitive tourist off at a safe distance. We had
to beat a retreat with dripping garments before we had got within fifty yards of the foot of
the fall. At first I was surprised at the volume of water that came hurrying out of the hidden
recess of dripping rocks and trees--a swiftly flowing stream, thirty or forty feet wide, and
four or five feet deep. How could that comparatively narrow curtain of white spray up there
give birth to such a full robust stream? But I saw that in making the tremendous leap from
the top of the precipice, the stream was suddenly drawn out, as we stretch a rubber band in
our hands, and that the solid and massive current below was like the rubber again relaxed.
The strain was over, and the united waters deepened and slowed up over their rocky bed.

Yosemite for a home or a camp, the Grand Canon for a spectacle. I have spoken of the robin
I saw in Yosemite Valley. Think how forlorn and out of place a robin would seem in the Grand
Canon! What would he do there? There is no turf for him to inspect, and there are no trees
for him to perch on. I should as soon expect to find him amid the pyramids of Egypt, or amid
the ruins of Karnak. The bluebird was in the Yosemite also, and the water-ouzel haunted the
lucid waters.

I noticed a peculiarity of the oak in Yosemite that I never saw elsewhere [Footnote: I have
since observed the same trait in the oaks in Georgia--probably a characteristic of this tree
in southern latitudes.]--a fluid or outflowing condition of the growth aboveground, such as
one usually sees in the roots of trees--so that it tended to envelop and swallow, as it were,
any solid object with which it came in contact. If its trunk touched a point of rock, it would
put out great oaken lips several inches in extent as if to draw the rock into its maw. If a
dry limb was cut or broken off, a foot from the trunk, these thin oaken lips would slowly creep
out and envelop it--a sort of Western omnivorous trait appearing in the trees.

Whitman refers to "the slumbering and liquid trees." These Yosemite oaks recall his expression
more surely than any of our Eastern trees.

The reader may create for himself a good image of Yosemite by thinking of a section of seven
or eight miles of the Hudson River, midway of its course, as emptied of its water and deepened
three thousand feet or more, having the sides nearly vertical, with snow-white waterfalls fluttering
against them here and there, the famous spires and domes planted along the rim, and the landscape
of groves and glades, with its still, clear winding river, occupying the bottom.

IV

One cannot look upon Yosemite or walk beneath its towering walls without the question arising
in his mind, How did all this happen? What were the agents that brought it about? There has
been a great geologic drama enacted here; who or what were the star actors? There are two other
valleys in this part of the Sierra, Hetch-Hetchy and King's River, that are almost identical
in their main features, though the Merced Yosemite is the widest of the three. Each of them
is a tremendous chasm in the granite rock, with nearly vertical walls, domes, El Capitans,
and Sentinel and Cathedral Rocks, and waterfalls--all modeled on the same general plan. I believe
there is nothing just like this trio of Yosemites anywhere else on the globe.

Guided by one's ordinary sense or judgment alone, one's judgment as developed and disciplined
by the everyday affairs of life and the everyday course of nature, one would say on beholding
Yosemite that here is the work of exceptional and extraordinary agents or world-building forces.
It is as surprising and exceptional as would be a cathedral in a village street, or a gigantic
sequoia in a grove of our balsam firs. The approach to it up the Merced River does not prepare
one for any such astonishing spectacle as awaits one. The rushing, foaming water amid the tumbled
confusion of huge granite rocks and the open V-shaped valley, are nothing very remarkable or
unusual. Then suddenly you are on the threshold of this hall of the elder gods. Demons and
furies might lurk in the valley below, but here is the abode of the serene, beneficent Olympian
deities. All is so calm, so hushed, so friendly, yet so towering, so stupendous, so unspeakably
beautiful. You are in a mansion carved out of the granite foundations of the earth, with walls
two or three thousand feet high, hung here and there with snow-white waterfalls, and supporting
the blue sky on domes and pinnacles still higher. Oh, the calmness and majesty of the scene!
the evidence of such tremendous activity of some force, some agent, and now so tranquil, so
sheltering, so beneficent!

That there should be two or three Yosemites in the Sierra not very far apart, all with the
main features singularly alike, is very significant--as if this kind of valley was latent in
the granite of that region--some peculiarity of rock structure that lends itself readily to
these formations. The Sierra lies beyond the southern limit of the great continental ice-sheet
of late Tertiary times, but it nursed and reared many local glaciers, and to the eroding power
of these its Yosemites are partly due. But water was at work here long before the ice--eating
down into the granite and laying open the mountain for the ice to begin its work. Ice may come,
and ice may go, says the river, but I go on forever. Water tends to make a V-shaped valley,
ice a U-shaped one, though in the Hawaiian Islands, where water erosion alone has taken place,
the prevailing form of the valleys is that of the U-shaped. Yosemite approximates to this shape,
and ice has certainly played a part in its formation. But the glacier seems to have stopped
at the outlet of the great valley; it did not travel beyond the gigantic hall it had helped
to excavate. The valley of the Merced from the mouth of Yosemite downward is an open valley
strewn with huge angular granite rocks and shows no signs of glaciation whatever. The reason
of this abruptness is quite beyond my ken. It is to me a plausible theory that when the granite
that forms the Sierra was lifted or squeezed up by the shrinking of the earth, large fissures
and crevasses may have occurred, and that Yosemite and kindred valleys may be the result of
the action of water and ice in enlarging these original chasms. Little wonder that the earlier
geologists, such as Whitney, were led to attribute the exceptional character of these valleys
to exceptional and extraordinary agents--to sudden faulting or dislocation of the earth's crust.
But geologists are becoming more and more loath to call in the cataclysmal to explain any feature
of the topography of the land. Not to the thunder or the lightning, to earthquake or volcano,
to the forces of upheaval or dislocation, but to the still, small voice of the rain and the
winds, of the frost and the snow,--the gentle forces now and here active all about us, carving
the valleys and reducing the mountains, and changing the courses of rivers,--to these, as Lyell
taught us, we are to look in nine cases out of ten, yes, in ninety-nine out of a hundred, to
account for the configuration of the continents.

The geologists of our day, while not agreeing as to the amount of work done respectively by
ice and water, yet agree that to the latter the larger proportion of the excavation is to be
ascribed. At any rate between them both they have turned out one of the most beautiful and
stupendous pieces of mountain carving to be found upon the earth.

THROUGH THE EYES OF THE GEOLOGIST

I

How habitually we go about over the surface of the earth, delving it or cultivating it or leveling
it, without thinking that it has not always been as we now find it, that the mountains were
not always mountains, nor the valleys always valleys, nor the plains always plains, nor the
sand always sand, nor the clay always clay. Our experience goes but a little way in such matters.
Such a thought takes us from human time to God's time, from the horizon of place and years
to the horizon of geologic ages. We go about our little affairs in the world, sowing and reaping
and building and journeying, like children playing through the halls of their ancestors, without
pausing to ask how these things all came about. We do not reflect upon the age of our fields
any more than we do upon the size of the globe under our feet: when we become curious about
such matters and look upon the mountains as either old or young, or as the subjects of birth,
growth, and decay, then we are unconscious geologists. It is to our interest in such things
that geology appeals and it is this interest that it stimulates and guides.

What an astonishing revelation, for instance, that the soil was born of the rocks, and is still
born of the rocks; that every particle of it was once locked up in the primitive granite and
was unlocked by the slow action of the rain and the dews and the snows; that the rocky ribs
of the earth were clothed with this fertile soil out of which we came and to which we return
by their own decay; that the pulling-down of the inorganic meant the building-up of the organic;
that the death of the crystal meant the birth of the cell, and indirectly of you and me and
of all that lives upon the earth.

Had there been no soil, had the rocks not decayed, there had been no you and me. Such considerations
have long made me feel a keen interest in geology, and especially of late years have stimulated
my desire to try to see the earth as the geologist sees it. I have always had a good opinion
of the ground underfoot, out of which we all come, and to which we all return; and the story
the geologists tell us about it is calculated to enhance greatly that good opinion.

I think that if I could be persuaded, as my fathers were, that the world was made in six days,
by the fiat of a supernatural power, I should soon lose my interest in it. Such an account
of it takes it out of the realm of human interest, because it takes it out of the realm of
natural causation, and places it in the realm of the arbitrary, and non-natural. But to know
that it was not made at all, in the mechanical sense, but that it grew--that it is an evolution
as much as the life upon the surface, that it has an almost infinite past, that it has been
developing and ripening for millions upon millions of years, a veritable apple upon the great
sidereal tree, ameliorating from cycle to cycle, mellowing, coloring, sweetening--why, such
a revelation adds immensely to our interest in it.

As with nearly everything else, the wonder of the world grows the more we grasp its history.
The wonder of life grows the more we consider the chaos of fire and death out of which it came;
the wonder of man grows the more we peer into the abyss of geologic time and of low bestial
life out of which he came.

Not a tree, not a shrub, not a flower, not a green thing growing, not an insect of an hour,
but has a background of a vast aeon of geologic and astronomic time, out of which the forces
that shaped it have emerged, and over which the powers of chaos and darkness have failed to
prevail.

The modern geologist affords us one of the best illustrations of the uses of the scientific
imagination that we can turn to. The scientific imagination seems to be about the latest phase
of the evolution of the human mind. This power of interpretation of concrete facts, this Miltonic
flight into time and space, into the heavens above, and into the bowels of the earth beneath,
and bodying forth a veritable history, a warring of the powers of light and darkness, with
the triumph of the angels of light and life, makes Milton's picture seem hollow and unreal.
The creative and poetic imagination has undoubtedly already reached its high-water mark. We
shall probably never see the great imaginative works of the past surpassed or even equaled.
But in the world of scientific discovery and interpretation, we see the imagination working
in new fields and under new conditions, and achieving triumphs that mark a new epoch in the
history of the race. Nature, which once terrified man and made a coward of him, now inspires
him and fills him with love and enthusiasm.

The geologist is the interpreter of the records of the rocks. From a bit of strata here, and
a bit there, he re-creates the earth as it was in successive geologic periods, as Cuvier reconstructed
his extinct animals from fragments of their bones; and the same interpretative power of the
imagination is called into play in both cases, only the palaeontologist has a much narrower
field to work in, and the background of his re-creations must be supplied by the geologist.

Everything connected with the history of the earth is on such a vast scale--such a scale of
time, such a scale of power, such a scale of movement--that in trying to measure it by our
human standards and experience we are like the proverbial child with his cup on the seashore.
Looked at from our point of view, the great geological processes often seem engaged in world-destruction
rather than in world-building. Those oft-repeated invasions of the continents by the ocean,
which have gone on from Archaean times, and during which vast areas which had been dry land
for ages were engulfed, seem like world-wide catastrophes. And no doubt they were such to myriads
of plants and animals of those times. But this is the way the continents grew. All the forces
of the invading waters were engaged in making more land.

The geologist is bold; he is made so by the facts and processes with which he deals; his daring
affirmations are inspired by a study of the features of the earth about him; his time is not
our time, his horizons are not our horizons; he escapes from our human experiences and standards
into the vast out-of-doors of the geologic forces and geologic ages. The text he deciphers
is written large, written across the face of the continent, written in mountain-chains and
ocean depths, and in the piled strata of the globe. We untrained observers cannot spell out
these texts, because they are written large; our vision is adjusted to smaller print; we are
like the school-boy who finds on the map the name of a town or a river, but does not see the
name of the state or the continent printed across it. If the geologist did not tell us, how
should we ever suspect that probably where we now stand two or more miles of strata have been
worn away by the winds and rains; that the soil of our garden, our farm, represents the ashes
of mountains burned up in the slow fires of the geologic ages.

Geology first gives us an adequate conception of time. The limitations which shut our fathers
into the narrow close of six thousand years are taken down by this great science and we are
turned out into the open of unnumbered millions of years. Upon the background of geologic time
our chronological time shows no more than a speck upon the sky. The whole of human history
is but a mere fraction of a degree of this mighty arc. The Christian era would make but a few
seconds of the vast cycle of the earth's history. Geologic time! The words seem to ring down
through the rocky strata of the earth's crust; they reverberate under the mountains, and make
them rise and fall like the waves of the sea; they open up vistas through which we behold the
continents and the oceans changing places, and the climates of the globe shifting like clouds
in the sky; whole races and tribes of animal forms disappear and new ones come upon the scene.
Such a past! the imagination can barely skirt the edge of it. As the pool in the field is to
the sea that wraps the earth, so is the time of our histories to the cycle of ages in which
the geologist reckons the events of the earth's history.

Through the eyes of the geologist one may look upon his native hills and see them as they were
incalculable ages ago, and as they probably will be incalculable ages ahead; those hills, so
unchanging during his lifetime, and during a thousand lifetimes, he may see as flitting as
the cloud shadows upon the landscape. Out of the dark abyss of geologic time there come stalking
the ghosts of lost mountains and lost hills and valleys and plains, or lost rivers and lakes,
yea, of lost continents; we see a procession of the phantoms of strange and monstrous beasts,
many of them colossal in size and fearful in form, and among the minor forms of this fearful
troop of spectres we see the ones that carried safely forward, through the vicissitudes of
those ages, the precious impulse that was to eventuate in the human race.

Only the geologist knows the part played by erosion in shaping the earth's surface as we see
it. He sees, I repeat, the phantoms of vanished hills and mountains all about us. He sees their
shadow forms wherever he looks. He follows out the lines of the flexed or folded strata where
they come to the surface, and thus sketches in the air the elevation that has disappeared.
In some places he finds that the valleys have become hills and the hills have become valleys,
or that the anticlines and synclines, as he calls them, have changed places--as a result of
the unequal hardness of the rocks. Over all the older parts of the country the original features
have been so changed by erosion that, could they be suddenly restored, one would be lost on
his home farm. The rocks have melted into soil, as the snow-banks in spring melt into water.
The rocks that remain are like fragments of snow or ice that have so far withstood the weather.
Geologists tell us that the great Appalachian chain has been in the course of the ages reduced
almost to a base level or peneplain, and then reelevated and its hills and mountains carved
out anew.

We change the surface of the earth a little with our engineering, drain a marsh, level a hill,
sweep away a forest, or bore a mountain, but what are these compared with the changes that
have gone on there before our race was heard of? In my native mountains, the Catskills, all
those peaceful pastoral valleys, with their farms and homesteads, lie two or three thousand
feet below the original surface of the land. Could the land be restored again to its first
condition in Devonian times, probably the fields where I hoed corn and potatoes as a boy would
be buried one or two miles beneath the rocks.

The Catskills are residual mountains, or what Agassiz calls "denudation mountains." When we
look at them with the eye of the geologist we see the great plateau of tableland of Devonian
times out of which they were carved by the slow action of the sub-aerial forces. They are like
the little ridges and mounds of soil that remain of your garden-patch after the waters of a
cloudburst have swept over it. They are immeasurably old, but they do not look it, except to
the eye of the geologist. There is nothing decrepit in their appearance, nothing broken, or
angular, or gaunt, or rawboned. Their long, easy, flowing lines, their broad, smooth backs,
their deep, wide, gently sloping valleys, all help to give them a look of repose and serenity,
as if the fret and fever of life were long since passed with them. Compared with the newer
mountains of uplift in the West, they are like cattle lying down and ruminating in the field
beside alert wild steers with rigid limbs and tossing horns. They sleep and dream with bowed
heads upon the landscape. Their great flanks and backs are covered with a deep soil that nourishes
a very even growth of beech, birch, and maple forests. Though so old, their tranquillity never
seems to have been disturbed; no storm-and-stress period has left its mark upon them. Their
strata all lie horizontal just as they were laid down in the old seas, and nothing but the
slow gentle passage of the hand of time shows in their contours. Mountains of peace and repose,
hills and valleys with the flowing lines of youth, coming down to us from the fore- world of
Palaeozoic time, yet only rounded and mellowed by the aeons they have passed through. Old,
oh, so old, but young with verdure and limpid streams, and the pastoral spirit of to-day!

To the geologist most mountains are short-lived. When he finds great sturdy ranges, like the
Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, he knows they are young,--mere boys. When they get old, they
will be cut down, and their pride and glory gone. A few more of these geologic years and they
will be reduced to a peneplain,--only their stumps left. This seems to hold truer of mountains
that are wrinkles in the earth's crust--squeezed up and crumpled stratified rock, such as most
of the great mountain-systems are--than of mountains of erosion like the Catskills, or of upheaval
like the Adirondacks. The crushed and folded and dislocated strata are laid open to the weather
as the horizontal strata, and as the upheaved masses of Archaean rock are not. Moreover, strata
of unequal hardness are exposed, and this condition favors rapid erosion.

In imagination the geologist is present at the birth of whole mountain-ranges. He sees them
gestating in the womb of their mother, the sea. Where our great Appalachian range now stands,
he sees, in the great interior sea of Palaeozoic time, what he calls a "geosyncline," a vast
trough, or cradle, being slowly filled with sediment brought down by the rivers from the adjoining
shores. These sediments accumulate to the enormous depth of twenty-five thousand feet, and
harden into rock. Then in the course of time they are squeezed together and forced up by the
contraction of the earth's crust, and thus the Appalachians are born. When Mother Earth takes
a new hitch in her belt, her rocky garment takes on new wrinkles. Just why the earth's crust
should wrinkle along lines of rock of such enormous thickness is not a little puzzling. But
we are told it is because this heavy mass of sediment presses the sea-bottom down till the
rocks are fused by the internal heat of the earth and thus a line of weakness is established.
In any case the earth's forces act as a whole, and the earth's crust at the thickest points
is so comparatively thin--probably not much more than a heavy sheet of cardboard over a six-inch
globe--that these forces seem to go their own way regardless of such minor differences.

The Alps and the Himalayas, much younger than our Appalachians, were also begotten and nursed
in the cradle of a vast geosyncline in the Tertiary seas. We speak of the birth of a mountain-range
in terms of a common human occurrence, or as if it were an event that might be witnessed, measurable
in human years or days, whereas it is an event measurable only in geologic periods, and geologic
periods are marked off only on the dial-face of eternity. The old Hebrew writer gave but a
faint image of it when he said that with the Lord a thousand years are as one day; it is hardly
one hour of the slow beat of that clock whose hours mark the periods of the earth's development.

The whole long period during which the race of man has been rushing about, tickling and scratching
and gashing the surface of the globe, would make but a small fraction of one of the days that
make up the periods with which the geologist deals. And the span of human life, how it dwindles
to a point in the face of the records of the rocks! Doubtless the birth of some of the mountain-systems
of the globe is still going on, and we suspect it not; an elevation of one foot in a century
would lift up the Sierra or the Rocky Mountains in a comparatively short geologic period.

But some hills flow much faster than others. Hills made up of the latest or newest formations
seem to take to themselves wings the fastest.

The Archaean hills and mountains, how slowly they melt away! In the Adirondacks, in northern
New England, in the Highlands of the Hudson, they still hold their heads high and have something
of the vigor of their prime.

The most enduring rocks are the oldest; and the most perishable are, as a rule, the youngest.
It takes time to season and harden the rocks, as it does men. Then the earlier rocks seem to
have had better stuff in them. They are nearer the paternal granite; and the primordial seas
that mothered them were, no doubt, richer in the various mineral solutions that knitted and
compacted the sedimentary deposits. The Cretaceous formations melt away almost like snow. I
fancy that the ocean now, compared with the earlier condition when it must have been so saturated
with mineral elements, is like thrice-skimmed milk.

The geologist is not stinted for time. He deals with big figures. It is refreshing to see him
dealing out his years so liberally. Do you want a million or two to account for this or that?
You shall have it for the asking. He has an enormous balance in the bank of Time, and he draws
upon it to suit his purpose. In human history a thousand years is a long time. Ten thousand
years wipe out human history completely. Ten thousand more, and we are probably among the rude
cave-men or river-drift men. One hundred thousand, and we are--where? Probably among the simian
ancestors of man. A million years, and we are probably in Eocene or Miocene times, among the
huge and often grotesque mammals, and our ancestor, a little creature, probably of the marsupial
kind, is skulking about and hiding from the great carnivorous beasts that would devour him.

I fancy Emerson would be surprised and probably displeased at the use I have made of his lines.
I remember once hearing him say that his teacher in such matters as I am here touching upon
was Agassiz, and not Darwin. Yet did he not write that audacious line about "the worm striving
to be man"? And Nature certainly took his "little man" by the hand and led him forward, and
on the morrow the rest of the animal creation "wore another face."

III

In my geological studies I have had a good deal of trouble with the sedimentary rocks, trying
to trace their genealogy and getting them properly fathered and mothered. I do not think the
geologists fully appreciate what a difficult problem the origin of these rocks presents to
the lay mind. They bulk so large, while the mass of original crystalline rocks from which they
are supposed to have been derived is so small in comparison. In the case of our own continent
we have, to begin with, about two million of square miles of Archaean rocks in detached lines
and masses, rising here and there above the primordial ocean; a large triangular mass in Canada,
and two broken lines of smaller masses running south from it on each side of the continent,
inclosing a vast interior sea between them. To end with, we have the finished continent of
eight million or more square miles, of an average height of two thousand feet above the sea,
built up or developed from and around these granite centres very much as the body is built
up and around the bones, and of such prodigious weight that some of our later geologists seek
to account for the continental submarine shelf that surrounds the continent on the theory that
the land has slowly crept out into the sea under the pressure of its own weight. And all this,--to
say nothing of the vast amount of rock, in some places a mile or two in thickness, that has
been eroded from the land surfaces of the globe in later geological time, and now lies buried
in the seas and lakes,--we are told, is the contribution of those detached portions of Archaean
rock that first rose above the primordial seas. It is a greater miracle than that of the loaves
and the fishes. We have vastly more to end with than we had to begin with. The more the rocks
have been destroyed, the more they have increased; the more the waters have devoured them,
the more they have multiplied and waxed strong.

Either the geologists have greatly underestimated the amount of Archaean rock above the waters
at the start, or else there are factors in the problem that have not been taken into the account.
Lyell seems to have appreciated the difficulties of the problem, and, to account for the forty
thousand feet of sediment deposited in Palaeozoic times in the region of the Appalachians,
he presupposes a neighboring continent to the east, probably formed of Laurentian rocks, where
now rolls the Atlantic. But if such a continent once existed, would not some vestige of it
still remain? The fact that no trace of it as been found, it seems to me, invalidates Lyell's
theory.

Archaean time in geologic history answers to pre-historic time in human history; all is dark
and uncertain, though we are probably safe in assuming that there was more strife and turmoil
among the earth-building forces than there has ever been since. The body of unstratified rock
within the limits of North America may have been much greater than is supposed, but it seems
to me impossible that it could have been anything like as massive as the continent now is.
If this had been the case there would have been no great interior sea, and no wide sea-margins
in which the sediments of the stratified rocks could have been deposited. More than four fifths
of the continent is of secondary origin and shows that vast geologic eras went to the making of it.

It is equally hard to believe that the primary or igneous rocks, where they did appear, were
sufficiently elevated to have furnished through erosion the all but incalculable amount of
material that went to the making of our vast land areas. But the geologists give me the impression
that this is what we are to believe.

Chamberlin and Salisbury, in their recent college geology, teach that each new formation implies
the destruction of an equivalent amount of older rock--every system being entirely built up
out of the older one beneath it. Lyell and Dana teach the same thing. If this were true, could
there have been any continental growth at all? Could a city grow by the process of pulling
down the old buildings for material to build the new? If the geology is correct, I fail to
see how there would be any more land surface to-day then there was in Archaean times. Each
new formation would only have replaced the old from which it came. The Silurian would only
have made good the waste of the Cambrian, and the Devonian made good the waste of the Silurian,
and so on to the top of the series, and in the end we should still have been at the foot of
the stairs. That vast interior sea that in Archaean times stretched from the rudimentary Appalachian
Mountains to the rudimentary Rocky Mountains, and which is now the heart of the continent,
would still have been a part of the primordial ocean. But instead of that, this sea is filled
and piled up with sedimentary rocks thousands of feet thick, that have given birth on their
surfaces to thousands of square miles of as fertile soil as the earth holds.

That the original crystalline rocks played the major part in the genealogy of the subsequent
stratified rocks, it would be folly to deny. But it seems to me that chemical and cosmic processes,
working through the air and the water, have contributed more than they have been credited with.

It looks as if in all cases when the soil is carried to the seabottom as sediment, and again,
during the course of ages, consolidated into rocks, the rocks thus formed have exceeded in
bulk the rocks that gave them birth. Something analogous to vital growth takes place. It seems
as if the original granite centres set the world-building forces at work. They served as nuclei
around which the materials gathered. These rocks bred other rocks, and these still others,
and yet others, till the framework of the land was fairly established. They were like the pioneer
settlers who plant homes here and there in the wilderness, and then in due time all the land
is peopled.

The granite is the Adam rock, and through a long line of descent the major part of all the
other rocks directly or indirectly may be traced. Thus the granite begot the Algonquin, the
Algonquin begot the Cambrian, the Cambrian begot the Silurian, the Silurian begot the Devonian,
and so on up through the Carboniferous, the Permian, the Mesozoic rocks, the Tertiary rocks,
to the latest Quaternary deposit.

But the curious thing about it all is the enormous progeny from so small a beginning; the rocks
seem really to have grown and multiplied like organic beings; the seed of the granite seems
to have fertilized the whole world of waters, and in due time they brought forth this huge
family of stratified rocks. There stands the Archaean Adam, his head and chest in Canada, his
two unequal legs running, one down the Pacific coast, and one down the Atlantic Coast, and
from his loins, we are told, all the progeny of rocks and soils that make up the continent
have sprung, one generation succeeding another in regular order. His latest offspring is in
the South and Southwest, and in the interior. These are the new countries, geologically speaking,
as well as humanly speaking.

The great interior sea, epicontinental, the geologists call it, seems to have been fermenting
and laboring for untold aeons in building up these parts of the continent. In the older Eastern
States we find the sons and grandsons of the old Adam granite; but in the South and West we
find his offspring of the twentieth or twenty-fifth generation, and so unlike their forebears;
the Permian rocks, for instance, and the Cretaceous rocks, are soft and unenduring, for the
most part. The later slates, too, are degenerates, and much of the sandstones have the hearts
of prodigals. In the Bad Lands of Arizona I could have cut my way into some of the Eocene formations
with my pocket-knife. Apparently the farther away we get from the parent granite, the more
easily is the rock eroded. Nearly all the wonderful and beautiful sculpturing of the rocks
in the West and Southwest is in rocks of comparatively recent date.

Can we say that all the organic matter of our time is from preexisting organic matter? one
organism torn down to build up another? that the beginning of the series was as great as the
end? There may have been as much matter in a state of vital organization in Carboniferous or
in Cretaceous times as in our own, but there is certainly more now than in early Palaeozoic
times. Yet every grain of this matter has existed somewhere in some form for all time. Or we
might ask if all the wealth of our day is from preexisting wealth--one fortune pulled down
to build up another,--too often the case, it is true,--thus passing the accumulated wealth
along from one generation to another. On the contrary, has there not been a steady gain of
that we call wealth through the ingenuity and the industry of man directed towards the latent
wealth of the earth? In a parallel manner has there been a gain in the bulk of the secondary
rocks through the action of the world-building forces directed to the sea, the air, and the
preexisting rocks. Had there been no gain, the fact would suggest the ill luck of a man investing
his capital in business and turning it over and over, and having no more money at the end than
he had in the beginning.

Nothing is in the sedimentary rock that was not at one time in the original granite, or in
the primordial seas, or in the primordial atmosphere, or in the heavens above, or in the interior
of the earth beneath. We must sweep the heavens, strain the seas, and leach the air, to obtain
all this material. Evidently the growth of these rocks has been mainly a chemical process--a
chemical organization of preexisting material, as much so as the growth of a plant or a tree
or an animal. The color and texture and volume of each formation differ so radically from those
of the one immediately before it as to suggest something more than a mere mechanical derivation
of one from the other. New factors, new sources, are implied. Above all have chemical processes
produced changes. This constant passage of the mineral elements of the rocks through the cycle
of erosion, sedimentation, and reinduration has exposed them to the action of the air, the
light, the sea, and has thus undoubtedly brought about a steady growth in their volume and
a constant change in their color and texture. Marl and clay and green sand and salt and gypsum
and shale, all have their genesis, all came down to us in some way or in some degree, from
the aboriginal crystalline rocks; but what transformations and transmutations they have undergone!
They have passed through Nature's laboratory and taken on new forms and characteristics.

"All sediments deposited in the sea," says my geology, "undergo more or less chemical change,"
and many chemical changes involve notable changes in volume of the mineral matter concerned.
It has been estimated that the conversion of granite rock into soil increases its volume eighty-eight
per cent, largely as the result of hydration, or the taking up of water in the chemical union.
The processes of oxidation and carbonation are also expansive processes. Whether any of this
gain in volume is lost in the process of sedimentation and reconsolidation, I do not know.
Probably all the elements that water takes from the rocks by solution, it returns to them when
the disintegrated parts, in the form of sediment in the sea, is again converted into strata.
It is in this cycle of rock disintegration and rock re-formation that the processes of life
go on. Without the decay of the rock there could be no life on the land. Water and air are
always the go-betweens of the organic and inorganic. After the rains have depleted the rocks
of their soluble parts and carried them to the sea, they come back and aid vegetable life to
unlock and appropriate other soluble parts, and thus build up the vegetable and, indirectly,
the animal world.

That the growth of the continents owes much to the denudation of the sea-bottom, brought about
by the tides and the ocean-currents, which were probably much more powerful in early than in
late geologic times, and to submarine mineral springs and volcanic eruptions of ashes and mud,
admits of little doubt. That it owes much to extra-terrestrial sources--to meteorites and meteoric
dust--also admits of little doubt.

It seems reasonable that earlier in the history of the evolution of our solar system there
should have been much more meteoric matter drifting through the interplanetary spaces than
during the later ages, and that a large amount of this matter should have found its way to
the earth, in the form either of solids or of gases. Probably much more material has been contributed
by volcanic eruptions than there is any evidence of apparent. The amount of mineral matter
held in solution by the primordial seas must have been enormous. The amount of rock laid down
in Palaeozoic times is estimated at fifty thousand feet, and of this thirteen thousand feet
were limestone; while the amount laid down in Mesozoic times, for aught we know a period quite
as long, amounts to eight thousand feet, indicating, it seems to me, that the deposition of
sediment went on much more rapidly in early geologic times. We are nearer the beginning of
things. All chemical processes in the earth's crust were probably more rapid. Doubtless the
rainfall was more, but the land areas must have been less. The greater amount of carbon dioxide
in the air during Palaeozoic times would have favored more rapid carbonation. When granite
is dissolved by weathering, carbon unites with the potash, the soda, the lime, the magnesia,
and the iron, and turns them into carbonates and swells their bulk. The one thing that is passed
along from formation to formation unchanged is the quartz sand. Quartz is tough, and the sand
we find to-day is practically the same that was dissolved out of the first crystalline rocks.

Take out of the soil and out of the rocks all that they owe to the air,--the oxygen and the
carbon,--and how would they dwindle! The limestone rocks would practically disappear.

Probably not less that one fourth of all the sedimentary rocks are limestone, which is of animal
origin. How much of the lime of which these rocks were built was leached out of the land-areas,
and how much was held in solution by the original sea-water, is of course a question. But all
the carbon they hold came out of the air. The waters of the primordial ocean were probably
highly charged with mineral matter, with various chlorides and sulphates and carbonates, such
as the sulphate of soda, the sulphate of lime, the sulphate of magnesia, the chloride of sodium,
and the like. The chloride of sodium, or salt, remains, while most of the other compounds have
been precipitated through the agency of minute forms of life, and now form parts of the soil
and of the stratified rocks beneath it.

If the original granite is the father of the rocks, the sea is the mother. In her womb they
were gestated and formed. Had not this seesaw of land and ocean taken place, there could have
been no continental growth. Every time the land took a bath in the sea, it came up enriched
and augmented. Each new layer of rocky strata taken on showed a marked change in color and
texture. It was a kind of evolution from that which preceded it. Whether the land always went
down, or whether the sea at times came up, by reason of some disturbance of the ocean floors
in its abysmal depths, we have no means of knowing. In any case, most of the land has taken
a sea bath many times, not all taking the plunge at the same time, but different parts going
down in successive geologic ages. The original granite upheavals in British America, and in
New York and New England, seem never to have taken this plunge, except an area about Lake Superior
which geologists say has gone down four or five times. The Laurentian and Adirondack ranges
have never been in pickle in the sea since they first saw the light. In most other parts of
the continent, the seesaw between the sea and the land has gone on steadily from the first,
and has been the chief means of the upbuilding of the land.

To the slow and oft-repeated labor-throes of the sea we owe the continents. But the sea devours
her children. Large areas, probably continental in extent, have gone down and have not yet
come up, if they ever will. The great Mississippi Valley was under water and above water time
after time during the Palaeozoic period. The last great invasion of the land by the sea, and
probably the greatest of all, seems to have been in Cretaceous times, at the end of the Mesozoic
period. There were many minor invasions during Tertiary times, but none on so large a scale
as this Cretaceous invasion. At this time a large part of North and South America, and of Europe,
and parts of Asia and Australia went under the ocean. It was as if the earth had exhaled her
breath and let her abdomen fall. The sea united the Gulf of Mexico with the Arctic Ocean, and
covered the Prairie and the Gulf States and came up over New Jersey to the foot of the Archaean
Highlands. This great marine inundation probably took place several million years ago. It was
this visitation of the sea that added the vast chalk beds to England and France. In parts of
this country limestone beds five or six thousand feet thick were laid down, as well as extensive
chalk beds. The earth seems to have taken another hitch in her girdle during this era. As the
land went down, the mountains came up. Most of the great Western mountain-chains were formed
during this movement, and the mountains of Mexico were pushed up. The Alps were still under
the sea, but the Sierra and the Alleghanies were again lifted.

It is very interesting to me to know that in Colorado charred wood, and even charcoal, have
been found in Cretaceous deposits. The fact seems to give a human touch to that long-gone time.
It was, of course, long ages before the evolution of man, as man, had taken place, yet such
is the power of association, that those charred sticks instantly call him to mind, as if we
had come upon the place of his last campfire. At any rate, it is something to know that man,
when he did come, did not have to discover or invent fire, but that this element, which has
played such a large part in his development and civilization, was here before him, waiting,
like so many other things in nature, to be his servant and friend. As Vulcan was everywhere
rampant during this age, throwing out enough lava in India alone to put a lava blanket four
or five feet thick over the whole surface of the globe, it was probably this fire that charred
the wood. It would be interesting to know if these enormous lava-flows always followed the
subsidence of some part of the earth's crust. In Cretaceous times both the subsidence and the
lava- flows seem to have been worldwide.

IV

We seem to think that the earth has sown all her wild oats, that her riotous youth is far behind
her, and that she is now passing into a serene old age. Had we lived during any of the great
periods of the past, we might have had the same impression, so tranquil, for the most part,
has been the earth's history, so slow and rhythmical have been the beats of the great clock
of time. We see this in the homogeneity of the stratified rocks, layer upon layer for thousands
of feet as uniform in texture and quality as the goods a modern factory turns out, every yard
of it like every other yard. No hitch or break anywhere. The bedding-planes of many kinds of
rock occur at as regular intervals as if they had been determined by some kind of machinery.
Here, on the formation where I live, there are alternate layers of slate and sandstone, three
or four inches thick, for thousands of feet in extent; they succeed each other as regularly
as the bricks and mortar in a brick wall, and are quite as homogeneous. What does this mean
but that for an incalculable period the processes of erosion and deposition went on as tranquilly
as a summer day? There was no strike among the workmen, and no change in the plan of the building,
or in the material.

The Silurian limestone, the old red sandstone, the Hamilton flag, the Oneida conglomerate,
where I have known them, are as homogeneous as a snowbank, or as the ice on a mountain lake;
grain upon grain, all from the same source in each case, and sifted and sorted by the same
agents, and the finished product as uniform in color and quality as the output of some great mill.

Then, after a vast interval, there comes a break: something like an end and a new beginning,
as if one day of creation were finished and a new one begun. The different formations lie unconformably
upon each other, which means revolution of some sort. There has been a strike or a riot in
the great mill, or it has lain idle for a long period, and when it has resumed, a different
product is the result. Something happened between each two layers. What?

Though in remote geological ages the earth-building and earth-shaping forces were undoubtedly
more active than they are now, and periods of deformation and upheaval were more frequent,
yet had we lived in any of those periods we should probably have found the course of nature,
certainly when measured by human generations, as even and tranquil as we find it to-day. The
great movements are so slow and gentle, for the most part, that we should not have been aware
of them had we been on the spot. Once in a million or a half-million years there may have been
terrific earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, such as seem to have taken place in Tertiary time,
and at the end of the Palaeozoic period. Yet the vast stretches of time between were evidently
times of tranquillity.

It is probable that the great glacial winter of Pleistocene times came on as gradually as our
own winter, or through a long period of slowly falling temperature, and as it seems to have
been many hundred thousand times as long, this preceding period, or great fall, was probably
equally long--so long that the whole of recorded human history would form but a small fraction
of it. It may easily be, I think, that we are now living in the spring of the great cycle of
geologic seasons. The great ice-sheet has withdrawn into the Far North like snowbanks that
linger in our wood in late spring, where it still covers Greenland as it once covered this
country. When the season of summer is reached, some hundreds of thousands of years hence, it
may be that tropical life, both animal and vegetable, will again flourish on the shores of
the Arctic Ocean, as it did in Tertiary times. And all this change will come about so quietly
and so slowly that nobody will suspect it.

That the crust of the earth is becoming more and more stable seems a natural conclusion, but
that all folding and shearing and disruption of the strata are at an end, is a conclusion we
cannot reach in the face of the theory that the earth is shrinking as it cools.

The earth cools and contracts with almost infinite slowness, and the great crustal changes
that take place go on, for the most part, so quietly and gently that we should not suspect
them were we present on the spot, and long generations would not suspect them. Elevations have
taken place across the beds of rivers without deflecting the course of the river; the process
was so slow that the river sawed down through the rock as fast as it came up. Nearly all the
great cosmic and terrestrial changes and revolutions are veiled from us by this immeasurable
lapse of time.

Any prediction about the permanence of the land as we know it, or as the race has known it,
or of our immunity from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, or of a change of climate, or of
any cosmic catastrophe, based on human experience, is vain and worthless. What is or has been
in man's time is no criterion as to what will be in God's time. The periods of great upheaval
and deformation in the earth's crust appear to be separated by millions of years. Away back
in pre-Cambrian times, there appear to have been immense periods during which the peace and
repose of the globe were as profound as in our own time. Then at the end of Palaeozoic time--how
many millions of years is only conjectural--the truce of aeons was broken, and the dogs of
war let loose; it was a period of revolution which resulted in the making of one of our greatest
mountain-systems, the Appalachian, and in an unprecedented extinction of species. Later eras
have witnessed similar revolutions. Why may they not come again? The shrinking of the cooling
globe must still go on, and this shrinking must give rise to surface disturbances and dislocations,
maybe in the uplift of new mountain-ranges from the sea-bottom, now undreamed of, and in volcanic
eruptions as great as any in the past. Such a shrinkage and eruption made the Hawaiian Islands,
probably in Tertiary times; such a shrinkage may make other islands and other continents before
another period of equal time has elapsed.

Of course the periods and eras into which the geologists divide geologic time are as arbitrary
as the months and seasons into which we divide our year, and they fade out into each other
in much the same way; but they are really as marked as our seasonal divisions. Not in their
climates--for the climate of the globe seems to have been uniformly warm from pole to pole,
without climatic zones, throughout the vast stretch of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times--but in
the succession of animal and vegetable life which they show. The rocks are the cemeteries of
the different forms of life that have appeared upon the globe, and here the geologist reads
their succession in time, and assigns them to his geologic horizons accordingly. The same or
allied forms appeared upon all parts of the earth at approximately the same time, so that he
can trace his different formations around the world by the fossils they hold. Each period had
its dominant forms. The Silurian was the great age of trilobites; the Devonian, the age of
fishes; Mesozoic times swarm with the gigantic reptiles; and in Tertiary times the mammals
are dominant. Each period and era has its root in that which preceded it. There were rude,
half-defined fishes in the Silurian, and probably the beginning of amphibians in the Devonian,
and some small mammalian forms in the Mesozoic time, and doubtless rude studies of the genus
Homo in Tertiary times. Nature works up her higher forms Jike a human inventor from rude beginnings.
Her first models barely suggest her later achievements.

In the vegetable world it has been the same; from the first simple algae in the Cambrian seas
up to the forests of our own times, the gradation is easily traced. Step by step has vegetable
life mounted. The great majority of the plants and animals of one period fail to pass over
into the next, just as our spring flowers fail to pass over into summer, and our summer flowers
into fall. But the law of evolution is at work, and life always rises on stepping-stones of
its dead self to higher things.

V

HOLIDAYS IN HAWAII

I

On the edge of the world my islands lie," sings Mrs. Frear in her little lyric on the Hawaiian
Islands.

    "On the edge of the world my islands lie,
     Under the sun-steeped sky;
       And their waving palms
       Are bounteous alms
     To the soul-spent passer-by.

    "On the edge of the world my islands sleep
     In a slumber soft and deep.
       What should they know
       Of a world of woe,
     And myriad men that weep?"

On the rim of the world my fancy seemed to see them that May day when we went aboard the huge
Pacific steamship in San Francisco Harbor, and she pointed her prow westward toward the vast
wilderness of the Pacific--on the edge of the world, looking out and down across the vast water
toward Asia and Australia. I wondered if the great iron ship could find them, and if we should
realize or visualize the geography or the astronomy when we got there, and see ourselves on
the huge rotundity of the globe not far above her equatorial girdle.

Yes, on the rim of the world they lie to the traveler steaming toward them, and on the rim
of the world they lie in his memory after his return, basking there in that tropical sunlight,
forever fanned by those cooling trade winds, and encompassed by that morning-glory sea. With
my mind's eye I behold them rising from that enormous abyss of the Pacific, fire-born and rain-carved,
vast volcanic mountains miles deep under the sea, and in some cases miles high above it, clothed
with verdure and teeming with life, the scene of long-gone cosmic strife and destruction, now
the abode of rural and civic peace and plenty.

The Pacific treated me so much better than the Atlantic ever had that I am probably inclined
to overestimate everything I saw on the voyage. It was the first trip at sea that ever gave
me any pleasure. The huge vessels are in themselves a great comfort, and in the placid waters
and the sliding down the rotund side of the great globe under warmer and warmer skies one gains
a very agreeable experience. The first day's run must have carried us out and over that huge
Pacific abyss, the Tuscarora Deep, where there were nearly four miles of water under us. Some
of our aeroplanes have gone up half that distance and disappeared from sight. I fancy that
our ship, more than six hundred feet long, would have appeared a very small object, floating
across this briny firmament, could one have looked up at it from the bottom of that sea.

The Hawaiian Islands rise from the border of that vast deep, and one can fancy how that huge
pot must have boiled back in Tertiary times, when the red-hot lava of which they are mainly
built up was poured from the interior of the globe.

Softer and more balmy grew the air every day, more and more placid and richly tinted grew the
sea, till, on the morning of the sixth day, we saw ahead of us, low on the horizon, the dim
outlines of the mountains of Molokai. The island of Oahu, upon which Honolulu is situated,
was soon in sight. It was not long before we saw Diamond Head, a vast crater bowl, eight hundred
feet high on its ocean side, and half a mile across, sitting there upon the shore like some
huge, strange work of man's hand, running back through the hills with a level rim, and seaward
with a sloping base, brown and ribbed, and in every way unique and striking.

We were approaching a land the child of tropic seas and volcanic lava, and many of the features
were new and strange to us. The mountains looked familiar in outline, but the colors of the
landscape, the soft lilacs, greens, and browns, and the whole atmosphere of the scene, were
unlike anything we had ever before seen. And Diamond Head, what a feature it was! Had it only
had a head, one could easily have seen in it a suggestion of a couchant lion, bony, huge, and
tawny, looking seaward, and guarding the harbor of Honolulu which lies just behind it. Into
this harbor, in the soft morning air, our ship soon found its way, and the monotony of the
vast, unpeopled sea was quickly succeeded by human scenes of the most varied and animated character,
not the least novel of which were the swarms of half-amphibious native boys who surrounded
the vessel as she lay at the wharf, and with brown, upturned faces and beckoning hands tempted
the passengers to toss dimes into the water. As the coins struck the surface they would dive
with the ease and quickness of seals, and seize the silver apparently before it had gone a
yard toward the bottom. Holding the coins up to view between the thumb and finger, they would
slip them into their mouths and solicit more.

On shore we were greeted with the music of the Royal Hawaiian Band, and a motley crowd of Hawaiians,
Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and Americans, bearing colored leis, or wreaths of flowers,
which they waved at friends on board, and with which they bedecked them as soon as they came
off the gangplank. It was a Babel of tongues in which the strange, vowel-choked language of
the Hawaiians was conspicuous.

Honolulu is a beautiful city, clean, bright, well ordered, and well appointed,--electric lights,
good streets, electric cars, fine hotels and clubs, excellent fire protection, mountain water,
libraries, parks, handsome buildings, attractive homes,--in fact, all that we boast of in our
home cities. Embosomed in palms, with mangoes, and other tropical trees, with a profusion of
gorgeously colored vines and hedges, with spacious, well-kept grounds about the large and comfortable
houses in the residential portion--these features, with the ready hospitality of the people,
made our hearts warm towards it at once.

Volcanic heights on all the land side look down upon the city. Mount Tantalus, rising four
thousand feet above the sea, is just back of it, with its long slopes of volcanic ash and sand
now clothed by forests and fertile fields, and a huge ancient crater called the Punch Bowl,
born probably on the selfsame day, the geologists think, as Diamond Head, dominates the city
in the immediate foreground. If the Punch Bowl were again to overflow with the fiery liquid,
the city would soon go up in smoke. But its bowl-like interior is now covered with grass and
trees, and presents a scene of the most peaceful, rural character.

The Orient and the Occident meet in Honolulu. There Asia and America join hands. The main features
of the city are decidedly American, but the people seen upon the street and at work indoors
and out are more than half Oriental. The native population cuts only a small figure. The real
workers--carpenters, masons, field hands, and house servants--are mostly Japanese. Virtually
all the work of the immense sugar plantations is done by the little brown men and women, while
China supplies some of the merchants in the city and the sailors and stewards on the ocean
steamers. What admirable servants the Chinese make, so respectful, so prompt, so silent, so
quick to comprehend! The Japanese house servants on the islands also give efficient and gracious
service.

I had gone to Honolulu reluctantly, but tarried there joyfully. The fine climate, with its
even temperature of about eighty degrees Fahrenheit, and with all that is enervating or oppressive
in that degree of heat winnowed out of it by the ceaseless trade winds; the almost unbroken
sunshine, perfumed now and then by a sprinkle of sunlit rain from the mountains; the wonderful
sea laving the shores on the one hand and the cool, cloud-capped, and rain-drenched heights
within easy reach on the other; the green, cozy valleys; the broad sweep of plain; the new,
strange nature on every side; the novel and delicious fruits; the pepsin-charged papaya, or
tree melon, which tickles the palate while it heals and renews the whole digestive system;
the mangoes (oh, the mangoes!); the cordiality of the people; the inviting bungalows; the clean
streets; the good service everywhere--all made me feel how mistaken was my reluctance.

Most of the Americans one meets there are descendants of the missionaries who went out from
New England and New York early in the last century, and one feels at home with them at once.
Many of the residents there have been educated in the States. The Governor, Mr. Frear, is a
graduate of Yale; his wife is a graduate of Wellesley. One day a charming Southern woman, president
of the College Club, invited us to meet the college women of the city. The gathering took place
under the trees upon the lawn of one of the older homesteads. There were forty college women
present, many of them teachers, from Vassar, Wellesley, Smith, Bryn Mawr, and Barnard. Among
them were two girls who had visited me at my cabin, "Slabsides," while they were at Vassar.

Wide as is the world, the traveler is pretty sure to strike threads of relation with his home
country wherever he goes. I made the acquaintance in Honolulu of a man from my own county;
another, who showed us great kindness, was from an adjoining county; while one day upon the
street I was called by name by a man whom I had known as a boy in the town where I now live.

One Saturday a walking-club, largely made up of men and women teachers, whose native Hawaiian
name meant "Walkers in Unfrequented Places," asked us to join them in a walk up Palola Valley
to the site of an extinct crater well up in the mountains. These walkers in unfrequented places
proved to be real walkers, and gave us all and more than we had bargained for--more mud and
wet and slippery trails through clinging vines and rank lantana scrub than was good for our
shoes and garments or for the bodies inside them. It was a long pull of many miles, at first
up the valley over a fair highway, then into the woods on the mountain-side along a trail that
was muddy and slippery from the recent showers, and most of the time was buried out of sight
beneath the high, coarse stag-horn fern and a thick growth of lantana that met above it as
high as our shoulders. A more discouraging mountain climb I never undertook. They were really
the symbol of London's night romance. They were the tuning fork which gave the pitch for London
pleasures. For romance and gaiety in London are grafted to an otherwise unromantic and lugubrious
hulk. All joys in that terrible city are lugged from overseas, and, in the process of suturing,
the spontaneity has been lost, the buoyancy has disappeared, the honesty has vanished.

But no people can be without romance. No nation can withstand forever the engines of repression.
Not all the moral lawmakers of England have succeeded in stamping out the natural impulses.
Hypocrisy, that great mediator, sits into the game and stacks the cards. There is no more
sensuous dining room in the world than the Savoy. There is no more impressive vision of human
beings in the primitive act of eating than can be gained from the top of the stairway which
leads into that great double room. And nowhere on earth is there a more cosmopolitan gathering
than sits down to the Savoy supper when the theatres are over. Here at least is visual romance;
and when we inspect the people at closer range we glimpse a more intimate romance. One catches
snatches of conversation from a dozen languages within the radius of hearing. Here is modern civilisation
at apogee--the final word in luxury--the dénouement of spectacular
life.

Go to the Aquarium in St. Petersburg, to the Adlon in Berlin, to the Bristol in Vienna, to
the Café de Paris; go wherever you will--to Cairo, to Buenos Aires, to Madrid--the Savoy at
the supper hour surpasses them all. From the pantalooned giants who relieve you of your outer garments
to the farthest table in the room where the great windows overlook the Embankment Gardens, there
is not one note to mar the gorgeous ensemble.

But we must not tarry too long amid the jewelled women, the impeccable music and the subdued conversation
of the Savoy. In fact, it is not possible to linger.

No sooner have we hastened through the courses of our supper and started to sip a liqueur
than we are suddenly plunged into darkness. A hint! A warning! A silent but eloquent reminder
that the moral man must hasten to his bed, that midnight is upon us, that respectability demands
immediate retirement. When the lights come on again there is a gentle fluttering of silken wraps,
a shuffling of feet, a movement of chairs.

The crowds, preparing to depart, are obeying that lofty English law which makes eating illegal
after twelve-thirty. If you tarry after this signal for departure, a Parisian born waiter taps
you gently on the shoulder and begs of you to respect the majesty of the law. Within ten minutes
of the darkened warning the dining room is empty. Liqueurs are left undrunk. Ices are deserted.
Half-consumed salads are abandoned.

Out into the waiting taxis and limousines pours that vast assemblage. In fifteen minutes an atmosphere
of desolation settles upon the streets. The day is ended--completely, finally, irrevocably. The
moral subtleties of the fathers have been sensed and obeyed. Virtue snickers triumphantly.

"And
now?" I demand of my companion.

"S-s-s-h!" he warns. And, leaning over me, he pours strange and lurid information into my gaping
ear. "Now," he whispers, "to the Supper Clubs, the real night life of London--wine, women,
song and dance."

There is a mystery in his mien. And, obeying the warning of an admonishing finger, I silently
follow him into a taxicab. A low, guttural order is given to the driver, the import of which is
shielded from the inquisitive world by my companion using his hands
as a tube to connect his mouth with the ear of the chauffeur.

I had heard of these supper clubs, but they had meant nothing to me. I rarely ate supper and detested
clubs. Their literature which frequently came to me, had left me cold. But, as I was carried
in the taxicab through dark alleys and twisted streets, certain intimations in these printed invitations
came back to me with a new meaning.

Lest the iniquity of the London pleasure seeker be underestimated, let me supply you with the details
of one of these supper club circulars. I will not tell you the name
of the club: it has probably been changed by now. No sooner do the
police put one club out of business (so far as I can see, merely to
gratify the demand of the moralists that all sinners be flayed in
public) than it changes its name and reopens to the old membership.
Let it be noted here that in order to eat or drink in London after
twelve-thirty at night you must be a member of something; and to become
a member of a London supper club is not so easy a matter as one might
imagine. Traitors are forever worming their way into such societies,
and the management exercises typical British discretion in selecting
the devotees for its illegal victualing organisation. A small brook
comes down off the mountain and attempts to make the leap down a high precipice; but the winds
catch it and carry it straight up in the air like smoke. It is translated; it becomes a mere
wraith hovering above the beetling crag. Night and day this goes on, the wind snatching from
the mountains in this summary way the water it has brought them.

On the walk with the Governor we made the acquaintance of some of the land shells for which
these islands are famous--pretty, pearl-like little whorls living on the largest trees, and
about the size of a chipping sparrow's egg, with pointed ends, variously colored. There are
more than two hundred species on the different islands, I think, each valley having varieties
peculiar to itself, showing what a factor isolation is in the evolution of new species. The
Governor and his wife, and a young man who had specialized in conchology, plucked them from
nearly every bush and tree; but my eye, being untrained in this kind of work, was very slow
in finding them.

Coming down from these Hawaiian mountains is like coming out of a dripping tent of clouds into
the clear, warm sunshine. The change is most delightful. Your clothing dries very quickly,
and chilliness gives place to genial warmth. And the prospects that open before you, the glimpses
down into these deep, yellow-green, crater-like valleys, checkered with neat little Chinese
farms, the panorama of the city and the sea unrolling as you come down, and always Diamond
Head standing guard there to the east--how the vision of it all lingers in the memory!

In climbing the heights, it was always a surprise to me to see the Pacific rise up as I rose,
till it stood up like a great blue wall there against the horizon. A level plain unrolls in
the same way as we mount above it, but it does not produce the same illusion of rising up like
a wall or a mountain-range; the blue, facile water cheats the eye.

One of the novel pleasures in which most travelers indulge while in Honolulu is surf-riding
at Waikiki, near Diamond Head. The sea, with a floor of lava and coral, is here shallow for
a long distance out, and the surf comes in at intervals like a line of steeds cantering over
a plain. We went out in our bathing-suits in a long, heavy dugout, with a lusty native oarsman
in each end. When several hundred yards from shore, we saw, on looking seaward, the long, shining
billows coming, whereupon our oarsmen headed the canoe toward shore, and plied their paddles
with utmost vigor, uttering simultaneously a curious, excited cry. In a moment the breaker
caught us and, in some way holding us on its crest, shot us toward the shore like an arrow.
The sensation is novel and thrilling. The foam flies; the waters leap about you. You are coasting
on the sea, and you shout with delight and pray for the sensation to continue. But it is quickly
over. The hurrying breaker slips from under you, and leaves you in the trough, while it goes
foaming on the shore. Then you turn about and row out from the shore again, and wait for another
chance to be shot toward the land on the foaming crest of a great Pacific wave.

I suppose the trick is in the skill of the oarsmen in holding the boat on the pitch of the
billow so that in its rush it takes you with it. The native boys do the feat standing on a
plank. I was tempted to try this myself, but of course made a comical failure.

One of my pleasant surprises in Honolulu--one that gave the touch of nature which made me feel
less a stranger there--was learning that the European skylark had been introduced and was thriving
on the grassy slopes back of the city. The mina, a species of starling from India as large
as our robin and rather showily dressed, with a loud, strident voice, I had seen and heard
everywhere both in town and country, but he was a stranger and did not appeal to me. But the
thought of the skylark brought Shelley and Wordsworth, and English downs and meadows, near
to me at once, and I was eager to hear it. So early one morning we left the Pleasanton, our
tarrying-place, and climbed the long, pastoral slope above the city, where cattle and horses
were grazing, and listened for this minstrel from the motherland. We had not long to wait.
Sure enough, not far from us there sprang from the turf Shelley's bird, and went climbing his
invisible spiral toward the sky, pouring out those hurried, ecstatic notes, just as I had heard
him above the South Downs of England. It was a moment of keen delight to me. The bird soared
and hovered, drifting about, as it were, before the impetuous current of his song, with all
the joy and abandon with which the poets have credited him. It was like a bit of English literature
vocal in the air there above these alien scenes. Presently another went up, and then another,
and still another, the singers behaving in every respect as they do by the Avon and the Tweed,
and for a moment I seemed to be breathing the air that Wordsworth and Shelley breathed.

If our excursion had taken us only to the island of Oahu and its beautiful city, it would have
been eminently worth while, but the last week in May we took what is called the inter-island
trip, a six days' voyage among the various islands, when we visited the great extinct crater
of Haleakala on Maui, and the active volcano Kilauea on Hawaii. It is a voyage over several
rough channels in a small steamer, and my friends said, "If you have not yet paid tribute to
Neptune, you will pay it now." But I did not. My companions were prostrated, but I see Neptune
respects age, and my slumbers were undisturbed. A wireless message had gone to Mr. Aiken, on
the island of Maui, to meet us with his automobile in the morning at the landing at Kahului.
We were taken to the shore on a lighter, along with the horses and cargo, and there found our
new friend awaiting us.

The great mountain of Haleakala rose up in a long line against the sky on the left, and the
deeply eroded and canyoned mountains of the older, or west, end of the island on our right.
Toward the latter our guide took us. It was a pleasant spin along the good roads, in the fresh
morning air, near the beach, to Wailuku, the shire town of the island, two or three miles distant.
Here we were most hospitably entertained in the home of Mr. Penhallow, the director of a large
sugar plantation.

Here for the first time in my life I saw a gang of steam plows working, pulled by a stationary
engine at each end of the field, and turning over the red, heavy volcanic soil. The work was
mainly in the hands of Japanese, and was well done. We afterward saw Japanese by the score,
both men and women, planting a large area of newly plowed land with sugar-cane.

After we were rested and refreshed, and had sampled the mangoes that had fallen from a tree
near the house, Mr. Aiken took us in his automobile up into the famous Iao Valley, at the mouth
of which Wailuku is situated. It is a deep, striking chasm carved out of the mountain by the
stream, rank with verdure of various kinds, and looked down upon by sharp peaks and ridges
five or six thousand feet high. We soon reached the clear rapid, brawling stream, as bright
as a Catskill mountain trout brook, and after a mile or two along its course we came to the
end of the road, where we left the machine and took a trail that wound onward and upward over
a slippery surface and through dripping bushes, for we here began to reach the skirts of the
little showers that almost constantly career over and about the interior of these mountains.
I neither saw nor heard a bird or other live thing. Guava apples lay on the ground all along
the trail, and one could eat them and not make faces. Some of the sharp, knife-blade ridges
that cut down toward us from the higher peaks were very startling, and so steep and high that
they could be successfully scaled only by the aid of ropes and ladders. A more striking object-lesson
in erosion by rain would be hard to find. There were no naked rocks; short, thick vegetation
covered even the steepest slopes, and the vegetable acids which this generated, and the perpetual
rains, weathered the mountains down. It soon became so wet that we stopped far short of the
head of the valley, and turned back. I wished to look into the great, deep, green amphitheatre
which seems to lie at the head, but had glimpses of it only from a distance. How many millenniums
will it be, I said to myself, before erosion will have completed its work here, and these thin,
high mountain-walls will be in ruins? Surely not many.

We returned to the hospitable home we had left, and passed the midday there. In the afternoon
Mr. Aiken, guiding our eyes by the forms of trees that cut the horizon-line on the huge flank
of Haleakala, pointed out the place of his own homestead, twenty or more miles away. From this
point the great mountain appeared like a vast landscape tilted up at an easy angle against
the horizon. One could hardly believe it was ten thousand feet high. The machine climbed easily
more than half the distance to Mr. Aiken's plantation, which we reached in good time in the
afternoon, and where we passed a very enjoyable night. It was a surprise to find swarms of
mosquitoes at this altitude, so free from all mosquito-breeding waters. But the house was well
protected against them. Mosquitoes, as well as flies and vermin, are not native to the island.
They came in ships not very long ago, and are now very troublesome in certain parts. They came
round the Horn. Mr. Aiken's house itself came round the Horn seventy or eighty years ago. It
is a quaint, New England type of house, and has a very homelike look. In front of it, near
the gate, stands a Japanese pine which is an object of veneration to all Japanese who chance
to come that way. Often their eyes fill with tears on beholding it, so responsive are the little
yellow men to associations of home.

In the morning Mr. Aiken drove us in a wagon to a place he has called "Idlewild," six miles
farther up the great slope of the mountain. This slope of Haleakala is like a whole township,
diversified with farms and woods, valleys and hills, resting on its elbows, so to speak, and
looking out over the Pacific. We could look up to the cloud-line, about seven thousand feet
above the sea, and occasionally get a glimpse of the long line of the summit through rifts
in the clouds. At Idlewild our expedition, consisting of six mules and four people, was fitted
out, and in the early afternoon we started on the trail up the mountain.

For several miles our way led over grassy slopes where cattle were grazing, and above which
skylarks were singing. This was one of the happy surprises of the trip--the soaring and singing
skylarks. All the way till we reached the cloud-belt, we had the larks pouring down their music
from the sky above us. They seemed specially jubilant. It was May in England, too, and they
sang as though the spirit of those downs and fells was stirring in their hearts, under alien
skies, but true to the memories of home.

Before we reached the summit we came upon another introduction from overseas--the English pheasant.
One started up from some bushes only a few yards from the trail, went booming away, and disappeared
in a deep gully. A little later another sprang up, uttering a cackling cry as it flew away.
We saw three altogether. The only home thing we saw was white clover in patches here and there,
and it gave a most welcome touch to the unfamiliar scenes.

The cattle we passed on the way were suffering dreadfully from another introduction from the
States--the Texas horn-fly, which had recently made its appearance. The poor beasts were driven
half-crazy by it, as their sunken eyes and poor condition plainly showed.

The trail became rougher and steeper as we ascended, and the grass and trees gave place to
low, scrubby bushes. We were half an hour or more in the cloud-belt, where the singing skylarks
did not follow us. The clouds proved to be as loose of texture and as innocent as any summer
fog that loiters in our valleys; but it was good to emerge into the sunshine again, and see
the jagged line of the top sensibly nearer, and the canopy of clouds unroll itself beneath
us. Far ahead of us and near the summit we saw a band of wild goats--twenty-two, I counted--leisurely
grazing along, and now and then casting glances down upon us. They were domestic animals gone
wild, and still retained their bizarre colors of white and black. One big black leader with
a long beard looked down at us and shook his head threateningly. We reached the summit before
the sun reached the horizon, and our eyes looked forth upon a strange world, indeed. On one
hand the vast sea of cloud, into which the sun was about to drop, rolled away from the mountain
below us, with its white surface and the irregular masses rising up from it, suggesting a sea
of floating ice. Through rifts in it we caught occasional glimpses of the Pacific--blue, vague,
mystical gulfs that seemed filled with something less substantial than water. On the other
hand was the vast crater of Haleakala, two thousand feet deep, and many miles across, in which
the shadows were deepening, and which looked like some burned-out Hades.

We stood or sat on the jagged edge and saw the day depart and the night come down, the glory
of cloud and sea and sunset on the one hand, and on the other side the fearful chasm of the
extinct volcano, red and black and barren, with the hosts of darkness gathering in it. It was
like a seat between heaven and hell. Then later, when the Southern Cross came out and rose
above the awful gulf, the scene was most impressive.

The crater of Haleakala is said to be the largest extinct crater in the world. To follow all
its outlines would lead one a distance of more than twenty miles, but it is so irregular in
shape that one gets only a poor conception of its extent in a view from its brink. At its widest
part it cannot be more than four or five miles across. It was evidently formed by the whole
top of the mountain having been blown out or else sunk down in recent geologic times. The fragments
of jagged rock that thickly strew the surface all about the summit look as if they might have
fallen there. The floor of the interior of the crater is thickly studded with many minor craters,
through which the internal fires found vent after the crater as a whole had ceased to act.
They are of the shape of huge haystacks, with a hole in the top, and looked soft and yielding
in outline, and in color as though they were composed of soot and brick-dust. One of them is
much larger than any of the rest. I thought it might be two hundred feet high. "It is eight
hundred," said our guide; yet its summit was more than a thousand feet below the rim upon which
we sat.

There has been no eruption in Haleakala since early in the last century. Over a large area
of the interior the black lava, cracked and crumpled, meets the eye. Miles down one of its
great arms toward the sea, we could see the green lines of vegetation, mostly rank ferns, advancing
like an invading army. Nelson--The bronze statue of Lord Nelson in the Bull Ring was executed
by Westmacott, and uncovered June 6, 1809. The artist received £2,500, but the total cost (raised
by subscription) with the pedestal, lamps, and palisading, was nearly £3,000. The corner posts
are old cannon from the Admiral's ship the Victory.

Peel.--The statue of Sir Robert Peel, near the Town Hall, cost £2,000, and was unveiled August
27, 1855. He faced towards Christ Church at first, and was protected from Tories and Protectionists
by iron railings, until March, 1878, when his bonds were loosed, and he was allowed to look
down New Street.

Priestley.--The statue of the discoverer of oxygen, near the Town Hall, was uncovered August 1,
1884. The amount subscribed as a Priestley memorial fund was £1,820, of which £972 went for
the philosopher's stone effigy, about £10 for a tablet on the site of his house at Fair Hill,
and £653 to the Midland Institute to found a scholarship in chemistry.

Prince Albert and the Queen.--In 1862, after the death of the Prince Consort, a Memorial Committee
was formed and a fund raised for a statue, the execution of which was entrusted to Mr. Foley,
and it is said to be one of his finest productions. It was placed in the old Art Gallery,
and uncovered August 27, 1863.

It was in the reading-room at the time of the fire, but fortunately escaped injury. The balance
of the fund was deemed sufficient for a companion statue of Her Majesty, and Mr. Foley received
the commission for it in 1871. At his death the order was given to
Mr. Woolner, who handed over his work to the town in May, 1884, the
ceremony of unveiling taking place on the 9th of that month. According
to the Athanæum it is "one of the finest portrait statues of the English
School, combining a severe yet elegant design with execution of the
highest kind, every element being thoroughly artistic." Thousands
have seen it alongside the Prince's statue in the hall of the Reference
Library, but few indeed have been heard to say they like it. It consists of a great mass of silvery-white, bristling leaves resting
upon the ground, from which rises a stalk, strung with flowers, to the height of five or six
feet. It is evidently of the Yucca type of plant, and has met with a singular transformation
in the sleeping volcano's mouth, all its harsh and savage character turned into gentleness
and grace, its armament of needles and daggers giving place to a soft, silvery down. We did
not see the plant growing except at a great distance, through field-glasses, but we saw a photograph
of it and a dried specimen after we came down from the summit.

It is an all day's trip down into the crater and back, climbing over sliding sands and loose
scoria, and our time was too limited to undertake it. We passed the night on the summit in
a rude stone hut, which had a fireplace where the guide made coffee, but we had only the volcanic
rock for floor. Upon this we spread our ample supply of blankets, and got such sleep as is
to be had on high, cold mountain-tops, where the ribs of the mountain prove to be so much harder
than one's own ribs--not a first-class quality of sleep, but better than none.

I arose about two o'clock, and made my way out into the star-blazing night. Such glory of the
heavens I had never before seen. I had never before been lifted up so near them, and hence
had never before seen them through so rarefied an atmosphere. The clouds and vapors had disappeared,
and all the hosts of heaven were magnified. The Milky Way seemed newly paved and swept. There
was no wind and no sound. The mighty crater was a gulf of blackness, but the sky blazed with light.

The dawn comes early on such a mountain-top, and before four o'clock we were out under the
fading stars. As we had seen the day pass into night, surrounded by these wonderful scenes,
now we saw the night pass into day, and the elemental grandeur on every hand reborn before
us. There was not a wisp of cloud or fog below us or about us to blur the great picture. The
sun came up from behind the vast, long, high wall of the Pacific that filled the eastern horizon,
and the shadows fled from the huge pile of mountain in the west. We hung about the rim of the
great crater or sat upon the jagged rocks, wrapped in our blankets, till the sun was an hour high.

We got another glimpse of the band of goats picking their way from ledge to ledge far below
us on the side of the crater. I saw and heard two or three mina birds fly past, apparently
seeking new territory to occupy. These birds are more enterprising than the English sparrows,
which also swarm in the island towns but do not brave the mountain-heights. The bird from India
seems at home everywhere.

After breakfast we still haunted for an hour or more the brink of the great abyss, where one
seemed to feel the pulse of primal time, loath to tear ourselves away, loath also to take a
last view of the panorama of land and sea, lit by the morning sun, which spread out far below
us. To the southeast we could dimly see the outlines of the island of Hawaii, with a faint
gleam of snow on its great mountain Mauna Loa, nearly fourteen thousand feet high. In the northwest
a dim, dark mass low in the horizon marked the place of Oahu. The ocean rose in the vast horizon
and blended with the sky. The eye could not tell where one ended and the other began.

The mules had had a comfortable night in a rude stone stable against the rocks, and were more
eager to hit the down trail than were we. The descent proved more fatiguing than the ascent,
the constant plunging motion of the animals' shoulders being a sore trial. We dropped down
through the belt of clouds that had begun to form, and out into the grassy region of the singing
skylarks, past herds of grazing cattle, and at noon were again at Idlewild, resting our weary
limbs and comforting the inner man.

In the afternoon Mr. Aiken drove us back to his home farm, where we again passed a very pleasant
night. In the morning I walked with him through his pineapple plantation. It was a new kind
of farming and fruit-growing to me. I forget now how many hundred thousand plants his field
contained. They are set and cultivated much as cabbage is with us, but present a strangely
stiff and forbidding aspect. The first cutting is when the plants are about eighteen months
old, one large solid apple from each plant. The second crop is called the "raggoon" crop, and
yields two apples from each plant, but smaller and less valuable than the first. The field
is then reset. I also walked with Mr. Aiken over some new land he was getting ready for pineapples.
It had been densely covered with lantana scrub, and clearing it and grubbing it out had been
an heroic task. The lantana takes complete possession of the soil, grows about four or five
feet high, and makes a network of roots in the soil that defies anything but a steam plow.
The soil is a red, heavy clay, and it made the farmer in me sweat to think of the expenditure
of labor necessary to turn a lantana bush into a pineapple field. The redness of this volcanic
soil is said to be owing to the fact that the growth of vegetation brings the iron into new
combinations with organic acids.

Later in the day we visited the large Baldwin pineapple-canning plant, and were shown the whole
process of preparing and canning the fruit, and all but surfeited with the most melting and
delicious pineapples it was ever my good luck to taste. The Hawaiian pineapple probably surpasses
all others in tenderness and lusciousness, and it loses scarcely any of these qualities in
the cans. Ripened in the field, where it grew on the flanks of great Haleakala, and eaten out
of hand, it is a dream of tropic lusciousness. The canning is done by an elaborate system of
machinery managed by Japanese men and women, the naked hand never coming in contact with the
peeled fruit, but protected from it by long, thin rubber gloves. There ought to be a great
future for this industry, when Eastern consumers really find out the superior quality of the
Hawaiian product.

From Mr. Aiken's house one has a view of the great wall of mountains that form the western
and older--older geologically--end of the island, in which lies the famous Iao Valley, which
I have already described. We judge, from the much deeper marks of rain erosion, that this end
of the island is vastly older than the butt end upon which Haleakala is situated. Haleakala
is eroded comparatively little. On all its huge northern slope there is only one considerable
gash or gully, and this is probably not many thousand years old; but the northwestern end of
the island is worn and carved in the most striking manner. Looking at it that morning, I compared
it to my extended, relaxed hand, the northern end being gashed and grooved like the sunken
spaces between the fingers, while the southwest end, not more than ten miles distant, was only
slightly grooved and more like the solid wrist and back hand. All the rains brought by the
northeast trades fall upon the northeast end of the islands. The mountain-peaks on the end
hold the clouds and strip them dry, so that little or no rain falls upon the south and southwest
sides. This is true of all the islands. One end of each is arid and barren, while the other
is wet and verdant. One of the smaller islands, Kahoolawe, I believe, dominated by Maui on
the northeast, is said to be drying up and blowing away by inches.

What a spell the mountains do lay upon the clouds everywhere,--the robber mountains,--in these
islands exacting the last drop of water of all the ocean-born vapors that pass over them! On
the northeast side of the Lahaina district there are valleys four or five thousand feet deep;
on the southwest side there are no valleys worth mentioning. The difference in this respect
was forcibly brought home to me when, later in the day, we made an automobile trip from Wailuku
to Lahaina on the southwest side; in going less than twenty miles we quickly passed from the
region of verdant valleys and mountain-slopes into a hard, raw, barren, unweathered region,
where there was no soil, and where the rocks looked as crude and forbidding as they must have
looked the day they flowed out from the depths as molten lava. In outline the island of Maui
suggests a truncated statue, the west end representing the head, very old and wrinkled and
grooved by time and trouble, the peninsula the well-proportioned neck, and broad-breasted Haleakala
forming the trunk. What a torso it is, fire-born and basking there in the tropic seas!

The oldest island of the Hawaiian group is Kauai, called the garden island, because it has
much the deepest and most fertile soil. It shows much more evidence of erosion than any of
the other islands. The next in point of erosion, and hence in point of age, is Oahu, upon which
Honolulu is situated. Then come Molokai and Maui, the two ends of the latter being of vastly
unequal age. Hawaii, the largest of them all, nearly as large as Connecticut, is the youngest
of the group, and shows the least effects of erosion. When it is as old as Kauai is now, its
two huge mountains, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, will probably be cut up into deep valleys and
canons and sharp, high ridges, as are the mountains of Kauai and Oahu. The lapse of time required
to bring about such a result is beyond all human calculation. Whether one million or two millions
of years would do it, who knows? Those warm tropical rains, aided by the rank vegetation which
they beget and support, dissolve the volcanic rock slowly but inevitably.

Through the courtesy of Mr. Lowell, the superintendent, we had that day the pleasure of going
through a large sugar-making plant at Paia--one that turns out nearly fifty thousand tons of
sugar a year. We saw the cane come in from the fields in one end of the plant, and the dry,
warm product being put up in bags at the other. All the latest devices and machinery for sugar-making
we saw here in full operation, affording a contrast to the crude and wasteful methods I had
seen in the island of Jamaica a few years before.

In the afternoon we availed ourselves of the five or six miles of narrow-gauge railway, the
only one on the island, to go from Paia to Wailuku, where we were met by another automobile,
which hurried us to Lahaina, where we were to meet the steamer that was to convey us to Hilo,
on Hawaii. I say "hurried," but before the journey of twenty-odd miles was half over, we realized
the truth of the old adage, "The more haste, the less speed." The automobile began to sulk
and finally could be persuaded to go only on the low gear, and to rattle along at about the
speed of a man with a horse and buggy. We reached Lahaina just as the boat was entering the harbor.

The next morning we found ourselves steaming along past the high, verdant shores of Hawaii.
For fifty miles or more the land presented one unbroken expanse of sugar-cane, suggesting fields
of some gigantic yellow-green grass. At Hilo the sun was shining between brief showers, and
the air was warm and muggy. It is said to rain there every day in the year, and the lush vegetation
made the statement seem credible. Judge Andrews met us at the steamer, and took us to his home
for rest and dinner, and was extremely kind to us.

In the mid-afternoon we took the train for Glenwood, thirty miles on our way to the volcano
of Kilauea. A large part of the way the road leads through sugar plantations, newly carved
out of the koa and tree-fern wilderness that originally covered the volcanic soil. Clusters
of the little houses of the Japanese laborers, perched high above the ground on slender posts,
were passed here and there. Everywhere we saw wooden aqueducts, or flumes, winding around the
contours of the hills and across the little valleys, often on high trestle-work, and partly
filled with clear, swift-running water, in which the sugar-cane was transported to the mills.

At Glenwood stages meet the tourists and convey them over a fairly good road that winds through
the tree-fern forests to the Volcano House, ten miles away. The beauty of that fern-lined forest,
the long, stately plumes of the gigantic ferns meeting the eye everywhere, I shall not soon
forget. I saw what appeared to be a large, showy red raspberry growing by the roadside, but
I did not find it at all tempting to the taste.

It was dark when we reached the Volcano House, and we saw off to the left a red glow upon the
fog-clouds, like the reflected light from a burning barn or house in the country, and inferred
at once that it came from the volcano, which it did. From my window that night, as I lay in
bed, I could see this same angry glow upon the clouds. The smell of sulphur was in the air
about the hotel, and very hot steam was issuing from cracks in the rocks. A party of tourists
on horseback, in the spirit of true American hurry, visited the volcano that night, but we
chose to wait until the morrow.

The next morning the great crater of Kilauea was filled with fog, but it lifted, and the sun
shone before noon. We passed a pleasant forenoon strolling along the tree-fringed brink, looking
down eight or nine hundred feet upon its black lava floor, and plucking ohelo berries, which
grew there abundantly, a kind of large, red huckleberry that one could eat out of hand, but
that one could not get excited over. They were better in a pie than in the hand. Their name
seemed to go well with the suggestion of the scenes amid which they grew. Kilauea is a round
extinct crater about three miles across and seven or eight hundred feet deep. It has been the
scene of terrific explosions in past ages, but it has now dwindled to the small active crater
of Halemaumau, which is sunk near the middle of it like a huge pot, two hundred or more feet
deep and a thousand feet across.

In the mid-afternoon a party of eight or ten of us on horseback set out to visit the volcano.
The trail led down the broken and shelving side of the crater, amid trees and bushes, till
it struck the floor of lava at the bottom. In going down I was aware all the time of a beautiful
bird-song off on my left, a song almost as sweet as that of our hermit thrush, but of an entirely
different order. I think it was the song of one of the honey-suckers, a red bird with black
wings that in flight looked like our scarlet tanager.

Our course took us out over the cracked and contorted lava-beds, where no green thing was growing.
The forms of the lava-flow suggested mailed and writhing dragons, with horrid, gaping mouths
and vicious claws. The lava crunched beneath the horses' feet like shelly and brittle ice.
At one point we passed over a wide, jagged crack on a bridge. As we neared the crater, the
rocks grew warm, and sulphur and other fumes streaked the air.

When a half-mile from the crater we dismounted, and, leaving our horses in charge of the guide,
proceeded on foot over the cracked and heated lava rocks toward the brink of this veritable
devil's caldron. The sulphur fumes are so suffocating that it can be approached only on the
windward side. The first glance into that fearful pit is all that your imagination can picture
it. You look upon the traditional lake of brimstone and fire, and if devils were to appear
skipping about over the surface with pitchforks, turning their victims as the cook turns her
frying crullers in the sputtering fat, it would not much astonish you. This liquid is rather
thick and viscid, but it is boiling furiously. Great masses of it are thrown up forty or fifty
feet, and fall with a crash like that of the surf upon the shore. Livid jets are thrown up
many feet high against the sides and drip back, cooling quickly as the lava descends. We sat
or stood upon the brink, at times almost letting our feet hang over the sides, and shielding
our faces from the intense heat with paper masks and veils. It is probably the only place in
the world where you can come face to face with the heart of an active volcano. There are no
veils of vapor to hide it from you. It appears easy enough to cast a stone into the midst of
it, but none of us could quite do it.

The mass of boiling lava is said to be about one and one half acres in extent. Its surface
is covered with large masses of floating crust, black and smooth, like leather or roofing-paper,
and between these masses, or islands, the molten lava shows in broad, vivid lines. It is never
quiet. When not actually boiling, there is a slow circulatory movement, and the great flakes
of black crust, suggesting scum, drift across from one end to the other and are drawn under
the rocks. At one moment only this movement is apparent, then suddenly the mass begins to boil
furiously all over the surface, and you hear dimly the sound of the bursting bubbles and the
crash of the falling lava. When this takes place, the black floating masses are broken up and
scattered as they are in boiling maple-syrup, but they quickly reunite, and are carried on
by the current as before.

Looking upon this scene with the thought of the traditional lake of fire and brimstone of our
forefathers in mind, you would say that these black, filthy-looking masses floating about on
the surface were the accumulation of all the bad stuff that had been fried out of the poor
sinners since hell was invented. How much wickedness and uncharity and evil thought it would
represent! If the poor victims were clarified and made purer by the process, then it would
seem worth while.

At the Volcano House they keep a book in which tourists write down their impressions of the
volcano. A distinguished statesman had been there a few days before us, and had written a long
account of his impressions, closing with this oratorical sentence: "No pen, however gifted,
can describe, no brush, however brilliant, can portray, the wonders we have been permitted
to behold." I could not refrain from writing under it, "I have seen the orthodox hell, and
it's the real thing."

That huge kettle of molten metal, mantling and bubbling, how it is impressed upon my memory!
It is a vestige of the ancient cosmic fire that once wrapped the whole globe in its embrace.
It had a kind of brutal fascination. One could not take one's eyes from it. That network of
broad, jagged, fiery lines defining those black, smooth masses, or islands, of floating matter
told of a side of nature we had never before seen. We lingered there on the brink of the fearful
spectacle till night came on, and the sides of the mighty caldron, and the fog-clouds above
it, glowed in the infernal light. Not so white as the metal pouring from a blast furnace, not
so hot, a more sullen red, but welling up from the central primordial fires of the earth. This
great pot has boiled over many times in the recent past, as the lava-beds we traveled over
testify, and it will probably boil over again. It has been unusually active these last few years.

About nine o'clock we rode back, facing a cold, driving mist, the back of each rider, protected
by the shining yellow "slickers," glowing to the one behind him, in the volcano's light, till
we were a mile or more away.

The next morning came clear, and the sight of the mighty slope of Mauna Loa, lit up by the
rising sun, was a grand spectacle. It looked gentle and easy of ascent, wooded here and there,
and here and there showing broad, black streaks from the lava overflows at the summit in recent
years; but remembering that it was nearly four thousand feet higher than Haleakala, I had no
desire to climb it. This mountain and its companion, Mauna Kea, are the highest island mountains
in the world.

The stage rolled us back through the fern forest to the railway station and thence on to Hilo
again, where in good time, in the afternoon, we went aboard the steamer; and the next morning
we were again in the harbor of Honolulu, glad we had made the inter-island trip, and above
all glad that we had seen Haleakala.

VI

THE OLD ICE-FLOOD

I

He was a bold man who first conceived the idea of the great continental ice-sheet which in
Pleistocene times covered most of the northern part of the continent, and played such a part
in shaping the land as we know it. That bold man was Agassiz, who, however, was not bold enough
to accept the theory of evolution as propounded by Darwin. The idea of the great glacier did
not conflict with Agassiz's religious predilections, and the theory of evolution did. It was
a bold generalization, this of the continental ice-sheet, one of the master-strokes of the
scientific imagination. It was about the year 1840 that Agassiz, fresh from the glaciers of
the Alps, went to Scotland looking for the tracks of the old glaciers, and he found them at
once when he landed near Glasgow. We can all find them now on almost every walk we take to
the fields and hills; but until our eyes are opened, how blind we are to them! We are like
people who camp on the trail of an army and never suspect an army has passed, though the ruts
made by their wagons and artillery and the ruins of their intrenchments are everywhere visible.

When I was a boy on the farm we never asked ourselves questions about the stones and rocks
that encumbered the land--whence they came, or what the agency was that brought them. The farmers
believed the land was created just as we saw it--stones, boulders, soil, gravel-pits, hills,
mountains, and all--and doubtless wished in their hearts that the Creator had not been so particular
about the rocks and stones, or had made an exception in favor of their own fields. Rocks and
stones were good for fences and foundations, and for various other uses, but they were a great
hindrance to the cultivation of the soil. I once heard a farmer boast that he had very strong
land--it had to be strong to hold up such a crop of rocks and stones. When the Eastern farmer
moved west into the prairie states, or south into the cotton-growing states, he probably never
asked himself why the Creator had not cumbered the ground with rocks and stones in those sections,
as he had in New York and New England. South of the line that runs irregularly through middle
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and so on to the Rockies, he will
find few loose stones scattered over the soil, no detached boulders sitting upon the surface,
no hills or mounds of gravel and sand, no clay banks packed full of rounded stones, little
and big, no rocky floors under the soil which look as if they had been dressed down by a huge
but dulled and nicked jack-plane. The reason is that the line I have indicated marks the limit
of the old ice-sheet which more than a hundred thousand years ago covered all the northern
part of the continent to a depth of from two to four thousand feet, and was the chief instrument
in rounding off mountain-tops, scattering rock-fragments, little and big, over our landscapes,
grinding down and breaking off the protruding rock strata, building up our banks of mingled
clay and stone, changing the courses of streams and rivers, deepening and widening our valleys,
transplanting boulders of one formation for hundreds of miles, and dropping them upon the surface
of another formation. When it began to melt and retreat, it was the chief agent in building
up our river terraces, and our long, low, rounded hills of sand and gravel and clay, called
kames and drumlins. In many of our valleys its flowing waters left long, low ridges, gentle
in outline, made up entirely of sand and gravel, or of clay. In other places it left moraines
made up of earth, gravel, and rock-fragments that make a very rough streak through the farmer's
land. All those high, level terraces along the Hudson, such as that upon which West Point stands,
were the work of the old ice-sheet that once filled the river valley. The melting ice was also
the chief agent in building up the enormous clay-banks that are found along the shores of the
Hudson. The clay formed in very still waters, the sand and gravel in more active waters.

This great ice-sheet not only covered our northern farms with rocks and stones, and packed
the soil with rounded boulders, but it also carried away much of the rock decay that goes to
the making of the soil, so that the soil is of greater depth in the non-glaciated than in the
glaciated areas of the country. The New-Englander or New-Yorker in traveling in the Southern
States may note the enormous depth of soil as revealed by the water-courses or railroad cuts.
The ice-sheet was a huge mill that ground up the rocks in the North probably as fast or faster
than the rains and the rank vegetation reduced them in the South, but the floods of water which
it finally let loose carried a great deal of the rock-waste into the sea.

The glacier milk which colors the streams that flow from beneath it finally settles and makes
clay. Off the great Malaspina Glacier in Alaska the ocean is tinged by the glacier milk for
nearly fifty miles from the shores. Very few country people, even among the educated, are ready
to believe that this enormous ice-sheet ever existed. To make them believe that it is just
as much a fact in the physical history of this continent as the war of the Revolution is a
fact in our political history is no easy matter. It certainly is a crushing proposition. It
so vastly transcends all our experience with ice and snow, or the experience of the race since
the dawn of history, that only the scientific imagination and faith are equal to it. The belief
in it rests on indubitable evidence, its record is written all over our landscape, but it requires,
I say, the scientific imagination to put the facts together and make a continuous history.

Three or four hundred feet above my cabin, five or six hundred feet above tidewater, there
is a bold rocky point upon which the old ice-sheet bore heavily. It has rubbed it down and
flattened it as a hand passing over a knob of soft putty might do. The great hand in this case
moved from the northeast and must have fairly made this rocky prominence groan with its weight.
The surface, scratched and grooved and planed by the ice, has weathered away, leaving the rock
quite rough; its general outlines alone tell the tale of the battle with the ice. But on the
east side a huge mass of rock, that had been planed and gouged by the glacier, was detached
and toppled over, turning topsy-turvy before it had weathered, and it lies in such a position,
upheld by two rock fragments, that its glaciated surface, though protected from the weather,
is clearly visible. You step down two or three feet between the two upholding rocks and are
at the entrance of a little cave, and there before you, standing at an angle of thirty or forty
degrees, is this rocky page written over with the history of the passing of the great ice plane.
The surface exposed is ten or twelve feet long, and four or five feet wide, and it is as straight
and smooth, and the scratches and grooves are as sharp and distinct as if made yesterday. I
often take the college girls there who come to visit me, to show them, as I tell them, where
the old ice gods left their signatures. The girls take turns in stooping down and looking along
the under surface of the rock, and feeling it with their hands, and marveling. They have read
or heard about these things, but the reading or hearing made little impression upon their minds.
When they see a concrete example, and feel it with their hands, they are impressed. Then when
I tell them that there is not a shadow of a doubt but that the ice was at one time two or three
thousand feet thick above the place where they now stand, and that it bore down upon Julian's
Rock with a weight of thousands of tons to the square foot, that it filled all the Hudson River
Valley, and covered the landscape for thousands of miles around them, riding over the tops
of the Catskills and of the Adirondacks, and wearing them down and carrying fragments of rock
torn from them hundreds of miles to the south and southwest,--when I have told them all of
this, I have usually given them a mouthful too big for them to masticate or swallow. As a sort
of abstract proposition contained in books, or heard in the classroom, they do not mind it,
but as an actual fact, here in the light of common day on the hill above Slabsides, with the
waters of the Hudson glistening below, and the trees rustling in the wind all about us, that
is quite another matter. It sounds like a dream or a fable. Many of the processes that have
made our globe what we see it have been so slow and on such a scale that they are quite beyond
our horizon--beyond the reach of our mental apprehension. The mind has to approach them slowly
and tentatively, and become familiar with the idea of them, before it can give any sort of
rational assent to them. It has taken the geologist a long time to work out and clear up and
confirm this conception of the great continental glacier which in Pleistocene times covered
so large a part of the northern hemisphere. It is now as well established as any event in the
remote past well can be. Both the Zechs have passed away but their descendants are in the front
rank as musical artists, teachers and composers.

A celebrated artist in his line was Urban, the violin repairer.

Phaff, the flute and clarinet man was another. Others were Senor Nojica, maker of guitars, harps
in the Italian quarter of Kearny street, Charles Morrill, of banjos, Tall Dan Delaney, drummer
at Maguire's Theater (who wouldn't learn a note of music and played as he pleased) who repaired
drums, and C.C. Keene, maker of accordeons, in former days much played, Professor Wm. T. Ferrer,
the guitarist, lately deceased, came here in early days from Mexico with his family and made a
place for himself as a guitar and mandolin teacher. His family were all talented, Annita Ferrer
was a beautiful soprano singer and sang in concert and church. She occupied the place as soloist
in Calvary Church for a while when the choir was composed of Harry Gates, tenor, Fred Borneman,
bass, M.R. Blake, contralto, G.A. Scott, organist. Prof. Ferrer was not a commonplace performer,
but played operatic selections of his own arrangement for the guitar that no one else attempted
as far as I can recollect. He had a severe time in the beginning as prices for lessons were
so low, and he had all he could do to keep the wolf from the door.

We gave him several benefits which were greatly appreciated. One night we crowded the old Mercantile
Hall with his admirers. The singers and players were Mrs. Hall McAllister, Mrs. Marriner-Campbell,
Clara Tippits, Amphion Quartette, Mrs. M.R. Blake, Sig. Mancusie, Wunderlich, J. Stadfeldt, Harry
Hunt, accompanist. I shall always remember that night. The dear professor thanked us with broken
speech, tears filling his eyes. He said the excellent program was a surprise and one of the
greatest pleasures he had in California. He was made doubly glad by a well-filled purse of a thousand
dollars, the receipts of the concert.

This act on our part made him our perpetual friend until he died. He lived long enough to see
his prices increased fourfold, which enabled him in his later years to live in apparent comfort.
We were glad of it for everybody liked Prof. M.W. Ferrer. He passed to his rest several years
ago.

Among the earlier piano dealers were Badger & Lindenberger, who handled the Chickering pianos
and also did a wholesale clothing business (a strange combination) at Battery and Merchant streets.
After several years they were succeeded by the surviving partner, Wm. G. Badger, who continued
the business until his death, after which it was disposed of by his heirs. Mr. Badger was
a faithful worker in the Sabbath schools and took a deep interest to promote good music among
the young. Some time in 1874 he produced the cantata of Esther, with Madam Anna Bishop, queen,
W.C. Campbell, king, Vernon Lincoln, Hamen, Mrs. M.R. Blake, Hamen's wife. The old Platt's hall
was packed to its fullest capacity. The cantata was given to the unbounded delight of Mr. Badger,
and the audience cheered us all to the utmost. Enthusiasm was at the highest pitch and encomiums
of praise were showered upon us. Those were halcyon days for fine singers. We had no lack of voices
to call upon at all times.

Among the earliest music stores was that of an aged Italian named
Salvator Rosa.

He occupied half of a store on Montgomery street, near Market, and was a genial, quiet old
gentleman, who spoke very little English. His stock was principally selections from Italian
operas, of which he knew every note. Both American and Italian artists loved to visit the old fellow
and sun themselves in his doorway.

Rosa moved later to Sacramento street and continued in the field and was followed by Rasche Bros.,
in turn by J.T. Bowers, a brother-in-law of the Rasche brothers. After Bowers, the business was
conducted by Chas. S. Eaton, and then after some years faded from sight. Also established in
the music literature business at one time in Clay street, was Schubert & Co.'s branch New York
house, succeeded by the Ruppell Bros., their managers, who later gave up the business. Blackman
& Davis, Southerners, tried the business for a while, being among the first to occupy a store
in the original Phelan Building. Another off-shoot of Gray's was John Broder, who commenced
work as a little boy. He is now in ripe manhood conducting a similar business in the Byron
Mauzy building on Post street where he is still successfully conducting
the work he chose when a boy.

Engaged in the earlier years of the music business was Woodworth, Allover & Co. Here the founder
of the present firm of Benj. Curtaz & Son was employed. Woodworth, Allover & Co. dealt mostly
in imported French pianos and harmoniums. They were succeeded by Woodworth, Schell & Co. and
with them was connected Mr. Curtaz, who later was in the firm of Hemme & Long. Woodworth,
Schell & Co. after several years discontinued. A.L. Bancroft & Co. for a few years also engaged
in the music business on Market street but later retired. A. Waldteufel was a late comer from
San Jose and sold Blethner pianos. His chief clerk was the late well known Julius Oettl, a
fine teacher of the piano and an encyclopedia of musical knowledge.

Later he was in the music department of the branch house in Oakland of Kohler, Chase & Co. with
whom he was connected until sickness prevented his continuing in the business any longer.
He died several years ago, mourned by many friends he had made in his long career of music in
the state. S.H. Long, a music teacher from Marysville, after handling the Chickering piano for a while
at the corner of Montgomery and Post streets was joined by August Hemme and for several years
they manufactured the Hemme & Long pianos. They are both deceased and the business was continued
for a while by Mr. E. Caswell and Mr. Curtaz but finally was wound up.

The well known firm of the Zeno Mauvais Music Co. was established in 1877 at 420 Twelfth street,
Oakland, under the name of its founder, Zeno Mauvais. In 1882 it was deemed best to locate in San Francisco
and at 749 Market street the stock and sign was first shown to the people on that side of the bay.
Two years later the business had so increased as to make a removal to more commodious quarters
an absolute necessity.

769 Market street was secured and with the increased facilities for carrying stock and attending
to the wants of patrons the business was soon in a fair way to eclipse in volume its oldest competitors.
Mr. Mauvais saw early in his musical career that the public demanded more "up-to-date methods"
in the way of "bargains" "right prices" and "square dealing" than had been offered before, and he began
to put into operation the policy of "quick sales and small profits" which was characteristic of
the house during its entire existence and brought to it an ever increasing trade. One of the special
features was the handling of enormous quantities of the 50-cent folios and the 10-cent editions
of popular issues. These were bought in carload lots and sent out to nearly every quarter of the
globe. Pianos and musical goods of all descriptions were included in the lines carried by
the firm, whose well known policy of discounting its bills enabled it to secure very desirable
agencies and lowest prices on all purchases. In June, 1890, the house sustained an irreparable
loss by the death of its founder, Zeno Mauvais, who passed away after a very brief illness. Devotion
to business and a never ceasing expenditure of energy and vital force was the cause of this
man's withdrawal from the activity of an hitherto busy life, during which he made and kept
many friends. The incorporation of the firm under the name of the Zeno Mauvais Co. was the
next change made in the affairs of this house. Mrs. Mae Mauvais was elected president and
during the next five years her brother, R.L. Eames, occupied the position of manager. At this
time a change being deemed expedient, Mr. H.S. Stedman, who had been connected with the house
since 1883, was elected as manager and secretary, continuing as such until the conflagration of
1906 destroyed the entire stock together with all the books of the
concern.

Under the new management the firm renewed its effort to expand and took the two upper floors of the
building in addition to the one previously occupied. A very successful feature was the division
of the lower floor into rooms for the display and sale of different kinds of small goods, each
having a room of its own. This was a new thing on the coast and was fully appreciated by the
large number of patrons who took advantage of the opportunity to try instruments in comparative
seclusion. In 1904 the largest holder of stock, Mr. Roy Mauvais, who was actively engaged in looking
after the interests of the firm desired to concentrate his energies in furthering other lines of business
in which he had engaged, and found more congenial. At this time an offer from the Wiley B.
Allen Co. to purchase the entire stock of pianos, organs and piano players was accepted, and
in accordance with the conditions of the sale the stock of small goods, sheet music and books was
moved to 933 Market street, in the room adjoining the piano warerooms of the Allen Company and
there handled under the name of the Zeno Mauvais Music Co. until the fire of April, 1906, obliterated
all traces of it. It was not considered advisable by the stockholders to re-establish the
business after this unfortunate occurrence and so one of the best and most favorably known
music houses of the Pacific Coast ceased to exist.

I will close my chapter with the story of the Zeno Mauvais Company. My story deals only with early
history, for it would not be possible for me to give any accurate account of the business except
from 1851 to 1877. I moved away from San Francisco twice and as my work was upon different lines, I
got out of touch. My music was confined to the churches and concert halls and teaching in music
and art and other branches of industrial development for the young of our growing city. I am indebted
to my good musical friends of earlier days for much of this knowledge.

When my earlier co-workers in music heard that I was to write about
our early days they were all interested and entered into the proposition
with unabated enthusiasm and not one has refused to give me information
to make this volume a souvenir of the days when we began as factors
in the development of music from the small beginnings of 1850 to the
solid foundations of today.

CHAPTER TEN

AS A CHURCH CHOIR SINGER. BARNABEE, ZERRAHN, PATTI, JENNY LIND, JOE MAGUIRE, SAM MAYER, HARRY
GATES

My career as a church singer dates as far back as my childhood. As children our father pressed
us into the service of the Sabbath school and church services. There were seven girls and three boys.
As soon as we were old enough to do the work, our parts were assigned to us, consequently singing
the church service was part of my young life. Before I could read the notes I was able to make
an alto part to almost any hymn. That is one reason why I do not read notes as readily as others,
for it was easier for me to make my own part than take the trouble to read the music. But later
on I was obliged to read my part, if I sang in concert with others.

We moved from Illinois and settled in Cincinnati in 1845. My father was the founder of the Betts
Street First German Reformed Church and was its pastor for seven years. During that time I sang
each Sabbath. When father came to California and another pastor occupied the pulpit, we were
obliged to give up the parsonage.

Other arrangements were made for the music and my sister Mary became the organist of the old
Sixth Street Presbyterian Church and Mr. Charles Aiken, director of the music. By accident
I went with my sister Mary and sat in the choir loft. Mr. Aiken noticed my presence and recognized
me as one of his pupils in the public school where he taught the singing during the week.
Surprised at seeing me he asked how I happened to come into the choir. I told him I was with
my sister, Miss Kroh, "Ah," he replied, and smiled and left me. I saw him in conversation after she
had finished her voluntary. When she was seated beside me she said, "Maggie, when the choir arises
to sing go over and stand with the altos and sing with them." When the time came she gave me
the music and I sang my first service when I was ten years old, in a double quartette and in
that capacity I sang for five years, each service, until 1850, the latter part of the year,
when father had arrived in California and sent the gold for us to follow him to the golden land,
as he called it.

At the time of our arrival in California there were no choirs or singers in San Joaquin county.
There was one Catholic church in Stockton but it was only a mission and the worshippers were
Spanish and Mexicans, priest, Father Mauritz. Our family was the first white family in the city
of Stockton, there being only one white woman in the place and she
was the wife of Rev. James Woods.

Gladly she received us and we were made welcome at her home for two
weeks before we were able to see father, who had been sick in Scorpion
Gulch for some time and we were obliged to await his coming.

After the arrival of our father it was planned that a choir should
be established in the First Presbyterian Church of which Rev. Mr.
Woods was pastor.

We had all the female voices needed. We had made the acquaintance of several of the prominent
men in Stockton who were fortunately also singers, and they readily consented to sing as members
of the choir. What was to be done for music? There was nothing to be had in Stockton. There were
two music stores in San Francisco and the first task was to supply an instrument, if possible.
Fortune favored us and between the joint efforts of these musical
people we obtained a good sized Mason and Hamlin melodeon, which was
duly installed into the choir of the church.

The choir members were as follows: Sopranos: Miss Emma Jane Kroh, Miss Sarah Rebecca Kroh;
Altos: Miss Mary M. Kroh, Miss Margaret R. Kroh; Tenors: Wm. W. Trembly, Henry Noel, George H.
Blake; Bass: Wm. H. Knight, James Holmes, Wm. Belding; Organist,
Miss Mary M. Kroh.

These men and women were the original members of the first choir that had its beginning in Stockton,
in 1851. During the years of 1853 and later, the men who had families in the Eastern cities arranged
for their coming and not many months elapsed before we had a goodly number of splendid ladies,
the wives of these men, and some children and young maidens. Quite a colony of musical folks
sprang up. They took an interest in the different choirs that had been formed. There were the Episcopal,
Methodist and Baptist missions, begun during this time, and they had their followers and formed
their musical services as soon as they were able to procure singers.

During this time there came to Stockton from New York, Mr. Henry B. Underhill. He was not only
a fine organist but an organ builder. He at once joined our colony of musicians and we rejoiced
in the addition of a second organist to rely upon. Up to this time my sister was the only available
musician that could be called upon to play on all occasions where music was needed. The Episcopal
mission of which Rev. E.W. Hager was rector, desired my sister as organist for his service
which was held in one of the large rooms of the city hall.

As Mr. Underhill was a member of the Presbyterian faith and desired to help the church they
exchanged places. The choir had grown rapidly, some of the singers were Episcopalians who preferred
their own service and all was amicably settled with the result that Stockton could boast of
two choirs and two organs, or melodeons.

It was not many years before each mission had built a church of its own with separate organs
and choirs. During these years I was sent to the Benicia Seminary, the only available school
in the state, to finish my education which had been interrupted when I left Cincinnati to come
west. Miss Atkins worshiped in the Presbyterian church, Rev. Sylvester
Woodbridge, pastor, and his daughter, Miss Mary Emma Woodbridge, organist.
She also attended the seminary and those of the pupils who could sing
were invited into the choir. I was one that was chosen on the alto
side to help in the worship. After singing here for a year, Miss Atkins
joined the Episcopal church and was confirmed and baptised in that
faith by Bishop Wm. Ingraham Kip, D.D. I sang a special song at that
time. I was now eighteen years old and was in the last year of my
school days. After leaving school I returned to Stockton where I again
joined the Episcopal choir--St. John's--and sang until I was married,
September 17, 1857, to George H. Blake, Rev. E.W. Hager, rector, reading
the service. It certainly is a hard proposition,
and it puts one upon his mettle to accept it.

Should we not find equal difficulty in believing the life-history of each one of us,--the start
in the germ, then the vague suggestion of fish, and frog, and reptile, in our foetal life,--were
it not a matter of daily experience? Let it be granted that the race of man was born as literally
out of the animal forms below him as the child is born out of these vague, prenatal animal
forms in its mother's womb. Yet the former fact so far transcends our experience, and even
our power of imagination, that we can receive it only by an act of scientific faith, as our
fathers received the dogmas of the Church by an act of religious faith.

I confess that I find it hard work to get on intimate terms with evolution, familiarize my
mind with it, and make it thinkable. The gulf that separates man from the orders below him
is so impassable, his intelligence is so radically different from theirs, and his progress
so enormous, while they have stood still, that believing it is like believing a miracle. That
the apparently blind groping and experimentation which mark the course of evolution as revealed
by palaeontology--the waste, the delay, the vicissitudes, the hit-and-miss method--should have
finally resulted in this supreme animal, man, puts our scientific faith to the test. In the
light of evolution how the halo with which we have surrounded our origin vanishes!

Man has from the earliest period believed himself of divine origin, and by the divine he has
meant something far removed from this earth and all its laws and processes, something quite
transcending the mundane forces. He has invented or dreamed myths and legends to throw the
halo of the exceptional, the far removed, the mystical, or the divine around his origin. He
has spurned the clod with his foot; he has denied all kinship with bird and beast around him,
and looked to the heavens above for the sources of his life. And then unpitying science comes
along and tells him that he is under the same law as the life he treads under foot, and that
that law is adequate to transform the worm into the man; that he, too, has groveled in the
dust, or wallowed in the slime, or fought and reveled, a reptile among reptiles; that the heavens
above him, to which he turns with such awe and reverence, or such dread and foreboding, are
the source of his life and hope in no other sense than they are the source of the life and
hope of all other creatures. But this is the way of science; it enhances the value or significance
of everything about us that we are wont to treat as cheap or vulgar, and it discounts the value
of the things far off upon which we have laid such stress. It ties us to the earth, it calls
in the messengers we send forth into the unknown; it makes the astonishing revelation-- revolutionary
revelation, I may say--that the earth is embosomed in the infinite heavens the same as the
stars that shine above us, that the creative energy is working now and here underfoot, the
same as in the ages of myth and miracle; in other words, that God is really immanent in his
universe, and inseparable from it; that we have been in heaven and under the celestial laws
all our lives, and knew it not. Science thus kills religion, poetry, and romance only so far
as it dispels our illusions and brings us back from the imaginary to the common and the near
at hand. It discounts heaven in favor of earth. It should make us more at home in the world,
and more conscious of the daily beauty and wonders that surround us, and, if it does not, the
trouble is probably in the ages of myth and fable that lie behind us and that have left their
intoxicating influence in our blood.

We are willing to be made out of the dust of the earth when God makes us, the God we have made
ourselves out of our dreams and fears and aspirations, but we are not willing to be made out
of the dust of the earth when the god called Evolution makes us. An impersonal law or process
we cannot revere or fear or worship or exalt; we can only study it and put it to the test.
We can love or worship only personality. This is why science puts such a damper upon us; it
banishes personality, as we have heretofore conceived it, from the universe. The thunder is
no longer the voice of God, the earth is no longer his footstool. Personality appears only
in man; the universe is not inhuman, but unhuman. It is this discovery that we recoil from,
and blame science for; and until, in the process of time, we shall have adjusted our minds,
and especially our emotions, to it, mankind will still recoil from it.

We love our dreams, our imaginings, as we love a prospect before our houses. We love an outlook
into the ideal, the unknown in our lives. But we love also to feel the solid ground beneath
our feet.

Whether life loses in charm as we lose our illusions, and whether it gains in power and satisfaction
as we more and more reach solid ground in our beliefs, is a question that will be answered
differently by different persons.

We have vastly more solid knowledge about the universe amid which we live than had our fathers,
but are we happier, better, stronger? May it not be said that our lives consist, not in the
number of things we know any more than in the number of things we possess, but in the things
we love, in the depth and sincerity of our emotions, and in the elevation of our aspirations?
Has not science also enlarged the sphere of our love, and given us new grounds for wonder and
admiration? It certainly has, but it as certainly has put a damper upon our awe, our reverence,
our veneration. However valuable these emotions are, and whatever part they may have played
in the development of character in the past, they seem doomed to play less and less part in
the future. Poetry and religion, so called, seem doomed to play less and less part in the life
of the race in the future. We shall still dream and aspire, but we shall not tremble and worship
as in the past.

We see about us daily transformations as stupendous as that of the evolution of man from the
lower animals, and we marvel not. We see the inorganic pass into the organic, we see iron and
lime and potash and silex blush in the flowers, sweeten in the fruit, ripen in the grain, crimson
in the blood, and we marvel not. We see the spotless pond-lily rising and unfolding its snowy
petals, and its trembling heart of gold, from the black slime of the pond. We contemplate our
own life-history as shown in our pre-natal life, and we are not disturbed. But when we stretch
this process out through the geologic ages and try to see ourselves a germ, a fish, a reptile,
in the womb of time, we are balked. We do not see the great mother, or the great father, or
feel the lift of the great biologic laws. We are beyond our depth. It is easy to believe that
the baby is born of woman, because it is a matter of daily experience, but it is not easy to
believe that man is born of the animal world below him, and that that is born of inorganic
Nature, because the fact is too big and tremendous.

What we call Nature works in no other way; one law is over big and little alike. What Nature
does in a day typifies what she does in an eternity. It is when we reach the things done on
such an enormous scale of time and power and size that we are helpless. The almost infinitely
slow transformations that the theory of evolution demands balk us as do the size and distance
of the fixed stars.

No observation or study of evolution on a small scale and near at hand in the familiar facts
of the life about us can prepare us for it, any more than lake and river can prepare us for
the ocean, or the modeling of miniature valleys and mountains by the rain in the clay bank
can open our minds to receive the tremendous facts of the carving of the face of the continent
by the same agents.

We do not see evolution working in one day, or in a century, or in many centuries. Neither
do we catch the gods of erosion at their Herculean tasks. They always seem to be having a holiday,
or else to be merely toying with their work.

When we see a mound of earth or a bank of clay worn into miniature mountain-chains and canons
and gulches by the rains of a season, we do not doubt our eyes; we know the rains did it. But
when we see the same thing copied in a broad landscape, or on the face of a state or a continent,
we find it hard to believe the evidence of our own senses. The scale upon which it is done,
and the time involved, put it so far beyond the sphere of our experience that something in
us, probably the practical, everyday man, refuses to be convinced.

The lay mind can hardly have any adequate conception of the part erosion, the simple weathering
of the rocks, has played in shaping our landscapes, and in preparing the earth for the abode
of man. The changes in the surface of the land in one's lifetime, or even in the historic period,
are so slight that the tales the geologists tell us are incredible.

When, during a recent trip through the great Southwest, I saw the earth laid open by erosion
as I had never before dreamed of, especially when I visited those halls of the gods, the Grand
Canon and Yosemite Valley, I found my capacity to believe in the erosive power of water and
the weather quite overtaxed. It must be true, I said, what the geologists tell us, that water
and air did all this; but while you look and wait, and while generations before you have looked
and waited, all is as quiet and passive as if the slumber of ages wrapped hill and vale. Invisible
giants have wrought and delved here of whom we never catch a glimpse, nor shall we, wait and
watch we never so long. No sound of their hammers or picks or shovels or of the dynamite ever
breaks the stillness of the air.

I have to believe that the valleys and mountains of my native Catskills were carved out of
a great elevated plain or plateau; there is no other explanation of them. Here lie the level
strata, without any bending or folding, or sign of convulsion and upheavals, horizontal as
the surface of the sea or lake in which their sediments were originally laid down; and here
are these deep, wide valleys cut down through these many sheets of stratified rock; and here
are these long, high, broad-backed mountains, made up of the rock that the forces of air and
water have left, and with no forces of erosion at work that would appreciably alter a line
of the landscape in ten thousand years; and yet we know, if we know anything about the physical
history of the earth, that erosion has done this work, carved out these mountains and valleys,
from the Devonian strata, as literally as the sculptor carves his statue from the block of marble.

Above my lodge on the home farm the vast layers of the gray, thin-sheeted Catskill rock crop
out and look across the valley to their fellows two or more miles away where they crop out
in a similar manner on the opposite slope of the mountain. With the eye of faith I see the
great sheets restored, and follow them across on the line which they made aeons ago, till they
are joined again to their fellows as they were before the agents of erosion had so widely severed
them.

These physical forces have worked as slowly and silently in sculpturing the landscapes as the
biological laws have worked in evolving man from the lower animals, or the vertebrates from
the invertebrates. The rains, the dews, the snows, the winds--how could these soft, gently
careering agents have demolished these rocks and dug these valleys? One would almost as soon
expect the wings and feet of the birds to wear away the forests they flit through. The wings
of time are feathered also, and as they brush against the granite or the flinty sandstone no
visible particle is removed while you watch and wait. Come back in a thousand years, and you
note no change, save in the covering of trees and verdure. Return in ten thousand, and you
would probably find the hills carrying their heads as high and as proudly as ever. Here and
there the face of the cliff may have given way, or a talus slid into the valley, or a stream
or river changed its course, or sawed deeper into the rock, and a lake been turned into a marsh,
or the delta of a river broadened--minor changes, such as a shingle from your roof or a brick
from your chimney, while your house stands as before. In one hundred thousand years what changes
should we probably find? Here in the Catskills, where I write, the weathering of the hills
and mountains would probably have been but slight. It must be fifty thousand years or more
since the great ice-sheet left us. Where protected by a thin coat of soil, its scratches and
grooves upon the surface rock are about as fresh and distinct as you may see them made in Alaska
at the present time. Where the rock is exposed, they have weathered out, one eighth of an inch
probably having been worn away. The drifting of the withered leaves of autumn, or of the snows
of winter over them, it really seems, would have done as much in that stretch of time. Then
try to fancy the eternity it has taken the subaerial elements to cut thousands of feet through
this hard Catskill sandstone! No, the evolution of the landscape, the evolution of the animal
and vegetable kingdoms, the evolution of the suns and planets, involve a process so slow, and
on such a scale, that it is quite unthinkable. How long it took evolution to bridge the chasm
between the vertebrate and the invertebrate, between the fish and the frog, between the frog
and the reptile, between the reptile and the mammal, or between the lowest mammal and the highest,
who can guess?

But the gulf has been passed, and here we are in this teeming world of life and beauty, with
a terrible past behind us, but a brighter and brighter future before us.

"THE WORM STRIVING TO BE MAN"

When our minds have expanded sufficiently to take in and accept the theory of evolution, with
what different feelings we look upon the visible universe from those with which our fathers
looked upon it! Evolution makes the universe alive. In its light we see that mysterious potency
of matter itself, that something in the clod under foot that justifies Emerson's audacious
line of the "worm striving to be man." We are no longer the adopted children of the earth,
but her own real offspring. Evolution puts astronomy and geology in our blood and authenticates
us and gives us the backing of the whole solar system. This is the redemption of the earth:
it is the spiritualization of matter.

In imagination stand off in vacant space and see the earth rolling by you, a huge bubble with
all its continents and seas and changing seasons and countless forms of life upon it, and remember
that you are looking upon a great cosmic organism, pulsing with the vital currents of the universe,
and that what it holds of living forms were not arbitrarily imposed upon it from without, but
vitally evolved from within and that man himself is one of its products as literally as are
the trees that stand rooted to the soil. Revert to the time when life was not, when the globe
was a half-incandescent ball, or when it was a seething, weltering waste of heated water, before
the land had yet emerged from the waves, and yet you and I were there in the latent potencies
of the chemically and dynamically warring elements. We were there, the same as the heat and
flame are in the coal and wood and as the explosive force of powder is in the grains. The creative
cosmic chemistry in due time brought us forth, and started us on the long road that led from
the amoeba up to man. There have been no days of creation. Creation has been a continuous process,
and the creator has been this principle of evolution inherent in all matter.

Man himself was born of this principle. His genealogy finally runs back to the clod under his
feet. One has no trouble in accepting the old Biblical account of his origin from the dust
of the earth when one views that dust in the light of modern science.

Man is undoubtedly of animal origin. He is embraced in the same zoological scheme as are all
other creatures, and did not start as man any more than you and I started with our present
stature, or than the earth sprang from chaos as we now behold it.

His complete physical evolution must have been achieved thousands of centuries ago, but his
full mental and spiritual evolution is not yet.

I think of his physical evolution as completed when he assumed the upright attitude or passed
from a quadruped to a biped, which must of itself have been a long, slow process. Probably
our whole historic period would form but a fraction of this cycle of unrecorded time. Man's
complete emergence from the lower orders, so that he stood off in sharp contrast to them in
his physical form probably occurred in later Tertiary times, and what the meaning of this stretch
of time is in human years we can only conjecture. During this cycle of numberless millenniums
till the dawn of history, man's development was mainly mental. He left the brute creature behind
because his mind continued to develop after his physical form was complete, while the brute
stood still. Whence the impulse that sent man forward? Why was one animal form endowed with
the capacity for endless growth and development, and all the others denied it? Ah! that is
the question of questions. Compared with the development of his bodily powers, man's mental
and spiritual growth has been very rapid. He seems to have been millions of years in getting
his body, while he has been only millenniums in getting his reason and intelligence. What progress
since the dawn of history! Compare the Germans of the time of Tacitus, or the Gauls of the
time of Caesar, or the Britons of the time of Hadrian with the people of those countries to-day.

We are prone to speak of man's emergence from the lower orders as if it were a simple thing,
almost like the going from one country into another. But try to think what it means; try to
think of the slow transformation, of the long, toilsome road even from the halfway house of
our simian ancestors. If we do not give him the benefit of the sudden mutation theory of the
origin of species, then think of the slow process, hair by hair, as it were, by which a tailed,
apelike arboreal animal was transformed into a hairless, tailless, erect, tool-using, fire-using,
speech-forming animal. We see in our own day in the case of the African negro, that centuries
of our Northern climate have hardly any appreciable effect toward making a white man of him;
nor, on the other hand, has exposure to the tropical sun had much more effect in making a negro
of the white man. Probably it would take ten thousand years or more of these conditions to
bleach the pigments out of the one skin and put them in the other. There is convincing proof
from painting and figures found in Egypt that neither the African negro nor the Egyptian has
changed in features in five thousand years.

The most marvelous thing about man's evolution is the inborn upward impulse in some one low
organism that rested not till it reached its goal in him. The mollusk remains, but some impulse
went out from the mollusk that begat the fish. The fish remains, but some impulse went out
from the fish that begat the amphibian. The amphibian remains, but some impulse went out from
the amphibian that begat the reptile. The reptile remains, but some impulse went out from the
reptile that begat the mammal; and so on up to man. Man must have had a specific line of descent.
One golden thread must connect him with the lowest forms of life. And the wonder is that this
golden thread was never snapped or lost through all the terrible vicissitudes of the geologic
ages. But I suppose it is just as great a wonder that the line of descent of the horse, or
the sheep, or the dog, or the bird, was not snapped or lost. Some impulse or tendency was latent
or potential in the first unicellular life that rested not till it eventuated in each of these
higher forms. Did any terrestrial or celestial calamity endanger the line of descent of any
of the higher creatures? Was any form cut off in the world-wide crustal disturbances of the
earth at the end of palaeozoic and mesozoic time, when so many forms of animal life appear
to have been wiped out, that might in time have given birth to a kind unlike or superior to
any now upon the earth? Species after species have become extinct, whole orders and families
have gone out, often rather suddenly. Why we know not. Why the line of man's descent was not
cut off, who knows? It is a vain speculation. There can be little doubt that in early Tertiary
times our ancestor was a small, feeble mammal, maybe of the lemur, maybe of the marsupial kind,
powerless before the great carnivorous mammals of that time, and probably escaping them by
his greater agility, perhaps by his arboreal habits. The ancestor of the horse was also a small
creature at that time, not larger than a fox. It was not cut off; the line of descent seems
complete to the horse of our day. Small beginnings seem to be the rule in all provinces of
life. There is little doubt that the great animals of our day--the elephant, the whale, the
lion,--all had their start in small forms. Many of these small forms have been found. But a
complete series of any of the animal forms that eventuated in any of the dominant species is
yet wanting. It is quite certain that the huge, the gigantic, the monstrous in animal, as in
vegetable life, lies far behind us. Is it not quite certain that evolution in the life of the
globe has run its course, and that it will not again bring forth reptiles or mammals of the
terrible proportions of those of past geologic ages? nor ferns, nor mosses, nor as gigantic
trees as those of Carboniferous times? Probably the redwoods of the Far West, the gigantic
sequoias, are the last race of gigantic trees. The tide of life of the globe is undoubtedly
at the full. The flood has no doubt been checked many times. The glacial periods, of which
there seem to have been several in different parts of the earth, and in different geological
periods, no doubt checked it when it occurred. But the tide as a whole must have steadily risen,
because the progression from lower to higher forms has gone steadily forward. The lower forms
have come along; Nature has left nothing behind. The radiates, the articulates, the mollusca,
are still with us, but in the midst of these the higher and higher forms have been constantly
appearing. The great biological tree has got its growth. Many branches and twigs have died
and dropped off, and many more will do so, are doing so before our eyes, but I cannot help
doubting that any new branches of importance are yet to appear--any new families or orders
of birds, or fishes, or reptiles, or mammals. The horse, the stag, the sheep, the dog, the
cat, as we know them, are doubtless the end of the series. One arrives at this conclusion upon
general principles. Life as a whole must run its course or reach its high-water mark, the same
as life in its particular phases. Man has arrived and has universal dominion; all things are
put under his feet. The destiny of life upon the globe is henceforth largely in his hands.
Not even he can avert the final cosmic catastrophe which physicists foresee, and which, according
to Professor Lowell, the beings upon Mars are now struggling to ward off.

Man has taken his chances in the clash of forces of the physical universe. No favor has been
shown him, or is shown him to-day, and yet he has come to his estate. He has never been coddled;
fire, water, frost, gravity, hunger, death, have made and still make no exceptions in his favor.
He is on a level with all other animals in this respect. He has his life and well-being on
the same terms as do the fowls of the air and the beasts of the fields.

Archbishop Whately thought that primitive man could never have raised himself to a higher condition
without external aid--some "elementary instruction to enable his faculties to begin their work."
He must have had a boost. Well, the boost was forthcoming, but it was not from without, but
from within, through this principle of development, this upward striving that was innate from
the first in certain forms of life and of which Whately had no conception. It was the conception
of his time that creation was like a watch made and wound up by some power external to itself.

The physical evolution of man, as I have said, is no doubt complete. He will never have wings,
or more legs, or longer arms, or a bigger brain. The wings and the extra legs and the keener
sense he has left behind him. His development henceforth must be in the mental and spiritual.
He is bound to have more and more dominion over Nature, and see more and more clearly his own
relation to her. He will in time completely subdue and possess the earth. Yes, and probably
exhaust her? But he will see in time that he is squandering his inheritance and will mend his
ways. He will conserve in the future as he has wasted in the past. He will learn to conserve
his own health. He will banish disease; he will stamp out all the plagues and scourges, through
his scientific knowledge; he will double or treble the length of life. Man has undoubtedly
passed through and finished certain phases of his emotional and mental development. He will
never again be the religious enthusiast and fanatic he has been in the past; he has not worshiped
his last, but he has worshiped his best. He will build no more cathedrals; he will burn no
more martyrs at the stake. His religion as such is on the wane. But his humanitarianism is
a rising tide. He is becoming less and less a savage, revolts more and more at the sight of
blood and suffering. The highly religious ages were ages of blood and persecution. Man's tenderness
for man has vastly increased. The sense of the sacredness of human life has increased as his
faith in his gods has declined. He has grown more human as he has grown less superstitious.
Science has atrophied his faith, but it has softened his heart. His fear of Nature has given
place to love. Man never loved as he does now. He has withdrawn his gaze from heaven and fixed
it upon the earth. As his interest in other worlds has diminished, his interest in this has
increased. As the angels have departed, the children have come in.

When the nations, too, cease to be savage and selfish, and become altruistic, then the new
birth of humanity will actually have occurred. As an artist and a creator of beautiful forms,
man has also had his day; he loved the beautiful, the artistic, or the ornamental long before
he loved the true and the just. He was proud before he was kind; he was chivalrous before he
was decent; he was tattooed before he was washed; he was painted before he was clothed; he
built temples before he built a home; he sacrificed to his gods before he helped his neighbor;
he was heroic before he was self-denying; he was devout before he was charitable. We are losing
the savage virtues and vanities and growing in the grace of all the humanities, and this process
will doubtless go on, with many interruptions and setbacks of course, till the kingdom of love
is at last fairly established upon the earth.

XI

THE PHANTOMS BEHIND US

I

I take the title of this paper from those great lines in Whitman beginning--

"Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me"--

in which he launches in vivid imaginative form the whole doctrine of evolution some years before
Darwin had published his epoch-making work on the "Origin of Species."

"I see afar down the huge first Nothing, and I know I was even there."

I do not know that Whitman had any concrete belief in the truth of the animal origin of man.
He read as picture and parable that which the man of science reads as demonstrable fact. He
saw and felt the great truth of evolution, but he saw it as written in his own heart and not
in the great stone book of the earth, and he saw it written large. He felt its cosmic truth,
its truth in relation to the whole scheme of things; he felt his own kinship with all that
lives, and had a vivid personal sense of his debt to the past, not only of human history, but
also to the past of the earth and the spheres. And he felt this as a poet and not as a man
of science.

The theory of evolution as applied to the whole universe and its inevitable corollary, the
animal origin of man, is now well established in most of the leading minds of the world, but
it is still rejected by many timid and sensitive souls, and it will be a long time before it
becomes universally accepted.

Doubtless one source of the trouble we have in accepting the theory comes from the fact that
our minds have not been used to such thoughts; in the mind of the race they are a new thing:
they are not in the literature nor in the philosophy nor in the sacred books in which our minds
have been nurtured; they are of yesterday; they came to us raw and unhallowed by the usage
of ages; more than that, they savor of the materialism of all modern science, which is so distasteful
to our finer ideals and religious sensibilities. In fact, these ideas are strangers of an alien
race in our intellectual household, and we look upon them coldly and distrustfully. But probably
to our children, or to our children's children, they will wear quite a different countenance;
they will have become an accepted part of the great family of ideas of the race.

Another hindrance is the dullness and opacity of our own minds. We are slow to wake up to a
sense of the divinity that hedges us about. The great office of science has been to show us
this universe as much more wonderful and divine than we have been wont to believe; shot through
and through with celestial laws and forces; matter, indeed, but matter informed with spirit
and intelligence; the creative energy inherent and active in the ground underfoot not less
than in the stars and nebulae overhead.

We look for the divine afar off. We gaze upon the beauty and purity of the heavenly bodies
without thinking that we are also in the heavens. We must open our minds to the stupendous
fact that God is immanent in his universe and that it is literally and exactly true, as we
were taught long ago, that, during every moment of our lives, in Him we live and move and have
our being.

Moreover, we are staggered by the element of vast time that is implied in the history of development.
Were it not for the records in the rocks, we could not believe it at all. All the grand movements
and processes of nature are quite beyond our ken. In the heavens only the astronomer with his
prisms and telescopes traces them; only the geologist and palaeontologist read their history
in the earth's crust. The soil we cultivate was once solid rock, but not in one lifetime, not
in many lifetimes, do we see the transformation of the rocks into soil. Nations may rise and
fall, and the rocks they looked upon and the soil they tilled remain practically unchanged.
Geologists talk about the ancient continents that have passed away. What an abyss of time such
things open! They talk about the birth of a mountain or the decay of a mountain as we talk
of the birth and death of a man, but in doing so they reckon with periods of time for which
we have no standards of measurement. They walk and talk with the Eternal. To us the mountains
seem as fixed as the stars. But the stars, too, are flitting. Look at Orion some millions of
years hence, and he will have been torn limb from limb. The combination of stars that forms
that striking constellation and all other constellations is temporary as the grouping of the
clouds. The rise of man from the lower orders implies a scale of time almost as great. It is
unintelligible to us because it belongs to a category of facts that transcends our experience
and the experience of the race as the interstellar spaces transcend our earthly measurements.

We now gaze upon the order below us across an impassable gulf, but that gulf we have crossed
and without any supernatural means of transportation. We may say it has been bridged or filled
with the humble ancestral forms that carried forward the precious evolutionary impulse of the
vertebrate series till it culminated in man. All vestiges of that living bridge are now gone,
and the legend of our crossing seems like a dream or a miracle. Biological evolution has gone
hand in hand with geological evolution, and both are on a scale of time of which our hour-glass
of the centuries gives us but a faint hint. Our notions of time are not formed on the pattern
of the cosmic processes, or the geologic processes, or the evolutionary processes; they are
formed on the pattern of our own brief span of life. In a few cases in the familiar life about
us we see the evolutionary process abridged, and transformations like those of unrecorded time
take place before our eyes, as when the tadpole becomes the frog or the grub becomes the butterfly.
These rapid changes are analogous to those which in the depths of geologic time have evolved
the bird from the fish or the reptile, or the seal and the manatee from a fourfooted land animal.
Our common bluebird has long been recognized as a descendant of the thrush family; this origin
is evident in the speckled breast of the young birds and in the voices of the mature birds.
I have heard a bluebird with an unmistakable thrush note. The transformation has doubtless
been so slow that an analogous change taking place in any of the bird forms of our own time
would entirely escape observation. The bluebird may have been as long in getting his blue coat
as man has been in getting his upright position.

Looking into the laws and processes of the common nature about us for clues to the origin of
man is not unlike looking into the records of the phonograph for the secret of the music which
that wonderful instrument voices for us. Something, some active principle or agent, has to
invoke the music that slumbers or is latent in these lines.

In like manner some principle or force that we do not see is active in the ground underfoot
and in the forms of life about us which is the final secret of the origin of man and of all
other creatures. This something is the evolutionary impulse, this innate aspiration of living
matter to reach higher and higher forms. "Urge and urge," says Whitman, "always the procreant
urge of the world." It is in Emerson's worm "striving to be man." This "striving" pervades
organic nature. Whence its origin science does not assume to say. [Footnote: This passage was
written long before I had read Bergson's Creative Evolution, as were several others of the
same import in this volume.]

Then the difference in kind between the mind of man and that of the lower orders makes evolution
a doubly hard problem.

Look over the globe and see what a gulf separates man from all other creatures. All the other
animals seem akin--as if the product of the same workman. Man, in contrast, seems like an introduction
from some other sphere or the outcome of quite other psychological laws; his dominion over
them all is so complete and universal. Without their specialization of structure or powers,
he yet masters them all and uses them; without their powers of speed, he yet outstrips them;
without their strength of tusk and limb, he yet subdues them; without their inerrant instinct,
he yet outwits them; without their keenness of eye, ear, and nose, he yet wins in the chase;
without their special adaptation to environment, he survives when they perish. A man is marked
off from the animals below him, I say, as if he were a being of another sphere. He looks into
their eyes and they into his, and no recognition passes; and yet we have to believe that he
and they are fruit of the same biologic tree and that their stem forms unite in the same trunk
somewhere in the abyss of biologic time.

The rise of man from the lower orders taxes our powers of belief and our faith in the divinity
that lurks underfoot far more than did the special creation myth. Creation by omnipotent fiat
seems easy when you have the omnipotent being to begin with, but creation through evolution
is a kind of cosmic or biologic legerdemain that baffles and bewilders us. It so far transcends
all our earthly knowledge and experience and all the flights of our philosophy that we stand
speechless before it. It opens a gulf that the imagination cannot clear; it opens vistas from
which we instinctively shrink; it opens up abysms of time in which our whole historic period
would be but a day; it opens up a world of struggle, delay, waste, failure that palls the imagination.
It challenges our faith in the immanency and in the ceaseless activity of God in his world;
it brings the creative energy down from its celestial abode and clothes it with the flesh and
blood of animal life. It may chill and shock us; it shows us that we are of the earth earthy;
yea, that we are of the animal beastly; it presses us down in matter; it puts out the lights
to which we have so long turned as lighting our origin; the words "sacred," "divine," "holy,"
and "celestial," as applied to our origin and development, we have no longer any use for, nor
for any words or ideas that set us apart from the rest of creation--above it in our origin
or apart from it in our relations. The atmosphere of mystery and miracle and sanctity that
our religious training has thrown around our introduction upon this planet and around our relations
and destiny science dispels. Our language and many of our ideas and habits of thought date
back to pre-scientific times--when there were two worlds, the heavenly and the earthly, separated
by a gulf. Now we know that the two worlds are one, that they are inseparably blended; that
the celestial and the terrestrial are under the same law; that we can never be any more in
the heavens than we are here and now, nor any nearer the final sources of life and power; that
the divine is underfoot as well as overhead; that we are part and parcel of the physical universe,
and take our chances in the cosmic processes the same as the rest, and draw upon the same fund
of animal life that the other creatures do. We are identified with the worm underfoot no less
than with the stars overhead. We are not degraded by such a thought, but the whole of creation
is lifted up. Our minds and bodies are not less divine, but all things are more divine. We
have to gird up our loins and try to summon strength to see this tremendous universe as it
is, alive and divine to the last particle and embosomed in the Infinite.

II

Evolution is not the final explanation of the universe, but it is probably the largest generalization
of the modern mind. Science has to start somewhere, and it starts with the universe as it finds
it and seeks to trace secondary or proximate causes; the evolutionist seeks to trace the footsteps
of creative energy in the world of animal life. How did God make man? Out of the dust of the
earth, says the Bible of our fathers. The evolutionist teaches essentially the same thing,
only he does not abridge the process as the catechism has abridged it for us; he would fain
unfold the whole long road that man has traveled from the first protozoic cell to the vast
communities of cells that now make up his physical life. He would show how man has risen on
stepping-stones of his dead self. These stepping-stones have been the animal forms below him.
In them and through them something, some impulse, some force, has mounted and mounted through
all the enormous lapse of geologic time. In imagination we see the dim, shadowy man, restless
and struggling in a vast number of earlier forms. He has struggled upward through the invertebrates,
through the fish, through the reptile, through the lower mammals, through his simian ancestors
till he reaches his goal in the man we know.

Darwin was not the author of the theory of evolution, but he made the theory alive and real
to the imagination. He showed us what a master key it is for unlocking the riddle of the life
of the globe. He launched biological science upon a new career and made it worthy of its place
in the great trilogy of sciences, astronomy, geology, and biology, of which Tennyson, in his
poem "Parnassus," recognized only the first two. Had Tennyson written his poem in our day he
would undoubtedly have included biology among his "terrible Muses" that tower above all others,
eclipsing the glory of the great poets. Or is it true that we find it easier to accept the
theory of the evolution of the worlds and suns from nebulous matter than to accept the theory
of the evolution of man from the maze of the lower animal forms? It is less personal to us.
The astronomer has the advantage of the biologist in one important respect: he can show us
in the heavens now the process of the evolution of worlds actually going on, but the biologist
cannot show us the transformation of one species into another taking place to-day. We can sound
the abysses of astronomic space easier than we can sound the abysses of geologic time. The
stars and the nebulae we have always with us, but where are the myriad earlier forms that were
the antecedents of the present animal life of the globe? True, the palaeontologist finds a
more or less disjointed record of them in the stratified rocks and sees in a measure the course
evolution has taken, but he does not actually see it at work as does the astronomer. More than
that, the forces the astronomer deals with are mechanical and chemical, but the biologist deals
with a new force called life that often reverses or defies mechanical and chemical forces,
but which is yet so identified and blended with them that we cannot conceive it apart from
them. The stomach does not digest itself, nor gravity hold the blood in the lower extremities.
The tree lifts up its weight of fluids and solids and holds aloft its fruit and foliage in
spite of gravity; its growing roots split and lift the rocks; mosses and lichens disintegrate
granite; vital energy triumphs over chemical and mechanical energy.

Biological laws are much more subtle and difficult to trace and formulate than chemical and
mechanical laws. Hence the student of organic evolution can rarely arrive at the demonstrable
certainties in this field that he can in the sphere of chemistry and mechanics. It is very
doubtful if life can ever be explained in terms of these things. Life works through chemical
combinations and affinities, and yet is it not more than chemistry? It works with and through
mechanical principles and forces, and yet it is evidently more than mechanics. It is manifested
through matter, and yet no analysis of matter can reveal its secret. It comes and goes while
matter stays; we destroy life, but cannot destroy matter. It is as fugitive as the wind which
fills all sails one minute and is gone the next. It avails itself of fluids and gases and the
laws which govern them, but fluids and gases do not explain it. It waits upon the rains and
the dews, but it is more than they are; it follows in the footsteps of the decay and disintegration
of the inorganic, and yet it is not the gift of these things; it transforms the face of the
earth, and yet the earth has been and will be when it was not and when it will not be. Through
his knowledge and his science man performs wonders every day; he can reduce mountains to powder
and seas to dry land, but he cannot create or start de novo the least throb of life. At least,
he has not yet done so. With all his vast resources of mechanics and chemistry, and his insight
into the mechanism of the universe, he has not yet made the least particle of inorganic matter
thrill with the mysterious something we call life.

There must have been a time when life was not upon the earth and there must again come a time
when it will not be. It has probably vanished from the moon and all inferior planets, and it
has not yet come to the superior planets, except maybe to Mars. It must be and must have always
been potential in matter, but this fact leaves the mystery as profound as ever.

Yet if the artificial production of life were to happen to-day--if in some of our laboratories
living matter were produced from non-living, should we not still have to credit the event to
some mysterious potency residing in matter itself? If by a lucky stroke man were to evoke the
organic from the inorganic, be assured he would not evoke something from nothing, or add anything
to the latent possibilities of the elements with which he works. Does not the question still
remain who or what made this feat possible? One dare affirm that man cannot create life de
novo any more than he can create matter. He may yet evoke life as he evokes the spark from
the flint and the flame from the match or as he evokes force from the food he eats. In this
latter case he does not create the force; he liberates it through the vital forces of his body.
The spark from the flint and the flame from the match were called forth by a mechanical process,
but the process was set going by the will which waits upon the vital process. The body with
all its many functions is a complicated system of mechanical devices and chemical processes,
but that which is back of all and governs all is not mechanical; the body is a machine plus
something else.

The chemist or biologist who shall produce a speck of protoplasm to-day will have the credit
of unlocking a power in inorganic nature; he will prove by a short cut how immanent the creative
energy or the vital force of the universe is in matter. He will not have eliminated the creative
energy; he will only have disclosed it and availed himself of it.

We behold spontaneous combustion, a fire self-kindled, but we do not see the activity of the
particles of matter that preceded it or penetrate the secret of their mysterious affinities.
The fire was potential there in the very constitution of the elements. We flout at miracles,
and then we disclose an unending miracle in the life about us.

All the life upon the globe, including man with all his marvelous powers, surely originated
upon the globe, surely arose out of the non-living and the non-thinking, not by the fiat of
some power external to nature, but through the creative energy inherent in nature and ever
active there. The great physical instrumentality was heat--without heat the reaction called
life could never have taken place. This fact has led a French biologist to say that life is
only a surface accident in the history of the thermic evolution of the globe. Without the disintegration
of the rocks and the formation of the soil and the precipitation of watery vapor, which was
indirectly the work of heat, the vegetable and the animal could not have developed. If we succeed
in proving that all these things are of chemico-mechanical origin, we still want to know who
or what instituted these chemical and mechanical powers and the laws that govern them. Creation
by chemistry and mechanics is as mysterious as creation by miracle. We must still have a creator,
while we can do nothing with him nor find any place for him in an endless, beginningless, infinite
series of events. So there we are. We go out of the same door by which we came in.

When all life vanishes from the earth, as it will when the condition of heat and moisture has
radically changed, and eternal refrigeration sets in--what then? The potencies of matter will
not have changed and life will reappear and go through its cycle again on some other sphere.

Life began upon this earth not by miracle in the old sense, but by miracle in the new scientific
sense--by the immanence and ceaseless activity of the creative energy in the physical world
about us--in the sunbeam, in the rains, in the snows, in the air currents, and in the soil
underfoot; in oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, in lime, iron, silex, phosphorus, and in
all the rest of them. Each has its laws, its ways, its fixed mode of procedure, its affinities,
its likes and dislikes, and life is bound up with all of them. If we hypothesize the ether
to explain certain phenomena, why should we not hypothesize a vital force to account for other
mysteries?

The inorganic passes into the organic as night passes into day. Where does one end and the
other begin? No man can tell. There is no beginning and no ending of either, and yet night
comes and goes and day comes and goes--a constant becoming and a constant ending. We are probably
in the midday of the life of the globe--life huge and rank and riotous--the youth of life has
passed, life more sedate and aspiring and spiritual has come. The gigantic has gone or is going,
the huge monsters of the sea and of the land have had their day, man appears at the end of
the series of lesser but more complete forms.

Many intelligent persons who have been rocked in the cradle of the old creeds still look upon
evolution as a godless doctrine and accuse it of vulgarizing high and sacred things. This state
of mind can only be slowly outgrown by familiarizing ourselves with the processes of nature
or of the creative energy in the world of life and matter about us; with our own origin in
the low fishlike or apelike creature in the maternal womb; with the development of every plant,
tree, and animal from a microscopic germ; with the unbroken sequence of natural law; with the
waste, the delays, the pains, the failures on every hand; with the impersonal and the impartial
character of all the physical forces; with the transformations and metamorphoses that marked
the course of animal life; and, above all, with the thought that evolution is not self-caused
or in any true sense a cause in itself, but the instrument or plan of the power that works
in and through all things. The ways of God in all these details are past finding out, but science
watches the unfolding of a bud, the development of a grain of wheat, the growth of the human
embryo, the succession of life-forms upon the globe as revealed in the records of the stratified
rocks, or observes in the heavens the condensation of nebulous matter into suns and systems,
and it says this is one of his ways. Evolution--an endless unfolding and transformation. "Urge
and urge and urge," says Whitman (I love to repeat this saying; it is so significant), "always
the procreant urge of the world." Always the labor and travail pains of the universe to bring
forth higher forms; always struggle and pain and failure and death, but always a new birth
and an upward reach.

Strike out the element of time and we see evolution as the great prestidigitator of the biologic
ages. The creative energy manipulates a fish and it turns into a reptile; it covers a mollusk
as with a vapor and behold, a backboned creature instead! Now we see a little creature no larger
than a fox and when we look again, behold the horse; a wolf or some kindred animal is plunged
into the water, and behold, the seal! Some small creature of the lemur kind is covered with
a capacious hand, and we look again, and behold man! We have only to minimize time and minimize
space to see the impossible happening all about us or to see the Mosaic account of creation
repeated; we have only the clay and water to begin with, when, presto! behold what we have
now! We see the rocks covered with verdure, the mountains vanishing into plains, the valleys
changing into hills or the plains changing into mountains, tropic lands covered with ice and snow.

Lord Salisbury thought he had discredited natural selection, which is one of the feet upon
which evolution goes, when he charged that no one had ever seen it at work. We have not seen
it at work because our little span of life is too short. Only the palaeontologist traces in
the records of the rocks the footsteps of this god of change. And rarely if ever does he find
a continuous and complete record--only a footprint here and there, but he sees the direction
in which they are going and many of the places where the traveler tarried. The palaeontologist,
that detective of the rocks, works up his case with the same thoroughness and caution and the
same power of observation as does the detective in human affairs and with a greater sweep of
scientific imagination.

An agent of evolution is the influence of the environment, but who sees the environment set
its stamp upon animal life? After many generations we may see the accumulated results. In a
few instances the results are rapid. Thus sheep lose their wool in tropical climates and a
northern fur-bearing animal its fur. The well-being of the animal demands this change, and
demands it quickly. Fish lose their sense of sight in underground streams; this loss is not
so vital and it comes about much more slowly. A tropical climate sets its stamp upon the complexion
and character of man, but this again is a slow process, as the same stress of necessity does
not exist.

In the tendency to variation--in form, size, disposition, power, fertility--man differs from
all other animals. In the same race, in the same family, we find infinitely varied types. Among
the wild creatures all the individuals of a species are practically alike. We can hardly tell
one fox, or one marmot, or one chipmunk, or one crow, or one hawk, or one black duck from another
of the same species. Of course there are slight individual differences, but they are hardly
distinguishable. Among the insects, one bee, one beetle, one ant, one butterfly seems the exact
copy of every other individual of its kind. The law of variation seems practically annulled
in the insect world.

It is the wide and free range of this law in the human species that has undoubtedly led to
the great progress of the race. There has been no dead level--no democracy of talent--no equality
of gifts, but only equality of opportunity. Men differ from one another in their mental endowments,
capacities, and dispositions vastly more than do any other creatures upon the earth. This difference
makes man's chances of progress so much the greater; he has so many more stakes in the game.
If one type of talent fails, another type may win; if the lymphatic temperament is not a success,
try the sanguine or the bilious; blue eyes and black eyes and brown eyes will win more triumphs
than blue or black or brown alone. Arms or legs extra long, sight or hearing extra sharp, wit
extra keen, judgment extra sure--all these things open doors to more progress. Variation gives
natural selection a chance to take hold, and where the struggle for life is the most severe
the changes will be the most rapid and the most radical. Without the pressure of the environment
natural selection would not select. The tendency to physical variation in man is probably no
greater than in other creatures, but his tendency to mental variation is enormous. He varies
daily from mediocrity to genius, hence the enormous range of his chances of progress. From
the first variation that started him on his way in his line of descent, variation must have
been more and more active till he varied in the direction of reason, long before the dawn of
history, since which time his progress has been by rapid strides--and more and more rapid till
we see his leaps forward in recent times. The race owes its rapid progress to its exceptional
men, its men of genius and power, and these have often been like sports or the sudden result
of mutations--a man like Lincoln springing from the humblest parentage. No such extreme variations
are seen in any of the lower orders. Indeed, in one's lifetime one sees but very slight variation
in any of the wild or domestic creatures, less in the wild than in the domestic because they
are less under the influence of that most variable of animals, man. And man's variations are
mainly mental and not physical. The higher we go in the scale of powers, the greater the variation
and hence the more rapid the evolution. Probably man's body has not changed radically in vast
cycles of time, but his mind has developed enormously since the dawn of history.

IV

Biologists are coming more and more to recognize some unknown factor in evolution, probably
some unknowable factor. The four factors of Osborn--heredity, ontogeny, environment, selection--play
upon and modify endlessly the new form when it is started, but what about the original start?
Whence comes this inborn momentum, this evolutionary send-off? What or who set the whole grand
process going?

Bergson sees an internal psychological principle of development, hence the name of his book,
"Creative Evolution." Osborn uses the word "directed." Certain characters, he says, are adaptive
or suited to their purpose from the start; they do not have to be fitted to their place by
natural selection. Huxley uses the word "predestined"--all the life of the globe and all the
starry hosts of heaven are working out in boundless space and in endless time "their predestined
course of evolution." Darwin must have had in mind the same mysterious something when he said
that man had risen to the very summit of the animal scale, but not through his own exertions.
Not by his own will or exertion, surely, any more than the embryo in its mother's womb develops
into the full-grown child by its own exertion or than our temperaments and complexions and
statures are matters of our own wills and choice. Something greater than man and before him,
to which he sustains the relation that the unborn child sustains to its mother, must enter
into our thought of his origin and development.

The great evolutionists have been very cautious about seeking to go behind evolution and name
the Primal Cause. In such an attempt science would at once be beyond soundings. Darwin and
Huxley were reverent, truth-loving men, but they hesitated as men of science to put themselves
in a position where no step could be taken.

Slowly man emerges out of the abyss of geologic time into the dawn of history, and science
gropes about like a man feeling his way in the dark or, at most, by the aid now and then of
a dim flash of light, to trace the path he has come. He has surely arrived, and we are, I believe,
safe in saying he has come by the way of the lower orders; but the precise forms through which
he has come, the houses in which he has tarried by the way, and all the adventures and vicissitudes
that befell him on the journey--can we ever hope to know these things? In any case, man has
his antecedents; life has its antecedents; every beat of one's heart has its antecedent cause,
which again has its antecedent. We can thus traverse the chain of causation only to find it
is an endless chain; the separate links we can examine, but the first link or the last we see,
by the very nature of things, and the laws of our own minds, must forever elude us. Science
cannot admit of a break in the chain of causation, cannot admit that miracles or the supernatural
in the old sense, as external and arbitrary interference with the natural order, can play or
ever have played any part in this universe. Yet science has to postulate a First Cause when
it knows, or metaphysics knows for it, that with the Infinite there can be no first and no
last, no beginning and no ending, only endless succession.

To science man is not a fallen creature, but a many times risen creature and all the good of
the universe centres in him. The mind that pervades all nature and is active in plant and animal
alike first comes to know itself and regard itself and achieve intellectual appreciation in
man. While all nature below man is wise only to its own ends and goes its appointed way as
void of self-consciousness as the stone that falls or the wind that blows, the mind of man
attains to disinterested wisdom and turns upon itself and upon the universe the power of objective
thought; it alone achieves understanding.

In our studies of life and of the universe as soon as we begin to bridge chasms by an appeal
to the miraculous, or to the extra-natural powers, we are traitors to the scientific spirit
which we seek to serve. There are many things that science cannot explain. Perhaps I may say
that it cannot give the ultimate explanation of anything. It can do little more than tell us
of the action, the interaction, and the reaction of things, but of the things themselves, their
origin and ultimate nature, or the source of the laws that govern them, what does it or what
can it know?

Man is the heir of all the geologic ages; he inherits the earth after countless generations
of animals and plants, and the beneficent forces of wind and rain, air and sky, have in the
course of millions of years prepared it for him. His body has been built for him through the
lives and struggles of the countless beings who are in the line of his long descent; his mind
is equally an accumulated inheritance of the mental growth of the myriads of thinking men and
unthinking animals that went before him. In the forms of his humbler forebears he has himself
lived and died myriads of times to make ready the soil that nurses and sustains him to-day.
He is a debtor to Cambrian and Silurian times, to the dragons and saurians and mastodons that
have roamed over the earth. Indeed, what is there or has there been in the universe that he
is not indebted to? The remotest star that shines has sent a ray that has entered into his
life. All things are under his feet, and the keys of the heavens are in his hands.

V

One would fain arrive at some concrete belief or image of his line of descent in geologic time
as he does in the historic period. But how hard it is to do so! Can we form any mental picture
of the actual animal forms that the manward impulse has traveled through? With all the light
that palaeontology throws upon the animal life of the past, can we see where amid the revel
of these bizarre forms our ancestor hid himself? Can we see him as a reptile in the slime of
the jungle or in the waters of the Mesozoic world? What was he like or what akin to? What mark
or sign was there upon him at that time of the future that was before him? Can we see him as
a fish in the old Devonian seas or lakes? Was he a big fish or a little fish? The primitive
fishes were mostly of the shark kind. Is there any connection between that fact and the human
sharks of to-day? Much less can one picture to one's self what his ancestor was like in the
age of the invertebrates, amid the trilobites, etc., of the earlier Palaeozoic seas. But we
must go back even earlier than that, back to unicellular life and to original protoplasm, and
finally back to fiery nebulous matter. What can we make of it all by way of concrete conception
of what actually took place--of the visible, eating, warring, breeding animal forms in whose
safekeeping our heritage lay? Nothing. We are not merely at sea, we are in abysmal depths,
and the darkness is so thick we can cut it.

We meet the same difficulty when we try to figure to ourselves the line of descent of any of
the animal forms of to-day. How did they escape the world-wild catastrophe of earlier geologic
times? Or did the creative impulse bank upon life as a whole and never become bankrupt, no
matter what special lines or forms failed?

The first appearance of the primates is in Eocene times and the anthropoid apes in the Miocene,
probably five millions of years ago. The form which may have been in our line of descent, the
Dryopithecus, later appears to have become extinct. Did our fate hang upon the success of any
of these forms? The monkeys and anthropoid apes appeared at the same time in different countries.
Nature seems to have been making preliminary studies of man in these various forms, but when
and where she hit upon the form that she perfected in man, who knows?

The horse appears to have been evolved in North America, true cattle in Asia, elephants in
Africa. Can we narrow their line of descent down to a single pair for each? Many forms allied
to the horse appeared in Europe and Asia in Miocene times. We find monkeys in different parts
of the world in the same geologic horizons; did they all have a common origin?

Life's apprenticeship has been a long one. The earlier forms of vertebrate life were very large;
later they became very small. Nature seems to have experimented with bulk, as if she thought
size would win in the race. Hence those huge uncouth forms among the reptiles and early mammals.
The scheme did not work well; bulk was not the thing, after all. Most of the gigantic forms
became extinct. Then she tried smaller and more agile forms with larger brains--less flesh
and more wit. On this line Nature continued to work till she produced her masterpiece in man--a
rather feeble and nearly weaponless animal, but with an intangible armory of weapons and tools
in his brain that enables him to put all creatures under his feet.

XII

THE HAZARDS OF THE PAST

I

Bergson, the new French philosopher, thinks we all had a narrow escape, back in geologic time,
of having our eggs spoiled before they were hatched, or, rather, rendered incapable of hatching
by too thick a shell. This was owing to the voracity of the early organisms. As they became
more and more mobile, they began to take on thick armors and breastplates and shells and calcareous
skins to protect themselves from one another. This tendency resulted, he thinks, in the arrest
of the entire animal world in its evolution toward higher and higher forms. These shells and
armors begat a kind of torpor and immobility which has continued down to our day with the echinoderms
and mollusks, but the arthropods and vertebrates escaped it by some lucky stroke. Now you and
I are here without imprisoning shells on our backs; but how or why did we escape? Bergson does
not say. Was it a matter of luck or chance? Was there ever a time when the stream of life tended
to harden and become fixed in its own forms like a stream of cooling lava, or has the innate
plasticity of life been easily equal to its own ends? True, the clam remains a clam, and the
starfish remains a starfish; some other forms have carried the evolutionary impulse forward
till it flowered in man. Was this impulse ever really checked or endangered? Was the golden
secret ever intrusted to the keeping of any single form? and, had that form been cut off, would
the earth have been still without its man? These are puzzling questions.

Thus, when we have come to look upon life and nature in the light of evolution, what vistas
are opened to us where before were only blank walls! The geologic ages take on a new interest
to us. We know that in some form we were even there. The systems of sedimentary rocks which
the geologist portrays, piled one upon the other to a depth of fifty miles or more, seem like
the stairway by which we have ascended, taking on some new and more developed form at each
rise. What we were at the first step in Cambrian times only the Lord knows, but whatever we
were, we crept up or floated up to the next rise. In the Silurian seas we may have been a trilobite
for aught we know; at any rate, we were the outcome of the life impulse that begat the trilobites,
but our fate was not bound up with theirs, as their race came to an end in those early geologic
ages, and our stem form did not. Whether or not we were a fish in the Devonian seas, there
is little doubt that we had gills, because we have the gill slits yet in our early foetal life,
and it is quite certain that in some way we owe our backbones to the fishes.

When the rocks that form my native Catskills were being laid down in the Devonian waters, I
fancy that my aquatic embryo was swimming about somewhere and slowly waxing strong. Up and
up I climbed across the sandstone steps, across the limestone, the conglomerate, the slate,
up into Carboniferous times. The upper and nether millstones of the "millstone grit" did not
crush me, neither did the floods and the convulsions of Carboniferous times that buried the
vast vegetable growths that resulted in our coal measures engulf or destroy me. About that
time probably, I emerged from the water and became an amphibian, and maybe got my five fingers
and five toes on each side.

Nor did the wholesale destruction of animal life at the end of Palaeozoic time cut off my line
of descent. The monstrous reptiles of the succeeding or Mesozoic age, the petrified remains
of one of which was recently found in the sandstone rocks near the river's edge under the Palisades
of the Hudson, do not seem to have endangered the golden thread by which our fate hung. Still
"I mount and mount." The stairs by which I climb were rent by earthquakes and volcanoes, the
strata were squeezed up and overturned and folded in the great mountain-chains; the Alps, the
Andes, the Himalayas, the Coast Range were born; the earth-throes must have been tremendous
at times; yet I escaped it all. The huge and fearful mammals of the third or Tertiary period
passed me by unharmed. Eruptions and cataclysms, the sinking of the land, the inundations of
the sea, world-wide deformations of the earth's crust, fire and ice and floods, monsters of
the deep and dragons of the land and the air have beset my course from the first, and yet here
I am, here we all are, and apparently none the worse for the appalling dangers we have passed
through.

Evolution thus makes the world over for us. It shows us in what a complex web of vital and
far-reaching relations we stand. It gives us an outlook upon the past that is startling, and
in some ways forbidding, yet one that ought to be stimulating and inspiring. If we look back
with a shudder we should look forward with a thrill. If the past is terrible, the future is
in the same degree cheering and inviting. If we came out of those lowly and groveling forms,
to what heights of being may we not be carried by the impetus that brought us thus far? In
fact, to what heights has it already carried us!

II

That the hazards of the past, to many forms of life, at least, have been real and no myth,
is evident from the vast number of forms that have been cut off and become extinct; various
causes, now hard to decipher, have worked together to the end, such as changed geographical
conditions, changes of climate, affecting the food-supply, extreme specialization, like that
of the sabre-toothed tiger whose petrified remains have been found in various parts of this
continent, and who apparently was finally handicapped by his huge dental sabre. Probably many
more species of animals have become extinct than have survived, but none of these could have
been in the line of man's descent, else the human race would not have been here. If the Eocene
progenitor of the horse, the little four-toed eohippus, had been cut off, would not the world
have been horseless to-day? The horse in America became extinct, from some cause only conjectural,
many tens of thousands of years ago. Had the same fate befallen the horse in Europe and Asia,
it seems probable that our civilization would have been far less advanced to-day than it is.

The fate of every species of mammal in our time seems to have been in the keeping of a single
form in early Tertiary times. The end of the Cretaceous or chalk period saw the extinction
of the giant reptiles both of sea and of land, at the same time that it saw the appearance
of a great many species of small and inconspicuous mammals, among which doubtless were our
own humble forebears. Extreme specialization in any direction may narrow an animal's chances
of survival; they have but one chance in the game of life, whereas an animal with a more generalized
organization has many chances. Man is one of the most generalized of animals; no special tools,
no special weapons--his hand many tools and weapons in one. This proved to be true, especially
of the Easter Anthem, which was magnificently sung, and an encore was demanded by the delighted
listeners.

Each night the stage was completely filled with this splendid chorus, and the effect was tremendous
when the voices rose with such magnificent volume, unaccompanied. The leader gave the pitch from
an old-fashioned tuning fork, which was the only thing that was used at that time, to start
the music. The leader would cry out in a nasal tone, "All please sound," when the pitch would
be taken by the four parts led by the timist to the successful finish.

Other entertainments of this nature were given. H.M. Bosworth's operetta, "Mother Goose Reception,"
had a tremendous run. It became so popular that it was played in every city and town of any size
from San Bernardino to Sacramento and Stockton and as far north as Oregon. There was a rivalry between
it and the Milkmaid's Convention which received its full merit throughout the state. Mrs. Hodgkins
and Miss Lucy Grove were the bright originators of this cantata, which proved one of the most
interesting debates upon the milk question and microbes ever propounded in any community with
musical setting and was a genuine side-splitting entertainment.

One of the special engagements that occurred yearly were the commencement exercises of the Benicia
Female seminary, a meeting of alumnæ and pupils. From 1862, on my return to California from Boston,
until the death of our instructor, Mary Atkins-Lynch, I was the honored guest as vocalist at
these gatherings, and I count these epochs in my career some of the
special occurrences.

I was among the first pupils of the school and added my talent on all occasions of note during
the continuance of the seminary. It was in Benicia where Mrs. Lynch first began her work as
principal of the seminary. Her pupils are now scattered over every quarter of the globe. A thousand
invitations were sent out and 250 accepted and others sent their regrets from the different cities
in which they resided.

These were put in a list and read with interest by those who gathered in 1878--the last and most
notable reunion of the school. There were at this time Messrs. Gray, Jones, Woodbridge and
Hastings, trustees of the seminary when it was founded. They had not met for years, and the
pleasure they felt at this accidental meeting can be imagined. It was like one large family reunion,
for these men were our friends as well, and through their efforts the seminary was placed upon a
high standard. We were visited yearly by the notable men of the state legislature, army and
navy, professional men and women of culture and talent. It would not be amiss to let the younger
generation be familiar with the names of early Californians who stood
high in the nation and honored men of the state: Capt. and Mrs. Matthew
Turner; Dr. Cole and wife of San Francisco; Professor Trenkle, pianist,
San Francisco; Dr. S. Woodbridge; Judge D.N. Hastings and wife; Hon.
L.B. Mizner and wife; Bishop Wingfield; Major Hackert; Professor Roger
of St. Augustine College; Capt. E.H. von Pfister; General Kautz; Major
Wells; Major Wilhelm; Captain Rixford; Lieutenant Scriven, U.S.A;
Lieutenant Weresch, U.S.N.; C.B. Houghton; Rev. Mr. Easton; Professor
Corbaz; Mrs. Brackett, class '59; Harriett Riddell, Class 72; Major
Townsend; Dr. Peabody; Samuel D. Gray and wife; John Denning; Judge
Lynch; Professor Trenkle, one of the pioneer musicians of the state
and seminary; Mrs. Mary Loughlin Kincaid, of San Francisco high school
fame, president of the alumnæ; Mrs. Mary Hook-Hatch, vice president;
Mrs. Agnes Bell Hill, treasurer; Miss Kittie Stone, secretary; Mrs.
M.R. Blake, the first vocalist of the seminary to distinguish herself
in the world of music and song.

Dr. Woodbridge in his address alluded to old memories connected with this young ladies' seminary, the
trials and vicissitudes of one of its first principals; how she had taken the school in early days
with six or eight pupils and in a few short months had 140 scholars
beneath the roof.

The doctor paid a fitting tribute to the ability and worth of Mrs. Lynch and the grandeur of
her position in the cause of education. Her life was a glorious victory and one that should
be handed down to posterity.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

ROMAN CATHOLIC, EPISCOPAL, AND JEWISH MUSIC. J.H. DOHRMANN. THE BIANCHI'S

During my ten years' engagement at St. Patrick's Church, on Mission street, San Francisco, we
gave many masses and also arranged concerts which would prove of great value to the singers
of today who have aspirations for better music than the frivolous songs and bad style of singing
which is in vogue. The masses that we sang were written by the best masters. Our organist and
director was educated in Europe and received the best musical education and understood the standard
which should be upheld. We were familiar with all of Mozart's masses, requiems and vespers. The Twelfth
was the most frequently sung if grand, joyful music was required.


We may think of our descent in the historic period under the image of the stream, though of
a stream many times delayed and diverted, even many times diminished by wars and plagues and
famine, but a stream with some sort of unity and continuity, since man became man. The stream
of life is like any other stream in this respect. Divert or use up part of the water of a stream,
yet what is left flows on and keeps up the continuity and identity of the stream; dip your
cup into it here, and you will not get precisely the same water you would have got had none
of it been diverted or used far back in its course--you get the water that was allowed to flow by.

Had there been no loss of life by war and pestilence and accidents of various kinds, the different
countries would have been occupied by quite other men and women than those that fill them to-day.
The course of life in every neighborhood is changed by what seem like accidental causes, as
when a family is practically wiped out by some accident or dread disease. This brings new people
on the scene. The farm or the business falls into other hands, and new social relations spring
up, new men and women are brought together or the old ones driven apart, marriage is hastened
or retarded, opportunities for family life are made or unmade, and fewer children, or more
children, as the case may be, are the result. The issue of some battle hundreds or thousands
of years ago may have played a part in your life and mine to-day--other races, other individuals
of the race, would have been thrown together had the issue been different, and other families
started, so that some one else would have been here in our stead.

But the question of hazard to the race of man in geologic time is quite a different one. Here
our fate seems to hang by a single thread--a golden thread, we may call it, but, in that terrible
maze of clashing forces and devouring forms of the vast geologic periods, how liable to be
broken! It is not now a question of the continuity of a stream, but of the continuity of a
single evolutionary process, or, as Haeckel says, the continuity of the morphological chain
which stretches from the lemurs up through tailed and tailless anthropoid apes to man. If the
evolutionary impulse had been checked or extinguished in the lemur--that small apelike animal
that went before the true ape, the fossil remains of which have been found on this continent
and the survivals of which are now found in Madagascar--would man have appeared? Again, if
the race of lemurs developed from a single pair, how precarious seems our fate! In fact, if
any of the transitional forms between species can be reduced to a single pair--as the forms
that connect the reptiles with the mammals--our fate would seem to be in the keeping of these
forms. Over this single frail bridge which escaped the floods and the tornadoes and the earthquakes
of those terrible ages we must have passed. What risky business it all seems! Was it luck or
law that favored us? Doubtless, if we could penetrate the mystery, we should see that there
was no chance or risk in the matter. We cannot go very far in solving these great fundamental
questions by applying to them the tests of our own experience, Numberless specific forms become
extinct, but the impulse that begat the form does not die out. Thus, all the giant reptiles
died out--the dinosaurs, the mesosaurs--but the reptilian impulse still survives. How many
types of invertebrates have perished! but the invertebrate impulse still goes on. How many
species of mammals have been cut off! yet the mammal impulse has steadily gone forward. These
things suggest the wave that moves on but leaves the water behind. The vertebrate impulse began
in wormlike forms, in the old Palaeozoic seas, and stopped not till it culminated in man. This
impulse has left many forms behind it; but has this impulse itself ever been endangered? If
one looks at the matter thus in an abstract instead of a concrete way, the problem of our descent
becomes easier.

When we look at the evolution of life on a grand scale, nature seems to feel her way, like
a blind man, groping, hesitating, trying this road and then that. In some cases the line of
evolution seems to end in a cul de sac beyond which no progress is possible. The forms thus
cornered soon become extinct. The mystery, the unaccountable thing, is the appearance of new
characters. The slow modification or transformation of an existing character may often be traced;
natural selection, or the struggle for existence, takes it in hand and adapts and perpetuates
it, or else eliminates it. But the origin of certain new parts or characters--that is the secret
of the evolutionary process. Thus there was a time when no animal had horns; then horns appeared.
"In the great quadruped known as titanothere," says Osborn, "rudiments of horns first arise
independently at certain definite parts of the skull; they arise at first alike in both sexes,
or asexually; then they become sexual, or chiefly characteristic of males; then they rapidly
evolve in the males while being arrested in development in the females; finally, they become
in some of the animals dominant characteristics to which all others bend." Nature seems to
throw out these new characters and then lets them take their chances in the clash of forces
and tendencies that go on in the arena of life. If they serve a purpose or are an advantage,
they remain; if not, they drop out. Nature feels her way. The horns proved of less advantage
to the females than to the males; they seem a part of the plus or overflow of the male principle,
like the beard in man--the badge of masculinity. The titanothere is traceable back to a hornless
animal the size of a sheep, and it ended in a horned quadruped nearly as large as an elephant.
It flourished in Wyoming in early Tertiary times. Nature did not seem to know what to do with
horns when she first got them. She played with them like a child with a new toy. Thus she gave
two pairs to several species of mammals, one pair on the nose and one pair on the top of the
skull--certainly an embarrassment of weapons.

The first horns appear to have been crude, heavy, uncouth, but long before we reach our own
geologic era they appear in various species of quadrupeds, and become graceful and ornamental.
How beautiful they are in many of the African antelope tribe! Nature's workmanship nearly always
improves with time, like that of man's, and sooner or later takes on an ornamental phase.

The early uncouth, bizarre forms seem to be the result of the excess or surplus of life. Life
in remote biologic times was rank and riotous, as it is now, in a measure, in tropical lands.
One reason may be that the climate of the globe during the middle period, and well into the
third period, appears to have been of a tropical character. The climatic and seasonal divisions
were not at all pronounced, and both animal and vegetable life took on gigantic and grotesque
forms. In the ugliness of alligator and rhinoceros and hippopotamus of our day we get some
hint of what early reptilian and mammalian life was like.

That Nature should have turned out better and better handiwork as the ages passed; that she
either should have improved upon every model or else discarded it; that she should have progressed
from the bird, half-dragon, to the sweet songsters of our day and to the superb forms of the
air that we know; that evolution should have entered upon a refining and spiritualizing phase,
developing larger brains and smaller bodies, is a very significant fact, and one quite beyond
the range of the mechanistic conception of life.

Our own immediate line of descent leads down through the minor forms of Tertiary and Mesozoic
times--forms that probably skulked and dodged about amid the terrible and gigantic creatures
of those ages as the small game of to-day hide and flee from the presence of their arch-enemy,
man; and that the frail line upon which the fate of the human race hung should not have been
severed during the wild turmoil of those ages is, to me, a source of perpetual wonder.

III

The hazards of the future of the race must be quite different from those I have been considering.
They are the hazards incident to an exceptional being upon this earth--a being that takes his
fate in his own hands in a sense that no other creature does.

Man has partaken of the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil, which all the lower orders have
escaped. He knows, and knows that he knows. Will this knowledge, through the opposition in
which it places him to elemental nature and the vast system of artificial things with which
it has enabled him to surround himself, cut short his history upon this planet? Will Nature
in the end be avenged for the secrets he has forced from her? His civilization has doubtless
made him the victim of diseases to which the lower orders, and even savage man, are strangers.
Will not these diseases increase as his life becomes more and more complex and artificial?
Will he go on extending his mastery over Nature and refining or suppressing his natural appetites
till his original hold upon life is fatally enfeebled?

It seems as though science ought to save man and prolong his stay on this planet,--it ought
to bring him natural salvation, as his religion promises him supernatural salvation. But of
course, man's fate is bound up with the fate of the planet and of the biological tree of which
he is one of the shoots. Biology is rooted in geology. The higher forms of life did not arbitrarily
appear, they flowed out of conditions that were long in maturing; they flowered in season,
and the flower will fall in season. Man could not have appeared earlier than he did, nor later
than he did; he came out of what went before, and he will go out with what comes after. His
coming was natural, and his going will be natural. His period had a beginning, and it will
have an end. Natural philosophy leads one to affirm this; but of time measured by human history
he may yet have a lease of tens of thousands of years.

The hazard of the future is a question of both astronomy and geology. That there are cosmic
dangers, though infinitely remote, every astronomer knows. That there are collisions between
heavenly bodies is an indubitable fact, and if collisions do happen to any, allow time enough
and they must happen to all. That there are geologic dangers through the shifting and crumpling
of the earth's crust, every geologist knows, though probably none that could wipe out the whole
race of man. The biologic dangers of the past we have outlived--the dangers that must have
beset a single line of descent amid the carnival of power and the ferocity of the monster reptiles
of Mesozoic times, and the wholesale extinction of species that occurred in different geologic
periods.

Nothing but a cosmic catastrophe, involving the fate of the whole earth, could now exterminate
the human race. It is highly improbable that this will ever happen. The race of man will go
out from a slow, insensible failure, through the aging of the planet, of the conditions of
life that brought man here. The evolutionary process upon a cooling world must, after the elapse
of a vast period of time, lose its impetus and cease.

XIII

THE GOSPEL OF NATURE

I

The other day a clergyman who described himself as a preacher of the gospel of Christ wrote,
asking me to come and talk to his people on the gospel of Nature. The request set me to thinking
whether or not Nature has any gospel in the sense the clergyman had in mind, any message that
is likely to be specially comforting to the average orthodox religious person. I suppose the
parson wished me to tell his flock what I had found in Nature that was a strength or a solace
to myself.

What had all my many years of journeyings to Nature yielded me that would supplement or reinforce
the gospel he was preaching? Had the birds taught me any valuable lessons? Had the four-footed
beasts? Had the insects? Had the flowers, the trees, the soil, the coming and the going of
the seasons? Had I really found sermons in stones, books in running brooks and good in everything?
Had the lilies of the field, that neither toil nor spin, and yet are more royally clad than
Solomon in all his glory, helped me in any way to clothe myself with humility, with justice,
with truthfulness?

It is not easy for one to say just what he owes to all these things. Natural influences work
indirectly as well as directly; they work upon the subconscious, as well as upon the conscious,
self. That I am a saner, healthier, more contented man, with truer standards of life, for all
my loiterings in the fields and woods, I am fully convinced.

That I am less social, less interested in my neighbors and in the body politic, more inclined
to shirk civic and social responsibilities and to stop my ears against the brawling of the
reformers, is perhaps equally true.

One thing is certain, in a hygienic way I owe much to my excursions to Nature. They have helped
to clothe me with health, if not with humility; they have helped sharpen and attune all my
senses; they have kept my eyes in such good trim that they have not failed me for one moment
during all the seventy-five years I have had them; they have made my sense of smell so keen
that I have much pleasure in the wild, open-air perfumes, especially in the spring--the delicate
breath of the blooming elms and maples and willows, the breath of the woods, of the pastures,
of the shore. This keen, healthy sense of smell has made me abhor tobacco and flee from close
rooms, and put the stench of cities behind me. I fancy that this whole world of wild, natural
perfumes is lost to the tobacco-user and to the city- dweller. Senses trained in the open air
are in tune with open-air objects; they are quick, delicate, and discriminating. When I go
to town, my ear suffers as well as my nose: the impact of the city upon my senses is hard and
dissonant; the ear is stunned, the nose is outraged, and the eye is confused. When I come back,
I go to Nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in tune once more. I know
that, as a rule, country or farming folk are not remarkable for the delicacy of their senses,
but this is owing mainly to the benumbing and brutalizing effect of continued hard labor. It
is their minds more than their bodies that suffer.

When I have dwelt in cities the country was always near by, and I used to get a bite of country
soil at least once a week to keep my system normal.

Emerson says that "the day does not seem wholly profane in which we have given heed to some
natural object." If Emerson had stopped to qualify his remark, he would have added, if we give
heed to it in the right spirit, if we give heed to it as a nature-lover and truth-seeker. Nature
love as Emerson knew it, and as Wordsworth knew it, and as any of the choicer spirits of our
time have known it, has distinctly a religious value. It does not come to a man or a woman
who is wholly absorbed in selfish or worldly or material ends. Except ye become in a measure
as little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of Nature--as Audubon entered it, as Thoreau
entered it, as Bryant and Amiel entered it, and as all those enter it who make it a resource
in their lives and an instrument of their culture. The forms and creeds of religion change,
but the sentiment of religion--the wonder and reverence and love we feel in the presence of
the inscrutable universe--persists. Indeed, these seem to be renewing their life to-day in
this growing love for all natural objects and in this increasing tenderness toward all forms
of life. If we do not go to church so much as did our fathers, we go to the woods much more,
and are much more inclined to make a temple of them than they were.

We now use the word Nature very much as our fathers used the word God, and, I suppose, back
of it all we mean the power that is everywhere present and active, and in whose lap the visible
universe is held and nourished. It is a power that we can see and touch and hear, and realize
every moment of our lives how absolutely we are dependent upon it. There are no atheists or
skeptics in regard to this power. All men see how literally we are its children, and all men
learn how swift and sure is the penalty of disobedience to its commands.

Our associations with Nature vulgarize it and rob it of its divinity. When we come to see that
the celestial and the terrestrial are one, that time and eternity are one, that mind and matter
are one, that death and life are one, that there is and can be nothing not inherent in Nature,
then we no longer look for or expect a far-off, unknown God.

Nature teaches more than she preaches. There are no sermons in stones. It is easier to get
a spark out of a stone than a moral. Even when it contains a fossil, it teaches history rather
than morals. It comes down from the fore-world an undigested bit that has resisted the tooth
and maw of time, and can tell you many things if you have the eye to read them. The soil upon
which it lies or in which it is imbedded was rock, too, back in geologic time, but the mill
that ground it up passed the fragment of stone through without entirely reducing it. Very likely
it is made up of the minute remains of innumerable tiny creatures that lived and died in the
ancient seas. Very likely it was torn from its parent rock and brought to the place where it
now lies by the great ice-flood that many tens of thousands of years ago crept slowly but irresistibly
down out of the North over the greater part of all the northern continents.

But all this appeals to the intellect, and contains no lesson for the moral nature. If we are
to find sermons in stones, we are to look for them in the relations of the stones to other
things--when they are out of place, when they press down the grass or the flowers, or impede
the plow, or dull the scythe, or usurp the soil, or shelter vermin, as do old institutions
and old usages that have had their day. A stone that is much knocked about gets its sharp angles
worn off, as do men. "A rolling stone gathers no moss," which is not bad for the stone, as
moss hastens decay. "Killing two birds with one stone" is a bad saying, because it reminds
boys to stone the birds, which is bad for both boys and birds. But "People who live in glass
houses should not throw stones" is on the right side of the account, as it discourages stone-throwing
and reminds us that we are no better than our neighbors.

The lesson in running brooks is that motion is a great purifier and health-producer. When the
brook ceases to run, it soon stagnates. It keeps in touch with the great vital currents when
it is in motion, and unites with other brooks to help make the river. In motion it soon leaves
all mud and sediment behind. Do not proper work and the exercise of will power have the same
effect upon our lives?

The other day in my walk I came upon a sap-bucket that had been left standing by the maple
tree all the spring and summer. What a bucketful of corruption was that, a mixture of sap and
rainwater that had rotted, and smelled to heaven. Mice and birds and insects had been drowned
in it, and added to its unsavory character. It was a bit of Nature cut off from the vitalizing
and purifying chem- istry of the whole. With what satisfaction I emptied it upon the ground
while I held my nose and saw it filter into the turf, where I knew it was dying to go and where
I knew every particle of the reeking, fetid fluid would soon be made sweet and wholesome again
by the chemistry of the soil!

II

I am not always in sympathy with nature-study as pursued in the schools, as if this kingdom
could be carried by assault. Such study is too cold, too special, too mechanical; it is likely
to rub the bloom off Nature. It lacks soul and emotion; it misses the accessories of the open
air and its exhilarations, the sky, the clouds, the landscape, and the currents of life that
pulse everywhere.

I myself have never made a dead set at studying Nature with note-book and field-glass in hand.
I have rather visited with her. We have walked together or sat down together, and our intimacy
grows with the seasons. What I have learned about her ways I have learned easily, almost unconsciously,
while fishing or camping or idling about. My desultory habits have their disadvantages, no
doubt, but they have their advantages also. A too strenuous pursuit defeats itself. In the
fields and woods more than anywhere else all things come to those who wait, because all things
are on the move, and are sure sooner or later to come your way.

To absorb a thing is better than to learn it, and we absorb what we enjoy. We learn things
at school, we absorb them in the fields and woods and on the farm. When we look upon Nature
with fondness and appreciation she meets us halfway and takes a deeper hold upon us than when
studiously conned. Hence I say the way of knowledge of Nature is the way of love and enjoyment,
and is more surely found in the open air than in the school-room or the laboratory. The other
day I saw a lot of college girls dissecting cats and making diagrams of the circulation and
muscle-attachments, and I thought it pretty poor business unless the girls were taking a course
in comparative anatomy with a view to some occupation in life. What is the moral and intellectual
value of this kind of knowledge to those girls? Biology is, no doubt, a great science in the
hands of great men, but it is not for all. I myself have got along very well without it. I
am sure I can learn more of what I want to know from a kitten on my knee than from the carcass
of a cat in the laboratory. Darwin spent eight years dissecting barnacles; but he was Darwin,
and did not stop at barnacles, as these college girls are pretty sure to stop at cats. He dissected
and put together again in his mental laboratory the whole system of animal life, and the upshot
of his work was a tremendous gain to our understanding of the universe.

I would rather see the girls in the fields and woods studying and enjoying living nature, training
their eyes to see correctly and their hearts to respond intelligently. What is knowledge without
enjoyment, without love? It is sympathy, appreciation, emotional experience, which refine and
elevate and breathe into exact knowledge the breath of life. My own interest is in living nature
as it moves and flourishes about me winter and summer.

I know it is one thing to go forth as a nature-lover, and quite another to go forth in a spirit
of cold, calculating, exact science. I call myself a nature-lover and not a scientific naturalist.
All that science has to tell me is welcome, is, indeed, eagerly sought for. I must know as
well as feel. I am not merely contented, like Wordsworth's poet, to enjoy what others understand.
I must understand also; but above all things I must enjoy. How much of my enjoyment springs
from my knowledge I do not know. The joy of knowing is very great; the delight of picking up
the threads of meaning here and there, and following them through the maze of confusing facts,
I know well. When I hear the woodpecker drumming on a dry limb in spring or the grouse drumming
in the woods, and know what it is all for, why, that knowledge, I suppose, is part of my enjoyment.
The other part is the associations that those sounds call up as voicing the arrival of spring:
they are the drums that lead the joyous procession.

To enjoy understandingly, that, I fancy, is the great thing to be desired. When I see the large
ichneumon-fly, Thalessa, making a loop over her back with her long ovipositor and drilling
a hole in the trunk of a tree, I do not fully appreciate the spectacle till I know she is feeling
for the burrow of a tree-borer, Tremex, upon the larvae of which her own young feed. She must
survey her territory like an oil-digger and calculate where she is likely to strike oil, which
in her case is the burrow of her host Tremex. There is a vast series of facts in natural history
like this that are of little interest until we understand them. They are like the outside of
a book which may attract us, but which can mean little to us until we have opened and perused
its pages.

The nature-lover is not looking for mere facts, but for meanings, for something he can translate
into the terms of his own life. He wants facts, but significant facts--luminous facts that
throw light upon the ways of animate and inanimate nature. A bird picking up crumbs from my
window-sill does not mean much to me. It is a pleasing sight and touches a tender cord, but
it does not add much to my knowledge of bird-life. But when I see a bird pecking and fluttering
angrily at my window-pane, as I now and then do in spring, apparently under violent pressure
to get in, I am witnessing a significant comedy in bird-life, one that illustrates the limits
of animal instinct. The bird takes its own reflected image in the glass for a hated rival,
and is bent on demolishing it. Let the assaulting bird get a glimpse of the inside of the empty
room through a broken pane, and it is none the wiser; it returns to the assault as vigorously
as ever.

The fossils in the rocks did not mean much to the earlier geologists. They looked upon them
as freaks of Nature, whims of the creative energy, or vestiges of Noah's flood. You see they
were blinded by the preconceived notions of the six-day theory of creation.

III

I do not know that the bird has taught me any valuable lesson. Indeed, I do not go to Nature
to be taught. I go for enjoyment and companionship. I go to bathe in her as in a sea; I go
to give my eyes and ears and all my senses a free, clean field and to tone up my spirits by
her "primal sanities." If the bird has not preached to me, it has added to the resources of
my life, it has widened the field of my interests, it has afforded me another beautiful object
to love, and has helped make me feel more at home in this world. To take the birds out of my
life would be like lopping off so many branches from the tree: there is so much less surface
of leafage to absorb the sunlight and bring my spirits in contact with the vital currents.
We cannot pursue any natural study with love and enthusiasm without the object of it becoming
a part of our lives. The birds, the flowers, the trees, the rocks, all become linked with our
lives and hold the key to our thoughts and emotions.

Not till the bird becomes a part of your life can its coming and its going mean much to you.
And it becomes a part of your life when you have taken heed of it with interest and affection,
when you have established associations with it, when it voices the spring or the summer to
you, when it calls up the spirit of the woods or the fields or the shore. When year after year
you have heard the veery in the beech and birch woods along the trout streams, or the wood
thrush May after May in the groves where you have walked or sat, and the bobolink summer after
summer in the home meadows, or the vesper sparrow in the upland pastures where you have loitered
as a boy or mused as a man, these birds will really be woven into the texture of your life.

What lessons the birds have taught me I cannot recall; what a joy they have been to me I know
well. In a new place, amid strange scenes, theirs are the voices and the faces of old friends.
In Bermuda the bluebirds and the catbirds and the cardinals seemed to make American territory
of it. Our birds had annexed the island despite the Britishers.

For many years I have in late April seen the red-poll warbler, perhaps for only a single day,
flitting about as I walked or worked. It is usually my first warbler, and my associations with
it are very pleasing. But I really did not know how pleasing until, one March day, when I was
convalescing from a serious illness in one of our sea-coast towns, I chanced to spy the little
traveler in a vacant lot along the street, now upon the ground, now upon a bush, nervous and
hurried as usual, uttering its sharp chip, and showing the white in its tail. The sight gave
me a real home feeling. It did me more good than the medicine I was taking. It instantly made
a living link with many past springs. Anything that calls up a happy past, how it warms the
present! There, too, that same day I saw my first meadowlark of the season in a vacant lot,
flashing out the white quills in her tail, and walking over the turf in the old, erect, alert
manner. The sight was as good as a letter from home, and better: it had a flavor of the wild
and of my boyhood days on the old farm that no letter could ever have.

The spring birds always awaken a thrill wherever I am. The first bobolink I hear flying over
northward and bursting out in song now and then, full of anticipation of those broad meadows
where he will soon be with his mate; or the first swallow twittering joyously overhead, borne
on a warm southern breeze; or the first high-hole sounding out his long, iterated call from
the orchard or field--how all these things send a wave of emotion over me!

Pleasures of another kind are to find a new bird, and to see an old bird in a new place, as
I did recently in the old sugar-bush where I used to help gather and boil sap as a boy. It
was the logcock, or pileated woodpecker, a rare bird anywhere, and one I had never seen before
on the old farm. I heard his loud cackle in a maple tree, saw him flit from branch to branch
for a few moments, and then launch out and fly toward a distant wood. But he left an impression
with me that I should be sorry to have missed.

Nature stimulates our aesthetic and our intellectual life and to a certain extent our religious
emotions, but I fear we cannot find much support for our ethical system in the ways of wild
Nature. I know our artist naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, claims to find what we may call
the biological value of the Ten Commandments in the lives of the wild animals; but I cannot
make his reasoning hold water, at least not much of it. Of course the Ten Commandments are
not arbitrary laws. They are largely founded upon the needs of the social organism; but whether
they have the same foundation in the needs of animal life apart from man, apart from the world
of moral obligation, is another question. The animals are neither moral nor immoral: they are
unmoral; their needs are all physical. It is true that the command against murder is pretty
well kept by the higher animals. They rarely kill their own kind: hawks do not prey upon hawks,
nor foxes prey upon foxes, nor weasels upon weasels; but lower down this does not hold. 1821, and
died November 10, 1876.

"I HAVE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT."

Mr. T.J. Williamson, who executed this bust was entrusted with the order for the new statue.

George
IV.--The first bronze statue ever cast in Birmingham was that of George IV., the work of Sir
Edward Thomason, in 1823. Sir Edward employed the best of talent and spared no pains to turn
out a splendid work of art, but he never found a customer for it. The statue is 6ft. high, weighing
2-1/2 tons, and costing over £1,500, but was sold in November, 1880, to a gentleman in the
neighborhood for £150, little more than the value of the metal.

Goldsmith.--The statue of Goldsmith, in the hall of the Reference Library, is a plaster cast
of the bronze statue manufactured by Messrs. Elkington for the City of Dublin. Hill.--The sum
of £1,500 was raised by public subscription, for the purpose of erecting a statue of Sir Rowland
Hill. The work was executed in marble by Mr. P. Hollins, and pending the erection of the new
Post Office buildings, the charge of the statue was accepted by the Exchange Buildings Committee,
September 12, 1870 and remained in the Birmingham Exchange until the year 1874, when it was
removed to the position in which it at present stands, in the corner of the principal room of
the Post Office, Paradise Street.

Hill, M.D.--A very fine bust of Matthew Davenport Hill, the first Recorder for the borough, is
placed in the Art Gallery at the Reference Library.

James.--A bust of the Rev. Angell James may be seen at Aston Hall.

King Edward VI.--When the old Grammar School was taken down the statue of the King, which had stood
in its niche in the front of the old building for generations, was
broken to pieces on account of so many gentlemen (including governors)
wanting it; as all could not have it, it was destroyed!

Mason.--The
erection of a statue in his honour as proposed in 1870 not meeting
with the approval of Sir Josiah Mason (then Mr.), the Town Council
paid Mr. E.G. Papworth, the chosen sculptor, a solatium or honorarium
of 150 guineas. The worthy knight not being now alive to veto the
project, a figure of him has been placed opposite the College in Edmund
Street.

Murdoch.--There is a bust of William Murdoch, the introducer
of coal-gas as an illuminant, in Handsworth Church. The alarm-cries of the parents are quickly understood by the
young, and their actions imitated in the presence of danger, all of which of course has a biological
value.

The instances which Mr. Seton cites of animals fleeing to man for protection from their enemies
prove to my mind only how the greater fear drives out the lesser. The hotly pursued animal
sees a possible cover in a group of men and horses or in an unoccupied house, and rushes there
to hide. What else could the act mean? So a hunted deer or sheep will leap from a precipice
which, under ordinary circumstances, it would avoid. So would a man. Fear makes bold in such cases.

I certainly have found "good in everything,"--in all natural processes and products,--not the
"good" of the Sunday-school books, but the good of natural law and order, the good of that
system of things out of which we came and which is the source of our health and strength. It
is good that fire should burn, even if it consumes your house; it is good that force should
crush, even if it crushes you; it is good that rain should fall, even if it destroys your crops
or floods your land. Plagues and pestilences attest the constancy of natural law. They set
us to cleaning our streets and houses and to readjusting our relations to outward nature. Only
in a live universe could disease and death prevail. Death is a phase of life, a redistributing
of the type. Decay is another kind of growth.

Yes, good in everything, because law in everything, truth in everything, the sequence of cause
and effect in everything, and it may all be good to me if on the right principles I relate
my life to it. I can make the heat and the cold serve me, the winds and the floods, gravity
and all the chemical and dynamical forces, serve me, if I take hold of them by the right handle.
The bad in things arises from our abuse or misuse of them or from our wrong relations to them.
A thing is good or bad according as it stands related to my constitution. We say the order
of nature is rational; but is it not because our reason is the outcome of that order? Our well-being
consists in learning it and in adjusting our lives to it. When we cross it or seek to contravene
it, we are destroyed. But Nature in her universal procedures is not rational, as I am rational
when I weed my garden, prune my trees, select my seed or my stock, or arm myself with tools
or weapons. In such matters I take a short cut to that which Nature reaches by a slow, roundabout,
and wasteful process. How does she weed her garden? By the survival of the fittest. How does
she select her breeding-stock? By the law of battle; the strongest rules. Hers, I repeat, is
a slow and wasteful process. She fertilizes the soil by plowing in the crop. She cannot take
a short cut. She assorts and arranges her goods by the law of the winds and the tides. She
builds up with one hand and pulls down with the other. Man changes the conditions to suit the
things. Nature changes the things to suit the conditions. She adapts the plant or the animal
to its environment. She does not drain her marshes; she fills them up. Hers is the larger reason--the
reason of the All. Man's reason introduces a new method; it cuts across, modifies, or abridges
the order of Nature. I do not see design in Nature in the old ideological sense; but I see
everything working to its own proper end, and that end is foretold in the means. Things are
not designed; things are begotten. It is as if the final plan of a man's house, after he had
begun to build it, should be determined by the winds and the rains and the shape of the ground
upon which it stands. The eye is begotten by those vibrations in the ether called light, the
ear by those vibrations in the air called sound, the sense of smell by those emanations called
odors. There are probably other vibrations and emanations that we have no senses for because
our well-being does not demand them.

We think it reasonable that a stone should fall and that smoke should rise because we have
never known either of them to do the contrary. We think it reasonable that fire should burn
and that frost should freeze, because this accords with universal experience. Thus, there is
a large order of facts that are reasonable because they are invariable: the same effect always
follows the same cause. Our reason is developed and disciplined by observing the order of Nature;
and yet human rationality is of another order from the rationality of Nature. Man learns from
Nature how to master and control her. He turns her currents into new channels; he spurs her
in directions of his own. Nature has no economic or scientific rationality. She progresses
by the method of trial and error. Her advance is symbolized by that of the child learning to
walk. She experiments endlessly. Evolution has worked all around the horizon. In feeling her
way to man she has produced thousands of other forms of life. The globe is peopled as it is
because the creative energy was blind and did not at once find the single straight road to
man. Had the law of variation worked only in one direction, man might have found himself the
sole occupant of the universe. Behold the varieties of trees, of shrubs, of grasses, of birds,
of insects, because Nature does not work as man does, with an eye single to one particular
end. She scatters, she sows her seed upon the wind, she commits her germs to the waves and
the floods. Nature is indifferent to waste, because what goes out of one pocket goes into another.
She is indifferent to failure, because failure on one line means success on some other.

IV

But I am not preaching much of a gospel, am I? Only the gospel of contentment, of appreciation,
of heeding simple near-by things--a gospel the burden of which still is love, but love that
goes hand in hand with understanding.

There is so much in Nature that is lovely and lovable, and so much that gives us pause. But
here it is, and here we are, and we must make the most of it. If the ways of the Eternal as
revealed in his works are past finding out, we must still unflinchingly face what our reason
reveals to us. "Red in tooth and claw." Nature does not preach; she enforces, she executes.
All her answers are yea, yea, or nay, nay. Of the virtues and beatitudes of which the gospel
of Christ makes so much--meekness, forgiveness, self-denial, charity, love, holiness--she knows
nothing. Put yourself in her way, and she crushes you; she burns you, freezes you, stings you,
bites you, or devours you.

Yet I would not say that the study of Nature did not favor meekness or sobriety or gentleness
or forgiveness or charity, because the great Nature students and prophets, like Darwin, would
rise up and confound me. Certainly it favors seriousness, truthfulness, and simplicity of life;
or, are only the serious and single-minded drawn to the study of Nature? I doubt very much
if it favors devoutness or holiness, as those qualities are inculcated by the church, or any
form of religious enthusiasm. Devoutness and holiness come of an attitude toward the universe
that is in many ways incompatible with that implied by the pursuit of natural science. The
joy of the Nature student like Darwin or any great naturalist is to know, to find out the reason
of things and the meaning of things, to trace the footsteps of the creative energy; while the
religious devotee is intent only upon losing himself in infinite being. True, there have been
devout naturalists and men of science; but their devoutness did not date from their Nature
studies, but from their training, or from the times in which they lived. Theology and science,
it must be said, will not mingle much better than oil and water, and your devout scientist
and devout Nature student lives in two separate compartments of his being at different times.
Intercourse with Nature--I mean intellectual intercourse, not merely the emotional intercourse
of the sailor or explorer or farmer--tends to beget a habit of mind the farthest possible removed
from the myth-making, the vision-seeing, the voice-hearing habit and temper. In all matters
relating to the visible, concrete universe it substitutes broad daylight for twilight; it supplants
fear with curiosity; it overthrows superstition with fact; it blights credulity with the frost
of skepticism. I say frost of skepticism advisedly. Skepticism is a much more healthful and
robust habit of mind than the limp, pale-blooded, non-resisting habit that we call credulity.

In intercourse with Nature you are dealing with things at first hand, and you get a rule, a
standard, that serves you through life. You are dealing with primal sanities, primal honesties,
primal attraction; you are touching at least the hem of the garment with which the infinite
is clothed, and virtue goes out from it to you. It must be added that you are dealing with
primal cruelty, primal blindness, primal wastefulness, also. Nature works with reference to
no measure of time, no bounds of space, and no limits of material. Her economies are not our
economies. She is prodigal, she is careless, she is indifferent; yet nothing is lost. What
she lavishes with one hand, she gathers in with the other. She is blind, yet she hits the mark
because she shoots in all directions. Her germs fill the air; the winds and the tides are her
couriers. When you think you have defeated her, your triumph is hers; it is still by her laws
that you reach your end.

We make ready our garden in a season, and plant our seeds and hoe our crops by some sort of
system. Can any one tell how many hundreds of millions of years Nature has been making ready
her garden and planting her seeds?

There can be little doubt, I think, but that intercourse with Nature and a knowledge of her
ways tends to simplicity of life. Chamberlain, J.--The memorial at the rear of the Town Hall bears
the following inscription:--

"This memorial is created in gratitude for public service given to
this town by Joseph Chamberlain, who was elected town councillor in
November, 1869, Mayor in 1873, and resigned that office in June, 1876,
on being returned as one of the representatives of the borough of
Birmingham in Parliament, and during whose mayoralty many great works
were notably advanced, and mainly by whose ability and devotion the
gas and water undertakings were acquired for the town, to the great
and lasting benefit of the inhabitants."

The memorial was desisigned by Mr. J.H. Chamberlain, of the firm of Martin and Chamberlain, and
was presented to the town October 26, 1880, during the mayoralty of Mr. Richard Chamberlain.
 A man needs a good roof over his head winter and summer, and a good chimney and a
big wood-pile in winter. The more open his four walls are, the more fresh air he will get,
and the longer he will live.

How the contemplation of Nature as a whole does take the conceit out of us! How we dwindle
to mere specks and our little lives to the span of a moment in the presence of the cosmic bodies
and the interstellar spaces! How we hurry! How we husband our time! A year, a month, a day,
an hour may mean so much to us. Behold the infinite leisure of Nature!

A few trillions or quadrillions of years, what matters it to the Eternal? Jupiter and Saturn
must be billions of years older than the earth. They are evidently yet passing through that
condition of cloud and vapor and heat that the earth passed through untold aeons ago, and they
will not reach the stage of life till aeons to come. But what matters it? Only man hurries.
Only the Eternal has infinite time. When life comes to Jupiter, the earth will doubtless long
have been a dead world. It may continue a dead world for aeons longer before it is melted up
in the eternal crucible and recast, and set on its career of life again.

Familiarity with the ways of the Eternal as they are revealed in the physical universe certainly
tends to keep a man sane and sober and safeguards him against the vagaries and half-truths
which our creeds and indoor artificial lives tend to breed. Shut away from Nature, or only
studying her through religious fears and superstitions, what a mess a large body of mankind
in all ages have made of it! Think of the obsession of the speedy "end of the world" which
has so often taken possession of whole communities, as if a world that has been an eternity
in forming could end in a day, or on the striking of the clock! It is not many years since
a college professor published a book figuring out, from some old historical documents and predictions,
just the year in which the great mundane show would break up. When I was a small boy at school
in the early forties, during the Millerite excitement about the approaching end of all mundane
things, I remember, on the day when the momentous event was expected to take place, how the
larger school-girls were thrown into a great state of alarm and agitation by a thundercloud
that let down a curtain of rain, blotting out the mountain on the opposite side of the valley.
"There it comes!" they said, and their tears flowed copiously. I remember that I did not share
their fears, but watched the cloud, curious as to what the end of the world would be like.
I cannot brag, as Thoreau did, when he said he would not go around the corner to see the world
blow up. I am quite sure my curiosity would get the better of me and that I should go, even
at this late day. Or think of the more harmless obsession of many good people about the second
coming of Christ, or about the resurrection of the physical body when the last trumpet shall
sound. A little natural knowledge ought to be fatal to all such notions. Natural knowledge
shows us how transient and insignificant we are, and how vast and everlasting the world is,
which was aeons before we were, and will be other aeons after we are gone, yea, after the whole
race of man is gone. Natural knowledge takes the conceit out of us, and is the sure antidote
to all our petty anthropomorphic views of the universe.

V

I was struck by this passage in one of the recently published letters of Saint-Gaudens: "The
principal thought in my life is that we are on a planet going no one knows where, probably
to something higher (on the Darwinian principle of evolution); that, whatever it is, the passage
is terribly sad and tragic, and to bear up at times against what seems to be the Great Power
that is over us, the practice of love, charity, and courage are the great things."

The "Great Power" that is over us does seem unmindful of us as individuals, if it does not
seem positively against us, as Saint-Gaudens seemed to think it was.

Surely the ways of the Eternal are not as our ways. Our standards of prudence, of economy,
of usefulness, of waste, of delay, of failure--how far off they seem from the scale upon which
the universe is managed or deports itself! Bright has expressed his satisfaction with the model,
which represents him standing erect in an attitude of dignified tranquility, easy and natural with
his left hand in the breast of his coat, while the other hangs down
by his side, emblematic of the Christian charity so characteristic
of our distinguished representative.

Boulton.--There is a fine bust of Matthew Bolton in Handsworth, and as the owner of the great
Soho Works certainly did much to advance the manufactures of this town, foreigners have often expressed
surprise that no statue has been erected to his memory.
Buddha.--The bronze statue of Buddha, now in Aston Hall, is supposed
to be 2,500 years old, and was found buried among the ruins of a temple
at Soottan, on the Ganges, Dec 6, 1862. Some force which no adjective can describe or qualify blew it into fragments,
and there, in its stead, is this swarm of huge rocks making their useless rounds in the light
of the sun forever and ever. What matters it to the prodigal All? Bodies larger than our sun
collide in the depths of space before our eyes with results so terrific that words cannot even
hint them. The last of these collisions--of this "wreck of matter and crush of worlds"--reported
itself to our planet in February, 1901, when a star of the twelfth magnitude suddenly blazed
out as a star of the first magnitude and then slowly faded. It was the grand finale of the
independent existence of two enormous celestial bodies. They apparently ended in dust that
whirled away in the vast abyss of siderial space, blown by the winds upon which suns and systems
drift as autumn leaves. It would be quite in keeping with the observed ways of the Eternal,
if these bodies had had worlds in their train, teeming with life, which met the same fate as
the central colliding bodies.

Does not force as we know it in this world go its own way with the same disregard of the precious
thing we call life? Such long and patient preparations for it,--apparently the whole stellar
system in labor pains to bring it forth,--and yet held so cheaply and indifferently in the
end! The small insect that just now alighted in front of my jack-plane as I was dressing a
timber, and was reduced to a faint yellow stain upon the wood, is typical of the fate of man
before the unregarding and unswerving terrestrial and celestial forces. The great wheels go
round just the same whether they are crushing the man or crushing the corn for his bread. It
is all one to the Eternal. Flood, fire, wind, gravity, are for us or against us indifferently.
And yet the earth is here, garlanded with the seasons and riding in the celestial currents
like a ship in calm summer seas, and man is here with all things under his feet. All is well
in our corner of the universe. The great mill has made meal of our grist and not of the miller.
We have taken our chances and have won. More has been for us than against us. During the little
segment of time that man has been upon the earth, only one great calamity that might be called
cosmical has befallen it. The ice age of one or two hundred thousand years was such a calamity.
But man survived it. The spring came again, and life, the traveler, picked itself up and made
a new start. But if he had not survived it, if nothing had survived it, the great procession
would have gone on just the same; the gods would have been just as well pleased.

The battle is to the strong, the race is to the fleet. This is the order of nature. No matter
for the rest, for the weak, the slow, the unlucky, so that the fight is won, so that the race
of man continues. You and I may fail and fall before our time; the end may be a tragedy or
a comedy. What matters it? Only some one must succeed, will succeed.

We are here, I say, because, in the conflict of forces, the influences that made for life have
been in the ascendant. This conflict of forces has been a part of the process of our development.
We have been ground out as between an upper and a nether millstone, but we have squeezed through,
we have actually arrived, and are all the better for the grinding--all those who have survived.
But, alas for those whose lives went out in the crush! Maybe they often broke the force of
the blow for us.

Nature is not benevolent; Nature is just, gives pound for pound, measure for measure, makes
no exceptions, never tempers her decrees with mercy, or winks at any infringement of her laws.
And in the end is not this best? Could the universe be run as a charity or a benevolent institution,
or as a poor-house of the most approved pattern? Without this merciless justice, this irrefragable
law, where should we have brought up long ago? It is a hard gospel; but rocks are hard too,
yet they form the foundations of the hills.

Man introduces benevolence, mercy, altruism, into the world, and he pays the price in his added
burdens; and he reaps his reward in the vast social and civic organizations that were impossible
without these things. 

Had he indeed lain mouth to mouth with spring in London? Perhaps. But I doubted him. Therefore,
before the lavender appeared, I was beyond the channel.

But last spring I met the girl in the flat below me. Her name was Elsie--Winwood, I think. Of
one thing, however, I am sure; she had cold grey eyes and auburn hair--an uncanny combination;
but she was typical of the English girl, the girl who had been educated
abroad. This girl and I came face to face on the stairs one day. Can we believe that the earth is an alien and a stranger in
the universe? that it has no near kin? that there is no tie of blood, so to speak, between
it and the other planets and systems? Are the planets not all of one family, sitting around
the same central source of warmth and life? And is not our system a member of a still larger
family or tribe, and it of a still larger, all bound together by ties of consanguinity? Size
is nothing, space is nothing. The worlds are only red corpuscles in the arteries of the infinite.
If man has not yet appeared on the other planets, he will in time appear, and when he has disappeared
from this globe, he will still continue elsewhere.

I do not say that he is the end and aim of creation; it would be logical, I think, to expect
a still higher form. Man has been man but a little while comparatively, less than one hour
of the twenty- four of the vast geologic day; a few hours more and he will be gone; less than
another geologic day like the past, and no doubt all life from the earth will be gone. What
then? The game will be played over and over again in other worlds, without approaching any
nearer the final end than we are now. There is no final end, as there was no absolute beginning,
and can be none with the infinite.

THE END
