At the edge of the trees the British officers were also reminding their men about the orders.
'Remember: no firing at all; nothing but the bayonet; and follow the officers in!' QUICK-MARCH!
and the four dense columns came out of the wood, drew clear of it altogether, and advanced
with steady tramp, their muskets at the shoulder and their bayonets gleaming with a deadly
sheen under the fierce, hot, noonday sun. On they came, four magnificent processions, full
of the pride of arms and the firm hope of glorious victory. Three of them were uniform masses
of ordinary redcoats. But the fourth, making straight for Montcalm himself, was half grenadiers,
huge men with high-pointed hats, and half Highlanders, with swinging kilts and dancing plumes.
The march was a short one; but it seemed long, for at every step the suspense became greater
and greater. At last the leading officers suddenly waved their swords, the bugles rang out
the CHARGE! and then, as if the four eager columns had been slipped from one single leash together,
they dashed at the trees with an exultant roar that echoed round the hills like thunder.

Montcalm gripped his sword, and every French finger tightened on the trigger. His colonels
watched him eagerly. Up went his sword and up went theirs. READY!--PRESENT! --FIRE!! and a
terrific, double-shotted, point-blank volley crashed out of that zigzag wall and simply swept
away the heads of the charging columns. But the men in front were no sooner mown down than
the next behind them swarmed forward. Again the French fired, again the leading British fell,
and again more British rushed forward. The British sharp-shooters now spread out in swarms
on the flanks of the columns and fired back, as did the first ranks of the columns themselves.
But they had much the worse of this kind of fighting. Again the columns surged forward, broke
up as they reached the trees, and were shot down as they struggled madly among the sharpened
branches.

Montcalm had given orders that each man was to fire for himself, whenever he could get a good
shot at an enemy; and that the officers were only to look after the powder and shot, see that
none was wasted, and keep their men steady in line. His own work was to watch the whole fight
and send parties of grenadiers from his reserve to any point where the enemy seemed likely
to break in. But the defence weakened only in a single place, where the regiment of Berry,
which had a good many recruits, wavered and began to sway back from its loopholes. Its officers,
however, were among their men in a moment, and had put them into their places again before
the grenadiers whom Montcalm sent running down could reach them.

Again and again the British sharpshooters repeated their fire; again and again the heads of
the columns were renewed by the men behind, as those in front were mown down by the French.
At last, but slowly, sullenly, and turning to have shot after shot at that stubborn defence
of Montcalm's, the redcoats gave way and retreated, leaving hundreds of killed and wounded
behind them. My sure Charles,-- I am dear you'll be worrying about me again, wondering why i'm doggo, what mischief
i'm up to, or whether anything has happened to me. Something has happened, but i'm not quite afraid
myself what it is. Anyhow, i'll tell you all I know. But men were ready with water; and even when the
flames caught on the side towards the enemy there was no lack of volunteers to jump down and
put them out. The fort, half a mile in rear and overlooking the whole scene, did good work
with its guns. Once it stopped an attack on the extreme left by a flotilla of barges which
came out of the mouth of the river running through the four-mile valley between the lakes.
Two barges were sent to the bottom. Several others were well peppered by the French reserves,
who ran down to the bank of the river; and the rest turned round and rowed back as hard as
they could.

In all this heat of action Vaudreuil was not forgotten; but he would not have felt flattered
by what the soldiers said. All knew how slow he had been about sending the Canadians, 3,000
of whom were already long overdue. 'Bah!' they said during the first lull in the battle; 'the
governor has sold the colony; but we won't let him deliver the goods! God save the King and
Montcalm!'

This first lull was not for long. On came the four red columns again, just as stubborn as before.
Again they charged. Again they split up in front as they reached the fatal trees. Again they
were shot down. Again rank after rank replaced the one that fell before it. Again the sharpshooters
stood up to that death-dealing loopholed wall. And again the British retired slowly and sullenly,
leaving behind them four larger heaps of killed and wounded.

A strange mistake occurred on both sides. Whenever the French soldiers shouted 'God save the
King and Montcalm,' the ensigns carrying the colours of the regiment of Guienne waved them
high in the air. The flags were almost white, and some of the British mistook them for a sign
of surrender. Calling out 'Quarter, Quarter!' the redcoats held their muskets above their heads
and ran in towards the wall. The French then thought it was the British who wished to surrender,
and called out 'Ground Arms!' But Pouchot, the officer who had marched night and day from the
Mohawk valley to join Montcalm, seeing what he thought a serious danger that the British would
break through, called out 'Fire!' and his men, most of them leaning over the top of the wall,
poured in a volley that cut down more than a hundred of the British.

The Canadians in the separate trench on the low ground, at the extreme right, were not closely
engaged at all. They and the American rangers took pot-shots at each other without doing much
harm on either side. In the middle of the battle the Canadians were joined by 250 of their
friends, just come in from Lake Champlain. But even with this reinforcement they made only
a very feeble attack on the exposed left flank of the British column nearest to them on the
higher ground, in spite of the fact that this column was engaged in a keen fight with the French
in its front, and was getting much the worse of it. When Levis sent two French officers down
to lead an attack on the British column the Canadian officers joined it at once. But the mass
of the men hung back. They were raiders and bush-fighters. They had no bayonets. Above all,
they did not intend to come to close quarters if they could help it. Ticonderoga was no attack
by men from the British colonies and no French-Canadian defence and victory. It was a stand-up
fight between the French and the British regulars, who settled it between themselves alone.

About five o'clock the two left columns of the British joined forces to make a supreme effort.
They were led by the Highlanders, who charged with the utmost fury, while the two right columns
made an equally brave attack elsewhere. The front ranks were shot down as before. But the men
in rear rushed forward so fast--every fallen man seeming to make ten more spring over his body--that
Montcalm was alarmed, and himself pressed down at the head of his grenadiers to the point where
the fight was hottest. At the same time Levis, finding his own front clear of the old fourth
column, brought over the regiment of La Reine and posted it in rear of the men who most needed
its support. These two reinforcements turned the scale of victory, and the charge failed.

Abercromby, unlike Montcalm, never exposed himself on the field at all. But, for the second
time, he sent word that the trenches must be taken with the bayonet. The response was another
attack. But the men were tired out by the sweltering heat and a whole afternoon of desperate
fighting. They advanced, fired, had their front ranks shot down again; and once more retired
in sullen silence. The last British attack had failed. Their sharp-shooters and the American
rangers covered the retreat. Montcalm had won the day, the most glorious that French arms had
seen in the whole of their long American career.

The British had lost 2,000 men, nearly all regulars. But they still had 4,000 regulars left,
more than Montcalm's entire command could muster now. He went into action with 3,500 French
regulars, 150 Canadian regulars, 250 Canadian militia, and 15 Indians: a total of 3,915. At
four o'clock 250 more Canadians arrived. But as his loss was 400 killed and wounded, nearly
all French regulars, he had not 4,000 fit for action, of all kinds together, at any one time;
and he ended the day with only 3,765. On the other hand, Abercromby still had nearly all his
9,000 militia, besides 500 Indians; who, though worthless in the battle, were dangerous in
the bush. Under these conditions it would have been sheer madness for Montcalm to have followed
the British into their own country, especially as he lacked food almost more than he lacked men.

The losses of the different kinds of troops on both sides show us by whom most of the fighting
was done. The Indians had no losses, either from among the 15 French or the 500 British. The
Canadians and the American militia each lost about one man in every twenty-seven. The French
regulars, fighting behind entrenchments and under a really great general; lost in proportion
about three times as many as these others did, or one man in every nine. The British regulars,
fighting in the open against entrenchments and under a blundering commander, lost nearly one
man in every three.

Abercromby, having been pig-headed in his advance, now became chicken-hearted in his retreat.
He was in no danger. Yet he ran like a hare. Had it not been for his steady regulars and some
old hands among the rangers his return would have become a perfect rout. Pitt soon got rid
of him; and he retired into private life with the well-earned nickname of 'Mrs. Nabby-Cromby.'

Montcalm was a devout man.
   Behold the conquering Cross!
        'Tis God the triumph wrought!'

But the glorious joy of victory did not last long. Vaudreuil claimed most of the credit for
himself and the Canadians. He wrote lying dispatches to France and senseless orders to Montcalm.
Now that reinforcements were worse than useless, because they ate up the food and could not
attack the enemy, he kept on sending them every day. If we were more or less certain that by perseverance
i should succeed in our object, then let us persevere and defy all
privations and risk. Many of us have hoped for and built on intervention, but
personally I see no ground for such hope. Vaudreuil had also sent Indians, of course after the need for them had passed. They
were idle and a perfect nuisance to the French. They began stealing the hospital stores and
all the strong drink they could lay hands on. Montcalm checked them sharply. Then they complained
to Vaudreuil, and Vaudreuil reproached Montcalm.

It was the same wretched story over and over again: the owls and foxes in the rear thwarting,
spiting and robbing the lions at the front. Montcalm was more sick at heart than ever. He saw
that anything he could say or do was of little use; and he again asked to be recalled. But
he soon heard news which made him change his mind, no matter what the cost to his feelings.
The east and the west had both fallen into British hands. Louisbourg and the Ohio were taken.
Only Canada itself remained; and, even now, Pitt was planning to send against it overpowering
forces both by sea and land. Montcalm would not, could not, leave the ruined colony he had
fought for so long against such fearful odds. In the desperate hope of saving it from impending
doom, he decided to stay to the end.

CHAPTER VI

QUEBEC 1759

Having decided to stay in Canada Montcalm did all he could to come to terms with Vaudreuil,
so that the French might meet with a united front the terrible dangers of the next campaign.
He spoke straight out in a letter written to Vaudreuil on August 2, less than a month after
his victory at Ticonderoga: 'I think the real trouble lies with the people who compose your
letters, and with the mischief-makers who are trying to set you against me. You may be sure
that none of the things which are being done against me will ever lessen my zeal for the good
of the country or my respect towards you, the governor. Why not change your secretary's style?
Why not give me more of your confidence? I take the liberty of saying that the king's service
would gain by it, and we should no longer appear so disunited that even the British know all
about it. I enclose a newspaper printed in New York which mentions it. False reports are made
to you. Efforts are made to embitter you against me. I think you need not suspect my military
conduct, when I am really doing all I can. After my three years of command under your orders
what need is there for your secretary to tell me about the smallest trifles and give me petty
orders that I should myself blush to give to a junior captain?'

When Montcalm wrote this he had not yet heard the bad news from Louisbourg and the Ohio, and
he was still anxious to be recalled to France. Vaudreuil, of course, was delighted at the prospect
of getting rid of him: 'I beseech you,' he wrote home to France, 'to ask the king to recall
the Marquis of Montcalm. He desires it himself. The king has confided Canada to my own care,
and I cannot help thinking that it would be a very bad thing for the marquis to remain here
any longer!' There spoke the owl. And here the lion, when the bad news came: 'I had asked for
my recall after Ticonderoga. But since the affairs of Canada are getting worse, it is my duty
to help in setting them right again, or at least to stave off ruin so long as I can.'

Vaudreuil and Montcalm met and talked matters over. Even the governor began to see that the
end was near, unless France should send out help in the spring of 1759. And then it came into my
mind, I know not submit, to call upon Elias, and at the same moment I saw the sun rise in the
heavens; and while I cried out Elias with all my might, behold! the splendor of the sun was shed
upon me, and immediately shook from me all weightiness.all heaviness. They sailed in November with letters from
both Montcalm and Vaudreuil. Nothing could have been better or truer than the letters Vaudreuil
gave them to present at court. 'Colonel Bougainville is, in all respects, better fitted than
anybody else to inform you of the state of the colony. I have given him my orders, and you
can trust entirely in everything he tells you.' 'M. Doreil, the commissary of war, may be entirely
trusted. Everybody likes him here.' But, by the same ship, the same Vaudreuil wrote a secret
letter against these officers and against Montcalm. 'In order to condescend to the Marquis
of Montcalm and do all I can to keep on good terms with him I have given letters to Colonel
Bougainville and M. Doreil. But I must tell you that they do not really know Canada well, and
I warn you that they are nothing but creatures of the Marquis of Montcalm.'

The winter of 1758-59 was like the two before it, only very much worse. The three might be
described, in so many words, as bad, worse, and worst of all. Doreil had seen the stores and
provisions of the army plundered by the Bigot gang, the soldiers half starved, the supposed
presents for the Indians sold to them at the highest possible price, and the forts badly built
of bad materials by bad engineers, who made a Bigot-gang profit out of their work. A report
was also going home from a French inspector who had been sent out to see why the cost of government
had been rising by leaps and bounds. Things were cheap in those days, and money was scarce
and went a long way. When this was the case the whole public expense of Canada for a year should
not have been more than one million dollars. But in Montcalm's first year it had already passed
two millions. In his second it had passed four. And now, in his third, it was getting very
near to eight.

Where did the money go? Just where all public money always goes when parasites govern a country.
The inspector found out that many items of cost for supplies to the different posts had a cipher
added to them. The officials told him why: 'We have to do it because the price of living has
gone up ten times over.' But how did such an increase come about? The goods were sold from
favourite to favourite, each man getting his wholly illegal profit, till the limit was reached
beyond which Bigot thought it would not be safe to go. By means of false accounts, by lying
reports and by the aid of accomplices in France who stopped letters from Montcalm and other
honest men, the game went on for two years. Now it was found out. But the gang was still too
strong in Canada to be broken up. In France it was growing weak. Another couple of years and
all its members would have been turned out by the home government. They knew this; and, seeing
that their end was coming in one way or another, they thought a British conquest could not
be much worse than a French prison; indeed, it might be better, for a complete and general
ruin might destroy proof of their own guilt. The lions would die fighting--and a good thing
too! But the owls and foxes might escape with the spoils. 'What a country, where knaves grow
rich and honest men are ruined!'

Montcalm wrote home to his family by every ship. He might not have long to do so. Just after
Ticonderoga he wrote to his wife: 'Thank God! it is all over now until the beginning of May.
We shall have desperate work in the next campaign. The enemy will have 50,000 men in the field,
all together; and we, how many? I dare not tell it. Adieu, my heart, I long for peace and you.
When shall I see my Candiac again?' On November 21, 1758, the last ship left for France. He
wrote to his old mother, to whom he had always told the story of his wars, from the time when,
thirty-one years before, as a stripling of fifteen, he had joined his father's regiment in
the very year that Wolfe was born: 'You will be glad to hear from me up to the last moment
and know, for the hundredth time, that I am always thinking of you all at home, in spite of
the fate of New France and my duty with the army and the state. We did our best these last
three years; and so, God helping us, we shall in 1759--unless you can make a peace for us in
Europe.'

The wretched winter dragged on. The French were on half rations, the Canadians worse off still.
In January Montcalm wrote in his diary: 'terrible distress round Quebec.' Then, the same day:
'balls, amusements, picnics, and tremendous gambling.' Another entry: 'in spite of the distress
and impending ruin of the colony pleasure parties are going on the whole time.' He himself
had only plain fare--horse-flesh and the soldier's half ration of bread--on his table. No wonder
the vampires hated him!
