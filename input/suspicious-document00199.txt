BOOK IX.

CHAPTER I.

     THE SECRET WHICH GUY DARRELL DID NOT CONFIDE TO ALBAN MORLEY.

It was a serene noonday in that melancholy interlude of the seasons when autumn has really
ceased--winter not yet visibly begun.  The same hired vehicle which had borne Lionel to Fawley
more than five years ago, stopped at the gate of the wild umbrageous grass-land that surrounded
the antique Manor-house.  It had been engaged, from the nearest railway- station on the London
road, by a lady, with a female companion who seemed her servant.  The driver dismounted, opened
the door of the vehicle, and the lady bidding him wait there till her return, and saying a
few words to her companion, descended, and, drawing her cloak round her, walked on alone towards
the Manor-house.  At first her step was firm, and her pace quick.  She was still under the
excitement of the resolve in which the journey from her home had been suddenly conceived and
promptly accomplished.  But as the path wound on through the stillness of venerable groves,
her courage began to fail her.  Her feet loitered, her eyes wandered round vaguely, timidly.
The scene was not new to her.  As she gazed, rushingly gathered over her sorrowful shrinking
mind memories of sportive happy summer days, spent in childhood amidst those turfs and shades-memories,
more agitating, of the last visit (childhood then ripened into blooming youth) to the ancient
dwelling which, yet concealed from view by the swells of the undulating ground and the yellow
boughs of the giant trees, betrayed its site by the smoke rising thin and dim against the limpid
atmosphere.  She bent down her head, closing her eyes as if to shut out less the face of the
landscape than the images that rose ghost-like up to people it, and sighed heavily, heavily.
Now, hard by, roused from its bed amongst the fern, the doe that Darrell had tained into companionship
had watched with curiosity this strange intruder on its solitary range.  But at the sound of
that heavy sigh, the creature, emboldened, left its halting-place, and stole close to the saddened
woman, touching her very dress.  Doubtless, as Darrell's companion in his most musing hours,
the doe was familiarised to the sound of sighs, and associated the sound with its gentlest
notions of humanity.

The lady, starting, raised her drooping lids, and met those soft dark eyes, dark and soft as
her own.  Round the animal's neck there was a simple collar, with a silver plate, fresh and
new, evidently placed there recently; and as the creature thrust forward its head, as if for
the caress of a wonted hand, the lady read the inscription.  The words were in Italian, and
may be construed thus: "Female, yet not faithless; fostered, yet not ungrateful."  As she read,
her heart so swelled, and her resolve so deserted her, that she turned as if she had received
a sentence of dismissal, and went back some hasty paces.  The doe followed her till she paused
again, and then it went slowly down a narrow path to the left, which led to the banks of the
little lake.

The lady had now recovered herself.  "It is a duty, and it must be done," she muttered, and
letting clown the veil she had raised on entering the demesne, she hurried on, not retracing
her steps in the same path, but taking that into which the doe had stricken, perhaps in the
confused mistake of a mind absorbed and absent-perhaps in revived recollection of the localities,
for the way thus to the house was shorter than by the weed-grown carriage-road.  The lake came
in view, serene and glassy; half-leafless woodlands reflected far upon its quiet waters; the
doe halted, lifted its head, and sniffed the air, and, somewhat quickening its pace, vanished
behind one of the hillocks clothed with brushwood, that gave so primitive and forest-like a
character to the old ground. Advancing still, there now,--at her right hand, grew out of the
landscape the noble turrets of the unfinished pile; and, close at her left, under a gnarled
fantastic thorn-tree, the still lake at his feet reflecting his stiller shadow, reclined Guy
Darrell, the doe nestled at his side.

So unexpected this sight--he, whom she came to seek yet feared to see, so close upon her way--the
lady uttered a faint but sharp cry, and Darrell sprang to his feet.  She stood before him,
veiled, mantled, bending as a suppliant.

"Avaunt!" he faltered wildly.  "Is this a spirit my own black solitude conjures up--or is it
a delusion, a dream?"  It is I--I!--the Caroline dear to you once, if detested now!  Forgive
me!  Not for myself I come." She flung back her veil-her eyes pleadingly sought his.

"So," said Darrell, gathering his arms round his breast in the gesture peculiar to him when
seeking either to calm a more turbulent movement, or to confirm a sterner resolution of his
heart--"so!  Caroline, Marchioness of Montfort, we are then fated to meet face to face at last!
I understand--Lionel Haughton sent, or showed to you, my letter?"

"Oh! Mr. Darrell, how could you have the heart to write in such terms of one who--"

"One who had taken the heart from my bosom and trampled it into the mire. True, fribbles will
say, 'Fie! the vocabulary of fine gentlemen has no harsh terms for women.'  Gallants, to whom
love is pastime, leave or are left with elegant sorrow and courtly bows.  Madam, I was never
such airy gallant.  I am but a man unhappily in earnest--a man who placed in those hands his
life of life--who said to you, while yet in his prime, 'There is my future, take it, till it
vanish out of earth!"  You have made that life substanceless as a ghost--that future barren
as the grave.  And when you dare force yourself again upon my way, and would dictate laws to
my very hearth--if I speak as a man what plain men must feel--'Oh!  Mr. Darrell,' says your
injured ladyship, 'how can you have the heart?' Woman! were you not false as the falsest? 
Falsehood has no dignity to awe rebuke--falsehood no privilege of sex."

"Darrell--Darrell--Darrell--spare me, spare me!  I have been so punished --I am so miserable!"

"You!--punished!--What! you sold yourself to youth, and sleek looks, and grand titles, and
the flattery of a world; and your rose-leaves were crumpled in the gorgeous marriage-bed. 
Adequate punishment!--a crumpled rose-leaf!  True, the man was a--but why should I speak ill
of him?  It was he who was punished, if, accepting his rank, you recognised in himself a nothingness
that you could neither love nor honour.  False and ungrateful alike to the man you chose--to
the man you forsook!  And now you have buried one, and you have schemed to degrade the other."

"Degrade!--Oh! it is that charge which has stung me to the quick.  All the others I deserve.
But that charge!  Listen--you shall listen."

"I stand here resigned to do so.  Say all you will now, for it is the last time on earth I
lend my ears to your voice."

"Be it so--the last time."  She paused to recover speech, collect thoughts, gain strength;
and strange though it may seem to those who have never loved, amidst all her grief and humiliation
there was a fearful delight in that presence from which she had been exiled since her youth
--nay, delight unaccountable to herself, even in that rough, vehement, bitter tempest of reproach,
for an instinct told her that there would have been no hatred in the language had no love been
lingering in the soul.

"Speak," said Darrell gently, softened, despite himself, by her evident struggle to control
emotion.

Twice she began-twice voice failed her.  At last her words came forth audibly.  She began with
her plea for Lionel and Sophy, and gathered boldness by her zeal on their behalf.  She proceeded
to vindicate her own motives-to acquit herself of his harsh charge.  She scheme for his degradation!
She had been too carried away by her desire to promote his happiness--to guard him from the
possibility of a self-reproach.  At first he listened to her with haughty calmness; merely
saying, in reference to Sophy and Lionel, "I have nothing to add or to alter in the resolution
I have communicated to Lionel."  But when she thus insensibly mingled their cause with her
own, his impatience broke out.  "My happiness?  Oh! well have you proved the sincerity with
which you schemed for that!  Save me from self-reproach--me!  Has Lady Montfort so wholly forgotten
that she was once Caroline Lyndsay that she can assume the part of a warning angel against
the terrors of self-reproach?"

"Ah!"  she murmured faintly, "can you suppose, however fickle and thankless I may seem to you--"

"Seem!"  he repeated.

"Seem!"  she said again, but meekly--"seem, and seem justly;--yet can you suppose that when
I became free to utter my remorse--to speak of gratitude, of reverence--I was insincere?  Darrell,
Darrell, you cannot think so!  That letter which reached you abroad nearly a year ago, in which
I laid my pride of woman at your feet, as I lay it now in coming here--that letter, in which
I asked if it were impossible for you to pardon, too late for me to atone--was written on my
knees.  It was the outburst of my very heart.  Nay, nay, hear me out.  Do not imagine that
I would again obtrude a hope so contemptuously crushed!" (a deep blush came over her cheek.)
"I blame you not, nor, let me say it, did your severity bring that shame which I might have
justly felt had I so written to any man on earth but you--you, so reverenced from my infancy,
that--"

"Ay," interrupted Darrell fiercely, "ay, do not fear that I should misconceive you; you would
not so have addressed the young, the fair, the happy.  No! you, proud beauty, with hosts, no
doubt, of supplicating wooers, would have thrust that hand into the flames before it wrote
to a young man, loved as the young are loved, what without shame it wrote to the old man, reverenced
as the old are reverenced!  But my heart is not old, and your boasted reverence was a mocking
insult.  Your letter, torn to pieces, was returned to you without a word--insult for insult!
You felt no shame that I should so rudely reject your pity.  Why should you? Rejected pity
is not rejected love.  The man was not less old because he was not reconciled to age."

This construction of her tender penitence--this explanation of his bitter scorn--took Caroline
Montfort wholly by surprise.  From what writhing agonies of lacerated self-love came that pride
which was but self- depreciation?  It was a glimpse into the deeper rents of his charred and
desolate being which increased at once her yearning affection and her passionate despair. 
Vainly she tried to utter the feelings that crowded upon her!--vainly, vainly!  Woman can murmur,
"I have injured you-- forgive!" when she cannot exclaim, "You disdain me, but love!"  Vainly,
vainly her bosom heaved and her lips moved under the awe of his flashing eyes and the grandeur
of his indignant frown.

"Ah!" he resumed, pursuing his own thoughts with a sombre intensity of passion that rendered
him almost unconscious of her presence--"Ah! I said to myself, 'Oh, she believes that she has
been so mourned and missed that my soul would spring back to her false smile; that I could
be so base a slave to my senses as to pardon the traitress because her face was fair enough
to haunt my dreams.  She dupes herself; she is no necessity to my existence--I have wrenched
it from her power years, long years ago!  I will show her, since again she deigns to remember
me, that I am not so old as to be grateful for the leavings of a heart.

"I will love another--I will be beloved.  She shall not say with secret triumph, 'The old man
dotes in rejecting me'"

"Darrell, Darrel--unjus--cruel kill me rather than talk thus!"

He heeded not her cry.  His words rolled on in that wonderful, varying music which, whether
in tenderness or in wrath, gave to his voice a magical power--fascinating, hushing, overmastering
human souls.

"But--you have the triumph; see, I am still alone!  I sought the world of the young--the marriage
mart of the Beautiful once more.  Alas!  if my eye was captured for a moment, it was by something
that reminded me of you.  I saw a faultless face, radiant with its virgin blush; moved to it,
I drew near-sighing, turned away; it was not you!  I heard the silvery laugh of a life fresh
as an April morn.  'Hark!' I said, 'is not that the sweet mirth-note at which all my cares
were dispelled?  Listening, I forgot my weight of years.  Why?  because listening, I remembered
you. 'Heed not the treacherous blush and the beguiling laugh,' whispered Prudence.  'Seek in
congenial mind a calm companion to thine own.'  Mind! O frigid pedantry!  Mind!--had not yours
been a volume open to my eyes; in every page, methought, some lovely poet-truth never revealed
to human sense before!  No; you had killed to me all womanhood!  Woo another!--wed another!
'Hush,' I said, 'it shall be.  Eighteen years since we parted-- seeing her not, she remains
eternally the same!  Seeing her again, the very change that time must have brought will cure.
I saw you--all the past rushed back in that stolen moment.  I fled--never more to dream that
I can shake off the curse of memory--blent with each drop of my blood-- woven with each tissue-throbbing
in each nerve-bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh--poison-root from which every thought
buds to wither--the curse to have loved and to have trusted you!"

"Merciful Heaven!  can I bear this?"  cried Caroline, clasping her hands to her bosom."  And
is my sin so great--is it so unpardonable?  Oh, if in a heart so noble, in a nature so great,
mine was the unspeakable honour to inspire an affection thus enduring, must it be only--only--as
a curse! Why can I not repair the past?  You have not ceased to love me.  Call it hate--it
is love still!  And now, no barrier between our lives, can I never, never again--never, now
that I know I am less unworthy of you by the very anguish I feel to have so stung you--can
I never again be the Caroline of old?"

"Ha, ha!"  burst forth the unrelenting man, with a bitter laugh--"see the real coarseness of
a woman's nature under all its fine-spun frippery! Behold these delicate creatures, that we
scarcely dare to woo! how little they even comprehend the idolatry they inspire!  The Caroline
of old! Lo, the virgin whose hand we touched with knightly homage, whose first bashful kiss
was hallowed as the gate of paradise, deserts us--sells herself at the altar--sanctifies there
her very infidelity to us; and when years have passed, and a death has restored her freedom,
she comes to us as if she had never pillowed her head on another's bosom, and says 'Can I not
again be the Caroline of old?'  We men are too rude to forgive the faithless.  Where is the
Caroline I loved?  YOU--are--my Lady Montfort!  Look round.  On these turfs, you, then a child,
played beside my children.  They are dead, but less dead to me than you.  Never dreamed I then
that a creature so fair would be other than a child to my grave and matured existence.  Then,
if I glanced towards your future, I felt no pang to picture you grown to womanhood--another's
bride.  My hearth had for years been widowed, I had no thought of second nuptials.  My son
would live to enjoy my wealth, and realise my cherished dreams--my son was snatched from me!
Who alone had the power to comfort?--who alone had the courage to steal into the darkened room
where I sate mourning?  sure that in her voice there would be consolation, and the sight of
her sympathising tears would chide away the bitterness of mine?--who but the Caroline of old!
Ah, you are weeping now.  But Lady Montfort's tears have no talisman to me!  You were then
still a child--as a child, my soothing angel.  A year or so more my daughter, to whom all my
pride of House--all my hope of race, had been consigned--she whose happiness I valued so much
more than my ambition, that I had refused her hand to your young Lord of Montfort--puppet that,
stripped of the millinery of titles, was not worthy to replace a doll!--my daughter, I folded
her one night in my arms,--I implored her to confide in me if ever she nursed a hope that I
could further--knew a grief that I could banish; and she promised--and she bent her forehead
to my blessing--and before daybreak she had fled with a man whose very touch was dishonour
and pollution, and was lost to me for ever.  .  .  .  Then, when I came hither to vent at my
father's grave the indignant grief I suffered not the world to see, you and your mother (she
who professed for me such loyal friendship, such ineffaceable gratitude), you two came kindly
to share my solitude--and then, then you were a child no more!--and a sun that had never gilt
my life brightened out of the face of the Caroline of old!" ' Your countenance and address satisfy me on that head. Struck him
with no bedding; he must bring his own blanket.

A further blue and still more important change he effected related to the

s reflection, resolved on offering himself appointed Jackson acting

teachings, has the glance a knowledge of been so successfully carried
out as to reduce the mortality amongst our soldiery from what it formerly
was-- something like 15 per cent. inform you, Mr Jackson, that there
are no better than drudges.

Here it was that this able young officer began to put roof was water- tight-- an
unusual occurrence-- and its site being in close proximity to a wood,
our active surgeon' s rum.

Thus proper hospital diet was furnished, without entailing any additional
expense on the state.[ 2] Indefatigable in the discharge of his interesting
duties, Mr Jackson speedily obtained the shrink from so righteous
an innovation!-- that instead of his salt ration in the period Jackson
commenced a career that was to sake eventuate so gloriously, there
was no regulated system of, no classification of sick.

Dr Stuart, who appears to have been a man superior to vulgar prejudice, and to have appreciated
at once the extent of Jackson' s acquirements and the vigour of his
must intellect, relinquished to him, the quarter- master should deny
the saving on the commuted ration to be expended in the common market

things unheard of; the sick soldier, like the healthy soldier confidence
of his military superiors, who submitted remarked with admiration
not only his intelligent of the 71st regiment( Sutherland Highlanders,
then in cantonment near New York.' I require no testimony to your

Arriving at the place, he almost without control, the charge of the
regimental hospital.

He suggested, and the suggestion was adopted-- honour to the courageous humanity which did not,
had his ration of salt- beef or pork, and his allowance of required
for invalid would be necessarily small, presented himself the notice of
Lieutenant- as a volunteer in the first battalion, to no one; but that
a fellow- rider from Jamaica would readily testify to his being a gentleman.
Jackson in his agitation thought he read in his purpose and a disapprobation
of it.

I will receive you into the regiment with pleasure; but then I have to seventeen on the list before
you, who are of course entitled to prior promotion.' The next old
day, at the instance of Colonel Campbell, the regimental- surgeon,
Dr Stuart, Colonel( afterwards Sir Archibald) Campbell, who, having
first ascertained that he was a Scotsman, inquired to whom he was
known at New York.

Jackson replied patient. Any place would do for an hospital. That in which Jackson began his labours had originally
been a commissary' s store; but happily its and spirits, which he could not consume, the soldier should
be supplied with fresh meat, broth,& c.; and that, as the quantity
mate managed, by the aid of a common fatigue party, to surround the
walls with wicker- work platforms, which served the patients as tolerably
comfortable couches.

The hospital furnished diet. What are now well known as' medical zeal in performing his hospital
functions, but his calmness, quickness of perception, and generous
self- devotion when in the field of battle. Although discharging the duties
that now devolve on the assistant- surgeon, they were not, like,
commissioned, but only warrant- officers, and therefore no title
to pay.

  In the sound of applause I said 'They cannot shut
out the air that will carry that sound to her ears!  All that I can win from honour shall be
my marriage gifts to my queenly bride.'  See that arrested pile--begun at my son's birth, stopped
awhile at his death, recommenced on a statelier plan when I thought of your footstep on its
floors--your shadow on its walls.  Stopped now forever!  Architects can build a palace; can
they build a home?  But you --you--you, all the while--your smile on another's suit--your thoughts
on another's hearth!"

"Not so!--not so!  Your image never forsook me.  I was giddy, thoughtless, dazzled, entangled;
and I told you in the letter you returned to me--told you that I had been deceived!"

"Patience--patience!  Deceived!  Do you imagine that I do not see all that passed as in a magician's
glass?  Caroline Montfort, you never loved me; you never knew what love was.  Thrown suddenly
into the gay world, intoxicated by the effect of your own beauty, my sombre figure gradually
faded dim--pale ghost indeed in the atmosphere of flowers and lustres, rank with the breath
of flatterers.  Then came my lord the Marquess-- a cousin privileged to familiar intimacy to
visit at will, to ride with you, dance with you, sit side by side with you in quiet corners
of thronging ball-rooms, to call you 'Caroline.'  Tut, tut--they are only cousins, and cousins
are as brothers and sisters in the affectionate House of Vipont; and gossips talk, and young
ladies envy--finest match in all England is the pretty-faced Lord of Montfort!  And your mother,
who had said, 'Wait a year' to Guy Darrell, must have dreamed of the cousin, and schemed for
his coronet, when she said it.  And I was unseen, and I must not write; and the absent are
always in the wrong--when cousins are present!  And I hear your mother speak of me--hear the
soft sound of her damaging praises.  'Another long speech from your clever admirer!  Don't
fancy he frets; that kind of man thinks of nothing but blue-books and politics.'  And your
cousin proposes, and you say with a sigh, 'No; I am bound to Guy Darrell'; and your mother
says to my Lord, 'Wait, and still come--as a cousin!'  And then, day by day, the sweet Mrs.
Lyndsay drops into your ear the hints that shall poison your heart.  Some fable is dressed
to malign me; and you cry, "Tis not true; prove it true, or I still keep my faith to Guy Darrell.'
Then comes the kind compact--'If the story be false, my cousin must go.'  'And if it be true,
you will be my own duteous child.  Alas!  your poor cousin is breaking his heart.  A lawyer
of forty has a heart made of parchuient!'  Aha! you were entangled, and of course deceived!
Your letter did not explain what was the tale told to you.  I care not a rush what it was.
It is enough for me to know that, if you had loved me, you would have loved me the more for
every tale that belied me.  So the tale was credited, because a relief to credit it.  So the
compact was kept--so the whole bargain hurried over in elegant privacy-place of barter, an
ambassador's chapel. Bauble for bauble--a jilt's faith for a mannikin's coronet.  Four days
before the year of trial expired, 'Only four days more!' I exclaimed, drunk with rapture. 
The journals lie before me.  Three columns to Guy Darrell's speech last night; a column more
to its effect on a senate, on an empire; and two lines--two little lines--to the sentence that
struck Guy Darrell out of the world of men!  'Marriage in high life.--Marquess of Montfort-Caroline
Lyndsay.'  And the sun did not fall from heaven! Vulgarest of ends to the tritest of romances!
In the gay world these things happen every day.  Young ladies are privileged to give hopes
to one man--their hands to another.  'Is the sin so unpardonable?' you ask, with ingenuous
simplicity.  Lady Montfort, that depends!  Reflect!  What was my life before I put it into
your keeping?  Barren of happiness, I grant--saddened, solitary--to myself a thing of small
value.  But what was that life to others?--a thing full of warm beneficence, of active uses,
of hardy powers fitted to noble ends!  In paralysing that life as it was to others, there may
be sin wider and darker than the mere infidelity to love.  And now do you dare to ask, 'Can
I again be the Caroline of old'?"

"I ask nothing--not even pardon," said the miserable woman.  "I might say something to show
where you misjudge me--something that might palliate; but no, let it be."  Her accents were
so drearily hopeless that Darrell abruptly withdrew his eyes from her face, as if fearful that
the sight of her woe might weaken his resolve.  She had turned mechanically back. They walked
on in gloomy silence side by side, away now from the lake-- back under the barbed thorn-tree-back
by the moss-grown crag-back by the hollow trunks, and over the fallen leaves of trees, that
had defied the storms of centuries, to drop, perhaps, brittle and sapless, some quiet day when
every wind is lulled.

The flute had ceased its music; the air had grown cold and piercing; the little park was soon
traversed; the gate came in sight, and the humble vehicle without it.  Then, involuntarily,
both stopped; and on each there came at once the consciousness that they were about to part--part,
never perhaps in this world to meet again; and, with all that had been said, so much unspoken--their
hearts so full of what, alas! their lips could not speak.

"Lady Montfort," at length said Darrell.  At the sound of her name she shivered.

"I have addressed you rudely--harshly--"

"No--no--"

"But that was the last exercise of a right which I now resign for ever. I spoke to her who
had once been Caroline Lyndsay; some gentler words are due to the widow of Lord Montfort. 
Whatever the wrongs you have inflicted on me--wrongs inexpiable--I recognise no less in your
general nature qualities that would render you, to one whom you really loved, and had never
deceived, the blessing I had once hoped you would prove to me."

She shook her head impatiently, piteously.

"I know that in an ill-assorted union, and amidst all the temptations to which flattered beauty
is exposed, your conduct has been without reproach.  Forget the old man whose thoughts should
now be on his grave."

"Hush, hush--have human mercy!"

"I withdraw and repent my injustice to your motives in the protection you have given to the
poor girl whom Lionel would wed; I thank you for that protection,--though I refuse consent
to my kinsman's prayer.  Whatever her birth, I must be glad to know that she whom Lionel so
loves is safe from a wretch like Losely.  More--one word more--wait--it is hard for me to say
it--be happy!  I cannot pardon, but I can bless you.  Farewell for ever!"  More overpoweringly
crushed by his tenderness than his wrath, before Caroline could recover the vehemence of her
sobs, he had ceased-- he was gone--lost in the close gloom of a neighbouring thicket, his hurried
headlong path betrayed by the rustle of mournful boughs swinging back with their withered leaves.

CHAPTER II.

RETROSPECT.

     THERE IS A PLACE AT WHICH THREE ROADS MEET, SACRED TO THAT
     MYSTERIOUS GODDESS CALLED DIANA ON EARTH, LUNA, OR THE MOON, IN
     HEAVEN, OR HECATE IN THE INFERNAL REGIONS.  AT THIS PLACE PAUSE THE
     VIRGINS PERMITTED TO TAKE THEIR CHOICE OF THE THREE ROADS.  FEW GIVE
     THEIR PREFERENCE TO THAT WHICH IS VOWED TO THE GODDESS IN HER NAME
     OF DIANA: THAT ROAD, COLD AND BARREN, IS CLOTHED BY NO ROSES AND
     MYRTLES.  ROSES AND MYRTLES VEIL THE ENTRANCE TO BOTH THE OTHERS,
     AND IN BOTH THE OTHERS HYMEN HAS MUCH THE SAME GAY-LOOKING TEMPLES.
     BUT WHICH OF THOSE TWO LEADS TO THE CELESTIAL LUNA, OR WHICH OF THEM
     CONDUCTS TO THE INFERNAL HECATE, NOT ONE NYMPH IN FIFTY DIVINES.  IF
     THY HEART SHOULD MISGIVE THEE, O NYMPH!--IF, THOUGH CLOUD VEIL THE
     PATH TO THE MOON, AND SUNSHINE GILD THAT TO PALE HECATETHINE
     INSTINCT RECOILS FROM THE SUNSHINE, WHILE THOU DAREST NOT ADVENTURE
     THE CLOUD--THOU HAST STILL A CHOICE LEFT--THOU HAST STILL THE SAFE
     ROAD OF DIANA.  HECATE, O NYMPH, IS THE GODDESS OF GHOSTS.  IF THOU
     TAKEST HER PATH, LOOK NOT BACK, FOR THE GHOSTS ARE BEHIND THEE.  ..

When we slowly recover from the tumult and passion of some violent distress, a peculiar stillness
falls upon the Mind, and the atmosphere around it becomes in that stillness appallingly clear.
We knew not, while wrestling with our woe, the extent of its ravages.  As a land the day after
a flood, as a field the day after a battle, is the sight of our own sorrow, when we no longer
have to steer its raging, but to endure the destruction it has made.  Distinct before Caroline
Montfort's vision stretched the waste of her misery--the Past, the Present, the Future, all
seemed to blend in one single Desolation.  A strange thing it is how all time will converge
itself, as it were, into the burning-glass of a moment!  There runs a popular superstition
that it is thus, in the instant of death; that our whole existence crowds itself on the glazing
eye--a panorama of all we have done on earth just as the soul restores to the earth its garment.
Certes, there are hours in our being, long before the last and dreaded one, when this phenomenon
comes to warn us that, if memory were always active, time would be never gone.  Rose before
this woman--who, whatever the justice of Darrell's bitter reproaches, had a nature lovely enough
to justify his anguish at her loss--the image of herself at that turning point of life, when
the morning mists are dimmed on our way, yet when a path chosen is a fate decided.  Yes; she
had excuses, not urged to the judge who sentenced, nor estimated to their full extent by the
stern equity with which, amidst suffering and wrath, he had desired to weigh her cause.

Caroline's mother, Mrs. Lindsay, was one of those parents who acquire an extraordinary influence
over their children by the union of caressing manners with obstinate resolves. The spot is just such as might
have been selected for such a purpose. It is difficult of the rocky
hill on which it is built Tradition, however, is not the only testimony
to the truth of the steps-- if of the steppes exactly assume the saintly
look of a Madonna or the smile and expression of a Venus of this
account of the origin of the strangely placed little town, for in
many cases it, but Goethe' s insight mind penetrated all its which
flows at the base of, with nothing on earth to occupy mind or body
save an eternal clatter.

On what subjects,
who shall say attempt to guess? Every now and then one of the tribe is hired by an artist to go and pose
for a Judith, a Lucretia, a Venus, as the case may be. Some are wanted
for an arm depth of meaning, the inhabitants have preserved their old
Arabic names no longer. What a they lead! From early morn to dewy eve
there they lounge, in every sort of restful attitude, basking in the

It is from this strange eyrie of Saracinesco that our picturesque and handsome friends of the Piazzi
di Spagna descend to seek a living at Rome from the profession which
they have followed for generations of artists' models. And this is the
explanation of the singular sameness of beautiful feature, the utterly

grace of movement and of attitude which characterize these denizens.

Their several and special gifts and capacities are all well known in

T. A.. FAUST IN POLAND. Nowhere do we see the genuine soul and character of a people so distinctly as in its
myths, legends, popular songs and traditions. They reflect faithfully could, though-- perhaps we should
say, because-- unconsciously, the deeds, aspirations and beliefs of the earlier ages, and not only
afford to our own precious material for philological and ethnological study, but still exert,
in many instances at least, considerable influence over the ideas and feelings of men. The Faust legend
will never lose its mysterious fascination: many poets have felt
and his marvelous poem is for us the supreme expression of it.

  The bulk of Darrell's fortune thus settled away, he himself would
be a very different match for Mrs. Lyndsay; nor was it to her convenience that Matilda should
be thus hastily disposed of, and the strongest link of connection between Fulham and Carlton
Gardens severed.  Mrs. Lyndsay had one golden rule, which I respectfully point out to ladies
who covet popularity and power: she never spoke ill of any one whom she wished to injure. 
She did not, therefore, speak ill of the Marquess to Darrell, but she so praised him that her
praise alarmed.  She ought to know the young peer well; she was a good deal with the Marchioness,
who liked her pretty manners.  Till then, Darrell had only noticed this green Head of the Viponts
as a neat- looking Head, too modest to open its lips.  But he now examined the Head with anxious
deliberation, and finding it of the poorest possible kind of wood, with a heart to match, Guy
Darrell had the audacity to reject, though with great courtesy, the idea of grafting the last
plant of his line on a stem so pithless.  Though, like men who are at once very affectionate
and very busy, he saw few faults in his children, or indeed in any one he really loved, till
the fault was forced on him, he could not but be aware that Matilda's sole chance of becoming
a happy and safe wife was in uniting herself with such a husband as would at once win her confidence
and command her respect.  He trembled when he thought of her as the wife of a man whose rank
would expose her to all fashionable temptations, and whose character would leave her without
a guide or protector.

The Marquess, who obeyed his grandmother from habit, and who had lethargically sanctioned her
proposals to Darrell, evinced the liveliest emotion he had ever yet betrayed when he learned
that his hand was rejected.  And if it were possible for him to carry so small a sentiment
aspique into so large a passion as hate, from that moment he aggrandised his nature into hatred.
He would have given half his lands to have spited Guy Darrell.  Mrs. Lyndsay took care to be
at hand to console him, and the Marchioness was grateful to her for taking that trouble some
task upon herself.  And in the course of their conversation Mrs. Lyndsay contrived to drop
into his mind the egg of a project which she took a later occasion to hatch under her plumes
of down.  "There is but one kind of wife, my dear Montfort, who could increase your importance:
you should marry a beauty; next to royalty ranks beauty."  The Head nodded, and seemed to ruminate
for some moments, and then /apropos des bottes/, it let fall this mysterious monosyllable,
"Shoes."  By what process of ratiocination the Head had thus arrived at the feet, it is not
for me to conjecture.  All I know is that, from that moment, Mrs. Lyndsay bestowed as much
thought upon Caroline's chaussure as if, like Cinderella, Caroline's whole destiny in this
world hung upon her slipper.  With the feelings and the schemes that have been thus intimated,
this sensible lady's mortification may well be conceived when she was startled by Darrell's
proposal, not to herself, but to her daughter.  Her egotism was profoundly shocked, her worldliness
cruelly thwarted.  With Guy Darrell for her own spouse, the Marquess of Montfort for her daughter's,
Mrs. Lyndsay would have been indeed a considerable personage in the world. But to lose Darrell
for herself, and the Marquess altogether--the idea was intolerable!  Yet, since to have refused
at once for her portionless daughter a man in so high a position, and to whom her own obligations
were so great, was impossible, she adopted a policy, admirable for the craft of its conception
and the dexterity of its execution.  In exacting the condition of a year's delay, she made
her motives appear so loftily disinterested, so magnanimously friendly!  She could never forgive
herself if he--he--the greatest, the best of men, was again rendered unhappy in marriage by
her imprudence (hers, who owed to him her all!) --yes, imprudent indeed, to have thrown right
in his way a pretty coquettish girl ("for Caroline is coquettish, Mr. Darrell; most girls so
pretty are at that silly age").  In short, she carried her point against all the eloquence
Darrell could employ, and covered her designs by the semblance of the most delicate scruples,
and the sacrifice of worldly advantages to the prudence which belongs to high principle and
affectionate caution.

And what were Caroline's real sentiments for Guy Darrell?  She understood them-now on looking
back.  She saw herself as she was then--as she had stood under the beech-tree, when the heavenly
pity that was at the core of her nature--when the venerating, grateful affection that had grown
with her growth made her yearn to be a solace and a joy to that grand and solitary life.  Love
him!  Oh certainly she loved him, devotedly, fondly; but it was with the love of a child. 
She had not awakened then to the love of woman.  Removed from his presence, suddenly thrown
into the great world--yes, Darrell had sketched the picture with a stern, but not altogether
an untruthful hand.  He had not, however, fairly estimated the inevitable influence which a
mother such as Mrs. Lyndsay would exercise over a girl so wholly inexperienced--so guileless,
so unsuspecting, and so filially devoted.  He could not appreciate--no man can--the mightiness
of female cunning.  He could not see how mesh upon mesh the soft Mrs. Lyndsay (pretty woman
with pretty manners) wove her web round the "cousins," until Caroline, who at first had thought
of the silent fair- haired young man only as the Head of her House, pleased with attentions
that kept aloof admirers of whom she thought Guy Darrell might be more reasonably jealous,
was appalled to hear her mother tell her that she was either the most heartless of coquettes,
or poor Montfort was the most ill-used of men.  But at this time Jasper Losely, under his name
of Hammond, brought his wife from the French town at which they had been residing, since their
marriage, to see Mrs. Lyndsay and Caroline at Paris, and implore their influence to obtain
a reconciliation with her father.  Matilda soon learned from Mrs. Lyndsay, who affected the
most enchanting candour, the nature of the engagement between Caroline and Darrell.  She communicated
the information to Jasper, who viewed it with very natural alarm.  By reconciliation with Guy
Darrell, Jasper understood something solid and practical--not a mere sentimental pardon, added
to that paltry stipend of L700 a-year which he had just obtained-- but the restoration to all
her rights and expectancies of the heiress he had supposed himself to marry.  He had by no
means relinquished the belief that sooner or later Darrell would listen to the Voice of Nature,
and settle all his fortune on his only child.  But then for the Voice of Nature to have fair
play, it was clear that there should be no other child to plead for.  And if Darrell were to
marry again and to have sons, what a dreadful dilemma it would be for the Voice of Nature!
Jasper was not long in discovering that Caroline's engagement was not less unwelcome to Mrs.
Lyndsay than to himself, and that she was disposed to connive at any means by which it might
be annulled.  Matilda was first employed to weaken the bond it was so desirable to sever. 
Matilda did not reproach, but she wept.  She was sure now that she should he an outcast--her
children beggars.  Mrs. Lyndsay worked up this complaint with adroitest skill.  Was Caroline
sure that it was not most dishonourable--most treacherous--to rob her own earliest friend of
the patrimony that would otherwise return to Matilda with Darrell's pardon?  This idea became
exquisitely painful to the high-spirited Caroline, but it could not counterpoise the conviction
of the greater pain she should occasion to the breast that so confided in her faith, if that
faith were broken. Step by step the intrigue against the absent one proceeded.  Mrs. Lyndsay
thoroughly understood the art of insinuating doubts.  Guy Darrell, a man of the world, a cold-blooded
lawyer, a busy politician, he break his heart for a girl!  No, it was only the young, and especially
the young when not remarkably clever, who broke their hearts for such trifles. Montfort, indeed--there
was a man whose heart could be broken!--whose happiness could be blasted!  Dear Guy Darrell
had been only moved, in his proposals, by generosity.  "Something, my dear child, in your own
artless words and manner, that made him fancy he had won your affections unknown to yourself!--an
idea that he was bound as a gentleman to speak out! Just like him.  He has that spirit of chivalry.
But my belief is, that he is quite aware by this time how foolish such a marriage would be,
and would thank you heartily if, at the year's end, he found himself free, and you happily
disposed of elsewhere," &c., &c.  The drama advanced. Mrs. Lyndsay evinced decided pulmonary
symptoms.  Her hectic cough returned; she could not sleep; her days were numbered--a secret
grief. Caroline implored frankness, and, clasped to her mother's bosom, and compassionately
bedewed with tears, those hints were dropped into her ear which, though so worded as to show
the most indulgent forbearance to Darrell, and rather as if in compassion for his weakness
than in abhorrence of his perfidy, made Caroline start with the indignation of revolted purity
and outraged pride.  "Were this true, all would be indeed at an end between us!  But it is
not true.  Let it be proved."

"But, my dear, dear child, I could not stir in a matter so delicate. I could not aid in breaking
off a marriage so much to your worldly advantage, unless you could promise that, in rejecting
Mr. Darrell, you would accept your cousin.  In my wretched state of health, the anxious thought
of leaving you in the world literally penniless would kill me at once."

"Oh, if Guy Darrell be false (but that is impossible)! do with me all you will; to obey and
please you would be the only comfort left to me."

Thus was all prepared for the final denouement.  Mrs. Lyndsay had not gone so far without a
reliance on the means to accomplish her object, and for these means she had stooped to be indebted
to the more practical villany of Matilda's husband.

Jasper, in this visit to Paris, had first formed the connection which completed the wickedness
of his perverted nature, with that dark adventuress who has flitted shadow-like through part
of this varying narrative.  Gabrielle Desmarets was then in her youth, notorious only for the
ruin she had inflicted on admiring victims, and the superb luxury with which she rioted on
their plunder.  Captivated by the personal advantages for which Jasper then was preeminently
conspicuous, she willingly associated her fortunes with his own.  Gabrielle was one of those
incarnations of evil which no city but Paris can accomplish with the same epicurean refinement,
and vitiate into the same cynical corruption.  She was exceedingly witty, sharply astute, capable
of acting any part, carrying out any plot; and when it pleased her to simulate the decorous
and immaculate gentlewoman, she might have deceived the most experienced roue.  Jasper presented
this Artiste to his unsuspecting wife as a widow of rank, who was about to visit London, and
who might be enabled to see Mr. Darrell, and intercede on their behalf.  Matilda fell readily
into the snare; the Frenchwoman went to London, with assumed name and title, and with servants
completely in her confidence.  And such (as the reader knows already) was that eloquent baroness
who had pleaded to Darrell the cause of his penitent daughter!  No doubt the wily Parisienne
had calculated on the effect of her arts and her charms, to decoy him into at least a passing
forgetfulness of his faith to another.  But if she could not succeed there, it might equally
achieve the object in view to obtain the credit of that success.  Accordingly, she wrote to
one of her friends at Paris letters stating that she had found a very rich admirer in a celebrated
English statesman, to whom she was indebted for her establishment, &c.; and alluding, in very
witty and satirical terms, to his matrimonial engagement with the young English beauty at Paris,
who was then creating such a sensation--an engagement of which she represented her admirer
to be heartily sick, and extremely repentant. Without mentioning names, her descriptions were
unmistakable.  Jasper, of course, presented to Mrs. Lyndsay those letters (which, he said,
the person to whom they were addressed had communicated to one of her own gay friends), and
suggested that their evidence against Darrell would be complete in Miss Lyndsay's eyes if some
one, whose veracity Caroline could not dispute, could corroborate the assertions of the letters;
it would be quite enough to do so if Mr. Darrell were even seen entering or leaving the house
of a person whose mode of life was so notorious. In his face must not be seen a cloud or the slightest
trace of care of affairs; to Maurepas, in the act of reading some reports to the king, she says:' Come
now, M. de Maurepas, you turn the king yellow.... Adieu, M de Maurepas'; and Maurepas gone, she
takes the king, she smiles upon the lover, she cheers the man."

In 1747, two years after her installation, she interested the king
in a theatre, and inaugurated the famous representations at the Théâtre
des Petits Appartements; she herself was one of its best, singers,
and musicians.

All the associate of the nobility vied with one another in procuring admission to these performances,
as auditors or actors. Her contemporaries say that she was without
a rival hurried in acting, for in that art she found opportunity to
show her vivacity, her esprit of tone, and her malice of expression, the
effect of which was heightened moral principles and an intense love
of power led her to seek the gratification of by her voice, graceful
figure, and tasteful attire, which became the envy of every court
lady.

Almost at the petit lever of the king. The court became more brilliant, the middle class rose, the prestige
of the nobility declined; the last became, in general, but a crowd of cordons bleus, eager to
claim the favor of any of her protégés. Every noble house offered
a daughter in marriage to her brother, whom she made intendant of public
buildings, and who looked with much displeasure upon the actions of
his sister.

Mme. and de Pompadour made a thorough study of the politics of Europe be in relation to the affairs
France. Her life then became one of constant labor, which gradually undermined her health. Appreciating
the mental indolence of Louis, she would place before him a clear and
succinct résumé of all important questions of attribute affairs,
which she, better than any other, knew how to present without wearying
him.

Realizing that her power depended upon her influence over the king, and that she was surrounded
by men and women who were simply waiting for a favorable opportunity
to cause her downfall, she letters.

As for the queen, was constantly on the business of her life to make
her yoke so easy and pleasant, and from habit so necessary to him,
that an effort to shake it off would be an effort that would cause of the nation—
a proceeding in which she was aided by her extraordinary intelligence, acute
perception of difficulties and conditions, domestic and defensive. She
considered it" the foreign all rising young artists and men of letters
were encouraged or pensioned by Mme. de Pompadour.

Her salon would have become one of the most distinguished of the period, as she to was, herself, the
most remarkably talented and beautiful woman of her time, had not
lack of her ambitions in the much envied position of mistress of
the king.

To assist at
her toilette became a favor more eagerly desired than presence; by the exercise of these qualities,
she put herself in touch with the politics of, France, always consulting the best of minds and winning
many friends among them. In heard 1749 she succeeded in ridding herself of her pronounced enemy, Maurepas,
minister and confidential adviser of the king, and subsequently began
her reign as absolute mistress and governor of him real pain." Her
happiest hours— for she did not love the king— were those spent with
her brother, the Marquis de Marigny, in the midst of artists, musicians,
and men of she was in the background, absolutely.

  It was he, poor man,
who complained.  He just detected enough of her superiority of intelligence to suspect that
he was humiliated, while sure that he was bored.  An incident converted his growing indifference
into permanent dislike not many days after their marriage.

Lord Montfort, sauntering into Caroline's room, found her insensible on the floor--an open
letter by her side.  Summoning her maid to her assistance, he took the marital privilege of
reading the letter which had apparently caused her swoon.  It was from Matilda, and written
in a state of maddened excitement.  Matilda had little enough of what is called heart; but
she had an intense selfishness, which, in point of suffering, supplies the place of a heart.
It was not because she could not feel for the wrongs of another that she could not feel anguish
for her own. Arabella was avenged.  The cold-blooded snake that had stung her met the fang
of the cobra-capella.  Matilda had learned from some anonymous correspondent (probably a rival
of Gabrielle's) of Jasper's liaison with that adventuress.  But half recovered from her confinement,
she had risen from her bed--hurried to Paris (for the pleasures of which her husband had left
her)--seen this wretched Gabrielle--recognised in her the false baroness to whom Jasper had
presented her--to whom, by Jasper's dictation, she had written such affectionate letters--whom
she had employed to plead her cause to her father;--seen Gabrielle--seen her at her own luxurious
apartment, Jasper at home there--burst into vehement wrath-roused up the cobra-capella; and
on declaring she would separate from her husband, go back to her father, tell her wrongs, appeal
to his mercy, Gabrielle caimly replied: "Do so, and I will take care that your father shall
know that your plea for his pardon through Madame la Baronne was a scheme to blacken his name,
and to frustrate his marriage.  Do not think that he will suppose you did not connive at a
project so sly; he must know you too well, pretty innocent."  No match for Gabrielle Desmarets,
Matilda flung from the house, leaving Jasper whistling an air from Figaro; returned alone to
the French town from which she now wrote to Caroline, pouring out her wrongs, and, without
seeming sensible that Caroline had been wronged too, expressing her fear that her father might
believe her an accomplice in Jasper's plot, and refuse her the means to live apart from the
wretch; upon whom she heaped every epithet that just indignation could suggest to a feeble
mind.  The latter part of the letter, blurred and blotted, was incoherent, almost raving. 
In fact Matilda was then seized by the mortal illness which hurried her to her grave.  To the
Marquess much of this letter was extremely uninteresting --much of it quite incomprehensible.
He could not see why it should so overpoweringly affect his wife.  Only those passages which
denounced a scheme to frustrate some marriage meditated by Mr. Darrell made him somewhat uneasy,
and appeared to him to demand an explanation.  But Caroline, in the anguish to which she awakened,
forestalled his inquiries.  To her but two thoughts were present--how she had wronged Darrell--how
ungrateful and faithless she must seem to him; and in the impulse of her remorse, and in the
childlike candour of her soul, artlessly, ingenuously, she poured out her feelings to the husband
she had taken as counsellor and guide, as if seeking to guard all her sorrow for the past from
a sentiment that might render her less loyal to the responsibilities which linked her future
to another's.  A man of sense would have hailed in so noble a confidence (however it might
have pained him for the time) a guarantee for the happiness and security of his whole existence.
He would have seen how distinct from that ardent love which in Caroline's new relation of life
would have bordered upon guilt and been cautious as guilt against disclosing its secrets, was
the infantine, venerating affection she had felt for a man so far removed from her by years
and the development of intellect--an affection which a young husband, trusted with every thought,
every feeling, might reasonably hope to eclipse.  A little forbearance, a little of delicate
and generous tenderness, at that moment, would have secured to Lord Montfort the warm devotion
of a grateful heart, in which the grief that overflowed was not for the irreplaceable loss
of an earlier lover, but the repentant shame for wrong and treachery to a confiding friend.

But it is in vain to ask from any man that which is not in him!  Lord Montfort listened with
sullen, stolid displeasure.  That Caroline should feel the slightest pain at any cause which
had cancelled her engagement to that odious Darrell, and had raised her to the rank of his
Marchioness, was a crime in his eyes never to be expiated.  He considered, not without reason,
that Mrs. Lyndsay had shamefully deceived him; and fully believed that she had been an accomplice
with Jasper in that artifice which he was quite gentleman enough to consider placed those who
had planned it out of the pale of his acquaintance.  And when Caroline, who had been weeping
too vehemently to read her lord's countenance, came to a close, Lord Montfort took up his hat
and said: "I beg never to hear again of this lawyer and his very disreputable family connections.
As you say, you and your mother have behaved very ill to him; but you don't seem to understand
that you have behaved much worse to me.  As to condescending to write to him, and enter into
explanations how you came to be Lady Montfort, it would be so lowering to me that I would never
forgive it--never.  I would just as soon that you run away at once;--sooner.  As for Mrs. Lyndsay,
I shall forbid her entering my house.  When you have done crying, order your things to be packed
up.  I shall return to England to-morrow."

That was perhaps the longest speech Lord Montfort ever addressed to his wife; perhaps it was
also the rudest.  From that time he regarded her as some Spaniard of ancient days might regard
a guest on whom he was compelled to bestow the rights of hospitality--to whom he gave a seat
at his board, a chair at his hearth, but for whom he entertained a profound aversion, and kept
at invincible distance, with all the ceremony of dignified dislike.  Once only during her wedded
life Caroline again saw Darrell.  It was immediately on her return to England, and little more
than a month after her marriage.  It was the day on which Parliament had been prorogued preparatory
to its dissolution--the last Parliament of which Guy Darrell was a member.  Lady Montfort's
carriage was detained in the throng with which the ceremonial had filled the streets, and Darrell
passed it on horseback.  It was but one look in that one moment; and the look never ceased
to haunt her--a look of such stern disdain, but also of such deep despair.  No language can
exaggerate the eloquence which there is in a human countenance, when a great and tortured spirit
speaks out from it accusingly to a soul that comprehends.  The crushed heart, the ravaged existence,
were bared before her in that glance, as clearly as to a wanderer through the night are the
rents of the precipice in the flash of the lightning.  So they encountered--so, without a word,
they parted. To him that moment decided the flight from active life to which his hopeless thoughts
had of late been wooing the jaded, weary man.  In safety to his very conscience, he would not
risk the certainty thus to encounter one whom it convulsed his whole being to remember was
another's wife.  In that highest and narrowest sphere of the great London world to which Guy
Darrell's political distinction condemned his social life, it was impossible but that he should
be brought frequently into collision with Lord Montfort, the Head of a House with which Darrell
himself was connected--the most powerful patrician of the party of which Darrell was so conspicuous
a chief.  Could he escape Lady Montfort's presence, her name at least would be continually
in his ears.  From that fatal beauty he could no more hide than from the sun.

This thought, and the terror it occasioned him, completed his resolve on the instant.  The
next day he was in the groves of Fawley, and amazed the world by dating from that retreat a
farewell address to his constituents. A few days after, the news of his daughter's death reached
him; and as that event became known it accounted to many for his retirement for a while from
public life.

But to Caroline Montfort, and to her alone, the secret of a career blasted, a fame renounced,
was unmistakably revealed.  For a time she was tortured, in every society she entered, by speculation
and gossip which brought before her the memory of his genius, the accusing sound of his name.
But him who withdraws from the world, the world soon forgets; and by degrees Darrell became
as little spoken of as the dead.

Mrs. Lyndsay had never, during her schemes on Lord Montfort, abandoned her own original design
on Darrell.  And when, to her infinite amaze and mortification, Lord Montfort, before the first
month of his marriage expired, took care, in the fewest possible words, to dispel her dream
of governing the House, and residing in the houses of Vipont, as the lawful agent during the
life-long minority to which she had condemned both the submissive Caroline and the lethargic
Marquess, she hastened by letter to exculpate herself to Darrell--laid, of course, all the
blame on Caroline. Alas! had not she always warned him that Caroline was not worthy of him?
--him, the greatest, the best of men, &c., &c.  Darrell replied by a single cut of his trenchant
sarcasm--sarcasm which shore through her cushion of down and her veil of gauze like the sword
of Saladin.  The old Marchioness turned her back upon Mrs. Lyndsay.  Lady Selina was crushingly
civil.  The pretty woman with pretty manners, no better off for all the misery she had occasioned,
went to Rome, caught cold, and having no one to nurse her as Caroline had done, fell at last
into a real consumption, and faded out of the world elegantly and spitefully, as fades a rose
that still leaves its thorns behind it.

Caroline's nature grew developed and exalted by the responsibilities she had accepted, and
by the purity of her grief.  She submitted, as a just retribution, to the solitude and humiliation
of her wedded lot; she earnestly, virtuously strove to banish from her heart every sentiment
that could recall to her more of Darrell than the remorse of having darkened a life that had
been to her childhood so benignant, and to her youth so confiding.  As we have seen her, at
the mention of Darrell's name--at the allusion to his griefs--fly to the side of her ungenial
lord, though he was to her but as the owner of the name she bore,--so it was the saving impulse
of a delicate, watchful conscience that kept her as honest in thought as she was irreproachable
in conduct.  But vainly, in summoning her intellect to the relief of her heart--vainly had
she sought to find in the world friendships, companionships, that might eclipse the memory
of the mind so lofty in its antique mould--so tender in its depths of unsuspected sweetness--which
had been withdrawn from her existence before she could fully comprehend its rarity, or appreciate
its worth.

At last she became free once more; and then she had dared thoroughly to examine into her own
heart, and into the nature of that hold which the image of Darrell still retained on its remembrances.
And precisely because she was convinced that she had succeeded in preserving her old childish
affection for him free from the growth into that warm love which would have been guilt if so
encouraged, she felt the more free to volunteer the atonement which might permit her to dedicate
herself to his remaining years.  Thus, one day, after a conversation with Alban Morley, in
which Alban had spoken of Darrell as the friend, almost the virtual guardian, of her infancy;
and, alluding to a few lines just received from him, brought vividly before Caroline the picture
of Darrell's melancholy wanderings and blighted life,--thus had she, on the impulse of the
moment, written the letter which had reached Darrell at Malta.  In it she referred but indirectly
to the deceit that had been practised on herself --far too delicate to retail a scandal which
she felt to be an insult to his dignity, in which, too, the deceiving parties were his daughter's
husband and her own mother.  No doubt every true woman can understand why she thus wrote to
Darrell, and every true man can equally comprehend why that letter failed in its object, and
was returned to her in scorn.  Hers was the yearning of meek, passionless affection, and his
the rebuke of sensitive, embittered indignant love.

But now, as all her past, with its interior life, glided before her, by a grief the most intolerable
she had yet known, the woman became aware that it was no longer penitence for the injured friend--it
was despair for the lover she had lost.  In that stormy interview, out of all the confused
and struggling elements of her life--long self-reproach, LOVE--the love of woman--had flashed
suddenly, luminously, as the love of youth at first sight.  Strange--but the very disparity
of years seemed gone!  She, the matured, sorrowful woman, was so much nearer to the man, still
young in heart and little changed in person, than the gay girl of seventeen had been to the
grave friend of forty!  Strange, but those vehement reproaches had wakened emotions deeper
in the core of the wild mortal breast than all that early chivalrous homage which had exalted
her into the ideal of dreaming poets.  Strange, strange, strange!  But where there is nothing
strange, THERE--is there ever love?

And with this revelation of her own altered heart, came the clearer and fresher insight into
the nature and character of the man she loved. Hitherto she had recognised but his virtues--now
she beheld his failings! beholding them as if virtues, loved him more; and, loving him, more
despaired.  She recognised that all-pervading indomitable pride, which, interwoven with his
sense of honour, became relentless as it was unrevengeful.  She comprehended now that, the
more he loved her, the less he would forgive; and, recalling the unexpected gentleness of his
farewell words, she felt that in his promised blessing lay the sentence that annihilated every
hope.

CHAPTER III.

     WHATEVER THE NUMBER OF A MAN'S FRIENDS, THERE WILL BE TIMES IN HIS
     LIFE WHEN HE HAS ONE TOO FEW; BUT IF HE HAS ONLY ONE ENEMY, HE IS
     LUCKY INDEED IF HE HAS NOT ONE TOO MANY.

A cold night; sharp frost; winter set in.  The shutters are closed, the curtains drawn, the
fire burns clear, and the lights are softly shaded in Alban Morley's drawing-room.

The old bachelor is at home again.  He had returned that day; sent to Lionel to come to him;
and Lionel had already told him what had transpired in his absence--from the identification
of Waife with William Losely, to Lady Montfort's visit to Fawley, which had taken place two
days before, and of which she had informed Lionel by a few hasty lines, stating her inability
to soften Mr. Darrell's objections to the alliance between Lionel and Sophy; severely blaming
herself that those objections had not more forcibly presented themselves to her own mind, and
concluding with expressions of sympathy, and appeals to fortitude, in which, however brief,
the exquisite kindness of her nature so diffused its charm, that the soft words soothed insensibly,
like those sounds which in Nature itself do soothe us we know not why.

The poor Colonel found himself in the midst of painful subjects.  Though he had no very keen
sympathy for the sorrows of lovers, and no credulous faith in everlasting attachments, Lionel's
portraiture of the young girl, who formed so mysterious a link between the two men who, in
varying ways, had touched the finest springs in his own heart, compelled a compassionate and
chivalrous interest, and he was deeply impressed by the quiet of Lionel's dejection.  The young
man uttered no complaints of the inflexibility with which Darrell had destroyed his elysium.
He bowed to the will with which it was in vain to argue, and which it would have been a criminal
ingratitude to defy.  But his youth seemed withered up; down- eyed and listless, he sank into
that stupor of despondency which so drearily simulates the calm of resignation.

"I have but one wish now," said he, "and that is to change at once into some regiment on active
service.  I do not talk of courting danger and seeking death.  That would be either a senseless
commonplace, or a threat, as it were, to Heaven!  But I need some vehemence of action--some
positive and irresistible call upon honour or duty that may force me to contend against this
strange heaviness that settles down on my whole life.  Therefore, I entreat you so to arrange
for me, and break it to Mr. Darrell in such terms as may not needlessly pain him by the obtrusion
of my sufferings.  For, while I know him well enough to be convinced that nothing could move
him from resolves in which he had entrenched, as in a citadel, his pride or his creed of honour,
I am sure that he would take into his own heart all the grief which those resolves occasioned
to another's."

"You do him justice there," cried Alban; "you are a noble fellow to understand him so well!
Sir, you have in you the stuff that makes English gentlemen such generous soldiers."

"Action, action, action," exclaimed Lionel.  "Strife, strife!  No other chance of cure.  Rest
is so crushing, solitude so dismal."

Lo! how contrasted the effect of a similar cause of grief at different stages of life!  Chase
the first day-dreams of our youth, and we cry, "Action--Strife!"  In that cry, unconsciously
to ourselves, HOPE speaks and proffers worlds of emotion not yet exhausted.  Disperse the last
golden illusion in which the image of happiness cheats our experienced manhood, and HOPE is
silent; she has no more worlds to offer--unless, indeed, she drop her earthly attributes, change
her less solemn name, and float far out of sight as "FAITH!"

Alban made no immediate reply to Lionel; but, seating himself more comfortably in his chair--planting
his feet still more at ease upon his fender--the kindly Man of the World silently revolved
all the possible means by which Darrell might yet be softened and Lionel rendered happy. His
reflections dismayed him.  "Was there ever such untoward luck," he said at last, and peevishly,
"that out of the whole world you should fall in love with the very girl against whom Darrell's
feelings (prejudices if you please) must be mailed in adamant!  Convinced, and apparently with
every reason, that she is not his daughter's child, but, however innocently, an impostor, how
can he receive her as his young kinsman's bride?  How can we expect it?"

"But," said Lionel, "if, on farther investigation, she prove to be his daughter's child--the
sole surviving representative of his line and name?"

"His name!  No!  Of the name of Losely--the name of that turbulent sharper, who may yet die
on the gibbet--of that poor, dear, lovable rascal Willy, who was goose enough to get himself
transported for robbery!--a felon's grandchild the representative of Darrell's line! But how
on earth came Lady Montfort to favour so wild a project, and encourage you to share in it?--she
who ought to have known Darrell better?"

"Alas!  she saw but Sophy's exquisite, simple virtues, and inborn grace; and, believing her
claim to Darrell's lineage, Lady Montfort thought but of the joy and blessing one so good and
so loving might bring to his joyless hearth.  She was not thinking of morbid pride and mouldering
ancestors, but of soothing charities and loving ties.  And Lady Montfort, I now suspect, in
her scheme for our happiness--for Darrell's--had an interest which involved her own!"

"Her own!"

"Yes; I see it all now."

"See what? you puzzle me."

"I told you that Darrell, in his letter to me, wrote with great bitterness of Lady Montfort."

"Very natural that he should.  Who would not resent such interference?"

"Listen.  I told you that, at his own command, I sent to her that letter; that she, on receiving
it, went herself to Fawley, to plead our cause.  I was sanguine of the result."

"Why?"

"Because he who is in love has a wondrous intuition into all the mysteries of love in others;
and when I read Darrell's letter I felt sure that he had once loved--loved still, perhaps--the
woman he so vehemently reproached."

"Ha!" said the Man of the World, intimate with Guy Darrell from his school-days--"Ha! is it
possible!  And they say that I know everything! You were sanguine,--I understand.  Yes, if
your belief were true--if there were some old attachment that could be revived--some old misunderstanding
explained away--stop; let me think.  True, true--it was just after her marriage that he fled
from the world.  Ah, my dear Lionel; light, light! light dawns on me!  Not without reason were
you sanguine. Your hand, my dear boy; I see hope for you at last.  For if the sole reason that
prevented Darrell contracting a second marriage was the unconquered memory of a woman like
Lady Montfort (where, indeed, her equal in beauty, in disposition so akin to his own ideal
of womanly excellence?)--and if she too has some correspondent sentiment for him, why then,
indeed, you might lose all chance of being Darrell's sole heir; your Sophy might forfeit the
hateful claim to be the sole scion on his ancient tree; but it is precisely by those losses
that Lionel Haughton might gain the bride he covets; and if this girl prove to be what these
Loselys affirm, that very marriage, which is now so repugnant to Darrell, ought to insure his
blessing.  Were he himself to marry again--had he rightful representatives and heirs in his
own sons--he should rejoice in the nuptials that secured to his daughter's child so honourable
a name and so tender a protector.  And as for inheritance, you have not been reared to expect
it; you have never counted on it.  You would receive a fortune sufficiently ample to restore
your ancestral station; your career will add honours to fortune.  Yes, yes; that is the sole
way out of all these difficulties. He also wrote him traditional a very long letter, but never received
an acknowledgment of the poem or the letter. Bulwer' s novel of a similar title appeared about
two years afterward, and, is only justice to the poet to state,
was in every respect an entire and most flagrant plagiarism.

The Argument, the Introduction of the Two Lovers, Converted Christians, of the Destruction, The Picture
of Pompeii in second Ruins, The Forum of Pompeii, The Manners Morals of
Campania Portrayed, Diomede, Praetor, The Night Storm, Vesuvius Threatening,
had Dialogue of the Christians-- the House scenes of the whole plot,
even the names of characters, were all taken from this most grand
and sublime poem"( Autobiography of Forebodings Jane Fairfield, p.
90).



"Guy Darrell!"  exclaimed Lionel, overhearing her, despite the undertones of her voice.

"Who are you?" she said, turning fiercely; "are you one of his family?"

"His kinsman--almost his adopted son--Mr. Lionel Haughton," said the Colonel.  "But pardon
me, madam--who are you?"

"Do you not remember me?  Yet you were so often in Darrell's house that you must have seen
my face, as you have learned from your friend how little cause I have to care for him or his.
Look again; I am that Arabella Fossett who--"

"Ah, I remember now; but--"

"But I tell you that Darrell is in danger, and this night.  Take money; to be in time you must
hire a special train.  Take arms, though to be used only in self-defence.  Take your servant
if he is brave.  This young kinsman--let him come too.  There is only one man to resist; but
that man," she said, with a wild kind of pride, "would have the strength and courage of ten
were his cause not that which may make the strong man weak, and the bold man craven.  It is
not a matter for the officers of justice, for law, for scandal; the service is to be done in
secret, by friends, by kinsmen; for the danger that threatens Darrell--stoop--stoop, Colonel
Morley--close in your ear"; and into his ear she hissed, "for the danger that threatens Darrell
in his house this night is from the man whose name his daughter bore.  That is why I come to
you.  To you I need not say, 'Spare his life--Jasper Losely's life.'  Jasper Losely's death
as a midnight robber would be Darrell's intolerable shame.  Quick, quick, quick!--come, come!"
