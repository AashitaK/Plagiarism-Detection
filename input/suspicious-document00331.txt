THE SPORTSMAN

by Xenophon

Translation by H. G. Dakyns

          Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a
          pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,
          and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land
          and property in Scillus, where he lived for many
          years before having to move once more, to settle
          in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.

          The Sportsman is a manual on hunting hares, deer
          and wild boar, including the topics of dogs, and
          the benefits of hunting for the young.

     PREPARER'S NOTE

     This was typed from Dakyns' series, "The Works of Xenophon," a
     four-volume set. The complete list of Xenophon's works (though
     there is doubt about some of these) is:

ON HUNTING

A Sportsman's Manual

Commonly Called CYNEGETICUS

I

To the gods themselves is due the discovery, to Apollo and Artemis, patrons of the chase and
protectors of the hound. (1) As a guerdon they bestowed it upon Cheiron, (2) by reason of his
uprightness, and he took it and was glad, and turned the gift to good account. At his feet
sat many a disciple, to whom he taught the mystery of hunting and of chivalry (3)--to wit,
Cephalus, Asclepius, Melanion, Nestor, Amphiaraus, Peleus, Telamon, Meleager, Theseus and Hippolytus,
Palamedes, Odysseus, Menestheus, Diomed, Castor and Polydeuces, Machaon and Podaleirius, Antilochus,
Aeneas and Achilles: of whom each in his turn was honoured by the gods. And let none marvel
that of these the greater part, albeit well-pleasing to the gods, nevertheless were subject
to death--which is the way of nature, (4) but their fame has grown--nor yet that their prime
of manhood so far differed. The lifetime of Cheiron sufficed for all his scholars; the fact
being that Zeus and Cheiron were brethren, sons of the same father but of different mothers--Zeus
of Rhea, and Cheiron of the nymph Nais; (5) and so it is that, though older than all of them,
he died not before he had taught the youngest--to wit, the boy Achilles. (6)
