Yet it was still in a pitiable state of weakness and destitution. The care and maintenance
of the settlement had devolved upon trading companies, and their narrow-minded mercantile selfishness
had stifled its progress. From other causes, also, there had been but little growth. Cardinal
Richelieu, the great French minister, had tried at one time to infuse new life into the colony;
[Footnote: For the earlier history of New France the reader is referred to three other volumes
in this Series--The Founder of New France, The Seigneurs of Old Canada, and The Jesuit Missions.]
but his first attempts had been unlucky, and later on his powerful mind was diverted to other
plans and achievements and he became absorbed in the wider field of European politics. To the
shackles of commercial greed, to forgetfulness on the part of the mother country, had been
added the curse of Indian wars. During twenty-five years the daring and ferocious Iroquois
had been the constant scourge of the handful of settlers, traders, and missionaries. Champlain's
successors in the office of governor, Montmagny, Ailleboust, Lauzon, Argenson, Avaugour, had
no military force adequate to the task of meeting and crushing these formidable foes. Year
after year the wretched colony maintained its struggle for existence amidst deadly perils,
receiving almost no help from France, and to all appearance doomed to destruction. To make
things worse, internal strife exercised its disintegrating influence; there was contention
among the leaders in New France over the vexed question of the liquor traffic. In the face
of so many adverse circumstances--complete lack of means, cessation of immigration from the
mother country, the perpetual menace of the bloody Iroquois incursions, a dying trade, and
a stillborn agriculture--how could the colony be kept alive at all? Spiritual and civil authorities,
the governor and the bishop, the Jesuits and the traders, all united in petitioning for assistance.
But the motherland was far away, and European wars and rivalries were engrossing all her attention.

Fortunately a change was at hand. The prolonged struggle of the Thirty Years' War and of the
war against Spain had been ended by the treaty of Munster and Osnabruck in 1648 and by that
of the Pyrenees in 1659. The civil dissensions of the Fronde were over, thanks to the skilful
policy of Cardinal Mazarin, Richelieu's successor. After the death of Mazarin in 1661, Louis
XIV had taken into his own hands the reins of administration. He was young, painstaking, and
ambitious; and he wanted to be not only king but the real ruler of his kingdom. In Jean Baptiste
Colbert, the man who had been Mazarin's right hand, he had the good fortune to find one of
the best administrators in all French history. Colbert soon won the king's confidence. He was
instrumental in detecting the maladministration of Fouquet as superintendent of Finance, and
became a member of the council appointed to investigate and report on all financial questions.
Of this body he was the leading spirit from the beginning. Although at first without the title
of minister, he was promptly invested with a wide authority over the finances, trade, agriculture,
industry, and marine affairs. Within two years he had shown his worth and had justified the
king's choice. Great and beneficial reforms had been accomplished in almost every branch of
the administration. The exhausted treasury had been replenished, trade and industry were encouraged,
agriculture was protected, and a navy created. Under a progressive government France seemed
to awake to new life.

The hour was auspicious for the entreaties of New France. Petitions and statements were addressed
to the king by Mgr de Laval, the head of ecclesiastical affairs in the colony, by the governor
Avaugour, and by the Jesuit fathers; and Pierre Boucher, governor of the district of Three
Rivers, was sent to France as a delegate to present them. Louis and his minister studied the
conditions of the colony on the St Lawrence and decided in 1663 to give it a new constitution.
The charter of the One Hundred Associates was cancelled and the old Council of Quebec--formed
in 1647--was reorganized under the name of the Sovereign Council. This new governing body was
to be composed of the governor, the bishop, the intendant, an attorney-general, a secretary,
and five councillors. It was invested with a general jurisdiction for the administration of
justice in civil and criminal matters. It had also to deal with the questions of police, roads,
finance, and trade.

To establish a new and improved system of administration was a good thing, but this alone would
hardly avail if powerful help were not forthcoming to rescue New France from ruin, despondency,
and actual extermination. The colony was dying for lack of soldiers, settlers, and labourers,
as well as stores of food and munitions of war for defence and maintenance. Louis XIV made
up his mind that help should be given. In 1664 three hundred labourers were conveyed to Quebec
at the king's expense, and in the following year the colonists received the welcome information
that the king was also about to send them a regiment of trained soldiers, a viceroy, a new
governor, a new intendant, settlers and labourers, and all kinds of supplies. This royal pledge
was adequately fulfilled. On June 19, 1665, the Marquis de Tracy, lieutenant-general of all
the French dominions in America, arrived from the West Indies, where he had successfully discharged
the first part of the mission entrusted to him by his royal master. With him came four companies
of soldiers. During the whole summer ships were disembarking their passengers and unloading
their cargoes of ammunition and provisions at Quebec in quick succession. It is easy to imagine
the rapture of the colonists at such a sight, and the enthusiastic shouts that welcomed the
first detachment of the splendid regiment of Carignan-Salieres. At length, on September 12,
the cup of public joy was filled to overflowing by the arrival of the ship Saint Sebastien
with two high officials on board, David de Remy, Sieur de Courcelle, the governor appointed
to succeed the governor Mezy, who had died earlier in the year, and Jean Talon, the intendant
of justice, police, and finance. The latter had been selected to replace the Sieur Robert,
who had been made intendant in 1663, but, for some unknown reason, had never come to Canada
to perform the duties of his office. The triumvirate on whom was imposed the noble task of
saving and reviving New France was thus complete. The Marquis de Tracy was an able and clear-sighted
commander, the Sieur de Courcelle a fearless, straightforward official. But the part of Jean
Talon in the common task, though apparently less brilliant, was to be in many respects the
most important, and his influence the most far-reaching in the destinies of the colony.

Talon was born at Chalons-sur-Marne, in the province of Champagne, about the year 1625. His
family were kinsfolk of the Parisian Talons, Omer and Denis, the celebrated jurists and lawyers,
who held in succession the high office of attorney-general of France. Several of Jean Talon's
brothers were serving in the administration or the army, and, after a course of study at the
Jesuits' College of Clermont, Jean was employed under one of them in the commissariat. The
young man's abilities soon became apparent and attracted Mazarin's attention. In 1654 he was
appointed military commissary at Le Quesnoy in connection with the operations of the army commanded
by the great Turenne. A year later, at the age of thirty, he was promoted to be intendant for
the province of Hainault. For ten years he filled that office and won the reputation of an
administrator of the first rank. Thus it came about that, when an intendant was needed to infuse
new blood into the veins of the feeble colony on the St Lawrence, Colbert, always a good judge
of men, thought immediately of Jean Talon and recommended to the king his appointment as intendant
of New France. Talon's commission is dated March 23, 1665.

The minister drafted for the intendant's guidance a long letter of instructions. It dealt with
the mutual relations of Church and State, and set forth the Gallican principles of the day;
it discussed the question of assistance to the recently created West India Company; the contemplated
war against the Iroquois and how it might successfully be carried on; the Sovereign Council
and the administration of justice; the settlement of the colony and the advisability of concentrating
the population; the importance of fostering trade and industry; the question of tithes for
the maintenance of the Church; the establishment of shipbuilding yards and the encouragement
of agriculture. This document was signed by Louis XIV at Paris on March 27, 1665.

On receiving his commission and his instructions, Talon took leave of the king and the minister,
and proceeded to make preparations for his arduous mission and for the long journey which it
involved. By April 22 he was at La Rochelle, to arrange for the embarkation of settlers, working
men, and supplies. He attended the review of the troops that were bound for New France, and
reported to Colbert that the companies were at their full strength, well equipped and in the
best of spirits. During this time he spared no pains to acquire information about the new country
where he was to work and live. Finally, by May 24, everything was in readiness, and he wrote
to Colbert:

   Since apparently I shall not have the honour of writing
   you another letter from this place, for our ship awaits
   only a favourable wind to sail, allow me to assure
   you that I am leaving full of gratitude for all the
   kindness and favours bestowed on me by the king and
   yourself. Knowing that the best way to show my gratitude
   is to do good service to His Majesty, and that the
   best title to future benevolence lies in strenuous
   effort for the successful execution of his wishes, I
   shall do my utmost to attain that end in the charge
   I am going to fill. I pray for your protection and
   help, which will surely be needed, and if my endeavours
   should not be crowned with success, at least it will
   not be for want of zeal and fidelity.

A few hours after having written these farewell lines, Talon, in company with M. de Courcelle,
set sail on the Saint Sebastien for Canada, where he was to make for himself an imperishable name.

CHAPTER II

NEW FRANCE IN 1665

Let us take a glance over the colony at the time when Courcelle and Talon landed at Quebec
after an ocean journey--there were no fast lines then--of one hundred and seventeen days.

In 1665 Canada had only three settled districts: Quebec, Three Rivers, and Ville-Marie or Montreal.
Quebec, the chief town, bore the proud title of the capital of New France. Yet it contained
barely seventy houses with about five hundred and fifty inhabitants. Then, as now, it consisted
of a lower and an upper town. In the lower town were to be found the king's stores and the
merchants' shops and residences. The public officials and the clergy and members of the religious
orders lived in the upper town, where stood the principal buildings of the capital--the Chateau
Saint-Louis, the Bishop's Palace, the Cathedral, the Jesuits' College and Chapel, and the monasteries
of the Ursulines and of the Hotel-Dieu sisters.

Francois de Laval de Montmorency, bishop of Petraea and vicar apostolic for Canada, was the
spiritual head of the colony. He had arrived from France six years earlier, in 1659, and was
destined to spend the remainder of his life, nearly half a century, in the service of the Church
in Canada. Because of his noble character and many virtues, his strong intellect, and his devotion
to the public weal, he will ever rank as one of the greatest figures in Canadian history. His
vicar-general was Henri de Bernieres, who was also parish priest of Quebec and superior of
the seminary founded by the bishop in 1663. The superior of the Jesuits was Father Le Mercier.
The saintly Marie de l'Incarnation was mother superior of the Ursulines, and Mother Saint Bonaventure
of the Hotel-Dieu.

It may be interesting to recall the names of some of the notable citizens of Quebec at that
time, other than the high officials. There were Michel Filion and Pierre Duquet, notaries;
Jean Madry, surgeon to the king's majesty; Jean Le Mire, the future syndic des habitants; Madame
d'Ailleboust, widow of a former governor; Madame Couillard, widow of Guillaume Couillard and
daughter of Louis Hebert, the first tiller of the soil; Madame de Repentigny, widow of 'Admiral'
de Repentigny, to use the grandiloquent expression of old chroniclers; Nicolas Marsollet, Louis
Couillard de l'Espinay, Charles Roger de Colombiers, Francois Bissot, Charles Amiot, Le Gardeur
de Repentigny, Dupont de Neuville, Pierre Denis de la Ronde, all men of high standing. The
chief merchants were Charles Basire, Jacques Loyer de Latour, Claude Charron, Jean Maheut,
Eustache Lambert, Bertrand Chesnay de la Garenne, Guillaume Feniou. Charles Aubert de la Chesnaye,
the stalwart Quebec trader of the day, was then in France.

In the neighbourhood of Quebec were a few settlements. According to the census of the following
year there were 452 persons on the Island of Orleans, 533 at the Cote Beaupre, 185 at Beauport,
140 at Sillery, and 112 at Charlesbourg and Notre-Dame-des-Anges on the St Charles river.

Three Rivers was a small port with a population of 455, including that of the adjoining settlements.
The governor in charge of the local administration was Pierre Boucher, already mentioned as
a delegate to France in 1661. The Jesuits had a residence there and a chapel which was the
only place of public worship, for the colonists had not as yet the means to erect a parish
church. In the vicinity there were the beginnings of settlement at Cap-de-la- Magdeleine, Batiscan,
and Champlain. Among the important families of Three Rivers were those of Godefroy, Hertel,
Le Neuf, Crevier, Boucher, Poulin, Volant, Lemaitre, Rivard, and Ameau. Michel Le Neuf du Herisson
was juge royal, and Severin Ameau was notary and registrar of the court.

Montreal or Ville-Marie was scarcely more important than Three Rivers. The population of the
whole district numbered only 625. A fort built by Maisonneuve and Ailleboust at Pointe-a-Callieres;
the house of the Sulpicians at the foot of the present Saint-Sulpice Street; the Hotel-Dieu
on the other side of that street; the convent of the Congregation sisters facing the Hotel-Dieu;
a few houses scattered along the road called 'de la Commune,' now Saint-Paul Street; and on
the rising ground towards the Place d'Armes of later years a few more dwellings--these constituted
the Montreal of primitive days. On the top of the hill called 'Coteau Saint-Louis' was erected
an intrenched mill--'Moulin du Coteau'--which could be used as a redoubt to protect the inhabitants.
The Sulpicians' house, the Hotel-Dieu, the convent of the Congregation, and the houses of the
Place d'Armes and of 'la Commune' were connected with the fort by footpaths. Before 1672 there
were no streets laid out. The only place of public worship was the Hotel-Dieu chapel, fifty
feet in length by thirty in width. The superior of the Sulpicians was Abbe Souart. Mother Mace
was superioress of the Hotel-Dieu, but the mainstay of the institution was the well-known Mademoiselle
Mance, who, by the aid of Madame de Bullion's benefactions, had founded it in 1643. The illustrious
Sister Marguerite Bourgeoys was at the head of the Congregation, which owed its existence to
her pious zeal and devotion to the education of the young. Among the 'Montrealistes' of note
the following should be specially mentioned: Zacharie Dupuy, major of the island; Charles d'Ailleboust,
seigneurial judge; J. B. Migeon de Bransac, fiscal attorney; Louis Artus Sailly, who had been
for some time juge royal; Benigne Basset, at once registrar of the seigneurial court, notary,
and surveyor; Charles Le Moyne, king's treasurer, interpreter, soldier, settler, who was later
to be ennobled and receive the title of Baron de Longueuil; Etienne Bouchard, surgeon; Pierre
Picote de Belestre, a valiant militia officer; Claude de Robutel, Sieur de Saint-Andre; Jacques
Leber, a merchant who controlled almost the whole trade of Ville-Marie.

Altogether the white population of Canada, including the settlers and labourers arriving during
the summer of 1665, numbered only 3215. Yet the colony had been in existence for fifty-seven
years! It was certainly time for a new effort on the part of the mother country to infuse life
into her feeble offspring. This was a task calling for the earnest care and the most energetic
activity of Tracy, Courcelle, and Talon.

One of the first matters to receive their attention was the reorganization of the Canadian
administration. We have seen that in 1663 the Sovereign Council had been created, to consist
of the high officials of the colony and five councillors. At this time, September 1665, the
five councillors were Mathieu Damours, Le Gardeur de Tilly, and three others who had been irregularly
appointed by Mezy, the preceding governor, to take the places of three councillors whom he
had arbitrarily dismissed--Rouer de Villeray, Juchereau de la Ferte, and Ruette d'Auteuil.
The same governor had also dismissed Jean Bourdon, the attorney-general, and had replaced him
by Chartier de Lotbiniere. These summary dismissals and appointments had arisen out of a quarrel
between the governor and the bishop, in which the former appears to have been influenced by
petty motives. At any rate Mezy had been recalled by the king; and Tracy, Courcelle, and Talon
had been instructed to try him for improper conduct in office. But before their arrival at
Quebec, Mezy had obeyed the summons of another King than the king of France. He had been taken
ill in the spring of the year and had died on May 6. Mezy being dead, it was wisely thought
unnecessary to recall unhappy memories of his errors and misdeeds. Sufficient would be done
if the grievances due to his rashness were redressed. Accordingly the dismissed officials were
reinstated, and on September 23, 1665, a solemn sitting of the Sovereign Council was held,
at which Tracy, Courcelle, Laval, and Talon were present, together with the Sieur Le Barroys,
general agent of the West India Company, and the Sieurs de Villeray, de la Ferte, d'Auteuil,
de Tilly, Damours--all the councillors in office before Mezy's dismissals--Jean Bourdon, the
attorney-general, and J. B. Peuvret, secretary of the council. The letters patent of Courcelle
and Talon as well as the commission and credentials of the Sieur Le Barroys were duly read
and registered; the letters patent of the Marquis de Tracy had been registered previously.
With these formalities the new administration of Canada was inaugurated.

The next proceeding of the rulers of New France was to prepare for a decisive blow against
the daring Iroquois. Tracy and the soldiers, as we have seen, had arrived in June and three
forts were in course of building on the Richelieu river, or 'riviere des Iroquois,' so called
because for a long period it had been the most direct highway leading from the villages of
these bloody warriors to the heart of the colony. During the summer and autumn of 1665 the
Carignan soldiers were kept busy with the construction of these necessary defensive works.
The first fort was erected at the mouth of the river, under the direction of Captain de Sorel;
the second fifty miles higher, under Captain de Chambly; and the third about nine miles farther
up, under Colonel de Salieres. The first two retained the names of the officers in charge of
their construction, and the third received the name of Sainte-Therese because it was finished
on the day dedicated to that saint. During the following year two other forts were built--St
John, a few miles distant from Sainte-Therese, and Sainte-Anne, on an island at the head of
Lake Champlain. Both Tracy and Courcelle went to inspect the work personally and encourage
the garrisons.

In the meantime Talon was in no way idle. He had to organize the means of conveying provisions,
ammunition, tools, and supplies of every description for the maintenance of the troops and
the furtherance of the work. Under his supervision a flotilla of over fifty boats plied between
Quebec and the river Richelieu. It was also his business to take care of the incoming soldiers
and labourers and to see that those who had contracted disease during their journey across
the ocean received proper nursing and medical attendance.

From the moment of his arrival he had lost no opportunity of acquiring information on the situation
in the colony. There is a curious anecdote that illustrates the manner in which he sometimes
contrived to gain knowledge by concealing his identity. On the very day of his landing he went
alone to the Hotel-Dieu, and asking for the superioress, introduced himself as the valet de
chambre of the intendant, pretending to be sent by his master to assure the good ladies of
the hospital of M. Talon's kindly disposition and desire to bestow on them every favour in
his gift. One of the sisters present at the interview--Mere de la Nativite, a very bright and
clever woman--was struck by the extreme distinction of manner and speech of the so-called valet,
and, with a meaning glance at the superioress, told the visitor that unless she was mistaken
he was more than he pretended to be. On his asking what could convey to her that impression,
she replied that by his bearing and language she could not but feel that the intendant himself
was honouring the Hotel-Dieu with a visit. Talon could do no less than confess that she was
right, showing at the same time that he appreciated the delicate compliment thus paid to him.
From that day he was a devoted and most generous friend to the Hotel-Dieu of Quebec.

One of the first problems with which the intendant had to deal in discharging the duties of
his office was the dualism of administrative authority. It has been mentioned that Colbert
had founded a new trading company, known as the West India Company. This corporation had been
granted wide privileges over all the French possessions in America, including feudal ownership
and authority to administer justice and levy war. The company was thus invested with the right
of appointing judicial officers, magistrates, and sovereign councils, and of naming, subject
to the king's sanction governors and other functionaries; it had full power to sell the land
or make grants in feudal tenure, to receive all seigneurial dues, to build forts, raise troops,
and equip war-ships. The company's charter had been granted in 1664, and of course Canada,
as well as the other French colonies in the New World, was included in its jurisdiction. The
situation of this colony was therefore very peculiar. In 1663 the king had cancelled the charter
of the One Hundred Associates and had taken back the fief of Canada; but a year later he had
granted it again to a new company. At the same time he showed clearly that he intended to keep
the administration in his own hands. Thus Canada seemed to have two masters. In accordance
with its charter, the company held the ownership and government of the country de jure. But
in point of fact the king wielded the government, thus taking back with one hand what he had
given with the other. By right the company controlled the administration of justice; it could,
and actually did, establish courts. But, in fact, the king appointed the intendant supreme
judge in civil cases, and made the Sovereign Council a tribunal of superior jurisdiction. By
right, to the company belonged the power of granting land and seigneuries. In fact, the governor
or the intendant, the king's officers, made the grants at their pleasure. This strange situation,
which lasted ten years--until the West India Company's charter was revoked in 1674--is often
confusing to the student of the period.

Talon saw at a glance the anomaly of the situation; but, being a practical man, he was less
displeased with the falsity of the principle than apprehensive of the evil that was likely
to result. In a letter to Colbert, dated October 4, 1665, he discussed the subject at length,
putting it in plain terms. If, when the grant was made, it was the king's intention to benefit
only the company--to increase its profits and develop its trade--with no ulterior consideration
for the development of the colony, then it would be well to leave to the company the sole ownership
of the country. But if His Majesty had thought of making Canada one of the prosperous parts
of his kingdom, it was very doubtful whether he could attain that end without keeping in his
own hands the control of lands and trade. The real aim of the West India Company, as he had
learned, was to enforce its commercial monopoly to the utmost; and become the only trading
medium between the colony and the mother country. Such a policy could have but one result;
it would put an end to private enterprise and discourage immigration.

In spite of the company's apparent overlordship, Talon thought that, as the king's agent, he
was bound to exercise the powers appertaining to his office for the good of the colony. By
the end of the year 1665 he had planned a new settlement in the vicinity of Quebec on lands
included in the limits of the seigneury of Notre-Dame- des-Anges at Charlesbourg, which he
had withdrawn from the grant to the Jesuits, under the king's authority. This was the occasion
of some friction between the Jesuits and the intendant. Talon gave the necessary orders for
the erection of about forty dwellings which should be ready to receive new settlers during
the following year. These were to be grouped in three adjacent villages named Bourg-Royal,
Bourg-la-Reine, and Bourg-Talon. We shall learn more of them in a following chapter.

Another enterprise of the intendant was numbering the people. Under his personal supervision,
during the winter of 1666-67, a general census of the colony was taken--the first Canadian
census of which we have any record. The count showed, as we have already said, a total population
of 3215 in Canada at that time--2034 males and 1181 females. The married people numbered 1109,
and there were 528 families. Elderly people were but few in number, 95 only being from fifty-one
to sixty years old, 43 from sixty-one to seventy, 10 from seventy-one to eighty, and 4 from
eighty-one to ninety. In regard to professions and occupations, there were then in New France
3 notaries, 5 surgeons, 18 merchants, 4 bailiffs, 3 schoolmasters, 36 carpenters, 27 joiners,
30 tailors, 8 coopers, 5 bakers, 9 millers, 3 locksmiths. The census did not include the king's
troops, which formed a body of 1200 men. The clergy consisted of the bishop, 18 Priests and
aspirants to the priesthood, and 35 Jesuit fathers. There were also 19 Ursulines, 23 Hospitalieres,
and 4 Sisters of the Congregation. The original record of this, the first Canadian census,
has been preserved and is without question a most important historical document. It is likewise
full of living interest, for in it are recorded the names of many families whose descendants
are now to be found all over Canada.

CHAPTER III

THE IROQUOIS SUBDUED

It was the special task of Tracy and Courcelle to rid the colony of the Iroquois scourge. The
Five Nations [Footnote: The Iroquois league consisted of five tribes or nations--the Mohawks,
the Cayugas, the Senecas, the Onondagas, and the Oneidas.] had heard with some disquietude
of the body of trained soldiers sent by the French king to check their incursions and crush
their confederacy. At the beginning of December 1665, the Marquis de Tracy received an embassy
from the Onondagas. They desired to enter into a peace negotiation, and one of the most noted
chiefs, Garakonthie, delivered on that occasion a long and eloquent address to the viceroy.
A treaty was signed by them on behalf of their own and two of the other tribes, the Senecas
and the Oneidas. But meanwhile the Oneidas did not cease from hostilities, and the Mohawks
also continued their bloody raids against the French settlements. Courcelle therefore decided
to march at once against their villages beyond Lake Champlain, in what is now New York state
and to teach them a lesson. But he did not know the nature of a winter expedition in this northern
climate. Leaving Quebec on January 9, he reached Three Rivers on the 16th, and proceeded to
Fort Saint-Louis on the Richelieu, where he had fixed the rendezvous of the troops. The cold
was very severe, and many soldiers were frozen at the outset. On January 29 the little band,
five or six hundred French and Canadians, left Fort Saint-Louis, unfortunately without waiting
for a party of Algonquins who should have acted as scouts. It was a distressing march. The
soldiers had to walk through deep snow, and the unfamiliar use of snowshoes was a great trial
to the Europeans. At night, no shelter! They had to sleep in the open air, under the canopy
of the sky and the cold light of the glimmering stars. Having no guides, Courcelle and his
men lost their way in that unknown country. After seventeen days of extreme toil they found
that, instead of reaching the Mohawk district, they were near Corlaer in the New Netherlands,
sixty miles distant. The vanguard had a brush with two hundred Iroquois, who slipped away after
killing six French soldiers and leaving four of their own number dead. The governor could go
no farther with his exhausted troops and was forced to retrace his steps. The retreat was worse
than the forward march. The supply of provisions failed, and to the suffering from cold was
soon added hunger. Many soldiers died of exposure and starvation. In reading the account of
the ill-fated expedition, one is reminded of the disastrous retreat of Napoleon's army in 1812
through the icy solitudes of Russia. By this sad experience the military commanders of New
France found that they had something to learn of the art of making war in North America, and
must respect the peculiarities of the climate and country. Nevertheless Courcelle's winter
expedition had made an impression on the minds of the Iroquois and had even surprised the Dutch
and the English. The author of a narrative entitled Relation of the March of the Governor of
Canada into New York wrote: 'Surely so bold and hardy an attempt hath not happened in any age.'

Apparently the Five Nations were somewhat uneasy, for in March the Senecas sent ambassadors
to the Marquis de Tracy to ratify the treaty signed in December. In July delegates came from
the Oneida tribe; they presented a letter written by the English authorities at Orange which
assured the viceroy that the Mohawks were well disposed and wished for peace. A new treaty
of ratification was accordingly signed. But the lieutenant-general wanted something more complete
and decisive. He demanded of the delegates a general treaty to include the whole of the Five
Nations, and stated that he would allow forty days for all the Iroquois tribes to send their
ambassadors to Quebec. Moreover, he instructed Father Beschefer to go to Orange with some of
the Oneida delegates for the purpose of meeting the ambassadors and escorting them to Quebec.
Unfortunately, a few days after the priest's departure, news came that four Frenchmen on a
hunting expedition had been killed near Fort Sainte-Anne by a party of Mohawks, and that three
others had been taken prisoners. One of the slain was a cousin of Tracy, and one of the captives
his nephew. Father Beschefer was at once recalled and Captain de Sorel was ordered to march
with some two hundred Frenchmen and ninety Indians to strike a blow at the raiders. Sorel lost
no time and had nearly reached the enemy's villages when he met Tracy's nephew and the other
prisoners under escort of an Iroquois chief and three warriors, who were bound for Quebec to
make amends for the treacherous murder recently perpetrated and to sue for peace. Under these
circumstances Captain de Sorel did not think it necessary to proceed farther, and marched his
men home again with the Iroquois and the rescued prisoners. On August 31 a great meeting was
held at Quebec in the Jesuits' garden. The delegates of the Five Nations were present, and
speeches were made enlarging on the desirability of peace. But it soon became apparent that
no peace could be lasting except after a successful expedition against the Mohawks. Tracy,
Courcelle, and Talon held a consultation, and the intendant submitted a well-prepared document
in which he reviewed the reasons for and against a continuance of the war. In Talon's mind
the arguments in favour of it had undoubtedly the greater weight. Tracy and Courcelle concurred
in this opinion. Thirteen hundred men were drafted for an expedition--six hundred regular soldiers,
six hundred Canadians, and a hundred Indians. All was soon ready, and on September 14, the
day of the Exaltation of the Cross, Tracy and Courcelle left Quebec, at the head of their troops.
It was a spectacle that did not fail to impress the Iroquois chiefs detained in Quebec. One
of them, deeply moved, said to the viceroy: 'I see that we are lost, but you will pay dearly
for your victory; my nation will be exterminated, but I tell you that many of your young men
will not return, for our young warriors will fight desperately. I beg of you to save my wife
and children.' Many who witnessed that martial exit of Tracy and Courcelle from the Chateau
Saint-Louis, surrounded by a staff of noble officers, must have realized that this was a memorable
day in the history of New France. At last a crushing blow was to be struck at the ferocious
foe who for twenty-five years had been the curse and terror of the wretched colony. What mighty
cheers were shouted on that day by the eager and enthusiastic spectators who lined the streets
of Quebec!

On September 28, the troops taking part in the expedition were assembled at Fort Sainte-Anne.
[Footnote: On isle La Mothe at the northern end of Lake Champlain.] Charles Le Moyne commanded
the Montreal contingent, one hundred and ten strong; the Quebec contingent marched under Le
Gardeur de Repentigny. Father Albanel and Father Raffeix, Jesuit priests, the Abbe Dollier
de Casson, a Sulpician, and the Abbe Dubois, chaplain of the Carignan regiment, accompanied
the army. Three hundred light boats had been launched for the crossing of Lakes Champlain and
Saint-Sacrement. Courcelle, always impetuous, was the first to leave the fort; he led a vanguard
of four hundred men which included those from Montreal. The main body of the army under Tracy
set out on October 3. Captains Chambly and Berthier were to follow four days later with the
rear-guard.

The journey by water was uneventful; but the portage between the two lakes was hard and trying.
Yet it was nothing compared with the difficulties of the march beyond Lake Saint-Sacrement.
One hundred miles of forest, mountains, rivers, and swamps lay between the troops and the Iroquois
villages. No roads existed, only narrow footpaths interrupted by quagmires, bristling with
stumps, obstructed by the entanglement of fallen trees, or abruptly cut by the foaming waters
of swollen streams. Heavily laden, with arms, provisions, and ammunition strapped on their
backs, French and Canadians slowly proceeded through the great woods, whose autumnal glories
were vanishing fast under the influence of the chill winds of October. Slipping over moist
logs, sinking into unsuspected swamps, climbing painfully over steep rocks, they went forward
with undaunted determination. At night they had to sleep in the open on a bed of damp leaves.
The crossing of rivers was sometimes dangerous. Tracy, who unfortunately had been seized with
an attack of gout, was nearly drowned in one rapid stream. A Swiss soldier had undertaken to
carry him across on his shoulders, but his strength failed, and if a rock had not stood near,
the viceroy's career might have ended there. A Huron came to the rescue and carried the helpless
viceroy to the other side. The sufferings of the army were increased by a scarcity of food.
The troops were famishing. Luckily they came upon some chestnut-trees and stayed their hunger
with the nuts.

At last, on October 15, the scouts reported that the Mohawk settlements were near at hand.
It was late in the day, darkness was setting in, and a storm of wind and rain was raging. But
Tracy decided to push on. They marched all night, and in the morning, emerging from the woods,
saw before them the first of the Mohawk towns or villages. Without allowing a moment's pause,
the viceroy ordered an advance. The roll of the drums seemed to give the troops new strength
and ardour; French, Canadians, and Indians ran forward to the assault. The Mohawks, apprised
of the coming attack, had determined beforehand to make a stand and had sent their women and
children to another village. But, at the sight of the advancing army, whose numbers appeared
to them three times as great as they really were, and at the sound of the drums, like the voice
of demons, they fled panic-stricken. The first village was taken without striking a blow. The
viceroy immediately ordered a march against the second, which was also found abandoned. Evidently
the Iroquois were terrified, for a third village was taken in the same way, without a show
of defence. It was thought that the invaders' task was finished, when an Algonquin squaw, once
a captive of the Iroquois, informed Courcelle that there were two other villages. The soldiers
pushed forward, and the fourth settlement of the ever-vanishing enemy fell undefended into
the hands of the French. The sun was setting; the exertions of the day and of the night before
had been arduous, and it seemed impossible to go farther. But the squaw, seizing a pistol and
grasping Courcelle's hand, said, 'Come on, I will show you the straight path.' And she led
the way to the town and fort of Andaraque, the most important stronghold of the Mohawks. It
was surrounded with a triple palisade twenty feet high and flanked by four bastions. Vessels
of bark full of water were distributed on the platforms behind the palisade ready for use against
fire. The Iroquois might have made a desperate stand there, and such had been their intention.
But their courage failed them at the fearful beating of the drums and the appearance of that
mighty army, and they sought safety in flight.

The victory was now complete, and the army could go to rest after nearly twenty-four hours
of continuous exertion. Next morning the French were astonished at the sight of Andaraque in
the light of the rising sun. instead of a collection of miserable wigwams, they saw a fine
Indian town, with wooden houses, some of them a hundred and twenty feet long and with lodging
for eight or nine families. These houses were well supplied with provisions, tools, and utensils.
An immense quantity of Indian corn and other necessaries was stored in Andaraque-'food enough
to feed Canada for ten years'--and in the surrounding fields a plentiful crop was ready for
harvest. All this was to be destroyed; but first an impressive ceremony had to be performed.
The army was drawn up in battle array. A French officer, Jean-Baptiste Dubois, commander of
the artillery, advanced, sword in hand, to the front, and in the presence of Tracy and Courcelle,
declared that he was directed by M. Jean Talon, king's counsellor and intendant of justice,
police, and finance for New France, to take possession of Andaraque, and of all the country
of the Mohawks, in the name of the king. A cross was solemnly planted alongside a post bearing
the king's coat of arms. Mass was celebrated and the Te Deum sung. Then the work of destruction
began. The palisades, the dwellings, the bastions, the stores of grain and provisions, except
what was needed by the invaders, the standing crops-all were set on fire; and when night fell
the glaring illumination of that tremendous blaze told the savages that at last New France
had asserted her power, and that the soldiers of the great king had come far enough through
forest and over mountain and stream to chastise in their own country the bloodthirsty tribes
who for a quarter of a century had been the terror of the growing settlements on the St Lawrence.

On their return march the troops suffered great hardships. A storm on Lake Champlain upset
two boats and eight men were drowned. Tracy reached Quebec on November 5. The expedition had
lasted seven weeks, during which time he had covered nine hundred miles. The news of his success
had been received with joy. Since the first days of October the whole colony had been praying
for victory. As soon as the destruction of the Iroquois towns was known, prayers were changed
to thanksgiving. The Te Deum was solemnly chanted, and on November 14 a mass was said in the
church of Notre-Dame-de-Quebec, followed by a procession in gratiarum actionem. New France
might well rejoice. A great result had been attained. True it was that the Mohawks, panic-stricken,
had not been met and crushed. in a set encounter. None the less they had had their lesson.
They had learned that distance and natural impediments were no protection against the French.
Their towns were a heap of ashes, their fields were despoiled, their country was ruined. The
fruit of that expedition was to be eighteen years of peace for New France. Eighteen years of
peace after twenty-five years of murderous incursions! Was not that worth a Te Deum?

After his return Tracy ordered one of the Iroquois detained at Quebec to be hanged as a penalty
for his share in the murder of the French hunters. He then directed three other prisoners,
the Flemish Batard [Footnote: A half-breed Mohawk leader.] and two Oneida chiefs, to go and
inform their respective tribes that he would give them four months to send hostages and make
peace; otherwise he would lead against them another expedition more calamitous for their country
than the first one. At length, in the month of July of the following year, ambassadors of the
Iroquois nations arrived at Quebec with a number of Iroquois families who were to remain as
hostages in the colony. The chiefs asked that missionaries be sent to reside among their tribes.
This petition was granted. New France could now breathe freely. The hatchet was buried.

CHAPTER IV

A COLONIAL COLBERT

Tracy had led a successful expedition against the Iroquois and coerced them into a lasting
peace. He had seen order and harmony restored in the government of the colony. His mission
was over and he left Canada on August 28, 1667, Courcelle remaining as governor and Talon as
intendant. From that moment the latter, though second in rank, became really the first official
of New France, if we consider his work in its relation to the future welfare of the colony.

We have already seen something of his views for the administration of New France. He would
have it emancipated from the jurisdiction of the West India Company; he tried also to impress
on the king and his minister the advisability of augmenting the population in order to develop
the resources of the colony--in a word, he sought to lay the foundations of a flourishing state.
Undoubtedly Colbert wished to help and strengthen New France, but he seemed to think that Talon's
aim was too ambitious. In one of his letters the intendant had gone the length of submitting
a plan f or the acquisition of New Netherlands, which had been conquered by the English in
1664. He suggested that, in the negotiations for peace between France, England, and Holland,
Louis XIV might stipulate for the restoration to Holland of its colony, and in the meantime
come to an understanding with the States-General for its cession to France. Annexation to Canada
would follow. But Colbert thought that Talon was too bold. The intendant had spoken of New
France as likely to become a great kingdom. In answer, the minister said that the king saw
many obstacles to the fulfilment of these expectations. To create on the shores of the St Lawrence
an important state would require much emigration from France, and it would not be wise to draw
so many people from the kingdom--to 'unpeople France for the purpose of peopling Canada.' Moreover
if too many colonists came to Canada in one season, the area already under cultivation would
not produce enough to feed the increased population, and great hardship would follow. Evidently
Colbert did not here display his usual insight. Talon never had in mind the unpeopling of France.
He meant simply that if the home government would undertake to send out a few hundred settlers
every year, the result would be the creation of a strong and prosperous nation on the shores
of the St Lawrence. The addition of five hundred immigrants annually during the whole period
of Louis XIV's reign would have given Canada in 1700 a population of five hundred thousand.
It was thought that the mother country could not spare so many; and yet the cost in men to
France of a single battle, the bloody victory of Senef in 1674, was eight thousand French soldiers.
The wars of Louis XIV killed ten times more men than the systematic colonization of Canada
would have taken from the mother country. The second objection raised by Colbert was no better
founded than the first. Talon did not ask for the immigration of more colonists than the country
could feed. But he rightly thought that with peace assured the colony could produce food enough
for a very numerous population, and that increase in production would speedily follow increase
in numbers.

It must not be supposed that Colbert was indifferent to the development of New France. No other
minister of the French king did more for Canada. It was under his administration that the strength
which enabled the colony so long to survive its subsequent trials was acquired. But Colbert
was entangled in the intricacies of European politics. Obliged to co-operate in ventures which
in his heart he condemned, and which disturbed him in his work of financial and administrative
reform, he yielded sometimes to the fear of weakening the trunk of the old tree by encouraging
the growth of the young shoots.

Talon had to give in. But he did so in such a way as to gain his point in part. He wrote that
he would speak no more of the great establishment he had thought possible, since the minister
was of opinion that France had no excess of population which could be used for the peopling
of Canada. At the same time he insisted on the necessity of helping the colony, and assured
Colbert that, could he himself see Canada, he would be disposed to do his utmost for it, knowing
that a new country cannot make its own way without being helped effectively at the outset.
Talon's tact and firmness of purpose had their reward, for the next year Colbert gave ample
proof that he understood Canada's situation and requirements.

On the question of the West India Company also there was some divergence of view between the
minister and the intendant. As we have seen in a preceding chapter, Talon had expressed his
apprehension of the evils likely to spring from the wide privileges exercised by the company.
But this trading association was Colbert's creation. He had contended that the failure of the
One Hundred Associates was due to inherent weakness. The new one was stronger and could do
better. Perhaps difficulties might arise in the beginning on account of the inexperience and
greed of some of the company's agents, but with time the situation would improve. It was not
surprising that Colbert should defend the company he had organized. Nevertheless, on that point
as on the other, Colbert contrived to meet Talon half-way. The Indian trade, he said, would
be opened to the colonists, and for one year the company would grant freedom of trade generally
to all the people of New France.

In connection with the rights of this company another question, affecting the finances, was
soon to arise. By its charter the company was entitled to collect the revenues of the colony;
that is to say, the taxes levied on the sale of beaver and moose skins. The tax on beaver skins
was twenty-five per cent, called le droit du quart; the tax on moose skins was two sous per
pound, le droit du dixieme. There was also the revenue obtained from the sale or farming out
of the trading privileges at Tadoussac, la traite de Tadoussac. All these formed what was called
le fonds du pays, the public fund, out of which were paid the emoluments of the governor and
the public officers, the costs of the garrisons at Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers, the
grants to religious communities, and other permanent yearly disbursements. The company had
the right to collect the taxes, but was obliged to pay the public charges.

Writing to Colbert, Talon said he would have been greatly pleased if, in addition to these
rights, the king had retained the fiscal powers of the crown. He declared that the taxes were
productive, yet the company's agent seemed very reluctant to pay the public charges. Colbert,
of course, decided that the company, in accordance with its charter, was entitled to enjoy
the fiscal rights upon condition of defraying annually the ordinary public expenditure of the
country, as the company which preceded it had done. Immediately another point was raised. What
should be the amount of the public expenditure, or rather, to what figure should the company
be allowed to reduce it? Talon maintained that the public charges defrayed by the former company
amounted to 48,950 livres. [Footnote: The livre was equivalent to the later franc, about twenty
cents of modern Canadian currency.] The company's agent contended that they amounted only to
29,200 livres and that the sum of 48,950 livres was exorbitant, as it exceeded by 4000 livres
the highest sum ever received from farming out the revenue. [Footnote: It was the custom in
New France to sell or farm out the revenues. Instead of collecting direct the fur taxes and
the proceeds of the Tadoussac trade, the government granted the rights to a corporation or
a private individual in return for a fixed sum annually.] To this the intendant replied by
submitting evidence that the rights were farmed out for 50,000 livres in 1660 and in 1663;
moreover, the rights were more valuable now, for with the conclusion of peace trade would prosper.
In the end Colbert decided that the sum payable by the company should be 36,000 livres annually.
The ordinary revenue of New France was thus fixed, and remained at that sum for many years.

It must not be supposed that this revenue was sufficient to meet all the expenses connected
with the defence and development of the colony. There was an extraordinary fund provided by
the king's treasury and devoted to the movement and maintenance of the troops, the payment
of certain special emoluments, the transport of new settlers, horses, and sheep, the construction
of forts, the purchase and shipment of supplies. In 1665 this extraordinary budget amounted
to 358,000 livres.

Talon's energetic action on the question of the revenue was inspired by his knowledge of the
public needs. He knew that many things requiring money had to be done. A new country like Canada
could not be opened up for settlement without expense, and he thought that the traders who
reaped the benefit of their monopoly should pay their due share of the outlay.

We have already seen that Talon had begun the establishment of three villages in the vicinity
of Quebec. Let us briefly enumerate the principles which guided him in erecting these settlements.
First of all, in deference to the king's instructions relative to concentration, he contrived
to plant the new villages as near as possible to the capital, and evolved a plan which would
group the settlers about a central point and thus provide for their mutual help and defence.
In pursuance of this plan he made all his Charlesbourg land grants triangular, narrow at the
head, wide at the base, so that the houses erected at the head were near each other and formed
a square in the centre of the settlement. In this arrangement there was originality and good
sense. After more than two centuries, Talon's idea remains stamped on the soil; and the plans
of the Charlesbourg villages as surveyed in our own days show distinctly the form of settlement
adopted by the intendant.

Proper dwellings were made ready to receive the new-comers. Then Talon proceeded with the establishment
of settlers. To his great joy some soldiers applied for grants. He made point of having skilled
workmen, some, if possible, in each village--carpenters, shoemakers, masons, or other artisans,
whose services would be useful to all. He tried also to induce habitants of earlier date to
join the new settlements, where their experience would be a guide and their methods an object-lesson
to beginners.

The grants were made on very generous terms, The soldiers and habitants, on taking possession
of their land, received a substantial supply of food and the tools necessary for their work.
They were to be paid for clearing and tilling the first two acres. In return each was bound
by his deed to clear and prepare for cultivation during the three or four following years another
two acres, which could afterwards be allotted to an incoming settler. Talon proposed also that
they should be bound to military service. For each new-comer the king assumed the total expense
of clearing two acres, erecting a house, preparing and sowing the ground, and providing flour
until a crop was reaped--all on condition that the occupant should clear and cultivate two
additional acres within three or four years, presumably for allotment to the next new-comer.

Such were the broad lines of Talon's colonization policy. But to his mind it was not enough
that he should make regulations and issue orders; he would set up a model farm himself and
thus be an example in his own person. He bought land in the neighbourhood of the St Charles
river and had the ground cleared at his own expense. He erected thereon a large house, a barn,
and other buildings; and, in course of time, his fine property, comprising cultivated fields,
meadows, and gardens, and well stocked with domestic animals, became a source of pride to him.

Under Talon's wise direction and encouragement, the settlement of the country progressed rapidly.
Now that they could work in safety, the colonists set themselves to the task of clearing new
farms. In his Relation of 1668 Father Le Mercier wrote: 'It is fine to see new settlements
on each side of the St Lawrence for a distance of eighty leagues... The fear of aggression
no longer prevents our farmers from encroaching on the forest and harvesting all kinds of grain,
which the soil here grows as well as in France.' In the district of Montreal there was great
activity. It was during this period that the lands of Longue-Pointe, of Pointe-aux-Trembles,
and of Lachine were first cultivated. At the same time, along the river Richelieu, in the vicinity
of Forts Chambly and Sorel, officers and soldiers of the Carignan-Salieres regiment were beginning
to settle. 'These worthy gentlemen,' wrote Mother Marie de l'Incarnation, 'are at work, with
the king's permission, establishing new French colonies. They live on their farm produce, for
they have oxen, cows, and poultry.' A census taken in 1668 gave very satisfactory figures.
A year before there had been 11,448 acres under cultivation. That year there were 15,649, and
wheat production amounted to 130,979 bushels. Such results were encouraging. What a change
in three years!

One of the commodities most needed in the colony was hemp, for making coarse cloth. Talon accordingly
caused several acres to be sown with hemp. The seed was gathered and distributed among a number
of farmers, on the understanding that they would bring back an equal quantity of seed next
year. Then he took a very energetic step. He seized all the thread in the shops and gave notice
that nobody could procure thread except in exchange for hemp. In a word, he created a monopoly
of thread to promote the production of hemp; and the policy was successful. In many other ways
the intendant's activity and zeal for the public good manifested themselves. He favoured the
development of the St Lawrence fisheries and encouraged some of the colonists to devote their
labour to them. Cod-fishing was attempted with good results. Shipbuilding was another industry
of his introduction. In 1666, always desirous of setting an example, he built a small craft
of one hundred and twenty tons. Later, he had the gratification of informing Colbert that a
Canadian merchant was building a vessel for the purpose of fishing in the lower St Lawrence.
During the following year six or seven ships were built at Quebec. The Relation of 1667 states
that Talon 'took pains to find wood fit for shipbuilding, which has been begun by the construction
of a barge found very useful and of a big ship ready to float.'

In building and causing ships to be built the intendant had in view the extension of the colony's
trade. One of his schemes was to establish regular commercial intercourse between Canada, the
West Indies, and France. The ships of La Rochelle, Dieppe, and Havre, after unloading at Quebec,
would carry Canadian products to the French West Indies, where they would load cargoes of sugar
for France. The intendant, always ready to show the way, entered into partnership with a merchant
and shipped to the West Indies salmon, eels, salt and dried cod, peas, staves, fish-oil, planks,
and small masts much needed in the islands. The establishment of commercial relations between
Canada and the West Indies was an event of no small moment. During the following years this
trade proved important. In 1670 three ships built at Quebec were sent to the islands with cargoes
of fish, oil, peas, planks, barley, and flour. In 1672 two ships made the same voyage; and
in 1681 Talon's successor, the intendant Duchesneau, wrote to the minister that every year
since his arrival two vessels at least (in one year four) had left Quebec for the West Indies
with Canadian products.

The intendant was a busy man. The scope of his activity included the discovery and development
of mines. There had been reports of finding lead at Gaspe, and the West India Company had made
an unsuccessful search there. At Baie Saint-Paul below Quebec iron ore was discovered, and
it was thought that copper and silver also would be found at the same place. In 1667 Father
Allouez returned from the upper Ottawa, bringing fragments of copper which he had detached
from stones on the shores of Lake Huron. Engineers sent by the intendant reported favourably
of the coal-mines in Cape Breton; the specimens tested were deemed to be of very good quality.
In this connection may be mentioned a mysterious allusion in Talon's correspondence to the
existence of coal where none is now to be found. In 1667 he wrote to Colbert that a coal-mine
had been discovered at the foot of the Quebec rock. 'This coal,' he said, 'is good enough for
the forge. If the test is satisfactory, I shall see that our vessels take loads of it to serve
as ballast. It would be a great help in our naval construction; we could then do without the
English coal.' Next year the intendant wrote again: 'The coal-mine opened at Quebec, which
originated in the cellar of a lower-town resident and is continued through the cape under the
Chateau Saint-Louis, could not be worked, I fear, without imperilling the stability of the
chateau. However, I shall try to follow another direction; for, notwithstanding the excellent
mine at Cape Breton, it would be a capital thing for the ships landing at Quebec to find coal
here.' Is there actually a coal-mine at Quebec hidden in the depth of the rock which bears
now on its summit Dufferin Terrace and the Chateau Frontenac? We have before us Talon's official
report. He asserts positively that coal was found there--coal which was tested, which burned
well in the forge. What has become of the mine, and where is that coal? Nobody at the present
day has ever heard of a coal-mine at Quebec, and the story seems incredible. But Talon's letter
is explicit. No satisfactory explanation has yet been suggested, and we confess inability to
offer one here.

While reviewing the great intendant's activities, we must not fail to mention the brewing industry
in which he took the lead. In 1668 he erected a brewery near the river St Charles, on the spot
at the foot of the hill where stood in later years the intendant's palace. He meant in this
way to help the grain-growers by taking part of their surplus product, and also to do something
to check the increasing importation of spirits which caused so much trouble and disorder. However
questionable the efficacy of beer in promoting temperance, Talon's object is worthy of applause.
Three years later the intendant wrote that his brewery was capable of turning out two thousand
hogsheads of beer for exportation to the West Indies and two thousand more for home consumption.
To do this it would require over twelve thousand bushels of grain annually, and would be a
great support to the farmers. In the mean-time he had planted hops on his farm and was raising
good crops.

Talon's buoyant reports and his incessant entreaties for a strong and active colonial policy
could not fail to enlist the sympathy of two such statesmen as Louis XIV and Colbert. This
is perhaps the only period in earlier Canadian history during which the home government steadily
followed a wise and energetic policy of developing and strengthening the colony. We have seen
that Colbert hesitated at first to encourage emigration, but he had yielded somewhat before
Talon's urgent representations, and from 1665 to 1671 there was an uninterrupted influx of
Canadian settlers. It is recorded in a document written by Talon himself that in 1665 the West
India Company brought to Canada for the king's account 429 men and 100 young women, and 184
men and 92 women in 1667. During these seven years there were in all 1828 state-aided immigrants
to Canada. The young women were carefully selected, and it was the king's wish that they should
marry promptly, in order that the greatest possible number of new families should be founded.
As a matter of fact, the event was in accordance with the king's wish. In 1665 Mother Marie
de l'Incarnation wrote that the hundred girls arrived that year were nearly all provided with
husbands. In 1667 she wrote again: 'This pear ninety-two girls came from France and they are
already married to soldiers and labourers.' In 1670 one hundred and fifty girls arrived, and
Talon wrote on November 10: 'All the girls who came this year are married, except fifteen whom
I have placed in well-known families to await the time when the soldiers who sought them for
their wives are established and able to maintain them.' It was indeed a matrimonial period,
and it is not surprising that marriage was the order of the day. Every incentive to that end
was brought to bear. The intendant gave fifty livres in household supplies and some provisions
to each young woman who contracted marriage. According to the king's decree, each youth who
married at or before the age of twenty was entitled to a gift of twenty livres, called 'the
king's gift.' The same decree imposed a penalty upon all fathers who had not married their
sons at twenty and their daughters at sixteen. In the same spirit, it enacted also that all
Canadians having ten children living should be entitled to a pension of three hundred livres
annually; four hundred livres was the reward for twelve. 'Marry early' was the royal mandate.
Colbert, writing to Talon in 1668, says: 'I pray you to commend it to the consideration of
the whole people, that their prosperity, their subsistence, and all that is dear to them, depend
on a general resolution, never to be departed from, to marry youths at eighteen or nineteen
years and girls at fourteen or fifteen; since abundance can never come to them except through
the abundance of men.' And this was not enough; Colbert went on: 'Those who may seem to have
absolutely renounced marriage should be made to bear additional burdens, and be excluded from
all honours; it would be well even to add some mark of infamy.' The unfortunate bachelor seems
to have been treated somewhat as a public malefactor. Talon issued an order forbidding unmarried
volontaires to hunt with the Indians or go into the woods, if they did not marry fifteen days
after the arrival of the ships from France. And a case is recorded of one Francois Lenoir,
of Montreal, who was brought before the judge because, being unmarried, he had gone to trade
with the Indians. He pleaded guilty, and pledged himself to marry next year after the arrival
of the ships, or failing that, to give one hundred and fifty livres to the church of Montreal
and a like sum to the hospital. He kept his money and married within the term.

The matrimonial zeal of Colbert and Talon did not slight the noblemen and officers. Captain
de la Mothe, marrying and taking up his abode in the country, received sixteen hundred livres.
During the years 1665-68 six thousand livres were expended to aid the marriage of young gentlewomen
without means, and six thousand to enable four captains, three lieutenants, five ensigns, and
a few minor officers to settle and marry in the colony.

A word must be said as to the character of the young women. Some writers have cast unfair aspersions
upon the girls sent out from France to marry in Canada. After a serious study of the question,
we are in a position to state that these girls were most carefully selected. Some of them were
orphans reared in charitable institutions under the king's protection; they were called les
filles du roi. The rest belonged to honest families, and their parents, overburdened with children,
were willing to send them to a new country where they would be well provided for. In 1670 Colbert
wrote to the archbishop of Rouen: 'As in the parishes about Rouen fifty or sixty girls might
be found who would be very glad to go to Canada to be married, I beg you to employ your credit
and authority with the cures of thirty or forty of these parishes, to try to find in each of
them one or two girls disposed to go voluntarily for the sake of settlement in life.' Such
was the quality of the female emigration to Canada. The girls were drawn from reputable institutions,
or from good peasant families, under the auspices of the cures. During their journey to Canada
they were under the care and direction of persons highly respected for their virtues and piety,
such as Madame Bourdon, widow of the late attorney-general of New France, or Mademoiselle Etienne,
who was appointed governess of the girls leaving for Canada by the directors of the general
hospital of Paris. When young women arrived in Canada, they were either immediately married
or placed for a time in good families.

The paternal policy of the minister and the intendant was favoured by the disbanding of the
Carignan companies. In 1668 the regiment was recalled to France; four companies only were left
in Canada to garrison the forts. The officers and soldiers of the companies withdrawn were
entreated to remain as settlers, and about four hundred decided to make their home in Canada.
They were generously subsidized. Each soldier electing to settle in the colony received one
hundred livres, or fifty livres with provisions for one year, at his choice. Each sergeant
received one hundred and fifty livres, or one hundred livres with one year's provisions. The
officers also were given liberal endowments. Among them were: Captains de Contrecoeur, de Saint-Ours,
de Sorel, Dugue de Boisbriant, Lieutenants Gaultier de Varennes and Margane de la Valtrie;
Ensigns Paul Dupuis, Becard de Grandville, Pierre Monet de Moras, Francois Jarret de Vercheres.

The strenuous efforts of Colbert and Talon could not but give a great impulse to population.
The increase was noticeable. In November 1671 Talon wrote:

   His Majesty will see by the extracts of the registers
   of baptisms that the number of children this year is
   six or seven hundred; and in the coming years we may
   hope for a substantial increase. There is some reason
   to believe that, without any further female immigration,
   the country will see more than one hundred marriages
   next year. I consider it unnecessary to send girls
   next year; the better to give the habitants a chance
   to marry their own girls to soldiers desirous of
   settling. Neither will it be necessary to send young
   ladies, as we received last year fifteen, instead of
   the four who were needed for wives of officers and
   notables.

In a former chapter the population of Canada in 1665 was given as 3215 souls, and the number
of families 533. In 1668 the number of families was 1139 and the population 6282. In three
years the population had nearly doubled and the number of families had more than doubled.

Other statistics may fittingly be given here. During the period under consideration, the West
India Company sent to Canada for the king's account many horses and sheep. These were badly
needed in the colony. Since its first settlement there had been seen in New France only a single
horse, one which had been presented by the Company of One Hundred Associates to M. de Montmagny,
the governor who succeeded Champlain. But from 1665 to 1668 forty-one mares and stallions and
eighty sheep were brought from France. Domestic animals continued to be introduced until 1672.
Fourteen horses and fifty sheep were sent in 1669, thirteen horses in 1670, the same number
of horses and a few asses in 1671. So that during these seven years Canada received from France
about eighty horses. Twenty years afterwards, in 1692, there were four hundred horses in the
colony. In 1698 there were six hundred and eighty-four; and in 1709 the number had so increased
that the intendant Raudot issued an ordinance to restrain the multiplication of these animals.

From what has been said it will be seen that this period of Canadian history was one of great
progress. What Colbert was to France Talon was to New France. While the great minister, in
the full light of European publicity, was gaining fame as a financial reformer and the reviver
of trade and industry, the sagacious and painstaking intendant in his remote corner of the
globe was laying the foundations of an economic and political system, and opening to the young
country the road of commercial, industrial, and maritime progress. Talon was a colonial Colbert.
What the latter did in a wide sphere and with ample means, the former was trying to do on a
small scale and with limited resources. Both have deserved a place of honour in Canadian annals.

CHAPTER V

THE INTENDANT AND THE SOVEREIGN COUNCIL

In the preceding chapter a sketch has been given of Talon's endeavours to promote colonization,
agriculture, shipbuilding, and commerce, to increase the population, and to foster generally
the prosperity of New France. Let us now see how he provided for the good administration and
internal order of the colony.

In 1666 he had prepared and submitted to Tracy and Courcelle a series of rules and enactments
relating to various important matters, one of which was the administration of justice. Talon
wished to simplify the procedure; to make justice speedy, accessible to all, and inexpensive.
In each parish he proposed to establish judges having the power to hear and decide in the first
instance all civil cases involving not more than ten livres. In addition, there would be four
judges at Quebec, and appeals might be taken before three of them from all decisions given
by the local judges--'unless,' Talon added, 'it be thought more advisable to maintain the Sieur
Chartier in his charge of lieutenant-general, to which he has been appointed by the West India
Company.' It was decided that M. Chartier (de Lotbiniere) should be so maintained, and he was
duly confirmed as lieutenant civil et criminel on January 10, 1667. He had jurisdiction in
the first instance over all cases civil and criminal in the Quebec district and in appeal from
the judgments of the local or seigneurial judges. The Sovereign Council acted as a court of
appeal in the last resort, except in cases where the parties made a supreme appeal to the King's
Council of State in France. In 1669 Talon wrote a memorandum in which we find these words:
'Justice is administered in the first instance by judges in the seigneuries; then by a lieutenant
civil and criminal appointed by the company in each of the jurisdictions of Quebec and Three
Rivers; and above all by the Sovereign Council, which in the last instance decides all cases
where an appeal lies.' At Montreal there was a lieutenant civil and criminal appointed by the
Sulpicians, seigneurs of the island. In 1667 there were seigneurial judges in the seigneuries
of Beaupre, Beauport, Notre-Dame-des-Anges, Cap-de-la-Magdeleine.

It is interesting to find that Talon attempted to establish a method of settlement out of court,
the principle of which was accepted by the legislature of the province of Quebec more than
two centuries later. What was called the amiable composition of the French intendant may be
regarded as a first edition of the law passed at Quebec in 1899, which provides for conciliation
or arbitration proceedings before a lawsuit is begun. [Footnote: 62 Vict. cap. 54, p. 271.]
Talon also introduced an equitable system of land registration.

In the proceedings of the Sovereign Council, of which Talon at this time was the inspiring
mind, we may see reflected the condition and internal life of the colony. Decrees for the regulation
of trade were frequent. Commercial freedom was unknown. Under the administration of the governor
Avaugour (1661-63) a tariff of prices had been published, which the merchants were compelled
to observe. Again, in 1664 the council had decided that the merchants might charge fifty-five
per cent above cost price on dry goods, one hundred per cent on the more expensive wines and
spirits, and one hundred and twenty per cent on the cheaper, the cost price in France being
determined by the invoice-bills. In 1666 a new tariff was enacted by the council, in which
the price of one hogshead of Bordeaux wine was fixed at eighty livres, and that of Brazil tobacco
at forty sous a pound. In 1667 again changes took place: on dry goods the merchants were allowed
seventy per cent above cost; on spirits and wines, one hundred or one hundred and twenty per
cent as in 1664. The merchants did not accept these rulings without protest. In 1664 the most
important Quebec trader, Charles Aubert de la Chesnaye, was prosecuted for contravention, and
made this bold declaration in favour of commercial freedom: 'I have always deemed that I had
a right to the free disposal of my own, especially when I consider that I spend in the colony
what I earn therein.' Prosecutions for violating the law were frequent. During the month of
June 1667, at a sitting of the Sovereign Council, Tracy, Courcelle, Talon, and Laval being
present, the attorney- general Bourdon made out a case against Jacques de la Mothe, a merchant,
for having sold wines and tobacco at higher prices than those of the tariff. The defendant
acknowledged that he had sold his wine at one hundred livres and his tobacco at sixty sous,
but alleged that his wine was the best Bordeaux, that his hogsheads had a capacity of fully
one hundred and twenty pots, that care, risk, and leakage should be taken into consideration,
that two hogsheads had been spoiled, and that the price of those remaining should be higher
to compensate him for their loss. As to the tobacco, it was of the Maragnan quality, and he
had always deemed it impossible to sell it for less than sixty sous. After hearing the case,
the council decided that two of its members, Messieurs Damours and de la Tesserie, should make
an inspection at La Mothe's store, in order to taste his wine and tobacco and gauge his hogsheads.
Away they went; and afterwards they made their report. Finally La Mothe was condemned to a
fine of twenty-two livres, payable to the Hotel-Dieu. It may be remarked here that very often
the fines had a similar destination; in that way justice helped charity.

The magistrates were vigilant, but the merchants were cunning and often succeeded in evading
the tariff. In July 1667, the habitants' syndic appeared before the council to complain of
the various devices resorted to by merchants to extort higher prices from the settlers than
were allowed by law. So the council made a ruling that all merchandise should be stamped, in
the presence of the syndic, according to the prices of each kind and quality, and ordered samples
duly stamped in this way to be delivered to commissioners specially appointed for the purpose.
It will be seen that these regulations were minute and severe. Trade was thus submitted to
stern restrictions which would seem strange and unbearable in these days of freedom. What an
outcry there would be if parliament should attempt now to dictate to our merchants the selling
price of their merchandise! But in the seventeenth century such a thing was common enough.
It was a time of extreme official interference in private affairs and transactions.

We have mentioned the syndic of the inhabitants--syndic des habitants. A word about this officer
will be in place here. He was the spokesman of the community when complaints had to be made
or petitions presented to the governor or the Sovereign Council. At that time in Canada there
was no municipal government. True, an unlucky experiment had been made in 1663, under the governor
Mezy, when a mayor and two aldermen were elected at Quebec. But their enjoyment of office was
of brief duration; in a few weeks the election was declared void, It was then determined to
nominate a syndic to represent the inhabitants, and on August 3 Claude Charron, a merchant,
was elected to the office; but, as the habitants often had difficulties to settle with members
of the commercial class, objection was taken to him on the ground that he was a tradesman,
and he retired. On September 17 a new election took place, and Jean Le Mire, a carpenter, was
elected. Later on, during the troubles of the Mezy regime, the office seems to have been practically
abolished; but when the government was reorganized, it was thought advisable to revive it.
The council decreed another election, and on March 20, 1667, Jean Le Mire was again chosen
as syndic. Le Mire continued to hold the office for many years.

To the colony of that day the Sovereign Council was, broadly speaking, what the legislatures,
the executives, the courts of justice, and the various commissions--all combined--are to modern
Canada. But, as we have seen, it had arbitrary powers that these modern bodies are not permitted
to exercise. Its long arm reached into every concern of the inhabitants. In 1667, for example,
the habitants asked for a regulation to fix the millers' fee--the amount of the toll to which
they would be entitled for grinding the grain. The owners of the flour-mills represented that
the construction, repair, and maintenance of their mills were two or three times more costly
in Canada than in France, and that they should have a proportionate fee; still, they would
be willing to accept the bare remuneration usually allowed in the kingdom. The toll was fixed
at one-fourteenth of the grain. Highways were also under the care of the council. When the
residents of a locality presented a petition for opening a road, the council named two of its
members to make an inspection and report. On receipt of the report, an order would be issued
for opening a road along certain lines and of a specified width (it was often eighteen feet),
and for pulling stumps and filling up hollows. There was an official called the grand-voyer,
or general overseer of roads. The office had been established in 1657, when Rene Robineau de
Becancourt was appointed grand-voyer by the Company of One Hundred Associates. But in the wretched
state of the colony at that time M. de Becancourt had not much work to do. In later years,
however, the usefulness of a grand-voyer had become more apparent, and Becancourt asked for
a confirmation of his appointment. On the suggestion of Talon, the council reinstated him and
ordered that his commission be registered. During the whole French regime there were but five
general overseers of roads or grands-voyers: Rene Robineau de Becancourt (1657-99); Pierre
Robineau de Becancourt (1699-1729); E. Lanoullier de Boisclerc (1731-51); M. de la Gorgendiere
(1751-59); M. de Lino (1759-60).

Guardianship of public morality and the maintenance of public order were the chief cares of
the council. It was ever intent on the suppression of vice. On August 20, 1667, in the presence
of Tracy, Courcelle, Talon, and Laval, the attorney-general submitted information of scandalous
conduct on the part of some women and girls, and represented that a severe punishment would
be a wholesome warning to all evil-doers; he also suggested that the wife of Sebastien Langelier,
being one of the most disorderly, should be singled out for an exemplary penalty. A councillor
was immediately appointed to investigate the case. What was done in this particular instance
is not recorded, but there is evidence to show that licentious conduct was often severely dealt
with. Crimes and misdemeanours were ruthlessly pursued. For a theft committed at night in the
Hotel-Dieu garden, the intendant condemned a man to be marked with the fleur-de-lis, to be
exposed for four hours in the pillory, and to serve three years in the galleys. Another culprit
convicted of larceny was sentenced to be publicly whipped and to serve three years in the galleys.
Both these prisoners escaped and returned to their former practices. They were recaptured and
sentenced, the first to be hanged, the second to be whipped, marked with the fleur-de-lis,
and kept in irons until further order. Rape in the colony was unhappily frequent. A man convicted
of this crime was condemned to death and executed two days later. Another was whipped till
the blood flowed and condemned to serve nine years in the galleys.

Let us now turn to activities of another order. One of the most important ordinances enacted
by the Sovereign Council under Talon's direction was that which concerned the importation of
spirits and the establishment in the colony of the brewing industry. It was stated in this
decree that the great quantity of brandies and wines imported from France was a cause of debauchery.
Many were diverted from productive work, their health was ruined, they were induced to squander
their money, and prevented from buying necessaries and supplies useful for the development
of the colony. Talon, as we have read in another chapter, thought that one of the best means
of combating the immoderate use of spirits was the setting up of breweries; at the same time
he intended that this industry should help agriculture. The Sovereign Council entered into
these views and enacted that as soon as breweries should be in operation in Canada all importation
of wines and spirits should be prohibited, except by special permission and subject to a tax
of five hundred livres, payable one-third to the seigneurs of the country, one-third to the
Hotel-Dieu, and one-third to the person who had set up the first brewery after the date of
the enactment. Under no circumstances should the yearly importation exceed eight hundred hogsheads
of wine and four hundred of brandy. When this amount had been reached, no further licences
to import would be issued. The council begged Talon to take the necessary steps for the construction
and equipment of one or more breweries. The owners of these were to have, during ten years,
the exclusive privilege of brewing for trading purposes. The price of beer was fixed beforehand
at twenty livres per hogshead and six sous per pot so long as barley was priced at three livres
per bushel or less; if the price of barley went higher, the price of beer should be raised
proportionately.

In 1667 the Sovereign Council--inspired by Talon--had to discuss a very important question.
This was the formation of a company of Canadians to secure the exclusive privilege of trading.
By its charter, the West India Company had been granted the commercial monopoly. Under pressure
from Talon it had somewhat abated its pretensions and had allowed freedom of trade for a time.
But again it was urging its rights. The council asked the intendant to support with his influence
at court the plan for a Canadian company, which he did. Colbert did not say no; neither did
he seem in a hurry to grant the request. In 1668 the council sent the minister a letter praying
for freedom of trade. This year the company had enforced its monopoly and the people had suffered
from the lack of necessaries, which could not be found in the company's stores; moreover, prices
were exceedingly high. Such a state of things was detrimental to the colony. The council begged
that, if Colbert were not disposed to grant freedom of trade, he would favourably consider
the scheme for a trading company composed of Canadians, which had been submitted to him the
year before. We shall see, later on, what came of this agitation against the West India Company.

The good understanding between the intendant and the Sovereign Council was absolute. The council
had shown unequivocal confidence in Talon's ability and respect for his person and authority.
A few days before the Marquis de Tracy had left the colony the council had ordered that all
petitions to enter lawsuits should be presented to the intendant, who should assign them to
the council or to the lieutenant civil and criminal, or try them himself, at his discretion.
This was treating Talon as the supreme magistrate and acknowledging him as the dispenser of
justice. M. de Courcelle, who was beginning to feel some uneasiness at Talon's great authority
and prestige, refused to sign the proceedings of that day, inscribing these lines in the council's
register: 'This decree being against the governor's authority and the public good, I did not
wish to sign it.' At the beginning of the following year Talon, whose attention perhaps had
not been called to Courcelle's written protest, requested the adoption of a similar decree;
and the council did not hesitate to confirm its previous decision, notwithstanding the governor's
former opposition, which he reiterated in the same terms. Courcelle was certainly mistaken
in supposing that the council's decision was an encroachment on his authority. The superior
jurisdiction in judicial matters belonged to the intendant. Under his commission he had the
right to 'judge alone and with full jurisdiction in civil matters,' to 'hear all cases of crimes
and misdemeanours, abuse and malversation, by whomsoever committed,' to 'proceed against all
persons guilty of any crime, whatever might be their quality or condition, to pursue the proceedings
until final completion, judgment and execution thereof.' Nevertheless, in practice and with
due regard to the good administration of justice, the council's decree went perhaps too far.
The question remained in abeyance and was not settled until four years afterwards, at the end
of Talon's second term in Canada. He had written to Colbert on the subject stating that he
would be glad to be discharged of the judicial responsibility, and to see the question of initiating
lawsuits referred to the Sovereign Council.

   As a matter of fact [he said], receiving the petitions
   for entering lawsuits does not mean retaining them
   before myself. I have not judged twenty cases, civil
   or criminal, since I came here, having always tried
   as much as I could to conciliate the opposing parties.
   The reason why I speak now of this matter is that very
   often, for twenty or thirty livres of principal, a
   plaintiff goes before the judge of first instance--which
   diverts the parties from the proper cultivation of
   their farms--and later on, by way of an appeal, before
   the Sovereign Council which likes to hear and judge
   cases.

Colbert did not deem the decision of the council advisable.

   It is contrary [he wrote] to the order of justice, in
   virtue of which, leaving in their own sphere the
   superior judges, the judges of first instance are
   empowered to hear all cases within their jurisdiction,
   and their judgments can be appealed from to the
   Sovereign Council. Moreover it would be a burden for
   the king's subjects living far from Quebec to go there
   unnecessarily in order to ascertain before what tribunal
   they should be heard.

We must now speak of a most important matter--the brandy traffic. The sale of intoxicating
liquor to the Indians had always been prohibited in the colony. In 1657 a decree of the King's
State Council had ratified and renewed this prohibition under pain of corporal punishment.
Yet, notwithstanding the decree, greedy traders broke the law and, for the purpose of getting
furs at a low price, supplied the Indians with eau-de-feu, or firewater, which made them like
wild beasts. The most frightful disorders were prevalent, the most heinous crimes committed,
and scandalous demoralization followed. In 1660 the evil was so great that Mgr de Laval, exercising
his pastoral functions, decreed excommunication against all those pursuing the brandy traffic
in defiance of ordinances. This might have stopped the progress of the evil had not the governor
Avaugour opened the door to renewed disorder two years later by a most unfortunate policy.
Thereupon Laval crossed the ocean to France, obtained the governor's recall, and succeeded,
though with some difficulty, in maintaining the former prohibition. In 1663 the Sovereign Council
enacted an ordinance strictly forbidding the selling or giving of brandy to Indians directly
or indirectly, for any reason or pretence whatsoever. The penalty for the offence was a fine
of three hundred livres, payable one-third to the informers, one-third to the Hotel-Dieu, and
one-third to the public treasury. And for a second offence the punishment was whipping or banishment.
In 1667, after the Sovereign Council had been finally reorganized, the prohibition was renewed,
on a motion of attorney-general Bourdon, under the same penalties as before, and it devolved
many times upon the council to condemn transgressors of this ordinance to fines, imprisonment,
or corporal punishment. Talon was present and concurred in these condemnations. But gradually
his mind changed. He was becoming daily more impressed with the material benefits of the brandy
traffic and less convinced of its moral danger. He was besides displeased with the bishop's
excommunication. In his view it was an encroachment of the spiritual upon the civil power.
Under the influence of these feelings he came to consider prohibition of the liquor traffic
as a mistake, damaging to the trade and progress of the colony and to French influence over
the Indian tribes. These were the arguments put forward by the supporters of the traffic. According
to them, to refuse brandy to the Indians was to let the English monopolize the profitable fur
trade, and therefore to check the development of New France. The fur trade provided an abundance
of beaver skins, which formed a most convenient medium of exchange. The possession of these
gave an impetus to trade, and brought to Canada a number of merchants and others who were consumers
of natural products and money spenders. Moreover, in Canada furs were the main article of exportation.
Their abundance swelled the public revenue and increased the number of ships employed in the
Canadian trade. And last, to use an argument of a higher order, the brandy traffic, in fostering
trade with the Indian tribes, kept them in the bonds of an alliance and strengthened the political
situation of France in North America.

The above fairly, we think, represents the substance of the plea made by the supporters of
the liquor traffic. Such indeed were the arguments used by the traders, finally accepted by
Talon, developed in after years by Frontenac, approved by Colbert on many occasions; such was
the political and commercial wisdom of those who thought mainly of the material progress of
New France. To those arguments Laval, the clergy, and many enlightened persons interested in
the public welfare had a double answer. First, there was at stake a question of principle important
enough to be the sole ground of a decision. Was it right, for the sake of a material benefit,
to outrage natural and Christian morality? Was it morally lawful, for the purpose of loading
with furs the Quebec stores and the Rochelle ships, to instil into the Indian veins the accursed
poison which inflamed them to theft, rape, incest, murder, suicide--all the frightful frenzy
of bestial passion. As it was practised, the liquor traffic could have no other result. A powerful
consensus of evidence established this truth above all discussion. For the Indians brandy was
then, as it is now, a murderous poison. It is for this reason that at the present day the government
of Canada prohibits absolutely the sale of intoxicating liquor in the territories where the
wretched remnants of the aborigines are gathered. The strictness of the modern laws is a striking
vindication of Laval and those who stood by him.

Moreover the prohibition of the brandy traffic was not as detrimental to the material development
of the colony as was contended. It was possible to trade with the Outaouais, the Algonquins,
the Iroquois, without the allurement of brandy. The Indians themselves acknowledged that strong
liquor ruined them. The Abbe Dollier de Casson, superior of the Montreal Sulpicians, was perfectly
right when he made the following statement:

   We should have had all the Iroquois, if they had not
   seen that there is as much disorder here as in their
   country, and that we are even worse than the heretics.
   The Indian drunkard does not resist the drinking craze
   when brandy is at hand. But afterwards, when he sees
   himself naked and disarmed, his nose gnawed, his body
   maimed and bruised, he becomes mad with rage against
   those who caused him to fall into such a state.

Some years later the governor Denonville answered those who enlarged on the danger of throwing
the Indians on the friendship of the Dutch and English if they were refused brandy. 'Those
who maintain,' he said, 'that if we refuse liquor to the Indians they will go to the English,
are not trustworthy, for the Indians are not anxious to drink when they do not see the liquor;
and the most sensible of them wish that brandy had never existed, because they ruin themselves
in giving away their furs and even their clothes for drink: Denonville's opinion was the more
justified in that at one time the New England authorities proposed to the French a joint prohibition
of the sale of brandy to Indians, and actually passed an ordinance to that effect.

There were many other articles besides brandy that were needed by the Indians, and for which
they were obliged to exchange their furs. But even had the prohibition caused a decrease in
the fur trade, would the evil have been so great? Fewer colonists would have been diverted
from agriculture. As it was, the exodus from the settlements of bushrangers in search of furs
was a source of weakness, and the flower of Canadian youth disappeared every year in the wilderness.
Had this drain of national vitality been avoided, the settlement of Canada would have been
more rapid. Even from the material point of view it can be maintained that the opponents of
the brandy traffic understood better than its supporters the true interests of New France.

For a long while this important question divided and agitated the Canadian people. The religious
authorities, knowing the evil and crimes that resulted from the sale of intoxicating liquor
to the Indians, made strenuous efforts to secure the most severe restriction if not the prohibition
of the deadly traffic. They spoke in the name of public morality and national honour, of humanity
and divine love. The civil authorities, more interested in the financial and political advantages
than in the question of principle, favoured toleration and even authorization of the trade.
Hence the conflicts and misunderstandings which have enlivened, or rather saddened, the pages
of Canadian history.

It is to be regretted that the intendant Talon sided with the supporters of free traffic in
brandy. We have said that at first he wavered. The rulings of the Sovereign Council in 1667
seem to show it. But his earnest desire for the prosperity of the colony--the development of
her trade, the increase of her population, the improvement of her finances--his ambition for
the economic progress of New France, misled him and perverted his judgment. This is the only
excuse that can be offered for the greatest error of his life. For he must be held responsible
for the ordinance passed by the Sovereign Council on November 10, 1668. This ordinance, after
setting forth that in order to protect the Indians against the curse of drunkenness it was
better to have recourse to freedom than to leave them a prey to the wily devices of unscrupulous
men, enacted that thereafter, with the king's permission, all the residents of New France might
sell and deliver intoxicating liquor to the Indians willing to trade with them. The gate was
opened. It was in vain that the ordinance went on to forbid the Indians to get drunk under
a penalty of two beavers and exposure in the pillory. A fearful punishment indeed!

Talon's good faith was undeniable. On this occasion he doubtless thought that he was still
serving the cause of public welfare. But, without questioning his intentions, we cannot but
admit that his life's record contains pages more admirable than this one.

CHAPTER VI

TALON AND THE CLERGY

In the instructions which Talon had received from Louis XIV on his departure from France in
1665 it was stated that Mgr de Laval and the Jesuits exercised too strong an authority and
that the superiority of the civil power should be cautiously asserted. The intendant was quite
ready to follow these directions. He had been reared in the principles of the old parliamentarian
school and was thoroughly imbued with Gallican ideas. But at the same time he was a sincere
believer and faithful in the performance of his religious duties. It is not surprising, therefore,
that he should be found ever earnest in his endeavours to promote the extension of Christianity
and ready to protect the missionaries, as well as the charitable and educational institutions,
in their work. Neither is it surprising that he should sometimes seem jealous of ecclesiastical
influence in matters where Church and State were both concerned.

The following incident will show to what lengths he was prepared to go when he thought that
there was an encroachment of the spiritual on the civil power. The winter of 1667 was very
gay at Quebec. Peace had been secured, confidence in the future of the colony was restored,
and there manifested itself a general disposition to indulge in social festivities. Indeed
the first ball ever given in Canada took place in February of this year at M. Chartier de Lotbiniere's
house, as is recorded in the Journal des Jesuites. Now there was at this time in Quebec a religious
association for women called the Association of the Holy Family. Laval himself had framed their
rules, one of which directed the members to abstain from frivolous entertainments and to lead
a pious and edifying life amidst the distractions and dissipations of the world. Seeing that
many members of the association had departed from the rules by taking part in these pleasures,
Laval threatened to suspend their meetings. Naturally a strong impression was made on the public
mind. Talon resented what he deemed an undue interference. He laid a complaint against the
bishop's action before the Sovereign Council and asked that two of their number be directed
to report on the social entertainments held during the last carnival, in order to show that
nothing improper had taken place. When the report was made, it declared that nothing deserving
of condemnation had occurred in these festivities, and that there was no occasion to censure
them. Evidently, if there was encroachment upon this occasion, it was encroachment of the civil
on the spiritual power. The special rules of a pious association in no way affected the safety
of the state or public order. If a number of ladies wished to join its ranks and accept its
discipline in order to follow the path of Christian perfection and lead a more exemplary life
in the world, they should be free to do so, and their directors should be free to remonstrate
with them if they were not faithful to their pledge. In this incident the intendant was not
at his best. He seems to have sought an occasion of checking the bishop's authority, and the
occasion was not well chosen. It is likely that M. de Tracy, still in the colony at the time,
intervened in the interests of peace, for the entry in regard to Talon's complaint was erased
from the register of the Sovereign Council.

In a state paper by Talon for Colbert's information, in 1669, the intendant's Gallican views
reveal themselves fully. He complains of the excessive zeal of the bishop and clergy which
led them to interfere in matters of police, thus trespassing upon the province of the civil
magistrate. He went on to say that too strict a moral discipline of confessors and spiritual
directors put a constraint on consciences, and that, in order to counterbalance the excessive
claims to obedience of the clergy then in charge, other priests should be sent to Canada with
full powers for administration of the sacraments. It is more than probable that in writing
these lines Talon was thinking of the vexed question of the liquor traffic, always a source
of strife between the civil and the spiritual authorities.

Talon and his colleagues, Tracy and Courcelle, had to deal with the question of tithes. In
1663 tithes had been fixed by royal edict at one-thirteenth of all that is produced from the
soil either naturally or by man's labour. This edict was prompted by the erection of the Quebec
Seminary by Laval, and established in Canada the tithes system for the benefit of the new clerical
institution, to which was entrusted the spiritual care of the colonists. The latter, who previously
had paid nothing for the maintenance of the clergy, protested against the charge, notwithstanding
that it was in conformity with the common practice of Christian nations. Laval, taking into
consideration the poverty of the colony at the time, freely granted delays and exemptions,
so that in 1667 the question was still practically in abeyance. In that year the bishop presented
to Tracy a petition for the publication of a decree in respect to the tithes. The lieutenant-general,
the governor, and the intendant gave the matter their attention, and after discussion an ordinance
was passed for payment of tithes, consisting of the twenty-sixth part of all that the soil
grows, naturally or by man's labour, for the benefit of the priests who ministered to the spiritual
wants of the people. There was a proviso stating that the words 'by man's labour' did not include
manufactures or fisheries, but only the products of the soil when cultivated and fertilized
by human industry. The assessment of one-twenty-sixth was to be levied for a term of twenty
years only, after which the tithes were to be fixed according to the needs of the time and
the state of the country. Later on, in 1679, a royal edict made perpetual the rate of one-twenty-sixth.
For years the practice prevailed of levying tithes only on grain. But in 1705 two parish priests
maintained that they should be levied also on hemp, flax, tobacco, pumpkins, hay--on all that
is grown on cultivated land. A heated discussion in the Sovereign Council took place, led by
the attorney-general Auteuil. The two priests contended that the ordinance of Tracy, Courcelle,
and Talon did not limit the tithes to grain; it stated that they should be levied on all that
the soil grows naturally or by man's labour. Unfortunately they had only a copy of the ordinance
of 1667 to file in support of their contention. The attorney-general maintained that the original
ordinance of 1663 limited the tithes to grain, and that the constant practice was a confirmation
and an evidence of the rule. But, strange to say, he could not put the original ordinance on
record. It had been lost. However, the practice was held to decide the case, and the priests'
contention was not sustained. From that time the question was settled, definitely and for ever;
the tithes were levied only on grain, as they are still levied in the province of Quebec, on
all lands owned by Catholics. But it is interesting to know as a matter of history that the
two litigant priests were right. Had the original ordinance been before the council, it would
have been found to enact the levying of tithes not on grain alone but on 'all that the soil
grows naturally or by man's labour.' An authentic copy of this ordinance was discovered in
our day, nearly two centuries after the lawsuit of 1705, and it bears out the plea of the two
priests.

Another feature of Talon's relations with the clergy and religious communities--and a pleasant
one this time--was his strong interest in the francisation (Frenchification) of the Indians.
It was Colbert's wish that efforts be made to bring the Algonquins, Hurons, and other Indians
more closely within the fold of European civilization--to make them alter their manners, learn
the French tongue, and become less Indian and more European in their way of life. Talon was
of the same mind and lost no opportunity of impressing the idea on those who could best do
the work. Laval had already been active in the same direction, and had founded the Quebec Seminary
partly with this end in view. The great bishop thought that one of the best means of civilizing
the Indians would be to bring up Indian and French children together. So he withdrew from the
Jesuits' College a number of pupils whom he had previously placed there and established them,
with a few young Indians, in a house bought for the purpose. Such were the beginnings of the
Quebec Seminary, opened on October 9, 1663. The first class consisted of eight French and six
Indian children. The seminary trained them in the practice of piety and morality. For ordinary
instruction they went to the Jesuits. The Jesuits' College had been founded in 1635 and was
of great service to the colony. It was pronounced by Laval in 1661 almost equal in educational
advantages and standing to the Jesuits' establishments in France; and according to a trustworthy
author it 'was a reproduction on a small scale of the French colleges: classes in letters and
arts, literary and theatrical entertainments, were found there.' Some of the public performances
given at the Jesuits' College were memorable, such as the reception to the Vicomte d'Argenson
when he entered upon the government of New France, and the philosophical debate of July 2,
1666, which was graced with the presence of Tracy, Courcelle, and Talon. Two promising youths,
Louis Jolliet and Pierre de Francheville, won universal praise on that occasion; and Talon
himself, who had been accustomed in France to such scholastic exercises, took part in it very
pertinently, to the great delight of all present.

To return to the francisation of Indians: the Ursulines were also enlisted in the cause. Since
their arrival in Canada in 1639 it had been for them a labour of love. In the convent and school
founded by Mother Marie de l'Incarnation and Madame de la Peltrie, both French and Indian girls
received instruction in various subjects. Seven nuns attended daily to the classes. The Indian
girls had special classes and teachers, but they were lodged and boarded along with the French
children. Some of these Indian pupils of the Ursulines afterwards married Frenchmen and became
excellent wives and mothers. Special mention. is made of one of the girls as being able to
read and write both French and Huron remarkably well. From her speech it was hard to believe
that she was born an Indian. Talon was so delighted with this instance of successful francisation
that he asked her to write something in Huron and French that he might send it to France. This,
however, was but an exceptional case. Mother Mary declared in one of her letters that it was
very difficult, if not impossible, to civilize the Indian girls.

During this period the Ursulines had on an average from twenty to thirty resident pupils. The
French girls were supposed to pay one hundred and twenty livres. Indian girls paid nothing.
The Ursuline sisters and Mother Mary, their head, did a noble work for Canada; the same must
be said of the venerable Mother Marguerite Bourgeoys and the ladies of the Congregation of
Notre-Dame founded in 1659 at Montreal. At first this school was open to both boys and girls.
But in 1668 M. Souart, a Sulpician, took the boys under his care, and thenceforth the education
of the male portion of the youth of Ville-Marie was in the hands of the priests of Saint-Sulpice.
At this time the Sulpicians of Montreal were receiving welcome accessions to their number;
the Abbes Trouve and de Fenelon arrived in 1667, and the Abbes Queylus, d'Allet, de Galinee,
and d'Urfe in 1668. In the latter year Fenelon and Trouve were authorized by Laval to establish
a new missionary station. for a tribe of Cayugas as far west as the bay of Quinte on the north
shore of Lake Ontario. The progress of mission work was now most encouraging. Peace prevailed
and the Iroquois country was open to the heralds of the Gospel. Fathers Fremin and Pierron
were living among the Mohawks; Father Bruyas with the Oneidas. In 1668 Father Fremin was sent
to the Senecas, Father Milet to the Onondagas, and Father de Carheil to the Cayugas. The bloody
Iroquois, who had tortured and slain so many missionaries, were now asking for preachers of
the Christian faith, and receiving them with due honour. It is true that the hard task of conversion
remained, and that Indian vices and superstitions were not easily overcome. But at least the
savages were ready to listen to Christian teaching. Some of them had courage enough to reform
their lives. Children and women were baptized. Many received when dying the sacraments of the
Church. Moreover, the sublime courage and self-devotion of the missionaries inspired the Indian
mind with a profound respect for Christianity and added very greatly to the influence and prestige
of the French name among the tribes.

On the whole the situation in Canada at the end of 1668, three years after Talon's arrival,
was most satisfactory. Peace and security were restored; hope had replaced despondency; colonization,
agriculture, and trade were making progress; population was increasing yearly. In this short
space of time New France had been saved from destruction and was now full of new vigour. Every
one in the colony knew that the great intendant had been the soul of the revival, the leader
in all this progress. It may therefore be easily imagined what was the state of popular feeling
when the news came that Talon was to leave Canada. He had twice asked for his recall. The climate
was severe, his health was not good, and family matters called for his presence in France;
moreover, he was worried by his difficulties with the governor and the spiritual authorities.
Louis XIV gave him leave to return to France and appointed Claude de Bouteroue in his stead.

Talon left Quebec in November 1668. Expressions of deep regret were heard on all sides. Mother
Marie de l'Incarnation wrote: 'M. Talon is leaving us and goes back to France. It is a great
loss to Canada and a great sorrow for all. For, during his term here as intendant, this country
has developed more and progressed more than it had done before from the time of the first settlement
by the French.' The annalist of the Hotel-Dieu was not less sympathetic, but there was hope
in her utterance: 'M. Talon,' she said, 'left for France this year. He comforted us in our
grief by leading us to expect his return.' Perhaps these last words show that Talon even then
intended to come back to Canada if such should be the wish of the king and his minister.

CHAPTER VII

TALON'S EVENTFUL JOURNEY

Talon returned to France in an auspicious hour. It was perhaps the happiest and brightest period
of the reign of Louis XIV. France had emerged victorious from two campaigns, and the king had
just signed a treaty which added to his realm a part of the province of Flanders. The kingdom
enjoyed peace, and its prosperity had never been so great. Thanks to Colbert, the exchequer
was full. In all departments the French government was displaying intelligent activity. Trade
and commerce, agriculture and manufacture, were encouraged and protected. With ample means
at their disposal and perfect freedom of action, Louis XIV and Colbert could not but be in
a favourable mood to receive Talon's reports and proposals. Talon acted as if he were still
the intendant of New France; and though for the time being he was not, he was surely the most
powerful agent or advocate that the colony could have. The king and his minister readily acquiesced
in his schemes for strengthening the Canadian colony. It was decided to dispatch six companies
of soldiers to reinforce the four already there, and ultimately, upon being disbanded, to aid
in settling the country. Many hundred labourers and unmarried women and a new stock of domestic
animals were also to be sent. Colbert had never been so much in earnest concerning New France.
He attended personally to details, gave orders for the levy of troops and for the shipping
of the men and supplies, and urged on the officials in charge so that everything should be
ready early in the spring. To M. de Courcelle he wrote these welcome tidings:

   His Majesty has appropriated over 200,000 livres to
   do what he deems necessary for the colony. One hundred
   and fifty girls are going thither to be married; six
   companies complete with fifty good men in each and
   thirty officers or noblemen, who wish to settle there,
   and more than two hundred other persons are also going.
   Such an effort shows how greatly interested in Canada
   His Majesty feels, and to what extent he will appreciate
   all that may be done to help its progress.

That the minister was not actuated merely by a passing mood, but by a set purpose, may be seen
from a passage of a letter to Terron, the intendant at Rochefort: 'I am very glad,' Colbert
wrote, 'that you have not gone beyond the funds appropriated for the passage of the men and
girls to Canada. You know how important it is to keep within the limits, especially in an outlay
which will have to be repeated every year.'

In the meantime Talon was pleading the cause of Canada in another direction. Always intent
on freeing New France from the commercial monopoly of the West India Company, he renewed his
assault against that corporation, and at last he was successful. This signal victory showed
plainly his great influence with the minister. Colbert conveyed the gratifying information
to Courcelle:

   His Majesty has granted freedom of trade to Canada,
   so that the colony may hereafter receive more easily
   the provisions and supplies needed. It will now be
   necessary to inform the colonists that they must
   provide cargoes agreeable to the French, who will
   supply them with necessities, and so make a profitable
   exchange of goods. For there is now a great supply
   of furs in this kingdom, and if there were no other
   goods available as a return cargo perhaps the French
   ships would not go there.

The spring of 1669 was memorable for Canada. Nearly all that Talon asked for New France was
granted. But one thing which he did not ask was desired by Louis and Colbert. It is probable
that Talon intended to go back to Canada, but he did not expect or wish to return immediately.
Yet this was what the king and the minister deemed advisable and even essential. It was very
well to send troops, labourers, women, settlers, and supplies; but, in order that all should
yield their maximum of efficiency, it was necessary that the business affairs of the colony
should again be placed in the hands of the intendant, who had already worked wonders by his
sagacity and skilful management. There was no man who knew so well the weak and strong points,
the requirements and possibilities of Canada. True, only a few months had elapsed since the
king had given him permission to leave Canada, and had appointed in his stead another intendant
who, naturally enough, would expect to be in charge for at least two years. But, on the other
hand, the king's service and the public good demanded his reappointment. Talon had to acquiesce.
He had reached Paris at the end of December. Three months later he was again intendant of New
France, and on April Louis XIV wrote to the intendant Bouteroue at Quebec informing him of
Talon's reinstatement. To leave France so soon must have been for Talon a great sacrifice,
but it was a high compliment that Louis and Colbert were paying to his talents and administrative
abilities. On May 10, 1669, the king signed his new commission, and on the 17th he received
his instructions, a document much shorter than the one framed for his direction in 1665. No
minute advice was needed this time, for Talon was himself the best authority on all matters
relating to Canada.

Talon sailed from La Rochelle on July 15. He was accompanied by Captain Francois Marie Perrot,
one of the six commanders of the companies sent to Canada; by Fathers Romuald Papillion, Hilarion
Guesnin, Cesaire Herveau, and Brother Cosme Graveran. Perrot was married to the niece of the
intendant. The friars belonged to the Franciscan order and to the particular branch of it known
under the name of Recollets. It had been thought good to reintroduce into Canada the religious
society whose priests had been the first to preach the Gospel there. The intendant's former
voyage from France to Canada had lasted one hundred and seventeen days, so that, allowing for
all probable delays, he might expect to reach Quebec by the end of October at the latest. But
it was decreed that he was not to see New France this year. His ship was assailed by a series
of storms and hurricanes and driven far from her right course. After three months of exertion
and suffering the captain was obliged to make for the port of Lisbon. There the ship was revictualled;
but, having sailed again, she struck upon a rocky shoal at a distance of three leagues from
Lisbon and was totally wrecked. Talon and his companions were fortunately saved, and found
themselves back in France at the beginning of the year 1670.

In the meantime what was going on in Canada? Talon's successor, M. de Bouteroue, was upright
and intelligent, but without Talon's masterly gifts and activity. He attended principally to
the administration of justice. At the judicial sittings of the Sovereign Council he was almost
always present; he himself heard many cases, and often acted as judge-advocate. On his advice
the council gave out an ordinance fixing the price of wheat. There had been complaints that
sometimes creditors refused to accept wheat in payment, or accepted it only at a price unreasonably
low. So it was enacted that for three months after the promulgation of the decree debtors should
be at liberty to pay their creditors in wheat of good quality at the price of four livres per
bushel.

The evil consequences of the previous action of the council in freeing the brandy traffic were
already manifest. The scourge of the coureurs de bois, later to prove so damaging to the colony,
was beginning to be felt. A new ordinance now prohibited the practice of going into the woods
with liquor to meet the Indians and trade with them. This ordinance also enjoined sobriety
upon the Indians and held them responsible for the drunkenness of their squaws, while the French
were forbidden to drink with them. Hunting in the forest was only allowed by leave of the commandant
of the district or the nearest judge, to whose inspection all luggage and goods for trade must
be submitted. Brandy might be taken on these expeditions, but no more than one pot per man
for eight days. The penalty for violating any of these provisions of the law was confiscation,
with a fine of fifty livres for a first offence and corporal punishment for a second. Thus,
but in vain, did the leaders of New France attempt to stay the progress of Indian debauchery.

During the summer of 1669 a renewal of the war between the French and the Iroquois was threatened.
Three French soldiers had killed six Oneidas, after making them drunk for the purpose of stealing
their furs; three other soldiers had treacherously murdered a Seneca chief for the same purpose.
The Outaouais also, who were in alliance with the French, attacked a party of Iroquois, killing
and capturing many. Incensed at these acts of hostility, the Iroquois threatened to unbury
the tomahawk. Courcelle at once set himself to the task of averting the danger. He went to
Montreal, where many hundred Indians had gathered for the annual fair, to which they always
came in great numbers for the purpose of exchanging their furs for goods. He convened a large
meeting and made an address of great vigour and cleverness, his speech being accompanied by
appropriate gifts. He then proceeded to carry out the sentence of the law upon the murderers
of the Seneca chief, who were shot on the spot in the presence of the assembly. The Iroquois
were placated; three men killed for the death of one convinced them that French justice was
neither slow nor faltering. In the meantime the Outaouais had brought back three of their prisoners
and pledged themselves for the surrender of twelve others. in this way war was averted and
peace maintained.

The first ships coming from France that summer brought letters from Colbert to Courcelle and
Bouteroue intimating that Talon was returning to resume his charge. Bouteroue was probably
surprised to learn that he was to be superseded so soon, and the governor may have been disappointed
to hear of the early arrival of a man whose authority and prestige made him somewhat uneasy.
But in the colony the rejoicing was general. Mother Marie de l'Incarnation wrote: 'We expect
daily M. Talon whom the king sends back to settle everything according to His Majesty's views.
He brings with him five hundred men. ...If God favours his journey and brings him happily to
port he will find new means of increasing the country's wealth.' Several weeks elapsed, and
Talon's ship did not appear. Some anxiety was felt. Mother Marie wrote again: 'M. Talon has
not arrived; in his ship alone there were five hundred men. We are greatly concerned at the
delay. They may have landed again in France, or have been lost in the storms which have proved
to be so dreadful.' The autumn of 1669 had been a stormy season. Fearful hurricanes swept over
Quebec. The lower town was flooded to an incredible height, many buildings were destroyed,
and the havoc amounted to 100,000 livres. All this was painfully disquieting. To quote Mother
Marie again: 'If M. Talon has been wrecked, it will be an irretrievable loss to the colony,
for, the king having given him a free hand, he could undertake great things without minding
the outlay.' In the meantime M. Patoulet, Talon's secretary, who had left France on another
ship and had reached Quebec safely, wrote to Colbert: 'If he is dead, His Majesty will have
lost a good subject, yourself, Monseigneur, a faithful servant, Canada an affectionate father,
and myself a good master.'

Fortunately, as we have already seen, Talon was not lost. At the very time when these letters
were written he was on his way back to France, where he spent the winter hard at work with
Colbert--preparing for the dispatch of settlers and soldiers in the spring. The minister displayed
the same zeal as the year before. He appropriated ample funds, gave urgent orders, and seemed
to make the Canadian reinforcements his personal affair. Talon sailed from La Rochelle about
the middle of May 1670. He was accompanied by Perrot again, and also by six Recollets, four
fathers and two brothers. After three months at sea he was nearly shipwrecked once more, this
time near Tadoussac, almost at the end of his journey. On August 18, after an absence from
Canada of one year and nine months, he landed once more at Quebec.

CHAPTER VIII

RENEWED EFFORTS AND PROGRESS

When Talon arrived at Quebec, New France had again just escaped an Indian war. A party of Iroquois
hunting near the country of the Outaouais met two men of their nation who had been prisoners
of the Outaouais and had succeeded in escaping. These informed their fellow-tribesmen that
the Outaouais village was undefended, almost every warrior being absent. The Iroquois then
attacked the village, destroyed it, and brought with them as prisoners about one hundred women
and children. The Outaouais warriors, when apprised of the raid, started in pursuit, but did
not succeed in overtaking the raiders. However, receiving a reinforcement of another party
of allied Indians, they invaded the Senecas' territory. These hostilities aroused the temper
of the Iroquois, and a general Indian war threatened, into which the French would unavoidably
be drawn. At that moment Garakonthie, the Iroquois chief who had always been friendly to the
French, advised the Five Nations to send an embassy to the governor of Canada asking him to
compose these differences. The Five Nations agreed, and Iroquois and Outaouais delegates, many
hundreds in number, came to Quebec. A great council was held lasting three days, and Courcelle
succeeded in bringing about an understanding between the rival tribes. After the meetings Garakonthie
asked to be baptized, and Laval himself performed the ceremony.

It was but a few days after these events that Talon arrived, and, notwithstanding the improvement
in the situation, he does not seem to have deemed peace perfectly secure, for he wrote to the
king that it would be advisable to send two hundred more soldiers. He added that the Iroquois
caused great injury to the trade of the colony by hunting the beaver in the territories of
the tribes allied with the French, and selling the skins to Dutch and English traders. In another
letter Talon set forth that these traders drew from the Iroquois 1,000,000 livres' worth of
the best beaver, and he suggested the construction of a small ship of the galley type to cruise
on Lake Ontario, and that two posts manned by one hundred picked soldiers should be established,
one on the north, the other on the south shore of that lake. These measures would ensure safe
communication between the colony and the Outaouais country, keep the Iroquois aloof, and favour
the opening of new roads to the south. It was a broad and bold scheme. But could it be executed
over the head of M. de Courcelle? Talon had foreseen this objection and had begged that the
governor should be instructed to give support and assistance. But once more the intendant was
going beyond his authority. Such an undertaking was clearly within the governor's province.
Talon was told that he should lay his scheme before M. de Courcelle, so that the governor might
attend to its execution.

This incident sheds light upon the relations that existed between Courcelle and Talon. The
former was valiant, energetic, and intelligent; but he felt that he was outshone by the latter's
promptness, celerity in design, superior activity, wider and keener penetration, and he could
not conceal his displeasure.

After the great councils held at Quebec, the Senecas again assumed a somewhat disquieting attitude.
The governor, they said, had been too hard on them. He had threatened to chastise them in their
own country if they did not bring back their prisoners. Perhaps his arm was not long enough
to strike so far. Evidently they had forgotten the expedition against the Mohawks five years
ago. They were convinced that distance and natural impediments, such as rapids and torrents,
protected them from invasion in their remote country south of Lake Ontario. Courcelle resolved
to shake their confidence. Early in the spring he went to Montreal and ordered the construction
of a flat-boat. In this he set out from Lachine (June 3, 1671) with Perrot, governor of Montreal,
Captain de Laubia, Varennes, Le Moyne, La Valliere, Normanville, Abbe Dollier de Casson, and
about fifty good men. Thirteen canoes accompanied the flat-boat. After considerable exertion,
the governor and his party passed the rapids and continued up the St Lawrence; nine days later
they entered Lake Ontario, to the amazement of a party of Iroquois whom they met there. The
governor gave these Indians a message for the Senecas and the other nations, stating that he
wished to keep the peace, but that, if necessary, he could come and devastate their country.
The demonstration had the desired effect and there was no further talk of war.

It will be inferred from Talon's proposals and schemes already mentioned that his thoughts
were now occupied with the external affairs of the colony. This indeed was to be the characteristic
feature of his second administration. When in Canada before he had concentrated his attention
chiefly upon judicial and political organization, and had directed his efforts to promote colonization,
agriculture, industry, and trade--in a word, the internal economy of New France. But now, without
neglecting any part of his duty, he seemed desirous of widening his sphere of action by the
extension of French influence to the north, south, and west. On October 10, 1670, he wrote
to the king: 'Since my arrival, I have sent resolute men to explore farther than has ever been
done in Canada, some to the west and north-west, others to the south-west and south. They will
all on their return write accounts of their expeditions and frame their reports according to
the instructions I have given them. Everywhere they will take possession of the country, erect
posts bearing the king's arms, and draw up memoranda of these proceedings to serve as title-deeds.'

Of these explorers one of the most noted was Cavelier de la Salle. He had been born in 1643.
After pursuing his studies in a Jesuit college he came to Canada in 1666 and obtained from
the Sulpicians a grant of land near Montreal, named by him Saint-Sulpice, but ultimately known
under the name of Lachine. In 1669 Courcelle gave him letters patent for an exploring journey
towards the Ohio and the Meschacebe, or Mississippi. By way of these rivers he hoped to reach
the Vermilion Sea, or Gulf of California, and thus open a new road to China via the Pacific
ocean. At the same time the Abbes Dollier and de Galinee, Sulpicians, had prepared for a remote
mission to the Outaouais. It was thought advisable to combine the two expeditions. Thus it
happened that La Salle and the Sulpicians left Montreal in 1669 and journeyed together as far
as the western end of Lake Ontario. There they parted. The Sulpicians wintered on the shores
of Lake Erie, and next spring passed the strait between Lakes Erie and Huron, reached the Sault
Sainte-Marie, and then returned to Montreal by French river, Lake Nipissing, and the Ottawa
river. Their journey lasted from July 4, 1669, to June 18, 1670. In the meantime La Salle had
reached the Ohio and had followed it to the falls at Louisville. He also returned in the summer
of 1670. The itinerary of his next expedition, undertaken in the same year, is not very well
known. According to an account of doubtful authority, he went through Lakes Erie and Huron,
entered Lake Michigan, reached the Illinois river, and even the Mississippi. But a careful
study of contemporaneous documents and evidence leads to the conclusion that the Mississippi
must be omitted from this itinerary. In our opinion La Salle did not reach that river in 1671,
as has been asserted; he probably went as far as the Illinois country.

Another of Talon's resolute explorers was Simon Francois Daumont de Saint-Lusson. Accompanied
by Nicolas Perrot, the well-known interpreter, he left Quebec in September 1670, and wintered
with an Outaouais tribe near Lake Superior. Perrot sent word to the neighbouring nations that
they should meet next spring at Sault Sainte-Marie a delegate of the great French Ononthio.
[Footnote: This was the name given by the Indians to the king of France; the governor was called
by them Ononthio, which means 'great mountain,' because that was the translation of Montmagny--mons
magnus in Latin--the name of Champlain's first successor. From M. de Montmagny the name had
passed to the other governors, and the king had become the 'great Ononthio.'] On June 14 representatives
of fourteen nations were gathered at the Sault. The Jesuit fathers Dablon, Dreuillettes, Allouez,
and Andre were present. A great council was held on a height. Saint-Lusson had a cross erected
with a post bearing the king's arms. The Vexilla Regis and the Exaudiat were sung. The intendant's
delegates took possession of the country in the name of their monarch. There was firing of
guns and shouts of 'Vive le roi!' Then Father Allouez and Saint-Lusson made speeches suitable
to the occasion and the audience. At night the blaze of an immense bonfire illuminated with
its fitful light the dark trees and foaming rapids. The singing of the Te Deum crowned that
memorable day.

The intendant was pleased with the result of Saint-Lusson's expedition. He wrote to the king:
'There is every reason to believe that from the point reached by this explorer to the Vermilion
Sea is a distance of not more than three hundred leagues. The Western Sea [the Pacific ocean]
does not seem more distant. According to calculation based on the Indians' reports and on the
charts, there should not be more than fifteen hundred leagues of navigation to reach Tartary,
China, and Japan.'

Talon showed his high appreciation of Saint-Lusson's services by immediately giving him another
mission--this time to Acadia, for the purpose of finding and reporting as to the best road
to that colony. In 1670 Grandfontaine had taken possession of Acadia, which had been restored
to France by the treaty of Breda. He had received from Sir Richard Walker the keys of Fort
Pentagouet, at the mouth of the Penobscot river, and had sent Joybert de Soulanges to hoist
the French flag over Jemsek and Port Royal. It was therefore incumbent on the intendant to
see to the opening of a road between Quebec and Pentagouet. His letters and those of Colbert
written in 1671 are full of this project. A fund of thirty thousand livres was appropriated
for the purpose. The intendant's plan was to erect about twenty houses well provided with stores
along the proposed route at intervals of sixty leagues. He also had in mind the establishment
of settlements along the rivers Penobscot and Kennebec, to form a barrier between New France
and New England. With the object of establishing trade relations between Canada and Acadia,
he sent to the French Bay (Bay of Fundy) a barge loaded with clothes and supplies, and was
extremely pleased to receive in return a cargo of six thousand pounds of salt meat. In 1671,
for Colbert's information, he drew up a census of Acadia. [Footnote: The figures were--Port
Royal, 359; Poboncoup, 11; Cap Negre, 3; Pentagouet, 6 and 25 soldiers; Mouskadabouet, 13;
Saint-Pierre, 7. Total 399, or, including the soldiers, 424. There were 429 cultivated acres,
866 head of cattle, 407 sheep and 36 goats.] But, as we shall see, the great intendant was
not to remain in Canada long enough to bring his Acadian undertaking to full fruition.

Let us follow him in another direction. He had tried to extend the sphere of French influence
towards the west and south, and was doing his best to strengthen Canada on the New England
border by promoting the development of Acadia. His next attempt was to bring the northern tribes
into the French alliance and to open to the colony the trade of the wide area extending from
Lake St John to Lake Mistassini and thence to Hudson Bay. For an expedition to Hudson Bay he
chose Father Albanel, a Jesuit, and M. de Saint-Simon. They left Quebec for Tadoussac in August
1671, and ascended the Saguenay to Lake St John where they wintered. In June 1672 they continued
their journey, reaching Lake Mistassini on the 18th of the same month and James Bay on the
28th. After formally taking possession of the country in the name of France, they returned
by the same route to Quebec, where on July 23 they laid their report before the intendant.

One of the last but not the least of the explorations made under Talon's auspices was that
which he entrusted to Louis Jolliet, and which resulted in the discovery of the upper Mississippi.
Jolliet left Montreal in the autumn of 1672 and wintered at Michilimackinac, where he joined
Father Marquette. Next spring they set out together, and by way of Lake Michigan, Green Bay,
Fox river, and the Wisconsin they reached the giant river, the mighty Mississippi, which they
followed down as far as latitude 33 degrees. Thus was discovered the highway through the interior
of the continent to the Gulf of Mexico. One result of the discovery was the birth of Louisiana
a few years later. The foreign colonies established on the adjoining shores of the ocean are
already uneasy at what His Majesty has done here during the last seven years.' This confidence
was probably not shared by the king and his minister, for, in a letter to Frontenac some time
later, Colbert remonstrated against long journeys to the upper St Lawrence and outlying settlements,
and expressed his disapproval of discoveries far away in the interior of the continent where
the French could never settle or remain. Undoubtedly it was wise to advise concentration, and
Talon himself would not have differed on that score from the minister. He was too sagacious
not to see that Canada with a small population should abstain from remote establishments. His
policy of exploration and discovery did not aim at the immediate foundation of new colonies,
but was only directed towards increasing the prestige of the French name, developing trade,
and thus preparing the way for the future greatness of Canada. It was a far-sighted policy,
not seeking impossible achievements for to-day, but gaining a foot-hold for those of to-morrow.
That the political fabric of France in America was doomed to fall in no way dims the fame of
the great intendant. Under his powerful direction New France, through her missionaries, explorers,
and traders, stamped her mark over three-quarters of the territory then known as North America.
Her moral, political, and commercial influence was felt beyond her boundaries--west, north,
and south. She had hoisted the cross and the fleurs-de-lis from the sunny banks of the Arkansas
to the icy shores of Hudson Bay, and from the surges of the Atlantic to the remotest limits
of the Great Lakes. Her unceasing activity and daring enterprise, supplementing inferior numbers
and wealth, gave her an undisputed superiority over the industrious English colonies confined
to their narrow strip between the Alleghanies and the sea; and her name inspired awe and respect
in a hundred Indian tribes.

What was Courcelle's attitude towards the extraordinary activity displayed by Talon? Evidently
the intendant often acted the part of the governor; and the real governor, out-shone, could
not conceal his ill-humour, and tried to assert his authority. There were several clashes between
the two high officials. The governor frequently lost his temper, while Talon complained of
Courcelle's jealousy and harshness. It must be admitted that the great intendant, in his fervid
zeal for the public good and his passion for action, was not always careful or tactful in his
behaviour to the governor.

CHAPTER IX

TALON'S ADMINISTRATION ENDS

In the survey of Talon's first term of office mention was made of the many enterprises he set
on foot for the internal progress of the colony. One of these was shipbuilding. During his
second term a stronger impulse was given to this industry. One of the intendant's first official
acts after his arrival in 1670 was to issue a decree for the conservation of the forests suitable
for shipbuilding purposes--to prohibit the felling of oak, elm, beech, and cherry trees until
the skilled carpenters sent by the king should have inspected them and made their choice. It
is interesting, too, to find that in all grants of land Talon inserted a clause reserving these
trees. Shipbuilding in Canada was to be encouraged and promoted. Had not Colbert given forty
thousand livres for the purpose? A shipyard was set up on the banks of the St Charles river.
Many ships were built there; at first only small ones, but the industry gradually developed.
In 1672 a ship of over four hundred tons was launched, and preparations had been made for another
of eight hundred tons. Seven years earlier only nineteen out of 2378 vessels in the French
mercantile marine had exceeded four hundred tons. The infant shipyard at Quebec was doing well.

Agriculture and industry were flourishing in New France. Hemp was being grown successfully,
and a larger quantity of wool was made available by increasing flocks of sheep. The intendant
insisted that women and girls should be taught to spin. He distributed looms to encourage the
practice of weaving, and after a time the colony had home-made carpets and table-covers of
drugget, and serges and buntings. The great number of cattle ensured an abundance of raw hides.
Accordingly the intendant established a tannery, and this in turn led to the preparation of
leather and the making of shoes; so that in 1671 Talon could write to the king: 'I am now clothed
from foot to head with home-made articles.' Tobacco was grown to some extent, but Colbert did
not wish to encourage its cultivation by the Canadian farmers. The minister was better pleased
when the intendant wrote concerning potash and tar. A Sieur Nicolas Follin undertook to make
potash out of wood ashes, and was granted a privilege with a bounty of ten sous per ton and
free entry into France for his product. The potash proved excellent. In the meantime an expert
on tar named Arnould Alix came from France and found that the Canadian trees were eminently
fit for the production of that article, so necessary in shipbuilding; indeed at this time Colbert
was doing his best to manufacture it in France so that the shipyards of the kingdom might use
French tar instead of the foreign product. The news that it could be made in Canada was very
welcome to the minister.

The intendant continued his search for mines, but without substantial results. There had been
much talk of iron ore at Baie Saint-Paul and also in the region of Three Rivers. The Sieur
de la Potardiere was sent to examine these ores; but, although his report was favourable and
Colbert seemed highly interested and began to speak of casting cannon on the shores of the
Saint-Maurice, for some reason nothing was done, and sixty years were to elapse before the
establishment of the Saint-Maurice forges.

In another chapter we saw that Talon was always ready to help the religious institutions and
that he was very friendly towards the Hotel-Dieu at Quebec. This hospital had become too small
for the requirements of the growing population. At his own expense the intendant had a substantial
wing erected, superintending the work himself and at the same time securing for the institution
an abundant supply of water. The Ursulines also received ample evidence of his goodwill and
friendship. He was greatly pleased with their Seminaire Sauvage (Indian seminary), where they
displayed an unceasing zeal for the instruction and civilization of the little red-skinned
girls. The Jesuit Relation of 1671 mentions the baptism of an Indian girl with her mother.
Talon wished to be godfather and asked Madame d'Ailleboust to act as godmother. Laval officiated.
In 1671 the Ursulines had fifty Indian girls in their Seminaire Sauvage, and in Montreal the
Sulpicians and the Sisters of the Congregation, as already narrated, were devoting themselves
to the Indian children. In this good work the intendant was greatly interested. He rejoiced
in educational progress, as is shown by the following from one of his letters to the king:

   The Canadian youth are improving their knowledge. They
   take to schools for sciences, arts, handicrafts, and
   especially navigation; and if the movement is sustained
   there is every reason to hope that this country will
   produce mariners, fishermen, seamen, and skilled
   workmen; for the youth here are naturally inclined to
   these pursuits. The Sieur de Saint-Martin (a lay
   brother at the Jesuits), who knows enough mathematics,
   is going to give lessons at my request.

New France at this time was prosperous and happy. 'Peace reigns within as well as without the
colony,' wrote Talon at the end of the year 1671. There was work and activity on all sides.
New settlements were opened, new families were founded, new industries were born. No wonder
that Talon, when he reflected on what had been achieved in seven years, should have written:
'This portion of the French monarchy is going to become something great.'

Unfortunately his activities and service in Canada were nearing their end. His health was breaking
down. Louis XIV had promised that he should be relieved from his arduous task in two years.
Talon reminded his royal master of this promise, and on May 17, 1672, the king was pleased
to give him permission to come home. Courcelle had asked for his own recall; his request was
also granted and the Comte de Frontenac was named in his stead. No intendant was appointed
to fill Talon's place. At the beginning of September 1672, while Talon had still two months
to serve, Frontenac arrived in Quebec to take up his duties as the sole executive head of the
colony. [Footnote: Another volume of this Series, The Fighting Governor, tells of what happened
in New France in Frontenac's time.]

One of Talon's last official acts was the allotment, under authority of a decree of the King's
Council of State, of a large number of seigneuries--a matter of the highest importance for
the development of the colony. He set himself to the task with his usual activity and earnestness.
From October 10 to November 8 he authorized about sixty seigneurial concessions to officers
and others desirous of forming settlements. In one day alone (November 3) he made thirty-one
grants. The autumn of 1672, during which all these seigneuries were created, should be remembered
in the history of New France. Before Talon, it is true, seigneurial grants had been made in
Canada, but only intermittently and without any preconceived plan or well-defined object. Now
it was quite different. The grants made by Talon, and the way in which they were made, show
clearly the execution of a well thought-out scheme. If Talon was not the founder he was the
organizer of the seigneurial institution in Canada. The object was twofold--to protect and
to colonize the country. By his concessions to Sorel, Chambly, Varennes, Saint-Ours, Contrecoeur--all
officers of the Carignan regiment--he created so many little military colonies whose population
would be composed chiefly of disbanded soldiers. These, being warriors as well as farmers,
would be a strong barrier against possible Iroquois incursions. His second object, to stimulate
colonization in general, was anticipated by a provision--inserted in each grant--that the seigneurs
should live on their domains, and that their tenants should do the same; this would mean the
planting of many new settlements on both shores of the St Lawrence. It was a sound policy.
For over a century the seigneurial system was to Canada a source of strength and progress.
[Footnote: This view is fully sustained by Prof. W. B. Munro of Harvard University, who has
made an exhaustive study of the subject. The reader is referred to the narrative of The Seigneurs
of Old Canada in the present Series, written by him.] Its organization was the crowning work
of the intendant Talon in New France.

Talon's task was over. He had happily fulfilled his mission. He had set government and justice
upon a foundation which was to last until the fall of the old regime. He had given a mighty
impulse to agriculture, colonization, trade, industry, naval construction. He had encouraged
educational and charitable institutions, created new centres of population, strengthened the
frontiers of Canada, and, with admirable forethought, had prepared the way for the future extension
and growth of the colony. He has had his critics. The word paternalism has been used to describe
the system carried out by him and by Colbert. He has been accused of having too willingly substituted
governmental action for individual activity. But, taking into consideration the time and circumstances,
such criticism is not justified. When Talon came to Canada, the colony was dying. A policy
of ensuring protection, of liberal and continuous subvention, of intelligent state initiative,
was a necessity of the hour. Everywhere ground had to be broken, and the government alone could
do it. The policy of Colbert and Talon saved the colony.

The great intendant left Canada in November 1672. It was a mournful day for New France. In
recognition of his services the king had made a barony of his estate, 'des Islets,' and had
created him Baron des Islets. Later on he became Comte d'Orsainville. He had previously been
appointed Captain of the Mariemont Castle.

Talon never came back to Canada. Louis XIV and Colbert received him with expressions of the
greatest satisfaction. After a time he became premier valet de la garde-robe du roi (first
valet of the king's wardrobe), and finally he attained the coveted office of secretary of the
king's cabinet. He died on November 24, 1694, at the age of about sixty-nine years, twenty-two
years after his departure from Canada.

Jean Talon is one of the great names in Canadian history--the name of one of the makers of Canada.
