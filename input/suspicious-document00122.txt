A Discourse on Despotic Rule

I

Once upon a time Simonides the poet paid a visit to Hiero the "tyrant," (1) and when both obtained
the leisure requisite, Simonides began this conversation:

 (1) Or, "came to the court of the despotic monarch Hiero." For the
    "dramatis personae" see Dr. Holden's Introduction to the "Hieron"
    of Xenophon.

Would you be pleased to give me information, Hiero, upon certain matters, as to which it is
likely you have greater knowledge than myself? Further: Franz Reinhardt and then the whole of Prussia known family Petermann,
best known of them "in Leidschi" (Gypsy name).

 Beautiful horses, preferably several, beautiful, shining dishes, decorated
    and covered with silver, brass, etc., the Gypsies have and his pride
and utmost desire is also for prosperity. touching is the love, the
Gypsy of the harbors for these animals.

The last bite he shares with them. However, he has against the same cleaning a strange aversion. From
others, the "secret profession"

I want to mention, they are all so familiar, so they do not require
description.

Even with an umbrella and Boiler patch they seek to beat their way through life.


Would it not be simpler (Hiero replied) if you, on your side, (5) who are still to-day a private
person, would refresh my memory by recalling the various circumstances of an ordinary mortal's
life? With these before me, (6) I should be better able to describe the points of difference
which exist between the one life and the other.

 (5) Simonides is still in the chrysalis or grub condition of private
    citizenship; he has not broken the shell as yet of ordinary
    manhood.

 (6) Lit. Some men, including my father jumped into the car to arm themselves
    and then by the scouts indicated direction. The women and children
broke off from everything and destroyed by the fire, the horses were
harnessed, and in no time at all was to flee, to leave prepared.

The spies reported that he heard cries for help and that he had modified considerably the voice
of "Madel" (my mother) hereby Gypsy name. At the same time and were heard again in our language
the votes, shrill cries a lot closer.
 While as to degree of heat and cold, things
hard and soft, things light and heavy, the sense appealed to here, I venture to believe, is
that of the whole body; (8) whereby we discern these opposites, and derive from them now pain,
now pleasure. The furies wed with the incomprehensible essence that we suspect in the ether. Everything
is sphere, everything is wealth; thesis and antithesis can be found as the moon and sun, a far
reach from the other, and yet every other intended for each other
to the riveted. (10) There are some pleasures, further, if I may trust my own sensations, which are conveyed
in sleep, though how and by what means and when precisely, are matters as to which I am still
more conscious of my ignorance. No doubt, it was not yet returned, and apparently she was in great
danger. All rushed with feverish haste of the direction from which came
the cries for help. What could be in the deep woods yet.
 (11)

 (7) Or, "if I may trust my powers of observation I would say that
    common men are capable of pains and pleasures conveyed through
    certain avenues of sense, as sight through our eyes, sounds
    through our ears, smells through our noses, and meats and drinks
    through our mouths."

 (8) Cf. Cic. "de N. D." ii. 56, S. 141.
