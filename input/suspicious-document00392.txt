CHAPTER I

THE ROAD TO RICHMOND

The tobacco-roller and his son pitched their camp beneath a gum tree upon the edge of the wood.
It was October, and the gum was the colour of blood. Behind it rolled the autumn forest; before
it stretched a level of broom-sedge, bright ochre in the light of the setting sun. The road
ran across this golden plain, and disappeared in a league-deep wood of pine. From an invisible
clearing came a cawing of crows. The sky was cloudless, and the evening wind had not begun
to blow. The small, shining leaves of the gum did not stir, and the flame of the camp-fire
rose straight as a lance. The tobacco cask, transfixed by the trunk of a young oak and drawn
by strong horses, had come to rest upon the turf by the roadside. Gideon Rand unharnessed the
team, and from the platform built in the front of the cask took fodder for the horses, then
tossed upon the grass a bag of meal, a piece of bacon, and a frying-pan. The boy collected
the dry wood with which the earth was strewn, then struck flint and steel, guarded the spark
within the tinder, fanned the flame, and with a sigh of satisfaction stood back from the leaping
fire. His father tossed him a bucket, and with it swinging from his hand, he made through the
wood towards a music of water. Goldenrod and farewell-summer and the red plumes of the sumach
lined his path, while far overhead the hickories and maples reared a fretted, red-gold roof.
Underfoot were moss and coloured leaves, and to the right and left the squirrels watched him
with bright eyes. He found the stream where it rippled between banks of fern and mint. As he
knelt to fill the pail, the red haw and the purple ironweed met above his head.

Below him was a little mirror-like pool, and it gave him back himself with such distinctness
that, startled, he dropped the pail, and bending nearer, began to study the image in the water.
Back in Albemarle, in his dead mother's room, there hung a looking-glass, but it was cracked
and blurred, and he seldom gazed within it. This chance mirror of the woods was more to the
purpose. The moments slipped away while he studied the stranger and familiar in the pool below
him. The image was not formed or coloured like young Narcissus, of whom he had never heard,
but he observed it with interest. He was fourteen, and old for his years. The eyes reflected
in the stream were brooding, the mouth had lost its boyish curves, the sanguine cheek was thin,
the jaw settling square. His imagination, slow to quicken, had, when aroused, quite a wizard
might. He sank deeper amid the ironweed, forgot his errand, and began to dream. He was the
son of a tobacco-roller, untaught and unfriended, but he dreamed like a king. His imagination
began to paint without hands images of power upon a blank and mighty wall, and it painted like
a young Michael Angelo. It used the colours of immaturity, but it conceived with strength.
"When I am a man--" he said aloud; and again, "When I am a man--" The eyes in the pool looked
at him yearningly; the leaves from the golden hickories fell upon the water and hid him from
himself. In the distance a fox barked, and Gideon Rand's deep voice came rolling through the
wood: "Lewis! Lewis!"

The boy dipped the pail, lifted it brimming, and rose from his knees. As he did so, a man parted
the bushes on the far side of the stream, glanced at the mossed and slippery stones rising
from its bed, then with a light and steady foot crossed to the boy's side. He was a young man,
wearing a fringed hunting-shirt and leggins and a coonskin cap, and carrying a long musket.
Over his shoulder was slung a wild turkey, and at his heels came a hound. He smiled, showing
very white teeth, and drew forward his bronze trophy.

"Supper," he said briefly.

The boy nodded. "I heard your gun. I've made a fire yonder beneath a black gum. Adam Gaudylock,
I am well-nigh a man!"

"So you be, so you be," answered the other; "well-nigh a man."

The boy beat the air with a branch of sumach. "I want to be a man! But I don't want to be a
tobacco-roller like my father, nor--"

"Nor a hunter like me," the other finished placidly. "Be the Governor of Virginia, then, or
come with me and make yourself King of the Mississippi! I've watched you, boy! You're growing
up ambitious, ambitious as What's-his-name--him that you read of?"

"Lucifer," answered the boy--"ambitious as Lucifer."

"Well, don't spill the water, my kingling," said the hunter good-naturedly. "Life's not so
strange as is the way folk look at it. You and I, now,--we're different! What I care for is
just every common day as it comes naturally along, with woods in it, and Indians, and an elk
or two at gaze, and a boat to get through the rapids, and a drop of kill-devil rum, and some
shooting, and a petticoat somewhere, and a hand at cards,--just every common day! But you build
your house upon to-morrow. I care for the game, and you care for the prize. Don't go too fast
and far,--I've seen men pass the prize on the road and never know it! Don't you be that kind,
Lewis."

"I won't," said the boy. "But of course one plays to win. After supper, will you tell me about
New Orleans and the Mississippi, and the French and the Spaniards, and the moss that hangs
from the trees, and the oranges that grow like apples? I had rather be king of that country
than Governor of Virginia."

The sun set, and the chill dusk of autumn wrapped the yellow sedge, the dusty road, and the
pines upon the horizon. The heavens were high and cold, and the night wind had a message from
the north. But it was warm beneath the gum tree where the fire leaped and roared. In the light
the nearer leaves of the surrounding trees showed in strong relief; beyond that copper fretwork
all was blackness. Out of the dark came the breathing of the horses, fastened near the tobacco-cask,
the croaking of frogs in a marshy place, and all the stealthy, indefinable stir of the forest
at night. At times the wind brought a swirl of dead leaves across the ring of light, an owl
hooted, or one of the sleeping dogs stirred and raised his head, then sank to dreams again.
The tobacco-roller, weary from the long day's travel, wrapped himself in a blanket and slept
in the lee of his thousand pounds of bright leaf, but the boy and the hunter sat late by the fire.

"We crossed that swamp," said Gaudylock, "with the canes rattling above our heads, and a panther
screaming in a cypress tree, and we came to a village of the Chickasaws--"

"In the night-time?"

"In the night-time, and a mockingbird singing like mad from a china tree, and the woods all
level before us like a floor,--no brush at all, just fine grass, with flowers in it like pinks
in a garden. So we smoked the peace pipe with the Chickasaws, and I hung a wampum belt with
fine words, and we went on, the next day, walking over strawberries so thick that our moccasins
were stained red. At noon we overtook a party of boatmen from the Ohio,--tall men they were,
with beards, and dark and dirty as Indians,--and we kept company with them through the country
of the Chickasaws and the Choctaws until we came to a high bluff, and saw the Mississippi before
us, brown and full and marked with drifting trees, and up the river the white houses of Natchez.
There we camped until we made out the flat-boat,--General Wilkinson's boat, all laden with
tobacco and flour and bacon, and just a few Kentucks with muskets,--that the Spaniards at Natchez
had been fools enough to let pass! We hailed that boat, and it came up beneath the cottonwoods,
and I went aboard with the letters from Louisville, and on we went, down the river, past the
great woods and the strange little towns, and the cotton-fields and the sugar-canes, and the
moss hanging like banners from taller trees than this gum, to New Orleans. And there the Intendant
would have laid hands on our cargo and sent every mother's son of us packing, but Miro, that
was governor, stood our friend, being frightened indeed of what Kentucky might do if put to
it! And there, on the levee, we sold that tobacco and flour and bacon; and the tobacco which
we sold at home for shillings and pence, we sold at New Orleans for joes and doubloons. Ay,
ay, and not one picayune of duty did we pay! Ay, and we opened the Mississippi!"

The speaker paused to take from his pouch several leaves of tobacco, and to roll them deftly
into a long cigar. The boy rose to throw more wood upon the fire, then sat again at the trader's
feet, and with his chin in his hand stared into the glowing hollows.

"The West!" said Gaudylock, between slow puffs of smoke. "Kentucky and the Ohio and the Mississippi,
and then Louisiana and all that lies beyond, and Mexico and its gold! Ha! the Mississippi open
from its source--and the Lord in Heaven knows where that may be--to the last levee! and not
a Spaniard to stop a pirogua, and right to trade in every port, and no lingo but plain English,
and Mexico like a ripe apple,--just a touch of the bough, and there's the gold in hand! If
I were a dreamer, I would dream of the West."

"Folk have always dreamed of the West," said the boy. "Sailors and kings, and men with their
fortune to make. I've read about Cortez and Pizarro,--it would be fine to be like that!"

"I thought you wanted to study law."

"I do; but I could be a great soldier, too."

Gaudylock laughed. "You would trap all the creatures in the wood! Well, live long enough, and
you'll hear a drum beat. They're restless, restless, yonder on the rivers! But they'll need
the lawyers, too. Just see what the lawyers did when we fought the British! Mr. Henry and Mr.
Jefferson--"

The boy put forth a sudden hand, gathered to him a pine bough, and with it smote the red coals
of the fire. "Oh!" he cried, "from morn till night my father keeps me in the fields. It's tobacco!
tobacco! tobacco! And I want to go to school--I want to go to school!"

"That's a queer wanting," said the other thoughtfully. "I've wanted fire when I was cold, and
venison when I was hungry, and liquor when I was in company, and money when I was gaming, and
a woman when the moon was shining and I wished to talk,--but I have never wanted to go to school.
A schollard sees a wall every time he raises his head. I like the open."

"There are walls in the forest," answered the boy, "and I do not want to be a tobacco-roller!
I want to study law!"

The hunter laughed. "Ho! A lawyer among the Rands! I reckon you take after your mother's folk!"

The boy looked at him wistfully. "I reckon I do," he assented. "But my name is Rand."

"There are worse folk than the Rands," said the woodsman. "I've never known one to let go,
once he had man or beast by the throat! Silent and holdfast and deadly to anger--that's the
Rands. If Gideon wants tobacco and you want learning, there'll be a tussle!"

"My father's a tyrant!" cried the boy passionately. "If he doesn't keep his hands off me, I'll--I'll
kill him!"

Gaudylock took the cigarro from his lips. "You're too fond of that word," he exclaimed, with
some sternness. "All the wolves that the Rands ever hunted have somehow got into their blood.
Suppose you try a little unlearning? Great lawyers and great men and great conquerors and good
hunters don't kill their fathers, Lewis,--no, nor any other man, excepting always in fair fight."

"I know--I know!" said Lewis. "Of course he's my father. But I never could stand for any one
to get in my way!"

"That's just what the rattlesnake says--and after a while nobody does get in his way. But he
must be a lonely creature."

"Do you think," asked the boy oddly,--"do you think I am really like that,--like a rattlesnake?"

Adam gave his mellow laugh. "No, I don't. I think you are just a poor human. I was always powerfully
fond of you, Lewis,--and I never could abide a rattler! There's the moon, and it's a long march
to-morrow, and folks sit up late in Richmond! Unroll the blankets, and let's to bed."

The boy obeyed, and the two lay down with the fire between them. The man's thoughts went back
to the Mississippi, to cane-brakes and bayous and long levees; and the boy's mind perused the
road before him.

"When I get to Richmond," he suddenly announced, "I am going to find a place where they sell
books. I have a dollar."

The hunter put his hand in his pouch, drew out a shining coin, and tossed it across the fire.
"There's another," he said. "Good Spanish! Buy your Cæsars and your Pompeys, and when you are
a lawyer like Mr. Jefferson, come West--come West!"

Men and beasts slumbered through the autumn night, waked at dawn, and, breakfast eaten, took
again the road. Revolving cask, horses, dogs, and men, they crossed the wet sedge and entered
the pine wood, left that behind and traversed a waste of scrub and vine, low hills, and rain-washed
gullies. Chinquapin bushes edged the road, the polished nut dark in the centre of each open
burr; the persimmon trees showed their fruit, red-gold from the first frosts; the black haw
and cedar overhung the ravines; there was much sassafras, and along the plashy streams the
mint grew thick and pungent-sweet. In the deep and pure blue sky above them, fleecy clouds
went past like galleons in a trade-wind.

The tobacco-roller was a taciturn man, and the boy, his son, never thought of disburdening
his soul to his father. Each had the power to change for the other the aspect of the world,
but they themselves were strangers. Gideon Rand, as he rode, thought of the bright leaf in
the cask, of the Richmond warehouse, and fixed the price in his mind. His mind was in a state
of sober jubilation. His only brother, a lonely, unloved, and avaricious merchant in a small
way, had lately died, and had left him money. The hundred acres upon the Three-Notched Road
that Gideon had tilled for another were in the market. The money would buy the land and the
small, dilapidated house already occupied by the Rands. The purchase was in train, and in its
own fashion Gideon's sluggish nature rejoiced. He was as land-mad as any other Virginian, but
he had neither a lavish hand nor a climbing eye. What he loved was the black earth beneath
the tobacco, and to walk between the rows and feel the thick leaves. For him it sufficed to
rise at dawn and spend the day in the fields overseeing the hands, to come home at dusk to
a supper of corn bread and bacon, to go to bed within the hour and sleep without a dream until
cockcrow, to walk the fields again till dusk and supper-time. Church on Sunday, Charlottesville
on Court Days, Richmond once a year, varied the monotony. The one passion, the one softness,
showed in his love for horses. He broke the colts for half the county; there was no horse that
he could not ride, and his great form and coal-black locks were looked for and found at every
race. The mare that he was riding he had bought with his legacy, before he bought the land
on the Three-Notched Road. He was now considering whether he could afford to buy in Richmond
a likely negro to help him and Lewis in the fields. With all the stubbornness of a dull mind,
he meant to keep Lewis in the fields. Long ago, when he was a handsome young giant, he had
married above him. His wife was a beautiful and spirited woman, and when she married the son
of her father's tenant, it was with every intention of raising him to her own level in life.
But he was the stronger, and he dragged her down to his. As her beauty faded and her wit grew
biting, he learned to hate her, and to hate learning because she had it, and the refinements
of life because she practised them, and law because she came of a family of lawyers. She was
dead and he was glad of it,--and now her son was always at a book, and wanted to be a lawyer!
"I'll see him a slave-driver first!" said Gideon Rand to himself, and flecked his whip.

On the other side of the cask Adam Gaudylock whistled along the road. He, too, had business
in Richmond, and problems not a few to solve, but as he was a man who never sacrificed the
present to the past, and rarely to the future, he alone of the three really drank the wine
of the morning air, saw how blue was the sky, and admired the crimson trailers that the dewberry
spread across the road. When his gaze followed the floating down from a milkweed pod, or marked
the scurry of a chipmunk at a white oak's root, or dwelt upon the fox-grape's swinging curtain,
he would have said, if questioned, that life in the woods and in an Indian country taught a
man the use of his eyes. "Love of Nature" was a phrase at which he would have looked blank,
and a talisman which he did not know he possessed, and it may be doubted if he could have defined
the word "Romance." He whistled as he rode, and presently, the sun rising higher and the clear
wind blowing with force, he began to sing,--

     "From the Walnut Hills to the Silver Lake,
                 Row, boatmen, row!
     Danger in the levee, danger in the brake,
                 Row, boatmen, row!
     Yellow water rising, Indians on the shore!"

Lewis Rand, perched upon the platform before the cask, his feet dangling, his head thrown back
against the wood, and his eyes upon the floating clouds, pursued inwardly and with a swelling
heart the oft-broken, oft-renewed argument with his father. "I do not want to go to the fields.
I want to go to school. Every chance I've had, I've learned, and I want to learn more and more.
I do not want to be like you, nor your father, nor his father, and I do not want to be like
Adam Gaudylock. I want to be like my mother's folk. You've no right to keep me planting and
suckering and cutting and firing and planting again, as though I were a negro! Negroes don't
care, but I care! I'm not your slave. Tobacco! I hate the sight of it, and the smell of it!
There's too much tobacco raised in Virginia. You fought the old King because he was a tyrant,
but you would make me spend my life in the tobacco-field! You are a tyrant, too. I'm to be
a man just as you're a man. You went your way; well, I'm going mine! I'm going to be a lawyer,
like--like Ludwell Cary at Greenwood. I'm not afraid of your horse-whip. Strike, and be damned
to you! You can break every colt in the country, but you can't break me! I've seen you strike
my mother, too!"

     "Way down in New Orleans,
       Beneath an orange tree,
     Beside the lapping water,
       Upon the old levee,
     A-laughing in the moonlight,
       There sits the girl for me!"

sang Gaudylock.

     "She's sweeter than the jasmine,
       Her name it is Delphine."

The day wore on, the land grew level, and the clearings more frequent. Stretches of stacked
corn appeared like tented plains, brown and silent encampments of the autumn; and tobacco-houses
rose from the fields whence the weed had been cut. Blue smoke hung in wreaths above the high
roofs, for it was firing-time. Now and then they saw, far back from the road and shaded by
noble trees, dwelling-houses of brick or wood. Behind the larger sort of these appeared barns
and stables and negro quarters, all very cheerful in the sunny October weather. Once they passed
a schoolhouse and a church, and twice they halted at cross-road taverns. The road was no longer
solitary. Other slow-rolling casks of tobacco with retinue of men and boys were on their way
to Richmond, and there were white-roofed wagons from the country beyond Staunton. Four strong
horses drew each wagon, manes and tails tied with bright galloon, and harness hung with jingling
bells. Whatever things the mountain folk might trade with were in the wagons,--butter, flour,
and dried meat, skins of deer and bear, hemp, flaxseed, wax, ginseng, and maple sugar. Other
vehicles used the road, growing more numerous as the day wore into the afternoon, and Richmond
was no longer far away. Coach and chaise, curricle and stick-chair, were encountered, and horsemen
were frequent.

In 1790 men spoke when they passed; moreover, Rand and Gaudylock were not entirely unknown.
The giant figure of the one had been seen before upon that road; the other was recognized as
a very able scout, hunter, and Indian trader, restless as quicksilver and daring beyond all
reason. Men hailed the two cheerily, and asked for the news from Albemarle, and from Kentucky
and the Mississippi.

"Mr. Jefferson is coming home," answered Rand; and "Spain is not so black as she is painted,"
said the trader.

"We hear," quoth the gentleman addressed, "that the Kentuckians make good Spanish subjects."

"Then you hear a damned lie," said Gaudylock imperturbably. "The boot's on the other foot.
Ten years from now a Kentuckian may rule in New Orleans."

The gentleman laughed, settled back in his stick-chair, and spoke to his horse. "Mr. Jefferson
is in Richmond," he remarked to Rand, and vanished in a cloud of dust.

The tobacco-cask and its guardians kept on by wood and stream, plantation, tavern, forge, and
mill, now with companions and now upon a lonely road. At last, when the frogs were at vespers,
and the wind had died into an evening stillness, and the last rays of the sun were staining
the autumn foliage a yet deeper red, they came by way of Broad Street into Richmond. The cask
of bright leaf must be deposited at Shockoe Warehouse; this they did, then as the stars were
coming out, they betook themselves to where, at the foot of Church Hill, the Bird in Hand dispensed
refreshment to man and beast.

CHAPTER II

MR. JEFFERSON

By ten of the Capitol clock Gideon Rand had sold his tobacco and deposited the price in a well-filled
wallet. "Eighteen shillings the hundred," he said, with grim satisfaction. "And the casks I
sent by Mocket sold as well! Good leaf, good leaf! Tobacco pays, and learning don't. Put that
in your pipe and smoke it, Lewis Rand!"

Father and son came out from the cool, dark store, upon the unpaved street, and joined Adam
Gaudylock where he lounged beneath a sycamore. Up and down the street were wooden houses, shops
of British merchants, prosperous taverns, and dwelling-houses sunk in shady gardens. An arrow-flight
away brawled the river among bright islands. The sky above the bronze sycamores was very blue,
the air crystal, the sunshine heavenly mild. The street was not crowded. A Quaker in a broad-brimmed
hat went by, and then a pretty girl, and then a minister talking broad Scotch, and then a future
chief justice who had been to market and had a green basket upon his arm. Gideon drew another
breath of satisfaction. "I've been thinking this long time of buying a negro, and now I can
do it! Mocket says there's a likely man for sale down by the market. Lewis, you go straight
to Mocket now, and tell him I'll wait for him there! Are you coming with me, Adam Gaudylock?"

"Why," said Gaudylock, with candour, "I have business presently in Governor Street, and a man
to meet at the Indian Queen. And I think I'll go now with Lewis. Somehow, the woods have spoiled
me for seeing men bought and sold."

"They're black men," said Rand indifferently. "I'll see you, then, at dinner-time, at the Bird
in Hand. I'm going home to-morrow.--Lewis, if you want to, you can look around this morning
with Tom Mocket!" He glanced at his son's flushing face, and, being in high good humour, determined
to give the colt a little rein. "Be off, and spend your dollar! See what sights you can, for
we'll not be in Richmond again for many a day! They say there's a brig in from Barbadoes."

He put up his wallet, and with a nod to Gaudylock strode away in the direction of the market,
but presently halted and turned his head. "Lewis!"

"Yes, father."

"Don't you be buying any more books! You hear me?"

He swung away, and his son stood under the sycamore tree and looked after him with a darkened
face. Gaudylock put a hand upon his shoulder. "Never mind, Lewis! Before we part I'm going
to talk to Gideon." He laughed. "Do you know what the Cherokees call me? They call me Golden-Tongue.
Because, you see, I can persuade them to 'most anything,--always into the war-path, and sometimes
out of it! Gideon may be obstinate, but he can't be as obstinate as an Indian. Now let's go
to Mocket's."

The way to Mocket's lay down a steep hillside, and along the river-bank, under a drift of coloured
leaves, and by the sound of falling water. Mocket dwelt in a small house, in a small green
yard with a broken gate. A red creeper mantled the tiny porch, and lilac bushes, clucked under
by a dozen hens, hedged the grassy yard. As the hunter and Lewis Rand approached, a little
girl, brown and freckled, barefoot and dressed in linsey, sprang up from the stone before the
gate, and began to run towards the house. Her foot caught in a trailing vine, and down she
fell. Adam was beside her at once. "Why, you little partridge!" he exclaimed, and lifted her
to her feet.

"It's Vinie Mocket," said his companion. "Vinie, where's your father?"

"I don't know, thir," answered Vinie. "Tom knows. Tom's down there, at the big ship. I'll tell
him."

She slipped from Gaudylock's clasp and pattered off toward the river, where the brig from Barbadoes
showed hull and masts. The hunter sat down upon the porch step, and drew out his tobacco pouch.
"She's like a partridge," he said.

"She's just Vinie Mocket," answered the boy. "There's a girl who stays sometimes at Mrs. Selden's,
on the Three-Notched Road. She's not freckled, and her eyes are big, and she never goes barefoot.
I reckon it's silk she wears."

"What's her name?" asked the hunter, filling his pipe.

"Jacqueline--Jacqueline Churchill. She lives at Fontenoy."

"Fontenoy's a mighty fine place," remarked Gaudylock.

"And the Churchills are mighty fine people.--Here's the partridge back, with another freckle-face."

"That's Tom Mocket," said Lewis. "If Vinie's a partridge, Tom's a weasel."

The weasel, sandy-haired and freckled, came up the path with long steps. "Hi, Lewis! Father's
gone toward the market looking for your father. That's a brig from the Indies down there, and
the captain's our cousin--ain't he, Vinie? I know who you are, sir. You're Adam Gaudylock,
the great hunter!"

"So I am, so I am!" quoth Adam. "Look here, little partridge, at what I've got in my pouch!"

The partridge busied herself with the beaded thing, and the two boys talked aside. "I've till
dinner time to do what I like in," said Lewis Rand. "Have you got to work?"

"Not unless I want to," Young Mocket answered blissfully. "Father, he don't care! Besides"--he
swelled with pride--"I don't work now at the wharf. I'm at Chancellor Wythe's."

"Chancellor Wythe's! What are you doing there?"

"Helping him. Maybe, by and by, I'll be a lawyer, too."

"Heugh!" said the other. "Do you mean you're reading law?"

"No-o, not just exactly. But I let people in--and I hear what they talk about. I like it better
than the wharf, anyhow. I'll go with you and show you things. Is Mr. Gaudylock coming?"

"No," replied Adam. "I'll finish my pipe, and take a look at the ship down there, and then
I'll meet a friend at the Indian Queen. Be off with you both! Vinie will stay and talk to me."

"Yeth, thir," said Vinie, her brown arm deep in the beaded pouch.

The two lads left behind the scarlet-clad porch, the hunter and Vinie, the little green yard
and the broken gate. "Where first? demanded Tom.

"Where is the best place in Richmond to buy books?"

Young Mocket considered. "There's a shop near the bridge. What do you want with books?"

"I want to read them. We'll go to the bridge first."

Tom hung back. "Don't you want to see the brig from Barbadoes? She's a beauty. There's a schooner
from Baltimore, too, at the Rock Landing. You won't? Then let's go over to Widewilt's Island.
Well, they whipped a man this morning and he's in the pillory now, down by the market. Let's
go look at him.--Pshaw! what's the use of books! Don't you want to see the Guard turn out at
noon, and hear the trumpet blow? Well, come on to the bridge! Nancy, the apple-woman, is there
too."

The shop near the bridge to which they resorted was dark and low, but learning was spread upon
its counter, and a benevolent dragon of knowledge in horn spectacles ran over the wares for
Lewis Rand. "De Jure Maritimo, six shillings eightpence, my lad. Burnet's History and Demosthenes'
Orations, two crowns, Mr. Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a great book and dear!
Common Sense--and that's Tom Paine's, and you may have it for two pistareens."

The boy shook his head. "I want a law-book."

The genie put forth The Principles of Equity, and named the price.

"'Tis too dear."

A gentleman lounging against the counter closed the book into which he had been dipping, and
drew nearer to the would-be purchaser.

"Equity is an expensive commodity, my lad," he said kindly. "How much law have you read?"

"I have read The Law of Virginia," answered the boy. "I borrowed it. I worked a week for Mr.
Douglas, and read The Law of Nations rest-hours. Mrs. Selden, on the Three-Notched Road, gave
me The Federalist. Are you a lawyer, sir?"

The gentleman laughed, and the genie behind the counter laughed. Young Mocket plucked Lewis
Rand by the sleeve, but the latter was intent upon the personage before him and did not heed.

"Yes," said the gentleman, "I am a lawyer. Are you going to be one?"

"I am," said the boy. "Will you tell me what books I ought to buy? I have two dollars."

The other looked at him with keen light eyes. "That amount will not buy you many books," he
said. "You should enter some lawyer's office where you may have access to his library. You
spoke of the Three-Notched Road. Are you from Albemarle?"

"Yes, sir. I am Gideon Rand's son."

"Indeed! Gideon Rand! Then Mary Wayne was your mother?"

"Yes, sir."

"I remember," said the gentleman, "when she married your father. She was a beautiful woman.
I heard of her death while I was in Paris."

The boy's regard, at first solely for the books, had been for some moments transferred to the
gentleman who, it seemed, was a lawyer, and had known his people, and had been to Paris. He
saw a tall man, of a spare and sinewy frame, with red hair, lightly powdered, and keen blue
eyes. Lewis Rand's cheek grew red, and his eyes at once shy and eager. He stammered when he
spoke. "Are you from Albemarle, sir?"

The other smiled, a bright and gracious smile, irradiating his ruddy, freckled face. "I am,"
he said.

"From--from Monticello?"

"From Monticello." The speaker, who loved his home with passion, never uttered its name without
a softening of the voice. "From Monticello," he said again. "There are books enough there,
my lad. Some day you shall ride over from the Three-Notched Road, and I will show you them."

"I will come," said Lewis Rand. The colour deepened in his face and a moisture troubled his
vision. The shop, the littered counter, the guardian of the books, and President Washington's
Secretary of State wavered like the sunbeam at the door.

Jefferson ran his hand over the row of books. "Mr. Smith, give the lad old Coke, yes, and Locke
on Government, and put them to my account.--Where do you go to school?"

The boy swallowed hard, straightened his shoulders, and looked his questioner in the face.
"Nowhere, sir--not now. My father hates learning, and I work in the fields. I am very much
obliged to you for the books,--and had I best buy Blackstone with the two dollars?"

The other smiled. "No, no, not Blackstone. Blackstone's frippery. You've got old Coke. Buy
for yourself some book that shall mean much to you all your life.--Mr. Smith, give him Plutarch's
Lives--Ossian, too. He's rich enough to buy Ossian.--As for law-books, my lad, if you will
come to Monticello, I will lend you what you need. I like your spirit." He looked at his watch.
"I have to dine at the Eagle with the Governor and Mr. Randolph. When do you return to Albemarle?"

"To-morrow, sir."

"Then I may overtake you on the road. Once I did your father a good turn, and I shall be glad
to have a word with him now. He must not keep the son of Mary Wayne in the fields. Some day
I will ride down the Three-Notched Road, and examine you on old Coke. Don't spare study; if
you will be a lawyer, become a good one, not a smatterer. Good-day to you!"

He left the shop. The bookseller gazed after him, then nodded and smiled at the boy. "You look
transfigured, my lad! Well, he's a great man, and he'll be a greater one yet. He's for the
people, and one day the people will be for him! I'll tie up your books--and if you can make
a friend of Mr. Jefferson, you do it!"

Lewis Rand came out into the sunlight with "old Coke" and Locke, Plutarch and Ossian, under
his arm, and in his soul I know not what ardour of hero-worship, what surging resolve and aspiration.
Young Mocket, at his elbow, regarded him with something like awe. "That was Mr. Jefferson,"
he said. "He knows General Washington and Marquis Lafayette and Doctor Franklin. He's just
home from Paris, and they have made him Secretary of State--whatever that is. He wrote the
Declaration of Independence. He's a rich man--he's a lawyer, too. He lives at a place named
Monticello."

"I know," said Lewis Rand, "I've been to Monticello. When I am a man I am going to have a house
like it, with a terrace and white pillars and a library. But I shall have a flower garden like
the one at Fontenoy."

"Ho! your house! Is Fontenoy where Ludwell Cary lives?"

"No; he lives at Greenwood. The Churchills live at Fontenoy.--Now we'll go see the Guard turn
out. Is that the apple-woman yonder? I've a half-a-bit left."

An hour later, having bought the apples, and seen the pillared Capitol, and respectfully considered
the outside of Chancellor Wythe's law office, and having parted until the afternoon with Tom
Mocket, who professed an engagement on the Barbadoes brig, young Lewis Rand betook himself
to the Bird in Hand. There in the bare, not over clean chamber which had been assigned to the
party from Albemarle, he deposited his precious parcel first in the depths of an ancient pair
of saddle-bags, then, thinking better of it, underneath the straw mattress of a small bed.
It was probable, he knew, that even there his father might discover the treasure. What would
follow discovery he knew full Well. The beating he could take; what he wouldn't stand would
be, say, Gideon's flinging the books into the fire. "He shan't, he shan't," said the boy's
hot heart. "If he does, I'll--I'll--"

Through the window came Gaudylock's voice from the porch of the Bird in Hand. "You Stay-at-homes--you
don't know what's in the wilderness! There's good and there's bad, and there's much beside.
It's like the sea--it's uncharted."

Lewis Rand closed the door of the room, and went out upon the shady porch, where he found the
hunter and a lounging wide-eyed knot of listeners to tales of Kentucky and the Mississippi.
The dinner-bell rang. Adam fell pointedly silent, and his audience melted away. The hunter
rose and stretched himself. "There is prime venison for dinner, and a quince tart and good
apple brandy. Ha! I was always glad I was born in Virginia. Here is Gideon swinging down the
hill--Gideon and his negro!"

The tobacco-roller joined them, and with a wave of the hand indicated his purchase of the morning.
This was a tall and strong negro, young, supple, and of a cheerful countenance. Rand was in
high good-humour. "He's a runaway, Mocket says, but I'll cure him of that! He's strong as an
ox and as limber as a snake." Taking the negro's hand in his, he bent the fingers back. "Look
at that! easy as a willow! He'll strip tobacco! His name is Joab."

The namesake of a prince in Israel looked blithely upon his new family. "Yaas, marster," he
said, with candour. "Dat is my name dat sho' is! Jes' Joab. An' I is strong as en ox,--don'
know 'bout de snaik. Marster, is you gwine tek me 'way from Richmond?"

"Albemarle," said the tobacco-roller briefly. "To-morrow morning."

Joab studied the vine above the porch. "Kin I go tell my ole mammy good-bye? She's washin'
yonder in de creek."

Rand nodded, and the negro swung off to where, upon the grassy common sloping to Shockoe Creek,
dark washer-women were spreading clothes. The bell of the Bird in Hand rang again, and the
white men went to dinner.

Following the venison, the tart, and apple brandy came the short, bright afternoon, passed
by Lewis Rand upon the brig from the Indies with Tom Mocket and little Vinie and a wrinkled
skipper who talked of cocoanuts and strange birds and red-handkerchiefed pirates, and spent
by Gideon first in business with the elder Mocket, and then in conversation with Adam Gaudylock.
Lewis, returning at supper-time to the Bird in Hand, found the hunter altered no whit from
his habitual tawny lightness, but his father in a mood that he knew, sullen and silent. "Adam's
been talking to him," thought the boy. "And it's just the same as when Mrs. Selden talks to
him. Let me go--not he!"

In the morning, at six of the clock, the two Rands, the negro Joab, the horses, and the dogs
took the homeward road to Albemarle. Adam Gaudylock was not returning with them; he had trader's
business with the merchants in Main Street, hunter's business with certain cronies at the Indian
Queen, able scout and man-of-information business in Governor Street, and business of his own
upon the elm-shaded walk above the river. Over level autumn fields and up and down the wooded
hills, father and son and the slave travelled briskly toward the west. As the twilight fell,
they came up with three white wagons, Staunton bound, and convoyed by mountaineers. That night
they camped with these men in an expanse of scrub and sassafras, but left them at dawn and
went on toward Albemarle. A day of coloured woods, of infrequent clearings, and of streams
to ford, ended in an evening of cool wind and rosy sky. They descended a hill, halted, and
built their fire in a grassy space beside a river. Joab tethered the horses and made the fire,
and fried the bacon and baked the hoecake. As he worked he sang:--

     "David an' Cephas, an' ole brer Mingo,
     Saul an' Paul, an' de w'ite folk sinners--
           Oh, my chillern, follow de Lawd!"

Supper was eaten in silence. When it was over, Gideon Rand sat with his back against a pine
and smoked his pipe. His son went down to the river and stretched his length upon a mossed
and lichened boulder. The deep water below the stone did not give him back himself as had done
the streamlet five days before. This was a river, marred with eddies and with drifting wood,
and red with the soil. The evening wind was blowing, and the sycamore above him cast its bronze
leaves into the flood which sucked them under, or bore them with it on its way to the larger
river and the ultimate sea. This stream had no babbling voice; its note was low and grave.
Youth and mountain sources forgotten, it hearkened before the time to ocean voices. The boy,
idle upon the lichened stone, listened too, to distant utterances, to the sirens singing beyond
the shadowy cape. The earth soothed him; he lay with half shut eyes, and after the day's hot
communion with old wrongs, he felt a sudden peace. He was at the turn; the brute within him
quiet behind the eternal bars; the savage receding, the man beckoning, the after man watching
from afar. The inner stage was cleared and set for a new act. He had lowered the light, he
had rested, and he had filled the interval with forms and determinations beautiful and vague,
vague as the mists, the sounds, the tossed arms of the Ossian he had dared to open last night,
before his father, by the camp-fire of the mountaineers. In the twilight of his theatre he
rested; a shadowy figure, full of mysteries, full of possibilities, a boy in the grasp of the
man within him, neither boy nor man unlovable, nor wholly unadmirable, both seen, and seeing,
"through a glass darkly."

He turned on his side, and the light went up sharply. A man riding a beautiful and spirited
horse was coming over the hilltop. Horse and rider paused a moment upon the crest, standing
clear against the eastern sky. In the crystal air and the sunset glow they crowned the hill
like a horse and rider nobly done in bronze. A moment thus, then they began to pick their way
down the rocky road. Lewis Rand looked, and started to his feet. That horse had been bred in
Albemarle, and that horseman he had met in Richmond. The boy's heart beat fast and the colour
surged to his cheek. There was little, since the hour in the bookshop, that he would not have
done or suffered for the approaching figure. All along the road from Richmond his imagination
had conjured up a score of fantastic instances, in each of which he had rescued, or died for,
or had in some impossibly romantic and magnificent fashion been the benefactor of the man who
was drawing near to the river and camp-fire. As superbly generous as any other youth, he was,
at present, in his progress through life, in the land of shrines. He must have his idol, must
worship and follow after some visible hero, some older, higher, stronger, more subtle-fine
and far-ahead adventurer. Heretofore, in his limited world, Adam Gaudylock had seemed nearest
the gates of escape. But Adam, he thought, was of the woods and the earth, even as his father
was, and as the tobacco was, and as he himself was. His enormous need was for some one to follow
whose feet were above the fat, red fields and the leafy trails. All this was present with him
as he watched the oncoming figure. Great men kept their word. Had not Mr. Jefferson said that
he would overtake them?--and there he was! He was coming down to the camp-fire, he was going
to stop and talk to the surly giant, like Giant Despair, who sat and smoked beside it.

Lewis Rand left the river and the windy sycamore and hastened across the sere grass. "Father,
father!" he cried. "Do you know who that is?" In his young voice there was both warning and
appeal. Adam Gaudylock, he knew, had spoken to his father, but Gideon had given no sign. Suppose,
no matter who spoke, his father would give, forever, no other sign than that oft seen and always
hated jerk of the head toward the tobacco-fields?

Gideon Rand took his pipe from his lips. "It's Mr. Jefferson," he answered laconically. "He's
the one man in this country to whom I'd listen."

Jefferson rode up to the group about the camp-fire, checked his horse, and gave the tobacco-roller
and his son a plain man's greeting to plain men. The eagerness of the boy's face did not escape
him; when he dismounted, flung the reins of Wildair to his groom, and crossed the bit of turf
to the fire beneath the pines, he knew that he was pleasing a young heart. He loved youth,
and to the young he was always nobly kind.

"Good-evening, Mr. Rand," he said. "You are homeward bound, as I am. It is good to see Albemarle
faces after years of the French. I had the pleasure of making your son's acquaintance yesterday.
It is a great thing to be the father of a son, for so one ceases to be a loose end and becomes
a link in the great chain. Your son, I think, will do you honour. And, man to man, you must
pay him in the same coin. We on a lower rung of the ladder must keep our hands from the ankles
of the climbers above us! Make room for me on that log, my lad! Your father and I will talk
awhile."

Thus it was that an able lawyer took up the case of young Lewis Rand. It was the lawyer's pleasure
to give aid to youth, and to mould the mind of youth. He had many protégés, to all of whom
he was invariably kind, invariably generous. The only return he exacted was that of homage.
The yoke was not heavy, for, after all, the homage was to Ideas, to large, sagacious, and far-reaching
Thought. It was in the year 1790 that he broke Gideon Rand's resistance to his son's devotion
to other gods than those of the Rands. The year that followed that evening on the Albemarle
road found Lewis Rand reading law in an office in Charlottesville. A few more years, and he
was called to the bar; a little longer, and his name began to be an oft-spoken one in his native
county, and not unknown throughout Virginia.

CHAPTER III

FONTENOY

In the springtime of the year 1804 the spectacle of human conduct ranged from grave to gay,
from gay to grave again much as it had done in any other springtime of any other year. In France
the consular chrysalis was about to develop imperial wings. The British Lion and the Russian
Bear were cheek by jowl, and every Englishman turned his spyglass toward Boulogne, where was
gathered Buonaparte's army of invasion. In the New World Spanish troops were reluctantly withdrawing
from the vast territory sold by a Corsican to a Virginian, while to the eastward of that movement
seventeen of the United States of America pursued the uneven tenor of their way. Washington
had been dead five years. Alexander Hamilton was yet the leading spirit of the Federalist party,
while Thomas Jefferson was the idol of the Democrat-Republicans.

In the sovereign State of Virginia politics was the staple of conversation as tobacco was the
staple of trade. Party feeling ran high. The President of the Union was a Virginian and a Republican;
the Chief Justice was a Virginian and a Federalist. Old friends looked askance, or crossed
the road to avoid a meeting, and hot bloods went a-duelling. The note of the time was Ambition;
the noun most in use the name of Napoleon Buonaparte. It seemed written across the firmament;
to some in letters of light and to others in hell fire. With that sign in the skies, men might
shudder and turn to a private hearth, or they might give loosest rein to desire for Fame. In
the columns of the newspapers, above the name of every Roman patriot, each party found voice.
From a lurid background of Moreau's conspiracy and d'Enghien's death, of a moribund English
King and Premier, of Hayti aflame, and Tripoli insolent, they thundered, like Cassandra, of
home woes. To the Federalist, reverencing the dead Washington, still looking for leadership
to Hamilton, now so near that fatal Field of Honour, unconsciously nourishing love for that
mother country from which he had righteously torn himself, the name of Democrat-Republican
and all that it implied was a stench in the nostrils. On the other hand, the lover of Jefferson,
the believer in the French Revolution and that rider of the whirlwind whom it had bred, the
far-sighted iconoclast, and the poor bawler for simplicity and red breeches, all found the
Federalist a mete burnished fly in the country's pot of ointment. Nowhere might be found a
man so sober or so dull as to cry, "A plague o' both your houses!"

In the county of Albemarle April was blending with May. The days were soft and sunshiny, apt
to be broken by a hurry of clouds, of slanting trees, and silver rain. When the sun came out
again, it painted a great bow in the heavens. Beneath that bright token bloomed a thousand
orchards; and the wheat and the young corn waved in the wet breeze. The land was rolling and
red in colour, with beautiful trees and narrow rivers. Eastward it descended to misty plains,
westward the mountains rose, bounding a noble landscape of field and forest. For many years
the axe had swung and trees had fallen, but the forest yet descended to the narrow roads, observed
itself in winding streams, gloomed upon the sunlit clearings where negroes sang as they tilled
the soil. In the all-surrounding green the plantations showed like intaglios. From pleasant
hillsides, shady groves, and hamlets of offices and quarters, the sedate red-brick, white-porticoed
"great houses" looked easily forth upon a world which interested them mightily.

Upon a morning in late April of the year 1804, the early sunshine, overflowing such a plantation,
dipped at last into a hollow halfway between the house and the lower gates, and overtook two
young creatures playing at make-believe, their drama of the moment being that of the runaway
servant.

"Oh, the sun!" wailed Deb. "We can't pretend it's dark any longer! God has gone and made another
day! We'll see you running away,--all of us white folk, and the overseer and Mammy Chloe! If
you climb this willow, the dogs will tree you like they did Aunt Dinah's Jim! Lie down and
I'll cover you with leaves like the babes in the wood!"

Miranda, a slim black limb of Satan in a blue cotton gown, flung herself with promptitude upon
the ground. "Heap de beech leaves an' de oak leaves upon dis heah po' los' niggah. Oh, my lan'!
don' you heah 'um comin'?"

Dead leaves fell upon her in a shower, and her accomplice gathered more with frantic haste.
"Oh, it's the ghost in the tobacco-house! it's a rock rolling down the mountain! it's--it's
something splashing in the swamp!"

"Is I a-hidin' in de swamp? Den don' th'ow no oak leaves on dis niggah, for dey don' grow dyar.
Gawd A'moughty, lis'en to de river roarin'! I's hidin' by de river--I's hidin' by de river!
I's hidin' by de river Jordan!"

Deb swayed to and fro, beating her hands in her excitement. "I see a boat--a great big boat!
It's as big as the Ark! The finders are in it, and the dogs and the guns! Let us pray! O Jesus,
save Miranda, even though it is a scarlet sin to run away! O Jesus, don't let them take her
to the Court House! O Jesus, let them take me--"

Miranda reared herself from her leafy bed. "Humph! what you gwine do at de Co'te House? Answer
me dat! I knows what de Lawd gwine say. He gwine say, 'Run for it, niggah!' Yaas, Lawd, I sholy
gwine do what you say--I gwine run to de very aidge of de yearth.

     "Oh, I fool you, Mister Oberseer Man!
     Oh, I fool you, my ole Marster!
     Cotch de mockin'bird co'tin' in de locus',
     Cotch de bullfrog gruntin' in de ma'sh,
     Cotch de black snake trabellin' 'long his road,
     But you ain' gwine see dis niggah enny mo'!

"Miss Deb, ef I gets to de big gate fust, you gwine lemme hol' dat doll baby Marse Edward gin you?"

Deb brushed the last oak leaf from the skirt of her green gown, tossed her yellow hair out
of her brown eyes, and scrambled up the steep side of the dell to a level of lawn and flowers.
Her handmaiden followed her, and they paused for breath beneath the white blooms of a mighty
catalpa. A hundred yards away, across an expanse of dewy turf, rose the great house, bathed
in sunlight. Box, syringa, and honeysuckle environed it, and a row of poplars made a background
of living green. It had tall white pillars, and shallow steps leading down to a gravelled drive.
The drive was over-arched by elm and locust, and between the trees was planted purple lilac.
All of fresh and fair and tender met in the late April weather, in the bright and song-filled
morning, in the dew and in the flowers. Upon the steps, between the white pillars, were gathered
several muslined figures, flowery bright to match the morning. In the drive below, two horsemen,
booted and spurred, clad in many-caped riding-coats and attended by a negro groom, were in
the act of lifting tall hats to the ladies of the house they were quitting.

"Hi!" panted Miranda. "Marse Ludwell Cary, Marse Fairfax Cary, an' dat brack niggah Eli! Whar
dey gwine dis mawnin'?"

"To the Court House--to the election," answered Deb. "I know all about it, for I asked Uncle
Edward. If the Federalists win, the crops will be good, and General Washington and my father
and my grandfather will lie quiet in their graves. We are Federalists. If the Republicans win,
the country will go to the devil."

"Hi, dat so?" said Miranda. "Le's run open de big gate. Dey two gent'men moughty free wid dey
money."

Racing over the jewelled turf, mistress and maid arrived at the big gate in time to swing it
open before the approaching riders. Young Fairfax Cary laughed and tossed a coin to Miranda,
who bobbed and showed her teeth, while his elder brother stooped gallantly to the pretty child
of the house he was leaving. "Do you know what you are like in your narrow green gown and your
blowing, yellow hair? You are like a daffodil in your sister's garden."

"If you were to swing me up from the ground," said Deb meditatively, "I could stand upon the
toe of your boot, and hold by Pluto's mane, and ride with you as far as the creek.--What flower
is Jacqueline like?"

"Like no flower that blooms," said Mr. Ludwell Cary. "Ah, well sprung, Proserpina! Now shall
we go fast as the wind?"

They went fast as the wind to the creek, and then went like the wind back to the gate, where
Ludwell Cary swung the child down to earth and the waiting Miranda.

Deb curtsied to him. "Wish me good luck, Daffy-down-Dilly!" he said, with his charming smile.

"I do," she answered earnestly. "I hope that you will kill the Devil."

He looked puzzled. "Is that feasible? I don't know where to find him."

"Aren't you going to fight him at the Court House? Uncle Edward said that you were going to
put down Lucifer."

The two brothers broke into laughter. "I say, Fair!" cried the elder. "Has Lewis Rand a cloven
hoof? I've scarcely seen him, you know, since I went to England!"

"He's all cloven hoof, damn him!" the other answered cheerfully. "Best ride on. He'll have
been at the Court House this hour!"

Ludwell Cary glanced at his watch. "Early or late, the result will be the same. The county's
going for him twice over!"

"A damned tobacco-roller's son!" growled the other.

The elder brother laughed. "'A man's a man for a' that,' Fair. I dare say old Gideon rolled
tobacco with all his might. As for his son, his worst enemy--and I don't know that I am that--couldn't
deny him courage and energy."

"He's a dangerous man--"

"Most men are who have won by fighting. But I don't think he loves violence. Well, well, I'm
coming! Good-bye, little one!"

Deb curtsied and Miranda bobbed, the gentlemen touched their hats, black Eli grinned, the horses
began to canter, and, the leafy road bending sharply, the party for the Court House passed
suddenly from view as though the earth had swallowed them up.

Miranda bent her eyes upon her mistress. "Hit's time you wuz in de schoolroom. An' Lan' o'
Goshen! Jes' look at yo' wet shoes! I reckon Mammy Chloe gwine whup me!"

Deb considered her stockings and slippers. "There's no school to-day. Mr. Drew's going to the
Court House to vote. Uncle Edward says it is the duty of every gentleman to vote against this
damned upstart and the Democrat-Republican party. The damned upstart's other name is Lewis
Rand. I'll ask Jacqueline to beg Mammy Chloe not to whip you. I like wet feet."

The parlour at Fontenoy was large and high and cool, hung with green paper, touched with the
dull gold of old mirrors, of a carved console or two, of oval frames enclosing dim portraits.
Long windows opened to the April breeze, and from above the high mantel a Churchill in lovelocks
and plumed hat looked down upon Jacqueline seated at her harp. She was playing Water parted
from the Sea, playing it dreamily, with an absent mind. Deb, hearing the music from the hall,
came and stood beside her sister. They were orphans, dwelling with an uncle.

"Jacqueline," said the child, "do you believe in the Devil?"

Jacqueline played on, but turned a lovely face upon her sister. "I don't know, honey," she
said. "I suppose we must, but I had rather not."

"Uncle Edward doesn't. He says 'What the Devil!' but he doesn't believe in the Devil. Then
why do he and Uncle Dick call Mr. Lewis Rand the Devil?"

Jacqueline's hands left the strings. "They neither say nor mean that, Deb. Uncle Dick and Uncle
Edward are Federalists. They do not like Republicans, nor Mr. Jefferson, nor Mr. Jefferson's
friends. Mr. Lewis Rand is Mr. Jefferson's friend, and he is his party's candidate for the
General Assembly, and so they do not like him. But they do not call him such names as that."

"Mr. Ludwell Cary doesn't like him either," said Deb. "Why, Jacqueline?"

"Mr. Ludwell Cary is his political opponent."

"And Mr. Fairfax Cary called him a damned tobacco-roller's son."

Jacqueline reddened. "Mr. Fairfax Cary might be thankful to have so informed a mind and heart.
It is well to blame a man for his birth!"

"Mr. Ludwell Cary said, 'A man's a man for a' that.' What does that mean, Jacqueline?"

"It means," said Jacqueline, "that--that man stamps the guinea, but God sees the gold."

"Won't you tell me a story?" demanded Deb. "Tell me about the time when you were a little girl
and you used to stay at Cousin Jane Selden's. And about the poor boy who lived on the next
place--and the apple tree and the little stream where you played, and the mockingbird he gave
you. And how his father was a cruel man, and you cried because he had to work so hard all day
in the hot fields. You haven't told me that story for a long time."

"I have forgotten it, Deb."

"Then tell me about summer before last, when you were at Cousin Jane Selden's again, and you
were grown, and you saw the poor boy again--only he was a man--and his father was dead, and
he talked to you in Cousin Jane Selden's flower garden. You never told me that story but once."

"I have forgotten that one too."

"Why does your breath come long like that, Jacqueline? I have gotten my feet wet. Will you
tell Mammy Chloe not to whip Miranda? Here is Uncle Edward!"

Major Edward Churchill entered from the garden, for which he had an attachment almost comparable
to his love for the old Fontenoy library and the Fontenoy stables. He was a gentleman of the
old school, slight, withered, high-nosed and hawk-eyed, dressed with precision and carrying
an empty sleeve. The arm he had lost at Yorktown; a temper too hot to hold he daily lost, but
he had the art to keep his friends. There were duels to his account, as well as a reputation
for great courage and coolness during the late war. Under the name of Horatius he contributed
to The Virginia Federalist diatribes of a polished ferocity against the Democrat-Republicans
and their chief, and he owned Mustapha, the noblest race-horse of the day. He was a bachelor,
a member of the Cincinnati, a Black Cockade, a friend of Alexander Hamilton, a scholar, and
a sceptic; a proud, high, fiery man, who had watched at the death-bed of many things. He made
his home with his brother, the master of Fontenoy; and his niece Jacqueline, the daughter of
a younger, long dead brother, was to him youth, colour, music, and romance.

"The moss-rose is in bloom," he announced, standing in the parlour door. "Come see it, Jacqueline."

They went out into the garden and stood before the moss-rose bush. "Oh, beautiful!" exclaimed
Jacqueline, and touched the rose with her lips. It was sunny in the garden, and the box smelled
strong and sweet. The Major plucked a sprig and studied it as though box were a rarity. "I
have found," he said, "Ludwell Cary's visit highly agreeable. He has come home to Virginia
as likely a man as one could find in a summer day. He adorns the state. I predict for him a
long and successful career."

"Yes, indeed," assented Jacqueline. "I like him very much. How well he talks! And travel has
not made him forget the old days here."

The Major plucked another sprig of box. "In the old days, my dear, your father and your Uncle
Dick and I used to plan--well, well, castles in Spain! castles in Spain! But he's a handsome
fellow!"

"He is indeed," said Jacqueline. "His eyes are especially fine. I like that clear grey--frank
and kind."

"He has sense and principle--he has mind."

"That is evident," answered his niece. "He does everything admirably. Last night after supper
he read to Unity and me. He reads extremely well. The book was the Death of Wallenstein. He
made me see that murder! My heart stood still."

"He is to be admired for standing up to-day against that damned demagogue, Lewis Rand! No matter
if he is defeated. Every gentleman applauds him. You women adore victory, but let me tell you,
a vanquished Federalist is still the conqueror of any ranting Republican!"

"Did I tell you," asked Jacqueline, "that Mr. Pincornet holds the dancing class at Fontenoy
this week?"

"The dancing class be damned! Ludwell Cary is a man and a gentleman, Jacqueline--"

"Yes," said Jacqueline.

The Major threw away his sprig of box. "The Sphinx was a woman, and every woman is an incarnate
riddle! Why don't you care for him, Jacqueline?"

"I do care for him. I like him very much."

"Pshaw!" said the Major irritably. "Don't look at that rose any longer! It's cankered! And
it's time that Dick and I were off. We vote--" he put his shapely, nervous hand upon his niece's
shoulder--"we vote, Jacqueline, for Ludwell Cary."

"Yes, uncle," said Jacqueline. "I know--I know."

Colonel Dick Churchill, large and beaming, and Major Edward Churchill, thin and saturnine,
rode away, and from between the white pillars Deb and Jacqueline watched them go. Colonel Dick's
wife was an invalid, and lay always in the cool and spacious "chamber," between dimity bed
curtains, with her key basket on the counterpane.

"Jacqueline," said Deb, "whom do you vote for?"

"Women do not vote, honey."

"But if you did vote, Jacqueline?"

"Do you remember," asked Jacqueline, "how Lady Mary Wortley Montagu offended Mr. Alexander Pope?"

"Ah," said Deb. "I'm little, and I ask questions, but I'm not crooked! Will Mr. Lewis Rand
ever come to Fontenoy, Jacqueline?"

"You are going to wear your blue gown to the dancing class," said Jacqueline. "Unity is going
to wear her yellow jaconet, and I shall wear white. I will make you a wreath of syringa like
stars. And you may wear your gloves."

"Oh-h!" breathed Deb. "And my cornelian ring--and the flowered scarf--and--and your fan, Jacqueline?"

"Yes," said Jacqueline. "I am tired this morning, Deb. The sunlight is so strong. I think I'll
go darken my room, and lie down upon my bed."

"Does your head ache?"

"Yes, my head," said Jacqueline, and went into the house.

CHAPTER IV

THE TWO CANDIDATES

The town, established forty years before this April morning, had been named for a Princess
of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, lately become Queen of England. During the Revolution it had been
the scene of a raid of Tarleton's and a camp of detention for British prisoners. It was the
county seat to which three successive presidents of the United States must travel to cast their
votes; and somewhat later than the period of this story it was to rub elbows with a great institution
of learning. No city even in our own time, it was, a hundred years ago, slight enough in size
to suit the genius for tempered solitude characteristic of a tobacco-growing State.

A few dwelling-houses of frame and brick rose from an emerald mist of gardens, and there were
taverns, much at the service of all who came to town with money in their purse. The Swan allured
the gentlefolk of the county, the coach-and-four people, Jehus of light curricles, and riders
of blooded horses. The Eagle had the stage-coach patronage, and thrice a week blew a lusty
horn. Besides the inns and the dwelling-houses there were stores and a half-built church, the
Court House, and the shady Court House yard.

For a great part of the time, the Court House, the centre of gravity for the county, appeared
to doze in the sunshine. At stated intervals, however, it awoke, and the drowsy town with it.
Once awake, both became very wide awake indeed. Court days doubled the population; an election
made a beehive of the place.

It was the fourth Wednesday in April, and election day. A man was to be sent to the House of
Delegates at Richmond. All likelihood was upon the side of the candidate of the Democrat-Republicans,
but the Federalists had a fighting chance. There were reasons why this especial election was
of great interest to the county, and the motto of both parties was "No malingering!" Early
in the morning, by the Three-Notched Road, the Barracks Road, and the Secretary's Road, through
the shady Thoroughfare, over the misty Rivanna, the Hardware, and the Rapidan, the county began
to pour electors into Charlottesville. They came upon wheels, on horseback, and afoot; the
strong and the weak, the halt and the blind, the sick and the well, the old and the young,
all the free men of Albemarle, all alert, all pleasurably excited over the prospect of the fight.

Without the Court House yard, under the locust trees to the right of the open gate, were placed
long tables, and on them three mighty punch-bowls, flanked by drinking-cups and guarded by
house servants of venerable appearance and stately manners. Here good Federalists refreshed
themselves. To the left of the gate, upon the trampled grass beneath a mulberry, appeared other
punch-bowls, and in addition a barrel of whiskey, ready broached for all good Democrat-Republicans.
The sunny street was filled with horses, vehicles, and servants; the broad path between the
trees, the turf on either hand, and the Court House steps were crowded with riotous voters.
All ranks of society, all ages, occupations, and opinions, met in the genial weather, beneath
the trees where sang every bird of spring.

Within the Court House the throng, slight at first, was rapidly increasing. The building was
not large, and from end to end, and on the high window-sills beneath the long green blinds,
the people pushed and shoved and stood a-tiptoe. It was yet early morning, and for some unexplained
reason the Federalist candidate had not arrived.

Upon the Justice's Bench, raised high above the crowded floor, sat the candidate of the Democrat-Republicans--the
Republicans, pure and simple, as they were beginning to be called. Near him stood the sheriff
and the deputy-sheriff; around him pressed committee-men, heelers with tallies, vociferous
well-wishers, and prophets of victory, and a few, a very few, personal and private friends.
On the other hand, strongly gathering and impatiently awaiting their candidate, his foes gloomed
upon him. Everywhere was a buzzing of voices: farmers and townspeople voting loudly, the sheriff
as loudly recording each vote, the clerk humming over his book, the crowd making excited comment.
There was no ballot-voting; it was a viva voce matter, and each man knew his fellow's creed.

Lewis Rand sat at ease, a tall and personable man, with the head of a victor, and a face that
had the charm of strength. The eye was keen and dark, the jaw square, the thick brown hair
cut short, as was the Republican fashion. His dress was plain but good, worn with a certain
sober effect, an "it pleases me," that rendered silk and fine ruffles superfluous. He was listening
to a wide-girthed tavern-keeper and old soldier of the Revolution's loud declaration that Lewis
Rand was the coming man, and that he was for Lewis Rand. The old county wanted no English-thinking
young Federalist in Richmond. "Too many Federalists there a'ready! Mr. Lewis Rand, Mr. Sheriff!"

The Republicans applauded. The custom of the time required that the man voted for should thank
the man who voted, and that aloud and aptly, with no slurring acknowledgment of service. Lewis
Rand, a born speaker and familiar with his audience, was at no loss. "I thank you, Mr. Fagg!
May your shadow never grow less! The old county--Mr. Jefferson's county, gentlemen--may be
trusted to hold its own, in Richmond or in Washington, in Heaven or in Hell! Mr. Fagg, I will
drink your health in punch of the Eagle's brewing! Your very obliged friend and servant!"

From street and yard without came a noise of cheering, with cries of "Black Cockade! Black
Cockade! The party of Washington--Washington forever!--The old county for Cary!--Albemarle
for Cary!--The county for a gentleman!"

"Mr. Ludwell Cary has arrived," announced the sheriff.

"Here comes the gentleman!" cried a man from a windowsill. "Stand up, Lewis Rand, and show
him a man!"

The throng at the door parted, and with a Federalist and distinguished following the two Carys
entered, the elder quiet and smiling, the younger flushed, bright-eyed, and anxious. The attachment
between these two brothers was very strong; it was to be seen in every glance that passed between
them, in every tone of voice used by each to the other. The elder played fond Mentor, and the
younger thought his brother a demi-god. They were men of an old name, an old place, an inherited
charm. "Ludwell Cary!" cried a mail. "Long live Ludwell Cary!"

Rand left the Justice's Bench, stepped forward, and greeted his opponent. The two touched hands.
"I trust I see you in health, Mr. Cary?"

"Mr. Rand, I thank you, I am very well. You are early in the lists!"

"I am accustomed to early rising," answered Rand. "This morning I have ridden from the Wolf
Trap. Will you sit?"

"Ah," said Cary, "I rode from Fontenoy. After you, sir!"

They sat down, side by side, upon the Justice's Bench, the Federalist very easy, the Republican,
lacking the perfection of the other's manner, with a stiffness and constraint of which he was
aware and which he hated in himself. He knew himself well enough to know that presently, in
the excitement of the race, the ugly mantle would slip from the braced athlete, but at the
moment he felt his disadvantage. Subtly and slowly, released from some deep, central tarn of
his most secret self, a vapour of distaste and dislike began to darken the cells of clear thought.
As a boy he had admired and envied Ludwell Cary; for his political antagonist, pure and simple,
he had, unlike most around him, often the friendliest feeling; but now, sitting there on the
Justice's Bench, he wondered if he were going to hate Cary. Suddenly an image came out of the
vapour. "How long has he been at Fontenoy? Does he think he can win there, too?"

The younger Cary marched to the polls with his head held high, and voted loudly for his brother.
The latter smiled upon him, and said with simplicity, "Thank you, Fair!" The Republican candidate
looked attentively at the young man. The spirit and the fire, subdued in the elder brother,
was in the younger as visible as lightning. Rand was quick at divining men, and now he thought,
"This man would make a tireless enemy."

Following Fairfax Cary came another of the group who had entered with the Carys. "Mr. Peyton
votes for Mr. Ludwell Cary!" cried the sheriff. The Federalists applauded, the Republicans
groaned, the tallymen took note, and Cary bowed his thanks. "Mr. Peyton, your very humble servant!
Mount Eagle and Greenwood are old comrades-at-arms!"

"I'll kill your vote, Craven Peyton!" came a voice. "I vote, Mr. Sheriff, for Lewis Rand!"

"Ludwell Cary!" cried another, "and there's a killer killed, Dick Carr!"

"I'll draw a bead on you, Gentry!" put in a third. "The best shot in the county, Mr. Sheriff,
and that's Lewis Rand!"

"Lewis Rand stands ten ahead!" cried a committee-man; and the sheriff, "Gentlemen, gentlemen!
order at the polls!"

A small, wizened man, middle-aged and elaborately dressed in much ancient and tarnished finery,
came bowing through the crowd. A curled wig shadowed a narrow face, and lace ruffles fell over
long-fingered hands, yellow as old ivory. The entire figure was fantastic, even a little grotesque,
though after a pleasant fashion. In a mincing voice and with a strong French accent, M. Achille
Pincornet, dancing-master and performer on the violin, intimated that he wished to vote for
Mr. Ludwell Cary. Lewis Rand glanced sharply up, then made a sign to a sandy-haired and freckled
man who, tally in hand, stood near him.

"I challenge that vote!" cried the man with the tally.

"Mr. Pincornet's vote is challenged!" shouted the sheriff.

"Order, order, gentlemen! Your reason, Mr. Mocket?"

"The gentleman is a Frenchman and not a citizen of the United States! He is not even a citizen
of the French Republic! He is an émigré. He has no vote. Mark off his name!"

"Sir!" cried the challenged voter, "I am a de Pincornet, cadet of a house well known in Gascony!
If I left France, I left it to find a great and free country, a country where one gentleman
may serve another!"

A roar of laughter, led by Mocket, arose from the younger and lower sort of Republicans. "But
you do serve, Mr. Pincornet! You teach all the 'Well-born' how to dance!"

"Didn't you teach the Carys? They dance beautifully."

"Are brocaded coats still worn in Gascony?"

"Ne sutor supra crepidam judicaret! Caper all you please on a waxed floor, but leave Virginians
to rule!"

Fairfax Cary, hot and angry, put in an oar. "Mr. Sheriff, Mr. Sheriff! Mr. Pincornet has lived
these twelve years in Albemarle! We have no more respected, no more esteemed citizen. His vote's
as good as any man's--and rather better, I may remark, than that of some men!" He looked pointedly
at Mocket.

Lewis Rand gave his henchman a second guiding glance.

"It is merely," said Mocket promptly, "a question of that Alien Law of which the 'Well-born'
are so proud. Show your papers, Mr. Pincornet. If you are a citizen of the United States, you
have papers to show for it."

"Yes, sir," agreed the sheriff. "That's right, Mr. Mocket. Let me see your papers, Mr. Pincornet."

"Papers, papers! I have no papers!" cried Mr. Pincornet.

"But every gentleman here--and I have no care for the canaille--knows that I live in Albemarle,
in a small house between Greenwood and Fontenoy! I have lived there since I left France in
the abhorred year of '92, with tears of rage in my eyes! I came to this land, where, seeing
that I must eat, and that my dancing was always admired, I said to myself, 'T'enez, Achille,
my friend, we will teach these Virginians to dance!' Mr. Fairfax Cary has been my pupil, and
it gives me pleasure to vote for his brother to go make the laws for my adopted country--"

"I'm sorry, Mr. Pincornet," interrupted the sheriff, "but you have no vote. I'll have to ask
you to stand aside."

"Come up here, Mr. Pincornet," said Cary, from the Justice's Bench. "I want to ask you about
a gentleman of your name whom I had the honour to meet in London--M. le Vicomte de Pincornet,
a very gallant man--"

"That," said the dancing master, "would be my cousin Alexandre. He escaped during the Terror
hidden under a load of hay, his son driving in a blouse and red nightcap. Will Mr. Cary honour
me?" and out came a tortoise-shell snuff-box.

The voting quickened. "Rand is ahead--Rand is winning!" went from mouth to mouth. Fairfax Cary,
caring much where his brother cared little, welcomed impetuously the wave of Federalists which
that rumour brought in from the yard and street. "Ha, Mr. Gilmer, Mr. Carter, you are welcome!
Who votes? Who votes as General Hamilton and Mr. Adams and Judge Marshall vote? Who votes as
Washington would have voted?"

So many crowded to vote as Washington would have voted, that it almost seemed as though his
shade might lead the Federalists to victory. But the dead Washington must cope with the living
Jefferson; mild monarchism and stately rule with a spirit born of time, nursed by Voltaire
and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, grown articulate in the French Revolution, and now full swing toward
majority. When thrown, the Democrat-Republicans rose from the earth like Antæus. Much of the
gentle blood and many of the prominent men of the county voted for Lewis Rand. Jefferson's
personal following of friends and kinsmen was large; these accepted his man as a matter of
course, while to the plain men of the county Lewis Rand was more even than the coming man:
he was of them; he was a plain man. The clamour and excitement grew. "Here come the Three-Notched
Road people!" cried a voice. "They all rolled tobacco with Gideon Rand!"

The Three-Notched Road people voted to a man for the son of Gideon Rand, and were promptly
reinforced by a contingent of hot Republicans from the Ragged Mountains. At ten o'clock Lewis
Rand was again well ahead, but at this hour there was a sharp rally of the Federalists. A cheering
from without announced the arrival of some popular voter, and Colonel Churchill and his brother,
Major Edward, and an array of Federalists from the Fontenoy district, entered the Court House.

"The Churchills are coming, Oho! Oho!" sang out a wag perched on the window-sill.

"Not to that tune," roared a Scot from the gallery. "Mon, they're Tories!"

"Gentlemen, gentlemen! order at the polls!" shouted the sheriff. "Colonel Churchill, for whom
do you vote?"

"I vote, sir," cried the Colonel, "for Mr. Ludwell Cary, for a gentleman and a patriot, sir,
and may the old county never be represented but by such!"

"Order, order at the polls! Colonel Churchill votes for Mr. Ludwell Cary! Major Edward Churchill,
whom do you vote for?"

"For whom do you suppose, Mr. Sheriff?" said the Major. "For Mr. Ludwell Cary."

Cary rose from the bench and stepped forward to the edge of the platform. "Colonel Dick, Major
Edward, I thank you both. May I deserve your confidence and your favour! Fontenoy is as dear
to me as Greenwood."

"By God, you shall win, Ludwell!" cried Colonel Dick. "Here's a regiment of us to see you through!"

"Rome hasn't fallen yet," added Major Edward. "I don't hear the geese cackling."

"One's cackling now," smiled Cary, and Mr. Tom Mocket stepped up to the polls.

"It's not a goose; it's a turkey buzzard!"

"It's not feathered at all," said Fairfax Cary. "It's a mangy jackal to a mangy lion."

The young man had spoken loudly and contemptuously. Rand, on the Justice's Bench, and Mocket,
in the act of voting, both heard, and both looked his way. Ludwell Cary knit his brows, and
meeting his brother's eyes, slightly shook his head. Look and gesture said, "Leave abuse alone,
Fair."

Mocket voted for Rand. "I challenge that vote!" cried Major Edward Churchill. "The man's been
in prison."

Amid the noise that followed, the Jackal was heard to cry, "It's a lie! Lewis, tell them it's
a lie! Major Churchill, you'd better be careful! I was acquitted, and you know it."

"Do I?" answered the Major coolly. "I know that you ought to be making shoes in the penitentiary!
Mr. Sheriff, you should really have this courtroom sprinkled with vinegar. There's gaol fever
in the air."

"I don't see, Mr. Sheriff," came Rand's voice from the Justice's Bench, "that any more vinegar
is needed. Gentlemen, all--whether Federalist or Republican--I was Mr. Mocket's lawyer in the
case referred to. Twelve good men and true--men of this county--pronounced him innocent. It
is not surprising that my friends the Federalists should wish to gain time,--they are leagued
with old Time,--but I protest against their gaining it by such means. This is not a matter
of parties; it is a matter of a man being held innocent till he is proved guilty. A hundred
men here can testify as to the verdict in this case. Mr. Mocket, gentlemen--" He paused and
regarded the sandy-haired and freckled Tom, the brother of little Vinie, the sometime door-boy
in Chancellor Wythe's law office, with a smile so broadly humorous, humane, and tolerant, that
suddenly the courtroom smiled with him. "Tom Mocket, gentlemen, is a scamp, but he's not a
scoundrel! The election proceeds, Mr. Sheriff."

"I vote for Lewis Rand!" shouted the scamp out of the uproar. "Richmond now, then Washington!
We'll send Lewis Rand as high as he can go!"

"As high as the gallows!" growled Major Edward Churchill.

"Send him," said a voice in the doorway, "out West. Mr. Jefferson gained Louisiana, but 'twill
take a stronger man to gain Mexico. Mexico wants a Buonaparte."

The day wore on with no lessening of heat and clamour. The Court House becoming too full, men
betook themselves to the yard or to the street, where, mounted on chairs or on wagons from
which the horses had been taken, they harangued their fellows. Public speaking came easily
to this race. To-day good liquor and emulation pricked them on, and the spring in the blood.
Under the locusts to the right of the gate Federalists apostrophized Washington, lauded Hamilton,
the Judiciary, and the beauty of the English Constitution, denounced the French, denounced
the Louisiana Purchase, denounced the Man of the People, and his every tool and parasite, and
lifted to the skies the name of Ludwell Cary. To the left of the gate, under the locusts, the
Republicans praised the President of the United States and all his doings, and poured oblation
to Lewis Rand. From side to side of the path there were alarms and incursions. Before noon
there had occurred a number of hand-to-hand fights, one, at least, accompanied by "gouging,"
and a couple of duels had been arranged.

In the courtroom the parties jostled each other at the polls, and the candidates, side by side
upon the Justice's Bench, watched the day go now this way and now that. Their partisans they
must acceptably thank, and they must be quick of wit with their adversaries. Fatigue did not
count, nor hoarseness from much speaking, nor an undercurrent of consciousness that there were,
after all, more parties than two, more principles than those they advocated, more colours than
black and white, more epithets than hero and villain. They must act in their moment, and accept
its excitement. A colour burned in their cheeks, and the hair lay damp upon their foreheads.
They must listen and answer to men saying loudly to their faces and before other men, "I hold
with you, and your mind is brother to my mind"; or saying, "I hold not with you, and you and
your mind are abominable to me! To outer darkness with you both!"

Sometimes they consulted with their committee-men, and sometimes punch was brought, and they
drank with their friends. Occasionally they spoke to each other; when they did this, it was
with extreme courtesy. Cary used the buttoned foil with polished ease. Rand's manner was less
assured; there was something antique and laboured in his determined grasp at the amenities
of the occasion. It was the only heaviness. To the other contest between them he brought an
amazing sureness, a suppleness, power, and audacity beyond praise. He directed his battle,
and at his elbow Tom Mocket, sandy-haired and ferret-eyed, did him yeoman service.

At one o'clock there was an adjournment for dinner. The principal Federalists betook themselves
to the Swan; the principal Republicans to the Eagle. The commonalty ate from the packed baskets
upon the trampled grass of the Court House yard. An hour later, when the polls were reopened,
men returned to them flushed with drink and in the temper for a quarrel, the Republicans boisterous
over a foreseen victory, the Federalists peppery from defeat. In the yard the constable had
to part belligerents, in the courtroom the excitement mounted. The tide was set now for Lewis
Rand. The Federalists watched it with angry eyes; the Republicans greeted with jubilation each
new wave. The defeated found some relief in gibes. "Holoa! here's Citizen Bonhomme--red breeches,
cockade, and Brutus crop!

     "Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!"

"That man ran away from Tarleton!--yes, you did, the very day that Mr. Jefferson--a-hem!--absented
himself from Monticello!"

"Challenge that man--he deserted in the Indian War!

     "November the fourth, in the year ninety-one,
     We had a sore engagement near to Fort Jefferson!"

"Here's a traveller who has seen the mammoth and climbed the Salt Mountain!"

"Here's a tobacco-roller! Hey, my man, don't you miss old friends on the road?"

Under cover of the high words, laughter, and vituperation which made a babel of the courtroom,
Cary spoke to his opponent. "Mr. Rand, do you remember that frosty morning, long ago, when
you and I first met? I came upon you in the woods, and together we gathered chinquapins. Does
it seem long to you since you were a boy?"

"Long enough!" answered Rand. "I remember that day very well."

"We told each other our names, I remember, and what each meant to do in the world. We hardly
foresaw this day." "It is not easy to foresee," said Rand slowly. "If we could, we might--"

"We might foresee our last meeting," smiled Cary, "as we remember our first." He took a glass
of wine from a passing servant and put it to his lips, "To another meeting, in the wood!" he
said, "since I may not quite drink to your victory."

"Ah, my victory!" answered Rand. "When I have it, I don't know that I shall care for it! That's
a handsome youth, your brother--and he has worked for you like a Trojan! I'll drink to your
brother!"

"Here are the Green Spring folk!" cried a voice. "They always vote like gentlemen!"

The Green Spring folk were a squadron, and they voted Cary again within sight of the goal.
A man who had been standing just without the open door rested his long musket against the wall
and advanced to the polls. "Last time I voted here," he said, "'twas for Mr. Jefferson. I reckon
I'll have to vote to-day for Lewis Rand."

A tumult arose. "Adam Gaudylock belongs upon the Mississippi!--He isn't an Albemarle man!--He's
a Kentuck--He's a Louisianian--He's a subject of Jefferson's new kingdom!--Challenged!--He
can't vote in Albemarle!"

The hunter waited for the uproar to cease. "You Federalists are mighty poor shots!" he exclaimed
at last. "You make no account of the wind. I am subject of no man's kingdom. I trade in New
Orleans, and I travel on the great rivers, and I've friends in Kentucky, and I hunt where the
hunting's good, but when I want to vote I come back to my own county where I was born, and
where I grew up among you all, and where I've yet a pretty piece of land between here and the
mountains. I voted here before, and I'll vote here again. The Gaudylocks may wander and wander,
but their home is on the Three-Notched Road, and they vote in Albemarle."

The vote standing, and Adam being followed by a string of hunters, traders, and boatmen, the
Republican candidate was again and finally in advance. The winds blew for him from the four
quarters. In the last golden light of the afternoon there was a strong and sudden muster of
Republicans. From all directions stragglers appeared, voice after voice proclaiming for the
man who, regarded at first as merely a protégé of Jefferson, had come in the last two years
to be regarded for himself. The power in him had ceased to be latent, and friend and foe were
beginning to watch Lewis Rand and his doings with intentness.

As the sun set behind the Ragged Mountains, the polls closed, and the sheriff proclaimed the
election of the Republican candidate.

The Court House was quickly emptied, nor was the Court House yard far behind. The excitement
had spent itself. The result, after all, had been foreknown. It drew on chilly with the April
dusk, and men were eager to be at home, seated at their supper-tables, going over the day with
captured friends and telling the women the news. On wheels, on horseback or afoot, drunk and
sober, north, south, east, and west, they cantered, rolled, and trudged away from the brick
Court House and the trampled grass, and the empty bowls beneath the locust trees.

The defeated candidate and the successful shook hands: Cary quiet and smiling, half dignified
and half nonchalant; Rand with less control and certainty of himself. The one said with perfection
the proper things, the other said them to the best of his ability. Young Fairfax Cary, standing
by, twisting his riding-whip with angry fingers, curled his lip at the self-made man's awkwardness
of phrase. Rand saw the smile, but went on with his speech. Colonel Churchill, who had been
talking with Adam Gaudylock, left the hunter and came up to Cary. "Ludwell, you and Fair are
not going to Greenwood to-night! I have orders from the ladies to bring you back to Fontenoy--alive
or dead!"

"I find myself very much alive, Colonel!" answered Cary. "Thank you, I'll gladly spend the
night at Fontenoy. Fontenoy would draw me, I think, if I were dead!"

"Dick has a middling Madeira," remarked Major Edward. "And after supper Jacqueline shall sing
to us. Good-evening, Mr. Rand!"

"Good-evening to you, Major Churchill," said Rand. "Good-evening, Mr. Cary. Good-evening, gentlemen!"

"Here are Eli and Mingo with the horses," said Fairfax Cary, his back to the Republican. "Let's
away, Ludwell!"

Colonel Churchill laughed. "Fontenoy draws you too, Fairfax? Well, my niece Unity is a pleasing
minx--yes, by gad! Miss Dandridge is a handsome jade! Come away, come away, gentlemen!"

Federalists and Republicans exchanged the stiffest of bows, and the party for Fontenoy mounted
and took the road. The Republicans whom they left behind had a few moments of laughter and
jubilation, and then they also quitted the Court House yard and called to the servants for
the horses.

"You'll spend the night at Edgehill, I hope, Mr. Rand?" cried one. "Mrs. Randolph expects you--she
will wish to write to her father of your day--"

"No, no, come with me!" put in another. "There's all this business to talk over--and I've a
letter to show you from Mr. Madison--"

"Best come to the Eagle!" cried a third. "No end of jolly fellows, and bumpers to next year--"

Rand shook his head. "Thank you, Colonel Randolph--but I am riding to Monticello. Mr. Jefferson
has written for some papers from the library. Burwell will care for me to-night. Present, if
you will, my humble services to Mrs. Randolph and the young ladies. By the same token I cannot
go with you, Mr. Carr, nor to the Eagle, Mr. Jones.--My grateful thanks to you, one and all,
gentlemen! I am a plain man--I can say no more. We will ride together as far as the creek."

The negro Joab brought his horse, a magnificent animal, the gift of Jefferson. He mounted and
the party kept together as far as the creek, where their ways parted. Rand checked his horse,
said good-bye, and watched the gentlemen who had given him their support ride cheerfully away
toward the light of home. He himself was waiting for Adam Gaudylock, who was going with him
to Monticello. After a moment's thought he decided not to wait there beside the creek, but
to turn his horse and leave a message for Tom Mocket at a house which he had passed five minutes
before.

CHAPTER V

MONTICELLO

The house, a low frame one, stood back from the road, in a tangle of old, old flowering shrubs.
Rand drew rein before the broken gate, and a young woman in a linsey gown rose from the porch
step and came down the narrow path toward him. She carried an earthenware pitcher and cup.
"It's water just from the well," she said, "fresh and cool. Won't you have some?"

"Yes, I will," answered Rand. "Vinie, why don't you mend that gate?"

"I don't know, thir," said Vinie. "Tom's always going to."

Rand laughed. "Don't call me 'thir'! Vinie, I'm elected."

Vinie set down her pitcher beside a clump of white phlox and wiped her hands on the skirt of
her linsey dress. "Are you going away to Richmond?" she asked.

"Not until October. When I do I'll go see the little old house you used to live in, Vinie!"

"It's torn down," remarked Vinie soberly. "Here's Tom now, and--and--"

"Adam Gaudylock. Don't you remember Adam?"

The hunter and Tom Mocket came up together. "We beat them! we beat them, hey, Lewis!" grinned
the scamp; and Gaudylock cried, "Why, if here isn't the little partridge again! Don't you want
to see what I've got in my pouch?"

"Yeth, thir," said Vinie.

Rand and his lieutenant talked together in a low voice, Mocket leaning against black Selim's
neck, Rand stooping a little, and with earnestness laying down the law of the case. They talked
for ten minutes, and then Rand gathered up the reins, asked for another cup of water, and with
a friendly "Good-bye, Vinie!" rode off toward Monticello, Adam Gaudylock going with him.

Brother and sister watched the riders down the road until the gathering dark and the shadow
of the trees by the creek hid them from sight. "Just wait long enough and we'll see what we
see," quoth Tom. "Lewis Rand's going to be a great man!"

"How great?" asked Vinie. "Not as great as Mr. Jefferson?"

"I don't know," the scamp answered sturdily. "He might be. One thing's certain, anyhow; he's
not built like Mr. Madison or Mr. Monroe. He'll not be content to travel the President's road
always. He'll have a road all his own." The scamp's imagination, not usually lively, bestirred
itself under the influence of the day, of wine, and the still audible sound of horses' hoofs.
"By George, Vinie! it will be a Roman road, hard, paved, and fit for triumphs! He thinks it
won't, but he's mistaken. He doesn't see himself!"

Vinie took the pitcher from beneath the white phlox. "It's getting dark. Tom, aren't we ever
going to have that gate mended?--He's going away to Richmond in October."

The successful candidate and Adam Gaudylock, followed by Joab on a great bay horse, crossed
Moore's Creek, and took the Monticello road. A red light yet burned in the west, but the trees
were dark along the way, and the hollows filled with shadow. The dew was falling, the evening
dank and charged with perfume.

"I asked you to come with me," said Rand, "because I wanted to talk to some one out of the
old life. Mocket's out of the old life too, he and Vinie. But--" he laughed. "They're afraid
of me. Vinie calls me 'thir.'"

"Well, I'm not afraid of you," Adam said placidly. "No one at home at Monticello?"

"No, but Burwell keeps a room in readiness. I am often there on errands for Mr. Jefferson.
Well, how go matters west of the mountains?"

"Christmas I spent at Louisville," answered Gaudylock, "and then went down the river to New
Orleans. The city's like a hive before swarming. There are more boats at its wharves than buds
on yonder Judas tree. And back from the river the cotton's blooming now."

"Ah!" said Rand, "I should like to see that land! When you have done a thing, Adam, a thing
that you have striven with all your might to do, does it at once seem to you a small thing
to have done? It does to me--tasteless, soulless, and poor, not worth a man's while. Where
lies the land of satisfaction?"

"No," answered Adam, "I don't look at things that way. But then I'm not ambitious. Last year,
in New Orleans, I watched a man gaming. He won a handful of French crowns. 'Ha!' says he, 'they
glittered, but they do not glitter now! Again!'--and this time he won doubloons. 'We'll double
these,' says he, and so they did, and he won. 'This is a small matter,' he said. We'll play
for double-eagles,' and so they did, and he won. 'Haven't you a tract of sugar-canes?' says
he. 'Money's naugh. Let us play for land!' and he won the sugar-canes. 'That girl, that red-lipped
Jeanne of thine, that black eye in the Street of Flowers--I'll play for her! Deal the cards!'
But he never won the girl, and he lost the sugar-canes and the gold."

"A man walks forward, or he walks backward. There's no standing still in this world or the
next. Where were you after New Orleans, before you turned homeward?"

"At Mr. Blennerhassett's island in the Ohio. And that's a pleasant place and a pleasant gentleman--"

"Listen!"

"Aye," answered the other; "I heard it some moments back. Some one is fiddling beyond that
tulip tree."

They were now ascending the mountain, moving between great trees, fanned by a cooler wind than
had blown in the valley. The road turned, showing them a bit of roadside grass, a giant tulip
tree, and a vision of a moon just rising in the east. Upon a log, beneath the tree, appeared
the dim brocade and the curled wig of M. Achille Pincornet, resting in the twilight and solacing
his soul with the air of "Madelon Friquet." Around him sparkled the fireflies, and above were
the thousand gold cups of the tulip tree. His bow achieved a long tremolo; he lowered the violin
from his chin, stood up, and greeted the travellers.

"That was a pretty air, Mr. Pincornet," said Rand. "Why are you on the Monticello road? Your
next dancing class is at Fontenoy."

"And how did you know that, sir?" demanded the Frenchman in his high, thin voice. As he spoke,
he restored his fiddle to its case with great care, then as carefully brushed all leaf and
mould from his faded silken clothes.

"I know--I know," replied Rand. He regarded the figure in dusty finery with a certain envy
of any one who was going to Fontenoy, even as dancing master, even as a man no longer young.
Mr. Pincornet looked, in the twilight, very pinched, very grey, very hungry. "Come on with
me to Monticello," said the young man. "Burwell will give us supper, and find us a couple of
bottles to boot."

"Sir," answered the Frenchman stiffly, but with an inner vision of Monticello cheer, "I would
not vote for you--"

Rand laughed. "I bear no malice, Mr. Pincornet. Opinion's but opinion. I'll cut no traveller's
throat because he likes another road than mine! Come, come! Fish from the river, cakes and
coffee, Mr. Pincornet--and afterwards wine on the terrace!"

The road climbed on. Between the stems of the tall trees, feathered with the green of mid-spring,
the dogwood displayed its stars, and the fringe tree rose like a fountain. Everywhere was the
sound of wind in the leaves. When the riders and the dancing master, who was afoot, reached
the crest of the little mountain, shaven and planed by the hand of man into a fair plateau,
the moon was shining brightly. In the silver light, across the dim lawns, classically simple,
grave, and fair, rose the house that Jefferson had built. The gate clanged behind the party
from Charlottesville, a dog barked, a light flared, voices of negroes were heard, and hurrying
feet from the house quarter. Upon the lawn to the right and left of the mansion were two toy
houses, tiny brick offices used by Jefferson for various matters. The door of one of these
now opened, and Mr. Bacon, the overseer, hastening across the wet grass, greeted Rand and Gaudylock
as they dismounted before the white portico.

"Evening, evening, Mr. Rand! I knew you'd be coming up, so I hurried on afore ye. Cæsar and
Joab, you take the horses round! Glad to see you, Adam; you too, Mr. Pincornet! Well, Mr. Rand,
you spoiled the Egyptians this day! I never saw a finer election! Me and Mr. Fagg were talking
of you. 'His father was a fighter before him,' says Mr. Fagg, says he, 'and he's a fighter,
too, damn him!' says he, 'and we'll send him higher yet. Damn the Federalists!' says he. 'He's
a taller man than Ludwell Cary!'"

"I'm a mighty hungry man, Mr. Bacon," said Rand. "And so is Adam, and so is Mr. Pincornet!
You'll take supper with us, I hope? We'll make Adam Gaudylock tell us stories of Louisiana."

"Thank'ee, Mr. Rand, I will. Your room's all ready, sir, and Burwell shall bring you a julep.
I reckon you're pretty tired. Lord! I'd rather clear a mountain side and then plough it, than
to have to sit there all day on that there Justice's Bench and listen to them Federalists!
They're a lot! And that Fairfax Cary--he's a chip of the old block, he surely is! He'd have
gone through fire to-day to see his brother win. This way, gentlemen! Sally'll have supper
ready in a jiffy. I smell the coffee now. Well, well, Mr. Rand! to think of the way you used
to trudge up here all weathers, snow or storm or hot sun, just for a book--and now you come
riding in on Selim, elected to Richmond, over the heads of the Carys! Life's queer, ain't it?
We'll hear of you at Fontenoy next!"

Rand smiled. "Life's not so queer as that, Mr. Bacon. I wish you might--" he broke off.

"Might what?" asked Bacon.

"Hear of me at Fontenoy," answered Rand, and entered the wide hall as one who was at home there.
"I'll go bathe my face and hands," he said, and turned into the passage that led to the bedrooms.

A tall clock struck the hour, a bell rang cheerfully, and Burwell flung open the dining-room
door. Rand, entering a moment later, found the overseer, the hunter, and the dancing master
awaiting him. With a nod and a "Ha, Burwell!" for the old servant, he took his place at the
table, and he took it like a prince, throwing his tall, vigorous figure into the armchair which
marked the head of the board, seating himself before the other and older men. In the wave of
his hand toward the three remaining places there was a condescension not the less remarkable
that it was entirely unconscious. The life within him was moving with great rapidity. It was
becoming increasingly natural for him to act, simply, without thought, as his inner man bade.
What yesterday was uneasiness, and to-day seemed assurance, was apt by to-morrow to attain
convincingness. It was not that he appeared to value himself too highly. Instead, he made no
attempt at valuation; he went his way like wind or wave. He took the armchair at the head of
the Monticello table with the simplicity of a child, and the bearing of a general who sups
with his officers after a victorious field.

The unfolding of the petal was not missed by his companions. Adam Gaudylock, with a glance,
half shrewd and half affectionate, for the man whom he had known from boyhood, sank into the
opposite seat with a light and happy laugh. It mattered little to Adam where he sat in life,
provided that it was before a window. The overseer, a worthy, plain man, had a thought of old
Gideon Rand, but, remembering in time Mr. Jefferson's high opinion of the man now occupying
his chair, sat down and unfolded his damask napkin with great care. Mr. Pincornet, indeed,
raised his eyebrows and made a backward movement from the table, but at that moment a mulatto
boy appeared with a plate of waffles. The light from the wax candles burned, too, in certain
crimson decanters. "Sit down, sit down, Mr. Pincornet!" said Rand, and the dancing master took
the remaining place.

An hour later Rand pushed back his heavy chair and rose from the table, ending the meal with
as little ceremony as he had used in beginning it. "I shall go write to Mr. Jefferson," he
announced, as the four passed into the hall. "You, Adam, what will you do?"

"First I'll smoke and then I'll sleep," said Adam. The moonlight streamed in upon them through
the open hall door. "I'll smoke outside. That's a southern moon.

     "Kiss me, kiss me, flower o' night!
                  Madelon!
     'Ware the voices, 'ware the light!
                  Madelon!

"Will you smoke with me, Mr. Bacon? I'd like to try the Monticello leaf."

"I have to go to the quarters for a bit," answered the overseer. "There's sickness there. I'll
join you later, Mr. Gaudylock."

He went whistling away. Adam sat down upon the broad steps whitened by the moon, filled his
pipe, struck a spark from his flint and steel, and was presently enveloped in fragrant smoke.
The dancing-master, hesitating somewhat disconsolately in the hall, at last went also into
the moonlight, where he walked slowly up and down upon the terrace, his thin, beruffled hands
clasped behind his old brocaded coat. What with the moonlight and the ancient riches of his
apparel, and a certain lost and straying air, he had the seeming of a phantom from some faint,
bewigged, perfumed, and painted past.

Lewis Rand paused for a moment before the door, and looked out upon the splendid night, then
turned and passed into the library, where he called for candles, and, sitting down at a desk,
began to write. His letter was to the President of the United States, and it was written freely
and boldly. "'Twas thus they did--'twas so I did. We won, and I am glad; they lost, and that
also is to my liking. As the party owes its victory to your name and your power, so I owe my
personal victory to your ancient and continued kindness. May my name be abhorred if ever I
forget it! The Federalists mustered strongly. Mr. Ludwell Cary is extremely 'well born,' and
that younger brother of his is--I know not why, he troubles me. There is a breath of the future
about him, and it breathes cold. Well! I have fought and I have won. 'Let the blast of the
desert come: I shall be renowned in my day!' To-night, you see, I quote Ossian. The moon is
flooding the terrace. Were you here in your loved home, we would talk together. Adam Gaudylock
is with me. Lately he was in Louisiana, and then with a Mr. Blennerhassett upon the Ohio. General
Wilkinson is at New Orleans. The Spaniards are leaving, the French well affected. The mighty
tide of our people has topped the mountains and is descending into those plains of the Mississippi
made ours by your prophetic vision and your seizure of occasion. The First Consul is a madman!
He has sold to us an Empire! Empire! Emperor--Emperor of the West! The sound is stately. You
laugh. We are citizens of a republic. Well! I am content. I aspire no higher. I am not Buonaparte.
Your lilies are budding beneath the windows; the sweet williams are all in bloom. I have little
news for you of town or country--Mrs. Randolph, doubtless, sends you all. Work goes on upon
the church. For me, I worship in the fields with the other beasts of burden or of prey. The
wheat looks well, and there will be this year a great yield of apples. Major Churchill's Mustapha
won at Winchester. Colonel Churchill has cleared a large tract of woods behind Fontenoy and
will use it for tobacco. I rode by his plant bed the other day, and the leaf is prime. I am
a judge of tobacco. They are bitter, the Fontenoy men. Mr. Ludwell Cary will, I suppose, remain
in the county. He is altering and refurnishing Greenwood. I suppose that he will marry. The
rains have been frequent this spring, the roads heavy and the rivers turbid. The stream is
much swollen by my house on the Three-Notched Road. We hear that the feeling grows between
General Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Should the occasion arise, pray commend me to the latter,
whose acquaintance I had the honour to make last year when I visited New York. There, if you
please, is a spirit restless and audacious! The mill on the Rockfish is grinding this spring.
The murder case of which I wrote you will be tried next court day. One Fitch killed one Thomas
Dole in North Garden; knocked at his door one night, called him out, and shot him down. Dole
had thwarted Fitch in some project or other. I am retained by the State, and I mean to hang
Fitch. Adam Gaudylock says there is a region of the Mississippi where the cotton grows taller
than a man's head. We may find our gold of Ophir in that plant. To-night I am a victor. I salute
you, so much oftener than I a victor! But victory is a mirage: this that I thought so fair
is but a piece of the desert; the magnum bonum shines, looms, and beckons still ahead! Had
I been defeated, I believe I should have been in better spirits. Now to the papers which you
desired me to read and comment upon: I find--"

The quill travelled on, conveying to sheet after sheet the opinion upon certain vexed questions
of a very able lawyer. The analysis was keen, the reasoning just, the judgment final, the advice
sound. The years since that determinative hour in the Richmond book-shop had been well harvested.
The paper when he had finished it would have pleased the ideal jurist.

He wrote until the clock struck ten; then folded, sealed, and superscribed his letter, pushed
back the heavy hair from his forehead, and rose from the desk. The long windows opened upon
the terrace, and through them came the moonbeams and the fragrance of the April night--music
too, for Mr. Pincornet was playing the violin. The young man extinguished the candles, and
stepped into the silvery world without the room. Adam Gaudylock had disappeared, and the overseer
was gone to bed. Lights were out in the quarters; the house was as still and white as a mansion
in a fairy tale. Mr. Pincornet was no skilled musician, but the air he played was old and sweet,
and it served the hour. Below their mountain-top lay the misty valleys; to the east the moon-flooded
plains; to the west the far line of the Blue Ridge. The night was cloudless.

Rand stood with his hands upon the balustrade, then walked down the terrace and paused before
the dancing master. "Before he hurt his hand Mr. Jefferson played the violin beautifully,"
he said. "When I was younger, in the days when I tried to do everything that he did, I tried
to learn it too. But I have no music in me."

"It is a solace," answered Mr. Pincornet. "I learned long ago, in the South."

"I like the harp," announced Rand abruptly.

"It is a becoming instrument to a woman," replied Mr. Pincornet, and in a somewhat ghostly
fashion became vivacious. "Ah, a rounded arm, a white hand, the rise and fall of a bosom behind
the gold wires--and the notes like water dropping, sweet, sweet! Ah, I, too, like the harp!"

"I have never heard it but twice," said Rand, and turned again to the balustrade. Below him
lay the vast and shadowy landscape. Here and there showed a light--a pale earth-star shining
from grey hill or vale. Rand looked toward Fontenoy, and he looked wistfully. Behind him the
violin was telling of the springtime; from the garden came the smell of the syringas; the young
man's desire was toward a woman. "Is she playing her harp to-night? is she playing to Ludwell
Cary?"

     "Belle saison de ma jeunesse--
     Beaux jours du printemps!"

sang the violin. A shot sounded near the house. Adam Gaudylock emerged from the shadow of the
locust trees and crossed the moonlit lawn below the terrace. "I've shot that night-hawk. He'll
maraud no more," he said, and passed on toward his quarter for the night.

Rand made a motion as if to follow, then checked himself. It was late, and it had been a day
of strife, but his iron frame felt no fatigue and his mood was one of sombre exaltation. What
was the use of going to bed, of wasting the moonlit hours? He turned to the Frenchman. "Play
me," he commanded, "a conquering air! Play me the Marseillaise!"

Mr. Pincornet started violently. Down came the fiddle from his chin, the bow in his beruffled
hand cut the air with a gesture of angry repudiation. When he was excited he forgot his English,
and he now swore volubly in French; then, recovering himself, stepped back a pace, and regarded
with high dudgeon his host of the night. "Sir," he cried, "before I became a dancing master
I was a French gentleman! I served the King. I will teach you to dance, but--Morbleu!--I will
not play you the Marseillaise!"

"I beg your pardon," said Rand. "I forgot that you could not be a Republican. Well, play me
a fine Royalist air."

"Are you so indifferent?" asked the dancing master, not without a faded scorn. "Royalist or
Republican--either air?"

"Indifferent?" repeated Rand. "I don't know that I am indifferent. Open-minded, perhaps,--though
I don't know that that is calling it rightly. The airs the angels sing, and the thundering
march of the damned through hell--why should I not listen to them both? I don't believe in
hell, nor much in angels, save one, but I like the argument. Mr. Pincornet, I don't want to
sleep. Suppose--suppose you teach me a minuet?"

He laughed as he spoke, but he spoke in earnest. "Knowledge! I want all kinds of knowledge.
I know law, and I know what to do with a jury, and I know tobacco--worse luck!--but I don't
know the little things, the little gracious things that--that make a man liked. If I were a
Federalist, and if I didn't know so much about tobacco, I would go, Mr. Pincornet, to your
dancing class at Fontenoy!" He laughed again. "I can't do that, can I? The Churchills would
all draw their swords. Come! I have little time and few chances to acquire that which I have
longed for always,--the grace of life. Teach me how to enter a drawing-room; how to--how to
dance with a lady!"

His tone, imperious when he demanded the Marseillaise, was now genial, softened to a mellow
persuasiveness. Mr. Pincornet shrugged his shoulders. He had been offended, but he was not
unmagnanimous, and he had a high sense of the importance of his art. He had seen in France
what came of uncultivated law-givers. If a man wanted knowledge, far be it from Achille de
Pincornet to withhold his handful! "You cannot learn in a night," he said, "but I will show
you the steps."

"I can manage a country dance, a reel or Congo," said Rand simply. "I want to know politer things."

They left the terrace, went into the drawing-room, and lit the candles. The floor, rubbed each
morning until it shone, gave back the heart-shaped flames. The slight furniture they pushed
aside. The dancing master tucked his violin under his chin, drew the bow across the strings,
and began the lesson.

The candles burned clear, strains of the minuet de la cour rose and fell in the ample room,
the member from Albemarle and Mr. Pincornet stepped, bent, and postured with the gravity of
Indian sachems. The one moved through the minuet in top-boots and riding-coat, the other taught
in what had been a red brocade. Rand, though tall and largely built, moved with the step and
carriage, light and lithe, of one who has used the woods; the Frenchman had the suppleness
of his profession and of an ancient courtier. Now they bowed one to the other, now each to
an imaginary lady. Mr. Pincornet issued directions in the tone of a general ordering a charge,
his pupil obeyed implicitly. In the silent house, raised high on a mountain-top above a sleeping
world, in the lit room with many open windows, through which poured the fragrance of spring,
they practised until midnight the minuet de la cour. The hour struck; they gravely ceased to
dance, and after five minutes spent in mutual compliments, closed the long windows and put
out the superfluous lights, then said good-night, and, bedroom candle in hand, repaired each
to his own chamber. Rand had risen at dawn, and his day had been a battlefield, but before
he lay down in the dimity-hung, four-post bed he sat long at the window of his small, white,
quiet room. The moon shone brightly; the air was soft and sweet. In the distance a lamb bleated,
then all was still again. The young man rested his chin on his hand, and studied the highest
stars. That day a milestone had been passed. He saw his road stretching far, far before him,
and he saw certain fellow travellers, but the companion whom his heart cried for he could not see.

"Her way and mine are far apart--are far apart. I had better marry Vinie Mocket." He spoke
half aloud and with bitterness, looking from the window toward Fontenoy. Suddenly the water
smarted in his eyes, and he stretched out his arms. "Oh, pardon, love!" he whispered, "I love
but you--and I'll love you to the end!" His fancy dwelt on Fontenoy. It was for him enchanted
land, the sleeping palace, strongly hedged. "But I am not the appointed man," he thought. "I
am a pauper, and no prince. It is Ludwell Cary that goes in and out."

CHAPTER VI

RAND COMES TO FONTENOY

"I never dance but by candlelight," remarked Unity. "A Congo in the heat of the afternoon,
a jig before sunset,--la! I had rather plough by moonlight. As well be a grasshopper in a daisy
field! Elegance by waxlight becomes rusticity in the sunshine,--and of all things I would not
be rustic! Oh, Mr. Cary, I've caught my gown in this rosebush!"

Mr. Fairfax Cary knelt to release the muslin prisoner. "Rusticity becomes you so that if I
were a king, you should dance with me the livelong day. But I'll not grumble if only you'll
dance with me as soon as the candles are lit! Last night you were all for that booby, Ned Hunter!"

"He's no booby," said Miss Dandridge. "He is bashful--though, indeed, I think he is only bashful
in company! We sat on the porch, and he told me the long history of his life."

"Confound his impudence--"

"Oh, it was interesting as--as the Mysteries of Udolpho! You are a long time over that briar,
Mr. Cary. There! thank you! Listen to Mr. Pincornet's fiddle. Scrape, scrape, scrape! The children
are dancing, and Jacqueline is helping them. Jacqueline is always helping some one. But Mr.
Pincornet thinks it is because she is in love with him. He is sorry for her because he rather
prefers me. I am in love with him too. So is Molly Carter, so is Anne Page, and so will be
little Deb as soon as she is old enough. He is fifty, and French, and a dancing master, and
he wears an old, old, lace cravat and a powdered wig! When are we going back to the house,
Mr. Cary?"

"Let us walk a little farther!" pleaded the gentleman. "It is cool and pleasant, with no fuss,
and no Ned Hunter, with the history of his life, confound him! Other men have histories as
well as he! Your gown looks so pretty against the leaves. Let us walk down to the lower gate."

Unity pursed her red lips, and considered the distance with velvety black eyes. "I have on
my dancing shoes,--but perhaps you will help me across the brook!"

"I will," declared Fairfax Cary, and, when the brook was reached, was as good as his word.

"I shall tell Uncle Dick to put safer stepping-stones," quoth Miss Dandridge, with heightened
colour. "How thick the mint grows here! We are at the gate, Mr. Cary."

"Let us walk to the bend of the road! The wild honeysuckle is in bloom there; I noticed it
riding to Charlottesville the other morning. It is just the colour of your gown."

"Then it must be beautiful," said Miss Dandridge, "for this rose-coloured muslin came from
London. Ah, you looked so angry and so beaten on Wednesday, when you came back from Charlottesville!"

"I was not angry, and I was not beaten."

"Fie! You mean that your brother was."

"I mean nothing of the kind!" cried the younger Cary hotly. "My brother, at the importunity
of his friends, and for the good of the county, consented to stand against this pet of Jefferson's,
this--this vaurien Lewis Rand. Some one had to stand. He knew what the result would be. 'Twas
but a skirmish--just a seat in a tri-colour Republican House of Delegates! My faith! the honour's
not great. But wait awhile, Miss Dandridge! The real battle's not yet. Beaten! Rands, Miss
Dandridge, don't beat Carys!"

"La, so warm!" exclaimed Unity. "I have never seen a man love a brother so!"

"Ludwell Cary is worthy of any man's love--or any woman's either!"

"The pair of you ought to be put in the wax-works, and labelled 'The Loving Brothers.' When
you marry, there'll be no love left for your wife."

"Just you try and see."

"The man whom I marry," said Miss Dandridge, "must have no thought but for me. He must swoon
if I frown, laugh if I smile, weep if I sigh, be altogether desperate if I look another way.
I am like Falkland in The Rivals. Heigho! this is the bend of the road, Mr. Cary."

"I am altogether desperate when you look another way. When you looked at Ned Hunter last night,
I wanted to blow his brains out. He hasn't any, but I should like to try."

"Then you would have been hanged for murder," remarked Miss Dandridge. "Think how terrible
that would be for us all!--Did you know that Mr. Hunter once dined with General Washington?"

"You are a royal coquette. See, there is the honeysuckle! If I gather it for you, will you
wear one spray to-night?"

"It is a very stiff flower," said Unity thoughtfully, "and I have an idea that Mr. Hunter will
bring me violets. But--I will see if I can find a place for one small spray."

She sat down upon a fallen tree, took her round chin into her hand, and studied the point of
her morocco shoe, while her cavalier, not without detriment to his pumps and silk stockings,
scrambled up the red bank to the rosy flowers.

The honeysuckles did not grow upon the main road, but upon a rough and narrow cross-country
track, little used except by horsemen pressed for time. Now, clear through the still afternoon,
a sound of hoofs gave warning that riders were coming down the steep and dangerous hill beyond
the turn. Unity looked up with interest, and Fairfax Cary paused with his hand upon a coral
bough. Suddenly there was a change in the beat, then a frightened shout, and a sound of rolling
stones and a wild clatter of hoofs. Unity sprang to her feet; Cary came down the bank at a
run, tossed her his armful of blossoms, and was in the middle of the road in time to seize
by the bridle the riderless horse which came plunging around the bend.

Fairfax Cary was strong, the black horse not quite mad with terror, and the man mastered the
brute. "Whose is he?" he asked. "If you will hold him--he is quite quiet now--I will go see."

A negro came panting around the turn. "Gawd-a-moughty, marster! did you cotch dat horse? You,
Selim, I's gwine lam' you, I's gwine teach you er lesson--dancin' roun' on yo' two foots 'cause
you sees er scrap of paper! R'arin' an' pitchin' an' flingin' white folks on er heap of stones!
I'll larn you! Yo' marster was a-dreamin', or you'd never th'owed him! You jes wait twel I
git you home! Marse Fairfax Cary, dis debbil done th'owed my marster, an' he lyin' by de roadside,
an' I don' know whether he live or daid!"

"I know you now," exclaimed the younger Cary. "You're Mr. Lewis Rand's servant. Hadn't you
better stay here, Miss Dandridge, until I see what really is the matter? Here, boy, stop chattering
your teeth! Your master's not killed. Was it at the top of the hill?"

"Halfway down, Marse Fairfax, whar de footpath goes down through de papaw bushes. Joab'll show
you."

"I'm coming too," said Miss Dandridge. "I'll lead Selim."

Without more ado the four rounded the bend of the road and began to climb the hill. Halfway
up, as Joab had stated, they found their man. He lay beside the papaw bushes, among the loose
stones, and he lay very still. One arm was doubled under him. His head was thrown back, and
his brown hair was matted with blood.

"Oh!" cried Unity pitifully, and went down upon her knees beside the unfortunate.

Cary examined the cut in the head. "Well, he's not dead, but he's had a pretty fall! What's
to be done? Joab--"

"Joab," commanded Miss Dandridge, "ride straight to Fontenoy and tell Colonel Dick to send
Big Jim and a couple of men with the old litter!--and then ride to Charlottesville and bring
Dr. Gilmer--"

"Are you going to take him to Fontenoy?" asked the younger Cary.

"Why not?" flashed Miss Dandridge. "Would you leave him to bleed to death by the roadside?
'My enemy's dog--' and so forth. Hurry, Joab!"

The negro mounted his horse that had been grazing by the papaw bushes, and was off at a gallop,
leaving Unity and Cary with the luckless rider. Cary brought water from the brook that brawled
at the foot of the steep hillside, and Unity wet the brow and lips of the unconscious man,
but he had given no sign of life when the relief party arrived from Fontenoy. This consisted
of four stout negroes bearing the litter, and of Colonel Dick Churchill and Mr. Ned Hunter.

"Tut, tut!" cried Colonel Dick. "What's this? what's this? Damn this place! My mare Nelly threw
me here thirty years ago!--I was coming home from a wedding. Senseless and cut across the head!--and
I don't like the way that arm's bent.--Ned Hunter, you take Big Jim's corner of the litter
for a minute. Now, Big Jim, you lift Mr. Rand.--So! we'll have him at Fontenoy in a jiffy,
and in bed in the blue room. Run ahead, Unity, and tell Jacqueline and Mammy Chloe to make
ready. His boy's gone for Gilmer. Easy now, men! Yes, 'twas at this very spot my mare Nelly
threw me!--it was Maria Erskine's wedding."

The sun was low in the heavens when the good Samaritans and the unconscious man arrived at
the foot of the wide, white-pillared Fontenoy porch. The arrival had many witnesses; for on
hearing of the accident the large party assembled for the dancing class had at once dropped
all employment and flocked to various coigns of vantage. A bevy of young girls looked from
one parlour window, and another framed Mr. Pincornet's face and wig and flowered coat. In the
hall and on the porch the elders gathered, while on the broad porch steps young men in holiday
dress waited to see if they might be of help. Around the corner of the house peered the house
negroes, pleasurably excited by any catastrophe and any procession, even that of a wounded
man borne on a litter.

The cortège arrived. In the midst of much ejaculation, and accompanied by a fire of directions
from Colonel Dick, Lewis Rand was borne up the steps and across the porch into the cool, wide
hail. Here the litter was met by Jacqueline Churchill. She came down the shadowy staircase
in a white gown, with a salver and a glass in her hand. "The room is ready, Uncle Dick," she
said, in a steady voice. "The blue room. Aunt Nancy says you must make him take this cordial.
I have lint and bandages all ready. This way, Big Jim. Mind the wall!"

She turned and preceded the men up the stair, along a hallway and into a pleasant chamber hung
with blue and white. "Turn down the sheet, Mammy Chloe," she directed a negro woman standing
beside the bed. "Quick! quick! he is bleeding so."

Rand was laid upon the bed, and as the men drew their arms from beneath him, he moved his head,
and his lips parted. A moment later he opened his eyes. Colonel Dick heaved a sigh of relief.
"He'll do now! Gilmer shall come and bleed him, and he'll be out again before you can say Jack
Robinson! I'll have that place in the road mended to-morrow. Yes, yes, Mr. Rand, you've had
an accident. Lie still! you're with friends. Hey, what did you say?"

Rand had said nothing articulate. His eyes were upon Jacqueline, standing at the foot of the
bed. The room was in the western wing of the house, and where she stood she was bathed in the
light of the sinking sun. It made her brown hair golden and like a nimbus. Rand made a straying
motion with his hand. "I did not believe in heaven," he muttered. "If I have erred--"

"Lie still, lie still!" said Jacqueline. In a moment she turned, left the room, and went downstairs.
"He is better," she told her cousin Unity, who with Fairfax Cary was waiting in the lower hall;
then went on to the library, opened the door, and closed it softly behind her.

The room was dim, and she thought it vacant. There was an old leather chair which she loved,
which had always stood beside the glass doors that gave upon the sunset, in whose worn depths
she had, as a child, told herself fairy tales, and found escape from childish woes. She went
straight to it now, sank into its old arms, and pressed her cheek against the cool leather.
She closed her eyes, and sat very still, and tried to ease the throbbing of her heart. Some
one coughed, and she looked up to find her Uncle Edward regarding her from his own favourite chair.

"I did not know you were there," she exclaimed. "I thought the room was empty. What are you
reading?"

"A Treatise on Hospitality," answered Major Churchill, with great dryness. "I suppose Dick
is making posset in his best racing cup? How is the interesting patient?"

Jacqueline coloured. "Uncle Dick--"

"Uncle Dick," interrupted the Major, "is the best of fellows, but he is not perspicacious.
I am, and I say again, why the deuce did this damned Republican get himself thrown at our very
gates? In my day a horse might act a little gaily, but a man kept his seat!"

Jacqueline coloured more deeply. "It was that bad place on the hill road. I do not suppose
that Mr. Rand is a poor horseman."

"Who said that he was?" demanded the Major testily. "A poor horseman! He and his old wolf of
a father used to break all the colts for twenty miles round! That place in the road! Pshaw!
I've ridden by that place in the road for forty years, but I never had the indecency to be
brought on a litter into a gentleman's house who was not of my way of thinking! And every man
and woman on the place--barring poor Nancy--out to receive him! I am not at home among fools,
so I came here--though the Lord knows there's many a fool to be found in a library!--Well,
are any bones broken?"

"Dr. Gilmer will tell us--oh, he looked like death!"

"Who?--William Gilmer?" demanded Uncle Edward with asperity. "Your pronoun 'he' stands for
your antecedent 'Gilmer.' But what's the English tongue when we have a Jacobin in the house!
Women like strange animals, and they are vastly fond of pitying. But you were always a home
body, Jacqueline, and left Unity to run after the sea lions and learned pigs! And now you sit
there as white as your gown!"

Jacqueline smiled. "Perhaps I am of those who pity. I hear a horse upon the road! It may be
Dr. Gilmer!" and up she started.

"The horse has gone by," said Uncle Edward. "Gilmer cannot possibly be here for an hour. Sit
down, child, and don't waste your pity. The Rands are used to hard knocks. I've seen old Gideon
in the ring, black and blue and blind with blood, demanding proof that he was beaten. The gentleman
upstairs will take care of himself. Bah!--Where is Ludwell Cary this afternoon?"

"He rode, I think, to Charlottesville."

"You think! Don't you know?--What woman was ever straightforward!"

Major Churchill opened his book, looked at it, and tossed it aside; took The Virginia Federalist
from the table, and for perhaps sixty seconds appeared absorbed in its contents, then with
a loud "Pshaw!" threw it down, and rising walked to a bookcase. "I am reading Swift," he said,
and brought a calf-bound volume to the window. "There was a man who knew hatred and the risus
sardonicus! Listen to this, Jacqueline."

Major Churchill read well, and it was his habit to read aloud to Jacqueline, whose habit it
was to listen. Now she sat before the window, in the old leather chair, her slender face and
form in profile, and her eyes upon the sunset sky. It was her accustomed attitude, and Uncle
Edward read on with growing satisfaction, finding that he was upon a passage which gave Democracy
its due. He turned a page, then another, glanced from the book, and discovered that his niece
was not attending. Indeed, the variety and disparity among the different examples prove
that we have here only the first steps toward the evolution of an
independent order, which it was reserved for the Romans to fully develop.

+GREEK

TEMPLES; THE TYPE.+ With the orders as their chief decorative element the Greeks built up a splendid
architecture of religious and secular monuments. Their noblest works were temples, which they
designed with the utmost simplicity of general scheme, but carried out with a mastery of proportion
and detail which has never been surpassed.

Of moderate size in most cases, they were intended primarily to enshrine the simulacrum of
the deity, and not, like Christian churches, to accommodate great throngs of worshippers. Nor
were they, on the other hand, sanctuaries designed, like those of Egypt, to exclude all but a privileged
few from secret rites performed only by the priests and king. The statue of the deity was enshrined
in a chamber, the naos (see plan, Fig. 31), often of considerable
size, and accessible to the public through a columnar porch the pronaos.

A smaller chamber, the opisthodomus, was sometimes added in the rear of the main sanctuary, to serve
as a treasury or depository for votive offerings. Together these formed a windowless structure
called the cella, beyond which was the rear porch, the posticum or
epinaos.

This whole structure was in the larger temples surrounded by a colonnade,
the peristyle, which formed the most splendid feature of Greek architecture.

The external aisle on either side of the cella was called the pteroma.

A single gabled roof covered the entire building.

The Greek colonnade was thus an exterior feature, surrounding the solid cella-wall instead of
being enclosed by it as in Egypt. The temple was a public, not a royal monument; and its builders aimed,
not as in Egypt at size and overwhelming sombre majesty, but rather at sunny beauty and the highest
perfection of proportion, execution, and detail (Fig. 34).

There were of course many variations of the general type just described. Each of these has
received a special name, which is given below with explanations and is illustrated in Fig. 31.

In
antis; with a porch having two or more columns enclosed between the projecting side-walls of the
cella.

Prostylar (or prostyle); with a columnar porch in front and no peristyle.

Amphiprostylar

(or -style); with columnar porches at both ends but no peristyle.

Peripteral; surrounded by columns.

Pseudoperipteral; with false or engaged columns built into the walls of the cella, leaving
no pteroma.

Dipteral; with double lateral ranges of columns (see Fig. 39).

Pseudodipteral; with a single row of columns on each side, whose distance from the wall is equal
to two intercolumniations of the front.

Tetrastyle, hexastyle, octastyle, decastyle, etc.; with four, six, eight, or ten columns in
the end rows.

+CONSTRUCTION.+ All the temples known to us are of stone, though it is evident from allusions
in the ancient writers that wood was sometimes used in early times. (See p. 62.) The finest
temples, especially those of Attica, Olympia, and Asia Minor, were of marble. In Magna Græcia,
at Assos, and in other places where marble was wanting, limestone, sandstone, or lava was employed
and finished with a thin, fine stucco. The roof was almost invariably of wood and gabled,
forming at the ends pediments decorated in most cases with sculpture.

The disappearance of these inflammable and perishable roofs has given rise to endless speculations
as to the lighting of the cellas, which in all known ruins, except one at Agrigentum, are destitute
of windows. It has been conjectured that light was admitted through openings in the roof, and
even that the central part of the cella was wholly open to the sky. Such an arrangement is
termed hypæthral, from an expression used in a description by Vitruvius;[9]
but this description corresponds to no known structure, and the weight
of opinion now inclines against the use of the hypæthral opening,
except possibly in one or two of the largest temples, in which a part
of the cella in front of the statue may have been thus left open.

But even this partial hypæthros is not substantiated by direct evidence. It hardly seems probable
that the magnificent chryselephantine statues of such temples were ever thus left exposed to the
extremes of the climate, which are often severe even in Greece.

In the model of the Parthenon designed by Ch.

Chipiez for the Metropolitan Museum in New York, a small clerestory
opening through the roof admits a moderate amount of light to the
cella; but this ingenious device rests on no positive evidence (see
Frontispiece).

It seems on the whole most probable that the cella was lighted entirely
by artificial illumination; but the controversy in its present state
is and must be wholly speculative.

[Footnote 9: Lib. III., Cap. I.]

The wooden roof was covered with tiles of terra-cotta or marble. It was probably ceiled and panelled
on the under side, and richly decorated with color and gold. The pteroma had under the exterior
roof a ceiling of stone or marble, deeply panelled between transverse architraves.

The naos and opisthodomus being in the larger temples too wide to be spanned by single beams,
were furnished with interior columns to afford intermediate support. To avoid the extremes
of too great massiveness and excessive slenderness in these columns, they were built in two stages,
and advantage was taken of this arrangement, in some cases, at least, to introduce lateral galleries
into the naos.

+SCULPTURE AND CARVING.+ All the architectural membering was treated with the greatest refinement
of design and execution, and the aid of sculpture, both in relief and in the round, was invoked
to give splendor and significance to the monument.

The statue of the deity was the focus of internal interest, while externally, groups of statues
representing the Olympian deities or the mythical exploits of gods,
demigods, and heroes, adorned the gables.

Relief carvings in the friezes and metopes commemorated the favorite national myths. In these
sculptures we have the finest known adaptations of pure sculpture--i.e., sculpture treated
as such and complete in itself--to an architectural framework. The noblest examples of this decorative
sculpture are those of the Parthenon, consisting of figures in the
full round from the pediments, groups in high relief from the metopes,
and the beautiful frieze of the Panathenaic procession from the cella-wall
under the pteroma ceiling.

The greater part of these splendid works are now in the British Museum,
whither they were removed by Lord Elgin in 1801.

From Olympia, Ægina, and Phigaleia, other master-works of the same kind have been transferred
to the museums of Europe. In the Doric style there was little carving other than the sculpture,
the ornament being mainly polychromatic. Greek Ionic and Corinthian monuments, however, as well
as minor works such as steles, altars, etc., were richly adorned with carved mouldings and friezes,
festoons, acroteria, and other embellishments executed with the chisel. The anthemion ornament,
a form related to the Egyptian lotus and Assyrian palmette, most frequently figures in these. It was
made into designs of wonderful vigor and beauty (Fig. 32).

+DETAIL AND EXECUTION.+ In the handling and cutting of stone the Greeks displayed a surpassing
skill and delicacy. While ordinarily they were content to use stones of moderate size, they never
hesitated at any dimension necessary for proper effect or solid construction. The lower drums of
the Parthenon peristyle are 6 feet 6½ inches in diameter, and 2 feet 10 inches high, cut from
single blocks of Pentelic marble. The architraves of the Propylæa at Athens are each made up of
two lintels placed side by side, the longest 17 feet 7 inches long, 3 feet 10 inches high, and
2 feet 4 inches thick. In the colossal temples of Asia Minor, where the taste for the vast
and grandiose was more pronounced, blocks of much greater size were used. These enormous stones
were cut and fitted with the most scrupulous exactness. The walls of all important structures
were built in regular courses throughout, every stone carefully bedded with extremely close joints.
The masonry was usually laid up without cement and clamped with metal; there is no filling in
with rubble and concrete between mere facings of cut stone, as in most modern work. When the
only available stone was of coarse texture it was finished with a coating of fine stucco,
in which sharp edges and minute detail could be worked.

The details were, in the best period, executed with the most extraordinary refinement and care.
The profiles of capitals and mouldings, the carved ornament, the
arrises of the flutings, were cut with marvellous precision and delicacy.

It has been rightly said that the Greeks “built like Titans and finished
like jewellers.” But this perfect finish was never petty nor wasted
on unworthy or vulgar design.

The just relation of scale between the building and all its parts was admirably maintained;
the ornament was distributed with rare judgment, and the vigor of its design saved it from all
appearance of triviality.

The sensitive taste of the Greeks led them into other refinements
than those of mere mechanical perfection.

In the Parthenon especially, but also in lesser degree in other temples,
the seemingly straight lines of the building were all slightly curved,
and the vertical faces inclined.

This was done to correct the monotony and stiffness of absolutely straight lines and right angles,
and certain optical illusions which their acute observation had detected. The long horizontal lines
of the stylobate and cornice were made convex upward; a similar convexity in the horizontal
corona of the pediment counteracted the seeming concavity otherwise resulting from its meeting
with the multiplied inclined lines of the raking cornice. The columns were almost imperceptibly
inclined toward the cella, and the corner intercolumniations made a trifle narrower than the
rest; while the vertical lines of the arrises of the flutings were made convex outward with
a curve of the utmost beauty and delicacy. By these and other like refinements there was imparted
to the monument an elasticity and vigor of aspect, an elusive and
surprising beauty impossible to describe and not to be explained by
the mere composition and general proportions, yet manifest to every
cultivated eye.[10]

[Footnote 10: These refinements, first noticed
by Allason in 1814, and later confirmed by Cockerell and Haller as
to the columns, were published to the world in 1838 by Hoffer, verified
by Penrose in 1846, and further developed by the investigations of
Ziller and later observers.]

+HISTORIC
DEVELOPMENT.+ The history of Greek architecture, subsequent to the Heroic or Primitive Age, may
be divided into periods as follows:

The ARCHAIC; from 650 to 500
B.C.

The TRANSITIONAL; from 500 to 460 B.C., or to the revival of
prosperity after the Persian wars.

The PERICLEAN; from 460 to 400 B.C.

The FLORID or ALEXANDRIAN; from 400 to 300 B.C.

The DECADENT; 300
to 100 B.C.

The ROMAN; 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.

These dates are, of
course, somewhat arbitrary; it is impossible to set exact bounds to
style-periods, which must inevitably overlap at certain points, but
the dates, as given above, will assist in distinguishing the successive
phases of the history.

+ARCHAIC PERIOD.+ The archaic period is characterized by the exclusive use of the Doric order,
which appears in the earliest monuments complete in all its parts, but heavy in its proportions
and coarse in its execution. The oldest known temples of this period are the +Apollo Temple+
at Corinth (650 B.C.?), and the +Northern Temple+ on the acropolis at +Selinus+ in Sicily (cir. 610-590
B.C.). They are both of a coarse limestone covered with stucco. The columns are low and massive
(4⅓ to 4⅔ diameters in height), widely spaced, and carry a very high entablature. The triglyphs
still appear around the cella wall under the pteroma ceiling, an illogical detail destined to
disappear in later buildings. Other temples at Selinus date from the middle or latter part
of the sixth century; they have higher columns and finer profiles than those just mentioned.
The great +Temple of Zeus+ at +Selinus+ was the earliest of five colossal Greek temples of
very nearly identical dimensions; it measured 360 feet by 167 feet
in plan, but was never completed.

During the second half of the sixth century important Doric temples were built at Pæstum in South Italy,
and Agrigentum in Sicily; the somewhat primitive temple at Assos in Asia Minor, with uncouth
carvings of centaurs and monsters on its architrave, belongs to this same period. The +Temple of
Zeus+ at +Agrigentum+ (Fig. 33) is another singular and exceptional design, and was the second of the
five colossal temples mentioned above. The pteroma was entirely enclosed by walls with engaged
columns showing externally, and was of extraordinary width. The walls of the narrow cella
were interrupted by heavy piers supporting atlantes, or applied statues under the ceiling. There
seem to have been windows between these figures, but it is not clear whence they borrowed their
light, unless it was admitted by the omission of the metopes between the external triglyphs.

+THE TRANSITION.+ During the transitional period there was a marked improvement in the proportions,
detail, and workmanship of the temples. The cella was made broader, the columns more slender,
the entablature lighter. The triglyphs disappeared from the cella wall, and sculpture of a
higher order enhanced the architectural effect. The profiles of the mouldings and especially
of the capitals became more subtle and refined in their curves, while the development of the
Ionic order in important monuments in Asia Minor was preparing the way for the splendors of
the Periclean age. Three temples especially deserve notice: the +Athena Temple+ on the island
of +Ægina+, the +Temple of Zeus+ at +Olympia+, and the so-called +Theseum+--perhaps a temple of Heracles--in
Athens. They belong to the period 470-450 B.C.; they are all hexastyle and peripteral, and
without triglyphs on the cella wall. Of the three the second in the list is interesting as the scene
of those rites which preceded and accompanied the Panhellenic Olympian games, and as the central
feature of the Altis, the most complete temple-group and enclosure among all Greek remains.
It was built of a coarse conglomerate, finished with fine stucco, and embellished with sculpture
by the greatest masters of the time. The adjacent +Heraion+ (temple of Hera) was a highly venerated
and ancient shrine, originally built with wooden columns which, according to Pausanias, were
replaced one by one, as they decayed, by stone columns. The truth of this statement is attested
by the discovery of a singular variety of capitals among its ruins, corresponding to the various
periods at which they were added. The Theseum is the most perfectly preserved of all Greek temples,
and in the refinement of its forms is only surpassed by those of the Periclean age.

+THE PERICLEAN AGE.+ The Persian wars may be taken as the dividing
line between the Transition period and the Periclean age.

The élan of national enthusiasm that followed the expulsion of the invader, and the glory and
wealth which accrued to Athens as the champion of all Hellas, resulted in a splendid reconstruction
of the Attic monuments as well as a revival of building activity in Asia Minor. By the wise administration
of Pericles and by the genius of Ictinus, Phidias, and other artists of surpassing skill, the
Acropolis at Athens was crowned with a group of buildings and statues absolutely unrivalled.
Chief among them was the +Parthenon+, the shrine of Athena Parthenos, which the critics of all
schools have agreed in considering the most faultless in design and execution of all buildings erected
by man (Figs. 31, 34, and Frontispiece). It was an octastyle peripteral temple, with seventeen
columns on the side, and measured 220 by 100 feet on the top of the stylobate. It was the work
of Ictinus and Callicrates, built to enshrine the noble statue of the goddess by Phidias, a standing
chryselephantine figure forty feet high. It was the masterpiece of Greek architecture not only
by reason of its refinements of detail, but also on account of the
beauty of its sculptural adornments.

The frieze about the cella wall under the pteroma ceiling, representing in low relief with masterly
skill the Panathenaic procession; the sculptured groups in the metopes, and the superb assemblages
of Olympic and symbolic figures of colossal size in the pediments, added their majesty to the
perfection of the architecture. Here also the horizontal curvatures and other refinements are
found in their highest development. Northward from it, upon the Acropolis, stood the +Erechtheum+, an
excellent example of the Attic-Ionic style (Figs.
 He lived there with his ambitions, which
were many. That morning he had gone, without knowing why, down through the tobacco-field to
the stream which parted his patrimony from his neighbour's grassy orchard. And there, beneath
the apple tree, across the clear, brown water stood Jacqueline. He forgot her no more. "Fontenoy"
was again the magic word, the "Open Sesame," but Jacqueline was the wealth of all the world.
He was young, and he was a man of strong passions who had lived, perforce, a rigid, lonely,
and ascetic life. He had dreamed of most things, and he had dreamed of love. It was the hectic
vision of a hued pool. Love, entered, proved to be the sea, boundless and strong, salt, clean,
and the nurse of life. He loved Jacqueline to the end of his life; he never swerved from allegiance
to the sea.

For a summer month he saw her almost every day,--twice or thrice beneath the apple tree beside
the stream, and at other times in Mrs. Jane Selden's parlour, porch, or little friendly garden.
He did not tell Jacqueline that he loved her; he had not dared so much. The fact that he was
the son of Gideon Rand while she was a Churchill mattered little to his common sense and his
Republicanism. His blood was clean. He had never heard of a Rand in prison or a beggar. Moreover,
he meant to make his name an honoured one. But he was a poor man, though he meant also to become
a rich man, and he was a Republican, with no thought of changing his party. Politics might
not matter, perhaps, to Miss Churchill, but they mattered decidedly to her uncles and guardians,
whom she loved and obeyed. Wealth and birth mattered too, to them. Lewis Rand set no great
store upon obedience for obedience' sake, but he divined that Miss Churchill rarely vexed those
she loved. He had an iron will, and he set his lips, and resolved that this was not the time
to speak of that ocean on whose shore he stood. He meant that the time should come. The probability
of a rejection he looked full in the face, and found that he did not believe in it, though
when he looked as fully at his assurance, that, too, became incredibly without foundation.
Jacqueline's spirit might dwell in the mountains, and never dream of the sea; she gave him
no sign, and he could not tell. The summer month went by; she returned to Fontenoy, and he
saw her no more for a long time. When she was gone, he fell upon work like a bereaved lion
upon his prey. As best he might, he would make that hunting do. He worked at first with lonely
fury, though at last with zest. Only by this road, he knew, could he enter the gates of Fontenoy.
Success begets success; let him make himself a name, and the gates might open! When he was
not in court, or not most diligently preparing a case, or not instructing Tom Mocket, who was
on the way to become his partner, or not busied with affairs of his patron, or not keenly observant
of the methods of the poor whites whom he hired to tend his tobacco, he read. He read history:
Clarendon, Gibbon, and Hume; Aristotle, Bacon, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, and Voltaire, Rousseau,
and Tom Paine. His Ossian, Cæsar, and Plutarch belonged to his younger days. A translation
of the Divina Commedia fell into his hands, and once he chanced to take up, and then read with
the closest attention, Godwin's Caleb Williams. From Monticello he received the hot and clamorous
journals of the day, Federalist and Republican. He studied the conditions they portrayed with
the intentness of a gladiator surveying his arena. The Examiner, the Argus, the Aurora, the
Gazette gave, besides the home conflict, the foreign news. He missed no step of Buonaparte's.

Thrice in these two years he had seen Jacqueline. Once he rode to church at Saint Anne's that
he might see her. She had been at the great race when Major Churchill's Mustapha won over Nonpareil
and Buckeye. The third time was a month ago in Charlottesville. She was walking, and Ludwell
Cary was with her. When she bowed to Rand, Cary had looked surprised, but his hat was instantly
off. Rand bowed in return, and passed them, going on to the Court House. He had not seen her
again until four days ago, when he opened his eyes upon her face. The golden finger on his
bed became a shining lance that struck across to the wall. There were ivy and a climbing rose
about the window through which he looked to the shimmering poplars and the distant hills. Many
birds were singing, and from the direction of the quarters sounded the faint blowing of a horn.
A bee came droning in to the pansies in a bowl. Rand's dark eyes made a journey through the
room, from the flowered curtains to the mandarin on the screen, from the screen to the willowed
china and the easy chair, from the chair to the picture of General Washington on the wall,
the vases on the mantel-shelf, and the green hemlock branches masking for the summer the fireplace
below. Over all the blue room and the landscape without was a sense of home, of order and familiar
sweetness. It struck to the soul of a too lonely and too self-reliant man. Suddenly, without
warning, tears were in his eyes. Raising his uninjured arm, he brushed them away, settled his
bandaged head upon the pillows, and stared at the clock. The half-shut door of a small adjoining
room opened very slowly and softly, and Joab entered on tiptoe, elaborate caution surrounding
him like an atmosphere.

"You, Joab," said Rand. "It's time you were in the field."

Joab's preternaturally lengthened countenance became short, broad, and genial. He threw back
his head and breathed relief. "Dar now! What I tell em? Cyarn Selim nor no urr boss kill you,
Marse Lewis! Mornin', sah. I reckon hit is time I wuz in de field, but I reckon I got to stay
heah to tek care of you. How yo ahm, Marse Lewis?"

"It's not so bad."

"You sho wuz ressless in yo sleep--a-talkin' an' a-turnin' an' sayin' you mustn't keep de cote
waitin'. I done sit by you ter keep de kivers on twill de cock crow. What you reckon you said
to me? You said, 'Is dat you, Gineral Buonaparte?'"

Rand laughed, "Did you say, 'Yes, sire my brother?'"

"No, sah, I say, 'Hit's Joab, Marse Lewis.' I gwine now ter git de water to shave you ef dar's
fire in de kitchen. Folks git up moughty late at Fontenoy. I don' know when I gwine git yo
breakfast."

An hour later appeared the master of the house, red and jovial, solicitous for his guest's
comfort, and prodigal of suggestions for his ease and entertainment. Not until Rand was well
and gone from Fontenoy would Colonel Dick let his mind rest upon the indubitable fact that
here had been an upstart and an enemy. Hard upon the Colonel's steps came the doctor. Arm and
ankle and wounded head were doing well--there was no fever to speak of--Mr. Rand had an unabused
constitution and would make a rapid recovery. For precaution's sake, best let a little blood.
Rest, gruel, and quiet, and in a few days Mr. Rand would be downstairs with the ladies. The
blood was let, and the doctor rode away. Joab and the culprit Selim went on Rand's errands
to the town and to the home on the Three-Notched Road. Mammy Chloe, in white apron and kerchief
and coloured turban, presented herself with a curtsy, delivered kindly messages from the ladies
of the house, and sat down with her sewing in the little adjoining room. The morning advanced,
sunny and peaceful, with vague sounds, faint laughter from distant rooms, droning of bees,
and rustling of cool poplar leaves.

Rand, lying high upon his pillows, stopped his work of writing with his left hand to listen
to a step coming up the polished stairway and along the passage leading to his room. His ear
was almost as quick and accurate as was Adam Gaudylock's, and he rightly thought he knew the
step. A somewhat strange smile was on his lips when Ludwell Cary knocked lightly at the blue
room door. "Come in!" called Rand, and Cary, entering, closed the door behind him and came
up to the bed with an outstretched hand and a pleasant light upon his handsome face.

"Ah, Mr. Rand," he said, smiling, "I see my revenge. I shall sit each day by your bedside,
and read you the Federalist! How is the arm? Your right! That's bad!"

"It will heal," answered Rand. "Will you not take a chair?"

Cary pushed the easy chair nearer the bed, and sat down. "The ladies charge me," he said pleasantly,
"with more messages of sympathy and hopes for your recovery than I can remember. Miss Dandridge
vows that you have supplanted in her affections the hero of her favourite romance. 'Twas she
and my brother, you know, who found you upon the road. Colonel Churchill and the county must
mend that turn where you came to grief. It is a dangerous place."

"I was not attentive," said Rand, "and my horse is a masterful brute. Pray assure Miss Dandridge
and your brother of my gratitude. I am under deep obligation to all at Fontenoy."

"It is a kindly place," said Cary simply. He looked about him. "The blue room! When I was a
boy and came a-visiting, they always put me here. That screen would set me dreaming--and the
blue roses and the moon clock. I used to lie in that bed and send myself to sleep with more
tales than are in the Arabian Nights. There's a rift in the poplars through which you can see
a very bright star--Sirius, I believe. May you have pleasant dreams, Mr. Rand, in my old bed!"
He glanced from Rand's flushed face to the papers strewn upon the counterpane. "You have been
writing? Would Dr. Gilmer approve?"

Rand looked somewhat ruefully at the scrawled sheets and the ink upon his fingers. "It is a
necessary paper of instructions," he said. "I was retained by the State for the North Garden
murder case. It is to be tried next week--and here am I, laid by the heels! My associate must
handle it." He made a movement of impatience. "He's skilful enough, but he's not the sort to
convince a jury--especially in Albemarle, where they don't like to hang people. If he's left
to himself, Fitch may go free."

"The murderer?"

"Yes, the murderer. These," he laid his hand upon the papers, "are the points that must be
made. If Mocket follows instructions, the State will win. But I wish that Selim had not chosen
to break my right arm--it is difficult to write with the left hand."

"Could not Mr. Mocket take his instructions directly from you?"

Rand moved again impatiently, and with a quick sigh. "I sent him word not to come. I will not
bring a friend or ally where I myself must seem an intruder and a most unwelcome guest. There's
a fine irony in human affairs! Selim might have thrown me before Edgehill or Dunlora--but to
choose Fontenoy!" He looked at Cary with a certain appeal. "I shall, of course, remove myself
as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you could assure me that Colonel Churchill and his
family understand--"

"Set your mind at rest," said Cary at once. "Colonel Churchill is the soul of kindness and
hospitality, and the ladies of Fontenoy are all angels. You must not think yourself an unwelcome
guest." He glanced again at the papers. "I am sure you should not try to write. Will you not
accept me as amanuensis? The matter is not private?"

Not at all: but--"

"Then let me write from your dictation. I have nothing at all to do for the next two hours,--I
am staying in the house, you know,--and it will give me genuine pleasure to help you. You have
no business with such labour. Dr. Gilmer, I know, must have forbidden it. Come! I write a very
fair clerkly hand."

"You don't know the imposition," said Rand, with an answering smile. "It is nothing less than
a Treatise on Murder."

"I shall be glad," replied Cary, "to hear what you have to say on the subject. Come! here are
blank sheets and a new quill and an attentive secretary!"

Rand smiled. "It's the strangest post for you!--but all life's a dream just now. I confess
that writing is uphill work! Well--since you are so good."

He began to dictate. At first his words came slowly, with some stiffness and self-consciousness.
This passed; he forgot himself, thought only of his subject, and utterance became quiet, grave,
and fluent. He did not speak as though he were addressing a jury. Gesture was impossible, and
his voice must not carry beyond the blue room. He spoke as to himself, as giving reasons to
a high intelligence for the invalidity of murder. For an infusion of sentiment and rhetoric
he knew he might trust Mocket's unaided powers, but the basis of the matter he would furnish.
He spoke of murder as the check the savage gives to social order, as the costliest error, the
last injustice, the monstrousness beyond the brute, the debt without surety, the destruction
by a fool of that which he knows not how to create. He spoke for society, without animus and
without sentiment; in a level voice marshalling fact and example, and moving unfalteringly
toward the doom of the transgressor. Turning to the case in hand, he wove strand by strand
a rope for the guilty wretch in question; then laid it for the nonce aside and spoke of murder
more deeply with a sombre force and a red glow of imagery. Then followed three minutes of slow
words which laid the finished and tested rope in the sheriff's hand. Rand's voice ceased, and
he lay staring at the poplar leaves without the window.

Cary laid the pen softly down, sat still and upright in his chair for a minute, then leaned
back with a long breath. "The poor wretch!" he said.

"Poor enough," assented Rand abruptly. "But Nature does not, and Society must not, think of
that. As he brewed, so let him drink, and the measure that he meted, let it be meted to him
again. There is on earth no place for him." He fell silent again, his eyes upon the dancing leaves.

"You will make your mark," said Cary slowly. "This is more than able work. You have before
you a great future."

Rand looked at him half eagerly, half wistfully. "Do you really think that?"

"I cannot think otherwise," Cary answered. "I saw it plainly in the courtroom the other day."
He smiled. "I deplore your political principles, Mr. Rand, but I rejoice that my conqueror
is no lesser man. I must to work against the next time we encounter."

"You have been long out of the county," said Rand. "I had the start of you, that is all. You
were trained to the law. Will you practise it, or will Greenwood take all your time?"

"I shall practise. A man's life is larger than a few acres, a house, and slaves. But first
I must put Greenwood in order, and I must--" He did not finish the sentence, but sat looking
about the blue room. "The old moon clock! I used to listen to it in the night and dream of
twenty thousand things, and never once of what I dream of now! What a strange young savage
is a boy!" He gathered the written sheets together. "You will want to look these over? I shall
be very glad to see that they reach Mr. Mocket safely, or to serve you in any way. Just now
I am very idle, and I will be your secretary every day with pleasure." He rose. "And now you
must rest, or we will have a rating from Dr. Gilmer. Is there any message I may take for you?"

"My devotion and my thanks to the ladies of the house," replied Rand--"to Mrs. Churchill and
Miss Dandridge and to Miss Churchill. For these"--he put his hand upon the papers--"I shall
look them over, and Joab will take them to Charlottesville to Mocket. I cannot sufficiently
thank you for your aid and for your kindness."

Cary went, and Rand lay back upon his pillows, weary enough, though with a smile upon his lips.
He valued Cary's visit, valued the opinion of his fellow lawyer and fellow thinker. He valued
praise from almost any source, though this was a hidden thirst. Where he loved, there he valued
good opinion most; but also he strongly desired that his enemies should think highly of him.
To be justly feared was one thing, to be contemned quite another. Apparently Ludwell Cary neither
feared nor contemned. As, a few days before on the Justice's Bench, Rand had wondered if he
were going to hate Cary, so now, lying in the quiet blue room, weakened by pain and loss of
blood, softened by exquisite kindness, and touched by approbation, he wondered if he were going
to like Cary. Something of the old charm, the old appeal, the old recognition, with no mean
envy, of a golden nature moving in harmonious circumstance, stirred in Lewis Rand's breast.
He sighed and lay still, his eyes upon the pansies on the table beside his bed. The moon clock
ticked; the sunshine entered softly through the veil of poplar leaves; upon the bough that
brushed the window, a cicada shrilled of the approaching summer. Rand put out his uninjured
arm and took a pansy from the bowl. The little face, brave and friendly, looked at him from
the white counterpane where he laid it. He studied it for a while, touching it gently, with
the thought in his mind that Jacqueline might have gathered the pansies, and then he left it
there, took up his papers, and turned to the argument which must hang Fitch.

CHAPTER VIII

CARY AND JACQUELINE

At supper table that evening at Fontenoy, Ludwell Cary said something complimentary to the
prisoner in the blue room. Fairfax Cary fired up. "You are too easy, Ludwell! Lewis Rand, I
warn you, is a dangerous man! Serve him once, and you serve him once too often!--begging your
pardon, Colonel Churchill!"

"We could hardly have left him, you know," reasoned his host good-naturedly, "on the roadside,
and Dick Wood's the nearest house! And once within a man's doors, every attention, of course,
must be shown. But, as you say, he is a dangerous fellow."

"Dangerous fiddlesticks!" growled Major Churchill from the other side of the table, where he
sat at Jacqueline's right hand. "I would have as soon called old Gideon Rand dangerous! Like
father, like son. You may be sure that this fellow's spirit rolls tobacco. Maybe now and then
it breaks a colt.

"Dangerous' implies power to be dangerous," said Cary, "and conversely power to be humane.
A turn, and all the strength of the man may flow toward good."

"A fool and his doctrine!" snapped Major Edward. "I do not expect grapes from thistles, or
a silk purse from a sow's ear."

"Tut, tut, Ned! The man who carries this county may be a damned Republican, but he is not a
fool," pronounced Colonel Dick. "Jacqueline, my dear, another cup of coffee."

"If we were all as good as gold," said Unity pensively, "and as wise as--as Socrates, and wore
black cockades, and cared only for the Washington March, and hated Buonaparte, and the Devil,
how tiresome life would be!--Myself, I like variety and the Marseillaise!"

"Then you differ from the other rogues only in liking the Rogue's March," said Uncle Edward.
"Jacqueline, more sugar!"

The younger Cary rushed to Miss Dandridge's defence. "Well, sir, in itself the Marseillaise
is a very noble air. It is better than Jefferson's March!"

"Oh, a very good air to go to the gallows by!" snapped Uncle Edward. "Jacqueline, some cream!"

"Well, well," said his brother amicably, from the head of the table, "we must care for a man
when he's wounded at our door, friend or foe, Federalist or damned Republican. Noblesse oblige.
I was glad enough the night my mare Nelly threw me, coming home from Maria Erskine's wedding,
to hear Bob Carter's voice behind me! And if Gideon Rand was a surly old heathen, he broke
colts well, and he rolled tobacco well. We'll treat his son like a Christian."

"And he'll repay you like a Turk!" broke out Major Edward. "I tell you it is bred in the bone--"

"Mr. Rand is our guest," said Jacqueline, in a clear voice, from her place behind the coffee
urn. Her hands made a little noise amid the rosebud china. "Mr. Cary, may I not pour you another
cup?--Caleb, Mr. Cary's cup.--Bring more waffles, Scipio."

"The work at Greenwood is nearly finished, sir," remarked Ludwell Cary, addressing his host.
"I rode over this afternoon, and the men assure me that the house will soon be habitable. Fair
and I have no excuse for staying longer."

"Then stay without excuse," answered Colonel Dick heartily. "Fontenoy will miss you--eh, Unity,
eh, Jacqueline?"

"It will indeed," said Jacqueline, with a smile; and Unity, "Will I have time to order a black
scarf from Baltimore? Will you leave us mourning rings?"

"If Miss Dandridge would accept another fashion of ring!" cried Fairfax Cary, and all at table
laughed. Scipio took away the rosebud china, and laid the purple dessert service for the strawberries
and floating island and Betty Custis cake. Caleb placed the decanters of claret and Madeira,
and the Fontenoy men began to talk of horse-racing, of Mustapha, Nonpareil, York, and Victor.

Jacqueline and Unity, leaving the gentlemen at their wine, came out into the broad hall and
stood at the front door looking out at the coloured clouds above the hills. They supped early
at Fontenoy, and the evening was yet rosy.

"He is going to speak to-night," said Unity, with conviction. "It is written in his eye."

"If you mean Mr. Cary--"

"Whom else should I mean? What are you going to say to him, Jacqueline? I want you to say Yes,
and I want you to say No."

"Don't, Unity--"

"If you say Yes, you will have Greenwood and the most charming husband in the world, and be
envied of every girl in the county; and if you say No, I'll have you still--"

"I shall say No."

"What ails you, Jacqueline? I could swear that you're in love, and yet I don't believe you
are in love with Ludwell Cary!--though I am sure you ought to be. It's not Mr. Lee, nor Mr.
Page, nor Jack Martin, nor--you're never in love with Fairfax Cary?"

Jacqueline laughed, "How absurd, Unity!--though may be some day I shall love him as a cousin!"

Unity regarded her with a puzzled gathering of black brows. "There's no one else that by any
stretch of imagination I can believe you in love with--unless it's Mr. Pincornet!"

"Oh, now you certainly have it!" cried Jacqueline, with another tremulous laugh. She released
herself from her cousin's arm. "I am going to tell Deb good-night. And Unity--I don't want
Mr. Cary to speak to-night, nor to-morrow night, nor any other night! I'll stay at Fontenoy--I'll
stay at Fontenoy and care for Aunt Nancy and Deb and Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward. I'll dance
at your wedding, Unity, but you'll not dance at mine!"

She was gone. Unity sat down upon the porch steps and began to name upon her fingers the eligible
young men of three counties. In her anxiety to account for Jacqueline's pallor and the dark
beneath her eyes, she went far afield, but she met with no success. "It's not one of them!"
she sighed at last. "And yet, she's changed--"

Jacqueline went slowly upstairs, a slender figure in white, touching with her hand the polished
balustrade. When she reached the long and wide upper hall, she passed steadily along it, but
she turned her eyes upon a door at the far end, the door of the blue room. Arrived in her own
cool and fragrant chamber, she found Deb already asleep in the small bed, her yellow hair spread
upon the pillow, her gown open at the throat, a rag doll in the hollow of her arm. Upon the
floor, with her head against the bed, sat Miranda, as fast asleep as her mistress. At Jacqueline's
touch she awoke, smiled widely, and was on her feet with a spring. "Yaas, Miss Jacqueline,
I done put Miss Deb to bed. Mammy Chloe say dat niggah Joab don' know nothin' 'bout er broken
ahm, an' she too busy in de blue room. Yaas'm, I done mek Miss Deb wash her face an' say her
prayers. Kin I go now?"

Alone, Jacqueline stood for a minute beside the sleeping child, then bent and kissed Deb's
brown neck. Moving to a window, she sat down before it, resting her arm upon the sill and her
head upon her arm. Outside the window grew a giant fir tree, shading the room, and giving it
at times an aspect too cold and northern. But Jacqueline loved the tree, and loved and fed
the birds that in winter perched upon the dark boughs. Now, between the needles, the eastern
sky looked blue and cold. Jacqueline, sitting idle, felt her eyes fill with slow tears. They
did not fall. She was not lacking in self-control, and she told herself that of late she had
wept too often. She sat very still, her head bowed upon her listless arm, while the moments
passed, bearing with them pictures seen through unshed tears. She was living over the days
of the Three-Notched Road, and she beheld each shifting scene by the light of a passion that
she believed to be unreasonable, unnatural, secret, and without hope. Her uncle's voice came
to her from the hall below. "Jacqueline, Jacqueline!" She arose, bathed her eyes, and went
downstairs.

It was the custom of the family to gather after supper upon the great white pillared porch,
and to sit through the twilight. The men smoked slowly and reflectively, the women sat with
folded hands, watching the last glow upon the hills, and the brightening of the evening star;
dreamily listening to the choir of frogs, the faint tinkle of cowbells, the bleating of folded
lambs, and the continual rustle of the poplar leaves.

Jacqueline took her seat beside Unity. Colonel Churchill, in his especial chair, was smoking
like a benevolent volcano; at a small table Major Edward was playing Patience. On the broad
porch steps below Jacqueline and Unity half sat, half lay, the two Carys. The fireflies were
beginning to show, and out of the distance came a plaintive Whip-poor-will--Whip-poor-will!

"I shall have," said Ludwell Cary, "the vines at Greenwood trained like these. There could
be no better way."

"Is the drawing-room finished?" asked Unity.

"Almost finished. The paper came to-day from Baltimore. The ground is silver, and there are
garlands of roses and a host of piping shepherds."

"Oh, lovely!" cried Unity. "But no shepherdesses?"

"Yes, in among the roses. It is quite Arcadian. When will the princesses come to see the shepherdesses?"

He looked at them both. "The Princess and her waiting-maid," said Unity demurely, "will come
very soon." She rose from the green bench. "The waiting-maid is going now to her harpsichord!"
Her eyes rested upon the younger Cary. "Will you be so very good as to turn the leaves for me?"

Fairfax Cary embracing with alacrity the chance of goodness, the two went into the house. The
dusk deepened; the odour of honeysuckle and syringa grew heavier, and white moths sailed by
on their way to the lighted windows.

     "Since love--since love is blissful sorrow,
     Then bid the lad--then bid the lad--
     Then bid the lad a fair good morrow!"

flowed in soprano from the parlour.

Colonel Churchill laid down his pipe and lifted his burly figure from the great chair. "I forgot,"
he remarked to Jacqueline, "to tell your Aunt Nancy that Charles Carter is going to marry Miss
Lewis," and he left the porch. The rose in the sky turned to pearl, the fireflies grew brilliant,
and the wind brought the murmur of streams and the louder rustling of the poplar leaves. "It
is too dark to see the cards," said Major Edward. "I'll go read what the Gazette has to say
of Burr and the Massachusetts secession fools. Don't move, Cary!" He deftly gathered up the
cards, and went indoors.

     "When I was green in years, and every month was May"--sang Unity.

     "With Phyllis and with Chloe made I holiday!"

"It is dark night," said Jacqueline. "Shall we not go in?"

Cary put out an appealing hand. "Don't rise! May we not stay like this a little longer?--Miss
Churchill, there is something that I ardently wish to say to you."

"Yes, Mr. Cary?"

"It is too soon to speak, I know,--it must seem too soon to you. But to-day I said, 'The spring
is flying--I'll put my fortune to the touch!' I think that you must guess the thing I wish
to say--"

"Yes, I know. I wish that you would leave it unsaid."

"I love you. On the day, three months ago, when I saw you after my return and found the lovely
child I remembered changed into the loveliest of all women, I loved you. If then, what now,
when I have seen you, day by day?--I love you, and I shall never cease to love you."

"Oh, with all my heart I wish that you did not!"

"I ask you to be my wife. I beg you to let me prove throughout my life the depth of my love,
of my solicitude for your happiness--"

"Ah, happiness!" cried Jacqueline sharply. "I do not see it in my life. The best that you can
do is to forget me quite."

"I will remember you when I draw my dying breath. And if we remember after death, I will remember
you then. With all my strength I love you."

"I am sorry--I am sorry!" she cried. "Oh, I hoped 'twas but a fancy, and that you would not
speak! I do not love you--"

"Let me wait," said Cary, after a pause. "I said that I was speaking too soon. Let me wait--let
me prove to you. Your heart may turn."

She shook her head. "It will not change."

"Is there," asked Cary, in a low voice, "is there another before me?"

She looked at him strangely. "You have no right to question me. I do not think that I shall
ever marry. For you, you will live long and be happy. You deserve happiness. If I have wounded
you, may it soon heal! Forget this night, and me."

"Forget!" said Cary. "I am not so lightly made! But neither will I despair. I will wait. If
there is no man before me, I will win you yet! There is little reason, God knows, why you should
care for me, but I shall strive to make that reason greater!"

"There is reason," answered Jacqueline. "I think highly, highly of you! You would make a woman
happy;--all her life she would travel a sunny road! I prize your friendship--I am loth to lose
it. But as for me,"--she locked her hands against her breast,--"there is that within me that
cries, The shadowed road!--the shadowed road!"

She rose, and Cary rose with her. "Forgive me," she said. "Is it not cruel that we hurt each
other so? Forgive--forget."

"I would forgive you," he answered, with emotion, "the suffering and the sorrow of a thousand
lives. But forget you--never! I'll love you well and I'll love you long. Nor will I despair.
To-night is dark, but the sun may shine to-morrow. Think of me as of one who will love you
to the end." He took her hand and kissed it, then stood aside, saying, "I will not face the
lights quite yet." She passed into the hail and up the stairway, and he turned and went down
the porch steps into the May night.

CHAPTER IX

EXPOSTULATION

The next morning Ludwell Cary rose early, ordered his horse, and opened the door of his brother's
room. "Fair," he said, as the younger Cary sat up in bed, with a nightcap wonderfully askew
upon his handsome head, "I am off for Greenwood. Make my excuses, will you, to Colonel Churchill
and the ladies? I will not be back till supper-time." He turned to leave the room. "And Fair--if
you have anything to say to Miss Dandridge, this is the shepherd's hour. We go home to-morrow."

"What the Devil?"--began the younger Cary.

"No, not the Devil," said the other, with a twist of the lip half humorous, half piteous. "Just
woman."

He was gone. Fairfax Cary looked at his watch, then rose from his bed and looked out of the
window at the rose and dew of the dawn. "What the Devil!" he said again to himself; and then,
with a forehead of perplexity, "He was up late last night--out in the garden alone. He rides
off to Greenwood with the dawn, and we go home to-morrow. She can't have refused him--that's
not possible!" He went back to bed to study matters over. At last, "The jade!" he exclaimed
with conviction, and two hours later, when he came down to breakfast, wished Miss Churchill
good-morning with glacial courtesy.

Jacqueline, behind the coffee urn, had heavy-lidded eyes, and her smile was tremulous. Unity,
brilliant and watchful, regarded the universe and the hauteur of young Mr. Cary with lifted
brows. Major Churchill, when he appeared, shot one glance at the place that was Ludwell Cary's,
another at his niece, then sat heavily down, and in a querulous voice demanded coffee. Colonel
Dick wore a frown. Deb, who before breakfast had visited a new foal in the long pasture, kept
for a time the ball of conversation rolling; but the dulness and the chill in the air presently
enwrapped her also. The meal came to an end with only one hazard as to what could have taken
Ludwell Cary to Greenwood for the entire day. That was Unity's, who remarked that pains must
be bestowed upon the hanging of a drawing-room paper, else the shepherds and the shepherdesses
would not match.

Fairfax Cary asked after Lewis Rand and his broken arm, and Colonel Dick responded with absent-mindedness
that the arm did very well, and that its owner would soon be going about his business with
all the rest of the damned Republican mischief-makers: then, "Scipio, did you take that julep
and bird up to the blue room?"

"Yaas, marster," answered Scipio. "The gent'man say tell you 'Thank you.' He say he ain't gwine
trouble you much longer, an' he cyarn never forgit what Fontenoy's done fer him."

"Deb!" said Uncle Edward, with great sharpness, "you are spilling that cup of milk. Look what
you are doing, child!"

The uncomfortable meal came to an end. Outside the dining-room door Uncle Dick mentioned to
Unity that her aunt wanted her in the chamber to cut off linsey gowns for the house servants,
and Uncle Edward inquired if it would be troublesome to Fairfax Cary to ride over to Tom Wood's
and take a look at that black stallion Tom bragged of. Unity went to her aunt's chamber; the
younger Cary walked away somewhat stiffly to the stables; Uncle Edward sent Deb to her lessons,
and Uncle Dick told Jacqueline to come in half an hour to the library. Edward and he wanted
to speak to her.

Jacqueline gave her directions, or her aunt's directions, to Scipio, then crossed the paved
way to the kitchen and talked of dinner and supper with the turbaned cook; opened with her
keys the smokehouse door, and in the storeroom superintended the weighing of flour and sugar
and the measuring of Java coffee, and finally saw that the drawing-room was properly darkened
against the sunny morning, and that the water was fresh in the bowls of flowers. She leaned
for a moment against her harp, one hand upon its strings, her forehead resting upon her bare
arm; then she turned from the room and entered the library, where she found her uncles waiting
for her, Uncle Dick upon the hearth rug and Uncle Edward at the table.

"Jacqueline," began the first, then, "Edward, I never could talk to a woman! Ask her what all
this damned nonsense means!"

"Your uncle doesn't mean that it is all damned nonsense, Jacqueline," said Uncle Edward, with
gentleness. "Not perhaps from your point of view, my dear. But both he and I are greatly grieved
and disappointed--"

"It was all arranged ages ago!" broke in the elder brother. "Fauquier Cary and your dear father,
my brother Henry, settled it when you were born and Fauquier's son was a lad at Maury's school!
When Henry died, and Fauquier Cary died, my brother Edward here and I said to each other that
we would see the matter out! So we will, by God!"

"Gently, Dick! Jacqueline, child, you know how dear you are to us, and how the future and the
happiness of you and of Unity and of Deb is our jealous care--"

"Fauquier Cary was as noble a man as ever breathed," cried the other, "and his son's his image!
There's no better blood in Virginia--and the land beside--"

"It does not matter about the land, Jacqueline," said Uncle Edward, "though God forbid that
I should depreciate good land--"

"Land's land," quoth Colonel Dick, "and good blood's gospel truth!"

"Bah! it's nature's truth!" said Uncle Edward. "Jacqueline, my dear, our hearts are set on
this match. Mr. Ludwell Cary asked your uncle's permission to speak to you, and your uncle
gave it gladly, and neither he nor I ever dreamed--"

"Of course we didn't," broke in the other. "We didn't dream that Jacqueline could be unreasonable
or ungrateful, and we don't dream it now! Nor blind. Ludwell Cary's a man and a gentleman,
and the woman who gets him is lucky!"

"We approved his suit, Jacqueline, and we hoped to be happy to-day in your happiness--"

"And in he comes at midnight last night, with his father's own look on his face, and what does
he say to Edward and me, sitting here, waiting, with a thousand fancies in our heads? 'Miss
Churchill will not have me,' says he, 'and you who have been so good to me, are to be good
still, and not by word or look reproach her or distress her. The heart goes its own way, and
loves where it must. She is an angel, and to-night I am a poor beaten and weary mortal. I thank
you again, both of you, and wish you good-night.' And off he goes before a man could say Jack
Robinson! Those were his very words, weren't they, Edward?"

"Yes," answered Edward. "He is a brave and gallant gentleman, Jacqueline. I love you, child,
more than my old tongue can say. My Castle in Spain is Greenwood with you and Ludwell Cary
and the children of you both."

"Oh, cruel!" cried Jacqueline. "He is brave and good--He is all that you say. But I shall never
live at Greenwood!"

"It was your father's dearest wish," said the Major. "It is ours--Richard's and mine. We are
not men who give up easily. God forbid, child, that I should hint to you, who are the darling
of us all, of obligation--and yet I put it to you if obedience is not owed--"

"Yes, yes," answered Jacqueline. "It is owed. I am not ungrateful--I am mad--perhaps I am wicked!
I wish that I were dead!"

"The Churchills," said Uncle Edward, "have never in their marriages set vulgar store by money.
Blood we ask, of course, and honourable position, and the right way of thinking. Individually
I am a stickler for mind. To his wealth and to his name and his great personal advantages Ludwell
Cary adds intellect. He may become a power in his country and his time. You would so aid him,
child! I am called a woman-hater, but once, Jacqueline, I loved too well. For all that I am
a sorry old bachelor, I know whereof I speak. With a man, a woman to fight for is not half
the battle--it is all the battle."

"He is all that you say," answered Jacqueline. "But I do not love him."

"You like him. You admire him."

"Yes, yes. That is not love."

"It is mighty near kin," said Uncle Dick. "No end of happy folk begin with esteem and go on
like turtle doves. My little Jack, you shall have the prettiest wedding gown! It's all a mistake
and a misunderstanding, and the good Lord knows there's too much of both in this old world!
You'll think better of it all, and you'll find that you didn't know your own mind,--and there'll
be a smile for poor Cary when he comes riding back to-night?"

"No, no," cried Jacqueline. "There is no mistake and no misunderstanding. Love cannot be forced,
and I'll not marry where I do not love!"

"You don't," said Colonel Churchill slowly, "you don't by any chance love some one else? What
does that colour mean, Jacqueline? Don't stammer! Speak out!"

But Jacqueline, standing by the old leather chair, bowed her head upon its high green back,
and neither could nor would "speak out." The two men, grey and withered, obstinate and imperious
in a day and generation that subordinated youth to the councils of the old, gazed at their
niece with perplexity and anger. With the simpler of the two the perplexity was the greater,
with the other anger. A fear was knocking at Major Churchill's heart. He would not admit it,
strove not to listen to it, or to listen with contemptuous incredulity. "It's not possible,"
he said to himself. "Not a thousand summers at Jane Selden's would make her so forget herself!
Jacqueline in love with that damned Jacobin demagogue upstairs! Pshaw!" But the fear knocked on.

Jacqueline lifted her head. "Be good to me, Uncle Dick! If I could love, if I could marry Mr.
Cary, I would--I would indeed! But I cannot. Please let me go!"

"Not till I know more than I know now," said Colonel Churchill. "If it's George Lee, Jacqueline,
I'll not say a word, sorry as I am for Cary. But if it's Will Allen, I'll see you dead before
I give my consent! He's a spendthrift and a Republican!"

"I care neither for Mr. Lee nor Mr. Allen," said Jacqueline, with a burning cheek. "Oh, Uncle
Edward, make Uncle Dick let me go!"

"It is not wise," Major Churchill considered within himself, "to push a woman too far. I'm
a suspicious fool to think this thing of Jacqueline. It's all some girl's fancy or other, and
if we go easily Cary will yet win--by God, he shall win! This damned Yahoo upstairs is neither
here nor there!"

He spoke aloud to his brother. "Best let the child go think it over, Dick. She knows her duty--and
that we expect her compliance. She doesn't want to wound us cruelly, to make us unhappy, to
prove herself blind and ingrate. Give her a kiss and let her go."

"You come down and sing to us to-night, my little Jack, in your blue gown," quoth Uncle Dick.
"Don't you ever let a time come when your singing won't be the sweetest sound in the world
to me! Now go, and think of what we have said, and of poor Cary, ridden off to Greenwood!"

Jacqueline gazed at the two for a moment, and made as if to speak, but the words died in her
throat. She uttered a broken cry, turned, groped a little for the door, found and opened it,
and was gone. They heard the click of her slippers upon the stairs, and presently the closing
of a blind in the room that was hers.

The brothers sat heavily on in the sunshine-flooded library, the elder red and fuming, the
younger silent and saturnine. At last Colonel Dick broke out, "What the devil ails her, Edward?
Every decent young fellow in the county comes to Fontenoy straight as a bee to the honey-pot!
I've heard them sighing for her and Unity, but I never could see that she favoured one man
more than another,--and she's no coquette like Unity! Except for that fine blush of hers, I'd
never have thought. What do you think, Edward?"

"The ways of women are past my finding out," said Edward. "Let it rest for a while, Dick."
He rose from his chair stiffly, like an old man. "Let Cary go home to-morrow as he intends.
'Absence makes the heart grow fonder,' they say. She may find that she misses him, and may
look for him when he comes riding over. Never fear but he'll ride over often! He mustn't guess,
of course, that you have spoken to her. And that's all we can do, Dick, except--" Major Edward
walked stiffly across the floor and paused before the portrait of his brother Henry, dead and
gone these many years. The face looked imperiously down upon him. Henry had stood for something
before he died,--for grace and manly beauty, pride and fire. The Major's eyes suddenly smarted.
"Poor white trash," he said between his teeth, "and Henry's daughter!" He turned and came back
to the table. "Dick! just as soon as you can, you clear the house of old Gideon Rand's son!"

"What's he got to do with it?" asked Colonel Dick.

"I don't know," said the other. "But I want him out of the blue room, and out of Fontenoy!
and now, Dick, I've got a piece to write this morning on the designs of Aaron Burr."

At five in the afternoon Cary returned, quiet and handsome, ready with his account of matters
at Greenwood, from the stable, upon which Major Churchill must pronounce, to the drawing-room
paper, which awaited Miss Dandridge's sentence. His behaviour was perfection, but "He's hard
hit," said his brother to himself. "What, pray, would Miss Churchill have?" And Unity, "The
shepherds and shepherdesses don't match. How can she have the heart?" And Major Churchill,
"Are women blind? This is Hyperion to a satyr." And Jacqueline, "Oh, miserable me! Is he writing
or reading, or is he lying thinking, there in the blue room?"

CHAPTER X

TO ALTHEA

Adam Gaudylock came, when his leisure served him, to Fontenoy as he went everywhere, by virtue
of his quality of free lance and golden-tongued narrator of western news. The stress of thought
at the moment was to the West and the empire that had been purchased there; and a man from
beyond Kentucky, with tales to tell of the Mississippi Territory, brought his own welcome to
town, tavern, and plantation. If this were true of all, it was trebly true of Adam, who had
been born open-eyed. As the magnet draws the filings, so he drew all manner of tidings. News
came to him as by a thousand carrier pigeons. He took toll of the solitary in the brown and
pathless woods, of the boatmen upon fifty rivers, of the Indian braves about the council-fire,
of hunters, trappers, traders, and long lines of Conestoga wagons, of soldiers on frontier
posts, Jesuit missionaries upon the Ohio, camp-meeting orators by the Kentucky and the upper
James, martial emissaries of three governments, village lawyers, gamblers, dealers in lotteries,
and militia colonels, Spanish intendants, French agents, American settlers, wild Irish, thrifty
Germans, Creoles, Indians, Mestizos, Quadroons, Congo blacks,--from the hunter in the forest
to the slave in the fields, and from the Governor of the vast new territory to the boatman
upon a Mississippi ark, not a type of the restless time but imparted to Adam something of its
view of life and of the winds that vexed its sea. He was a skilful compounder, and when, forever
wandering, he wandered back by wood and stream to the sunny, settled lands east of the Blue
Ridge, he gave to the thirsty in plantation and town bright globules of hard fact in a heady
elixir of fancy. While he talked all men were adventurers, and all women admired him. Adam
liked this life and this world; asked nothing better than to journey through a hundred such.

Now, sitting at his ease in the blue room, a fortnight after Rand's accident, he delivered
a score of messages from the Republicans of the county, gentle and simple, whom he had chanced
to encounter since the accident to their representative.

"Colonel Randolph says the President has bad luck with the horses he gives--young Mr. Carr
was thrown by a bay mare from Shadwell. Old Jowett swears that a trooper of Tarleton's broke
his neck at that identical place--says you can hear him any dark night swearing like the Hessian
he was. They drank your health at the Eagle, the night they heard of the accident, with bumpers--drank
it just after Mr. Jefferson's and before the memory of Washington. 'Congress next!' they said.
'Hurrah! He'll scatter the Black Cockades--he'll make the Well-born cry King's Cruse! Hip,
hip, hurrah! What's he doing at Fontenoy? They'll put poison in his cup! Hurrah!'"

"Fontenoy will not put poison in my cup," said Rand. "I hope some one was there to say as much."

"I said it," answered Adam. "They are a noisy lot. Tom Mocket made a speech and compared you
to Moses. He wept when he made it, and they had to hold him steady on his feet. When they broke
up, I took him home to the Partridge. I'll tell you one speech that he never made by himself,
and that's the speech that's going to hang Fitch."

"No," said Rand. "I wrote it. You were at the trial?"

"Ay. It would have hung Abel, so poor Cain had no chance. Mr. Eppes says Mr. Jefferson counts
upon your becoming a power in the state. I don't know--but it seems to me there's power enough
in these regions! It's getting crowded. First thing you know, you'll be jealous of Mr. Jefferson,
or he'll be jealous of you. If I were you, I'd look to the West."

"The old song!" exclaimed Rand. "What should I do in the West?"

"Rule it," said Adam.

Rand shot a glance at the hunter where he lounged against the window, a figure straight and
lithe as an Indian, not tall, but gifted with a pantherish grace, and breathing a certain tawny
brightness as of sunshine through pine needles. "You're daft!" he said; then after a moment,
"Are you serious?"

"Why should I not be serious?" asked Adam. "My faith! it's a restless land, the West, and it's
a far cry from the Mississippi to the Potomac. The West doesn't like the East anyhow. But it
wants a picked man from the East. It will get one too! The wind's blowing hard from the full
to the empty, from the parcelled-out to the virgin land!"

"Yes," said Rand.

"Why shouldn't you be the man?" demanded Gaudylock. "Just as well you as Claiborne--Wilkinson's
naught, I don't count him--or any one still East, like--like--Aaron Burr."

"Aaron Burr?"

"Well, I just instance him. He's ambitious enough, and there doesn't seem much room for him
back here. If Adam Gaudylock was ambitious and was anything but just an uneducated hunter with
a taste for danger--I tell you, Lewis, I can see the blazed trees, I can see them with my eyes
shut, stretching clean from anywhere--stretching from this room, say--beyond the Ohio, and
beyond the Mississippi, and beyond Mexico to where the sun strikes the water! It's a trail
for fine treading and a strong man, but it leads--it leads--"

"It might lead," said Rand, "to the Tarpeian Rock."

"Where's that?"

"It's where they put to death a sort of folk called traitors--Benedict Arnolds and such."

"Pshaw!" exclaimed Adam. "Traitors! Benedict Arnold was a traitor. This is not like that. America's
large enough for a mort of countries. All the states are countries--federated countries. Say
some man is big enough to make a country west of the Mississippi--Well, one day we may federate
too. Eh, Lewis, 'twould be a powerful country--great as Rome, I reckon! And we'd smoke the
calumet with old Virginia--and she'd rule East and we'd rule West. D'you think it's a dream?--Well,
men make dreams come true."

"Yes: Corsicans," answered Rand. "Aaron Burr is not a Corsican." He looked at his left hand,
lying upon the arm of his chair, raised it, shut and opened it, gazing curiously at its vein
and sinew. "You are talking midsummer madness," he said at last. "Let's leave the blazed trees
for a while--though we'll talk of them again some time. Have you been along the Three-Notched
Road?"

"Yes," replied Adam, turning easily. "Your tobacco's prime, the wheat, too, and the fencing
is all mended and white-washed. It's not the tumble-down place it was in Gideon's time--you've
done wonders with it. The morning-glories were blooming over the porch, and your white cat
washing itself in the sun."

"It's but a poor home," said Rand, and he said it wistfully. He wished for a splendid house,
a home so splendid that any woman must love it.

"It's not so fine as Fontenoy," quoth Adam, "nor Monticello, nor Mr. Blennerhassett's island
in the Ohio, but a man might be happy in a poorer spot. Home's home, as I can testify who haven't
any. I've known a Cherokee to die of homesickness for a skin stretched between two saplings.
How long before you are back upon the Three-Notched Road?"

Rand moved restlessly. "The doctor says I may go downstairs to-day. I shall leave Fontenoy
almost immediately. They cannot want me here."

"Have you seen Mr. Ludwell Cary?"

"He and his brother left Fontenoy some time ago. But he rides over nearly every day. Usually
I see him."

"He is making a fine place of Greenwood. And he has taken a law office in Charlottesville--the
brick house by the Swan.

"Yes. He told me he would not be idle."

Adam rose, and took up the gun which it was his whim to carry. "I'll go talk ginseng and maple
sugar to Colonel Churchill for a bit, and then I'll go back to the Eagle. As soon as you are
on the Three-Notched Road again I'll come to see you there."

"Adam," said Rand, "in the woods, when chance makes an Indian your host, an Indian of a hostile
tribe, an Indian whom you know the next week may see upon the war-path against you--and there
is in his lodge a thing, no matter what, that you desire with all your mind and all your heart
and all your soul, and he will not barter with you, and the thing is not entirely his own nor
highly valued by him, while it is more than life to you, and moreover you believe it to be
sought by one who is your foe--would you, Adam, having eaten that Indian's bread, go back into
the forest, and leave behind, untouched, unspoken of, that precious thing your soul longed
for? The trail you take may never lead again to that lodge. Would you leave it?"

"Yes," answered Adam. "But my trail should lead that way again. It is a hostile tribe. I would
come back, not in peace paint, but in war paint. I would fairly warn the Indian, and then I
would take the bauble."

"Here is Mammy Chloe," said the other. "What have you there, mammy--a dish of red pottage?"

"No, sah," said Mammy. "Hit's a baked apple an' whipped cream an' nutmeg. Ole Miss she say
Gineral Lafayette sho' did favour baked apples wunst when he wuz laid up wid a cold at her
father's house in Williamsburgh. An' de little posy, Miss Deb she done gather hit outer her
square in de gyarden. De Cun'l he say de fambly gwine expect de honour of yo' company dis evenin'
in de drawin'-room."

Adam said good-bye and went away. An hour later, going down the Fontenoy road, he came upon
a small brown figure, seated, hands over knees, among the blackberry bushes.

"Why, you partridge!" he exclaimed. "You little brown prairie-hen, what are you doing so far
from home? Blackberries aren't ripe."

"No," said Vinie. "I was just a-walking down the road, and I just walked on. I wasn't tired.
I always think the country's prettier down this way. Did you come from Fontenoy, Mr. Adam?"

"Yes," replied Adam, sitting down beside her. "I went to see Lewis Rand--not that I don't like
all the people there anyway. They're always mighty nice to me."

Vinie dug the point of her dusty shoe into the dusty road.

"How ith Mr. Rand, Mr. Adam?"

"He 'ith' almost well," answered Adam. "He's going down into the parlour to-night, and pretty
soon he's going home, and then he'll be riding into town to his office."

He looked kindly into the small, freckled, pretty face. The heat of the day stood in moisture
on Vinie's brow, she had pushed back her sunbonnet, and the breeze stirred the damp tendrils
of her hair. "Tom must miss him," said the hunter.

"Yeth, Tom does." Vinie drew toward her a blackberry branch, and studied the white bloom. "Which
do you think is the prettiest, Mr. Adam,--Miss Unity or Miss Jacqueline?"

"Why, I don't know," answered Adam. "They are both mighty pretty."

"I think Miss Unity's the prettiest," said Vinie. "It's time I was walking back to Charlottesville."
She rose and stood for a moment in the dusty road below the blackberry bushes, looking toward
Fontenoy. "I don't suppose he asked after Tom and me, Mr. Adam?"

"Why, surely!" protested Adam, with cheerful mendacity. "He asked after you both particularly.
He said he certainly would like a cup of water from your well."

"Did he?" asked Vinie, and grew pink. "That water's mighty cold."

"I'd like a cup of it myself," said Adam. "Since we are both walking to town, we might as well
walk together. Don't you want me to break some cherry blossoms for your parlour?"

"Yeth, if you please," replied Vinie, and the two went up the sunny road to Charlottesville.

Back at Fontenoy, in the blue room, Rand, resting in the easy chair beside the window, left
the consideration of Adam and Adam's talk, and gave his mind to the approaching hour in the
Fontenoy drawing-room. He both desired and dreaded that encounter. Would Miss Churchill be
there? Aided by the homely friendliness of her cousin's house on the Three-Notched Road, he
had met her and conversed with her without being greatly conscious of any circumstance other
than that she was altogether beautiful, and that he loved her. But this was not Mrs. Selden's,
this was Fontenoy. He had stood here hat in hand, within Miss Churchill's memory--certainly
within the memory of the men of her family. Well! He was, thank God! an American citizen. The
hat was now out of his hand and upon his head. The conditions of his boyhood might, he thought,
be forgotten in the conditions of his manhood. But--they would all be gathered in the drawing-room.
Should he speak first to Colonel Churchill as his host, or first to the ladies of the house,
to Miss Churchill and Miss Dandridge? If Miss Churchill or Miss Dandridge were at the harpsichord,
should he wait at the door until the piece was ended? He had a vision of a great space of polished
floor reflecting candlelight, and of himself crossing that trackless desert beneath the eyes
of goddesses and men. The colour came into his face. There were twenty things he might have
asked Mr. Pincornet that night at Monticello. He turned with hot impatience from the consideration
of the usages of society, and fell to building with large and strong timbers the edifice of
his future. He built on while the dusk gathered, and he built while Joab helped him to dress,
and he was yet busy with beam and rafter when at eight o'clock, with some help from the negro,
he descended the stairs and crossed the hall to the parlour door. How was he dressed? He was
dressed in a high-collared coat of blue cloth with eagle buttons, in cloth breeches and silk
stockings, in shoes with silver buckles, and a lawn neckcloth of many folds. His hair was innocent
of powder, and cut short in what the period supposed to be the high Roman fashion. It was his
chief touch of the Republican. In the matter of dress he had not his leader's courage. Abhorring
slovenliness and the Jacobin motley, he would not affect them. He was dressed in his best for
this evening; and if his attire was not chosen as Ludwell Cary would have chosen, it was yet
the dress of a gentleman, and it was worn with dignity.

Music was playing, as he paused at the half-open door,--he could see Miss Dandridge at the
harpsichord. The room seemed very light. For a moment he ceased to be the master-builder and
sank to the estate of the apprentice, awkward and eaten with self-distrust; the next, with
a characteristic abrupt motion of head and hand, he recovered himself, waved Joab aside, and
boldly crossed the threshold.

Unity, at the harpsichord, was playing over, very rapidly, one after another, reels, hornpipes,
jigs, and Congos, and looking, meanwhile, slyly out of velvet eyes at Fairfax Cary, who had
asked for a particularly tender serenade. He stood beside her, and strove for injured dignity.
It was a day of open courtship, and polite Albemarle watched with admiration the younger Cary's
suit to Miss Dandridge. He had ridden alone to Fontenoy; his brother, who had business in Charlottesville,
promising to join him later in the evening. Mr. Ned Hunter, too, was at Fontenoy, and he also
would have been leaning over the harpsichord but for the fact that Colonel Dick had fastened
upon him and was demonstrating with an impressive forefinger the feasibility of widening into
a highway fit for a mail-coach a certain forest track running over the mountains and through
the adjoining county. They stood upon the hearth, and Mr. Hunter could see Miss Dandridge only
by much craning of the neck. "Yes, yes," he said vaguely, "it can easily be widened, sir."

Major Churchill, playing Patience at the small table, raised his head like a war-horse. "Nonsense!
widen on one side and you will fall into the river; on the other, and a pretty cliff you'll
have to climb! You could as well widen the way between Scylla and Charybdis--or Mahomet's Bridge
to Paradise--or Thomas Jefferson's Natural Bridge! Pshaw!" He began to build from the five
of clubs.

"A detour can be made," said Colonel Dick.

"Around the Blue Ridge?" asked the Major scornfully. "Pshaw! And it passes my comprehension
what a stage-coach would do in that country. There are not ten houses on that cart track."

"Nonsense! there are fifty."

"Fifty-three, I assure you, sir."

The Major laid down his cards and turned in his chair. "I counted every structure the last
time I was on that road. Taking in Fagg's Mill and Brown's Ferry and the Mountain Schoolhouse,
there are just ten houses. It is my habit, sir, to reckon accurately."

Mr. Hunter grew red. "But, sir, the count was taken before the last election, and fifty-three--"

"Ten, sir!" said the Major, and placed the queen of diamonds.

"When did you ride that way, Edward?" queried his brother. "I don't believe you've been across
the mountain since the war."

"I was on that road in '87," said the Major. "I rode that way on the sixth of April with Clark.
And there are ten houses; I counted them."

"But good Lord, sir, this is 1804!"

The Major's hawk eyes, dark and bright beneath shaggy brows, regarded Mr. Ned Hunter with disfavour.
"I am aware, sir, that this is 1804," he said, and placed the king of diamonds.

Jacqueline arose from her chair beside the open window, softly crossed the floor, and touched
Colonel Churchill upon the arm. "Uncle Dick," she murmured, and with the slightest of gestures
indicated Rand standing in the door.

Colonel Churchill started, precipitantly left Mr. Hunter, and crossed the floor to his guest
of two weeks. "My dear sir, you came in so quietly! I welcome you downstairs. Gilmer says you're
a strong fighter. When I was thrown at that same turn coming home from a wedding, I believe
I was in bed for a month!--Allow me to present you to my nieces--Miss Churchill, Miss Dandridge.
My poor wife, you know, never leaves her chamber. Mr. Ned Hunter, Mr. Rand. Mr. Fairfax Cary
I think you know, and my brother Edward."

The young men's greeting, if somewhat constrained, was courteous. Major Churchill played the
card which he held in his hand, then slowly rose, came stiffly from behind the small table,
and made an elaborate bow. There was in his acknowledgment of the honour of Mr. Rand's acquaintance
so much accent, cruelty, and hauteur that the younger man flushed. "This is an enemy," said
a voice within him. He bowed in return, and he no longer felt any distrust of himself. When
Miss Dandridge, leaving the harpsichord, established herself upon the sofa before him and opened
a lively fire of questions and comment, he answered with readiness. He thought her pretty figure
in amber lutestring, and the turn of her ringleted head, and the play of her scarlet lips all
very good to look at, and he looked without hesitation. The account which she demanded of the
accident which had placed him there he gave with a free, bold, and pleasing touch, and the
thanks that were her due as the immediate Samaritan he chivalrously paid. Unity made friends
with all parties, and she now found, with some amusement, that she was going to like Lewis Rand.

Rand looked too, freely and quietly, at the young men, his fellow guests. Each, he knew, was
arrogantly impatient of his presence there. Well, they had nothing to do with it! His sense
of humour awoke, and Federalist hauteur ceased to fret him. Colonel Churchill, the most genial
of men, pushed his chair into the Republican's neighbourhood, and plunged into talk. Conversation
in Virginia, where men were concerned, opened with politics, crops, or horseflesh. Colonel
Dick chose the second, and Rand, who had a first-hand knowledge of the subject, met him in
the fields. The trinity of corn, wheat, and tobacco occupied them for a while, as did the fruit
and an experiment in vine-growing. The horse then entered the conversation, and Rand asked
after Goldenrod, that had won the cup at Fredericksburg. "I broke him for you, you know, sir,
seven years ago."

Colonel Churchill, who in his own drawing-room would not for the world have mentioned this
little fact to his guest, suddenly thought within his honest heart, "This is a man, even if
he is a damned Republican!" He gave a circumstantial account of Goldenrod, and of Goldenrod's
brother, Firefly, and he said to himself, "I'll keep off politics." Presently Rand began to
speak of Adam Gaudylock's account of New Orleans.

"Ay, ay," said the Colonel, "there's a city! But it's not English--it is Spanish and French.
And all that new land now! 'twill never be held--begging your pardon, Mr. Rand--by Thomas Jefferson
and a lot of new-fangled notions! No Spaniard ever did believe that all men are born equal,
and no Frenchman ever wanted liberty long--not unadorned liberty, anyway. As for our own people
who are pouring over the mountains--well, English blood naturally likes pride and power and
what was good enough for its grandparents! Louisiana is too big and too far away. It takes
a month to go from Washington to New Orleans. Rome couldn't keep her countries that were far
away, and Rome believed in armies and navies and proper taxation, and had no pernicious notions--begging
your pardon again, Mr. Rand--about free trade and the abolishment of slavery! I tell you, this
new country of ours will breed or import a leader--and then she'll revolt and make him dictator--and
then we'll have an empire for neighbour, an empire without any queasy ideas as to majorities
and natural rights! And Thomas Jefferson--begging your pardon, Mr. Rand--is acute enough to
see the danger. He's not bothering about majorities and natural rights either--for the country
west of the Ohio! He's preparing to govern the Mississippi Territory like a conquered province.
Mark my words, Mr. Rand, she'll find a Buonaparte--some young demagogue, some ambitious upstart
without scruple or a hostage to fortune some common soldier like Buonaparte or favourite like--like--"

"Like--" queried Rand. But the Colonel, who had suddenly grown very red, would not or could
not continue his comparison. He floundered, drew out his snuff-box and restored it to his pocket,
and finally was taken pity on by Unity, who with dancing eyes reëntered the conversation, and
asked if Mr. Rand had read The Romance of the Forest. Fairfax Cary left the harpsichord, where
he had been impatiently turning over the music, and, strolling to one of the long windows,
stood now looking out into the gloomy night, and now staring with a frowning face at the lit
room and at Miss Dandridge, in her amber gown, smiling upon Lewis Rand! Near him, Major Churchill,
preternaturally grey and absorbed, played Patience. The cards fell from his hand with the sound
of dead leaves. Beside a second window sat Jacqueline, looking, too, into the night. She sat
in a low chair covered with dull green silk, and the straight window curtains, of the same
colour and texture, half enshadowed her. Her dress was white, with coral about her throat and
in her hair. She leaned her elbow on her knee, and with her chin in her hand looked upon the
dark mass of the trees, and the stars between the hurrying clouds.

The younger Cary, at his window, leaned out into the night, listened a moment, then turned
and left the room. "It is my brother, sir," he announced, as he passed Colonel Churchill. "I
hear him at the gate."

Ten minutes later Ludwell Cary entered. He was in riding-dress, his handsome face a little
worn and pale, but smiling, his bearing as usual, quiet, manly, and agreeable. "It is a sultry
night, sir," he said to Colonel Churchill. "There is a storm brewing.--Miss Dandridge, your
very humble servant!--Mr. Rand--" He held out his hand. "I am rejoiced to see you recovered!"

Rand stood up, and touched the extended hand. "Thank you," he said, with a smile. "I were a
Turk if I did not recover here amidst all this goodness."

"Yes, yes, there's goodness," answered Cary, and moved on to the window where Jacqueline sat
in the shadow of the curtains. Rand, looking after him, saw him speak to her, and saw her answer
with a smile.

A pang ran through him, acrid and fiery. It was not like the vapour of distaste and dislike,
of which he had been conscious on the day of the election. That had been cold and clinging;
this was a burning and a poisoned arrow. It killed the softening, the consciousness of charm,
the spell of Cary's kindness while he lay there helpless in the blue room. Not since the old
days when his heart was hot against his father, had he felt such venom, such rancour. That
had been a boy's wild revolt against injustice; this passion was the fury of the adolescent
who sees his rival. He looked at Cary through a red mist. This cleared, but a seed that was
in Rand's nature, buried far, far down in the ancestral earth, swelled a little where it lay
in its dim chasm. The rift closed, the glow as of heated iron faded, and Rand bitterly told
himself, "He will win; more than that, he deserves to win! As for you, you are here to behave
like a gentleman." He turned more fully to Unity, and talked of books and of such matters as
he thought might be pleasing to a lady.

Fairfax Cary entered, brushing the drops from his coat-sleeve. "The rain is coming down," he
said, and with deliberation seated himself beside Miss Dandridge.

"That's good!" exclaimed the Colonel. "Now things will grow!--Jacqueline, child, aren't you
going to sing to us?"

Jacqueline rose, left the window, and went to her harp, Cary following her. She drew the harp
toward her, then raised her clear face. "What shall I sing?" she asked.

Cary, struck by a note in her voice, glanced at her quickly where she now sat, full in the
light of the candles. She had no colour ordinarily, but to-night the fine pale brown of her
face was tinged with rose. Her eyes were lustrous. As she spoke she drew her hands across the
strings, and there followed a sound, faint, far, and sweet. Cary wondered. He was not a vain
man, nor over-sanguine, but he wondered, "Is the brightness for me?" The colour came into his
own cheek, and a vigour touched him from head to heel. "I don't care what you sing!" he said.
"Your songs are all the sweetest ever written. Sing To Althea!"

She sang. Rand watched her from the distance--the hands and the white arm seen behind the gold
strings, the slender figure in a gown of filmy white, the warm, bare throat pouring melody,
the face that showed the soul within.

Through the window came the sound of rain, the smell of wet box and of damask roses. Now and
then the lightning flashed, showing the garden and the white bloom of locust trees.

     "Minds innocent and quiet take
       That for a hermitage."

Rand's heart ached with passionate longing, passionate admiration. He thought that the voice
to which he listened, the voice that brooded and dreamed, for all that it was so angel-sweet,
would reach him past all the iron bars of time or of eternity. He thought that when he came
to die he would wish to die listening to it. The voice sang to him like an angel voice singing
to Ishmael in the wilderness.

The song came to an end, but after a moment Jacqueline sang again, sonorous and passionate
words of a lover to his mistress. It was not now the Cavalier hymning of constancy; it was
the Elizabethan breathing passion, and his cry was the more potent.

     "The thirst that from the soul doth rise
       Doth ask a drink divine"--

Blinding lightning, followed by a tremendous crash, startled the singer from her harp and brought
all in the room to their feet. "That struck!" exclaimed the Colonel. "Look out, Fairfax, and
see if 't was the stables! I hear the dogs howling.

"'Twas the big pine by the gate, I think, sir," answered Fairfax Cary, half in and half out
of the window. "Gad! it is black!"

"You two cannot go home to-night," cried Colonel Churchill, with satisfaction. "And here's
Cato with the decanters! We might have a hand at Loo--eh, Unity? you and Fairfax, Ned Hunter
and I.--The card-table, Cato!"

The four sat down, the card-table being so placed as to quite divide Jacqueline and Ludwell
Cary, at the harp, from Major Edward's small table and Rand beside the sofa. "Edward!" said
the Colonel. His brother nodded, gathered up his cards, and turned squarely to the entertainment
of the Republican. "So, Mr. Rand, Mr. Monroe goes to Spain! What the Devil is he going to do
there? I wish that your party, sir, would send Mr. Madison to Turkey and Colonel Burr to the
Barbary States! And what, may I ask, are you going to do with the Mississippi now that you've
got it? It's a damned expensive business buying from Buonaparte. Sixty millions for a casus
belli! That's what you have paid, and that's what you have acquired, sir!"

"I don't think you can be certain that it's a casus belli, sir--"

"Sir," retorted the Major, "I may not know much, but what I know, I know damned well! You cry
peace, but there'll be no peace. There'll be war, sir, war, war, war!"

Unity glanced from the card-table. "Sing again, Jacqueline, do! Sing something peaceful," and
Jacqueline, still with a colour and with shining eyes, laughed, struck a sounding chord, and
in her noble contralto sang Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled.

CHAPTER XI

IN THE GARDEN

In the forenoon of the next day Rand closed, for the second time that morning, the door of
the blue room behind him, descended the stairs, and, passing through the quiet house, went
out into the flower garden. He was going away that afternoon. Breakfast had been taken in his
own room, but afterward, with some dubitation, he had gone downstairs. There Colonel Churchill
met him heartily enough, but presently business with his overseer had taken the Colonel away.
Rand found himself cornered by Major Edward and drawn into a discussion of the impeachment
of Judge Chase. Rand could be moved to the blackest rage, but he had no surface irritability
of temper. To his antagonists his self-command was often maddening. Major Churchill was as
disputatious as Arthur Lee, and an adept at a quarrel, but the talk of the impeachment went
tamely on. The Republican would not fight at Fontenoy, and at last the Major in a cold rage
went away to the library--first, however, watching the young man well on his way up the stairs
and toward the blue room. But Rand had not stayed in the blue room. Restless and unhappy, the
garden, viewed through his window, invited him. He thought: "I'll walk in it once again; I'll
find the summer-house where I sat beside her," and he had acted upon his impulse. No one was
about. Within and without, the house seemed lapped in quiet. He had been given to understand
that the ladies were busy with household matters, and he believed the Carys to have ridden
to Greenwood. That afternoon he would mount Selim, and with Joab would go home to the house
on the Three-Notched Road.

After the rain of the night before the garden was cool and sweet. The drops yet lay on the
tangle of old-fashioned flowers, on the box and honeysuckle and the broad leaves of the trees
where all the birds were singing. The gravel paths were wet and shining. Rand walked slowly,
here and there, between the lines of box or under arching boughs, his mind now trying to bring
back the day when he had walked there as a boy, now wondering with a wistful passion if he
was to leave Fontenoy without again seeing Jacqueline. He meant to leave without one word that
the world might not hear, but he thought it hard that he must go without a touch of the hand,
without a "From my heart I thank you for your kindness. Good-bye, good-bye!" That would not
be much; Fontenoy might give him that.

He reached an edge of the garden where a thread-like stream trickled under a bank of periwinkle,
phlox, and ivy, and on through a little wood of cedars. The air was cool beneath the trees,
and Rand raised his forehead to the blowing wind. The narrow pathway turned, and he came upon
Deb and Miranda seated upon the bare, red earth and playing with flower dolls.

Deb had before her a parade of morning-glories, purple and white, pink and blue, while Miranda
sat in a ring of marigolds and red columbines. Each was slowly swaying to and fro, murmuring
to herself, and manipulating with small, darting fingers her rainbow throng of ladies. Rand,
unseen, watched the manoeuvres for a while, then coughed to let them know he was there, and
presently sat down upon a root of cedar, and gave Deb his opinion of the flower people. Children
and he were always at their ease together.

"Hollyhocks make the finest ladies," he announced gravely. "Little Miss Randolph puts snapdragon
caps upon them and gives them scarfs of ribbon grass."

"Hollyhocks are not in bloom," said Deb. "I use snapdragon for caps, too.--Now she has on a
red and gold cap. This is a currant-leaf shawl."

"Do you name them?" asked Rand, poising a columbine upon the back of his hand.

"Of course," answered Deb. "All people have names. That is Sapphira."

Miranda advanced a flourishing zinnia. "Dishyer Miss Keren-Happuch--Marse Job's daughter."

Deb regarded with shining eyes a pale blue morning-glory with a little cap of white. "This
is Ruth--I love her! The dark one is Hagar--she was dark, you know--and those two are Rachel
and Leah."

"Ol' Miss Babylon!" said Miranda succinctly, and put forth a many-petalled red lady.

     "Babylon, Babylon,
     Red an' sinnin' Babylon,
     Wash her han's in Jordan flood,
     Still she's sinnin' Babylon!"

"And, these three?" asked Rand.

"Faith, Hope, and Charity," answered Deb. "Faith is blue, Hope is pink, and that white one
is Charity."

"She has a purple edge to her gown."

"Yes," said Deb, "and I am going to give her a crown, 'for the greatest of these is Charity!'
That yellow lily is the Shulamite. Miranda and I are going now to gather more ladies." She
looked at Rand with large child's eyes. "If you want somebody to talk to, my sister Jacqueline
is reading over there in the summer-house."

The blood rushed to Rand's face. His heart beat so loud and fast that it stifled a voice within
him. He did not even hear the voice. He rose at once, turned, and took the path that Deb's
brown finger indicated. Had he been another man, had he been, perhaps, Ludwell Cary, he might
not have gone. But he was Lewis Rand, the product and effect of causes inherited and self-planted,
and his passion, rising suddenly, mastered him with a giant's grip. The only voice that he
heard was the giant's urgent cry, and he went without protest.

The summer-house was a small, latticed place, overgrown with the Seven Sisters rose, and set
in a breast-high ring of box opening here and there to the garden paths. A tulip tree towered
above the gravel space before it, and two steps led to a floor chequered with light and shade,
and to a rustic chair and table. Jacqueline was not within the summer-house; she sat in the
doorway, upon the step. She was not reading. She sat bowed together, her head upon her folded
arms, a figure still and tragic as a sphinx or sibyl. Rand's eyes upon her roused her from
her brooding. She lifted her head, saw him, and her face, which had been drawn and weary, became
like the face of the young dawn.

As Rand crossed the space between them, she rose. He saw the colour and the light, and he uttered
only her name--"Jacqueline, Jacqueline!" A moment, and they were in each other's arms.

It was their golden hour. Neither thought of right or wrong, of the conditions of life beyond
their ring of box, of wisdom or its contrary. It was as though they had met in the great void
of space, the marvel called man and the wonder that is woman, each drawn to each over the endless
fields and through the immeasurable ages. Each saw the other transfigured, and each wished
for lover and companion the other shining one.

They moved to the summer-house, and sat down upon the step. About them was the Seven Sisters
rose, and above towered the tulip tree with a mockingbird singing in its branches. The place
was filled with the odour of the box. To the end of their lives the smell of box brought back
that hour in the Fontenoy garden. The green walls hid from view all without their little round.
They had not heard step or voice when suddenly, having strolled that way by accident, there
emerged from the winding path into the space about the summer-house Colonel Churchill and Ludwell
Cary. There was a second's utter check, then, "Sir!" cried the Colonel, in wrathful amazement.

The hands of the lovers fell apart. Rand rose, but Jacqueline sat still, looking at her uncle
with a paling cheek and a faint line between her brows. The mockingbird sang on, but the garden
appeared to darken and grow cold. The place seemed filled with difficult breathing. Then, before
a word was spoken, Cary turned, made a slight gesture with his hand, and went away, disappearing
between the lines of box. The sound of his footsteps died in the direction of the stream and
the dark wood. Colonel Churchill moistened his lips and spoke in a thick voice. "You scoundrel!
Was it for this? You are a scoundrel, sir!"

"I have asked Miss Churchill to be my wife," said Rand, with steadiness. "She has consented.
I love your niece, sir, with all my heart, most truly, most dearly! I will ask you to believe
that it was not in my mind to speak to her to-day, or to speak at all without your knowledge.
I confess the impropriety of my course. But we met unawares. It is not to be helped. In no
way is she to blame."

Jacqueline rose, came to her uncle, and tried to take his hand. He repulsed her. "Is this true--what
this man says?"

"Yes, yes," said Jacqueline. "It is true. Oh, forgive him!"

The Colonel struck down her outstretched hands. "I do not believe you are Henry's child! Your
mother was a strange woman. You are not a Churchill. My God! Henry's child talking of marrying
this--this--this gentleman. You are mad, or I am mad. Come away from him, Jacqueline!"

"I love him!" cried Jacqueline. "Oh, Uncle Dick, Uncle Dick!--"

"I loved your niece, sir, when I was a boy," said Rand; "and I love her now that I am a man.
I grant that I should not have spoken to her to-day. I ask your pardon for what may seem to
you insult and thanklessness. But the thing itself--is it so impossible? Why is it impossible
that I should wed where I love with all my heart?" He broke a piece of the box beside him and
drew it through his hands, then threw it away, and squarely faced the elder man. "I had my
way to make in life. Well, I am making it fast. I am making it faster, perhaps, than any other
man in the county, be he who he may! I am poor, but I am not so poor as once I was, and I shall
be richer yet. My want of wealth is perhaps the least--why should I not say that I know it
is the least objection in your mind? My party? Well, I shall become a leader of my party--and
Republicans are white as well as Federalists. It is not forgery or murder to detest Pitt and
George the Third, or to believe in France! Is it so poor a thing to become a leader of a party
that has gained an empire, that has put an end to the Algerine piracy, that has reduced the
debt, that has made easier every man's condition, and that stands for freedom of thought and
deed and advance of all knowledge? Party! Now and then, even in Virginia, there is a marriage
between the parties! My family--or my lack of family? The fact that my father rolled tobacco,
and that now and then I broke a colt for you?" He smiled. "Well, you must allow that I broke
them thoroughly--and Goldenrod was a very demon! Pshaw! This is America, and once we had an
ideal! For the rest, though I do not go to church, I believe in God, and though I have been
called an unscrupulous lawyer, I take no dirty money. Some say that I am a demagogue--I think
that they are wrong. I love your niece, sir, and more than that--oh, much more than that!--she
says that she loves me. She says that she will share my life. If I make not that sharing sweet
to her, then indeed--But I will! I will give her wealth and name and place, and a heart to
keep. Again I say that the fault of this meeting is all mine. I humbly beg your pardon, Colonel
Churchill, and I beg your consent to my marriage with your niece--"

The Colonel, who had heard so far in stormy silence, broke in with, "Marry my niece, sir! I
had rather see my niece dead and laid in her grave! Consent! I'd as soon consent to her death
or dishonour! Name and place! you neither have them nor will have them!" He turned upon Jacqueline.
"I'll forgive you," he said, breathing heavily, "there in the library, when you have written
and signed a letter to Mr. Lewis Rand explaining that both he and you were mistaken in your
sentiments towards him. I'll forgive you then, and I'll do my best to forget. But not else,
Jacqueline, not else on God's earth! That's sworn. As for you, sir, I should think that your
awakened sense of propriety might suggest--"

"I am going, sir," answered Rand. "I return to the house but to take my papers from the blue
room. Joab shall saddle my horse at once. You shall not anger me, Colonel Churchill. I owe
you too much. But your niece has said that she will be my wife, and before God, she shall be!
And that's sworn, too, sir! I leave Fontenoy at once, as is just, but I shall write to your
niece. Part us you cannot--"

"Jacqueline," cried the Colonel, "the sight of you there beside that man is death to my old
heart. You used to care--you used to be a good child! I command you to leave him; I command
you to say good-bye to him now, at once and forever! Tell him that you have been dreaming,
but that now you are awake. God knows that I think that I am dreaming! Come, come, my little Jack!"

"Will you tell me that?" asked Rand. "Will you tell me that, Jacqueline?"

"No!" cried Jacqueline; "I will tell you only the truth! I love you--love you. Oh, my heart,
my heart!" She turned from them both, sank down upon the summer-house step, and lay with her
forehead on her arm.

There was a moment's silence, then, "You see," said Rand, not without gentleness, to the elder man.

Colonel Churchill leaned on his walking-stick, and his breath came heavily. He wondered where
Edward was--Edward could always find words that would hurt. At last, "We part, Mr. Rand," he
said, with dignity. "In parting I have but to say that your conduct has been such as I might
have expected, and that I conceive it to be my duty to protect my misguided niece from the
consequences of her folly. I warn you neither to write to her nor to attempt to see her. If
she writes to you otherwise than as I shall dictate; if she does not, when she has bethought
herself, break with you once and forever,--all's over between us! She is no niece of mine.
She is dead to me. I'll not speak to her, nor willingly look upon her face again. I am a man
of my word. I have the honour, sir, to bid you a very good-day." He drew out and looked at
his ponderous watch. "I shall remain here with my niece for an hour. Perhaps in that time she
will awaken to her old truth, her old duty; and perhaps you will require no more in which to
gather your papers and remove yourself from Fontenoy?"

"I shall not need the hour," answered Rand. "I will be gone presently. God knows, sir, I had
not thought to go this way." He turned from his host and bent for a moment over Jacqueline.
"Good-bye," he said. "Good-bye for a little while! My heart is in your hands. I trust you for
constancy. Good-bye--good-bye!"

He was gone, moving rapidly toward the house. Colonel Churchill drew a long sigh, wiped his
face with his handkerchief, and looked miserably up to the green boughs where the mockingbird
was singing. He wished again for Edward, and he wished that Henry had not died. He believed
in Heaven, and he knew that Henry was there, but then the thought came into his mind that Henry
was here, too, in the person of his child, prone on the summer-house steps. Henry, also, had
been a man of his word, had known his own mind, and exercised his will. There, too, had been
the veil of sweetness! The Colonel sighed more heavily, wished again impatiently for Edward,
then marched to the summer-house, and, sitting down, began to reason with Henry's daughter.

Rand passed through the Fontenoy garden, in his heart a pain that was triumph, an exaltation
that was pain. Mounting the porch steps, he found himself in the presence of Major Edward playing
Patience in the shade of the climbing rose. The player started violently. "I thought, sir,"
he said, wheeling in his chair, "I thought you yet in the blue room! How the deuce!--I was
on guard--" the Major caught himself. "I was waiting to renew our very interesting discussion.
Where have you been?"

"I have been in the garden," said Rand. He hesitated, standing by the table. There was a debate
in his mind. "Should I speak to him, too? What is the use? He'll be no kinder to her!" He put
out his hand uncertainly, and touched one of the Major's cards. "Is it an interesting game?"

"I find it so," answered the other dryly. "Else I should not play it."

"Why do you like it? It is poor amusement to play against yourself."

"I like it, sir," snapped the Major, "because I am assured of playing against a gentleman."

Rand let his hand fall from the table. "Major Churchill, I am leaving Fontenoy immediately.
Perhaps I ought to tell you what I have just told your brother: I love Miss Churchill--"

The Major rose from his chair. "Have you spoken to her?"

"Yes, I have asked her to marry me."

"Indeed!" said the Major huskily. "May I ask what Miss Churchill replied?"

"Miss Churchill loves me," answered Rand. "She will do what I wish."

The silence grew painful. The words, acid and intolerable, that Rand expected, did not seem
to come easily to the Major's dry lips. He looked small, thin, and frozen, grey and drawn of
face, as though the basilisk had confronted him. When at last he spoke, it was in a curiously
remote voice, lucid and emotionless. "Well, why not? All beliefs die--die and rot! A vain show--and
this, too, was of the charnel!"

He turned upon Rand as if he would have struck him, then drew back, made in the air an abrupt
and threatening gesture, and with a sound like a stifled cry passed the other and entered the
house. Rand heard him go down the hall, and the closing of the library door.

The young man's heart was hot and sore. He went up to the blue room, where he found Joab packing
his portmanteau. A few peremptory words sent the man to the stables, while his master with
rapid fingers collected and laid together the papers with which the room was strewn. The task
finished, he threw himself for a moment into the great chair and looked about him. He was capable
of great attachment to place, and he had loved this room. Now the mandarin smiled obliquely
on him, and the moon-clock ticked the passing moments, the impossible blue roses flowered on
thornless stems, and the picture of Washington looked calmly down from the opposite wall. He
put his hand over his eyes, and sat still, trying to calm the storm within him. There were
in his mind joy and gratitude, hurt pride and bitter indignation, and a thousand whirling thoughts
as to ways and means, the overcoming of obstacles, and the building of a palace fit to shelter
his happiness. The clock struck, and he started up. Not for much would he have overstayed his hour.

He left the room and passed through the silent house, mounted his horse, and rode away. A crowd
had witnessed his arrival there; only a few wondering servants were gathered to see him depart.
He gave them gold, but though they thanked him, they thanked him with a difference. He felt
it, and that more keenly than he might have felt a greater thing. Could he not even give largesse
like one to the manner born, or was it only that all the air was hostile? He rode away. From
the saddle he could have seen the distant summer-house, but he forced himself not to look.
The lawn fell away behind him, and the trees hid the house. The gleam of a white pillar kept
with him for a while, but the driveway bent, and that too was hidden. With Joab behind him
on the iron grey, he passed through the lower gate, and took the way that led to Mrs. Jane
Selden's on the Three-Notched Road.

CHAPTER XII

A MARRIAGE AT SAINT MARGARET'S

"Yes," said Unity. "That is just what the Argus says. 'On Thursday M. Jérôme Buonaparte, the
younger brother of the First Consul, passed through Annapolis with his bride--lately the lively
and agreeable Miss Elizabeth Patterson of Baltimore. M. Buonaparte's Secretary and Physician
followed in a chaise, and the valets and femmes-de-chambre in a coach. The First Consul's brother
wore--' I protest I don't care what the First Consul's brother wore! The Argus is not gallant.
If you were the First Consul's brother--"

"The Argus should describe the bride's dress, not mine," said Fairfax Cary. "How lovely you
would look, in that gown you have on, in a curricle drawn by grey horses! What is the stuff--roses
and silver?"

"Heigho!" sighed Unity. "'Tis a bridesmaid's gown. I am out with men. I shall never wear a
bride's gown."

"Don't jest--"

"Jest! I never felt less like jesting! I laugh to keep from crying. Here is the coach."

The great Fontenoy coach with the Churchill arms on the panel drew up before the porch. It
was drawn by four horses, and driven by old Philip in a wig and nosegay. Mingo was behind,
and Phyllis's Jim and a little darky ran alongside to open the door and let down the steps.
"All alone in that!" exclaimed Cary. "I shall ride with you as far as the old road to Greenwood.
Don't say no! I'll hold your flowers."

Unity looked down upon the roses in her arms. "They should all be white," she said. "I feel
as though I were going to see them bury Jacqueline." Her voice broke, but she bit her lip,
forced back the tears, and tried to laugh. "I'm not. I'm going to her wedding--and people know
their own business best--and she may be as happy as the day is long! He is fascinating,--he
is dreadfully fascinating,--and we have no right to say he is not good--and everybody knows
he is going to be great! Why shouldn't she be happy?"

"I don't know," answered Cary. "But I know she won't be."

"You say that," cried Unity, turning on him, "because you are a Federalist! Well, women are
neither Federalists nor Republicans! They have no party and no soul of their own! They are
just what the person they love is--"

"That's not so," said Cary.

"Oh, I know it's not so!" agreed Miss Dandridge, with impatience. "It's just one of those things
that are said! But it remains that Jacqueline must be happy. I'll break my heart if she's not!
And as long as I live, I'll say that Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward are to blame--"

"Where are they?"

"Oh, Uncle Dick is in the long field watching the threshing, and Uncle Edward is in the library
reading Swift! And Aunt Nancy has ordered black scarfs to be put above the pictures of Uncle
Henry and of Great-Aunt Jacqueline that Jacqueline's named for. Oh, oh!"

"And Deb?" asked the young man gently.

"Deb is at Cousin Jane Selden's. She has been there with Jacqueline a week--she and Miranda.
Oh, I know--Uncle Dick is a just man! He does what he thinks is the just thing. Deb shall go
visit her sister--every now and then! And all that Uncle Henry left Jacqueline goes with her--there
are slaves and furniture and plate, and she has money, too. The Rands don't usually marry so
well--There! I, too, am bitter! But Uncle Dick swears that he will never see Jacqueline again--and
all the Churchills keep their word. Oh, family quarrels! Deb's coming back to Fontenoy to-morrow--poor
little chick! Aunt Nancy's got to have those mourning scarfs taken away before she comes!"

Miss Dandridge descended the porch steps to the waiting coach. The younger Cary handed her
in with great care of her flowers and gauzy draperies, and great reluctance in relinquishing
her hand. "I may come too?" he asked, "just as far as the old Greenwood road? I hate to see
you go alone."

"Oh, yes, yes!" answered Miss Dandridge absently, and, sinking into a corner, regarded through
the window the July morning. "Those black scarfs hurt me," she said, and the July morning grew
misty. "It's not death to marry the man one loves!"

The coach rolled down the drive to the gate, and out upon the sunny road. The dust rose in
clouds, whitening the elder, the stickweed, and the blackberry bushes. The locusts shrilled
in the parching trees. The sky was cloudless and intensely blue, marked only by the slow circling
of a buzzard far above the pine-tops. There were many pines, and the heat drew out their fragrance,
sharp and strong. The moss that thatched the red banks was burned, and all the ferns were shrivelling
up. Everywhere butterflies fluttered, lizards basked in the sun, and the stridulation of innumerable
insects vexed the ear. The way was long, and the coach lumbered heavily through the July weather.
"I do not want to talk," sighed Unity. "My heart is too heavy."

"My own is not light," said Cary grimly. "I am sorry for my brother."

"We are all sorry for your brother," Unity answered gently, and then would speak no more, but
sat in her silver and roses, looking out into the heat and light. The Greenwood road was reached
in silence. Cary put his head out of the window and called to old Philip. The coach came slowly
to a stop before a five-barred gate. Mingo opened the door, and the young man got out. "Unless
you think I might go with you as far as the church--" he suggested, with his hand on the door.
Unity shook her head. "You can't do that, you know! Besides, I am going first to Cousin Jane
Selden's. Good-bye. Oh, it is going to be a happy marriage--it must be happy!"

"What is going to make it happy?" demanded Cary gloomily. "It's a match against nature! When
I think of your cousin in that old whitewashed house, and every night Gideon Rand's ghost making
tobacco around it! I am glad that Ludwell has gone to Richmond. He looks like a ghost himself."

"Oh, the world!" sighed Unity. "Tell Philip, please, to drive on."

"I'll ride over to Fontenoy to-morrow," said Fairfax Cary. "'Twill do you good to talk it over."

The coach went heavily on through the dust of the Three-Notched Road. The locusts shrilled,
the pines gave no shade, in the angle of the snake fences pokeberry and sumach drooped their
dusty leaves. The light air in the pine-tops sounded like the murmur of a distant sea, too
far off for coolness. Unity sighed with the oppression of it all. The flowers were withering
in her lap. After a long hour the road turned, discovering yellow wheat-fields and shady orchards,
the gleam of a shrunken stream and a brick house embowered in wistaria. Around the horse-block
and in the shade of a great willow were standing a coach or two, a chaise, and several saddle-horses.
"All of them Republican," commented Unity.

At the door she was met by Cousin Jane Selden herself, a thin and dark old lady with shrewd
eyes and a determined chin. "I'm glad to see you, Unity, though I should have been more glad
to see Richard and Edward Churchill! 'Woe to a stiff-necked generation!' says the Bible. Well!
you are fine enough, child, and I honour you for it! There are a few people in the parlour--just
those who go to church with us. The clock has struck, and we'll start in half an hour. Jacqueline
is in her room, and when she doesn't look like an angel she looks like her mother. You had
best go upstairs. Mammy Chloe dressed her."

Unity mounted the dark, polished stairs to an upper hall where stood a tall clock and a spindle-legged
table with a vast jar of pot-pourri. A door opened, framing Jacqueline, dressed in white, and
wearing her mother's wedding veil. "I knew your step," she said. "Oh, Unity, you are good to come!"

In the bedroom they embraced. "Wild horses couldn't have kept me from coming!" declared Unity
with resolute gaiety. "Whichever married first, the other was to be bridesmaid!--we arranged
that somewhere in the dark ages! Oh, Jacqueline, you are like a princess in a picture-book!"

"And Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward?" asked Jacqueline, in a low voice.

"Well, the Churchills are obstinate folk, as we all know!" answered Unity cheerfully. "But
I think time will help. They can't go on hating forever. Uncle Dick is in the fields, and Uncle
Edward is in the library reading. There, there, honey!"

Mammy Chloe bore down upon them from the other end of the room. "Miss Unity, don' you mek my
chile cry on her weddin' mahnin'! Hit ain't lucky to cry befo' de ring's on!"

"I'm not crying, Mammy," said Jacqueline. "I wish that I could cry. It is you, Unity, that
are like a princess in your rose and silver, with your dear red lips, and your dear black eyes!
Isn't she lovely, Mammy?" She came close to her cousin and pinned a small brooch in the misty
folds above the white bosom. "This is my gift--it is mother's pearl brooch. Oh, Unity, don't
think too ill of me!"

"Think ill!" cried Unity, with spirit. "I think only good of you. I think you are doing perfectly
right! I'll wear your pearl always--you were always like a pearl to me!"

"Even pearls have a speck at heart," said Jacqueline. "And there's nothing perfectly right--or
perfectly wrong. But most things cannot be helped. Some day, perhaps, at home--at Fontenoy--they
will think of the time when they were young--and in love." She turned and took up her gloves
from the dressing-table. "I have had a letter from Ludwell Cary," she said, then spoke over
her shoulder with sudden lire. "He is the only one of all I know, the only one of all my people,
who has been generous enough, and just enough, to praise the man I marry!"

"Oh, Jacqueline!" cried Unity, "I will praise him to the skies, if only he will make you happy!
Does not every one say that he has a great future? and surely he deserves all credit for rising
as he has done--and he is most able--"

"And good," said Jacqueline proudly. "Don't praise him any more, Unity." She put her hands
on her cousin's shoulders and kissed her lightly on the forehead. "Now and then, my dear, will
you come to see me on the Three-Notched Road? I shall have Deb one week out of six."

"I shall come," answered Unity. "Where is Deb?"

"She is asleep. She cried herself to sleep."

"Chillern cry jes' fer nothin' at all," put in Mammy Chloe. "Don' you worry, honey! Miss Deb's
all right. I's gwine wake her now, an' wash her face, an' slip on her li'l white dress. She's
gwine be jes' ez peart an' ez happy! My Lawd! Miss Deb jes' gainin' a brother!"

"Jacqueline," came Cousin Jane Selden's voice at the door. "It is almost time."

The coach of the day was an ark in capacity, and woman's dress as sheathlike as a candle flame.
Jacqueline, Unity, Deb, Cousin Jane Selden, and a burly genial gentleman of wide family connections
and Republican tenets travelled to church in the same vehicle and were not crowded. The coach
was Cousin Jane Selden's; the gentleman was of some remote kinship, and had been Henry Churchill's
schoolmate, and he was going to give Jacqueline away. He talked to Cousin Jane Selden about
the possibilities of olive culture, and he showed Deb a golden turnip of a watch with jingling
seals. Jacqueline and Unity sat in silence, Jacqueline's arm around Deb. Behind their coach
came the small party gathered at Mrs. Selden's. The church was three miles down the road. It
was now afternoon, and the heat lay like a veil upon wood and field and the foot-hills of the
Blue Ridge. The dust rose behind the carriage, then sank upon and further whitened the milkweed
and the love vine and the papaw bushes. The blaze of light, the incessant shrilling of the
locusts, the shadeless pines, the drouth, the long, dusty road--all made, thought Unity, a
dry and fierce monotony that seared the eyes and weighed upon the soul. She wondered of what
Jacqueline was thinking.

The Church of Saint Margaret looked forth with a small, white-pillared face, from a grove of
oaks. It had a flowery churchyard, and around it a white paling, keeping in the dead, and keeping
out all roaming cattle. There was a small cracked bell, and the swallows forever circled above
the eaves and in and out of the belfry. Without the yard, beneath the oaks, were a horserack
and a shed for carriages. To-day there were horses at the rack and tied beneath the trees;
coaches, chaises, and curricles, not a few, beneath the shed and scattered through the oak
grove. The church within was all rustle and colour. Saint Margaret's had rarely seen such a
gathering, or such a wholly amicable one, for to-day all the pews were of one party. The wedding
was one to draw the curious, the resolutely Republican, the kindred and friends of Jefferson,--who,
it was known, had sent the bride a valuable present and a long letter,--the interested in Rand,
the inimical, for party and other reasons, to the Churchills and the Carys. The county knew
that Miss Churchill might have had Greenwood. The knowledge added piquancy to the already piquant
fact that she had chosen the house on the Three-Notched Road. Colonel Churchill and Major Edward,
the county knew, would not come to the wedding; neither, of course, would the two Carys; neither,
it appeared, would any other Federalist. The rustling pews looked to all four corners and saw
only folk of one watchword. True, under the gallery was to be seen Mr. Pincornet, fadedly gorgeous
in an old green velvet, but to this English stock Mr. Pincornet might give what word he chose;
he remained a French dancing master. The rustling pews nodded and smiled to each other, waiting
to see Jacqueline Churchill come up the aisle in bridal lace. Under the gallery, not far from
Mr. Pincornet, sat Adam Gaudylock, easy and tawny, dressed as usual in his fringed hunting-frock,
with his coonskin cap in his hand, and his gun at his feet. Beside him sat Vinie Mocket, dressed
in her best. Vinie's eyes were downcast, and her hands clasped in her lap. She wondered--poor
little partridge!--why she was there, why she had been so foolish as to let Mr Adam persuade
her into coming Vinie was afraid she was going to cry. Yet not for worlds would she have left
Saint Margaret's; she wanted, with painful curiosity, to see the figure in bridal lace She
wondered where Tom was Tom was to have joined Mr. Adam and herself an hour ago The bell began
to ring, and all the gathering rustled loudly. "She's coming--she's coming?" whispered Vinie,
and Adam, "Why, of course, of course, little partridge. Now don't you cry--you'll be walking
up Saint Margaret's aisle yourself some day!"

The bell ceased to ring. Lewis Rand came from the vestry and stood beside the chancel rail.
A sound at the door, a universal turning as though the wind bent every flower in a garden--and
Jacqueline Churchill came up the aisle between the coloured lines. Her hand was upon the arm
of her father's schoolmate; Unity and Deb followed her. Rand met her at the altar, and the
old clergyman who had baptized her married them. It was over, from the "Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here together," to the "Until Death shall them part!" Lewis and Jacqueline Rand
wrote their names in the register, then turned to receive the congratulations of those who
crowded around them, to smile, and say the expected thing. Rand stooped and kissed Deb, wrung
Mrs. Selden's hand, then held out his own to Unity with something of appeal in his gesture
and his eyes. Miss Dandridge promptly laid her hand in his, and looked at him with her frank
and brilliant gaze. "Now that we are cousins," she said, "I do not find you a monster at all.
Make her happy, and one day we'll all be friends." "I will--I will!" answered Rand, with emotion,
pressed her hand warmly, and was claimed by others of his wedding guests. Jacqueline, too,
had clung at first to Unity and Deb and Cousin Jane Selden, but now she also turned from the
old life to the new, and greeted with a smiling face the people of her husband's party. Many,
of course, she knew; only a difference of opinion stood between them and the Churchills; but
others were strangers to her--strangers and curious. She felt it in the touch of their hands,
in the stare of their eyes, and her heart was vaguely troubled. She saw her old dancing master,
tiptoeing on the edge of the throng, and her smile brought Mr. Pincornet, his green velvet
and powdered wig, to her side. He put his hand to his heart and bowed as to a princess.

"Ha! Mr. Pincornet," exclaimed Rand, "I remember our night at Monticello. Now I have a teacher
who will be with me always!--Jacqueline, I want you to speak to my old friend, Adam Gaudylock."

"Ah, I know Mr. Gaudylock," answered Jacqueline, and gave the hunter both her hands. "We all
know and admire and want to be friends with Adam Gaudylock!"

The picture that she made in her youth and beauty and bridal raiment was a dazzling one. Adam
looked at her so fully and so long that she blushed a little. She could not read the thought
behind his blue eyes. "You shall be my Queen if you like," he said at last, and Jacqueline
laughed, thinking his speech the woodsman's attempt to say a pretty thing.

Rand drew forward with determination a small brown figure. "Jacqueline, this is another good
friend of mine--Miss Lavinia Mocket, the sister of my law partner.--Vinie, Vinie, you are shyer
than a partridge! You shan't scuttle away until you have spoken to my wife!"

"Yeth, thir," said Vinie, her hand in Jacqueline's. "I wish you well, ma'am."

Rand and Adam laughed. Jacqueline, with a sudden soft kindliness for the small flushed face
and startled eyes, bent her flower-crowned head and kissed Vinie. "Oh!" breathed Vinie. "Yeth,
yeth, Mith Jacqueline, I thertainly wish you well!"

"Where's Tom?" asked Rand. "Tom should be here--" but Vinie had slipped from the ring about
the bride. Adam followed; Mr. Pincornet had already faded away. More important folk claimed
the attention of the newly wedded pair, and Mr. Mocket had not yet appeared when at last the
gathering, bound for the wedding feast at Mrs. Selden's, deserted the interior of the church
and flowed out under the portico and down the steps to the churchyard and the coaches waiting
in the road. Lewis and Jacqueline Rand came down the path between the midsummer flowers. They
were at the gate when the sight and sound of a horse coming at a gallop along the road drew
from Rand an exclamation. "Tom Mocket--and his horse in a lather! There's news of some kind--"

It was so evident, when the horse and rider came to a stop before the church gate, that there
was news of some kind, that the wedding guests, gentle and simple, left all talk and all employment
to crowd the grassy space between the gate and the road and to demand enlightenment. Mocket's
horse was spent, and Mocket's face was fiery red and eager. He gasped, and wiped his face with
a great flowered handkerchief. "What is it, man?" cried a dozen voices.

Mocket rose in his stirrups and looked the assemblage over. "We're all Republicans--hip, hip,
hurrah! Eh, Lewis Rand, I've brought you a wedding gift! The stage had just come in--I got
the news at the Eagle! Hip, hip--"

"Tom," said Rand at his bridle rein, "you've been drinking. Steady, man. Now, what's the matter?"

"A wedding gift! a wedding gift!" repeated Tom, taken with his own conceit. "And I never was
soberer, gentlemen, never 'pon honour! Hip, hip, hurrah! we're all good Republicans--but you'll
never guess the news!--The Creole's dead!"

"No!" cried Rand.

There arose an uproar of excited voices. "Yes, yes, it's true!" shouted Mocket. "The stage
brought it. He was challenged by Aaron Burr. They met at a place named Weehawken. Burr's first
shot ended it.--Sandy'll trouble us no more!"

"It's rumour--"

"No, no, it's gospel truth! There's a messenger from the President, and letters from all quarters.
He's dead, and Burr's in hiding! Gad! We'll have a rouse at the Eagle to-night! Blue lights
for Assumption and Funding and the Sedition Bill and Taxes and Standing Armies and the British
Alliance--

     "Oh, Alexander, King of Macedon,
     Where is your namesake, Andy Hamilton?

"In a hotter place, I hope, than Saint Kitts!"

"Hush!" said Rand. "Don't be ranting like a Mohawk! When a man's dead, it's time to let him rest."

He turned to the excited throng, and as he did so, he was aware that Jacqueline was standing
white and frozen, and that Unity was trying to take her hand. He felt for her an infinite tenderness,
and he promised himself to give Tom Mocket an old-time rating for at least one ill-advised
expression. Such wedding gifts were not for Jacqueline. But as for the news--Rand felt his
cheek grow hot and his eyes glow. In all the history of the country this was the decade in
which political animosity, pure and simple, went its greatest length. Each party thought of
the struggle as a battlefield; the Federalist strength was already broken, and now if the leader
was down, it was not in fighting and Republican nature to restrain the wild cheer for the rout
that must follow. Rand was a fighter too, and a captain of fighters, and the hundred whirling
thoughts, the hundred chances, the sense of victory, and the savage joy in a foe's defeat--all
the feeling that swelled his heart left him unabashed. But he thought of Jacqueline, and he
tried to choose his words. There would be now, he knew, no wedding feast at Mrs. Selden's.
Randolphs, Carrs, Coles, Carters, Dabneys, Gordons, Meriwethers, and Minors--all would wish
to hurry away. Plantation, office, or tavern, there would be letters waiting, journals to read,
men to meet, committees, clamour, and debate. Of the ruder sort who had crowded to the church,
many were already on the point of departure, mounting their horses, preparing for a race to
the nearest tavern and newspaper. "Gentlemen," exclaimed Rand, "if it's true news--if we have
indeed to deplore General Hamilton's death--"

"'Deplore!'" cried Mocket.

"'Deplore!'" echoed bluntly a Republican of prominence. "Don't let's be hypocrites, Mr. Rand.
We'll leave the Federalists to 'deplore'--"

"Oh, I'll deplore him with pleasure!" cried a third. "It won't hurt to drop a tear--but for
all that it's the greatest news since 1800!"

"Hip, hip, hurrah!"

"Weehawken! where's Weehawken? What's Burr in hiding for? Can't a gentleman fight a duel? Let
him come down here, and we'll give him a triumph!"

"'Deplore!'"--

"I chose my word badly," said Rand, with the good-nature that always disarmed; "I shall not
weep over my enemy, I only mean that I would not ignobly exult. Of course, sir, it is great
news--the very greatest! And all here will now want the leisure of the day."

"Tell them, Lewis, that I'll excuse them," said Cousin Jane Selden. "We won't have a feast
on the day of a funeral."

       *       *       *       *       *

A little later, deep in the embrace of the old Selden coach, husband and wife began their journey
to the house on the Three-Notched Road. In the minutes that followed the disposal of their
wedding guests it had been settled that they would not return to Mrs. Selden's--it was best
to go home instead. Cousin Jane would take Deb; Unity must return at once to Fontenoy. Hamilton
and Edward Churchill had served together on Washington's staff; of late years they had seldom
met, but the friendship remained. Unity knew, but would not speak of it, that Uncle Edward
had finished, only the night before, a long letter to his old comrade-at-arms. With the exception
of Deb, all the little party were aware that Jacqueline Rand's chances for forgiveness from
her uncles were measurably slighter for this day's tidings. She seemed dazed, pale as her gown,
but very quiet. She held Deb in her arms, and kissed Unity and Cousin Jane Selden. Her husband
lifted her into the coach, wrung the others' hands, and followed her. "Good-bye, Lewis," said
Mrs. Selden at the door. "I'll send a bowl of arrack to your men, and I'll ride over to-morrow
to see Jacqueline. Good-bye, children, and God bless you both!"

The coach and four took the dusty road. A turn, and Saint Margaret's was hidden, another, and
they were in a wood of beech and maple. The heat of the day was broken, and a wind was blowing.
Rand took Jacqueline's hands, unclasped and chafed them. "So cold!" he said. "Why could we
not have heard this news to-morrow!"

She shuddered strongly. "The noble--the great--" her voice broke.

"Is it so you think of him?" he asked. "Well--I, too, will call him noble and great--to-day.

     "No more for him the warmth of the bright sun;
     Nor blows upon his brow the wind of night!

"He's gone--and we all shall go. But this is our wedding day. Let us forget--let us forget
all else but that!"

"I grieve for the country," she said.

He kissed her hand. "Poor country! But her Sons die every day. She is like Nature--she takes
no heed. Let us, too, forget!"

"Oh, his poor wife--"

Rand drew her to him. "Will you mourn for me when I am dead?"

"No," she answered. "We will die together.--Oh, Lewis, Lewis, Lewis!"

"You promised that you would be happy," he said, and kissed her. "You promised you would not
let Fontenoy and the things of Fontenoy stand like a spectre between us. Forget this, too.
Everywhere there is dying. But it is our wedding day--and I love you madly--and life and the
kingdoms of life lie before us! If you are not happy, how can I be so?"

"But I am!" she cried, and showed him a glowing face. "I am happier than the happiest!"

The wood thinned into glades where the shadows of beech and maple were beginning to be long
upon the grass; then, in the afternoon light, the coach entered open country, fields of ox-eyed
daisies, and tall pine trees standing singly.

"I never came this far," said Jacqueline. "I never saw the house."

"It is there where the smoke rises beyond that tobacco-field," answered Rand. "All the tobacco
shall be changed into wheat."

They came in sight of the house,--a long storey-and-a-half structure of logs, with two small
porches and a great earthen chimney. Pine trees gave a scanty shade. House and outbuildings
and fencing had all been freshly whitewashed; over the porches flourished morning-glory and
Madeira vines, and the little yard was bright with hollyhock and larkspur. Jacqueline put her
hand in her husband's. Rand bent and kissed it with something in touch and manner formal and
chivalrous. "It is a poor house for you. Very soon I shall build you a better."

"I want no better," she answered. "Have you not lived here all these years?"

"Adam called you Queen. You should have a palace--"

"If I am Queen, then you must be a King. I think it is a lovely palace. What is that tree by
the gate--all feathery pink?"

"A mimosa. Mr. Jefferson gave it to me. It is like you--it does not belong on the Three-Notched
Road. It should stand in a palace garden with dim alleys, fountains, and orange groves." He
ended in a deeper tone, "Why not? One day we may plant a mimosa in such a garden, and smile
and say, 'Do you remember the tree--do you remember our wedding day?' Who knows--who knows?"

"You shall stay in that palace all alone," said Jacqueline. "I like this one best."

The house stood back from the road in its clump of pines. The coach stopped, and Rand and Jacqueline,
descending, crossed a strip of short grass tufted with fennel and velvet mullein to the gate
beneath the mimosa, entered the gay little yard, and moved up the path to the larger of the
two porches. They were at home. On the porch to welcome them they found the white man who worked
on shares and oversaw the farm, Joab and three other slaves of Rand's, Mammy Chloe, Hannah,
and the negro men who belonged to Jacqueline. These gave a noisy greeting. Rand put money into
the hands of the slaves and sent them away happy to the tumble-down quarter behind the house.
The white man took his leave, and Mammy Chloe and Hannah retired to the kitchen, where supper
was in preparation. Rand and Jacqueline entered together the clean, bare rooms.

Later, when Hannah's supper had been praised and barely touched, the two came again to the
porch, and presently, hand in hand, moved down the steps, and over the dry summer grass to
the mimosa at the gate. Here they turned, and in the gathering dusk looked back at the house,
the sleeping pines, and all the shadowy surrounding landscape.

"Hear the frogs in the marsh!" said Rand. "They are excited to-night. They know I have brought
a princess home."

"Listen to the cow-bells," she said. "I love to hear them, faint and far like that. I love
to think of you, a little barefoot boy, bringing home the cows--and never, never dreaming once
of me!"

"When could that have been?" he asked. "I have always dreamed of you--even when 'twas pain
to dream!--There is the first whip-poor-will. Whip-poor-will! Once it had the loneliest sound!
The moon is growing brighter. The dark has come."

"I love you, Lewis."

"Darling, darling! Listen! that is the night horn. The lights are out in the quarter. Do you
hear the stream--our stream--hurrying past the apple tree? It is hurrying to the sea--the great
sea. We've put out to sea together--you and I, just you and I!"

"Just you and I!" she echoed. "Oh, bliss to be together!"

"Let us go," he whispered. "Let us go back to the house," and with his arm around her, they
moved up the path between the flowers that had closed with the night.

CHAPTER XIII

THE THREE-NOTCHED ROAD

Lewis Rand and his wife dwelt that summer and autumn in the house on the Three-Notched Road,
and were happy there. If the ghost of Gideon Rand walked, the place, renovated, clean, bright,
and homely sweet, showed no consciousness of any influence of the dark. Passers-by on the dusty
road looked curiously at the gay little yard and the feathery mimosa and the house behind the
pines. "Lewis Rand lives there," they said, and made their horses go more slowly.

The pines hid the porch where Jacqueline sat with her work, or, hands about her knees, dreamed
the hours away. She was much alone, for after the first week Rand rode daily to his office
in Charlottesville. There was no reconciliation with her people. All her things had been sent
from Fontenoy. Linen that had been her mother's lay with bags of lavender in an old carved
chest from Santo Domingo, and pieces of slender, inlaid furniture stood here and there in the
room they called the parlour. Her candlesticks were upon the mantel, and her harp made the
room's chief ornament. Her fortune, which was fair, had been formally made over to her and
to Rand. She was glad it was no less; had it been vastly greater, she would only have thought,
"This will aid him the more." The little place was very clean, very sweet, ordered, quiet,
and lovable. She was a trained housewife as well as the princess of his story, and she made
the man she loved believe in Paradise. Each afternoon when he left the jargon and wrangling
of the courtroom his mind turned at once to his home and its genius. All the way through the
town, beckoning him past the Eagle and past every other house or office which had for him an
open door, he saw Jacqueline waiting beneath the mimosa at the gate, clad in white, her dark
hair piled high, about her throat a string of coral or of amber. Out on the road, beneath the
forest trees, in the radiance of the evening, he rode with his head high and a smile within
his eyes. All the scheming, all the labour and strife of the day, fell from him like rusty
armour, and his spirit bathed itself in the thought of that meeting. She did not always await
him at the gate; sometimes he found her half a mile from home, sitting in the sunset light
upon a stone beside the road. Then he dismounted, kissed her, and they walked together back
to their nest in the tree of life. Supper-time would follow, with the lighted candles and the
fragrance from Hannah's kitchen, and the little humorous talk with the old, fond, familiar
servants, and the deeper words between husband and wife of things done or to be done; then
quiet upon the porch, long silences, broken sentences of deep content, while the glow faded
and the stars came out; then the candles again and his books and papers, while she read or
sewed beside him. When his task was done she sang to him, and so drew on the hour when they
put out the lights and entered the quiet, spotless chamber where the windows opened to the east.

Rand worked as he had not worked before. All the springs were running, all the bitter wells
were sweet; to breathe was to draw in fulness of life, and all things were plastic to his touch.
Love became genius, and dreaming accomplishment. In Albemarle, in Virginia, in the country
at large, the time was one of excitement, fevered labour, and no mean reward. The election
for President was drawing on. Undoubtedly the Republicans and Jefferson would sweep the country,
but it behooved them to sweep it clean. The Federalist point of view was as simple. "Win! but
we'll not make broad the paths before you! Winning shall be difficult." The parties worked
like Trojans, and he who could speak spoke as often as any leader of heroic times.

At court house and at tavern banquets, at meetings here and meetings there, barbecues, dinners,
races, militia musters, gatherings at crossroads and in the open fields, by daylight and by
candlelight and by torchlight, Republican doctrine was expounded, and Federalist doctrine made
answer. The clash of the brazen shields was loud. It was a forensic people and a plastic time.
He who could best express his thought might well, if there were power in the thought, impress
it so deeply that it would become the hall-mark of his age. His chance was good. Something
more than fame of a day shone and beckoned before every more than able man. To stamp a movement
of the human mind, to stamp an age, to give the design to one gold coin from the mint of Time,--what
other prize worth striving for? The design?--one thought of moderate Liberty and the head of
Washington, another thought of Liberty and the head of Jefferson, another of License and a
head like Danton's, another of Empire and a conqueror's head.

In Albemarle, at all Republican gatherings the man most in demand was Lewis Rand; and the surrounding
counties of Fluvanna, Amherst, Augusta, and Orange considered themselves happy if he could
be drawn to this or that mass meeting. It was not easy to attract him. He never consciously
said to himself, "Be chary of favours; they will be the more prized"; he said instead, "I'll
not waste an arrow where there's no gold to hit." When he saw that it was worth his while to
go, he went, and sent an arrow full into the gold. Amherst and Augusta, Fluvanna and Orange,
broke into applause and prophecy, while upon each return home Republican Albemarle welcomed
him with added rapture, and Federalist Albemarle hurled another phrase into its already comprehensive
anathema. His reputation grew amain, both in his native section and in the state at large.
Before the autumn his election to the House of Delegates, which in April seemed so great a
thing, began to assume the appearance of a trifle in his fortunes. He would overtop that, and
how highly no man was prepared to say. The centre of the second line was occupied by a body of phalangite
infantry, formed of companies, which were drafted for this purpose from each of the brigades
of their phalanx. The officers in command of this corps were ordered to be ready to face about,
if the enemy should succeed in gaining the rear of the army. On the right of this reserve of infantry, in the
second line, and behind the royal horse-guards, Alexander placed half the Agrian light-armed
infantry under Attalus, and with them Brison's body of Macedonian archers, and Cleander's regiment
of foot. He also placed in this part of his army Menidas's squadron of cavalry, and Aretes's
and Ariston's light horse. Menidas was ordered to watch if the enemy's cavalry tried to turn
the flank, and if they did so, to charge them before they wheeled completely round, and so take them
in flank themselves. A similar force was arranged on the left of the second line for the same
purpose, The Thracian infantry of Sitalces was placed there, and
Coeranus's regiment of the cavalry of the Greek allies, and Agathon's
troops of the Odrysian irregular horse.

The extreme left of the second line in this quarter was held by Andromachus's cavalry. A division
of Thracian infantry was left in guard of the camp. In advance of the right wing and centre
was scattered a number of light-armed troops, of javelin-men and bowmen, with the intention
of warding off the charge of the armed chariots. [Kleber's arrangement of his troops at the battle
of Heliopolis, where, with ten thousand Europeans, he had to encounter eighty thousand Asiatics in
an open plain, is worth comparing with Alexander's tactics at Arbela. See Thiers's "Histoire du
Consulat," &c. vol. ii. livre v.]

Conspicuous by the brilliancy of his armour, and by the chosen band of officers who were round
his person, Alexander took his own station, as his custom was, in the right wing, at the head
of his cavalry: and when all the arrangements for the battle were complete, and his generals
were fully instructed how to act in each probable emergency, he began to lead his men towards the
enemy.

It was ever his custom to expose his life freely in battle, and to emulate the personal prowess
of his great ancestor, Achilles. Perhaps in the bold enterprise of conquering Persia, it was politic
for Alexander to raise his army's daring to the utmost by the example of his own heroic valour:
and, in his subsequent campaigns, the love of the excitement, of "the rapture of the strife," may have
made him, like Murat, continue from choice a custom which he commenced
from duty.

But he never suffered the ardour of the soldier to make him lose the coolness of the general; and
at Arbela, in particular, he showed that he could act up to his favourite Homeric maxim.

Great reliance had been placed by the Persian king on the effects of the scythe-bearing chariots.
It was designed to launch these against the Macedonian phalanx, and to follow them up by a
heavy charge of cavalry, which it was hoped would find the ranks of the spearmen disordered
by the rush of the chariots, and easily destroy this most formidable part of Alexander's force.
In front, therefore, of the Persian centre, where Darius took his station, and which it was
supposed the phalanx would attack, the ground had been carefully
levelled and smoothed, so as to allow the chariots to charge over
it with their full sweep and speed.

As the Macedonian army approached the Persian, Alexander found that the front of his whole
line barely equalled the front of the Persian centre, so that he was outflanked on his right by
the entire left; wing of the enemy, and by their entire right wing on his left. His tactics were
to assail some one point of the hostile army, and gain a decisive
advantage; while he refused, as far as possible, the encounter along
the rest of the line.

He therefore inclined his order of march to the right so as to enable
his right wing and centre to come into collision with the enemy on
as favourable terms as possible though the manoeuvre might in some
respects compromise his left.

The effect of this oblique movement was to bring the phalanx and his own wing nearly beyond the
limits of the ground which the Persians had prepared for the operations
of the chariots; and Darius, fearing to lose the benefit of this arm
against the most important parts of the Macedonian force, ordered
the Scythian and Bactrian cavalry, who were drawn up on his extreme
left, to charge round upon Alexander's right wing, and check its further
lateral progress.

Against these assailants Alexander sent from his second line Menidas's cavalry. As these proved
too few to make head against the enemy, he ordered Ariston also from the second line with
his light horse, and Cleander with his foot, in support of Menidas.

The Bactrians and Scythians now began to give way, but Darius reinforced
them by the mass of Bactrian cavalry from his main line, and an obstinate
cavalry fight now took place.

The Bactrians and Scythians were numerous, and were better armed
than the horseman under Menidas and Ariston; and the loss at first
was heaviest on the Macedonian side.

But still the European cavalry stood the charge of the Asiatics,
and at last, by their superior discipline, and by acting in squadrons
that supported each other, instead of fighting in a confused mass
like the barbarians, the Macedonians broke their adversaries, and
drove them off the field.

[The best explanation of this may be found in Napoleon's account
of the cavalry fights between the French and the Mamelukes:--"Two
Mamelukes were able to make head against three Frenchmen, because
they were better armed, better mounted, and better trained; they had
two pair of pistols, a blunderbuss, a carbine, a helmet with a vizor,
and a coat of mail; they had several horses, and several attendants
on foot.

One hundred cuirassiers, however were not afraid of one hundred Mamelukes; three hundred could
beat; an equal number, and one thousand could easily put to the rout
fifteen hundred, so great is the influence of tactics, order, and
evolutions!

Leclerc and Lasalle presented their men to the Mamelukes in several
lines.

When the Arabs were on the point of overwhelming the first, the second
came to its assistance on the right and left; the Mamelukes then halted
and wheeled, in order to turn the wings of this new line; this moment
was always seized upon to charge them, and they were uniformly broken."--MONTHOLON'S
HISTORY OF THE CAPTIVITY OF NAPOLEON, iv.

70.]

Darius, now directed the scythe-armed chariots to be driven against
Alexander's horse-guards and the phalanx; and these formidable vehicles
were accordingly sent rattling across the plain, against the Macedonian
line.

When we remember the alarm which the war-chariots of the Britons created among Caesar's legions, we
shall not be prone to deride this arm of ancient warfare as always
useless.

The object of the chariots was to create unsteadiness in the ranks against which they were driven,
and squadrons of cavalry followed close upon them, to profit by such
disorder.

But the Asiatic chariots were rendered ineffective at Arbela by the
light-armed troops whom Alexander had specially appointed for the
service, and who, wounding the horses and drivers with their missile
weapons, and running alongside so as to cut the traces or seize the
reins, marred the intended charge; and the few chariots that reached
the phalanx passed harmlessly through the intervals which the spearmen
opened for them, and were easily captured in the rear.

A mass of the Asiatic cavalry was now, for the second time, collected
against Alexander's extreme right, and moved round it, with the view
of gaining the flank of his army.

At the critical moment, Aretes, with his horsemen from Alexander's
second line, dashed on the Persian squadrons when their own flanks
were exposed by this evolution.

While Alexander thus met and baffled all the flanking attacks of the enemy with troops brought
up from his second line, he kept his own horse-guards and the rest
of the front line of his wing fresh, and ready to take advantage of
the first opportunity for striking a decisive blow.

This soon came. A large body of horse, who were posted on the Persian left wing nearest to the
centre, quitted their station, and rode off to help their comrades in the cavalry fight that
still was going on at the extreme right of Alexander's wing against the detachments from his
second line.

This made a huge gap in the Persian array, and into this space Alexander instantly dashed with
his guard; and then pressing towards his left, he soon began to make havoc in the left flank of the
Persian centre. The shield-bearing infantry now charged also among the reeling masses of the
Asiatics; and five of the brigades of the phalanx, with the irresistible
might of their sarissas, bore down the Greek mercenaries of Darius,
and dug their way through the Persian centre.

In the early part of the battle, Darius had showed skill and energy;
and he now for some time encouraged his men, by voice and example,
to keep firm.

But the lances of Alexander's cavalry, and the pikes of the phalanx
now gleamed nearer and nearer to him.

His charioteer was struck down by a javelin at his side; and at last Darius's nerve failed him;
and, descending from his chariot, he mounted on a fleet horse and
galloped from the plain, regardless of the state of the battle in
other parts of the field, where matters were going on much more favourably
for his cause, and where his presence might have done much towards
gaining a victory.

Alexander's operations with his right and centre had exposed his left
to an immensely preponderating force of the enemy.

Parmenio kept out of action as long as possible; but Mazaeus, who commanded the Persian right
wing, advanced against him, completely outflanked him, and pressed
him severely with reiterated charges by superior numbers.

Seeing the distress of Parmenio's wing, Simmias, who commanded the sixth brigade of the phalanx,
which was next to the left wing, did not advance with the other brigades in the great charge upon the Persian
centre, but kept back to cover Parmenio's troops on their right flank;
as otherwise they would have been completely surrounded and cut off
from the rest of the Macedonian army.

By so doing, Simmias had unavoidably opened a gap in the Macedonian
left centre; and a large column of Indian and Persian horse, from
the Persian right centre, had galloped forward through this interval,
and right through the troops of the Macedonian second line.

Instead of then wheeling round upon Sarmenio, or upon the rear of
Alexander's conquering wing, the Indian and Persian cavalry rode straight
on to the Macedonian camp, overpowered the Thracians who were left
in charge of it, and began to plunder.

This was stopped by the phalangite troops of the second line, who,
after the enemy's horsemen had rushed by them, faced about, countermarched
upon the camp, killed many of the Indians and Persians in the act
of plundering, and forced the rest to ride off again.

Just at this crisis, Alexander had been recalled from his pursuit of Darius, by tidings of
the distress of Parmenio, and of his inability to bear up any longer
against the hot attacks of Mazaeus.

Taking his horse-guards with him, Alexander rode towards the part
of the field where his left wing was fighting; but on his way thither
he encountered the Persian and Indian cavalry, on their return from
his camp.

These men now saw that their only chance of safety was to cut their way through; and in one
huge column they charged desperately upon the Macedonians.

There was here a close hand- to-hand fight, which lasted some time,
and sixty of the royal horse-guards fell, and three generals, who
fought close to Alexander's side, were wounded.

At length the Macedonian, discipline and valour again prevailed,
and a large number of the Persian and Indian horsemen were cut down;
some few only succeeded in breaking through and riding away.

Relieved of these obstinate enemies, Alexander again formed his horse-guards, and led them towards
Parmenio; but by this time that general also was victorious.

Probably the news of Darius's flight had reached Mazaeus, and had damped the ardour of the
Persian right wing; while the tidings of their comrades' success
must have proportionally encouraged the Macedonian forces under Parmenio.

His Thessalian cavalry particularly distinguished themselves by their
gallantry and persevering good conduct; and by the time that Alexander
had ridden up to Parmenio, the whole Persian army was in full flight
from the field.

It was of the deepest importance to Alexander to secure the person
of Darius, and he now urged on the pursuit.

The river Lycus was between the field of battle and the city of Arbela, whither the fugitives
directed their course, and the passage of this river was even more destructive to the Persians
than the swords and spears of the Macedonians had been in the engagement.

[I purposely omit any statement of the loss in the battle.

There is a palpable error of the transcribers in the numbers which we find in our present manuscripts
of Arrian; and Curtius is of no authority.] The narrow bridge was soon choked up by the flying
thousands who rushed towards it, and vast numbers of the Persians threw themselves, or were
hurried by others, into the rapid stream, and perished in its waters.

Darius had crossed it, and had ridden on through Arbela without halting. Alexander reached that
city on the next day, and made himself master of all Darius's treasure
and stores; but the Persian king unfortunately for himself, had fled
too fast for his conqueror: he had only escaped to perish by the treachery
of his Bactrian satrap, Bessus.

A few days after the battle Alexander entered Babylon, "the oldest
seat of earthly empire" then in existence, as its acknowledged lord
and master.

There were yet some campaigns of his brief and bright career to be accomplished. Central Asia
was yet to witness the march of his phalanx. He was yet to effect that conquest of Affghanistan
in which England since has failed.

His generalship, as well as his valour, were yet to be signalised
on the banks of the Hydaspes, and the field of Chillianwallah; and
he was yet to precede the Queen of England in annexing the Punjaub
to the dominions of an European sovereign.

But the crisis of his career was reached; the great object of his
mission was accomplished; and the ancient Persian empire, which once
menaced all the nations of the earth with subjection, was irreparably
crushed, when Alexander had won his crowning victory at Arbela.

SYNOPSIS OF EVENTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE OF ARBELA AND THE BATTLE OF THE METAURUS.

B.C. 330. The Lacedaemonians endeavour to create a rising in Greece against the Macedonian
power; they are defeated by Antipater, Alexander's viceroy; and their
king, Agis, falls in the battle.

330 to 327. Alexander's campaigns in Upper Asia. "Having conquered Darius, Alexander pursued his
way, encountering difficulties which would have appalled almost any other general, through Bactriana,
and taking Bactra, or Zariaspa, (now Balkh), the chief city of that province, where he spent the
winter. Crossing the Oxus, he advanced in the following spring to Marakanda (Samarcand) to replace
the loss of horses which he had sustained in crossing the Caucasus, to obtain supplies from
the rich valley of Sogd (the Mahometan Paradise of Mader-al-Nahr), and to enforce the submission
of Transoxiana. The northern limit of his march is probably represented by the modern Uskand,
or Aderkand, a village on the Iaxartes, near the end of the Ferganah district. In Margiana
he founded another Alexandria. Returning from the north, he led on his army in the hope of conquering
India, till at length, marching in a line apparently nearly parallel with the Kabul river,
he arrived at the celebrated rock Aornos, the position of which must have been on the right bank
of the Indus, at some distance from Attock; and it may perhaps be represented by the modern Akora"--(VAUX.)

327,
326. Alexander marches through, Affghanistan to the Punjaub. He defeats Porus. His troops refuse
to march towards the Ganges, and he commences the descent of the Indus. On his march he attacks
and subdues several Indian tribes, among others the Malli; in the storming of whose capital
(Mooltan), he is severely wounded. He directs his admiral, Nearchus, to sail round from the Indus to
the Persian Gulf; and leads the army back across Scinde and Beloochistan.

324. Alexander returns to Babylon. "In the tenth year after he had crossed the Hellespont,
Alexander, having won his vast dominion, entered Babylon; and resting
from his career in that oldest seat of earthly empire, he steadily
surveyed the mass of various nations which owned his sovereignty,
and revolved in his mind the great work of breathing into this huge
but inert body the living spirit of Greek civilization.

In the bloom of youthful manhood, at the age of thirty-two, he paused from the fiery speed
of his earlier course; and for the first time gave the nations an
opportunity of offering their homage before his throne.

They came from all the extremities of the earth to propitiate his anger, to celebrate his greatness,
or to solicit his protection. . . .

History may allow us to think that Alexander and a Roman ambassador did meet at Babylon; that the greatest
man of the ancient world saw and spoke with a citizen of that great
nation, which was destined to succeed him in his appointed work, and
to found a wider and still more enduring empire.

They met, too, in Babylon, almost beneath the shadow of the temple of Bel, perhaps the earliest
monument ever raised by human pride and power, in a city stricken, as it were, by the word
of God's heaviest judgment, as the symbol of greatness apart from and opposed to goodness."--(ARNOLD.)

323.
Alexander dies at Babylon. On his death being known at Greece, the Athenians, and others of
the southern states, take up arms to shake off the domination of Macedon. They are at first successful;
but the return of some of Alexander's veterans from Asia enables Antipater to prevail over
them.

317 to 289. Agathocles is tyrant of Syracuse; and carries on repeated wars with the Carthaginians;
in the course of which (311) he invades Africa, and reduces the Carthaginians to great distress.

306.
After a long series of wars with each other, and after all the heirs of Alexander had been murdered,
his principal surviving generals assume the title of king, each over
the provinces which he has occupied.



Rand, standing in the red torchlight above the attentive crowd, preached a high doctrine, preached
it austerely, boldly, and well. He did not speak to-night of the hundred party words, the flaunting
banners, systems, expedients, and policies fit for this turn of the spiral, born to be disavowed,
discarded, and thrown down by a higher, freer whorl; but he gave his voice for the larger Republicanism,
for the undying battle-cry, and the ever-streaming battle-flag. He had no less a text than
the Liberty and Happiness of the human race, and he made no straying from the subject.

Freedom! Happiness! What is freedom? What is happiness? Freedom is the maximum of self-government
finally becoming automatic, and the minimum of government from without finally reduced to the
vanishing-point. Happiness is the ultimate bourne, the Olympian goal, the intense and burning
star towards which we travel. Does not its light even now fall upon us? even now we are palely
happy. And how shall we know the road? and what if, in the night-time, we turn irremediably
aside? How are they to be attained, true Liberty and true Happiness? Learn! Light the lamp,
and the shadows will flee.--Self-government. Teach thyself temperance, foresight, and wise
memory of the past. Thou thyself, in thine own body, art a community. See, then, that thy communal
life is clean, that thy will is in right operation, and thy minds divide thee not to disaster.
Thy very ego, is it not but thy president, the voice of all thy members, representative of
all that thy race has made thee to be, effect of ten million causes, and cause of effects thou
canst not see? Let thy ego strengthen itself, deal justly, rule wisely, that thy state fall
not behind in this world-progress and be lost out of time and out of mind, in a night without
a dawn. There have been such things: over against immortal gain there lies immortal loss. Work,
then, while it is day, for if thou work not, the night will make no tarrying. Know thyself,
and, knowing, rule that strange world of thine. Were it not a doom, were it not a frightful
doom, that it should come to rule thee? ... Government from without! Government of to-day,
Government abroad as we see it in every journal, in every letter that we open--how heavy, how
heavy is the ball and chain the nations wear! If we alone in this land go free, if for four
golden years we have moved with lightness, look to it lest a gaoler come! Government! What
is the ideal government? It is a man of business, worthy and esteemed, administering his client's
affairs with thoroughness, economy, and honour. It is a wise judge, holding the balances with
a steadfast hand, sitting there clothed reverently, to judge uprightly and to do no more. It
is a skilled council, a picked band, an honourable Legion, chosen of the multitude, to determine
the line of march for an advancing civilization; to make such laws as are according to reason
and necessity and to make none that are not, and to provide for the keeping of the law that
is made. The careful man of affairs, the upright judge, the honest maker of honest laws must
needs present an account for maintenance and for that expenditure which shall give offence
neither to generosity nor to justice; and the account must be paid, yea, and ungrudgingly!
Let us pay, then, each man according to his ability, the tax that is right and fitting; and
let us, moreover, give due honour to the vanguard of the people. It is there that the great
flag waves with all the blazonry of the race. But we want no substituted banner, no private
ensign, no conqueror's flapping eagles! Government! Honour the instrument by which we rule
ourselves; but worship not a mechanical device, and call not a means an end! Admirable means,
but oh, the sorry end! Therefore we'll have no usurping Prætorian, no juggling sophist, no
bailiff extravagant and unjust, no spendthrift squandering on idleness that which would pay
just debts! A ruler! There's no halo about a ruler's head. The people--the people are the sacred
thing, for they are the seed whence the future is to spring. He who betrays his trust, which
is to guard the seed,--what is that man--Emperor or President, Louis or George, Pharaoh or
Cæsar--but a traitor and a breaker of the Law? He may die by the axe, or he may die in a purple
robe of a surfeit, but he dies! The people live on, and his memory pays. He has been a tyrant
and a pygmy, and the ages hold him in contempt.... War! There are righteous wars, and righteous
men die in them, but the righteous man does not love war. Conquest! Conquest of ignorance,
superstition, and indolence, conquest of the waste and void, of the forces of earth, air, and
water, and of the dying beast within us, but no other conquest! We attained Louisiana by fair
trade, for the benefit of unborn generations. Standing armies! We want them not. Navies! The
sea is the mother of life; why call her that of death? Her highways are for merchant ships,
for argosies carrying corn and oil, bearing travellers and the written thought of man; for
voyages of discovery and happy intercourse, and all rich exchange from strand to strand. Why
stain the ocean red? Is it not fairer when 'tis blue? Guard coast-line and commerce, but we
need no Armada for that. Make no quarrels and enter none; so we shall be the exemplar of the
nations.... Free Trade. We are citizens and merchants of the world. No man or woman but lives
by trade and barter. Long ago there was a marriage between the house of Give and the house
of Take, and their child is Civilization. Sultan or Czar may say, "Buy here, sell there, and
at this price. You are my slave. Obey!" But who, in this century and this land, shall say that
to me--or to you? Are we free men? Then let us walk as such through the marts of the earth.
"Trade where you will," saith Nature. "It was so I brought the tree to the barren isle, and
scattered the life of the seas." Authority of law! Respect the law, and to that end let us
have laws that are respectable. Laws are made to be kept, else we live in a house of chicane.
But there is a danger that decrees may thicken until they form a dungeon grate for Freedom,
until, like Gulliver, she is held down to earth by every several hair. Few laws and just, and
those not lightly broken. The Contract between the States--let it be kept. It was pledged in
good faith--the cup went around among equals. There is no more solemn covenant; we shall prosper
but as we maintain it. Is it not for the welfare and the grandeur of the whole that each part
should have its healthful life? The whole exists but by the glow within its parts. Shall we
become dead members of a sickly soul? God forbid! but sister planets revolving in their orbits
about one central Idea, which is Freedom by Coöperation. To each her own life, varied, rich,
complete, and her communal life, large with service rendered and received! Each bound to other
and to that central Thought by primal law, but each a sovereign orb, grave mistress of her
own affairs! Slavery! Ay, I will give you that though you want it not! Slavery is abominable.
There is a tree that grows in the tropics which they call the upas tree. All who lie in the
shadow of its branches fall asleep, and die sleeping. To-day we lie under the upas tree--would
that we were awake! I have heard that--in the tropics--the sons sometimes hew down that which
the fathers have planted. I would that it were so in Virginia! Freedom of thought, of speech,
and of pen. I will away with this cope of lead, this Ancient Authority, which is too often
an Ancient Iniquity. Did it not have once a minority? was it not once a New Thought? Is not
a man's thought to-day as potent, holy, and near the right as was his great-grandfather's thought
which was born in a like manner, of the brain of a man, in a modern time? I will think freely
and according to reason. When it seems wise to tell my mind I will speak; and with judgment
I will write down my thought; and fear no man's censure. Knowledge! I was a poor boy, and I
strove for learning, strove hard, and found it worth the striving. I know the hunger, and I
know the rage when one asks for knowledge and asks in vain. Is it not a shameful thing that
happy men, lodged warm and clear in the Interpreter's house, should hear the groping in the
dark without, know that their fellows are searching, in pain and with shortness of breath,
for the key which let the fortunate in, and make no stir to aid those luckless ones? Give of
your abundance, or your abundance will decay in your hands and turn to that which shall cause
you shuddering!

His words went on, magnetic as the man. He spoke for an hour, coming at the last to a consideration
of those particular questions which hung in Virginian air. He dealt with these ably, and he
subtly conciliated those of his audience who might differ with him. None could have called
him flatterer, but when he ceased to speak his hearers, feeling for themselves a higher esteem,
had for him a reflex glow. It was what he could always count upon, and it furthered his fortunes.
Now they crowded about him, and it was late before, pleading the fatigue of his journey, he
could escape from their friendly importunity. At last, it being towards midnight and the moon
riding high, the neighbouring planters and their guests got to saddle and, after many and pressing
offers of hospitality to Rand and his wife, galloped off to home and bed. The commonalty and
the hangers-on faded too into the darkness, and the folk who were sleeping at the inn took
their candles and said good-night. All was suddenly quiet,--a moonlit crossroads in Virginia,
tranquil as the shaven fields and the endless columns of the pine.

Upstairs, in the low "best room," Rand found his wife still seated by the open window, her
folded arms upon the sill, her eyes raised to the stars that shone despite the moon. He crossed
to her and closed the window. "The night is cold. Dearest, have you been sitting here all this
time?"

She rose, turning upon him a radiant face. "All this time. I was not cold. I was warm. I am
so happy that I'm frightened."

"Did you like it?" he asked. "I hoped that you would. I thought of you--my star, my happiness!"

"I used to wonder," she said; "when they would come home to Fontenoy and say, 'Lewis Rand spoke
to-day,' I used to wonder if I should ever hear you speak! And when they blamed you I said
to my aching heart, 'They need not tell me! He's not ambitious, self-seeking, a leveller, a
demagogue and Jacobin!-he is the man I met beneath the apple tree!' And I was right--I was right!"

"Am I that man?" he asked. "I will try to be, Jacqueline. Leveller, demagogue, and Jacobin
I am not; but for the rest, who knows--who knows? Men are cloudy worlds--and I dream sometimes
of a Pursuer."

The next morning the skies had changed, and Rand and Jacqueline fared forward through a sodden,
grey, and windy day. The rain had ceased to fall when at twilight they came into Richmond by
the Broad Street Road. Lights gleamed from the wet houses; high overhead grey clouds were parting,
and in the west was a line of red. The wind was high, and the sycamores with which the town
abounded rocked their speckled arms. The river was swollen and rolled hoarsely over the rocks
beneath the red west. Rand had taken a house on Shockoe Hill, not far from the Chief Justice's,
and to this he and Jacqueline came through the wet and windy freshness of the night. Smiling
in the doorway were the servants--Joab and Mammy Chloe and Hannah--who had set out from Albemarle
the day before their master and mistress. Rand and Jacqueline, leaving the mud-splashed chaise,
were welcomed with loquacity and ushered into a cheerful room where there was a crackling fire
and a loaded table.

"Mrs. Leigh's compliments, Miss Jacqueline, an' she done sont de rolls. Mrs. Fisher's best
wishes, an' she moughty glad to hab a neighbour, an' she done sont de broiled chicken. An'
Mr. Hay, he done sont de oysters wid he compliments--an' de two bottles Madeira Mr. Ritchie
sont--an' Mr. Randolph lef' de birds, an' he gwine come roun' fust thing in de mawnin'--"

"We shall have friends," said Rand. "I am glad for you, sweetheart. But I wish that one Federalist
had had the grace to remember that Jacqueline Churchill came to town to-day."

"Ah, once I would have cared," answered Jacqueline. "It does not matter now."

"There's a tear on your hand--"

Jacqueline laughed. "At least, it doesn't matter much.--Is that all, Joab?"

"An' Marse Ludwell Cary, he ride erroun in de rain an' leave he compliments for Marse Lewis,
an' he say will Miss Jacqueline 'cept dese yer flowers--"

"One remembered," said Rand, and watched his wife put the flowers in water.

CHAPTER XIV

THE LAW OFFICE

"If you were not so damned particular--" said the weasel disconsolately.

"I'm not damned particular," answered Rand. "I've wanted wealth and I've wanted power ever
since I went barefoot and suckered tobacco--as you know who know me better than almost any
one else! But this"--he tapped the papers on the table before him--"this is cheating."

"Oh, you!" complained the scamp. "You are of the elect. What you want you'll take by main force.
You are a strong man! You've taken a deal since that day we went into the bookshop by the bridge.
But I'm no Samson or David--I'm just Tom Mocket--and still, why shouldn't I have my pennyworth?"

Rand paused in his walking up and down the office in Main Street. It was the late winter, a
year and more from that evening when he and Jacqueline had first come to the house on Shockoe
Hill. Standing by the rough deal table, he laid an authoritative hand upon the documents with
which it was strewn. "You'll never get your pennyworth here. The scheme these gentry have afoot
is just a Yazoo business. If these lands exist, they're only a hunting-ground of swamp, Indians,
and buffalo. The survey is paper, the cleared fields a fable, the town Manoa, the scheme a
bubble, the purchasers fools, and the sellers knaves,--and there's your legal opinion in a
nutshell!"

"I didn't ask for a legal opinion," said Mocket. "I'm a lawyer myself. There's land there,
you'll not deny, and a river, and plenty of game If a Yankee doesn't find it Paradise, he had
no chance anyhow, and a Kentuck can care for himself! There's no sense in calling it a bubble,
or being so damned scrupulous!"

Rand made a gesture of contempt. "You let Yazoo companies and the Promised Land alone! People
are ceasing to be fools. To-day they demand a hair of the mammoth or a sample of the salt mountain."

Mocket ceased rustling the papers on the table, and turned to regard his chief more closely.
"Lewis, I've heard you say things like that more than once lately. A year ago you were mighty
respectful to Mr. Jefferson's salt mountain and strange bones and great elk and silk grass
and all the rest of it. That was a curious letter of yours in the Examiner. If't was meant
to defend his neutrality doings, 'twas a damned lukewarm defence! If I hadn't known 'twas yours,
sink me if I wouldn't have thought it a damned piece of Federal sarcasm!--Did you send that
paper to the President?"

"No, I did not send it."

"Lewis," said the scamp slowly, "are you breaking with Mr. Jefferson?"

Rand walked to the window and stood looking out upon the winter afternoon. It was snowing hard,
and through the drifting veil the trees across the way could hardly be discerned. "Yes," he
said deliberately. "Yes,--if you call it breaking with a man to have grown away from him. If
he served me once--yes, and greatly!--have I not worked for him since, hand and foot? We are
quits, I think. I shall not cease to esteem him."

Mocket breathed hard with excitement. "You haven't been natural for a long time--but I didn't
know 't was this--"

"I am being natural now," said Rand somewhat sternly. "I've told you, Tom, and now let it alone.
Least said is soonest mended."

"But--but--" stammered the scamp, "are you going over to the other camp?"

Rand did not at once answer. From a plate on the windowsill he took a crust of bread, and,
raising the sash, crumbled it upon the snow without. The sparrows came at once, alighting near
his hand with a tameness that spoke of pleasing association with the providence above them.
"No," said Rand at last, "I am not going over to the other camp--if by that you mean the Federalist
camp. Must one forever sign under a captain? It is not my instinct to serve.--Now let it alone."

He closed the window and, turning again to the table, bent over an unrolled map which covered
half its surface. The chart was a large one, showing the vast territory drained by the Ohio,
the Missouri, and the Mississippi, and the imagination of the cartographer had made good his
lack of information. Rivers and mountains appeared where nature had made no such provision,
while the names, quaint and uncouth, with which Jefferson proposed to burden states yet in
embryo sprawled in large letters across the yellow plain. "Assenispia--Polypotamia--Chersonesus--Michigania,"
read Rand. "Barbarous! I could name them better out of Ossian!" He traced with his finger the
lower Ohio. "This is where Blennerhasset's island should be." The finger went on down the Mississippi.
"What a river! When it is in flood, it is a sea. And the rich black fields on either side!
Cotton! Our Fortunatus purse shall be spun of that. They call the creeks bayous. All these
little towns--French and Spanish. To speak to them of Washington is to speak of the moon--so
distant and so cold. Here are Indians. Here are settlers from the East, and the burden of their
song is, 'We are so far from the Old Thirteen that we care not if we are farther yet!'"

"Hey!" exclaimed Mocket. "That's treason!"

"Here Adam Gaudylock met Wilkinson. The river narrows here, and runs deep and strong." Rand's
hand rested on the coast-line. "New Orleans," he said, "but capable of becoming a new Rome.
Here to the westward is the Perdido that they call the boundary,--then Mexico and the City
of Mexico. If not New Orleans, then Mexico!" He straightened himself with a laugh. "I am dreaming,
Tom--just as I used to dream in the fields! Ugh! I feel the hot sun, and the thick leaves draw
through my hands! Let's get back to every day. To-morrow in the House I am going to carry the
Albemarle Resolutions. The last debate is on. Wirt speaks first, and then I speak."

"Ludwell Cary is fighting you," said Mocket. "Fighting hard."

"Yes."

"Well, I'll be there to hear you speak. Lord! if I could speak like you, Lewis, and plan like
you, and if whiskey would let me alone, and if I wasn't afraid of the dark, I'd make a stir
in the country--I'd go higher than a Franklin kite!"

"You might manage the rest," said Rand, with good-natured scorn; "but it doesn't do to be afraid
of the dark."

From the pegs behind the door he took his greatcoat and beaver. "I am going home now," he said.
"I have company to supper."

"Who, then?" asked Mocket. "Adam Gaudylock? He's in town."

Rand laughed. "Who, then?' Tom, Tom, you've the manners of the West Indian skippers you consort
with! No, it's not Adam Gaudylock. It is--" He hesitated, then took up a pen and wrote two
words. "That's his name--but you are to keep it dark."

Mocket's tilted chair came noisily to the floor. "What! In Richmond!--he in Richmond! When
did he come? Where's he staying?"

"He came last night, and he's staying quietly at Bowler's Tavern. It isn't known that he's
here, and he is not anxious that it should be known. He's here on business, and he goes to-morrow.
That is all--and you're to say no word of what I tell you."

"All right," quoth Tom. "I won't blab. But I'd mightily like to see the man who shot Alexander
Hamilton."

"I've told you he's not anxious for company."

"Oh, I know!" said Tom, not without humility. "I'm small fry. Well, there are curious things
said about him, and you and he are strange bedfellows! How did it happen?"

"Tom, Tom," answered Rand, "you ask too many questions! It was an accident, or it was predestined
and foreordained when I was dust blown about by the wind. You may take your choice according
to your theology! I'm going now. Be at the House early to-morrow."

"Are you going to take that Mathews case? Young Mathews was here yesterday, swearing that if
he couldn't get you, he would hang himself."

"I've said that I would take it."

"Ludwell Cary's for the other side."

"Yes, I know. I'll win."

"Well, you're fairly pitted. Half the town backs one and half the other. That letter signed
'Aurelius' in the Gazette--did you know 'twas his?"

Rand dropped his hand from the latch. The colour rushed to his face, then ebbed as quickly.
"No, I did not know," he said, in a voice that was not quite steady. "I thought of quite another
man."

"It is Ludwell Cary's, and every Black Cockade in Richmond, and not a few Republicans, are
quoting it. My certie! it was a commentary in caustic--and so damned courteous all the time!"

"I don't care for such courtesy," answered Rand "Ludwell Cary had best look where he treads."

"Well, I thought I'd tell you," said his colleague "I don't like the Carys, either!--And so
I'm not to go into that land scheme?"

"No. It's a small thing, and not honest. Some day, Tom, I'll help you to a larger thing than that."

"And honest?" said Mocket shrewdly.

The other turned upon him with anger, black as it was sudden. "Honest! Yes, honest as this
storm, honest as any struggle for any piece of earth wider than a coffin space! Who are you
to question me? I give you warning--"

"Gently, gently!" exclaimed the scamp, and started back. "Lord, how Gideon peeps out of you
now and then!"

"You need not say that, either," retorted Rand grimly. He stood for a moment, a cloudy presence
in the darkening room, then with a short laugh recovered himself. "I thought the black dog
was dead," he said. "It's this gloomy day--and I did not sleep last night. Honest! We're all
indifferent honest!"

"Well, well," answered the pacific Tom, "I'll sink or swim with you. I've followed where you
have led this many a day."

Outside the red brick office the snow lay deep. It was still falling steadily, in large flakes,
grey in the upper air, feathery white and pure against the opposite houses and the boles of
leafless trees. The day was closing in. Up and down the street merchants were putting up their
shutters; customers had been few on such a snowy day. Here and there appeared a figure, booted
and greatcoated, emerging from a tavern or from a law office such as Rand's. A sledge passed,
laden with pine and hickory, drawn by mules with jangling bells; and a handful of boys loosed
from school threw down their bags of books and fell to snowballing. A negro shuffled by with
a spade on his shoulder, singing as he went,--

     "Didn't my Lawd deliber Daniel,
     Didn't my Lawd deliber Daniel,
         An' why not ebery man?
     He delibered Daniel from de lions' den,
     An' de Hebrew Chillern from de furnace,
     He delibered David from de han' of Saul,
         An' why not ebery man?"

Rand turned into Governor Street, climbed its white ascent, and struck across the Capitol Square.
Above him every bough had its weight of snow, and seen through the drifting veil the pillared
Capitol looked remote as that building of which it was a copy. He walked quickly, with a light
and determined step, a handsome figure in a many-caped coat of bottle green, striding through
the snow toward the cheer of home. In his outer man, at least, the eighteen months since his
marriage had wrought a change. What was striking then was more striking now,--his ease and
might of frame, the admirable poise of his head, and the force expressed in every feature,
the air of power that was about him like an emanation. The difference was that what had been
rude strength was now strength polished and restrained. The deeps might hide abrupt and violent
things, but the surface had assumed a fine amenity. Where he wished to learn he was the aptest
pupil, and from the days of the tobacco-field he had longed for this smooth lustre. Not Gideon,
but the mother, spoke in the appreciation and the facility. Manner counted for much in Lewis
Rand's day; the critical point was not what you did, but the way you did it. Rand set himself
to learn from his wife all the passwords of the region native to her, but into which he had
broken. She taught him that code with a courtesy and simplicity exquisitely high-minded and
sweet, and he learned with quickness, gratitude, and lack of any false shame. What else he
might have learned of her he dimly felt, but he had not covenanted with existence for qualities
that would war with a hundred purposes of his brain and will. He and Jacqueline were lovers
yet. At the sight of each other the delicate fire ran through their veins; in absence the mind
felt along the wall and dreamed of the gardens within. If the woman who had given all was the
more constant lover; if the man, while his passion sweetened all his life, yet bowed before
his great idol and fought and slaved for Power, it was according to the nature of the two,
and there was perhaps no help.

He left the Capitol Square and went on toward the house he had retaken for the second winter
in Richmond. Few were afoot, though now and then a sleigh went by. Rand's mind as he walked
was busy, not with the debate of to-morrow or the visitor of to-night, the Mathews trial or
Tom Mocket's puerile schemes, but with the letter in the Gazette signed "Aurelius." It had
been an attack, able beyond the common, certainly not upon Lewis Rand, but upon the party which,
in the eyes of the generality, he yet most markedly represented. In the inflamed condition
of public sentiment such attacks were of weekly occurrence; the wise man was he who put them
by unmoved. For the most part Rand was wise. Federal diatribes upon the Tripoli war, the Florida
purchase, the quarrel with Spain, Santo Domingo, Neutral Trade, and Jefferson's leanings toward
France left him cold. This letter in the Gazette had not done so. It had gone to the sources
of things, analyzing with a coolness and naming with a propriety the more remarkable that it
acknowledged, on certain sides, a community of thought with the party attacked. The result
was that, as in civil war, the quarrel, through understanding, was the more determined. The
man who signed "Aurelius" had not spared to point out, with a certain melancholy sternness,
the plague spots, the defenceless places. Moreover, throughout his exposition there ran a harsh
and sombre thread, now felt in denunciation and now in ironic praise. There was more than unveiling
of the weakness of any human policy or party; the letter was in part a commination of individual
conduct. No name was used, no direct reference given or example quoted; but one with acumen
might guess there was a man in mind when the writer sat in judgment. The writer himself was
perhaps not aware of the fulness of this betrayal, but Lewis Rand was aware. The paper had
angered him, and he had not lacked intention of discovering at whose door it was to be laid.
He had enemies enough--but this one was a close observer. The subtlety of the rebuke shook
him. How had the writer who signed "Aurelius" known or divined? He thought of Major Edward
Churchill, but certain reasons made him sure the letter was not his. And now it seemed that
it was Ludwell Cary's.

Rand's lips set closely. Ludwell Cary might not know where all his shafts were striking, but
Rand felt the sting. Fair fight in the courtroom,--that was one thing,--but this paper was
wrought of sterner stuff. There was in it even a solemnity of warning. Rand's soul, that was
in the grasp of Giant Two-Ways, writhed for a moment, then lay still again. With his characteristic
short laugh, he shook off the feeling that he mistook for weakness, dismissed the momentary
abashment, and pursued his way through the snowy streets. The question now in his mind was
whether or no he should make his resentment plain to Ludwell Cary. At long intervals, three
or four times in the winter, perhaps, it was the latter's custom to lift the knocker of Rand's
door, and to sit for an hour in Jacqueline's drawing-room. Sometimes Rand was there, sometimes
not; Cary's coming had grown to be a habit of the house, quiet, ordered, and urbane as all
its habits were. Its master now determined, after a moment's sharp debate, to say nothing that
he might not have said before he knew the identity of that writer to the Gazette. He was conscious
of no desire for immediate retaliation; these things settled themselves in the long run. He
did not intend speaking of the matter to Jacqueline. Pride forbade his giving Cary reason to
surmise that he had hit the truth. Rand was willing to believe that many of the shafts were
chance-sent. The reflection hardly lessened his anger, but it enabled him to thrust the matter
behind him to the limbo of old scores.

He was crossing Broad Street when the door of a house before him opened, and a young man, with
a gay word of farewell to some one in the doorway, ran down the steps and into the snowy street.
It was Fairfax Cary. Rand and he, passing, lifted their hats, but they did not speak. Had it
been the elder Cary, there would have been a moment's tarrying, an exchange of courteous speech.
But Fairfax Cary made no secret of his enmity. If he did not offensively publish it, if he
was, indeed, for so young a man, somewhat grimly silent upon those frequent occasions when
Rand was talked of, the hostility was defined, and at times frank. He went on now with his
handsome head held high. Rand looked after him with a curious, even a wistful smile upon his
lips. He was himself a man young in years and strength of passion, but older far in experience
and in thought. He did not dislike Fairfax Cary; he thought indeed that the young man's spirit,
bearing, and partisanship were admirable. His smile was for the thought that had lightened
through his mind: "If in after years I could have a son like that!" He wanted children; he
wanted a son. Rand sighed. The day had been vexatious, and there were heavy questions yet to
settle before the evening closed. After all, what was the use, since Jacqueline cared nothing
for baubles, and there was no child! Better live out his days at Roselands, a farmer and a
country lawyer! He shook off the weight, summoned all his household troop of thoughts, and
went on homewards through the falling snow.

CHAPTER XV

COMPANY TO SUPPER

Jacqueline arranged the flowers, cut from her window stand, in the porcelain vase, and set
the vase with care in the centre of the polished table. All was in order, from the heavy damask
napkins and the Chelsea plates to the silver candlesticks and the old cut-glass. She turned
her graceful head, and called to her husband, whose step she heard in the adjoining room. He
came, and, standing beside her, surveyed the mahogany field. "Is there anything lacking?" she
asked.

He turned and kissed her. "Only that you should be happy!" he said.

"If I am not," she answered, "he will never find it out! But when I see him, I shall hear that
fatal shot!"

"He will make you quite forget it. All women like him."

"Then I shall be the exception. General Hamilton was Uncle Edward's friend. At Fontenoy they'll
call it insult that I have talked with this man!"

"They will not know," Rand replied. "It was an honest duel fought nigh two years ago. Forget--forget!
There's so much one must forget. Besides, others are forgiving. There is not now the old enmity
between him and the Federalists." "No?" said Jacqueline. "Why is that?"

"I cannot tell you, but old differences are being smoothed over. It is rather the Republicans
who are out with him."

"I know that he is no friend to Mr. Jefferson."

"No, he is no friend to Mr. Jefferson. The room looks well, sweetheart. But some day you shall
have a much grander one, all light and splendour, and larger flowers than these--"

His wife rested her head against his shoulder. "I don't want it, Lewis. It is only you who
care for magnificence. Sometimes I wonder that you should so care."

"It is my mother in me," he answered. "She cared--poor soul. But I don't want magnificence
for myself. I want it for you--"

"You must not want it for me," cried Jacqueline, with wistful passion. "I am happy here, and
I am happy at Roselands--but I was happiest of all in the house on the Three-Notched Road!"

There was a moment's silence, then Rand spoke slowly. "I was not born for content. I am urged
on--and on--and I cannot always tell right from wrong. There is a darkness within me--I wish
it were light instead!" He laughed. "But if wishes were horses, beggars might ride!--And you've
cut all your pretty bright flowers! After supper, before we begin our talk, you must sing to
him. They say his daughter is an accomplished and beautiful woman. But you--you are Beauty,
Jacqueline!"

The knocker sounded. "That is he," exclaimed Rand, and went into the hail to welcome his guest.
Jacqueline returned to the drawing-room, and waited there before the fire. She was dressed
in white, with bare neck and arms and her mother's amethysts around her throat. In a moment
the two men entered. "This is my wife, Colonel Burr," said Rand.

Jacqueline curtsied. A small, slight, black-eyed, and smiling gentleman bowed low, and with
much grace of manner took and kissed her hand. "Mr. Rand, now I understand the pride in your
voice! Madam, I wish my daughter Theodosia were with me. She is my pride, and when I say that
you two would be friends, I pay you both a compliment!"

"I have heard much of her," answered Jacqueline, "and nothing but good. My husband tells me
that you have been in the South--and in Virginia we are welcoming you with a snowstorm!"

"The cold is all outside," said Colonel Burr. "Permit me--"

He handed his hostess to the green-striped sofa, and seated himself beside her with a sigh
of appreciation for the warmth and soft light of the pleasant room, and the presence of woman.
"Your harp!" he exclaimed. "I should have brought a sheaf of Spanish songs such as the ladies
sing to the guitar in New Orleans!--My dear sir, your fair wife and my Theodosia must one day
sing together, walk hand in hand together, in that richer, sweeter land! They shall use the
mantilla and wield the fan. Crowns are too heavy--they shall wear black lace!"

He spoke with not unpleasant brusqueness, a military manner tempered with gallantry, and he
looked at Rand with quick black eyes. "Yes, they must meet," said Rand simply. He spoke composedly,
but he had nevertheless a moment's vision of Jacqueline, away from the snow and the storm,
walking in beauty through the gardens of a far country. He saw her with a circlet of gold upon
her head, a circlet of Mexican gold. Crowns were heavy, but men--ay, and women, too!--fought
for them. Hers should be light and fanciful upon her head. She should wear black lace if she
chose,--though always he liked her best in white, in her kingdom, in the kingdom he was going
to help Aaron Burr establish.--No! in the kingdom Aaron Burr should help Lewis Rand establish!
His dream broke. He was not sure that he meant to come to an understanding with Burr. It depended--it
depended. But still he saw Jacqueline in trailing robes, with the gold circlet on her head.

Joab at the door announced supper, and the three went into the dining-room, where the red geraniums
glowed between the candles. Jacqueline took her place behind the coffee-urn, and Joab waited.

The meal went pleasantly on. Colonel Burr was accomplished in conversation, now supple and
insinuating as a courtier, now direct, forceful, even plain, as became an old soldier of the
Revolution, always agreeable, and always with a fine air of sincerity. The daughter of Henry
Churchill did not lack wit, charm, and proper fire, and the Virginia hostess never showed her
private feelings to a guest. She watched over the stranger's comfort with soft care, and met
his talk with graceful readiness. He spoke to her of her family: of her grandfather, whose
name had been widely known, of her father, whose praises he had heard sung, of Major Churchill,
whom he had met in Philadelphia in General Washington's time. He spoke of her kinsmen with
an admiration which went far toward including their opinions. Jacqueline marvelled. Surely
this gentleman was a Democrat-Republican, lately the Vice-President of that party's electing.
It was not two years since he had slain General Hamilton; and now, in a quiet, refined voice,
he was talking of Federalists and Federal ways with all the familiarity, sympathy, and ease
of one born in the fold and contented with his lot. She wondered if he had quarrelled with
his party, and while he was talking she was proudly thinking, "The Federalists will not have
him--no, not if he went on his knees to them!" And then she thought, "He is a man without a
country."

Rand sat somewhat silent and distrait, his mind occupied in building, building, now laying
the timbers this way and now that; but presently, upon his guest's referring to him some point
for elucidation, he entered the conversation, and thenceforth, though he spoke not a great
deal, his personality dominated it. The acute intelligence opposite him took faint alarm. "I
am bargaining for a supporter," Burr told himself, "not for a rival," and became if possible
more deferentially courteous than before. The talk went smoothly on, from Virginia politics
to the triumphal march of Napoleon through Europe; from England and the death of Pitt to the
Spanish intrigues, and so back to questions of the West; and to references, which Jacqueline
did not understand, to the Spanish Minister, Casa Yrujo, to the English Mr. Merry, and to Messieurs
Sauvé, Derbigny, and Jean Noël Destréhan of New Orleans.

Joab took away the Chelsea plates and dishes, brushed the mahogany, and placed before his master
squat decanters of sherry and Madeira. The flowing talk took a warmer tone, and began to sing
with the music of the South and the golden West; to be charged with Spanish, French, and Indian
names, with the odour of strange flowers, the roll of the Mississippi, and the flashing of
coloured wings. It was the two men now who spoke. Jacqueline, leaning back in her chair, half
listened to the talk of the Territory of Orleans, the Perdido, and the road to Mexico, half
dreamed of what they might be doing at Fontenoy this snowy night. The knocker sounded. "That
is Adam Gaudylock," exclaimed Rand. "Joab, show Mr. Gaudylock in."

Jacqueline rose, and Colonel Burr sprang to open the door for her. "We may sit late, Jacqueline,"
said Rand, and their guest, "Madam, I will make court to you in a court some day!"

Gaudylock's voice floated in from the hall: "Is a little man with him?--a black-eyed man?"
She passed into the drawing-room, and, pressing her brow against the window-pane, looked out
into the night. The snow had ceased to fall, and the moon was struggling with the breaking
clouds. The door opened to admit her husband, who came for a moment to her side. "It is not
snowing now," he said. "A visitor will hardly knock on such a night. If by chance one should
come, say that I am engaged with a client, make my excuses, and as soon as possible get rid
of him. On no account--on no account, Jacqueline, would I have it known that Aaron Burr is
here to-night. This is important. I will keep the doors shut, and we will not speak loudly."
He turned to go, then hesitated. "On second thoughts, I will tell Joab to excuse us both at
the door. For you--do not sit up, dear heart! It will be late before our business is done."

He was gone. Jacqueline went back to the fire and, sitting down beneath the high mantel, opened
the fifth volume of Clarissa Harlowe. She read for a while, then closed the book, and with
her chin in her hand fell to studying the ruddy hollows and the dropping coals. Perhaps half
an hour passed. The door opened, and she looked up from her picture in the deep hollows to
see Ludwell Cary smiling down upon her and holding out his hand. "Perhaps I should have drifted
past with the snow," he said, "but the light in the window drew me, and I heard to-day from
Fontenoy. Mr. Rand, I know, is at home."

"Yes," answered Jacqueline, rising, "but he is much engaged to-night with--with a friend. Did
Joab not tell you?"

"Mammy Chloe let me in. I did not see Joab. I am sorry--"

He hesitated. There came a blast of wind that rattled the boughs of the maple outside the window.
The fire leaped and the shadows danced in the corners of the room. Jacqueline knew that it
was cold outside--her visitor's coat was wet with snow. Sitting there before the fire she had
been lonely, and her heart was hungry for news from home.

"May I stay a few minutes?" asked Cary. "I will read you what Major Edward says of Fontenoy."

She was far from dreaming how little Rand would wish this visitor to know of his affairs that
night. Her knowledge extended no further than the fact that for some reason Colonel Burr did
not wish it known that he was in Richmond. She listened, but the walls were thick, and she
heard no sound from the distant dining-room. Cary would know only what she told him, and in
a few minutes he would be gone. "I should like to hear the letter," she said, and motioned
to the armchair beside the hearth. He took it, and she seated herself opposite him, upon an
old, embroidered tabouret. Between them the fire of hickory logs burned softly; without the
curtained windows the maple branches, moved by the wind, struck at intervals against the eaves.
Jacqueline faced the door. It was her intention, should she hear steps, to rise and speak to
Lewis in the hail without.

The letter which Cary drew from his breast pocket was from Major Churchill. That he did not
read it all was due to his correspondent's choice of subjects and great plainness of speech;
but he read what the Major had to say of Fontenoy, of the winter weather and the ailing slaves,
of Mustapha, of county deaths and marriages, of the books he had been reading, and the men
to whom he wrote. Major Edward's strain was ironic, fine, and very humanly lonely. Jacqueline's
eyes filled with tears, and all the flames of the fire ran together like shaken jewels.

"Almost all the rest," said Cary, "has to do with politics. I will not read you what he has
to say of us slight, younger men and the puny times in which we live. But this will interest
you--this is of general import."

He turned the page and read: "I have to-day a letter from G. Morris with the latest mischief
from the North. Aaron Burr is going West, but with, I warrant you, no thought of the setting
sun. The Ancient Iniquity in Washington smiles with thin lips and pronounces that all men and
Aaron Burr are unambitious, unselfish, and peace-loving--but none the less, he looks askance
at the serpent's windings. The friends of Burr are not the friends of Jefferson. There are
Federalists--'tis said they increase in numbers--who do not wish the former ill; myself I am
not of them. Colonel Burr desired that duel; he lay in wait for the affront which should be
his opportunity; he murdered Hamilton. He risked his own life--very true, the majority of murderers
do the same. The one who does not is a dastard in addition--voila tout!

"Burr quits the East, and all men know that the West, like Israel of old, is weary of an Idea
and would like to have a King. If the world revolves this way much longer, the Man of the People
will not be asked to write the next Declaration of Independence, and the country west of the
Ohio will be celebrating not the Fourth of July but an eighteenth Prairial. Aaron Burr and
his confederates intend an Empire. 'Tis said there are five hundred men in his confidence here
in the East, and that the chief of these wait but for a signal from him or from Wilkinson--whereupon
they'll follow him and he'll make them dukes and princes.

"Like Macbeth, he has done his murder and is on his way to be crowned at Scone. He has not
a wife, but he has a daughter ambitious as himself. She has a son. He sees his line secured.
He has suborned other murderers and made traitors of honest men--and our Laputa philosopher
at Washington smiles and says there is nothing amiss!

"May I be gathered soon out of this cap-and-bells democracy to some Walhalla where I may find
Hamilton and General Washington and be at peace! This world is growing wearisome to me.

"G. Morris speaks of the bulk of his news as report merely, but I'll stake my head the report
is true."

Cary ceased to read. Jacqueline sat motionless, and in the silence of the room they heard the
wind outside and the tapping of the maple branches.

"If I were Mr. Jefferson," said Cary presently, "I would arrest Colonel Burr this side of the
Ohio. He has been West too often; he is in the East now, and I would see to it that he remained
here. But Mr. Jefferson will temporize, and Burr will make his dash for a throne. Well! he
is neither Cæsar nor Buonaparte; he is only Aaron Burr. He is the adventurer, not the Emperor.
The danger is that in all the motley he is enlisting there may be a Buonaparte. Then farewell
to this poor schemer and any delusions he may yet nourish as to a peaceful, federated West!
War and brazen clamour and the yelling eagles of a conqueror!"

He spoke with conviction, but now, as though to lighten his own mood, he laughed. "All this
may not be so," he said. "It may be but a dream of our over-peaceful night."

Jacqueline rose, motioned him with a smile to keep his seat, and, moving to an escritoire standing
near the door, wrote a line upon a sheet of paper, then rang the bell and when Joab appeared,
put the paper into his hand. "Give this to your master," she said, and came back to Cary beside
the fire. She smiled, but he saw with concern that she was very pale, and that the amethysts
were trembling at her throat. "I should not have read you this letter," he exclaimed. "It is
over-caustic, over-bitter. Do not let it trouble you. You have grown pale!"

She bent over the fire as if she were cold. "It is nothing. Yes, I was troubled--I am always
troubled when I think of Fontenoy. But it is over now--and indeed I wanted to hear Uncle Edward's
letter." She straightened herself and turned to him a smiling face. "And now tell me of yourself!
You are looking worn. Men work too hard in Richmond. Oh, for the Albemarle air! The snow will
be white to-morrow on my fir tree, and Deb will have to throw crumbs for the birds. I have
learned a new song. When next you come, I will sing it to you."

"Will you not," asked Cary,--"will you not sing it to me now?"

She shook her head. "Not now. How the branches strike against the roof to-night!"

As she spoke she moved restlessly, and Cary saw the amethysts stir again. A thought flashed
through his mind. It had to do with Lewis Rand, of whom he often thought, sometimes with melancholy
envy, sometimes with strong dislike, sometimes with unwilling admiration, and always with painful
curiosity. Now, the substance of Major Churchill's letter strongly in mind, with senses rendered
more acute and emotions heightened as they always were in the presence of the woman he had
not ceased to love, troubled, too, by something in her demeanor, intangibly different from
her usual frank welcome, he suddenly and vividly recalled a much-applauded speech that Rand
had made three days before in a public gathering. It had included a noteworthy display of minute
information of western conditions, extending to the physical features of the country and to
every degree of its complex population. One sentence among many had caught Cary's attention,
had perplexed him, and had remained in his memory to be considered afterwards, closely and
thoughtfully. There was one possible meaning--

Cary crumpled the letter in his hand. Rand's speech perplexed him no longer. That was it--that
was it! His breath came quickly. He had builded better--he had builded better than he knew,
when he wrote that paper signed "Aurelius"!

With fingers that were not quite steady he smoothed and refolded Major Churchill's letter He
was saying to himself, "What does she know She grew pale Thou suspicious fool! That was for
thought of home He will have told her nothing--nothing! Her soul is clear."

He pocketed his letter and, rising, spoke to her with a chivalrous gentleness "I will go now
Do not let the thought of Fontenoy distress you Do you remember the snow man we made there
once, wreathing his head with holly? But I'll tell you a strange thing,--even on such a night
as this, I always see Fontenoy bathed in summer weather!"

"Yes, yes," she answered "I, too. Oh, home!"

He held out his hand "You'll give my compliments to Mr. Rand?"

"Yes," she said. "He is busy to-night with a client from the country. He works too hard."

"Take him soon to Roselands and tie him there. Sing him To Althea and make him forget." He
bent and kissed her hand. "Good-night--good-night!"

"Good-night," she answered, and moved with him to the door. Standing there, she watched him
through the hail and out of the house, then turned and, going to the window, pressed her brow
against the pane and watched him down the street. The night had cleared; there was a high wind
and many stars.

In Rand's dining-room the three men sat late over the wine and the questions that had brought
them together, but at last the conference was somewhat stormily over. Burr and Adam Gaudylock
left the house together, the hunter volunteering to guide the stranger to his inn. It was midnight,
and Colonel Burr did not see his hostess. He sent her courtly messages, and he pressed Rand's
hand somewhat too closely, then with his most admirable military air and frankest smile, thrust
his arm through Gaudylock's and marched away. Rand closed the door, put down the candle that
he held, and turned into the drawing-room.

Before the dying fire he found Jacqueline in her white gown, the amethysts about her throat,
and her scarf of silver gauze fallen from her hand upon the floor. In her young face and form
there should have been no hint, no fleeting breath of tragedy, but to-night there was that
hint and that breath. The fire over which she bent and brooded seemed to leave her cold. The
room was no longer brightly lighted, and she appeared mournfully a part of the hovering shadows.
Her spirit had power to step forth and clothe the flesh. Almost always she looked the thing
she felt. Now, in the half light, bent above the fading coals, she looked old. Her husband,
with his hand upon the mantel-shelf, gazed down upon her. "It was wise of you to send me that
note. Burr and I might have walked in here, or we might have spoken loudly. I heard Cary when
he went out. How did you manage?"

"He asked for you. I told him that you were engaged with a client from the country. Oh, Lewis!"

Rand stooped and kissed her. "It was the best thing you could say. I would not have had him
guess our visitor to-night. You are trembling like a leaf!"

"The best that I could say!--I don't know that. I feel like a leaf in the wind! I did not understand--but
I was afraid for you. It is done, but I prefer to tell the truth!"

"I prefer it for you," said Rand. "To-night was mere unluckiness. And he suspected nothing?"

"He went without knowing who was in the dining-room. Lewis, what is there to suspect?"

He stood looking down upon her with a glow in his dark eyes and an unwonted red in his cheek.
"Suspect? There is nothing to suspect. But to expect--there might be expectations, my Queen!"

"As long as you live you are my King" she said. "To-night I am afraid for my King. I do not
like Colonel Burr!"

"I am sorry for that. He is said to be a favourite with women."

"Lewis!" she cried, "what does he want with you? Tell me!"

So appealing was her voice, so urgent the touch of her hand, that with a start Rand awoke from
his visions to the fact of her emotion. His eye was hawklike, and his intuition unfailing.
"What did Ludwell Cary say to you?" he demanded.

She took her scarf from the floor, wound her hands in it, and clasped them tightly before her.
"When I told him,--Mammy Chloe let him in,--when I told him that you were busy with your client,
he thought no more of it. And then we talked of Fontenoy, and he read me a letter from Uncle
Edward. Much of the letter was about Colonel Burr, and--and suspicions that were aroused. Uncle
Edward called him a traitor and a maker of traitors. That is an ugly name, is it not? Ludwell
Cary did not think the rumour false. He said that if he were Mr. Jefferson, he would arrest
Colonel Burr. He, also, called him traitor. I can tell you what he said.

There was a silence, then Rand spoke in a curious voice, "Saul among the prophets! In the future,
let us have less of Ludwell Cary."

"Lewis, why did Colonel Burr come here to-night?"

Rand turned from the fire and began to pace the room, head bent and hand at mouth, thinking
rapidly. His wife raised her hands, still wrapped in the silver scarf, to her heart, and waited.
As he passed for the third time the tall harp, he drew his hand heavily across the strings.
The room vibrated to the sound. Rand came back to the hearth, took the armchair in which Cary
had sat, and drew it closer to the glowing embers. "Come," he said. "Come, Jacqueline, let
us look at the pictures in the fire."

She knelt beside him on the braided rug. "Show me true pictures! Home in Virginia, and honourable
life, and noble service, and my King a King indeed, and this Colonel Burr gone like a shadow
and an ugly dream!--that is the picture I want to see."

For a moment there was silence before the white ash and the dying heart of the wood, then Rand
with the tongs squared a flaky bed and drew from top to bottom a jagged line. "This," he said,
"is the great artery; this is the Mississippi River." He drew another line. "Here to the southwest
is Mexico, and that is a country for great dreams. There the plantain and the orange grow and
there are silver and gold--and the warm gulf is on this side, and the South Sea far, far away,
and down here is South America. The Aztecs lived in Mexico, and Cortez conquered them. He burned
his ships so that he and his Spaniards might not retreat. Here is the land west of the Mississippi,
unknown and far away. There are grassy plains that seem to roll into the sun, and there are
great herds of game, and warlike Indians, and beyond the range of any vision there are vast
mountains white with snow. Gold, too, may be there. It is a country enormous, grandiose, rich,
and silent,--a desert waiting dumbly for the strong man's tread." He turned a little and drew
another line. "To this side, away, away to the east, here where you and I are sitting, watching,
watching, here are the Old Thirteen,--the Thirteen that the English took from the Indians,
that the children of the English took from England. It is the law of us all, Jacqueline, the
law of the Three Kingdoms: the battle is to the strong and the race to the swift. The Old Thirteen
are stable; let them rest! Together they make a great country, and they will be greater yet
But here is the Ohio--la belle Rivière, the Frenchmen call it. And beyond and below the Ohio,
through all the gigantic valley of a river so great that it seems a fable, south to New Orleans,
and westward to the undiscovered lies the country that is to be! And Napoleon, in order that
he may brandish over England one thunderbolt the more, sells it for a song!--and we buy it
for a song--and not one man in fifty guesses that we have bought the song of the future! The
man who bought it knows its value--but Mr. Jefferson cares only for Done lays. He'll not have
the Phrygian. He dreams of cotton and olives, of flocks and herds, rock salt and peaceful mines,
and the manors of the Golden Age,--all gathered, tended, worked, administered by farmers, school-teachers,
and philosophers! The ploughshare (improved) and the pruning-hook, a pulpit for Dr. Priestley,
and a statue of Tom Paine, a glass house where the study of the mastodon may lead to a knowledge
of man, slavery abolished, and war abhorred, the lion and the lamb to lie down together and
Rousseau to come true--all the old mirage--perfectibility in plain sight! That is his dream,
and it is a noble one. There is no room in it for the wicked man. In the mean time he proposes
to govern this land of milk and honey, this bought-and-paid-for Paradise, very much as an eastern
Despot might govern a conquered province. The inconsistencies of man must disconcert even the
Thinker up in the skies. Well--it happens that the West and this great new city of ours, there
at the mouth of the river, with her levees and her ships, her merchants, priests, and lawyers,
do not want government by a satrap. They want an Imperial City and a Cæsar of their own. Throughout
the length and breadth of this vast territory there is deep dissatisfaction--within and without,
for Spain is yet arrogant upon its borders. The Floridas--Mexico--fret and fever everywhere!
It is so before all changes, Jacqueline. The very wind sighs uneasily. Then one comes, bolder
than the rest, sees and takes his advantage. So empires and great names are made."

"So good names are lost!" she cried. "It is not thus that you spoke one October evening on
our way from Albemarle!"

Rand dropped the iron from his hand. "That was a year and a half ago, and all things move with
rapidity. A man's mind changes. That evening!--I was in Utopia. And yet, if we reigned,--if
we two reigned, Jacqueline,--we might reign like that. We might make a kingdom wise and great."

"And Mr. Jefferson, and all that you owe to him? And your letter to him every month with all
the public news?"

"That was before this winter," he answered. "We have almost ceased to write. I am not like
James Madison or James Monroe. I cannot follow always. Mr. Jefferson is a great man--but it
is hungry dwelling in the shadow of another."

"Better dwell in the shadow forever," cried Jacqueline, with passion, "than to reign with faithlessness
in the sun!"

"I am not faithless--"

"So Benedict Arnold thought! Oh, Lewis!"

"You speak," said Rand slowly, "too much like the Churchills and the Carys."

In the silence that followed, Jacqueline rose and stood over against him, the scarf trailing
from her hand and the amethysts rising and falling with her laboured breathing. He glanced
at her and then went on: "Burr leaves Richmond to-morrow. He does not go West till summer,
and all his schemes may come to naught. What he does or does not do will depend on many things,
chiefly on whether or not we go to war with Spain. I am not going West with him--not yet. I
have let him talk. I have brought him and Adam Gaudylock together; I have put a little money
in this land purchase of his upon the Washita, and I have given him some advice. That is all
there is of rebellion, treason, and sedition,--all the cock-a-hoop story! Ludwell Cary may
keep his own breath to cool his own porridge. And you, Jacqueline, you who married me, you
have not a soul to be frighted with big words! You and I shall walk side by side."

"Shall we?" she said. "That will depend. I'll not walk with you over the dead--dead faith,
dead hope, dead honour!"

"I shall not ask you to," he answered. "You are not yourself. You are using words without thought.
It is the cold, the lateness, and this dying fire--Ludwell Cary's arrogance as well. Dead faith,
hope, honour!--is this your trust, your faith?"

"Lewis, Lewis!"

He rose, crossed the shadowy space between them, and took her hands. "Don't fear--don't fear!
We two will always love. Jacqueline, there is that within me that will not rest, that cries
for power, and that overrides obstacles! See what I have overridden since the days beneath
the apple tree! I am not idly dreaming. Conditions such as exist to-day will not arise again.
Upon this continent it is the time of times for the bold--the wisely bold. This that beckons
is no mirage in the West; it is palpable fact. Say that I follow Burr--follow! overtake and
pass him! He has a tarnished name and fifty years,--a supple rapier but a shrunken arm. He's
daring; but I can be that and more. He plans; I can achieve. I am no dreamer and no braggart
when I say that in the West I can play the Corsican. What can I do here? Become, perhaps, Governor
of Virginia; wait until Mr. Jefferson is dead, and Mr. Madison is dead, and Mr. Monroe is dead,
and then, if the world is yet Republican, become President? The governorship I do not want;
the presidency is but a chance, and half a lifetime off! But this--this, Jacqueline, is real
and at hand. Say that I go, say that I gain a throne where you and I may sit and rule, wise
and great and sovereign, holding kingdoms for our children--"

"Oh!" exclaimed Jacqueline.

Rand drew her to him. "Don't fear--don't fear! The child will come--we want him so!"

"Promise me," she cried,--"promise me that you will see Colonel Burr no more, write to him
no more! Promise me that you will put all this away, forever, forever! Oh, Lewis, give me your
word!"

"I will do nothing rash," he said. "We will go back to Roselands,--we will watch and wait awhile.
Burr himself does not go West until the summer. Ere then I will persuade you. That first July
evening, under the mimosa at the gate, even then this thing was vaguely, vaguely in my mind."

"Was it?" she cried. "Oh me, oh me!"

"You are wearied," he said, "chilled and trembling. I wish that Ludwell Cary had aired his
views elsewhere to-night! Put it all from your mind and come to rest--"

"Lewis, if ever you loved me--if ever you said that you would give me proof--"

"You know that I love you."

"Then, as I gave up friends and home for you, give up this thing for me! No, no, I'll not cease
to beg"--She slipped from his arm to her knees. "Lewis, Lewis, this is not the road--this is
not the way to freedom, goodness, happiness Promise me! Oh, Lewis, if ever you loved me, promise
me!"

From Rand's house on Shockoe Hill Ludwell Cary walked quickly homeward to the Eagle, where
he and his brother lodged. As he walked he thought at first, hotly and bitterly enough, of
Lewis Rand and painfully of himself, but at length the solemnity of the white night and the
high glitter of the stars made him impatient of his own mood. He looked at the stars, and at
the ivory and black of the tall trees, and his mind calmed itself and turned to think of Jacqueline.

In the Eagle's best bedroom, before a blazing fire and a bottle of port, he found Fairfax Cary
deep in a winged chair and a volume of Fielding. "Well, Fair?" he said, with his arm upon the
mantel-shelf and his booted foot upon the fender.

The younger Cary closed his book and hospitably poured wine for his brother. "Were you at the
Amblers'?" he asked. "It's a night for one's own fireside. I went to the Mayos', but the fair
Maria is out of town. On the way I stopped at Bowler's Tavern to see his man about that filly
we were talking of, and I had a glass with old Bowler himself. He let out a piece of news.
Who d'ye think is in town and under Bowler's roof?--Aaron Burr!"

There was a silence, then Cary said quietly, "Aren't you mistaken, Fair?"

"Not in the least," answered the other. "He came in a sloop from Baltimore yesterday. It is
not known that he's in town; he does not want it known. He's keeping quiet,--perhaps he has
another duel on his conscience. I don't believe old Bowler knew he had let the cat out. Burr
leaves to-morrow. He was out visiting to-night."

"How do you know that?" Cary demanded, with sudden sharpness.

"Bowler's best bedroom in darkness--no special preparations for supper--Burr's man idling in
the kitchen--mine host taking no cake to speak low,--in short, the wedding guest was roaming.
I wonder where he was!"

The elder Cary raised and drained the glass of wine. He knew where Aaron Burr had supped and
passed the evening, and a coldness that was not of the night crept upon him. As for Lewis Rand,
he cared not what he did nor why he did it, but for Jacqueline Churchill. This had been the
client from the country! All the time she was keeping it secret that Burr was there. She had
turned pale. No wonder!--the faithful wife!

"Take care, that glass is thin--you'll break it!" warned the younger Cary, but the glass had
snapped in the elder's fingers.

"Pshaw!" said Cary; "too frail for use! I'm off to bed, Fair. That bill comes up to-morrow,
and it means a bitter fight. Good-night,--and I say, Fair, hold your tongue about Aaron Burr.
Good-night!"

In his room he put out the candle, parted the window curtains, and looked upon Orion, icily
splendid in the midnight sky. "What is there that is steadfast?" he thought. "Does she love
him so?" He stood for a long time looking out into the night. He thought of that evening at
Fontenoy when he had come in from the sultry and thunderous air and had found Rand seated in
the drawing-room and Jacqueline at her harp, singing To Althea,--

     "Minds innocent and quiet take
        That for a hermitage."

The words and the vision of Fontenoy that night were yet with him when at last he turned from
the window and threw himself upon the bed, where he finally fell asleep with his arm flung
up and across his eyes.

CHAPTER XVI

AT LYNCH'S

Rand, walking hastily through the hail of the Capitol, came out into the portico. Before him,
between the great pillars, the landscape showed in glittering silver, in the brown of leafless
trees and the hard green of pine and fir. The hill fell steep and white to the houses at its
base and to the trampled street. In the still and crystal air the river made itself plainly
heard. Across, on the Chesterfield side, the woods formed a long smudge of umber against the
blue of the afternoon sky.

There were people here in the open air as there had been in the corridor, a number of men talking
loudly, or excitedly whispering, or in silence rolling triumph beneath the tongue, or digesting
defeat. Rand's progress, here as there, brought a change. The loud talking fell, the whisperers
turned, the silent found their voices, and there arose a humming note of recognition and tribute.
Rand had carried the Albemarle Resolutions, and that with a high hand. He moved through the
crowd, acknowledging with a bend of his head this or that man's salute, frankly smiling upon
good friends, and finely unconscious of all enemies, until at the head of the broad steps he
came upon Adam Gaudylock seated with his gun beside him, smoking reflectively in the face of
the Albemarle Resolutions and the general excitement. At Rand's glance he rose, took up the
gun, and slid the pipe into his beaded pouch. The two descended the steps together.

"I am going to Lynch's," said Rand. "The stage will soon be in and I want the news. Well?"

"He's off," answered Gaudylock. "Chaise to Fredericksburg at six this morning. Pitch dark and
no one stirring, and he as chipper, fresh, and pleased as a squirrel with a nut! Pshaw! a Creek
pappoose could read his trail! He's from New England anyway. I want a Virginian out there!"

They walked on down the white hillside. The hunter, tawny and light of tread, scarce older
to the eye, for all his wanderings, than the man beside him, glanced aslant with his sea-blue
eyes. "When are you coming, Lewis?"

"Never, I think," said Rand abruptly; then after a moment's silent walking, "They should better
clean these paths of snow. Mocket says a brig came in yesterday from the Indies;--attacks on
Neutral Trade and great storms at sea. I've a pipe of Madeira on the ocean that I hope will
not go astray. I wish that some time you would send me by a wagon coming east antlers of elk
for the hall at Roselands."

"Why, certainly!" quoth Gaudylock. "And so you are going to settle down like every other country
gentleman,--safe and snug, winter and summer, fenced in by tobacco and looking after negroes?
I'll send you the skin of a grizzly, too."

"Thank you," replied Rand; then presently, "I dreamed last night--when at last I got to sleep--of
my father. Do you remember how he used to stride along with his black hair and his open shirt
and his big stick in his hand? I used to think that stick a part of him--just his arm made
long and heavy. I tried once to burn it when he was asleep. Ugh!"

"I dreamed," said Gaudylock imperturbably, "of a Shawnee girl who once wanted me to stay in
her father's lodge. 'It is winter in the forest,' quoth she, 'and the wolves begin to howl.
All your talk of places where the river runs through flowers and the pale faces build great
villages is the talk of singing birds! Stay by the fire, Golden-tongue!' and I stayed--in the
dream.

     "When you see a partridge
       Scurrying through the grass,
     Fit an arrow to the bow,
       For a man will pass!

"Heigho!"

"I am already," retorted Rand, "at the place where the river runs through flowers and the pale
faces have built villages. Who will say that I did not cross the forest?--I was years in crossing
it! Here is Lynch's."

The coffee house on Main Street was the resort of lawyers, politicians, and strangers in town,
and towards dusk, when the stage and post-rider were in, a crowded and noisy place. It was
yet early when Rand and Gaudylock entered, and neither the mail-bag, nor many habitués of the
place had arrived. The room was quiet and not over brightly lit by the declining sun and the
flare of a great, crackling fire. There were a number of tables and a few shadowy figures sipping
chocolate, wine, or punch. Rand led the way to a corner table, and, sitting down with his back
to the room, beckoned a negro and ordered wine. "I am tired, voice and mind," he said to Gaudylock,
"and I know you well enough to neglect you. Let us sit still till the papers come."

He drank his wine and, with his elbow on the table, rested his forehead upon his hand and closed
his eyes. Adam emptied his glass, then, leaning back in his corner, surveyed the room. Two
men came and seated themselves at a neighbouring table. They were talking in lowered voices,
but Gaudylock's ears were exceedingly keen. "A great speech!" said one. "As great as Mr. Henry
ever made. Do you remember old Gideon Rand?"

The other shrugged. "Yes; and I remember old Stephen Rand, Gideon's father--a pirate of a man,
sullen, cruel, and revengeful! A black stock!"

"The Waynes were not angels either--save by comparison," quoth the first. "All the same it
was a great speech."

"I grant you that," said the other. "Black stock or not, we'll see him Governor of Virginia.
Curious, isn't it?"

They became aware of their neighbours, glanced uneasily at each other, raised their eyebrows,
and changed to a distant table. Rand made no sign of having heard. He put out his hand to the
Burgundy, filled his glass, and drank it slowly, then closed his eyes again. A figure, half
buried in the settle by the fire, folded a month-old journal and, rising, displayed in the
light from the hickory logs the faded silk stockings, the velvet short-clothes, brocaded coat,
and curled wig of M. Achille Pincornet, who taught dancing each winter in Richmond, as in summer
he taught it in Albemarle. Mr. Pincornet, snuff-box and handkerchief in hand, looked around
him, saw the two at the corner table, and crossed to them. "Mr. Rand, I make you my compliments.
I was in the gallery. Ah, eloquence, eloquence!--substance persuasively put! Minerva with the
air of Venus! I, too, was eloquent in my day! Pray honour me!"

Rand touched the extended snuff-box with his fingers, muttered an absent word or two, and again
sank into revery. Mr. Pincornet, with an affable, "Ah, hunter!" to Gaudylock, passed on to
greet an entering compatriot, the good Abbé Dubois.

Rand sat still, his head propped upon one hand, the fingers of the other moving upon the board
before him, half aimlessly, half deliberately, as though he wrote in a dream. Opposite him
rested Adam, placid as an eastern god. The room began to fill and the murmur of voices to deepen.
"The Red Deer is late," affirmed some one. "Damned heavy roads!"

"Then they've sent on a rider!" cried another. "Here's Lynch's man with the bag!"

It being the custom to address letters, papers, and pamphlets to gentlemen at "Lynch's Coffee
House," there was now a general movement of interest and expectation. A negro carrying a pair
of saddle-bags advanced, obsequious and smiling, to a high desk at one side of the room and
placed thereon the news from the outer world The genial Mr Lynch, proprietor of the establishment,
took his place behind the desk with due solemnity, and a score of lawyers, merchants, and planters
left tobacco, wine, julep, and toddy to press around his temporary throne. Every day at this
hour Lynch mounted this height, and he dearly loved the transient importance. Now he solemnly
unfastened the bags, drew out a great handful of matter, looked it over, amid laughing clamour,
with pursed lips and one raised, deprecating hand, then in a cheerful, wheezing voice began
to call out names,--"Major Du Val--Major Baker--Mr. Allan--Mr. Munford--Mr. Chavallie--Colonel
Harvie--Major Gibbon--Dr. Foushee--Mr. Warrington--Major Willis--Mr. Wickham--Mr. Rand--"

There was a moment's check while Lynch craned his neck. "Mr. Rand's not here, I believe?"

"Lewis Rand,--no!" quoth Mr. Wickham. "What should he do in a mere coffee house with mere earthly
newspapers? He's walking somewhere in a laurel garden in the cool of the evening."

Rand's voice came out of the depths of the room that was now just light enough to see the written
word. "I am here, Mr. Lynch." He rose and came forward. "Good-afternoon, gentlemen--good-afternoon,
Mr. Wickham!"

"Did you hear?" asked Wickham coolly. "Well, it is a laurel garden, you know! Mr. Lynch, let's
have candles--"

"Yes, sir," said Mr. Lynch. "Colonel Ambler--Mr. Carrington--Mr. Rutherfoord--Mr. Page--Mr.
Cary--Mr. Fairfax Cary--"

"They are coming later," said a voice.

"Thank you, Mr. Mason--Mr. Carter--Mr. Call--Mr. Cabell--the Abbé Dubois-"

The list went on. Candles were lighted on every table and on the mantel-shelf, though outside
the windows the west was yet red. Two negroes brought and tossed into the cavernous fireplace
a mighty backlog of hickory. The sound of the fire mingled with the rustle of large thin sheets
of paper, the crisp turning of Auroras, National Intelligencers, Alexandria Expositors, Gazettes
of the United States, excited journals of an excited time, with softly uttered interjections
and running comment, and with now and then a high, clear statement of fact or rumour. At home,
the hour's burning question was that of English and Spanish depredation at sea, attack upon
neutral ships, confiscation and impressment of American sailors. In Washington, the resolutions
of Gregg and Nicholson were under consideration, and all things looked toward the Embargo of
a year later. Abroad, the sign in the skies was still Napoleon--Napoleon--Napoleon! Now, at
Lynch's, as the crowd increased and the first absorbed perusal of script and print gave way
to exchange of news and heated discussion, the room began to ring with voices. Broken sentences,
words, and talismanic phrases danced as thick as motes in a sunbeam. "Non-Importation.... Gregg....
Too wholesale.... Nicholson.... Silk, window-glass.... Napoleon.... Brass, playing-cards, books,
prints, beer, and ale.... Napoleon.... The Essex of Salem, the Enoch and Rowena.... Texas--the
seizure of Texas. Two millions for the Floridas.... The Death of Pitt.... Napoleon--Austerlitz....
'Decius' in the Enquirer--that's John Randolph of Roanoke.... 'Aurelius'--that letter of 'Aurelius'--"

Rand, at the corner table, had moved his chair so as to face the room. Letters and papers were
spread before him; he had broken the seal of a thin blue sheet and drawn a candle close to
the fine, neat, and pointed writing. The letter interested him, and he apparently took no heed
of the rapid disjointed speech around him. But the word "Aurelius" brought a sudden, darting
glance, a movement of the lower lip, and a stiffening of the shoulders. Gaudylock, who sat
and smoked, supremely indifferent to the display of newspapers, marked the flicker of emotion.
"He sees a snake in the grass," he thought lazily "Who's 'Aurelius'?"

Rand turned the thin blue page, snuffed the candle, and fell again to his reading. Right and
left the talk continued. "Glass, tin.... The Albemarle Resolutions. Great speech. He's over
there.... All this talk about Aaron Burr.... Austerlitz--twenty thousand Russians.... Westwood
the coiner got clean away on a brig for Martinique. One villain the less here, one the more
in Martinique. Martinique! that's where the Empress Josephine comes from--"

"My faith!" said Adam. "It's worse than the mockingbirds in June!"

The doors opened and the two Carys entered the coffee room. Rand lifted his eyes for a moment,
then let them fall to the third sheet of his letter. Mr. Lynch bustled forward. "Ha, Mr. Cary,
your letters are waiting! Mr. Fairfax Cary,--your servant, sir!--Eli, wine for Mr. Cary--the
Madeira. Christopher, more wood to the fire! The night is falling cold."

"Very cold, Mr. Lynch," said Ludwell Cary. "Colonel Ambler--Mr. Wickham, we meet again!"--and
his brother, "We never have such cold in Albemarle, Mr. Lynch! Ha, your fire is good, and your
wine's good, and your company's good. There's a table by the fire, Ludwell."

They moved to it, exchanging greetings, as they went, with half the room, sat down, drank each
a glass of wine, and fell to their letters, careless of the surrounding war of words. The elder's
mail was heavy,--letters from London, from New York, from Philadelphia, one from his overseer
at Greenwood, others from clients, colleagues, and strangers,--all the varied correspondence
of the lawyer, the planter, and the man of the world. Fairfax Cary's letters were fewer in
number, but one was gilt-edged, curiously folded, and superscribed in a strong and delicate
hand. "Miss Dandridge seals with a dove and an olive branch?" murmured the elder brother. "Lucky
Fair! What's the frown for?"

"Olive branch?" quoth the other. "She should seal with a nettle! Listen to this: 'Mr. Hunter
has been some time with us at Fontenoy. Mr. Carter spent his Christmas here--he dances extremely
well. Mr. Page gives us now and then the pleasure of his company. He turns the leaves of my
music for me. Mr. Lee and I are reading Sir Charles Grandison together. I see Mr. Nelson at
Saint Anne's.' Saint Anne! Saint Griselda! Her letters are enough to make a man renounce the
world, the flesh, and the devil, and turn Trappist--"

"I wish the room would turn Trappist," said the other. "I am tired of talk. I would like to
be somewhere in the woods to-night--quiet. We won't stay long here. There has been contention
enough to-day."

The younger leaned forward. "Lewis Rand is over there--three tables back."

"I know. I saw him when we came in. Read your letters and we will be gone."

The minutes passed. Outside Lynch's the western red faded, and the still, winter night came
quickly on. Within, fire and candles burned bright, but to not a few of Mr. Lynch's patrons
the flames danced unsteadily. It was an age of hard drinking; the day had been an exciting
one, and Lynch's wine or punch or apple toddy but the last of many potations. The assemblage
was assuredly not drunken, but neither was it, at this hour and after the emotional wear and
tear of the past hours, quite sane or less than hectic. Its mood was edged. Now, in the quarter
of an hour before the general start for home and supper, foreign and federal affairs gave way
to first-hand matters and a review of the day that was closing. It had been a field day. The
city of Richmond was strongly Federal, the General Assembly mainly Republican. At Lynch's this
evening were members, Federalist and Republican, of the two Houses, with citizens, planters,
visitors enough of either principle. When the general talk turned upon the Albemarle Resolutions
and the morning's proceedings in the House of Delegates, it was as though an invisible grindstone
had put upon the moment a finer edge.

Lewis Rand, sweeping his letters and papers together, had nodded to Adam and moved from his
table to that of a pillar of the Republican party, with whom he was now in attentive discourse.
Apparently he gave no heed to the voices around him, though he might have heard his own name,
seeing that wherever the talk now turned it came at last upon his speech of that morning. Presently,
"Mr. Rand!" called some one from across the room.

Rand turned. "Mr. Harrison?"

"Mr. Rand, there's a dispute here. Just what did you mean by--" and there followed a quotation
from the morning's speech.

Rand moistened his lips with wine, turned more fully in his chair, and answered in a sentence
of such pith as to bring applause from those of his party who heard. In a moment there was
another query, then a third; he was presently committed to a short and vigorous exposition
and defence of the point in question. The entire room became attentive. Then, as he paused,
the strident voice of a noted and irascible man proclaimed, "That's not democracy and not Jefferson--that
doctrine, Mr. Rand. Veil her as you please in gauze and tinsel, you've got conquest by the
hand. You may not think it, but you're preaching--what's the word that 'Aurelius' used?--'Buonapartism.'"

A Federalist of light weight who had arrived at quarrelsomeness and an empty bottle put in
a sudden oar. "'Buonapartism' equals Ambition, and both begin with an R." He looked pointedly
at Rand.

"My name begins with an R, sir," said Rand.

"Pshaw! so does mine!" exclaimed the man at the table with him. "Let him alone, Rand. He doesn't
know what he is saying."

Rand turned to the first speaker. "'Buonapartism,'--that's a word that's as ample as Charity,
but I hardly think, sir, that it covers this case. It's a very vague word. But writers to the
Gazette are apt to be more fluent than accurate."

"I shouldn't call it vague," cried his opponent. "It's a damned good word, and so I'd tell
'Aurelius,' if I knew who he was."

"It wasn't random firing in that letter," said a voice from another quarter of the room. "I
don't much care to know the gunner, but I'd mightily like to know who was aimed at. It was
a damned definite thing, that letter. 'Buonapartism--the will to mount--sacrifice of obligations--Genius
prostituted to Ambition--sin against light--a man's betrayal of his highest self and his own
belief--the mind's incurable blindness--I, I am above all law--to take rich gifts and hold
the gods in contempt--Dædalus wings'"--The speaker paused to fill his glass. "Yes, I should
powerfully like to know at whom 'Aurelius' was aiming."

"At no one, I think," said Rand coolly. "He made a scarecrow of his own, and then was frightened
by it. His chain-shot raked a man of straw,--and so would I tell 'Aurelius,' if I knew who he was."

As he spoke, he moved to face the fire. He had not raised his voice, but he had given it carrying
quality. Cary raised his eyes, and laid down the paper he had in his hand. A genial, down-river
planter and magistrate entered the conversation. "Well, I for one don't hold with all this
latter-day hiding behind names out of Roman history! Brutus and Cato and Helvidius, Decius
and Aurelius, and all the rest of them! Is a man ashamed of his English name?"

"Or afraid?" said Rand, then bit his lip. He had not meant to carry things so far, but the
pent-up anger had its way at last. His mind was weary and tense, irritable from two sleepless
nights and from futile decisions, and he inherited a tendency to black and sudden rage. It
was true he had walked through life with a black dog at his heels. Sometimes he turned, closed
with, throttled, and flung off his pursuer; sometimes he left him far behind; more than once
he had seen him mastered and done with, dead by the wayside, had drawn free breath, and had
gone on with a victor's brow. Then, when all the fields were smiling, came at a bound the dark
shape, leaped at the throat, and hung there. It was so this evening at Lynch's. He strove with
his passion, but he was aware of a wish to strive no longer, to let the black dog have his way.

There was a laugh for the speaker before him. "You see, sir," cried a noted lawyer, "Brutus
and Cato, Helvidius, Decius, and Aurelius, and all the noble Romans died before duelling came
in! 'Sir, the editor of the--ahem!--newspaper, I take exception to this statement in your pages.'
'Sir, I refer you to Junius Brutus. Answer, Roman!' Never a sound from Limbo!--'Sir, Decius
has grossly misrepresented. Where shall I send my challenge?' 'To Hades, no less! Not the least
use in knocking up John Randolph of Roanoke.'--'Sir, I am at odds with Aurelius. Pray favour
me with the gentleman's address.' 'Sir, he left no name. You see, he lived so long ago!'"

Amid the laugh that followed, Cary turned a smiling face upon the speaker. "I will answer,
Mr. Wickham, for Aurelius. Do you really want to challenge me?" He slightly changed his position
so as to confront Rand's table. "In this instance, Mr. Rand, I am certain there was no fear."

His speech, heard of all, wrought in various ways. Mocket the day before had not exaggerated
the general interest in the letter signed "Aurelius." Now at Lynch's there arose a small tumult
of surprise, acclaim, enthusiasm, and dissent. His friends broke into triumph, his political
enemies--he had few others--strove for a deeper frown and a growling note. The only indifferent
in Lynch's was Adam Gaudylock, who smoked tranquilly on, not having read the letter in question
nor being concerned with Roman history. Lewis Rand sat in silence with compressed lips, bodily
there in the lit coffee room, but the inner man far away on the mind's dark plains, struggling
with the fiend that dogged him. Fairfax Cary's cheek glowed and his eyes shone. He looked at
his brother, then poured a glass of wine and raised it to his lips. "Wait, Fairfax! We'll all
drink with you!" cried a neighbour. "Gentlemen and Federalists, glasses!--Ludwell Cary, and
may he live to hear his children's children read 'Aurelius'!"

The Federalists drank the toast with acclaim, while the Republicans with equal ostentation
did no such thing. Mr. Pincornet in his corner, hearing the words "Gentlemen" and "Cary," drank
with gusto his very thin wine, and Adam drank because he had always liked the Carys and certainly
had no grudge against "Aurelius," whoever he might be.

In the first lull of sound the man at the table with Lewis Rand spoke in a loud, harsh, but
agreeable voice. "Well, Mr. Cary, the staunchest of Republicans, though he can't drink that
toast, need not deny praise to a masterpiece of words. Words, sir, not facts. What I want to
know is at whom--not at what, at whom--you were firing? I thought once that Aaron Burr was
your mark. But he's too light metal--a mere buccaneer! That broadside of yours would predicate
a general foe--and I'm damned if I wouldn't like to know his name!"

"We would all like to know his name," said Rand. "And when we know it, I for one would like
to hear Mr. Cary's proofs of faithlessness to obligations."

In the hush of expectation which fell upon the room the eyes of the two men met. In Rand's
there was something cold and gleaming, something that was not his father's nor his grandfather's,
but his own, deadly but markedly courageous. Cary's look was more masked, grave, and collected,
with the merest quiver of the upper lip. In the mind of each the curtain strangely lifted,
not upon Richmond or Fontenoy or the Court House at Charlottesville, but upon a long past day
and the Albemarle woods and two boys gathering nuts together. This lasted but an instant, then
Cary spoke. "In that letter, Judge Roane, 'Aurelius' had no thought of Aaron Burr. I doubt
if in writing he meant to give to any image recognizable face and form. I think that, very
largely, he believed himself but personifying the powers of evil and the tendencies thereto
inherent in the Democrat-Republican as in all human doctrine. If he builded better than he
knew, if he held the mirror up, if, in short, there's any whom the cap fits"--He paused a moment,
then said sternly, "Let the wearer, whoever he may be, look to his steps!" and turned to face
Rand. "Seeing there is no name to divulge, there are of course no proofs of faithlessness."
He rose. "It is growing late, gentlemen, and I, for one, am committed to Mrs. Ambler's party.
Who goes towards the Eagle?"

There was a movement throughout the coffee room. It was full dark, home beckoned, and a number
besides Cary were pledged to the evening's entertainment. From every table men were rising,
gathering up their papers, when Rand's voice, harsh, raised, and thick with passion, jarred
the room. "I hold, Mr. Cary, that not even to please his fine imagination is a gentleman justified
in publicly weaving caps of so particular a description!"

Cary turned sharply. "Not even when he weaves it for a man of straw?--your own expression,
Mr. Rand."

"Even men of straw," answered the other thickly, "find sometimes a defender. By God, I'll not
endure it!"

"All this," said Cary scornfully,--"all this for the usual, the familiar, the expected Federalist
criticism of Republican precept and practice! What, specifically, is it, Mr. Rand, that you'll
not endure?"

"I'll endure," replied Rand, in a strained, monotonous, and menacing voice, "no taunt from you."

As he spoke, he threw himself forward. "Have a care, sir!" cried Cary, and flung out his arm.
He had seen, and the men around had seen, the intention of the blow. It was not struck. Amid
the commotion that arose, Rand suddenly, and with an effort so violent and so directed that
it had scarcely been in the scope of any other there, checked himself upon the precipice's
verge, stood rigid, and strove with white lips for self-command. His inmost, his highest man
had no desire to feel or to exhibit ungoverned rage, but there was a legion against him--and
the black and furious dog. The coffee house was in a ferment. "Gentlemen--gentlemen!--What's
the quarrel, Rand?--Ludwell Cary, I'm at your service!--Bills and bows! bills and bows!--or
is it coffee and pistols?" Fairfax Cary had sprung to his brother's side. Adam Gaudylock, annihilating
in some mysterious fashion the distance between the corner table and the group in the light
of the fire, was visible over Rand's shoulder. Mr. Pincornet, chin in air and with his hand
where once a sword had been, tiptoed upon the fringe of the crowd. The clamour went on. "Is
it a challenge?--was a blow struck?--Mr. Cary, command me--Mr. Rand--"

Cary and Rand, standing opposed, three feet of bare floor between them, looked fixedly at each
other. Both were pale, both breathing heavily, but for both the unthinking moment had passed.
Reflection had come and was standing there between them. To Rand it wore more faces than one,
but to Cary it was steadily a form in white with amethysts about the neck. There had been--it
was well, it was best--no blow struck, no lie given. Cary drew a long breath, shook himself
slightly like a swimmer who has breasted a formidable wave, and broke into a laugh. "No affront
and no challenge, gentlemen! That is so, is it not, Mr. Rand?"

If there was an instant's sombre hesitation, it was no more. "Yes, that is so," said Rand.
"After all, men should be more stable. There is no quarrel, gentlemen."

He bowed ceremoniously to Cary, who returned the salute. Each moved from where he had stood,
and the tide at Lynch's came between them. There was some questioning, some excited speech,
some natural disappointment at matters going no further. It was not clearly understood what
offence had been given or what taken, but many felt aggrieved by the check on the threshold
of a likely affair. However, it was, they could concede, the business of the two principals,
each of whom could afford to ignore any seeming reflection upon his unreadiness to pick up
the glove--if a glove had been thrown. As the assemblage broke up and flowed homeward, the
most pertinent comment, perhaps, was that of the down-river planter: "If 'twas just a breeze,
and all over, why didn't they shake hands? Gad! when I was young and we fell out and made up
over the wine, we went roaring home arm over shoulder! Your manners are too cold. A bow is
nothing--one can bow to a villain! Men of honour, when the quarrel's over, should shake hands!"

"Precisely," said his companion, who chanced to be Mr. Wickham. "They are men of honour; they
didn't shake hands. Ergo the quarrel's not over!--Here we are at the Eagle."

CHAPTER XVII

FAIRFAX AND UNITY

"Bah!" exclaimed Major Churchill. "Long ago Hamilton said the last word on the subject. Aaron
Burr's sole political principle is to mount. The Gazette says he has started West--gone, I'll
swear, to light the fuse."

"Then I hope the mine will blow up under him," said Fairfax Cary. "Can you tell me, sir, if
Miss Dandridge is at home?"

The Major looked over the top of his Gazette. "Miss Dandridge is sitting beneath the catalpa
tree." The other made a movement towards the door. "Mr. Page is with her. He is reading aloud--Eloïsa
to Abelard, or some such impassioned stuff. Don't apologize! I have no objection to expletives."

The younger Cary laid down his hat, took a chair with great deliberation, and flecked his boot
with his riding-whip. "The catalpa shall be sacred for me. Eloïsa to Abelard! Is it a long
poem, sir?"

"It is longer than its author was. Sentimental rubbish!"

Major Edward folded the Gazette with his one hand, laid it on the library table, and leaned
back in his leather chair. "It is not my opinion that Unity cares for Mr. Page. She cares for
what many men and an occasional woman have cared for--liberty."

"I would give her liberty."

"She may possibly prefer it," said the Major dryly, "first hand."

The young man laughed ruefully. "So little liberty as she has left me! I am bound hand and
foot to her chariot wheels. There's nothing I wouldn't do for her, short of hearing Page read
aloud."

"You'll win in the end, I think. And I hope you may. Unity Dandridge is wilful, but she is
a fine woman."

"The finest in the world--the most beautiful--the most sparkling--the most loyal--"

"You'll not find her lacking in spirit. She will speak her mind, will Miss Dandridge! The Carys,
fortunately, have a certain fine obstinacy of their own. It is a saving grace."

The other laughed. "I never heard that the Churchills lacked it, sir. Anyhow, I mean to marry
Miss Dandridge. I've told her and the world my intention, and they may count upon my carrying
it out. If she only knew how lonely it is at Greenwood! Breakfast, dinner, and supper--Ludwell
at the head of the table and I at the foot, and a company of ghosts in between--"

"Ludwell may yet marry."

Fairfax Cary shook his head. "No. He'll never marry. If the Carys are obstinate, sir, they
are also constant."

Major Churchill rose, turned to the bookshelves, and drew forth a volume. "Is he not over that?"
he asked harshly.

"No, he is not. He'll never be over it. And they say matches are made in heaven!"

"Bah! They are made on earth, and cracked hearts can be mended like any other cracked ware.
'A little crudded milk, fantastical puff-paste,' with a woman's name--and it has power to turn
the sunshine black! Let him play the man and put her out of mind!"

"He does play the man," answered the other, with spirit. "He neither sulks nor shirks. It remains
that there was but one woman in the world for him, and that she is at Roselands with Lewis Rand."

The Major's book fell with a crash to the floor. He stooped quickly and recovered it before
the younger man could give him service. "I shall run Mustapha on the sixteenth at Staunton
against Carter's York," he said, in a shaking voice. "Have you seen that Barbary mare Dick
has gotten over from England?"

"No," answered the young man. "I'll take a look at the stables before I go. What is your book,
sir?"

"It is"--said the Major. "I'm damned if I know what it is!" and he looked at the volume in
his hand. "Paul and Virginia--faugh!" He threw the book down and stalked to the window. Fairfax
Cary sat in silence, one booted knee over the other, an arm upon the back of his chair, and
the riding-whip depending from his hand. The Major turned. "They have laid down Pope, and Mr.
Page is making his adieux! Humph! I can remember a day when the poem was considered vastly
moving. I would advise you to strike while the iron is hot."

"Sometimes I think it will take an earthquake to move her toward me," said the other. "I'll
give Page three minutes in which to clear out, and then I'll try again. It would amuse you,
sir, to know how many times I have tried. If to have an object in life is praiseworthy, I am
much to be lauded!"

"You have always evinced a fine determination," admitted the Major. "Well, life must have an
object, fair or foul. With it, cark and care; without it, ditchwater! This way disappointment;
that, fungi on a log. Vanity in either direction, but a man of honour must prefer the rack
to the stocks."

Fairfax Cary looked at his watch. "Page's time is up. I'll go pursue my object, sir."

The pursuit took him over the greensward to the bench built around the great catalpa. The heat
of the day was broken and the evening shadows lay upon the grass. Mr. Page was gone. Unity
sat beneath the catalpa, elbow on knee and chin in hand, studying a dandelion at her feet.
The poetical works of Mr. Alexander Pope lay at a distance, face down. The sky between the
broad catalpa leaves was very blue, and a long ray of sunshine sifted through to gild the tendrils
of Miss Dandridge's hair and to slide in brightness down her flowery gown. She glanced at the
young man striding towards her from the house, then again admired the dandelion.

Fairfax Cary stooped, picked up Pope, and regarded the open pages with disfavour. "And at home
he probably reads only The Complete Farrier--on Sundays maybe the Gentleman's Magazine or The
Book of Dreams!"

"Who?" asked Unity.

"My rival. If he read Greek, he would yet be my rival and an ignorant fellow."

"He does read Greek," said Miss Dandridge severely, "and 'ignorant fellow' is the last thing
that could be applied to him. Did you ride over from Greenwood to be scornful?"

"I rode over to be as meek as Moses and as patient as Job--"

"They were never my favourites in Scripture."

"Nor mine." He closed the book, swung his arm, and Pope crashed into a lilac bush. "There,"
he said, "goes meekness, patience, and the eighteenth century. This is the nineteenth. Time
is no endless draught, no bottomless cup. Waste of life is the cankered rose. You know that
you treat me badly."

"Do I?--I did not mean to."

"You do. Now you've got to say to me, 'I love you and I'll marry you,' or 'I love you not and
I'm going to marry some one else.' If it's the first, I'll be the happiest man on earth; if
the second, I'll go far away and try to forget."

"Won't you sit down?"

"You have kept me standing in spirit these three years. Standing!--kneeling! Now, will you
or won't you?"

"I do not care in the least for Mr. Page. He is merely an agreeable acquaintance."

"And Mr. Dabney?"

"The same. He entertains me--"

"Mr. Lee--Mr. Minor--Ned Hunter--"

"What applies to one applies to all."

"I am glad to hear it. All merely agreeable acquaintances. And Mr. Fairfax Cary? He is, perhaps,
in the same category?"

"Perhaps. Oh, what a beautiful butterfly!--there, on that trumpet flower! I think it is a Tawny
Emperor."

"I see," said the young man. "Excuse me a moment while I frighten him away." He gravely shook
the trumpet vine, and the light splendour spread its wings and sailed to a securer realm. "Now
that the Emperor is gone perhaps you will pay attention. Am I merely an agreeable acquaintance?"

"Oh--agreeable!" murmured Miss Dandridge.

"I am not trying to be agreeable. I am looking for the truth. Am I, then, merely an acquaintance?"

Unity sighed. "Why not say 'friend'?"

"'Friend' is good as far as it goes. It does not go far enough."

"Yes, it does," said Miss Dandridge. "It goes further than all your less sober travellers.

     "Love me little, love me long.

"You want such violent things!"

"I want you. Is it, then, only a poor, pale friendship?"

"Why call it poor and pale? Friendship can be rosy-cheeked as well as--as other things. Look
how the grass is burned--and all the locusts are singing of the heat!"

"It is beneath you to trifle so. If this is all, it is poor and pale, and the sooner it dies,
the better! Unity, I'm waiting for your coup de grâce."

"I'm tired," said Unity. "You hurt me, and I'm tired."

"I never heard you say that before. Look at me! the tears are in your eyes."

"Everybody cries over Eloïsa to Abelard.

     "O death all-eloquent! you only prove
     What dust we dote on, when't is man we love!

"Where are you going?"

"Home first, then--I don't know where. Good-bye."

"Don't go."

"I'm afraid the book in the lilac bush is spoiled. If you'll allow me, I'll send you another copy."

"Please don't go."

"The tears are on your cheeks. It is a moving poem.

     "Oh, may we never love as those have loved!

"This is the third and last good-bye. Good-bye."

The younger Cary turned and resolutely walked away. Miss Dandridge rose and followed him. He
did not turn his head, and the thick turf could not echo her light footfall. He walked firmly,
with the port of a man who hears a distant drum beat to action. Miss Dandridge admired the
attitude through her tears. He walked rapidly and the sweep of greensward between them widened.
It was no great distance to the driveway and the white pillars of the house. Uncle Dick and
Uncle Edward, Deb, the servants, any one, might be looking out of the windows. For one moment
Unity stopped short as Atalanta when she saw the golden apple, then she began to run. She touched
her goal within ten feet of the house, and he stood still and looked at the hand upon his arm.
"Oh!" she panted. "Don't go! I--I--I--"

"I--?"

"I love you. Oh!"

If any window saw, it was discreet and never told, remembering perhaps a youth of its own.
The embrace was not prolonged beyond a minute. Unity, red and beautiful, released herself,
looked about her like a startled dryad, and made again for the catalpa. Fairfax Cary followed,
and they took that portion of the circular bench which had between it and the house the giant
bole of the tree. Before them dipped the shady hollow, filled with the rustling of leaves,
cool and retired as its parent forest.

"Oh, yes, yes; it's true, gospel true!" cried Unity. "But I'll not be married for a long, long
year!"

"A year! You're going to be cruel again."

"No, no, I'm not cruel! I never was. 'Twas all your imagination. When I marry, I'll be married
hard and fast, hand and foot, wind and rain, sleet and snow, June and December, forever and
a day, world without end, amen! holidays and all! I may live forever, and I'll be married all
that time. I want just one little year to say good-bye to Unity Dandridge in."

"We'll take her to Greenwood with us."

"No, no. We'll bury her in the flower garden the day before. Just one year--please!"

"Oh, Unity, when you say 'please'!"

"This is August. I'll marry you twelve little months from now--please!"

"A thousand things may happen--"

"They won't--they won't. Don't you love Unity Dandridge? Then let her live a little longer!"

"Kiss me--"

Unity did as she was bid. The sunlight left the hollow, but stayed bright upon the hills beyond.
It was August, but in a treetop somewhere a solitary bird was singing. Nearer the earth the
crickets and cicadas began their evening concert, a shrill drumming in the warm, still air.
There was a scent of dry grass, a feeling of summer at its full. Dewy freshness, tender green,
mist of bloom, and a thousand songs were far away, and yet upon the bench beneath the catalpa
there was spring.

"The sun is setting," said Unity at last. "Let us go speak to Uncle Dick."

"He'll be glad, I think. May I stay to supper? I want to hear Unity Dandridge sing afterwards."

"Yes, Uncle Dick will be glad--he and Uncle Edward will be very glad. I don't believe that
Unity Dandridge will want to sing to-night. She'll be thinking of that grave in the flower garden."

"No! She shall think of the sunrise at Greenwood--sunrise and splendid roses and the million
harps of heaven playing!"

"Oh!" cried Unity, "the sunrise at Greenwood should have been for your brother!"

"Yes, for him and your cousin. Blind fate! He is worth a thousand of me, and he sits lonely
there in his house--and I am here!"

"There's no pure joy."

"When I tell him to-night, he will feel but pure joy for me--not one thought of self, of the
sunrise he might have watched at Greenwood! Oh, Justice and her balances! There goes the last
rim of the sun."

"I'll sing to you what you will--and you may stay as long as you like--and I'll love you all
my life. Oh! Now let's go find Uncle Dick."

Uncle Dick was easily found, being in fact upon the porch in his especial chair, with the dogs
around him, and in his hand a silver goblet of mint and apple brandy. "Hey! What, what!" he
cried, "has the jade said Yes at last? Where's Edward? Edward, Edward! Kiss me, you minx! Fair,
I wish that my dear friend, your father, were alive. Well, well, patience does it, and the
Lord knows, Unity, he's been patient! Oh, you black-eyed piece, you need a bit and bridle!
Here's Edward! Edward, the shrew's tamed at last! Such a wedding as Fontenoy will have!"

Four hours later, when supper was over, and Aunt Nancy in the "chamber" had been visited by
the affianced pair, and all matters had been discussed, and Unity at the harpsichord had sung
without protest a number of very sentimental songs, and Deb had gone unwillingly to bed, and
first one uncle and then the other had thoughtfully faded from the drawing-room, and good-night,
when it came to be said in the moonlit porch, took ten minutes to say, and the boy who brought
around the visitor's horse had caught with a grin and a "Thank'e, sah!" the whirling silver
dollar, and Major Edward's voice had sounded from the hail door behind Unity, "Good-night,
Fair; bring Ludwell with you to-morrow night," and Unity had echoed softly, "Yes, bring Ludwell,"
and the last wave of the hand had been given, Fairfax Cary cantered down the driveway and through
the lower gates. Out upon the red highway he put his horse to the gallop, and rode with his
bared head high to the wind and the stars of night.

At Greenwood there was but one light burning. He saw it half a mile from the house, lost it,
then caught it again, crowning like a star the low hilltop. Bending from the saddle, he opened
the gate, passed through, and rode on beneath the oaks to the house door. The light shone from
the library. When a negro had taken his horse, the younger Cary entered to find his brother
sitting before a mass of books and papers, wine on the table, and a favourite dog asleep upon
the hearth. "You are late," said the elder, looking up with a smile. "Fontenoy, of course?"

"Fontenoy, of course. Ludwell, I've won!"

The elder brother pushed back his chair, rose, and, going to the younger, put both hands upon
his shoulders. "Fair. I'm glad! I told you that you would. She's the loveliest black-eyed lady--and
as for you, you deserve your fortune! Monsieur mon frère, I make you my congratulations!"

"What a blaze of light you've got in here! All the way home my horse's hoofs were saying, Unity
Cary--Unity Cary."

Ludwell laughed. "You're drunk with joy. The room is not brightly lit. Sit down and tell me
all about it."

"'Twas underneath the catalpa tree. We quarrelled--"

"As usual."

"Page had been there, reading aloud,--reading Eloïsa to Abelard."

"Oh!"

"We quarrelled. I said good-bye forever, and walked away. She came after me over the grass.
Ludwell, to hold the woman that you love in your arms, close, close--"

"I can guess 'twas bliss. And then?"

"Heaven still--only quieter. We went back to the bench under the catalpa."

"Happy tree! And I never thought it a poetic growth--the flowers are so sticky! Now Unity shall
plant one at Greenwood."

"'Unity'! Isn't it sweet to say just 'Unity'?"

The other laughed again. "I think you are a very satisfactory lover! And when's the marriage,
Fair?"

"Not for a whole year--she won't marry me for a whole year to come!"

"Why, that's too long," said the elder kindly. "What reason?"

"Time to say farewell. Once she's married, she will never see Unity Dandridge again!"

Both laughed, but there was much tenderness in their laughter. "Oh, she's individual!" said
Ludwell. "Even when you add the Cary, she'll be Unity Dandridge still. A year! Perhaps she
may relent."

"I've given my word not to ask her."

"Ah!--well, a year's not so long, Fair. She's a lovely witch--she'll charm the hours away.
This time next year how gay we'll make the old house!"

The younger paced the room. "I can't go to bed. Michaelmas--Christmas--St. Valentine's--Easter--the
Fourth--then August again. Twelve months!"

"You'll ride to Fontenoy in the morning."

"That's true--and you'll ride with me. The last thing that she said was that I was to bring
you. Ludwell, I want to say that not even Unity, though I love her so much, could ever make
me love you an iota the less. You know that, don't you?"

"Yes, I know, Fair," said the other from the great chair. "We are friends as well as brothers.
I'm as glad for your happiness as if it were my own, and I'll ride with you to Fontenoy to
kiss my new sister. You've both chosen wisely, and it's a great day for Greenwood! Stop that
striding here and there like an ecstatic lion! Sit down and tell me all about it again. The
wine's good, and I'll light more candles. There!"

"You're the best fellow in the world, Ludwell," said the younger gratefully. "She had on a
gown with little flowers all over a yellowy ground, and there was a curl that came down on
her white neck--and when I had gone away forever and then felt her hand upon my arm, it was
like a sword-stroke opening Paradise. It isn't really late, is it? I could talk till dawn!"

CHAPTER XVIII

THE GREEN DOOR

The coach of Mrs. Jane Selden entered Charlottesville at nine in the morning, and did not turn
homeward again until the afternoon stood at four. The intermediate hours were diligently used
by the small and withered lady in plum-coloured silk and straw bonnet, scarf of striped, apple-green
gauze, and turkey-feather fan. She came to town but once in three months, and made of each
visit a field day. Every store was called at, for buying must be done for herself and her plantation
to last until Christmas-tide. Lutestring, calico, chintz and prunella, linsey and osnaburg;
gilt-edged paper, sticks of wax, and fine black ink; drugs of sorts, bohea, spice, and china
were bought and bestowed in brown paper parcels in corners of a vehicle ample as Cinderella's
pumpkin coach, while Jamaica sugar and Java coffee, old rum, molasses, salt and vinegar, hardware,
kitchen things, needs of the quarter, and all heavy matters were left to be called for by her
wagon next day. Shopping over, she took dinner with an ancient friend, and afterwards called
upon the doctor and the minister. The post-office came next in order, and then the blacksmith,
for one of her four sleepy coach horses had cast a shoe. The fault remedied, she looked at
her watch. "Half-past three. Stop at the green door, Gabriel."

Coach and four made a wide turn, swung drowsily down the main street, and drew up before a
one-story brick building with a green door and a black lettered sign above, "Lewis Rand, Attorney-at-Law."

Mrs. Selden, putting her head out of the window, directed a small negro, lounging near, to
raise the knocker below the sign; but before she could be obeyed, the door opened and Rand
himself came quickly down the steps. "Come, come!" he said; "I knew it was your day in town,
and I was wondering if you were going by without a word."

"Don't I always stop? A habit is a habit. We are all miserable sinners, and the world can't
get on without lawyers. I want to ask you how I'm to keep old Tom Carfax off my land. There
is no one with you?"

"No one. Mocket has ridden over to North Garden, and I've just dismissed a deputation from
Milton." As he spoke, he opened the coach door and assisted his old friend to alight.

Together they went into the office, which was a cool little place, with a climbing rose at
the windows, a bare floor, and a dim fragrance of law-books. The shade was grateful after the
August heat and glare. Mrs. Selden, seated in a capacious wooden chair, wielded her turkey
fan and looked about her at the crowded book-shelves, the mass of papers held down on desk
and deal table by pieces of iron ore, the land maps on the wall, the corner ledger and high
stool, the cupboard whose opened door disclosed bottles and glasses, and the blush roses just
without the two small windows. "I like the law," she remarked. "There's a deal of villainy
in it, no doubt, but that's a complaint to which all ways of making a living are liable. Even
a shoemaker may be a villain. How does it feel to be a great lawyer, Lewis?"

He smiled. "Am I a great one?"

"You should know best, but it's what men call you. What was your deputation from Milton? About
the governorship?"

"Yes."

"What did you say?"

"I thanked them for the honour they did me, and told them that I had declined the nomination."

"You have declined it! Why?"

He smiled again. "You used to preach contentment when I was a boy and you heard me rage out
against my father. Well--shall I not rest content with being a great lawyer?"

His old neighbour regarded him keenly above her turkey-feather fan. "Lewis Rand, Lewis Rand,"
she said at last, "I wish I knew your end."

He laughed. "Do you mean my aim in life, or my last hour?"

"The one," said his visitor sharply, "will be according to the other. We all wander through
a wood into some curious place at last. You're the kind of person one thinks of as coming into
a stranger place than common. Have you heard the news about Unity Dandridge and Fairfax Cary?"

"Yes. She was at Roselands yesterday."

"It's good news. Unity Dandridge needs a master, and there's been no woman at Greenwood this
weary while. Ludwell Cary will never marry."

"I see nothing to prevent his marrying."

Mrs. Selden suspended the waving of her fan. "He won't. Don't dislike him so, Lewis. It shows
in your forehead."

"Is it so plain as that?" asked Rand. "Well, I do dislike him."

"Enmities are born with us, I suppose," said his visitor thoughtfully. "I remember a man whom,
without reason, I hated. Had I been a man, I would have made it my study to quarrel with him--to
force him into a duel--to make way with him secretly if need be! I wouldn't have stopped at
murder. And it was all a mistake, as I found when he was dead and I didn't have to walk the
same earth with him any more. It's a curious world, is the heart of man. And so you won't be
Governor of Virginia?"

"Not now--some later day, perhaps. You see it takes all my time to be a great lawyer!"

"You don't deceive me," said Mrs. Selden, with great dryness. "But good or bad, your reason's
your own, and I'll not ask you to satisfy an old woman's curiosity. In my day it was something
to be Governor of Virginia." She waved her fan more vigorously than before, and the wind from
it blew a paper from the table beside her. She was birdlike in her movements, and before Rand
could stoop, she had caught the sheet. "Rows and rows of figures!" she exclaimed. "Is it a
sum you're doing?"

He nodded, taking it from her. "Yes; a giant of a sum," he answered easily, and put the paper
in his pocket. "Now what is old Carfax doing on your land?"

The consultation over, Mrs. Selden left the office and was handed by Rand into the pumpkin
coach. When he had closed the door, he yet stood beside the lowered glass, his arm, sleeved
in fine green cloth, laid along its rim, his strong face, clear cut and dark, smiling in upon
his old friend. In his mind was the long and dreary stretch of his boyhood when she and Adam
Gaudylock were the only beings towards whom he had a friendly thought. He was one of those
men whose minds still hold communion with all the selves that they have left behind. Each in
its day had been a throbbing, vital thing, and though at times he found the past obtrusive
and wished to throw it off, he could never utterly do so. There was for him no Lethe. But if
he tasted the disadvantages of so compound a self, to others the array enriched the man, making
him vibrant of all that had been as well as all that was. It put them, too, to speculation
as to how great an army he would gather ere the end, and as to the nature of the last recruit.
The visitor from the Three-Notched Road looked at him now with her keen old eyes and laid her
mittened hand upon his arm. "Be a good man, Lewis Rand! Be a great one if you will, but be
good. That comes first."

Rand touched her withered hand with his lips. "It is women who are good. And you'll not come
to town again until nearly Christmas! I'll ride over before then, and I'll settle Carfax for
you. You are going home now?"

"Vinie Mocket is cutting watermelon rind for me. I'll stop there first and then I'll go home!
Give my love to Jacqueline. I heard at the Swan that Mr. Jefferson is at Monticello. Is that true?"

"Yes, it is true."

"Humph!" said Mrs. Selden. "Then you'll be at Monticello all hours. I wish you'd ask him for
a seedling of that new peach tree."

"I shall not be there all hours," said Rand, "but I'll manage to get the seedling for you.
Good-bye, good-bye!"

The coach and four lumbered on down the dusty Main Street. Mrs. Selden, sitting opposite her
brown paper bundles, waved her fan and looked out on the parching trees and the straggling,
vine-embowered houses. For half an hour there had been a thought at the back of her head, and
now it suddenly opened wings. Those strangely arranged lines of figures on that paper which
had fluttered to the floor, they formed no sum that Lewis Rand was working! The paper that
they covered was not a stray leaf; it had been folded like a letter. There was, she remembered,
a piece of wax upon it. It was a day when men of mark often wrote to each other in cipher--there
was nothing strange in Lewis Rand so corresponding with whom he chose. Most probably it was
a letter from the President--though that could hardly be, seeing that the President was at
Monticello! Mrs. Selden looked out of the window towards that low, green mountain which was
now rising before her, and frowningly tried to remember some gossamer of speech which had been
blown to her upon the Three-Notched Road. A quarrel between Rand and the President?--pshaw!
it could hardly have been that! She had a sudden memory of Rand's face ere he grew to manhood,
of the ardent eyes and the involuntary gesture of reverence which he used when he spoke of
Mr. Jefferson. He could not even speak of him without a certain trembling of the voice. Any
one could see the change in him since then, but it was hardly to be believed that the old feeling
did not abide at the bottom of the well! Mrs. Selden was annoyed. The letter might have been
from Mr. Madison, or Mr. Monroe, or Albert Gallatin, or John Randolph,--though John Randolph,
too, had quarrelled with the President,--or Spencer Roane, or almost any great Democrat-Republican.
It was no business of hers whom it was from. A colour crept into her withered cheek, and she
tapped her black silk shoe upon the floor of the coach. "Yes; a giant of a sum," Lewis had
said with great easiness, and then had put the paper out of sight. Why had he not been frank?
He might have said to an old friend, "That's a cipher,--you see men will be riddlers still!"
and then have laid away the letter as securely as he pleased! Mrs. Selden hated deceit in anything,
great or small, and hated to find flaws in folk of whom she was fond. It was a trifle truly,
but Lewis Rand had meant to give her a false impression, and that when he knew as well as she
how she detested falsity! As for his reasons for concealment,--let him keep his reasons! She
angrily told herself that Jane Selden had no desire to pry into a politician's secrets. But
he should have said that the letter was a letter! With which conclusion, the coach having drawn
up before Vinie Mocket's door, Mrs. Selden dismissed the matter from her mind, and, descending,
was met by Vinie herself at the gate.

"I've got the sweetmeats all cut, Mrs. Selden! Grapes and baskets, and hearts with arrows through
them, and vases of roses. I never did any prettier. Won't you come in, ma'am? There's water
just drawn from the well."

"Then I'll have a glass, and I'll just look at the sweetmeats. It is late and I must be going
home. Vinie, why don't you have your gate mended?"

"It always was broken," said Vinie. "I'm always meaning to have it mended. Will you sit on
the porch, ma'am? It's cooler than inside."

The short path was lined with zinnias and with prince's feather and the porch covered with
a shady grapevine. Vinie brought a pitcher beaded with cool well water, and then a salver spread
with fanciful shapes cut from the delicate green rind of melon and ready for preserving. Mrs.
Selden drank the well water and approved Vinie's skill; then, "Your brother's gone to North
Garden," she said abruptly. "Mr. Rand's affairs must keep him busy."

"Yeth, ma'am. Tom comes and goes," said Vinie wistfully. "I wish he'd be Governor of Virginia."

"Who? Tom?"

The girl laughed. "La, no, ma'am! Mr. Rand." The tone conveyed, pleasantly enough, both the
grotesque impossibility of Mr. Tom Mocket aspiring to such a post, and the eminent suitability
of its lying in the fortunes of Lewis Rand. Vinie, shy and pink and faintly pretty in her shell
calico, leaned against the wooden railing beneath the grapevine, and appealed to her visitor:
"I'm always after Tom to make him say he'll run. Tom can do a great deal with him--he always
could. I reckon all his friends want him to take the nomination. But Tom says he has a bigger
thing in mind--"

"Who? Tom?"

"No, ma'am. Mr. Rand. I forgot! Tom said I wasn't to tell that to any one." Vinie looked distressed.
"Won't you have another glass of water, ma'am? The drouth this year is something awful--all
the corn burned up and the tobacco failing. Tom will be back soon from North Garden. Yeth,
ma'am, he works right hard for Mr. Rand. The last time he was here he said that whether he
ended in a palace or a dungeon, he'd remember Tom somewhere towards the last. Yeth, ma'am,
it was a funny thing to say, but he was always mighty fond of Tom."

"Does he come here often?"

"Right often,--when there's work to be done at night, or when he wants to meet some one at
a quieter place than the office. He's always known he could use this house as he pleased,"
Vinie ended simply. "Tom and I would go barefoot over fire for Mr. Rand."

"Well, my dear, I hope he won't ask you to," said her visitor, with dryness. She rose. "I've
a long drive before me, so I'll not sit longer. Who's that--I left my glasses in the coach--who's
that speaking to Gabriel?"

"It's Mr. Gaudylock."

"Gaudylock! He's not been in Albemarle for a year! When did he come back?"

"Just the other day, ma'am." A smile crept over Vinie's face. "He brought me a comb like the
Spanish women wear. He's a mighty kind man--Mr. Gaudylock."

The hunter and Mrs. Selden met at the broken gate. "I am glad to see you back, Adam," she said.
"You're a rolling stone, but all the same we're fond of you in Albemarle."

"I'm surely fond of Albemarle, ma'am," answered Adam.

"When I've rolled long and far enough and the moss is ready to gather on me, I reckon I'll
roll back to a hillside in the old county. I'm sorry to see the drouth so bad. We've had a
power of rain over the mountains."

"Not long since, I had a letter from a kinsman of mine in Louisiana, and he spoke of you. He
said that up and down the rivers you were known, that the villages made it a holiday when you
came to one, and that in the forest your name was like Robin Hood's."

"Robin Hood? Who's he?" demanded Adam; then, "Oh, you mean the man in the poetry book. I reckon
he never saw the Mississippi in flood, and his forest would have laid on the palm of your hand.
Yes, I'm known out there." He gave his mellow laugh. "A letter of introduction from Adam Gaudylock
is a pretty good letter, whether it's to the captain of an ark, or a Creek sachem, or a Natchitoches
settler, or a soldier at Fort Stoddert. Let me help you in, ma'am."

He handed her to her seat with the sure lightness and the woodsman's grace which was part of
his charm, then gave her order to Gabriel. The coach turned and went back through the Main
Street, and so on, in the yellow afternoon, to the Three-Notched Road. As she passed again
the green door, Mrs. Selden looked out, but the door was fast and the shutters closed behind
the blush roses. "He must have gone home early," she said to herself, and all the way along
the Three-Notched Road she thought of Lewis Rand and his career.

Rand had not gone home, but was walking down the street towards the Eagle and the post-office.
Presently the stage would be in, and he carried a letter the posting of which he did not care
to entrust to another. He walked lightly and firmly, in the glow before sunset, and as he approached
the post-office steps he met, full face, coming from the other end of the town, Colonel Richard
and Major Edward Churchill and Fairfax Cary. They were afoot, having left their horses at the
Swan while they waited for the incoming stage. The post-office had a high white porch, and
on this were gathered a number of planters and townsfolk, while others lounged below on the
trodden grass beneath three warped mulberries. All these, suspending conversation, watched
the encounter.

Rand lifted his hat, and Fairfax Cary answered the salute with cold punctilio, but the two
Churchills, the one with a red, the other with a stony countenance, ignored their nephew-in-law.
The four reached together the post-office steps, a somewhat long and wide flight, but not broad
enough to accommodate a blood feud. Rand made no attempt at speech, conciliatory or otherwise,
but with a slight gesture of courtesy stood aside for the two elder men to pass and precede
him. The smile upon his lip was half bitter, half philosophic, and as they passed, he regarded
them aslant but freely. The burly, heated figure of the Colonel was trembling with anger, while
Major Edward, striving for indifference, achieved only a wonderful, grey hauteur. They had
been talking of the drouth, and they talked on while they went by Rand, but their voices sounded
hollow like drums in a desert. They took as little outward notice of the living man whose fate
entwined with theirs as if he had been a bleached bone upon the desert sands. They went on
and, upon the porch above, mingled with a group of friends and neighbours.

Rand put himself in motion, and he and Fairfax Cary mounted step for step. The elder man looked
aside at his companion of the moment, slender and vigorous, boyishly handsome in his dark riding-dress.
He harboured no enmity towards the younger Cary, and for Unity he had only admiration and affection.
His mind was full of recesses, and in one of them there hovered on bright wings a desire for
the esteem of these two. In his day-dreams he steadily conferred upon them benefits, and in
day-dreams he saw their feeling for him turn from prejudice to respect and fondness. Now, after
a moment's hesitation, he spoke. "I have no quarrel, Mr. Cary, with a happiness that all the
county is glad of. Miss Dandridge and my wife are the fondest friends. May I offer you my congratulations?"

He had ceased to move forward, and the other paused with him. The younger Cary was thinking,
"Now if I were Ludwell, I'd accept this with simplicity, since, damn him, in this the man's
sincere." He looked at the toe of his boot, swallowed hard, and then faced Rand with a sudden,
transfiguring brightness of mien. "I thank you, Mr. Rand. Miss Dandridge is an angel, and I'm
the happiest of men. Will you tell Mrs. Rand so, with my best regards?" He hesitated a moment,
then went on: "No sign of rain! This weather is calamitous! I hope that Roselands has not suffered
as Greenwood has done?"

"But it has," said Rand, with a smile. "The corn is all burned, and the entire state will make
but little tobacco this year. Miss Dandridge is better than an angel; she's a very noble woman--I
wish you both long life and happiness!"

They said no more, but mounted the remaining steps to the level above. Fairfax Cary joined
the two Churchills and their friends, while Rand, after a just perceptible hesitation, entered
the small room where the postmaster was filling, with great leisureliness, the leather mail-bag.
Besides himself there was no other there; even the window gave not upon the porch, but on a
quiet, tangled garden. He took the letter from his breast pocket and stood looking at it. The
postmaster, after the first word of greeting, went on with his work, whistling softly as he
handled the stiffly folded, wax-splashed missives of the time. The wind was in the west, and
the fitful air came in from the withered garden and breathed upon Rand's forehead. He stood
for perhaps five minutes looking at the letter, then with a curious and characteristic gesture
of decision he walked to the high counter and with his own hand dropped it into the mail-bag,
then waited to see it covered by the drift from the postmaster's fingers. "Don't the world
move, sir?" said the latter worthy. "It hasn't been so long since there wasn't any mail for
the West anyhow, and now look at this bag! Kentucky, and this new Tennessee, and Mississippi,
and Louisiana, and the Lord knows what besides! Letters coming thick and fast to Mr. Jefferson,
and letters going out from every one who has a dollar or an acre or a son or brother in those
God-forsaken parts where Adam Gaudylock says they don't speak English and you walk uphill to
the river! I like things snug, Mr. Rand, and this country's too big and this mail's too heavy.
You have correspondents out there yourself, sir."

"Yes," answered Rand, with indifference. "As you say, Mr. Smock, all the world writes letters
nowadays. Certainly it is natural that from all over the West men should write to Mr. Jefferson."

"Natural or not, they do it," quoth Mr. Smock doggedly. "I thought I heard the stage horn?"

Rand looked at his watch. "Not yet. It lacks some minutes of its time," he said, and, leaning
on the counter, waited until he saw the mail-bag filled and securely fastened. Lounging there,
he took occasion to ask after the health of Mr. Smock's wife, and to commiserate the burnt
garden without the window. If the expression of interest was calculated, the interest itself
was genuine enough. A shrewd observer might have said that in dealing with the voters of his
county Rand exhibited a fine fusion of the subtle politician with the well-wishing neighbour.
The facts that he was quite simply and sincerely sorry for the postmaster's ailing wife, and
that he had the yeoman's love for fresh and springing green instead of withered leaf and stalk,
in no wise militated against that other fact that it was his cue to conciliate, as far as might
be, the minds of men. He almost never neglected his cue; when he did so, it was because uncontrollable
passion had intervened. Now the postmaster, too, shook his head over the ruined garden, entered
with particularity into the doctor's last report, and by the time that Rand, with a nod of
farewell, left the room, had voted him into the Governor's chair, or any other seat of honour
to which he might aspire. "Brains, brains!" thought Mr. Smock. "And a plain man despite his
fine marriage! If there were more like him, the country would be safer than it is to-day. There
is the horn!"

The stage with its four horses and flapping leather hanging, its heated, red-coated driver
and guard, and its dusty passengers swung into town with great cracking of a whip and blowing
of a horn, drew up at the post-office just long enough to deliver a plethoric mail-bag, and
then rolled on in a pillar of dust to the Eagle. The crowd about the post-office increased,
men gathering on the steps as well as upon the porch above and on the parched turf beneath
the mulberries. There was a principle of division. The Federalists, who were in the minority,
held one end of the porch; the more prominent Republicans the other, while the steps were free
to both, and the space below was given over to a rabble almost entirely Republican. Rand, with
several associates, lawyers or planters, stood near the head of the steps;--all waited for
the sorting and distribution of the mail. The sun was low over the Ragged Mountains, and after
the breathless heat of the day, a wind had arisen that refreshed like wine.

Rand, his back to the light, and paying grave attention to a colleague's low-voiced exposition
of a point in law, did not at first observe a movement of the throng, coupled with the utterance
of a well-known name, but presently, as though an unseen hand had tapped him on the shoulder,
he turned abruptly, and looked with all the rest. Mr. Jefferson was coming up the street, riding
slowly on a big, black horse and followed by a negro groom. The tall, spare form sat very upright,
the reins loosely held in the sinewy hand. Above the lawn neckcloth the face, sanguine in complexion
and with deep-set eyes, looking smilingly from side to side of the village street. He came
on to the post-office amid a buzz of voices, and the more prominent men of his party started
down the steps to greet him. The few Federalists stiffly held their places, but they, too,
as he rode up, lifted their hats to their ancient neighbour and the country's Chief Magistrate.
A dozen hands were ready to help him dismount, but he shook his head with a smile. "Thank you,
gentlemen, but I will keep my seat. I have but ridden down to get my mail.--Mr. Coles, if you
will be so good!--It is a pity, is it not, to see this drouth? There has been nothing like
it these fifty years.--Mr. Holliday, I have news of Meriwether Lewis. He has seen the Pacific.

"Mr. Massie, I want some apples from Spring Valley for my guest, the Abbé Correa.--Mr. Cocke,
my Merinos are prospering despite the burned pastures."

Mr. Coles came down the steps with a great handful of letters and newspapers. The President
took them from him, and, without running them over, deposited all together in a small cotton
bag which hung from his saddle-bow. This done, he raised his head and let his glance travel
from one end to the other of the porch above him. Of the men standing there many were his bitter
political enemies, but also they were his old neighbours, lovers, like himself, of Albemarle
and Virginia, and once, in the old days when all were English, as in the later time when all
were patriots, his friends and comrades. He bowed to them, and they returned his salute, not
genially, but with the respect due to his fame and office. His eye travelled on. "Mr. Rand,
may I have a word with you?"

Rand left the pillar against which he had leaned and came down the steps to the waiting horseman.
He moved neither fast nor slow, but yet with proper alacrity, and his dark face was imperturbable.
The fact of some disagreement, some misunderstanding between Mr. Jefferson and the man who
had entered the public arena as his protégé, had been for some time in the air of Albemarle.
What it was, and whether great or small, Albemarle was not prepared to say. There was a chill
in the air, it thought, but the cloud might well prove the merest passing mist, if, indeed,
Rumour was not entirely mistaken, and the coolness a misapprehension. The President's voice
had been quiet and friendly, and Rand himself moved with a most care-free aspect. He was of
those who draw observation, and all eyes followed him down the steps. He crossed the yard or
two of turf to the black horse, and stood beside the rider. "You wished me, sir?"

"I wish to know if you will be so good as to come to Monticello to-night? After nine the house
will be quiet."

"Certainly I will come, sir."

"I will look for you then." He bowed slightly and gathered up his reins. Rand stood back, and
with a "Good-afternoon to you all, gentlemen," the President wheeled his horse and rode down
the street towards his mountain home. The crowd about the post-office received its mail and
melted away to town house and country house, to supper at both, and to a review, cheerful or
acrimonious, of the events of the day, including the fact that, as far as appearances went,
Lewis Rand was yet the President's staff and confidant. The Churchills and Fairfax Cary rode
away together. In passing, the latter just bent his head to Rand, but Colonel Dick and Major
Edward sat like adamant. Rand took the letters doled out to him by Mr. Smock, glanced at the
superscriptions, and put them in his pocket, then walked to the Eagle and spoke to the hostler
there, and finally, as the big red ball of the sun dipped behind the mountains, betook himself
to Tom Mocket's small house on the edge of town.

He found Vinie on the porch. "Is Adam here?" he asked. She nodded. "That's well," he said.
"I want a talk with him--a long talk. And, Vinie, can you give me a bit of supper? I won't
go home until late to-night;--I have sent my wife word. Tell Adam, will you? that I am here,
and let us have the porch to ourselves."

CHAPTER XIX

MONTICELLO AGAIN

The night was hot and dark when Rand, riding Selim, left the town and took the Monticello road.
He forded the creek, and the horse, scrambling up the farther side, struck fire from the loose
stones. Farther on, the way grew steep, and the heavy shadow of the overhanging trees made
yet more oppressive the breathless night. The stars could hardly be seen between the branches,
but from the ground to the leafy roof the fireflies sparkled restlessly. Rand thought, as he
rode, of the future and the present, but not of the past. It was so old and familiar, this
road, that he might well feel the eyes of the past fixed upon him from every bush and tree;
but if he felt the gaze, he set his will and would not return it. For some time he climbed
through the thick darkness, shot with those small and wandering fires, but at last he came
upon the higher levels and saw below him the wide and dark plain. In the east there was heat
lightning. Here on the mountain-top the air blew, and a man was free from the dust of the valley.
He drew a long breath, checked Selim for a moment, and, sitting there, looked out over the
vast expanse; but the eyes of the past grew troublesome, and he hurried on. It was striking
nine when a negro opened the house gate for him and, following him to the portico, took the
horse from which he dismounted. Light streamed from the open door, and from the library windows.
Except for a glimmer in the Abbé Correa's room, the rest of the house was in darkness. If Mrs.
Randolph and her daughters were there, they had retired. He heard no voices. In the hot and
sulphurous night the pillared, silent house with its open portal provoked a sensation of strangeness.
Rand crossed the portico and paused at the door. Time had been when he would have made no pause,
but, familiar to the house and assured of his welcome, would have passed through the wide hall
to the library and his waiting friend and mentor. Now he laid his hand upon the knocker, but
before it could sound, a door halfway down the hall opened, and there appeared the tall figure
of the President. He stood for a moment, framed in the doorway, gazing at his visitor, and
there was in his regard a curious thoughtfulness, an old regret, and--or so Rand thought--a
faint hostility. The look lasted but a moment; he raised his hand, and, with a movement that
was both a gesture of welcome and an invitation to follow him, turned and entered the passage
which led to the library. Rand moved in silence through the hall, where Indian curiosities,
horns of elk, and prehistoric relics were arranged above the marble heads of Buonaparte and
Alexander the First, Franklin and Voltaire, and down the narrow passage to the room that had
been almost chief of all his sacred places. It was now somewhat dimly lit, with every window
wide to the night. Jefferson, sitting beside the table in his particular great chair, motioned
the younger man to a seat across from him, evidently placed in anticipation of his coming.
Rand took the chair, but as he did so, he slightly moved the candles upon the table so that
they did not illumine, as they had been placed to illumine, his face and figure. It was he
who began the conversation, and he wasted no time upon preliminaries. The night was in his
blood, and he was weary of half measures. This storm had long been brewing: let it break and
be over with; better the open lightning than the sullen storing up of unpaid scores, unemptied
vials of wrath! There were matters of quarrel: well, let the quarrel come! The supreme matter,
unknown and undreamed of by the philosopher opposite him, would sleep secure beneath the uproar
over little things. He craved the open quarrel. It would be easier after the storm. The air
would be cleared, though by forces that were dire, and he could go more easily through the
forest when he had laid the trees low. It was better to hurry over the bared plain towards
the shining goal than to stumble and be deterred amid these snares of old memories, habits,
affections, and gratitudes. The past--the past was man's enemy. He was committed to the future,
and in order to serve that strong master there was work--disagreeable work--to be done in the
present. Ingratitude!--that, too, was but a word, though a long one. He was willing to deceive
himself, and so ideas and images came at his bidding, but they hung his path with false lights,
and they served, not him, but his inward foe.

He spoke abruptly. "That Militia Bill,--the matter did not approve itself to my reason, and
so I could not push it through. I understood, of course, at the time that you were vexed--"

"I should not say that 'vexed' was the word. I was surprised. You will do me the justice to
acknowledge that I cheerfully accepted the explanation which you gave me. You are fully aware
that I, of all men, would be the last to deny your right--any man's right--of private judgment.
All this was last winter, and might have been buried out of sight."

"I have heard that a letter of mine in the Enquirer gave you umbrage. It was my opinion that
the country's honour demanded less milk and water, less supineness in our dealings with England,
and I expressed my opinion--"

"The country's honour! That expression of your opinion placed you among the critics of the
administration, and that at an hour when every friend was needed. It came without warning,
and if it was meant to wound me, it succeeded."

Rand moved restlessly. "It was not," he said sombrely; "it was not meant to wound you, sir.
Let me, once for all, sitting in this room amid the shades of so many past kindnesses, utterly
disavow any personal feeling toward you other than respect and gratitude. It was apparent to
me that the letter must be written, but I take God to witness that I regretted the necessity."

"The regret," answered the other, "will doubtless, in the sight of the Power you invoke, justify
the performance. Well, the nine days' wonder of the letter is long over! A man in public life
cannot live sixty years without suffering and forgiving many a similar stab. The letter was
in February. Afterwards--"

"I ceased to write to you. Through all the years in which I had written, we had been in perfect
accord. Now I saw the rift between us, and that it would widen, and I threw no futile bridges."

"You are frank. I have indeed letters from you, written in this room"--There was upon the table
an orderly litter of books and papers. From a packet of the latter Jefferson drew a letter,
unfolded it, and, stretching out his long arm, laid it on the table before his visitor. "There
is one," he said, "written not three years ago, on the evening of the day when you were elected
to the General Assembly. I shall ask you to do me the favour to read it through."

Rand took the letter and ran his dark eye down the sheets. As he read, the blood stained his
cheek, brow, and throat, and presently, with a violent movement, he rose and, crossing the
room to a window, stood there with his face to the night. The clock had ticked three minutes
before he turned and, coming back to the table, dropped the letter upon its polished surface.
"You have your revenge," he said. "Yes, I was like that--and less than three years ago. I remember
that night very well, and had a spirit whispered to me then that this night would come, I would
have told the spirit that he lied! And it has come. Let us pass to the next count in the indictment."

"The Albemarle Resolutions--"

"I carried them."

"I wished them carried, but I should rather have seen them lost than that in your speech--a
speech that resounded far and wide--you should have put the face you did upon matters! You
knew my sentiments and convictions; until I read that speech, I thought they were your own.
The Albemarle Resolutions! I have heard it said that your zeal for the Albemarle Resolutions
was largely fanned by the fact that your personal enemy was chief among your opponents!"

"May I ask who said that?"

"You may ask, but I shall not answer. We are now at late February."

"The Assembly adjourned. I returned to Albemarle."

"You took first a journey to Philadelphia."

"Yes. Is there treason in that?"

"That," said Jefferson, with calmness, "is a word not yet of my using."

Rand leaned forward. "Yet?" he repeated, with emphasis.

There fell a silence in the room. After a moment of sitting quietly, his hands held lightly
on the arm of his chair, Mr. Jefferson rose and began to pace the floor. The action was unusual;
in all personal intercourse his command of himself was remarkable. An inveterate cheerful composure,
a still sunniness, a readiness to settle all jars of the universe in an extremely short time
and without stirring from his chair, were characteristics with which Rand was too familiar
not to feel a frowning wonder at the pacing figure and the troubled footfall. He was a man
bold to hardihood, and well assured of a covered trail, so assured that his brain rejected
with vehemence the thought that darted through it. To Mr. Jefferson the word that he had audaciously
used could have no significance. Treason! Traitor! Aaron Burr and his Jack-o'-Lantern ambitions,
indeed, had long been looked upon with suspicion, vague and ill-directed, now slumbering and
now idly alert. In this very room--in this very room the man had been talked of, discussed,
analysed, and puffed away by the two who now held it with their estranged and troubled souls.
Burr was gone; this August night he was floating down the Ohio toward New Orleans and the promised
blow. Had some fool or knave or sickly conscience among the motley that was conspiring with
him turned coward or been bought? It was possible. Burr might be betrayed, but hardly Lewis
Rand. That was a guarded maze to which Mr. Jefferson could have no clue.

Jefferson came back to the table and the great chair. "You were, of course, as free as any
man to travel to Philadelphia or where you would. I heard that you were upon such a journey,
and I felt a certitude that you would also visit Washington. Had you done this, I should have
received you with the old confidence and affection. I should have listened to the explanation
I felt assured you would wish to make. At that time it was my belief that there needed but
one long conversation between us to remove misapprehension, to convince you of your error,
and to recall you to your allegiance. Do not mistake me. I craved no more than was human, no
more than was justified by our relations in the past--your allegiance to me. But I wished to
see you devoutly true to the principles you professed, to the Republican Idea, and to all that
you, no less than I, had once included in that term. I looked for you in Washington, and I
looked in vain."

"You make it hard for me," said Rand, with lowered eyes. "I had no explanation to give."

"When you neither came nor wrote, I assumed as much. It was in April that you returned to Albemarle.
Since then I have myself been twice in the county."

"We have met--"

"But never alone. Had you forgotten the Monticello road? After the Three-Notched Road, I should
have thought it best known to you."

"I have not forgotten it, sir. But I might doubt my welcome here."

"You might well doubt it," answered the other sternly. "But had there been humility in your
heart--ay, or common remembrance!--that doubt would not have kept you back. When I saw at last
that you would not come, I--"

He paused, took from the table a book and turned its leaves, then closed and laid it down again.
"I whistled you down the wind," he said.

There was a silence, then, far away in the hot night, a dog howled. The hall clock struck the
hour. Rand drew his breath sharply and turned in his chair. "And you brought me here to-night
to tell me so?"

"I will answer that presently. In these three years you have made yourself a great name in
Virginia; and now your party--It is still your party?"

"It is still my party."

"Your party wishes to make you Governor. You have travelled fast and far since the days when
you walked with your father! Yesterday I was astounded to hear that you had refused the nomination."

"Why should you be 'astounded'?"

"Because I hold you for a most ambitious man, and this is the plain, the apparent step in your
fortunes. At what goal are you aiming?"

"I did not want the governorship, sir."

"Then you want a greater thing. What it is--what it is"--With a sudden movement he rested his
elbow on the table and regarded Rand from under the shelter of his hand. "And so," he said
at last, in an altered voice,--"and so you will not be Governor. Well, it is an honourable
post. This is late August, and in November you return to Richmond--"

"I go first across the mountains to examine a tract of land I have bought."

"Indeed? When do you go?"

"I have not altogether decided."

"Will you take Mrs. Rand with you?"

"I think so. Yes."

"It is," said Mr. Jefferson, "a rough journey and a wild country for a lady."

As he spoke he rose, and, going to a small table, poured for himself a little wine in a glass
and drank it slowly, then, putting the glass gently down, passed to a long window and stood,
as Rand had stood before him, looking out into the night. When he turned, the expression of
his face had again changed. "It is growing late," he said. "In two days I return to Washington.
The world will have grown older ere we meet again. Who knows? We may never meet again. This
night we may be parting forever. You ask me if I brought you here to tell you that I acquiesced
in this quarrel of your making, shook you from my thoughts, and bade you an eternal farewell.
That is as may be. Even now--even now the nature of our parting is in your hands!"

Rand also had risen. "In this room, what can I say? Your kindness to me has been very great.
My God, sir, I should be stock or stone not to feel abashed! And yet--and yet--Will you have
it at last? You ask discipleship--you must have about you tame and obedient spirits--a Saint
James the Greater and a Saint James the Less to hearken to your words and spread them far and
wide, and all the attentive band to wait upon your wisdom! Free! We are tremendously free,
but you must still be Lord and Master! Well, say that I rebel--"

"I see that you have done so," said Jefferson, with irony. "I am not your Lord and Master."

"I would not, if I could, have shunned this interview to-night. For long we have felt this
strain, and now the sharp break is over. I shall sleep the better for it."

"I am glad, sir, that you view it so."

"For years I have worn your livery and trudged your road,--that fair, wide country road with
bleating sheep and farmer folk, all going to markets dull as death! I've swincked and sweated
for you on that road. Now I'll tread my own, though I come at last to the gates of Tartarus!
My service is done, sir; I'm out of livery."

"Your road!" exclaimed the other. "Where does it lie, and who are your fellow travellers? John
Randolph of Roanoke and the new Republicans? or monarchism and the Federalists? Or have I the
honour, to-night, to entertain a Virginian Cæsar?--perhaps even a Buonaparte?" His voice changed.
"Have you reflected, sir, that there is some danger in so free an expression of your mind?"

"I have reflected," answered Rand, "that there is no danger so intolerable as the chafing of
a half-acknowledged bond. The clock is striking again. I owe you much, sir. I thank you for
it. While I served you, I served faithfully. It is over now. I look you in the face and tell
you this, and so I give you warning that I am free. Henceforth I act as my free will directs."

"Act, then!" said the other. "Act, and find a weight upon your genius heavier than all behests
of duty, friendship, faith, and loyalty rolled in one! Single out from all humanity one man
alone, and that yourself, surround him with a monstrous observance, sacrifice before him every
living thing that shall cross his path, crown him with gold, and banish from his court every
idea that will not play the sycophant! Seat him, a chained king, high in some red star!--and
still, like a wandering wind, large and candid thought, straying some day past your gloomy
windows, shall look within and say, 'See this slave to himself chained upon his burning throne!'
When at last you hear the voice, try to break away."

He left the window and, crossing to the mantel, pulled the bell-rope. Old Burwell appeared
at the door. "Mr. Rand's horse, Burwell," directed the master, in a cheerful voice, then, when
the negro was gone, spoke on without change of tone. "The night has altered while we talked.
There is a great bank of cloud in the west, and I think the drouth is broken. You will reach
Roselands, however, before the rain comes down. Pray present my respectful salutations to Mrs.
Rand."

"You are very good," said Rand. "My wife"--He hesitated, then, "I would have you aware that
my wife's hand would keep me in that same country road I spoke of, among those same green fields
and peaceful, blameless folk! Her star is not like mine--"

"I esteem her the more highly for it," answered the other. "I hear your horse upon the gravel--Selim,
still, is it not? A pleasant ride to you home through this fresher air! Good-night--and good-bye."

"I am not the monster I appear to you," said Rand. "A man may go through life and never encounter
the irresistible current. When he does--I am as little superstitious as you, but I tell you
I am borne on! All the men and women whose blood is in my veins hurry me on, and there is behind
me a tide of circumstance. For all past kindnesses I thank you, sir. I admire you much, reverence
you no little, and bid you a long farewell."

He walked to the door, then, turning, swept the room with one slow look. "I was fifteen," he
said, "the day I first came here. There was a glass of lilies on the table. Good-night, sir,--and
good-bye."

Without, the night was indeed cooler, with a sighing wind, and in the west a thickening wrack
of clouds. It was very dark. The restless and multitudinous flicker of the fireflies but emphasized
the shadow, and the stars seemed few and dim. It was near midnight, and the wide landscape
below the mountain lay in darkness, save for one distant knoll where lights were burning. That
was Fontenoy, and Rand, looking toward it with knitted brows, wondered why the house was so
brightly lighted at such an hour. In another moment the road descended, the heavy trees shut
out the view of the valley, and with very much indeed upon his mind, he thought no more of
Fontenoy. It was utterly necessary to him to find a remedy for the sting, keen and intolerable,
which he bore with him from Monticello. He felt the poison as he rode, and his mind searched,
in passion and in haste, for the sovereign antidote. He found it and applied it, and the rankling
pain grew less. Now more than ever was it necessary to go on. Now more than ever he must commit
himself without reserve to the strong current. When it had borne him to a fair and far country,
to kingship, sway, empire, and vast renown, then would this night be justified!

He left the mountain, and, riding rapidly, soon found himself upon the road to Roselands. It
was also the Greenwood road. Between the two plantations lay a deep wood, and as he emerged
from this, he saw before him in the dim starlight a horseman, coming towards him from Roselands.
"Is that you, Mocket?" he called.

The other drew rein. "It is Ludwell Cary. Good-evening, Mr. Rand. I have just left Roselands."

"Indeed?" exclaimed Rand. "May I ask--"

"I came from Fontenoy at the request of Colonel Churchill. Mrs. Churchill fell suddenly very
ill to-night. They think she will not last many hours, and she asks continually for her niece.
Colonel Churchill sent me to beg Mrs. Rand to come without delay to Fontenoy. I have delivered
my message, and she but waits your return to Roselands--"

"I will hurry on," said Rand. "Be so good as to tell Colonel Churchill that Joab will bring
her in the chaise--Mammy Chloe with her. I am sorry for your news. Accept, too, our thanks
for the trouble to which you have put yourself--"

"It is nothing," answered Cary. "My brother and I chanced to be at Fontenoy. Mrs. Rand is much
distressed, and I'll detain you no longer--"

He bowed, touched his horse, and rode into the wood. Rand turned in his saddle and looked after
him for a long moment, then shook his reins, broke into a gallop, and passed presently through
the Roselands gates and up the dark drive to the stone steps and open door. Jacqueline met
him on the threshold. She was trembling, but not weeping; there was even a wistful fire and
passion in her dark eyes and a rose-leaf colour in her cheeks. "Did you meet him?" she said.
"Did he tell you? I am all ready. He says that Aunt Nancy thinks that it is years ago, and
that I'm Jacqueline Churchill still. I thought you would never, never come"--She turned and
threw herself into his arms. "Oh, Lewis, we are going to Fontenoy!"

CHAPTER XX

THE NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY

"That's true," quoth Gaudylock. "It's the cracked I pitcher that goes oftenest to the well,
and a delicate lady that's lain a-dying on her bed this twenty year may live to see you and
me and the blacksmith buried! There never was a Churchill that I didn't like, and I'm certainly
glad she's better this morning. If you're going to Greenwood, I'll bear you company for a bit.
I'm bound for Roselands myself."

Ludwell Cary dismounted and, with his bridle across his arm, walked beside the hunter. "Albemarle
has not seen you for a long while," he said pleasantly. "The county is fond of you, and glad
to have you home again."

"So a lady told me the other day!" answered Adam. "It has been a year since I was in Albemarle,--but
I saw you, sir, last winter in Richmond."

"Last winter? I don't recall--"

"At Lynch's Coffee House. The twentieth of February. The day the Albemarle Resolutions were
passed."

"Ah!" breathed Cary. The two walked on, now in sun, now in shade, upon the quiet road. The
drouth was broken. There had been a torrential rain, then two days of sunshine. A cool wind
now stirred the treetops; the mountains drew closer in the crystal air, and the washed fields
renewed their green. So bright and sunny was the morning that the late summer wore the air
of spring. Cary stood still beside a log, huge and mossy, that lay beside the road. "Let us
rest here a moment," he said, and, taking his seat, began to draw in the dust before him with
the butt of his whip. "I do not remember seeing you that day. I did not know that you were
in Richmond."

"I was there," answered Adam cheerfully, "on business." He took an acorn from the ground and
balanced it upon a brown forefinger. "It's a handsome place--Lynch's--and, my faith, one sees
the best of company! I was there with Lewis Rand."

"Ah!"

The sound was sharp, and long like an indrawn breath. Adam, who could read the tones of a man's
voice, glanced aside and remembered the quarrel. "Thin ice there, and crackling twigs!" he
thought. "Look where you set your moccasin, Golden-Tongue!" Aloud he said, "You and your brother
came in out of the snow, and read your letters by the fire. It had fallen thick the day before."

"Yes, I remember. A heavy fall all day, but at night it cleared."

"Yes," went on the other blithely. "I was at Lewis Rand's on Shockoe Hill, and when I walked
home, the stars were shining. What's the matter, sir?"

"Nothing. Why?"

"I thought," quoth Adam, "that some varmint had stung you." He looked thoughtfully at the acorn.
"You are a schollard, Mr. Cary. Is the whole oak, root, branch, and seed, in the acorn--bound
to come out just that way?"

"So they say," answered Cary. "And in the invisible acorn of that oak a second tree, and that
second holds a third, and the third a fourth, and so on through the magic forest. Consequences
to the thousandth generation. You were saying that you were at Mr. Rand's the night of the
nineteenth of February."

"Was I?" asked Adam, with coolness. "Oh, yes! I went over to talk with him about a buffalo
skin and some antlers of elk that he wanted for Roselands--and the stars were shining when
I came away." To himself he said, "Now why did he start like that a moment back? It wasn't
because the snow had stopped and the stars were shining. Where was he that night?"

Cary drew a circle in the dust with the handle of his whip. "You were at Lynch's with Mr. Rand
the next afternoon. And immediately after that you returned to the West?"

Adam nodded. The acorn was yet poised upon his finger, but his keen blue eyes were for the
other's face and form, bent over the drawing in the dusty road. "Ay, West I went," he said
cheerfully. "I'm just a born wanderer! I can't any more stay in one town than a bird can stay
on one bush."

"A born wanderer," said Cary pleasantly, "is almost always a born good fellow. How long this
time will be your stay in Albemarle?"

"Why, that's as may be," answered Adam, with vagueness. "I'm mighty fond of this country in
the fall of the year, and I've a hankering for an old-time Christmas at home--But, my faith;
wanderers never know when the fit will take them! It may be to-morrow, and it may be next year."

"You and Mr. Rand are old friends?"

"You may say that," exclaimed the hunter. "There's a connection somewhere between the Gaudylocks
and the Rands, and I knew Gideon better than most men. As for Lewis, I reckon there was a time
when I was almost his only friend. I've stood between him and many a beating, and 'twas I that
taught him to shoot. A fine place he's making out of Roselands!"

"Yes," agreed Cary, with a quick sigh; "a beautiful place. The West is in a ferment just now,
is it not? One hears much talk of dissatisfaction."

"Why, all that sort of thing is told me when I come home," said Adam. "The Indians call such
idle speech talk of singing birds. My faith, I think all the singing birds in the Mississippi
Territory have flown East! In the West we don't listen to them. That's a fine mare you're riding,
sir! You should see the wild horses start up from the prairie grass."

"That would be worth seeing. Have you ever, in your wanderings, come across Aaron Burr?"

Adam regarded the other side of the acorn. "Aaron Burr! Why, I wouldn't say that I mayn't have
seen him somewhere. A man who traps and trades, and hunts and fishes, up and down a thousand
miles of the Mississippi River is bound to come across a mort of men. But 'twould be by accident.
He's a gentleman and a talker, and he was the Vice-President. I reckon he runs with the Governor
and the General and the gentleman-planter and the New Orleans ladies." Adam laughed genially.
"I know a red lip or two in New Orleans myself, but they're not ladies! and I drink with the
soldiers, but not with the General. What's your interest, sir, in Aaron Burr?"

"The common interest," said Cary, rising. "When you quit Albemarle this time, you quit it alone?"

Gaudylock tossed aside the acorn. "That is my fortune," he answered coolly.

Cary swung himself into his saddle. "The woods, I see, teach but half the Spartan learning.
We'll part here, I think, unless you'll come by Greenwood?"

"Thank you kindly, sir, but I've a bit of a woodsman's job to look after at Roselands. What
was the Spartan learning?"

"You are going," replied the other, "to the house of a gentleman who knows the classics. Ask
him. Good-day!"

"Good-day," said Adam somewhat abruptly, and with a thoughtful face watched the other ride
away. "He has been listening," thought the hunter, "to singing birds. Now when, and where,
and to how loud a singing? The nineteenth of February--and the snowstorm--and the stars shining
as I walked home from Shockoe Hill. He didn't know that I was in Richmond! Then, was he on
Burr's trail? Humph! Where was Mr. Ludwell Cary the night of the nineteenth of February?" Adam
took up his gun and coonskin cap. "I'll see if Lewis can make that light," he said, and turned
his face to Roselands.

Ludwell Cary rode to Greenwood, dismounted, and, going into the library, took from the drawer
of his desk a letter, opened it, and ran it over. "As to your enquiries," said the letter,
"Swartwout and Bollman are believed to be in New Orleans, Ogden in Kentucky, and Aaron Burr
himself at a Mr. Harman Blennerhassett's on the Ohio. Rumour has it that Burr's daughter and
her son are travelling to meet him. It says, moreover, that a number of gentlemen in the East
are winding up their affairs preparatory to leaving for the West. One and all look more innocent
than lambs, but they dream at night of sénoritas, besieged cities, and the mines of Montezuma!
There's a report to-day that Burr is levying troops. That's war. If these men go, they'll not
return." Cary laid down the letter. "If these men go, they'll not return. Is Lewis Rand so
fixed in Albemarle?"

He moved from the desk to an old chess table and, sitting down, began to move the pieces this
way and that. "The nineteenth of February--the nineteenth of February." He saw again a firelit
room, and heard the tapping of maple boughs against a window. There she sat in her dress of
festive white, listening to a denunciation of Aaron Burr and those concerned with him--and
all the time the man beneath her roof! Cary sighed impatiently and moved another piece. Adam
Gaudylock, who had let slip that he had been there as well--and then had been careful to let
slip no other fact of value, except, indeed, the fact that he was thus careful! Cary covered
his lips with his hand and sat staring at the board. The problem, then, was to construct from
the hunter's character the hunter's part. A keen trader, scout, and enthusiast of the West,
known to and knowing the men of those parts, and able to bend the undercurrents--a delighter
in danger, with a boy's zest for intrigue, risk, and daring--an uncomplex mind, little troubled
by theories of political obligation, political faith and unfaith, loyalty to government or
its reverse--a being born to adventure, but to adventure under guidance, skilled and gay subaltern
to some graver, abler leader--that, he thought, would be Adam Gaudylock. An old, old friend
of Lewis Rand's--"There's a connection somewhere between the Gaudylocks and the Rands."

Cary put out his hand and moved a piece with suddenness. "Granted the connection," he said
aloud. His eye gleamed. "That night Rand agreed with Burr. Gaudylock would have been there
to give information; probably, seeing that he went West immediately afterwards, to receive
instructions. But he is an asset of Lewis Rand's, not of Burr's."

His hand touched the piece again. "An asset of Lewis Rand's--Rand and Burr--Rand and Burr.
What was it that they plotted that night while she talked to me of the new song she had learned?
An expedition against Mexico, an attack upon the dominions of the King of Spain with whom we
are at peace? Or a revolution in the country west of the Ohio? The one's a misdemeanour; the
other's treason." He moved a rook. "Most like 'twas both--the first to mask the second. The
boldest, simplest, most comprehensive stroke; there, there would show the mind of Lewis Rand!"

He rose and paced the long, cool room, then came back to the chess table. "They parted. Burr
to the North, as I found the next morning; this trader, as he says, back to the West; Lewis
Rand quiet in Richmond, quiet here in Albemarle. Quiet! That speech of his--those letters in
the Enquirer. How long has he been breaking with Mr. Jefferson? That journey, too, to Philadelphia--whom
did he see there? Swartwout, Bollman, perhaps Burr himself? Home he comes to Albemarle and
begins improving Roselands. Cases too, in court, and a queue of waiting clients, and Richmond
to return to in November. Granted there's a strange emigration West; but Lewis Rand--Lewis
Rand's as fixed in Virginia as are the Churchills and the Carys!"

He slowly lifted and as slowly moved a queen. "And what other course, from time out of mind,
does the disloyal pursue? A mask--all a mask. He, too, is for the West. He goes to join Burr;
goes, if his fate stands true, to supplant Burr. Matters draw to a point, and he has little
time to spare! Say that he goes"--A movement of his arm, involuntary and sharp, jarred the
table and disarranged the board. "Will he go alone?"

Cary rose and walked the floor. "I must know--I must know." He paused at a western window,
and with unseeing eyes gazed into the blue distance. "Were he Ludwell Cary, would he fare forth
on his adventure alone? Perhaps. Being Lewis Rand, will he go without her, leave her behind?
A thousand times, no! Even now this daughter of Burr's is hurrying by day and by night over
rough and over smooth, to join her father; how much more, then, shall lover go with lover,
the faithful wife with the all-conquering husband! She shall be there to buckle on our armour,
to heal us with her kiss when the long day's work is over!" He bent his brow upon his arm.
"O God, O God!"

From the hall without there sounded a clear whistle, and Fairfax Cary appeared in the library
door. "Are you there, Ludwell? It's all dark in here after the sun outside. I am going to town."

The elder brother left the window. "Wait a little, Fair. I want to talk to you. Do you remember
the night of the nineteenth of February?"

"Yes," said the other. "It had been snowing, and then it cleared brilliantly. I went to the
Mayos, and I stopped by Bowler's Tavern. It was the night that Aaron Burr slept in Richmond.
I told you, you know, that he was supping out."

"Yes. With Lewis Rand."

There was a silence, then, "So!" exclaimed Fairfax Cary, with a long whistle.

"You are not surprised?"

"No. It explains."

"Yes," assented the other sombrely, "it explains. Fair, I want to find out when Adam Gaudylock
goes West."

"Gaudylock!" cried the other; then after a moment, "Well, I'm not surprised at that, either.
I can tell you now when he's going. In two weeks' time."

"How do you know?"

"Unity sent a message about some work or other to Tom Mocket's sister Vinie. I gave the message,
and the girl fell to talking about Adam. She was wearing a Spanish comb which he had brought
her. I told her 't was pretty, and she said 'Yes: 'twas from New Orleans, and if Miss Unity
would like one, Mr. Adam was going there again in two weeks.'"

"Two weeks!" brooded the other. "Fair, would you not say from every appearance that Lewis Rand
is as fixed in Albemarle and in Virginia as you or I or any honest man? He improves Roselands;
he has an important case coming on; it is supposed that in November he will return to Richmond.
I happen to know that he has retaken the house on Shockoe Hill." He moved restlessly. "Why
should I dream that he is preparing a moonlight flitting? dream that I see him in the gold
southwest, treading his appointed road, triumphant there as here? A moonlight flitting! When
he goes, he'll go by day--walk forth in bronze and purple, unconcerned and confident, high
and bold as any Cæsar! From what egg did he spring that he can play the traitor and the parricide--and
yet, and yet the rose bend to his hand? Does it look, Fair, as though he were in marching order?"

The other considered. "Do you believe that he is going West to join Burr?"

"I do. And yet this week he is defending a case in court, and there are others coming on. He
is busy, too, at Roselands, and he has taken the Richmond house. I am, perhaps, a suspicious,
envious, and vindictive fool."

"Roselands and the Richmond house might be a mask, He refused the nomination for Governor."

Ludwell Cary started violently. "I had forgotten that! You have it, Fair. He would do that--he
would refuse the nomination. Lewis Rand, Lewis Rand!"

"Have you any proof that he is conspiring with Burr?"

"None that I could advance--none. I have an inward certainty, that is all. Nor can I--nor can
I, Fair, even speak of such a suspicion. You see that?"

"Yes, I see that."

"I repented last winter of having written that letter signed 'Aurelius.' I knew nothing, and
it seemed beneath me to have made that guesswork public. That he was my enemy should have made
me careful, but I was under strong feeling, and I wrote. He has neither forgotten nor forgiven.
Denounce him now as a conspirator against his party and his country? That is impossible. Impossible
from lack of proof, and impossible to me were proofs as thick as blackberries! But if I can
help it, he shall not leave Virginia."

"Is it your opinion that he would take her with him?"

"Yes, it is."

"Would she go?"

Cary rose, moved to the window, and stood there a moment in silence. When, presently, he came
back to the table, his face was pale, but lifted, controlled, and quiet. There was a saying
in the county,--"The high look of the Carys." He wore it now, the high look of the Carys. "Yes,
Fair, she would go with him."

There was a silence, then the younger spoke. "She is at Fontenoy. Mrs. Churchill may linger
long, and her niece is always with her. Rand could not take his wife away."

"It's a check to his plans, no doubt," said the other wearily.

"He's frowning over it now. He'll wait as long as may be. He would sin, but he would not sin
meanly. In his conception of himself a greatness, even in transgression, must clothe all that
he does. He'll wait, gravely and decently, even though to wait is his heavy risk." He made
a gesture with his hand. "Do I not know him, know him well? Sometimes I think that for three
years I've had no other study!"

"You should have let me challenge him that first election day," said Fairfax Cary gloomily.
"If we had met and I had put a bullet through him, then all this coil would have been spared.
What do you propose to do now?"

"At the moment I am going to Fontenoy."

"I would speak, I think, to Major Edward."

"Yes: that was in my mind. If there is any right, it lies with the men of her family. Fair,
on the nineteenth of February I was at Lewis Rand's!"

"Ah!" exclaimed his brother.

"I was admitted, as I have since come to see, by mistake, and against orders. I found her alone
in her drawing-room, and we sat by the dying fire and we talked of this very thing, this very
plot, this very Aaron Burr--yes, and of the part a stronger than Burr might play in the West
and in Mexico! She told me that her husband was busy that night--excused him because he was
engaged with a client from the country. A client from the country! and I, who would have taken
her word against an angel's, I sat there and wondered why she was distrait and pale! She was
pale because there was danger, she was absent because she was contriving how she might soonest
rid the house of one who was not wanted there that night! She was dressed in gauze and gems;
she had supped with Aaron Burr--"

"I see--I see!"

"When at last I perceived, though I could not guess the reason, that she wished to be alone,
I bade her good-night, and she watched me--oh, carefully!--through the hall and past the other
doors and out of the house. I came home through the starlight and over the snow to the Eagle.
I found you there by the fire, and you told me that Aaron Burr was in Richmond. Then, then,
Fair, I knew. I knew with whom Lewis Rand was engaged, I knew who was the client from the country!
The next morning I made my inquiries. Burr had gone at dawn, muffled and secret and swift--one
man to see him off. That man, I learned to-day, was Adam Gaudylock. He, too, was at Rand's
the night before. A triumvirate, was it not? Well, she knew, she knew--and women, too, have
dreamed of crowns!"

He rose. "I'm going to ride to Fontenoy. You can bear me witness that I've kept away since
her return. Now I shall keep away no longer. I will speak to Major Edward. Her family may draw
a circle out of which she may not step."

"There's been," said the other, "no true reconciliation. She's only at Fontenoy because the
Churchills could not refuse a dying woman. They speak to her as to a stranger to whom, as gentlemen,
they must needs be courteous. And she's proud, too. Unity says they are far apart."

"I know. But though the Churchill men are stubborn, they are Virginians and they are patriots.
This touches their honour and the honour of their house. If Rand plots at all, he's plotting
treason. How much does she know, how little does she not know? God knows, not I! But they may
make a circle she cannot overstep--no, not for all the magician's piping!" He rested his forehead
upon his clasped hands. "Fair, Fair, she was my Destiny! Why did he come like a shape of night,
with the power of night? And now he draws her, too, into the shadow. He's treading a road beset--and
they are one flesh; she travels with him. Oh, despair!"

"Have out a warrant against him."

"What proofs? and what disgrace if proved! No, Fair, no."

"Then let me challenge him."

The other smiled. "Should it come to that, I will be the challenger! I am your senior there.
Don't forget it, Fair." He rose from the table. "Do you remember that first day we rode to
Fontenoy when I came home from England? The place was all in sunshine, all fine gold. She was
standing on the porch beside Major Edward; she lifted her hand and shaded her eyes with a fan--there
was a flower in her hair. Three years! I am worn with those three years." For a moment he rested
his hand on the other's shoulder. "Fair, Fair, you know happy love--may you never know unhappy
love! I am going now to Fontenoy. Is there a message for Unity?"

CHAPTER XXI

THE CEDAR WOOD

Jacqueline closed the door of her aunt's chamber softly behind her, passed through the Fontenoy
hall, and came out upon the wide porch. There, in the peace of the September afternoon, she
found Unity alone with the Lay of the Last Minstrel. "Aunt Nancy is asleep," she said. "I left
Mammy Chloe beside her. Unity, I think she's better."

"So the doctor said this morning."

"I think she's beginning to remember. She looks strangely at me."

"If she does remember, she'll want you still!"

Jacqueline shook her head. "I think not. How lovely it is, this afternoon! The asters are all
in bloom in the garden, and the gum tree is turning red." She threw a gauze scarf over her
head. "I am going down to the old gate by the narrow road."

"I wish," said Unity, "that I had the ordering of the universe for just one hour! Then Christians
would become Christian, and you wouldn't have to meet your husband outside the gates of home."

The other laughed a little. "Oh, Unity, Christians won't be Christian, and even as it is, 'tis
sweet to be at home! Until you go away to Greenwood, you'll not know how dear was Fontenoy!
To hear the poplars rustling and to smell the box again--Is it not strange that I should have
a light heart when they look so cold upon me?"

"I have hopes of Uncle Dick, but Uncle Edward"--Unity shook her head. "I don't understand Uncle
Edward."

"I do," answered Jacqueline, "and I love him most. I'll go now and leave you to the Last Minstrel.
Does Fairfax Cary come to-night?"

"He may--"

Jacqueline laughed. "'He may.' Yes, indeed, I think he may! Oh, Unity, smell the roses, and
look at the light upon the mountains! Good-bye! I'm for Lewis now."

She passed down the steps and through the garden toward the cedar wood which led to the old
gate on the narrow road. Unity heard her singing as she went. The voice died in the distance.
A door opened, Uncle Edward's step was heard in the hall, and his voice, harsh and strange,
came out to his niece upon the porch: "Unity, I want you in the library a moment."

Jacqueline kept her tryst with Rand under the great oak that stood without the old gate, on
land that was not the Churchills'. It was their custom to walk a little way into the wood that
lay hard by, but this afternoon the narrow road, grass-grown and seldom used, was all their
own. They sat upon the wayside, beneath the tree, and Selim grazed beside them. There was her
full report of all that concerned them both, and there was what he chose to tell her. They
talked of Fontenoy, and then of Roselands--talked freely and with clasped hands. Her head rested
on his shoulder; they sat in deep accord, bathed by the golden light of the afternoon; sometimes
they were silent for minutes at a time, while the light grew fairer on the hills. When an hour
had passed they rose and kissed, and he watched her across the road and through the gate into
the circle of Fontenoy. She turned, and waited to see him mount Selim and ride away. He spoke
from the saddle, "At the same hour to-morrow," and she answered, "The same hour." Her hands
were clasped upon the top-most bar of the gate. He wheeled Selim, crossed the road, half swung
himself from the saddle, and pressed his lips upon them. "Come home soon!" he said, and she
answered, "Soon."

When the bend of the road had hidden horse and rider, she left the gate and began her return
to the house. Her path lay through a field, through the cedar wood, and through the flower
garden. In the field beside a runlet grew masses of purple ironweed. She broke a stately piece,
half as tall as herself, and with it in her hand left the autumn-coloured field and entered
the little wood where the cedars grew dark and close, with the bare, red earth beneath. At
the end of the aisle of trees could be seen the bright-hued garden and a fraction of blue heaven.
Holding the branch of ironweed before her, Jacqueline passed through the wood toward the light
of sky and flowers, and came at the edge of the open space upon a large old tree, twisted like
one of those which Dante saw. As she stepped beneath the dark and spreading boughs a man, leaving
the sunlit flower garden for the shadow of the cedars, met her face to face. "You!" he cried,
and stopped short.

The branch of ironweed dropped from her hand. "I did not know that you were at Fontenoy. I
have not seen you this long while--except for that moment the other night. Is it not--is it
not the loveliest day?"

"I came from the library into the flower garden and on to this wood because I wished to think,
to be alone, to gain composure before I returned to the house--and you front me like a spectre
in the dimness! Once before, I entered this wood from the flower garden--and it was dark, dark
as it is to-day, though the weather was June. Nor do I, either, count the other night when
I came to Roselands as Colonel Churchill's messenger. It has been long, indeed, since we truly
met."

"You are not well, Mr. Cary!"

"I am--I am," said Cary. "Give me a moment."

He rested his arm against the red trunk of the cedar and covered his eyes with his hand. Jacqueline
stood, looking not at him but at the coloured round of garden. Her heart was fluttering, she
knew not why. The moment that he asked went by and, dropping his arm, he turned upon her a
face that he had not yet schooled to calmness.

"The evening of the nineteenth of February," he said. "That was the last time we really met.
Do you remember?"

"Yes, I remember. It was the day of the deep snow."

Cary regarded her mutely; then, "Yes, that was the important thing. We all remember it because
of the snow. You were learning a new song that you promised to sing to me when I came again.
But I never heard it--I never came again."

"I know. Why was that?"

"Do you ask?" he cried, and there was pain and anger in his voice. "I thought it not of you."

The crimson surged over Jacqueline's face and throat. She bent toward him impetuously, with
a quick motion of her hands. "Ah, forgive me!" she cried. "I know--I know. I was told of the
quarrel next day in the coffee house. I--I was more sorry than I can say. I understood. You
could not, after that, come again to the house. Oh, more than almost anything, I wish that
you and Lewis were friends! It is wrong to try to make you think that that evening does not
live in my memory. It does--it does!"

"I am willing to believe as much," he returned, with a strange dryness. "I know that you remember
that evening, but I hardly think it altogether on my account--"

The colour faded from her cheek. "On whose, then? My husband's?"

"And your guest's."

"You were my guest."

"Oh," cried Cary, "I'll not have it! You shall not so perjure yourself! He has taken much from
me; if your truth is his as well, then indeed he has taken all! I know, I know who was the
guest that night, the man with whom you supped, the 'client from the country.'"

She gazed at him with large eyes, her hand upon her heart, then, with an inarticulate word
or two, she moved to the gnarled and protruding roots of the cedar and took her seat there
facing his troubled figure and indignant eyes. "Who was the guest,--the client from the country?"

"Aaron Burr."

She drew a difficult breath. "How long have you known?"

"Since that night. No--do not be distressed! I learned it not from you,--you kept faithful
guard. But when I left you, within the hour I knew it."

"And--and if he were there, what harm?"

Cary regarded her in silence; then, "The letter that I read you that night from your uncle,
from one of the heads of your house, from a patriot and a man of stainless honour, that letter
was, I think, sufficiently explicit! There was the harm. But Major Churchill's opinion, too,
is perhaps forgot."

"No," cried Jacqueline, "no; you do not understand! Listen to me!" She rose, drawing herself
to her full height, the red again in her cheek, her eyes dark and bright. "I am going to tell
you the truth of this matter. Are you not my friend, whose opinion I value for me and mine?
You are a true and honourable gentleman--I speak with no fear that what I say will ever pass
beyond this wood! Uncle Edward's letter! You think that what was said in Uncle Edward's letter--ay,
and what you, too, said in comment--was already known to me that night! Well, it was not. Oh,
it is true that Colonel Burr had supped with us, and it is also true that I was most heartily
sorry for it! At table, while he talked, I saw only that green field so far away, and General
Hamilton bleeding to his death,--yes, and I thought, 'Oh me, what would they say to me at Fontenoy?'
But I knew no worse of Colonel Burr than that one deed, and I bore myself toward him as any
woman must toward her husband's guest! I am telling you all. He was Lewis's guest, Lewis's
correspondent, and this was an arranged meeting. I knew that and I knew no more. After supper
they talked together, and I sat alone by the fire in the empty drawing-room. I was bidden--yes,
I will tell you this!--I was bidden to keep all visitors out, since it must not be known that
Colonel Burr was then in Richmond! You came, and by mistake you were admitted. I was lonely
at heart and hungry for news from home, I let you stay, and you read to me what my uncle had
to say of the man who was at that instant beneath my roof, engaged in talk with my husband!
You read, and then you, too, took up the tale! 'Traitor--treason.... A man whom, had you the
power, you would arrest at once.... False to his honour, false to his country.... Traitor and
maker of traitors.... And where is your husband to-night?' Well, I did not choose to tell you
where was my husband that night--and, since I was frightened, and cold at heart, and knew not
what to say, and--and was frightened, I lied to you! But as for that which I now see that you
have thought of me--you are much mistaken there! Until you read me Uncle Edward's letter, I
did not know what men said of Aaron Burr!"

"I wronged you," said Cary, with emotion. "I doubted you, and I have been most wretched in
the doubting. Forgive me!"

"You wronged me, yes!" she cried. "But am I the only one you've wronged? Oh, I see, I see what
since that night you have thought of Lewis! It was the next day that you quarrelled in the
coffee house! Oh, all these months, have you been mistrusting Lewis Rand, believing him concerned
with that man, suspecting him of--of--of treason? There, too, you are mistaken. Listen!"

She came closer to him, all colour, light, and fire against the dark cedars. "I am going to
tell you. You are generous, open-minded, candid, fair--you will understand, and you will know
him better, and you and he may yet be friends! I have that at heart--you would hardly believe
how much I have that at heart. Have you been dreaming of Lewis Rand as the aider and abetter
of Colonel Burr's designs, whatever they may be! as a conspirator with him against the peace
of the country, against Virginia, against the Republic? You have, you have,--I read it in your
face! Well, you are wrong. Oh, I will tell you the clean truth! He was tempted--he saw below
him the kingdoms of the earth--and oh, remember that around him are not the friendly arms,
the old things, the counsel of the past, the watchword in the blood, the voice that cries to
you or to my uncles and so surely points to you the road! I will tell the whole truth. I will
not say that his mind sees always by the light by which we rest. He has come another way and
through another world. How should he think our thoughts, see just with our eyes? He has come
through night and hurrying clouds; his way has been steep, and there are stains upon his nature.
I that love him will not deny them! He was tempted as Ludwell Cary would not have been. Oh,
perhaps if I had not been there, he would have made his compact. But I was there! and I besought
him--and that night he swore to me--"

Cary threw out his arm with a cry. "Stop, stop! I take God to witness that I never thought
of this!"

She went on, unheeding. "He swore to me that whatever in that world of his he had thought of
Aaron Burr and of his projects, however keenly he had seen the dazzling fortune that lay in
that western country, yet, as I had left my world for his, so would he leave that night, in
this, his world for mine! And he did so--he did so that night before the dawn!"

She raised her hand to her eyes and dashed away the bright drops. "You have done an injustice.
All this time you have thought him what that night you called Aaron Burr. I know not where
Colonel Burr is now, but since the night of the nineteenth of February, he and my husband have
had no dealings."

"My God!" said Cary, in a low voice; then, "This is all your assurance?"

"All?" she echoed proudly. "It is enough."

He turned away and, walking to the edge of the wood, stood there, striving for some measure
of self-command. His hands opened and shut. Lewis Rand was a perjured traitor, and it only
remained to tell Jacqueline as much.

The garden swam before his eyes, then the mist passed and he saw with distinctness. There was
a path before him that led away between walls of box to the green and flowery heart of the
place, and at the heart was a summer-house. He saw it all again. There was the morning in June,
there was the blowing rose, there was the sudden vision--Rand and Jacqueline, hand in hand,
with mingled breath! It was into this path that he had turned--it was to this wood that he
had stumbled, leaving them there. He felt again the icy shock, the death and wormwood in his
soul. They had had the gold, they had loved and embraced while, with his face to the earth,
he had lain there beneath that tree where now she stood. Well, Time's globe was turning--there
were shadows now for the lovers' country! Their land, too, would have its night; perhaps an
endless night. He entertained the fierce, triumphant thought, but not for long. He had loved
Jacqueline Churchill truly, and her happiness was more to him than his own. When, presently,
he reached the consideration of her in that darkened country, moving forever over ash and cinder
beneath an empty, leaden heaven, he found the contemplation intolerable. A tenderness crept
into his heart, divine enough as things go in the heart of man. The summer-house mocked him
still, and the image of Rand walked with armed foot through every chamber of his brain, but
he wished no worse for Jacqueline than unending light and love. After the first red moment,
it was not possible to him to put out one lamp, to break one flower, in her paradise. It hung
like a garden in Babylon over the dust and sorrow of the common way, over the gulf of broken
gods and rent illusions. To jar that rainbow tenure by the raising of his voice, to bring that
phantom bliss whirling down to the trodden street, lay not within the quality of the man. He
closed his eyes and fought with the memory of that June morning when he and Colonel Churchill
had come upon the summer-house; fought with that and with a hundred memories besides, then
looked again, and quietly, at the autumn place, bright with late flowers and breathed over
by the haunting fragrance of the box. Another moment and he turned back to the wood and the
great tree.

Jacqueline sat beneath the cedar, the branch of ironweed again within her hand. She had found
it natural that Ludwell Cary should turn away. It was not easy to struggle against a misconception,
to re-marshal facts and revise judgments--often it was hard. She waited quietly, fingering
the tufts of purple bloom, her eyes upon the clear sky between the cedar boughs. When at last
she heard his step and looked up, it was with an exquisite kindness in her large, dark eyes.
"It was a natural mistake," she said. "Do not think that I blame you. It is hard to believe
in good when we think we see evil."

"I am thankful," he answered, "that you are back in your shrine. Forgive me my error."

She looked at him fixedly. "But concerning Lewis--there, too, was error. Why should you continue
enemies?"

There was a silence, then Cary spoke, sadly and bitterly. "You must leave me that. There are
men who are born to be antagonists. When that is so, they find each other out over half the
world, and circumstance may be trusted to square for them a battle-ground. Mr. Rand and I,
I fear, will still be enemies."

"Then what I have told you makes no difference--"

"You are mistaken there. What you have told me shall have its weight."

"Why, then," cried Jacqueline, "you cannot judge him as you have been judging throughout a
spring and summer! You are just and generous--will you not try to be friends? Ere this men
have left off being foes, and many and many a battlefield is now thick with wild flowers. I
should be happy if you and Lewis would clasp hands."

Her voice was persuasion's own, and there was a tremulous smile upon her red lips, and a soft
light in her dark eyes. "There is a thing that I have long divined," she said, "and that is
the strange regard for what you think and what you are that exists deep, deep down in his mind.
It lies so deep that he is mainly ignorant that it is there. He thinks that you and he are
all inimical. But it is there like an ancient treasure far down in the ocean depths, far below
the surface storm. There is in him a preoccupation with you. Often and often, when questions
of right and wrong arise, I know that his thought descends to that secret place where he keeps
an image of you! I know that he interrogates that image, 'Is it thus or so that you would do?'
And if, at times, scornfully or sullenly or with indifference, he does the opposite to what
the image says, yet none the less at the next decision will his thought fly to that same judgment
bar! It is an attraction that he fights against, a habit of the mind that he would break if
he could--but it is there--indeed, indeed it is there! It is despotic--I do not think that
he can escape. Ah, if you and he were friends, you would be friends indeed!" She looked at
him pleadingly, with her hand outstretched.

Cary shook his head. "You are mistaken," he said harshly. "I am conscious of no place where
my spirit and that of Mr. Rand may touch. I cannot explain; we are enemies: you must let us
fight it out."

"Does it so much matter that you are Federalist and he Republican?"

"It matters very little."

"Or that you are a Cary, with all that that means, while he is Lewis Rand from the Three-Notched
Road?"

"That matters not at all."

"Or that you are rival lawyers? Or that in politics he has defeated you? Or--Oh, my friend,
now I am dealing unjustly! Forgive me--forgive me and make friends!"

"Would he," asked Cary sombrely--"would he agree? I think not. I am sure not. I think rather
that he cherishes this enmity, feeds it, and fans it. Our lines in life have crossed, and now
there is no force can lay them parallel. The sun is sinking, and I must see Major Edward again."

She rose from her seat beneath the cedar. "I'll hope on," she said. "Some day, if we live long
enough, all clouds will break. Time withstands even the stony heart."

"Do you think," he demanded, "that mine is a stony heart? Well, be it so, since this is a game
of misunderstanding! I will say this. If I could come, the next nineteenth of February, to
your house on Shockoe Hill, and find him there, and find you happy with him there, then, then
I think I would clasp hands--"

"Ah," she cried, "do not wait until February! We shall be there on Shockoe Hill in November."

He stooped and lifted her branch of ironweed. "You are sure?"

"Why, yes," she answered. "The house has been retaken. We go to Richmond as soon as Lewis comes
back from over the mountains."

"From--"

"He has bought land in the western part of the state. He is going on a journey soon to examine it."

"Toward the Ohio?"

"Yes; toward the Ohio. How did you know?"

"And you--you will not go with him?"

"He has talked of my going. But I cannot now that my aunt is ill."

"Perhaps he will wait?"

"Yes; he says that he will. How pale you are! I am sure you are not well?"

They had stepped from out the wood into the light of the garden. She looked at him with concern,
but be dismissed her question with a gesture of his hand and a laugh that sounded strangely
in her ears. "It is," he said, "the fading light. Are you going in now?"

"Not yet. Daphne is ill at the quarter, and I'll walk down to her cabin first. Do you stay
to supper?"

"No, not to-night. But I wish to see Major Edward again. If you'll allow me, I will go on to
the library."

"Certainly," answered Jacqueline, and, when he had kissed her hand and said good-bye, watched
him across the flower garden and up the steps that led to the glass doors. He passed into the
room, out of her sight, but she still stood there among the asters and the box. His look was
strange, she thought, and her hand had been crushed, rather than held, to his lips. She drew
her scarf about her; the September evening was falling chill. The sunset light struck full
upon the glass doors. She wondered why, for the second time in an afternoon, Ludwell Cary wished
to see Uncle Edward, there in the library. Only once or twice, in the fortnight that she had
been at Fontenoy, had she entered the library, and it was the room of all others that she loved.
She thought now of the old green chair and of her father's portrait, and of every loved and
dreamed-of detail, and she felt shut out in the dusk and chill. A sensation of strangeness
crept over her. She thought, "If I were dead and trying to make the living hear, I should feel
this way. And they would not even try to hear; they would shut the door and keep me out, all
alone in the dark."

She stood for a full minute staring at the panes and the red reflected glare of the sun, then
drew the scarf closer over her head, and took the path that led to the quarter.

CHAPTER XXII

MAJOR EDWARD

Rand rose from the supper-table and led the way into the dim, high-ceilinged room that served
him as study and library. "Bring the candles," he said over his shoulder, and Tom Mocket obediently
took up the heavy candelabra. With the clustered lights illuminating freckled face and sandy
hair, he followed his chief. "Don't you want me to start the fire?" he asked. "These October
nights are mortal cold."

"Yes," answered Rand. "Put a light to it and make the room bright. Fire is like a woman's presence."

As he spoke, he walked to the windows and drew the curtains, then took from his desk a number
of papers and began to lay them in an orderly row upon the table in the middle of the room.
"Mrs. Churchill is quite out of danger. My wife returns to Roselands to-morrow."

"That's fortunate," quoth Mocket, on his knees before the great fireplace. "You always did
cut things mighty close, Lewis, and I must say you are cutting this one close! Adam, he goes
along from day to day laughing and singing, with a face as smooth as an egg, but I'll warrant
he's watching the sun, the clock, and the hourglass!"

"I know--I know," said Rand. "The sun is travelling, and the clock is striking, and the sands
are running. This was a cursed check, this illness at Fontenoy. But for it I should be now
upon the Ohio." He left the table and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind him.
"Two weeks from here to this island--then eight weeks for that twelve hundred miles of river,
and to gather men from New Madrid and Baton Rouge and Bayou Pierre. October, November, December.
Say New Orleans by the New Year. There will be some seizing there,--the banks, the shipping.
If the army joins us, all will be well. But there, Tom, there! there is the 'if' in this project!"

"But you are sure of General Wilkinson!"

Rand paused to take a letter from his pocket. "Burr is. I have this to-day from him in cipher.
Listen!" He unfolded the paper, brought it into the firelight, and began to read in a clear,
low voice. "Burr has written to Wilkinson in substance as follows: Funds are obtained and operations
commenced. The eastern detachment will rendezvous on the Ohio the first of November. Everything
internal and external favours our views. The naval protection of England is secured. Final
orders are given to my friends and followers. It will be a host of choice spirits. Burr proceeds
westward never to return. With him go his daughter and grandson. Our project, my dear friend,
is brought to a point so long desired. Burr guarantees the result with his life and honour,
with the lives and honour and fortune of hundreds, the best blood of our country. Burr's plan
of operation is to move down rapidly from the falls on the fifteenth of November, with the
first five hundred or one thousand men, in light boats, now constructing for that purpose,
to be at Natchez between the fifth and fifteenth of December, there to meet Wilkinson, there
to determine whether it will be expedient in the first instance to seize on, or pass by, Baton
Rouge. The people of the country to which we are going are prepared to receive us; their agents,
now with Burr, say that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject them to a foreign
power, then in three weeks all will be settled. The gods invite us to glory and fortune; it
remains to be seen whether we deserve the boon.'"

Rand ceased to read and refolded the paper. "So Colonel Burr, with more to the same effect.
If he writes thus to General Wilkinson, he is undoubtedly very sure of that gentleman and of
the army which he commands. I am not of as confident a temper, and I am sure of no one save
Lewis Rand."

The other blew the flames beneath the pine knots. "There's Gaudylock."

"I except Gaudylock."

Tom rose from the brick hearth and dusted his knees. "And there's me."

Rand smiled down upon his old lieutenant. "Ah, yes, there's you, Tom,--you and Vinie! Well,
if we are fortunate, you shall come to me in the spring. By then we'll know if we are conquerors
and founders of empire, or if we're simply to be hanged as traitors. If the fairer lot is ours,
you shall have your island, my good old Panza!"

"And if it's the other?" demanded Tom, with a wry face.

Rand gave his characteristic short laugh. "It shall not be the other. The hemp is not planted
that shall trouble us. There are no more astrologers now that we are grown wise,--and still
a man trusts in his star! I trust in mine. Well, next week you'll open the office as usual,
and to all that come you'll state that I've gone, between courts, to look at a purchase of
land in Wood County. I'll bring that forgery case to an end day after to-morrow, and by Monday
Adam and I will be out of Albemarle."

Mocket drew a long breath. "Monday! That's soon, but the sooner, I reckon, the better. Sometimes
just any delay is fatal. For all his singing, I know that Adam is anxious--and he's weatherwise,
is Adam! There's something in the air. The papers have begun to talk, and everywhere you turn
there's the same damned curiosity about Aaron Burr and New Orleans and Mexico and the Washita
lands! Moreover, when a man's as quiet as Mr. Jefferson is just now, I suspect that man. Best
to get quite out of reach of a countermine. You've gone too far not to go a deal farther."

"Just so," agreed the other. "Many and many a league farther. Now, this paper of directions.
I'll go over it carefully with you, and then I'll burn it. First, as to Roselands, the stock,
and the servants. Joab and Isham go with us, starting on horseback an hour behind the chaise."

"You take no maid for Mrs. Rand?"

"It cannot be managed. When we reach this island, I can doubtless purchase a woman from Mr.
Blennerhassett."

"Mrs. Rand does not know yet, does she, Lewis?"

"She does not know. She will not know until we are over the mountains and return is impossible."
He turned from the fire, walked the room again, and spoke on as to himself. "When I tell her,
there will be my first battle, and the one battle that I dread! But I'll win it,--I'll win
because I must win. She will suffer at first, but I will make her forget,--I will love her
so that I will make her forget. If all goes well and greatness is in our horoscope, she shall
yet be friends with the crown upon her brow! Yes, and gracious friends with all that she has
left behind, and with her Virginian kindred! When all's won, and all's at peace, and the clash
and marvel an old tale, then shall her sister and her cousin visit her."

He paused at the fireplace and stirred the logs with his foot. "But that's a vision of the
morrow. Between now and then, and here and there, it never fails that there's an ambushed road."
He stood a moment, staring at the leaping flames, then returned to the table. "Back to business,
Tom! When Roselands is sold--"

"Do you know," suggested Tom, "I've been thinking that, now he is going to be married, a purchaser
might be found in Fairfax Cary."

"Fairfax Cary!" exclaimed the other, and drummed upon the table. "No; they will not want it,
those two. Poor old Tom! your intuitions are not very fine, are they?"

"Well, I just thought he might," said the underling. "But he may live on at Greenwood with
Ludwell Cary."

Rand struck his foot against the floor. "Don't let us speak that name to-night! I am weary
of it. It haunts me like a bell--Ludwell Cary! Ludwell Cary! And why it should haunt me, and
why the thought of him always, for one moment, palsies my will and my arm, I know no more than
you! When I shake the dust of this county from my feet, it shall go hard but I will shake this
obsession from my soul! Somewhere, when this world was but a fiery cloud, all the particles
of our being were whirled into collision. Well, enough of that! Whoever purchases Roselands,
it will not be a Cary. What's the matter now?"

"There's a horse coming up the drive."

Rand dropped the paper in his hand and sat listening. "Unlucky! I wanted no visitor to-night.
It may be but a messenger. Ring the bell, will you, for Joab."

The horse came on and stopped before the great doorstone. There was the sound of some one dismounting,
Joab speaking, and then the voice of the horseman. Rand started violently. "Are we awake?"
he said, rising. "That is Major Churchill's voice."

Joab appeared at the door. "Marse Lewis, Marse Edward Churchill say kin he trouble you fer
a few minutes' conversation? He say he lak ter see you alone--"

"One moment, Joab," said the master, gathering the papers from the table as he spoke. "Tom,
you'll go back to the dining-room and wait for me there. No; not by that door--there's no use
in his meeting you. What imaginable thing has brought him here?" He replaced the papers in
a drawer, closed and locked it, looked up to see that Mocket was gone, and spoke to the negro.
"Show Major Churchill in here."

The Major entered, dry, withered, his empty sleeve pinned to the front of his riding-coat.
"Mr. Rand, good-evening. Ha, a cheerful fire against a frosty night! I come in out of the cold
to a blaze like that, sir, and straightway, by a trick of the mind that never fails, I am back
at Valley Forge!"

Rand looked at him keenly. "Permit me to hope, sir, that there is nothing wrong at Fontenoy?
My wife is well?"

"Fontenoy is much as usual, sir," answered his visitor, "and my niece is very well. It is natural
that my appearance here should cause surprise."

Rand pushed forward a great chair. "Yes, I am surprised," he said, with a smile. "Very much
surprised. But since you bring no bad news, I am also glad. Won't you sit, sir? You are welcome
to Roselands."

Major Edward took the edge of the chair, and held out his long, thin fingers to the blaze.
"Yes; Valley Forge," he repeated, with his dry deliberation. "Valley Forge--and starving soldiers
moaning through the icy night! Washington rarely slept; he sat there in his tent, planning,
planning, in the cold, by the dim light. There was a war--and there were brave men--and there
was a patriot soul!"

"I learn from Jacqueline that Colonel Churchill and you too, sir, have shown her for some days
past much kindness, tenderness, and consideration. She has been made happy thereby."

"My niece has never been other than dear to me, sir," said the Major, and still warmed his
hand. "I believe, Mr. Rand, that your father fought bravely in the war?"

"He did his part, sir. He was a scout with General Campbell and, I have heard, fought like
a berserker at King's Mountain."

"If he did his part," the Major replied, "he did well, and is to be reckoned among the patres
patriæ. It is a good inheritance to derive from a patriot father."

"So I have read, sir," said Rand dryly.

There was a silence while the flames leaped and roared. The Major broke it. "You would take
me, would you not, Mr. Rand, to be a man of my word?"

"I should, sir."

"It has been my reputation. The last time that I spoke to you--"

Rand smiled gravely. "That was two years and a half ago, and your speech was to the effect
that never should you speak to me again. Well! opinion and will have their mutations. Men of
their word, Major Churchill, know better than most how little worth are the words of men. However
you come here to-night, pray believe that you are welcome, and that I would gladly be friends."

Major Edward drew a long breath, pushed back his chair somewhat from the warmth of the fire,
and from under shaggy brows regarded his nephew-in-law with the eyes of an old eagle, sombre
and fierce. "Be so good, then, as to conceive that I come with an olive branch."

"It is difficult," said Rand, after a pause and with a smile, "to conceive that, but if it
be true, sir, then hail to the olive! This feud was not of my seeking." He leaned forward from
his chair and held out his hand. "Ever since the days of the blue room and that deep draught
of Fontenoy kindness, a light has dwelt for me over the place. Will you not shake hands, sir?"

The other made an irresolute movement, then drew back. "Let us wait a little," he exclaimed
harshly. "Perhaps I will, sir, in the end, perhaps I will! It is in the hope that eventually
we will strike hands that I sit here. But such signs of amity come with better grace at the
battle's end--" He paused and glared at the fire.

"There is, then, to be a battle?"

The Major swung around from the red light of the logs. "Mr. Rand, we--my brother Dick and I--propose
a lasting peace between the two houses, between Fontenoy and Roselands. My brother Henry, sir,
the father of--of your wife, sir, was as near to us in love as in blood, and the honour, safety,
and peace of mind of his daughter are very much our concern! You will say that by perseverance
in this long estrangement we have ignored the last of these. Perhaps, sir, perhaps! Old men
are obstinate, and their wounds do not heal like those of youth. Enough of that! We--my brother
Dick and I--are prepared to let bygones be bygones. We have cudgelled our brains--I mean, we
have talked matters over. We are prepared, Mr. Rand, to meet you halfway--"

"Thank you," said Rand. "On what specific proposition?"

Major Edward rose, took a short turn in the room, and came back to his chair. "Mr. Rand, in
the matter of the nomination for Governor, is it too late to recall your refusal? I think not,
sir. Your party has named no other candidate. As a Federalist, I know, sir, but little of that
party's inner working, but I am told that you would sweep the state. Far be it from me to say
that I wish to see a Democrat-Republican Governor of Virginia! I do not. But since the gentleman
for whom I myself, sir, shall vote, is undoubtedly destined to defeat, we--my brother Dick
and I--consider that that post may as well be filled by you, sir, as by any other of your Jacobinical
party. No one doubts your ability--you are diabolically able! But, sir, I would bury this arm
where a damned cutthroat barber surgeon buried the other before I would cry on to such a post
any man who did not enter the race with heart and hands washed clean of all but honour, plain
intents, and loyalty! In the past he may have been tempted--he may have listened to the charmer,
charming never so wisely--there is in man an iron capacity for going wrong. He may have done
this, planned that--I know not; we all err. It is not too late; he may yet put behind him all
this--"

"I do not think that I understand," said Rand. "All what, sir?"

The Major faced around from the fire with a jerk. "All this. I am explicit, sir. All this."

"Ah!" answered Rand. "I am dull, I suppose. All this. Well, sir?"

"I should," continued the Major, with emphasis, "regard the acceptance of the nomination as
proof positive of the laying aside of all conflicting ideas, uneasy dreams, and fallacious
reasoning, of all intents and purposes that might war with a sober and honourable discharge
of exalted public duties. They are exalted, sir, and they may be so highly discharged, so ably
and so loftily, as to infinitely dignify the office that has already great traditions. A Governor
of Virginia may be the theme, sir, of many a far distant panegyric--"

Again he rose and stalked across the room, then, returning to the hearth, stood before Rand,
his high, thin features somewhat flushed and his deep old eyes alight. "Mr. Rand, it would
be idle to deny to you that I have had for you both dislike and mistrust. You may, if you choose,
even strengthen these terms and say that I have regarded you with hatred and contempt. I am
a man of strong feelings, sir, and you outraged them--you outraged them! Well, I am prepared
to bury all that. Become a great Governor of Virginia, serve your land truly, according to
the lights vouchsafed to a Republican, and, though we may not vote for you, sir, yet we--my
brother Dick and I--we will watch your career with interest--yes, damn me, sir! with interest,
pride, and affection!" He broke off to stare moodily into the fire and, with his foot, to thrust
farther in a burning log.

"An olive branch!" exclaimed Rand, smiling. "This is a whole grove of olives! I am sorry about
the governorship--"

"I have made enquiries," interrupted the other harshly. "You have but to signify your change
of mind to your committee, and your name is up. The governorship--the governorship is not all!
It is but a step from Richmond to Washington. There's field enough for even a towering ambition."
He looked around him. "And Roselands. This place has always had a charm. In the old days it
was famed for hospitality--for hospitality and for the beauty of its women."

"In neither respect, sir, has it lost its reputation."

Major Edward made a gesture of acquiescence. "I dare say not, sir, I dare say not. I am told
that Republicans flock here. And Jacqueline is a beautiful woman. Well, sir, why should not
pilgrimages be made to Roselands as to Monticello? You have begun to improve it. Continue,
and make the place a Garden of Eden, a Farm of Cincinnatus, a--a--what you will! Dick thinks
that you may not be in funds to plant and build as you desire. If that is so, sir, either he
or I might with ease accommodate you--" He paused.

"I take your offer as it is meant," said Rand, "and thank you both. But my affairs are in order,
and I am not straitened for money."

The Major made a courteous gesture. "It was but a supposition. Well, Mr. Rand, why not? Why
not make the picture real that we are painting? Eminent in public affairs--eminent in the law--ay,
there, sir, I will praise you unreservedly. You are a great lawyer--worshipped by your party
and in the line of succession to its highest gift, fixed in your state and county and happy
in your home, rounding out your life with all that makes life worthy to be lived,--

     "Honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.

"Is not the picture fair enough, sir? There is in it no mirage, no Fata Morgana, no marsh fire.
You are a man of great abilities, with ample power to direct those inner forces to outward
ends that shall truly gild your name. Truly, sir, not falsely. Gold, not pinchbeck. Clear glory
of duty highly done, not a cloudy fame whose wings are drenched with blood and tears. Come,
sir, come--make an old man happy!" He dragged his chair nearer to Rand and held out his hand.

"I cannot accept the nomination for Governor, sir," said Rand. "There are various considerations
which put it out of the question. I cannot go into these with you. You must take it from me
that it is impossible."

The Major drew back. "That is final, sir?"

"That is final."

There was a silence. Rand sat, chin in hand, thoughtfully regarding his visitor. Major Churchill,
erect, rigid, grey, and arid, stared before him as though indeed he saw only snowy plains,
fallen men, and a forlorn hope. At last he spoke in a dry and difficult voice. "You persevere
in your intention of returning to Richmond and to your house on Shockoe Hill in November?"

"It is my plan, sir, to go to Richmond in November."

"Immediately upon your return from over the mountains?"

Rand shot a glance at his interlocutor. "Immediately."

"These lands that you are going to see, sir--they are not as far as the Washita?"

"No; they are not as far as the Washita." Rand sat upright and let his hand fall heavily upon
the arm of his chair. "That is a curious question, Major Churchill."

"Do you find it so?" asked the Major grimly. "I should, were it asked of me--so damned strange
a question that it would not pass without challenge! But then, I am not declining governorships
nor travelling West."

Rand rose from his chair. "Major Churchill"--He stopped short, bit his lip, and walked away
to the window. There he drew the curtain slightly aside and stood with brow pressed against
a pane, gazing out into the frosty darkness. A half moon just lifted the wide landscape out
of shadow, and from the interlacing boughs of trees the coloured leaves were falling. Rand
looked at the distant mountains, but the eye of his mind travelled farther yet and saw all
the country beyond, all the land of the To Be, all the giant valley of the Mississippi, all
the rolling, endless plains, all Mexico with snowy peaks and mines of gold. The apparition
did not come dazzlingly. He was no visionary. He weighed and measured and reckoned carefully
with his host. But there, beyond the mountains, lay no small part of the habitable world,--and
the race of conquerors had not died with Alexander or Cæsar, Cortez or Pizarro! Witness Marengo
and Austerlitz and that throne at Fontainebleau! He dropped the curtain from his hand and turned
to the firelit room and to the tense grey figure on the hearth. "Major Churchill, if, softened
by Jacqueline's presence there at Fontenoy, you came to-night to Roselands with the simple
purpose of making friends with the man she loves, then, sir, that man would be a heartless
churl indeed if he were not touched and gratified, and did not accept with eagerness such an
overture. But, sir, but! There is more, I think, in your visit to-night than meets the eye.
You demand that I shall become my party's candidate for the governorship. I answer it is not
now possible. You insist that I shall busy myself with improvements here at Roselands, and
to that end you offer to reinforce my purse. I answer that Roselands does very well, and that
I am not in need of money. You preach to me patriotism and refer to General Washington; you
speak poetically of gold versus pinchbeck, and true glory versus fame with drenched wings;
you ask me certain questions in a voice that has hardly the ring of friendship--and last but
not least you wish to know if a parcel of land that I have bought over the mountains is situate
upon the Washita! The Washita, Major Churchill, is on the far side of the Mississippi, in Spanish
Territory. May I ask, sir, before I withdraw my welcome to Roselands, by what right you are
entitled to put such a question to me, and what is, indeed, the purport of your visit here
to-night?"

Major Edward Churchill rose, stark and grey, with narrowed eyes and deliberating, pointing
hand. "You are a villain, sir; yes, sir, a damned, skilled, heart-breaking villain! Bold! yes,
you are bold--bold as others of your tribe of whom the mythologies tell! Arrogant as Lucifer,
you are more wretched than the slave in your fields! You might have been upon the side of light;
you have chosen darkness. It will swallow you up, and I, for one, shall say, 'The night hath
its own.' You have chosen wrongly where you might have chosen rightly, and you have not done
so in blind passion but in cold blood, fully and freely, under whatever monstrous light it
is by which you think you walk! I have warned you of the gulf, and I have warned in vain. So
be it! But do not think, sir, do not think that you will be allowed to drag with you, down
into the darkness, the woman whom you have married! I wish that my niece had died before she
saw your face! Do you know what she thinks you, sir? She thinks you a lover so devoted that
at her pleading you put forever from you a gilded lure; a gentleman so absolutely of your word
that for her to doubt it would be the blackest treason; a statesman and a patriot who will
yet nobly serve Virginia and the country! God knows what she doesn't think you--the misguided
child! She's happy to-night, at Fontenoy, because she's coming home to you to-morrow. That
I should have lived to say such a thing of Henry Churchill's daughter! When I rode away to-night,
she was singing." He burst into spasmodic and grating laughter. "It was that song of Lovelace's!
By God, sir, she must have had you in mind.

     "I could not love thee, dear, so much,
       Loved I not honour more.

"Yes, by God, she was thinking of you! Ha ha, ha ha!"

"You are an old man," said Rand. "It is well for you that you are. I wish to know who is responsible
for these conjectures, suspicions, charges--whatever term you choose, sir, for all are alike
indifferent to me--which brought you here to-night? Who, sir, is the principal in this affair?
You are an old man, and you are my wife's kinsman; doubly are you behind cover; but who, who,
Major Churchill, set you on to speak of towering ambition and blood-drenched wings and broken
vows and deceived innocence, and all the rest of this night's farrago? Who, I say--who?"

"Ask on, sir," answered the Major grimly. "There is no law against asking, as there is none
to compel an answer. Sir, I am about to remove myself from a house that I shall not trouble
again, and I have but three words to say before I bid you good-night. I warn you not to proceed
with your Luciferian schemes, whatever they may be, sir, whatever they may be! I warn you that
it is ill travelling over the mountains at this season of the year, and I solemnly protest
to you that my niece shall not travel with you!"

"And who," asked Rand calmly,--"and who will prevent that?"

"Sir," answered the other, "a grain of sand or a blade of grass, if rightly placed." He shook
his long forefinger at the younger man. "You have been fortunate for a long turn in the game,
Lewis Rand, and you have grown to think the revolving earth but a pin-wheel for your turning.
You will awake some day, and since there is that in you which charity might call perverted
greatness, I think that you will suffer when you awake. In which hope, sir, I take my leave.
Mr. Rand, I have the honour to bid you a very good-night."

The master of Roselands rang the bell. "Good-night, Major Churchill. I am sorry that we part
no better friends, and I regret that you will not tell me what gatherer up of rumour and discoverer
of mares' nests was at the pains to procure me the honour of this visit. I might hazard a guess--but
no matter. Joab, Major Churchill's horse. Good-night, sir."

He bowed formally. Major Churchill stood for a moment looking straight before him with a somewhat
glassy stare, then, "Good-night, Mr. Rand," he said, in a voice like a wind through November
reeds, made a bow as low and as studied as that with which he had once honoured Rand in the
Fontenoy drawing-room, turned with martial precision, and stalked from the room.

Lewis Rand stood long upon the hearth, staring down into the fire. He heard Major Edward's
horse go down the drive and out upon the highroad with a swiftness that spoke of a rider in
a passion. The sound of hoofs died away, and he still stood looking into the red hollows, but
at last with a short and angry laugh he turned away and opened the door which led to the dining-room.
"Are you still there, Tom? Come in, man! The accusing angel has gone."

Tom appeared, and the two went back to the great table in the centre of the room. Rand unlocked
the drawer and took out the papers in the perusal of which they had been interrupted. Mocket
snuffed the candles and tossed another log of hickory upon the fire. "It falls in with what
Gaudylock suspected," said Rand's measured voice behind him, "and it all dates back to the
nineteenth of February. When he left the house that night, he must have known--"

"Of whom are you talking?" asked Tom at the fire. "Major Edward?"

"No, not Major Edward. And now he is using his knowledge. She told me to-day that he was often
at Fontenoy. Too often, too often, Ludwell Cary!"

"Now, after stopping my mouth, you have spoken his name yourself!" remarked Tom. "You and he
are over against each other in that case to-morrow, aren't you?"

"In every case we are over against each other," said the other abruptly. "And we shall be so
until Judgment Day. Come, man, come! we have all these to go through with before cockcrow."

CHAPTER XXIII

A CHALLENGE

The Charlottesville Robbery Case was one of no great importance save to those directly concerned.
It had to do with a forged note, a robbery by night, and an absconding trusted clerk of a company
of British Merchants. When the case came up for trial on this October day, the Court House
was well filled indeed, but rather on account of the lawyers engaged than because of the matter's
intrinsic interest. The British Merchants had retained Mr. Ludwell Cary. The side of the prisoner,
mentioning that fact in a pitiful scrawl addressed to the law office of Messrs. Rand and Mocket,
found to its somewhat pathetic surprise that Mr. Rand himself would take the case and oppose
Mr. Cary.

The two had fought it with a determination apparent to every bystander, and now, on the last
day of the trial, the counsel for the prosecution rose to sum up his case. He was listened
to with attention, and his speech was effective. The theme was the individual who, after forgery
and embezzlement, had taken French leave, quitting a post of trust and credit for regions where
he hoped to enjoy his ill-gotten gains in peace and quietness. The regions had proved inhospitable,
and a sheriff had escorted the unlucky adventurer with that which was not his own back to the
spot whence he had started. His transgression was now to be traced from the moment--day or
night, or sunrise or sunset; what mattered the moment?--when the thought passed through his
brain, "Why should I plod on like other men?"

"'Passed through,' did I say?--nay, it tarried; at first like a visitor who will one day take
his leave, then a cherished inmate, and at last lord and master of every crevice of that petty
mansion! It dwelled there, and day by day it fed itself with remembered examples. 'There was
Tom, over on the Eastern Shore, grew tired, too, of working for his employers,--and he robbed
the till one night, and got off on a sloop to the Havana, and now they say he has a pirate
ship of his very own! And Dick. Dick got tired, too, in a tan-yard in Alexandria, and when
his master sent him on a mission to Washington, he took his foot in his hand and went farther.
He had his expenses in his pocket, so why not? He's prospering now in a bigger and gayer town
than Alexandria! And Harry. Harry was more trusted than them all, but he, too, got tired--in
a warehouse at Rocket's--of plod, plod, plod! serve, serve, serve! So he forged a name, and
took the gold that lay beneath his hand, tore up his indentures, and fled in the night-time--over
the hills and far away! He's a rich man now, somewhere near the sunset, rich and great, with
clerks of his own. He had the advantage of education, had Harry! Examples! Examples thick as
hops! What's Buonaparte himself but a poor Corsican lieutenant that stole an empire? I'll be
bold, too. I'll steal, and then I'll steal away!'

"So scullion soul to pliant body. His thought is father to his deed, and there is the usual
resemblance between son and parent. What matters it that he has lived in his employer's house,
and has found him no Egyptian taskmaster, but a benefactor, lavish of favours? What matters
it that he has in charge things of trust and moment which, by miscarrying, will work distress
to many? What matters it that others are about him, engaged in this same drudgery of doing
one's duty, to whom, should he succeed in villainy as he trusts to do, his example will remain,
a wrecker's light to entice the storm-tossed upon a rocky shore? What matters it,--I am told,
gentlemen, that the prisoner has a good and industrious sister,--what matters it that rarely,
rarely, is there ill-doing without, somewhere in the shadowed background, some bruised and
broken heart? What does it matter that he betrays his trust, breaks his oath, blackens his
name, slurs his friends, and recruits the army, wan and sinister, of all the fallen since time
began? To him, apparently, it matters less than a drifting leaf in the wind of this October
day. He remembers all that he should forget, and forgets all that should be remembered. There
pass by him in long parade Tom and Dick and Harry and others of their ilk. He sees them, and
he sees little else. It is a host of choice spirits, and they have banners flying. His courage
mounts. Brave emulation! noble rivalry! He, too, will be bold; he, too, will join their regiment!
For him, too, the spoils of opportunity and a daughter of the game! He feels the summer in
the air, and all Brummagem rises upon his horizon. Farewell to patient drudgery and the slow
playing over of the tune of life! He's for a brisker air, he's for 'Over the hills and far away.'

"His little plans are laid. I say 'little,' gentlemen, advisedly, for in all this there is
no greatness. We speak of a self-seeker here, and all the ends of such an one are small, and
he himself has not attained the full stature of a man. The ambitious soul before us! By stealth
he practises until he can sign his employer's name, more lifelike almost than life! By stealth
he gains impressions of the keys. By stealth he eyes the only wealth that his mole mind can
value! By stealth he makes his preparations, and by stealth he cons the miles and the post-houses
between him and the country to which he means to carry himself and his stolen goods! He is
assiduous at his desk; his employers nod approval, praise him for a lad of parts, and hold
him up for emulation. In his brain one air continues,--'Over the hills and far away.'

"The day approaches. The forgery is done, the accustomed hand slips easily in and out of the
golden drawer, and all the roads are got by heart. We have the loan of a horse--before another
dawn we will be gone. O Fortune of great thieves, stand pat! and kindly tune run on! 'Over
the hills and far away.'

"We have been told by the worthy gentlemen, his employers, that so trustworthy did they consider
the prisoner at the bar, so able in their affairs and assiduous in their service, that this
very day it was in their minds to increase his pay and to raise him quite above his fellow
clerks to an honourable post indeed. He did not give them time, gentlemen, he did not give
them time! The hour is here, the notes are sewn within the lining of our well-brushed riding-coat,
the master key is in our itching palm! We'll lurk until midnight, then in the dark room we
will unlock the drawer. If we are heard, softly as we step in the silence of the night--if
a watchman come--the worse for the watchman! We carry pistols, and the butt of one against
his forehead will do the work. For we are bold, gentlemen, we are as bold as Cæsar or Buonaparte!
We won't be stopped--we won't! We're for 'Over the hills and far away.'"

The counsel for the prisoner addressed the Judge. "Your Honour, no watchman, dead or alive,
being among the witnesses, and there being no capable proof of what were or were not my client's
thoughts upon the night in question, I indignantly protest--"

The objection was sustained. The interruption over, the attorney for the British Merchants
went evenly on. "We have Mr. Rand's word for it that the prisoner had no thought of the watchman,
and no intention of using, even in case of need, the weapons with which it has been proved
he was provided. Mr. Rand must know. As a rule, gentlemen bearing arms about their persons
may be considered the potential users of said arms, whether the antiquated rapier or the modern
pistol--but then, I bethink me, we are not speaking of men of honour. We are speaking of a
small criminal in a small way, and Mr. Rand assures us that his thoughts matched his estate--they
were humble, they were creeping. Headstrong, proud, and bold are words too swelling for this
low and narrow case. To wear a weapon with intent to use is one thing, to buckle it on as a
mere trivial, harmless, modish ornament and gewgaw is quite another! We have Mr. Rand's word
for it that it was so worn. Gentlemen, the prisoner, armed, indeed, as has been proved, was
absolutely innocent of even the remotest intent to use under any provocation beneath high heaven
the pistols--oiled, primed, and duelling type--with which, by chance or for the merest whim
of ornament, he had decked his person upon this eventful night. Mr. Rand tells us so, and doubtless
he knows whereof he speaks.

"So armed and so harmless, gentlemen, the prisoner, having committed forgery, does now his
second crime--the pitiful robbery. The key that he has forged with care is true to him, the
gold lies at his mercy, underneath his hand; he lifts it up, the shining thing; he bears it
away. The hour has struck, the deed is done; irrevocable, it takes its place upon the inexpugnable
record. He has stolen, and there is no power in heaven or earth to change that little fact.
We are grown squeamish in these modern days, and no longer brand a thief with heated iron.
No letter will appear, seared on his shoulder or his hand, but is he less the thief for that?
He himself has done the branding, and Eternity cannot wear out the mark. He goes. With his
stolen gold he steals away. It is night. There are only the stars to watch his flight, and
he cares not for the stars--they never tell. Have they not, time out of mind, stood the friend
of all gentlemen of the road? He quits the house that has seen his crime; he leaves dull and
honest men asleep; he bestows no parting glance upon the dim, familiar ways. His native land
is naught--he's for green fields and pastures new--he's for Tom and Dick and Harry, and all
their goodly company--he's for 'Over the hills and far away.'"

The counsel for the prosecution finished his speech. The judge summed up the case, the jury
retired, and very shortly returned with the expected verdict of Guilty. The chalk-white and
shaking prisoner stood up, was sentenced and removed, and, the business of the day being over,
the court adjourned.

Good-naturedly, laughing and talking after the morning's restraint, the crowd, gentle and simple,
from the lower part of the room, was in the course of jostling toward the door, when there
came a sudden check coupled with exclamations from those nearest the bar, and with a general
turning of heads and bodies in that direction.

The lawyer for the prosecution and the lawyer for the defence stood opposed, a yard of court-room
floor between them, and around them a ring of excited friends and acquaintances. There had
been high voices, but now a silence fell, and the throng held its breath in cheerful expectation
of the bursting of a long predicted storm.

"This," said Cary's clear and even voice, not raised, but smoothly distinct,--"this is a challenge,
sir. I take it rightly, Mr. Rand?"

"You take it rightly, Mr. Cary. I shall presently send a friend to wait upon you."

"He will find me, sir, at the Swan. As the challenged party, it is my prerogative to name hour
and place. You shall shortly be advised of both."

"I am going to my office, sir, where I will await your messenger. You cannot name an hour too
soon, a place too near for me."

"Of that I am aware, Mr. Rand. I will make no delay that I conceive to be unnecessary. I am,
sir, your very humble servant."

"I am yours, Mr. Cary."

The two bowed profoundly and parted company, making their several ways through the throng to
the Swan and to the office with the green door. With them went their immediate friends and
backers. The crowd of spectators, talking loud or talking low, conjecturing, explaining, and
laying down the law, jesting, disputing, hotly partisan, and on the whole very agreeably excited,
finally got itself out of the Court House and the Court-House yard, and the autumn stillness
settled down upon the place.

At Roselands, in the late afternoon, Jacqueline came out upon the doorstone and sat there,
listening for Selim's hoofs upon the road. The weather was Indian summer, balmy, mild, and
blue with haze. On the great ring of grass before the stone yellow beech leaves were lying
thick, and the grey limbs of the gigantic, solitary tree rose bare against the blue. Jacqueline
sat with her chin in her hand, watching the mountains, more visible now that the leaves were
gone. She saw the cleft through which ran the western road, and she thought with pleasure of
the days before her. She loved the journeys to Richmond, and this one would be more beautiful,
and new. They would be gone ten days, perhaps,--ten days of slow, bright travel through sumptuous
woods, of talk close and dear. She was exquisitely happy as she sat there with her eyes upon
the Blue Ridge. The last fortnight of her stay at Fontenoy had been almost a blissful time.
Her uncles changed, and no longer passed her with averted eyes, or, when they spoke, used so
cold a ceremony as to chill her heart. They grew almost natural, they seemed even tender of
her. Uncle Dick had once again called her "My little Jack," though he groaned immediately afterwards
and, getting up, looked out of the window, and Uncle Edward left the library door ajar. Jacqueline
laid her head upon her arm and laughed. It was coming right--it was coming right!--and next
year they would all dance at Fontenoy with light hearts, at Unity's wedding. It had begun to
come right the evening of the day that she had met Ludwell Cary in the cedar wood. She wondered,
slightly, at that coincidence, and then she fell again to dreaming.

Lewis was coming; he had passed through the gate--and she started up. Its most striking advances
have been along mechanical, scientific, and commercial lines. As a result of this material
progress the general conditions of mankind in civilized countries have undoubtedly been greatly
bettered. Popular education and the printing-press have also raised the intellectual level
of society, making learning the privilege of even the poorest. Intellectual, scientific, and
commercial pursuits have thus largely absorbed those energies which in other ages found exercise
in the creation of artistic forms and objects.

The critical and sceptical spirit, the spirit of utilitarianism and realism, has checked the free and
general development of the creative imagination, at least in the
plastic arts.

While in poetry and music there have been great and noble achievements,
the plastic arts, including architecture, have only of late years
attained a position at all worthy of the intellectual advancement
of the times.

Nevertheless the artistic spirit has never been wholly crushed out by the untoward pressure
of realism and commercialism.

Unfortunately it has repeatedly been directed in wrong channels.

Modern archæology and the publication of the forms of historic art by books and photographs
have too exclusively fastened attention upon the details of extinct styles as a source of inspiration
in design.

The whole range of historic art is brought within our survey, and
while this has on the one hand tended toward the confusion and multiplication
of styles in modern work, it has on the other led to a slavish adherence
to historic precedent or a literal copying of historic forms.

Modern architecture has thus oscillated between the extremes of archæological
servitude and of an unreasoning eclecticism.

In the hands of men of inferior training the results have been deplorable travesties of all
styles, or meaningless aggregations of ill-assorted forms.

An important factor in this demoralization of architectural design has been the development of
new constructive methods, especially in the use of iron and steel. It has been impossible for
modern designers, in their treatment of style, to keep pace with the rapid changes in the structural
use of metal in architecture. The roofs of vast span, largely composed of glass, which modern
methods of trussing have made possible for railway stations, armories, and exhibition buildings;
the immense unencumbered spaces which may be covered by them; the introduction and development,
especially in the United States, of the post-and-girder system of construction for high buildings,
in which the external walls are a mere screen or filling-in; these
have revolutionized architecture so rapidly and completely that architects
are still struggling and groping to find the solution of many of the
problems of style, scale, and composition which they have brought
forward.

Within the last thirty years, however, architecture has, despite these new conditions, made
notable advances. The artistic emulation of repeated international exhibitions, the multiplication
of museums and schools of art, the general advance in intelligence and enlightenment, have all
contributed to this artistic progress. There appears to be more of the artistic and intellectual
quality in the average architecture of the present time, on both sides of the Atlantic, than
at any previous period in this century. The futility of the archæological revival of extinct
styles is generally recognized.

New conditions are gradually procuring the solution of the very problems they raise. Historic
precedent sits more lightly on the architect than formerly, and the essential unity of principle
underlying all good design is coming to be better understood.[26]

[Footnote 26: See Appendix D.]

+FRANCE.+ It is in France, Germany (including Austria), and England that the architectural progress
of this period in Europe has been most marked. We have already noticed the results of the classic
revivals in these three countries. Speaking broadly, it may be said that in France the influence
of the École des Beaux-Arts, while it has tended to give greater unity and consistency to the
national architecture, and has exerted a powerful influence in behalf of refinement of taste and
correctness of style, has also stood in the way of a free development
of new ideas.

French architecture has throughout adhered to the principles of the Renaissance, though the style
has during this century been modified by various influences. The first of these was the Néo-Grec
movement, alluded to in the last chapter, which broke the grip of Roman tradition in matters
of detail and gave greater elasticity to the national style. Next should be mentioned the Gothic movement
represented by Viollet-le-Duc, Lassus, Ballu, and their followers. Beginning about 1845, it produced
comparatively few notable buildings, but gave a great impulse to the study of mediæval archæology
and the restoration of mediæval monuments. The churches of Ste. Clothilde and of St. Jean de Belleville,
at Paris, and the reconstruction of the Château de Pierrefonds, were among its direct results.
Indirectly it led to a freer and more rational treatment of constructive forms and materials
than had prevailed with the academic designers.

The church of +St. Augustin+, by Baltard, at Paris, illustrates this in its use of iron and
brick for the dome and vaulting, and the +College Chaptal+, by E. Train, in its decorative treatment
of brick and tile externally. The general adoption of iron for roof-trusses and for the construction
of markets and similar buildings tended further in the same direction, the +Halles Centrales+
at Paris, by Baltard, being a notable example.

+THE SECOND EMPIRE.+ The reign of Napoleon III. (1852-70) was a period
of exceptional activity, especially in Paris.

The greatest monument of his reign was the completion of the +Louvre+
and +Tuileries+, under Visconti and Lefuel, including the remodelling
of the pavilions de Flore and de Marsan.

The new portions constitute the most notable example of modern French architecture, and the manner
in which the two palaces were united deserves high praise. In spite of certain defects, this
work is marked by a combination of dignity, richness, and refinement, such as are rarely found
in palace architecture (Figs. 208, 209). The +New Opera+ (1863-75), by Garnier (d.  1898),
stands next to the Louvre in importance as a national monument.

It is by far the most sumptuous building for amusement in existence, but in purity of detail
and in the balance and restraint of its design it is inferior to the work of Visconti and
Lefuel (Fig. 210).

To this reign belong the Palais de l’Industrie, by Viel, built for the exhibition of 1855, and
several great railway stations (Gare du Nord, by Hitorff, Gare de l’Est, Gare d’Orléans, etc.),
in which the modern French version of the Renaissance was applied with considerable skill to
buildings largely constructed of iron and glass.

Town halls and theatres were erected in great numbers, and in decorative
works like fountains and monuments the French were particularly successful.

The fountains of +St. Michel+, Cuvier, and Molière, at Paris, and of +Longchamps+, at Marseilles
(Fig. 211), illustrate the fertility of resource and elegance of detailed treatment of the French
in this department. Mention should also here be made of the extensive enterprises carried out
by Napoleon III., in rectifying and embellishing the street-plan of Paris by new avenues and
squares on a vast scale, adding greatly to the monumental splendor
of the city.

+THE REPUBLIC.+ Since the disasters of 1870 a number of important structures have been erected,
and French architecture has shown a remarkable vitality and flexibility under new conditions.
Its productions have in general been marked by a refined taste and
a conspicuous absence of eccentricity and excess; but it has for the
most part trodden in well-worn paths.

The most notable recent monuments are, in church architecture, the
+Sacré-Cœur+, at Montmartre, by Abadie, a votive church inspired from
the Franco-Byzantine style of Aquitania; in civil architecture the
new +Hôtel de Ville+, at Paris, by Ballu and Déperthes, recalling
the original structure destroyed by the Commune, but in reality an
original creation of great merit; in scholastic architecture the new
École de Médecine, and the new +Sorbonne+, by Nénot, and in other
branches of the art the metal-and-glass exhibition buildings of 1878,
1889, and 1900.

In the last of these the striving for originality and the effort
to discard traditional forms reached the extreme, although accompanied
by much very clever detail and a masterly use of color-decoration.

To these should be added many noteworthy theatres, town-halls, court-houses, and préfectures
in provincial cities, and commemorative columns and monuments almost without number. In street
architecture there is now much more variety and originality than formerly, especially in private
houses, and the reaction against the orders and against traditional methods of design has of late
been growing stronger. The chief excellence of modern French architecture lies in its rational
planning, monumental spirit, and refinement of detail (Fig. 212).

+GERMANY AND AUSTRIA.+ German architecture has been more affected
during the past fifty years by the archæological spirit than has the
French.

A pronounced mediæval revival partly accompanied, partly followed the Greek revival in Germany,
and produced a number of churches and a few secular buildings in the basilican, Romanesque,
and Gothic styles.These are less interesting than those in the Greek style, because mediæval
forms are even more foreign to modern needs than the classic, being compatible only with systems
of design and construction which are no longer practicable.

At Munich the Auekirche, by Ohlmuller, in an attenuated Gothic style; the Byzantine Ludwigskirche,
and Ziebland’s Basilica following Early Christian models; the Basilica by Hübsch , at Bulach, and the
Votive Church at Vienna (1856) by H. Von Ferstel (1828-1883) are notable neo-mediæval monuments.
The last-named church may be classed with Ste. Clothilde at Paris (see p. 371), and St. Patrick’s
Cathedral at New York, all three being of approximately the same
size and general style, recalling St. Ouen at Rouen.

They are correct and elaborate, but more or less cold and artificial.

More successful are many of the German theatres and concert halls,
in which Renaissance and classic forms have been freely used.

In several of these the attempt has been made to express by the external form the curvilinear
plan of the auditorium, as in the +Dresden Theatre+, by Semper (1841; Fig. 213), the theatre
at Carlsruhe, by Hübsch, and the double winter-summer +Victoria Theatre+, at Berlin, by Titz.
But the practical and æsthetic difficulties involved in this treatment
have caused its general abandonment.

The +Opera House+ at Vienna, by Siccardsburg and Van der Null (1861-69),
is rectangular in its masses, and but for a certain triviality of
detail would rank among the most successful buildings of its kind.

The new +Burgtheater+ in the same city is a more elaborately ornate
structure in Renaissance style, somewhat florid and overdone.

Modern German architecture is at its best in academic and residential buildings. The +Bauschule+,
at Berlin, by Schinkel, in which brick is used in a rational and dignified design without
the orders; the Polytechnic School, at Zürich, by Semper; university
buildings, and especially buildings for technical instruction, at
Carlsruhe, Stuttgart, Strasburg, Vienna, and other cities, show a
monumental treatment of the exterior and of the general distribution,
combined with a careful study of practical requirements.

In administrative buildings the Germans have hardly been as successful; and the new +Parliament
House+, at Berlin, by Wallot, in spite of its splendor and costliness, is heavy and unsatisfactory
in detail. The larger cities, especially Berlin, contain many excellent examples of house architecture,
mostly in the Renaissance style, sufficiently monumental in design, though usually, like most
German work, inclined to heaviness of detail. The too free use of stucco in imitation of stone
is also open to criticism.

+VIENNA.+ During the last thirty years Vienna has undergone a transformation which has made it
the rival of Paris as a stately capital.

The remodelling of the central portion, the creation of a series of magnificent boulevards and
squares, and the grouping of the chief state and municipal buildings about these upon a monumental
scheme of arrangement, have given the city an unusual aspect of splendor. Among the most important
monuments in this group are the +Parliament House+, by Hansen (see p. 360), and the +Town Hall+,
by Schmidt. This latter is a Neo-Gothic edifice of great size and pretentiousness, but strangely
thin and meagre in detail, and quite out of harmony with its surroundings.

The university and museums are massive piles in Renaissance style; and it is the Renaissance
rather than the classic or Gothic revival which prevails throughout the new city. The great
blocks of residences and apartments (Fig. 214) which line its streets are highly ornate in their architecture,
but for the most part done in stucco, which fails after all to give the aspect of solidity and
durability which it seeks to counterfeit.

The city of +Buda-Pesth+ has also in recent years undergone a phenomenal
transformation of a similar nature to that effected in Vienna, but
it possesses fewer monuments of conspicuous architectural interest.

The +Synagogue+ is the most noted of these, a rich and pleasing edifice of brick in a modified Hispano-Moresque
style.

+GREAT BRITAIN.+ During the closing years of the Anglo-Greek style a coterie of enthusiastic students
of British mediæval monuments--archæologists rather than architects--initiated a movement for
the revival of the national Gothic architecture. The first fruits of this movement, led by Pugin, Brandon,
Rickman, and others (about 1830-40), were seen in countless pseudo-Gothic structures in which
the pointed arches, buttresses, and clustered shafts of mediæval architecture were imitated or
parodied according to the designer’s ability, with frequent misapprehension
of their proper use or significance.

This unintelligent misapplication of Gothic forms was, however, confined
to the earlier stages of the movement.

With increasing light and experience came a more correct and consistent
use of the mediæval styles, dominated by the same spirit of archæological
correctness which had produced the classicismo of the Late Renaissance
in Italy.

This spirit, stimulated by extensive enterprises in the restoration of the great mediæval
monuments of the United Kingdom, was fatal to any free and original development of the style along
new lines. But it rescued church architecture from the utter meanness and debasement into which
it had fallen, and established a standard of taste which reacted on all other branches of
design.

+THE VICTORIAN GOTHIC.+ Between 1850 and 1870 the striving after archæological correctness gave
place to the more rational effort to adapt Gothic principles to modern requirements, instead
of merely copying extinct styles. This effort, prosecuted by a number of architects of great intelligence,
culture, and earnestness (Sir Gilbert Scott, George Edmund Street,
William Burges, and others), resulted in a number of extremely interesting
buildings.

Chief among these in size and cost stand the +Parliament Houses+ at Westminster, by Sir Charles
Barry (begun 1839), in the Perpendicular style. This immense structure (Fig. 215), imposing in its
simple masses and refined in its carefully studied detail, is the most successful monument of
the Victorian Gothic style.

It suffers, however, from the want of proper relation of scale between its decorative elements
and the vast proportions of the edifice, which belittle its component
elements.

It cannot, on the whole, be claimed as a successful vindication of the claims of the promoters
of the style as to the adaptability of Gothic forms to structures
planned and built after the modern fashion.

The +Assize Courts+ at Manchester (Fig. 216), the +New Museum+ at Oxford, the gorgeous +Albert Memorial+
at London, by Scott, and the +New Law Courts+ at London, by Street, are all conspicuous illustrations
of the same truth.

They are conscientious, carefully studied designs in good taste, and yet wholly unsuited in style
to their purpose. They are like labored and scholarly verse in a foreign tongue, correct in
form and language, but lacking the naturalness and charm of true and unfettered inspiration.
A later essay of the same sort in a slightly different field is the +Natural History Museum+
at South Kensington, by Waterhouse (1879), an imposing building in a modified Romanesque style
(Fig. 217).

+OTHER WORKS.+ The Victorian Gothic style responded to no deep and
general movement of the popular taste, and, like the Anglo-Greek style,
was doomed to failure from the inherent incongruity between modern
needs and mediæval forms.

Within the last twenty years there has been a quite general return to Renaissance principles,
and the result is seen in a large number of town-halls, exchanges,
museums, and colleges, in which Renaissance forms, with and without
the orders, have been treated with increasing freedom and skilful
adaptation to the materials and special requirements of each case.

The Albert Memorial Hall (1863, by General Scott) may be taken as an early instance of this
movement, and the +Imperial Institute+ (Colonial offices), by Collcutt, and Oxford Town Hall,
by Aston Webb, as among its latest manifestations.

In domestic architecture the so-called Queen Anne style has been much in vogue, as practised
by Norman Shaw, Ernest George, and others. It is really a modern style, originating in the imitation
of the modified Palladian style as used in the brick architecture of Queen Anne’s time, but
freely and often artistically altered to meet modern tastes and needs.

In its emancipation from the mistaken principles of archæological revivals, and in its evidences
of improved taste and awakened originality, contemporary British
architecture shows promise of good things to come.

It is still inferior to the French in the monumental quality, in
technical resource and refinement of decorative detail.

+ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.+ In other European countries recent architecture
shows in general increasing freedom and improved good taste, but both
its opportunities and its performance have been nowhere else as conspicuous
as in France, Germany, and England.

The costly Bourse and the vast but overloaded Palais de Justice at Brussels, by Polaert, are
neither of them conspicuous for refined and cultivated taste. A few buildings of note in Switzerland,
Russia, and Greece might find mention in a more extended review of architecture, but cannot
here even be enumerated.

In Italy, especially at Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin, there has
been a great activity in building since 1870, but with the exception
of the +Monument to Victor Emmanuel+ and the National Museum at Rome,
monumental arcades and passages at Milan and Naples, and Campi Santi
or monumental cemeteries at Bologna, Genoa, and one or two other places,
there has been almost nothing of real importance built in Italy of
late years.

      Follow all the migratory
tribe! follow while the air is yet open to you, or stay behind with the sick and the old and
the faint of heart and the fighters against instinct! Winter comes. It is time to make haste.'"
He laid the feather down with a smile. "That's Adam. Well, Adam, we will see how swift the
Bienville can fly! I may yet be first at New Orleans. Wilkinson and I to welcome Burr and all
the motley in his river-boats with a salvo from the city already ours. Ha! that's a silvery
dream, Tom, and an eagle's pinion for Adam's blackbird quill!" He laughed and took up his hat.
"Let's down the street first, and then you may find the man from the Bienville. There's a long
day's work before us, and to-night"--He drew a quick breath. "To-night I have a task that is
not slight. Come away! It's striking twelve."

The two closed the office and went out into the sunny street. "Where are all the people?" exclaimed
Mocket. "It's as still as Sunday."

A boy at a shop door, hearing the remark, raised a piping voice. "Everybody's down at the Eagle
and the post-office, sir. I heard them say there's big news. Maybe the President's dead!"

The distance to the Eagle was but short. Rand walked so rapidly that his companion had difficulty
to keep beside him, and walked in silence, cutting short every attempt of Tom's to speak. They
came within sight of the tavern. The long lower porch seemed crowded, the street in front filled
with people. There were horsemen, a coach and a chaise or two, a rapid shifting of brown, green,
blue, and plum-coloured coats, a gleam here and there of a woman's dress. A bugle sounded,
and there issued from Governor Street first a roll of drums and a shouted order, and then a
company in blue and white with tall, nodding plumes.

"There are the Blues!" cried Tom. "My land! What is the fuss about?"

They were now upon the edge of the throng, which suddenly fell from excited talking to a breathless
attention. A tall man of commanding presence and ringing voice had mounted a chair, set at
the top of the steps to the Eagle porch, and unfolded a paper. Rand touched upon the shoulder
the man before him. "Mr. Ritchie, I have just come in from the country, and have heard nothing.
What, sir, is the matter?"

"Treason, sir!" answered the editor of the Enquirer. "Treason. An attempt to disrupt the Republic!
A blow in the face of Washington and Henry and Franklin, of the sacred dead and the patriot
living! The lie direct to the Constitution! Apollyon stretching himself, sir; but, by gad!
Apollyon foiled! Listen, and you will hear. Foushee's reading the Proclamation for the second
time."

"Ah," said Rand, in a curious voice. "A Proclamation. From--"

"From the President. Evil hasn't prospered, and though we can't hang Apollyon, we can hang
Aaron Burr. Listen now."

The reader's voice was sonorous, and his text came fully to all the
crowd in the Richmond street.
     And I hereby enjoin and require all officers, civil or military, of
     the United States, or of any of the States or Territories, and
     especially all Governors, and other executive authorities, all
     judges, justices, and other officers of the peace, all military
     officers of the militia, to be vigilant, each within his respective
     department and according to his functions, in searching out and
     bringing to condign punishment all persons engaged or concerned in
     such enterprise, and in seizing and detaining, subject to the
     disposition of the law, all vessels, arms, military stores, or
     other means provided or providing for the same, and in general
     preventing the carrying on such expedition or enterprise by all the
     lawful means within their power. And I require all good and
     faithful citizens and others within the United States to be aiding
     and assisting herein, and especially in the discovery,
     apprehension, and bringing to justice of all such offenders, and
     the giving information against them to the proper authorities. Given at the City of Washington on the twenty-seventh day of
     November, 1806, and of the sovereignty and Independence of the
     United States the thirty-first.

     "THOMAS JEFFERSON."

"That isn't all," said Mr. Ritchie in Rand's ear. "The plot was not only against Spain--it
looked to the separation of the West from the East, with the Alleghanies for the wall between.
General Wilkinson is the hero. It seems that Burr thought to implicate him and secure the army.
Wilkinson sent Burr's letters in cipher to the President. The Government has had knowledge
from various sources, and while he was thought to be dozing last summer, Mr. Jefferson was
as wide awake as you or I. The militia are out in Wood County, and Burr will be taken somewhere
upon the Ohio. Wilkinson has put New Orleans under martial law. Informer or no, he's now more
loyal than loyalty itself. The Bienville is to be searched at Norfolk for a consignment of
arms. They say Eaton's implicated, and Alston, Bollman, Swartwout, and this man Blennerhassett.
Truxtun's name is mentioned, and it's said that Decatur was applied to. Andrew Jackson, too,
has been friendly with Burr. Well, we'll see what we will see! Treason and traitor are ugly
words, Mr. Rand."

"They are so considered, Mr. Ritchie," said Rand, with calmness. "Thanks for your courtesy,
and good-morning!"

He bowed and made his way, not unaccosted, through the crowd to the Eagle porch. There was
much excitement. The Governor was speaking from the head of the steps. Below him planters,
merchants, lawyers, and politicians were now listening eagerly, now commenting sotto voce,
while beyond them the nondescript population swayed and exclaimed. To one side were massed
the tall plumes of the Blues. Rand saw, near these, Fairfax Cary's handsome face, not pale
as it had been between nine and ten o'clock, but alert, flushed, and--or so Rand interpreted
its light and energy--triumphant. He went on into the house, ordered and drank a small quantity
of brandy, and when he came back upon the porch was met by those near him with a cry of "Speech!
Speech!" The Governor's periods were at an end, and John Randolph of Roanoke held the impromptu
tribune. Rand's eloquence, if not as impassioned and mordant, was as overwhelming, and his
reasoning of a closer texture. Those around him loudly claimed him for the next to address
the crowd, which now numbered a great part of the free men of Richmond. He shook off the detaining
hands and, with a gesture of refusal to one and all, made his escape by a side step into the
miscellany of the street, and finally out of the throng, and, by a détour, back to the deserted
square where stood his office. He had lost sight of Mocket, but as he put his key into the
door, the other came panting up, and the two entered the bare, sunshine-flooded room together.
Rand locked the door and, without a look at his trembling subaltern, proceeded to take from
his desk paper after paper, some in neatly tied packets, some in single sheets, until a crisp
white heap lay on the wood beneath his hand. "Light a fire," he said over his shoulder. "There's
absolutely nothing, is there, in that desk of yours?"

"Nothing. For the Lord's sake, Lewis, is this the end of everything?"

"Everything is a large word. It is the end of this." He pushed a table closer to the fireplace
and transferred to it his armful of papers. "Strike a light, will you? Here goes every line
that can incriminate. If Burr did as he was told, and burned two letters of mine, there'll
not be a word when I finish here." He tore a paper across and tossed it into the flame. "Tom,
Tom, don't look so woe-begone! Life is long, and now and then a battle will be lost. A battle--a
campaign, a war! But given the fighter, all wars will not be lost. Somewhere, there awaits
Victory, hard-won, but laurel-crowned!" He tore and burned another paper. "This fat's in the
fire, this chance has gone by, this road's barricaded, and we must across country to another!
Well, I shall make it serve, the smooth, green, country road that jog-trots to market! What
is man but a Mercenary, a Swiss, to die before whatever door will give him moderate pay? I
would have had a kingdom an I could. I would have ruled, ay, by God, and ruled well! The great
wheel will not have it so. Down, then, that action! and up this. The King is dead: long live
the King!--alias the Law, Respectability, Virginia, and the Union!" He tossed in a double handful.

"All those!" said Tom dully. "I hate to see them burn."

"They might have burned this morning," answered the other. "I gave you orders to burn them
if I fell, the moment you heard it."

"But you did not fall."

"No. He fired into the air." Rand tore the paper in his hand across and across. "He had me
in his trap. That was why--that was why he spared to fire! Oh, I could take this check from
the hand of Fortune, or the hand of Malice, or the hand of Treachery, or the hand of Policy,
but, but"--he crushed the torn paper in his hands, then flung it from him with a violent and
sinister gesture--"to take it from the hand of Ludwell Cary--that requires more than my philosophy
is prepared to give! Let him look to himself!" He thrust in another bundle, and held down with
an ashen stick the mass of curling leaves.

CHAPTER XXV

OLD SAINT JOHN'S

The distance was so great from the more populous part of the town to Saint John's on Church
Hill, and the road thereto so steep, in hot weather dusty, in wet deep in mud, that it had
become the Richmond custom to worship within the Capitol, in the Hall of the House of Delegates.
But during this August of the year 1807 the habit was foregone. It was the month in which Aaron
Burr, arrested in Alabama in January, brought to Richmond in the early spring, and, since the
finding of a true bill, confined in the penitentiary without the town, was to be tried for
his life on the charge of high treason. Early and late, during the week, every apartment of
the Capitol was in requisition, and though the building itself was closed on Sunday, the Capitol
Square remained, a place of rendezvous, noise, heat, confusion, and dispute. There was in the
town a multitude of strangers, with a range from legal, political, military, and naval heights,
through a rolling country of frontiersmen, to a level of Ohio boatmen, servants, and nondescript.
Many were witnesses subpoenaed by the Government, others had been called by Burr, and yet others
brought upon the scene by varied interests, or by the sheer, compelling curiosity which the
trial evoked. One and all were loudly and fiercely partisan. The lesser sort and ruder fry
congregated in numbers beneath the trees about the Capitol, and it was thought with propriety
that during this month church-going ladies would prefer to attend Saint John's. Here, therefore,
on a Sunday in mid-August, the Reverend John Buchanan preached to a large and noteworthy assemblage.

The day was hot, but the chestnut trees and sycamores gave a grateful shade, and large white
clouds in a brilliant blue threw now and then a transient screen between sun and earth. The
broad and murmuring river and the far stretch of woodland upon the Chesterfield side gave,
too, a sensation of space and coolness. Faint airs carried the smell of midsummer flowers,
and bees droned around the flat tombstones sunk in honeysuckle. The congregation gathered slowly,
the masculine portion of it lingering, as was the custom, in the wide old churchyard until
the second tinkling of the bell should call them indoors. They had thus the double advantage
of talk and observation of the Progress of Women. These traversed the path to the church door
like a drift of blossoms in the summer air, saluted on either hand by the lowest of bows, the
most gallant lifting of bell-shaped hats. Whatever might be said of the men's dress, from the
fair top-boot to the yards of lawn that swathed the throat, that of the weaker sex, in the
days of the Empire, was admirably fitted for August weather. Above pale, thin stuffs, girdled
beneath the breast and falling straight and narrow to the instep, rose bare white neck and
arms, while each charming face looked forth from an umbrageous bonnet of fine straw. Bonnet
and large fan appeared the only ample articles of attire; even the gloves were but mitts. By
ones and twos, or in larger knots, the wearers of this slender finery entered Saint John's
with sedateness, took their seats in the dim old pews, and waited in the warm, fragrant, whisper-filled
air for the ringing of the second bell and the entrance of the men. After church, custom would
still reign, and all alike would linger, laugh, and talk beneath the trees, while the coaches
drew up slowly and the grooms brought the saddle-horses from the rack, and those who meant
to walk gathered courage for the dusty venture.

Jacqueline Rand and Unity Dandridge, the one in her customary white, the other in a blue that
marvellously set off dark hair, dark eyes, and brilliant bloom, entered Saint John's together
and passed up the aisle to a seat halfway between door and pulpit. By some miscalculation of
Unity's they were very early, a fact which presently brought a whispered ejaculation of annoyance
from Miss Dandridge. "I love a flutter when I come in and the knowledge that I've turned every
head--and here we've entered an empty church! Heigho! Nothing to do for half an hour."

"Read your prayer book," suggested Jacqueline. "Oh! does it open just there as easily as all that?"

"It always did open just there," answered Miss Dandridge. "It's something in the binding. Heigho!
'Love, honour, and obey.' Obey!"

"Your entrance," said her cousin, "was not entirely unseen, and here comes one whose head is
certainly turned."

"Is it?" asked Unity, and hastily closed the prayer book as Fairfax Cary entered the pew behind
them.

Jacqueline turned and greeted the young man with a smile. There was now between Greenwood and
Roselands, between the house on Shockoe Hill and the quarters of the Carys at the Swan, a profound
breach, an almost utter division. Lewis Rand and Ludwell Cary were private as well as political
enemies, and all men knew as much. There had been no attempt on the part of either to conceal
the fact of the duel in November. Their world of town and country surmised and conjectured,
volubly or silently, according to company, drew its conclusions, and chose its colours. The
conclusions were largely false, for it occurred to no one--at least outside of Fontenoy--to
connect the quarrel and the duel with the President's proclamation and the Burr conspiracy.
During the past winter Cary had been much in Albemarle, little in Richmond, and the encounters
of the two had not been frequent. In the spring, however, matters had brought him to the city,
and in the fever and excitement of the ensuing summer he and Rand were often thrown into company.
When this was the case, they spoke with a bare and cold civility, and left each other's neighbourhood
as soon as circumstances permitted. Cary came, of course, no more to the house on Shockoe Hill.
Jacqueline, remaining in town through the summer because her husband remained, saw him now
and again in some public place or gathering. He bowed low and she inclined her head, but they
did not speak. Her heart was hot and pained. She had pleaded that afternoon in the cedar wood
for his better understanding of Lewis, and to what purpose?--an open quarrel and a duel! She
did not want to speak; she wanted to forget him.

But for Fairfax Cary, friend and shadow though he was of the elder brother, her feeling was
different. He was a man to be liked for himself, and he loved and was to marry Unity. He adopted
his brother's quarrel: he and Lewis barely spoke, and that despite the fact that Lewis had
for him a strange half-grim, half-vexed admiration; he came no more than the elder Cary to
the house on Shockoe; but when they met abroad, Jacqueline was sure of some greeting, half
gay, half stiff, some talk of Fontenoy, some exchange of sentiment upon one topic dear to each,
some chivalrous compliment to herself. He made a gallant and devoted lover, and Jacqueline
could not but applaud Unity's choice and feel for him an almost unmixed kindness.

Because of the trial, which drew friends, kindred, and acquaintances to Richmond, the marriage,
which was to have been celebrated in August, had been postponed to September. Unity came to
town for a month and stayed with her cousin. Her lover would not enter Lewis Rand's house,
nor did she ask him to do so. Her kindred in Richmond were numerous, and they might and did
meet in a score of Federalist mansions, at various places of entertainment, and, as now, at church.

He answered Jacqueline's welcome and Miss Dandridge's bright blush and brief "How d'ye do?"
with the not-too-profound bow, the subdued and deprecatory smile, and the comparative absence
of compliment that church demanded, then, seating himself, leaned forward with his arm upon
the back of their pew and entered into low-toned conversation.

"They were early."--"Yes: too early!"--"So much the better, for now they could see all the
famous folk enter. Army, Navy, Law, and Letters are all coming to church. To-morrow is the
indictment."

"Ah!" murmured Jacqueline; and Unity, "They say he held a levee at the Penitentiary yesterday.
Personally, I prefer a surly traitor to one who is so affable, smiling, and witty."

"I also," agreed her lover. "But Colonel Burr is no Grand Seigneur of a traitor out of the
dismal romances that you read! He meant no harm--not he! His ideas of meum and tuum may be
vague, but when all's said, he's the most courteous gentleman and a boon companion! I think
that we are well-nigh the only Federalists in town who have not forgotten that this man slew
Hamilton, and who keep the fact in mind that, defend him as they please, his counsel cannot
say, He loved his country and wished no other empire!' After the indictment to-morrow, Hay
will speak and the Government begin to call its witnesses. Who is this coming in--the lady
with Mrs. Carrington? Look! It's Burr's daughter--it's Mrs. Alston!"

"She's a brave woman," said Unity. "One can't but honour such spirit, courage, and loyalty.
She's dressed as if it were a gala day!"

"If you'll let me pass," whispered Jacqueline, "I will speak to her. We met at the Amblers'
the other night. There's an anxious heart behind that fine fire!"

She rose and, slipping past Unity, moved up the aisle to the Carrington pew. The two left behind
looked after the gliding white figure in silence. Unity sighed. "To me Lewis Rand's like a
giant, and she's like his captive. And yet--and yet there's much that's likeable in the giant,
and I can perfectly well see how the captive might adore him!"

"I can't," retorted the other. "I'll grant his ability, but there's a little worm at the heart!
Even his genius will one day turn against him; it is the tree too tall that falls the soonest.
He's not coming here to-day?"

"No. He's out of town. All the Republican papers are wondering why the President did not include
him among the counsel for the Government."

"I dare say," said the younger Cary grimly. "Well, that would have been an entertainment worth
hearing, that speech for the prosecution!"

"Don't let's talk of him any more. I feel a traitor to Jacqueline when I do. How slow the people
are in coming!"

"They may stay away as long as they please," murmured her lover. "I like a quiet time for worship
before all the fuss and flutter. You should always wear blue, Unity."

"You told me yesterday that I should always wear pink. At last, here enters a man!"

"It is Winfield Scott, just up from Williamsburgh. He doesn't like the law and will go into
the army. Here are all the Randolphs and the beautiful Mrs. Peyton!"

Unity moved to let Jacqueline reënter the pew. The church was beginning to fill, and the whispering
and noise of fluttering fans increased. All the windows were open to the breeze, and the soft
scents and sounds and colours, the dimness within the church, and the August skies and waving
trees without, combined to give a drowsy, mellow, and enchanted air to old Saint John's and
to the gathering people.

"The choir have come into the gallery," said Fairfax Cary. "I hear the scrape of Fitzwhyllson's
viol."

"The quiet is over and here comes the world," answered Jacqueline. "Who is that with Mr. Wickham--the
tall, lean man?"

"It is the Governor of Tennessee and a fire-eater for Burr--Andrew Jackson by name. The third
man is Luther Martin."

"He may be learned in the law," murmured Unity, "but I would like to know the University that
taught him dress. See, Jacqueline, Charlotte Foushee has the newest bonnet yet!"

"That is Commodore Truxtun coming in with Edmund Randolph. He looks a seaman, every inch of
him! Who is the young gentleman in blue?"

"Oh, that," replied Unity, "is Mr. Washington Irving of New York. He has just returned from
the Grand Tour, and he writes most beautifully. He has sent me an acrostic for my keepsake
that--that--"

"That I could not have written had I tried till doomsday," finished Fairfax Cary. "Do you like
acrostics, Mrs. Rand?"

Jacqueline smiled. "No, nor keepsakes either. Unity and I both like strong prose and books
with meanings. Her façons de parler are many."

"Well, anyhow," said Miss Dandridge, "I like Mr. Washington Irving. He doesn't only write acrostics;
he writes prose as well. Here is the Chief Justice."

"The second bell is ringing. We'll have all the churchyard now. Here comes the Tenth Legion--Hay,
Wirt, and McRae! Mark Wirt bow to Martin!"

"Will General Wilkinson be here?"

"Speak of--one that's often named in church--and see the waving of his red cockfeather! This
is the General now. Ahem! he looks what he is."

"And the other with the sash?"

"Eaton. They are both tarred with the same brush! Here, coming toward us, is one of very different
make! You met him yesterday, did you not? Ha! Captain Decatur, allow me to give you anchorage!"

As he spoke, he held open the pew door. Captain Stephen Decatur smiled, bowed, and entered,
and was presently greeting with a manly, frank, and engaging manner the beautiful Mrs. Rand
and the equally lovely Miss Dandridge, to both of whom he had been presented at an evening
entertainment. The church was now filled and the bell ceased ringing. From the gallery came
the deeper growl of the bass viol and the preliminary breath of a flute.

The choir in the gallery, viol, flute, and voices, took up the strain, and the congregation
beneath following in their turn, there arose and floated through the windows a veritable pæan,
so sweet and loud that the boatmen on the river heard.

On went the service until the sermon was reached, and on went the sermon from "firstly" to
"eighteenthly and last, my brethren." The sermon was upon Charity, and included no allusion
to the topic of the day uppermost in men's minds, for this minister never evinced any party
spirit, and thought politics not his province. The discourse ended, the plate was carried and
the benediction given, whereupon, after a decorous pause, the congregation streamed forth to
the green and warm churchyard.

Here it broke into groups, flowery bright on the part of the women, gallant and gay enough
on the side of the attending gentlemen. The broad path was like the unfolding of a figured
ribbon, and the sward on either hand like sprinkled taffeta. The sky between the large white
clouds showed bluer than blue, and the leaves of the sycamores trembled in a small, refreshing
breeze. The birds were silent, but the insect world filled with its light voice the space between
all other sounds. Outside the gate coaches and horses waited. There was no hurry; the ribbon
unrolled but slowly, and the blossomy knots upon the taffeta as leisurely shifted position.

Theodosia Alston and Jacqueline came out of church together, in a cluster of Carringtons and
Amblers. Besides her affianced, Unity had for company Captain Decatur, Mr. Irving, and Mr.
Scott. The throng, pressing between, separated the cousins. Aaron Burr's daughter, though she
talked and laughed with spirit and vivacity, was so evidently anxious to be away that the friend
with whom she had come made haste down the path to their waiting coach. Jacqueline, meaning
to tarry but a moment beside the woman for whom all, of whatever party, had only admiration
and sympathy, found herself drawn along the path to the gate. The Carrington coach rolled away,
and she was left almost alone in the sunny lower end of the churchyard.

The ribbon was unrolling toward her, and she waited, glad of the moment's quiet. She saw Unity's
forget-me-not blue, and Charlotte Foushee's bonnet, piquant and immense, and Mrs. Randolph's
lilac lutestring, and all the blue and green and wine-coloured coats of the men moving toward
her as in a summer dream, gay midges in a giant shaft of sunlight. A great bee droned past
her to the honeysuckle upon the wall against which she leaned. She watched the furred creature,
barred and golden, and thought suddenly of the bees about the mimosa on the Three-Notched Road.

A middle-aged gentleman, of a responsible and benevolent cast of countenance, came up to her.
"A very good day to you, my dear Mrs. Rand!"

"And to you, Colonel Nicholas."

"You are of my mind. You do not care to dilly-dally after church. 'Tis as bad as a London rout,
where you move an inch an hour. Well, there are men here to-day who have made some stir in
the world! Do you go to-morrow to the Capitol?"

"Yes. My cousin and I have seats with Mrs. Wickham."

"It will not be such a trial as was Warren Hastings's. Yet it will have its value both to the
eye and the ear. If it were possible, I would have there every young boy in town. Is Mr. Rand
at home?"

"No. He is in Williamsburgh for several days."

The gentleman hesitated. "Vexatious! I have something for his own hand, and I myself go out
of town after to-morrow. It may be important--"

"Cannot I give it to him?"

"It is a small packet, or letter, from the President. He sent it to me by a private messenger,
with a note asking me to do him the friendly service to place it directly in Mr. Rand's hand.
I have it with me, as I thought I might meet Mr. Rand here."

"He will hardly return before Wednesday. When he comes, I will give him the letter with pleasure."

The other took from his pocket a thick letter, strongly sealed, and addressed in Jefferson's
fine, precise hand. "I must be away from Richmond for a week or more, and the matter may be
important. I can conceive no reason why, so that it be put directly into Mr. Rand's hand, one
agent should be better than another. I'll confide it to you, Mrs. Rand."

"I will do as the President directs, Colonel Nicholas, and will give it to my husband the moment
he returns."

She put out her hand, and he laid the packet in it. Hanging from her arm by a rose-coloured
ribbon was a small bag of old brocade. This she opened, and slipped into the silken depths
the President's somewhat heavy missive. "He shall have it on Wednesday," she said.

The dispersing congregation touched and claimed them. Mr. Wirt and Commodore Truxtun bore off
her companion, and she herself, after a moment of gay talk with all the Randolphs, rejoined
Unity and her court. Fairfax Cary called their coach, and Captain Decatur and Mr. Irving and
Mr. Scott saw them in, and still talked at the lowered windows until Big Isham on the box,
with a loud crack of his whip, put the greys in motion.

The coach went slowly down the hill. Unity yawned and waved her fan. "I like Captain Decatur.
Think of sailing into a tropic harbour and destroying the Philadelphia on a day like this!
Lend me your fan; it is larger than mine. What have you in your bag?"

"My prayer book, and something that Colonel Nicholas gave me for Lewis. I could think only
of Theodosia Alston, and of how long to-night will be to her!"

"She believes that he will be acquitted."

"She does not know, and pictures of what we fear are dreadful! Knowledge is like death sometimes,
but not to know is like frightened dying! Oh, warm, warm! I shall be glad when it is all over
and we leave Richmond for the mountains and the streams again, and for your wedding, dearest
heart!"

"Oh, my wedding!" said Unity. "My wedding's like a dream. I don't believe I'm going to have
any wedding!"

CHAPTER XXVI

THE TRIAL OF AARON BURR

At an early hour the crowd in the Hall of the House of Delegates was very great, and as it
drew toward the time when the principals in the drama would appear, the press of the people
and the heat of the August day grew well-nigh intolerable. In the gallery were many women,
and their diaphanous gowns and the incessant flutter of their fans imparted to this portion
of the Hall a pale illusion of comfort. In the hall below, men stood upon the window-sills,
choked the entrances, crowded the corridors without. Not only was there a throng where something
might be heard and seen, but the portico of the Capitol had its numbers, and the green surrounding
slopes a concourse avid of what news the birds might bring. Within and without, the heat was
extreme, even for August in Tidewater Virginia; an atmosphere sultry and boding, tense with
the feeling of an approaching storm.

In the gallery, beside Unity and Mrs. Wickham, around her women of Federalist families who
were loath to believe any one guilty who was prosecuted, or persecuted, by the present Government,
and women of Republican houses who asserted, while they waved their fans, that, being guilty,
Aaron Burr must be, should be, would be hanged! sat Jacqueline Rand, and wondered somewhat
at her weakness in coming there that day. It had been, perhaps, in the last analysis, a painful
curiosity, a vague desire to see the place, the men, all the circumstance and environment,
with which her husband--she thanked God with every breath--had no connection! He might have
had here his part, she knew tremulously; it might have been his role to stand here beside Aaron
Burr, and, with a passionately humble and grateful heart, she nursed the memory of that winter
night when he had sworn to her that from that hour he and this enterprise should be strangers.

There had been days and weeks of preliminaries to the actual trial for high treason, but she
had not before been in this hall. All her delicacy shrank from the thought of sitting here
beside her husband, conscious of his consciousness that she knew all that might have been,
and saw in fancy more prisoners at the bar than one. No man would like that. He had come often
to the Capitol during the days of skirmishing prior to the general engagement; had he not done
so, it would have been at once remarked. She expressed no desire to accompany him, nor did
he ever ask her to do so. She was aware of the general surprise that he had no place among
the Government counsel. Whether or not such place had been offered to him, pressed upon him,
she did not know, but she thought it possible that this was the case. If so, he had refused
as was right. Acceptance, she knew, would have been impossible.

All through these months there had been between them a silent pact, a covenant to avoid all
superfluous mention of the topic which met them on every hand, from every mouth, in every letter
or printed sheet. Rand was much occupied with important cases, much in demand in various portions
of the state, much away from home. She was not a woman to demand as her right entrance into
every chamber of another's soul. Her own had its hushed rooms, its reticences, its altars built
to solitude; she was aware that beyond, below, above the fair chamber where he entertained
her were other spaces in her husband's nature. Into some she looked as through open door and
clear windows, but others were closed to her, and she was both too proud and too pure of thought
to search for keys that had not been offered her.

She knew that her husband had not meant to be absent from Richmond that day. An unexpected
turn in the case he was conducting had compelled his presence in Williamsburgh, and on the
other hand, in Richmond, the labour of finding an impartial jury had been brought to a sudden
end by Burr's coup de main in refusing to challenge and calmly accepting as prejudiced a twelve
as perhaps, in the United States of America, ever decided whether a man should live or die.
The move had hastened the day when the Government was to begin its cannonade.

Lewis was yet in Williamsburgh. Had he been present in this hail, watching events with his
fellow lawyers, fellow politicians, fellow countrymen, who knew nothing of one snowy night
a year ago last February, his wife, for both their sakes, would have remained away. As it was,
she had been persuaded. Unity would not for much have missed the spectacle, friends had been
pressing, and at last her own painful interest prevailed. She was here now, and she sat as
in a waking dream, her hands idle, her eyes, wide and dark, steadily fixed upon the scene below.
She saw, leaning against a window, Ludwell Cary, and, the centre of a cluster of men in hunting-shirts,
Adam Gaudylock.

The Capitol clock struck twelve. As the last stroke died upon the feverish air, the Chief Justice
entered the Hall and took the Speaker's chair. Beside him was Cyrus Griffin, the District Judge.
Hay, the District Attorney, with his associates William Wirt and Alexander McRae, now appeared,
and immediately afterward the imposing array of the prisoner's counsel, a phalanx which included
no less than four sometime Attorneys-General and two subalterns of note. These took the seats
reserved for them; the marshal and his deputies pressed the people back, and the jury entered
and filled the jury box. Below and near them sat a medley of witnesses--important folk, and
folk whom only this trial made important.

A loud murmur was now heard from without; the marshal's men, red and perspiring, cleared a
thread-like path, and the prisoner, accompanied by his son-in-law, entered the Hall. He was
dressed in black, with carefully powdered hair. Quiet, cool, smiling, and collected, he was
brought to the bar, when, having taken his place, bowed to the judges, and greeted his counsel,
he turned slightly and surveyed with his composed face and his extremely keen black eyes the
throng that with intentness looked on him in turn. It was by no means their first encounter
of eyes. The preliminaries of that famous trial had been many and prolonged. From the prisoner's
arrival in April under military escort to the present moment, through the first arraignment
at that bar, the assembling of the Grand Jury, the tedious waiting for Wilkinson's long-deferred
arrival from New Orleans, the matter of the subpoena to the President with which the country
rang, the adjournment from June to August, the victory gained by the defence in the exclusion
of Wilkinson's evidence, and the clamour of the two camps into which the city was divided,--through
all this had been manifest the prisoner's deliberate purpose and attempt to make every fibre
of a personality ingratiating beyond that of most, tell in its own behalf. He had able advocates,
but none more able than Aaron Burr. His day and time was, on the whole, a time astonishingly
fluid and naïve, and he impressed it.

There was in this moment, therefore, no novelty of encounter between him and the stare of the
opposing throng. He was not seeing them, nor they him, for the first time. Yet the situation
had its high intensity. This day was the beginning of the actual trial, and only the day which
brought the verdict could outweigh it in importance. This was the lighting of the lamp that
was to search out mysteries; this was the bending of the bow; this was the first rung of the
ladder which might lead--where? As John Marshall's voice was heard from the bench and the prisoner
turned from his steadfast contemplation of the throng, a psychic wave overflowed and lifted
all the great assembly. This was spectacle, this was drama! The oldest of all the first principles
stirred under the stimulus, and with savage naturalness sucked in the sense of pageant.

The court was opened. Counsel on both sides brought forward and disposed of a minor point or
two, then, amid a silence so great that the twittering of the martins outside the windows seemed
importunate and shrill, proclamation was made, the prisoner stood up, and the indictment was read.

And so on through much thunderous repetition to the final,--

"And the said Aaron Burr with the said persons as aforesaid traitorously assembled and armed
and arranged in manner aforesaid, most wickedly, maliciously, and traitorously did ordain,
prepare, and levy war against the said United States, and further to fulfil and carry into
effect the said traitorous compassings, imaginings, and intentions of him the said Aaron Burr,
and to carry on the war thus levied as aforesaid against the United States, the said Aaron
Burr with the multitude last mentioned, at the island aforesaid, in the said county of Wood
within the Virginia District aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court, did array
themselves in a warlike manner, with guns and other weapons, offensive and defensive, and did
proceed from the said island down the river Ohio in the county aforesaid, within the Virginia
District, and within the jurisdiction of this court, on the said eleventh day of December,
in the year one thousand, eight hundred and six aforesaid, with the wicked and traitorous intention
to descend the said river and the river Mississippi, and by force and arms traitorously to
take possession of the city commonly called New Orleans, in the territory of Orleans, belonging
to the United States, contrary to the duty of their said allegiance and fidelity, against the
Constitution, peace, and dignity of the United States and against the form of the Act of Congress
of the United States in such case made and provided."

The clerk ceased to read. When the last sonorous word had died upon the air, the audience yet
sat or stood in silence, bent a little forward, in the attitude of listeners. This lasted an
appreciable moment, then the tension snapped. Marshall moved slightly in his great chair, Judge
Griffin coughed, a rustling sound and a deep breath ran through the Hall. The prisoner, who
had faced with the most perfect composure the indictment's long thunder, now slightly inclined
his head to the Judges and took his seat. His counsel, ostentatiously easy and smiling, gathered
about him, and the District Attorney rose to open for the Government in a lengthy and able speech.

In the gallery, among the fluttering fans, Jacqueline asked herself if her rising and quitting
the place would disturb those about her. She was in the very front, beside the gallery rail,
there was a great crowd behind, she must stay it out. She bit her lip, forced back emotion,
strove with resolution to conquer the too visionary aspect of all things before her. It had
been foolish, she knew now, to come. She had not dreamed with what strong and feverish grasp
such a scene could take prisoner the imagination. She saw too plainly much that was not there;
she brought other figures into the Hall; abstractions and realities, they thronged the place.
The place itself widened until to her inner sense it was as wide as her world and her life.
Fontenoy was there and the house on the Three-Notched Road; Roselands, and much besides. For
all the heat, and the fluttering of the fans, and the roll of declamation from the District
Attorney, who was now upon the definition of treason, one night in February was there as well,
the night that had seen so much imperilled, the night that had seen, thank God! the cloud go
by. Of all the images that thronged upon her, creating a strange tumult of the soul, darkening
her eyes and driving the faint colour from her cheek, the image of that evening was the most
insistent. It was, perhaps, aided by her fancy that in that cool survey of the Hall in which
the prisoner indulged himself, his eyes, keen and darting as a snake's, had rested for a moment
upon her face. She could have said that there was in them a curious light of recognition, even
a cool amusement, a sarcasm,--the very memory of the look made for her a trouble vague, but
deep! Had he, too, given a thought to that evening, to the man whom he did not secure, and
to the woman with whom he had talked of black lace and Spanish songs? She wondered. But why
should Colonel Burr be amused, and why sarcastic? She abandoned the enquiry and listened to
the heavy lumbering up of Government cannon. "Courts of Great Britain--Foster's Crown Laws--Demaree
and Purchase--Vaughan--Lord George Gordon--Throgmorton--United States vs. Fries--Opinion of
Judge Chase--Of Judge Iredell--Overt Act--Overt Act proven--Arms, array and treasonable purpose;
here is bellum levatum if not bellum percussum-Treason and traitors, not potential but actual--their
discovery and their punishment--"

On boomed the guns of the prosecution. Jacqueline listened, fascinated for a time, but the
words at last grew to hurt her so that, could she have done so unobserved, she would have stopped
her ears with her hands. The feverish interest of the scene still held her in its grasp, but
the words were cruel and struck upon her heart. She could not free herself from the brooding
thought of how poignant, how burning, how deadly poisonous they had been to her, had all things
been different and she forced to sit in this place hearing them launched against another than
Aaron Burr, there, there at that bar! She unlocked her hands, drew a long and tremulous breath,
and, leaning a little forward, tried not to listen, and to lose herself in watching the throng
below. Her eyes fell, at once, upon Ludwell Cary.

He was standing where she had before marked him, beside a window almost opposite, his arm upon
the sill, his attention closely given to the District Attorney, who was now eulogising that
great patriot, General James Wilkinson. Now, while Jacqueline looked, he turned his head. It
was as though she had called and he had been ready with his answer.

Painfully raised in feeling and driven out of habitual citadels, tense and fevered, subtly
touched by the storm in the air, she found in the moment no sense of self-consciousness, no
question and no movement of aversion. She and Cary looked at each other long and fully, and
with something of an old understanding; on her part a softening of pardon for the quarrel and
the duel, on his a light and compassion that she could not clearly understand. She knew that
he read her thoughts, but if he, too, was remembering that evening long ago in February, he
must also remember that Lewis Rand gave up, that snowy night, definitely and forever, the fevered
ambitions, the too-high imaginings, the conqueror's thirst for power; gave them up, and turned
from the charmer into the path of right! There came into her heart a longing that Ludwell Cary
should see the matter truly. He should have done so that afternoon in the cedar wood; where
was the black mote that kept the vision out? She was suddenly aware--and it came to her with
a dizzying strangeness--that there was in her own soul that reference of matters to the bar
of Cary's idea, thought, and judgment which, that day in the cedar wood, she had told him existed
in that of her husband. Were she and Lewis grown so much alike? or had her own soul always
recognised, deferred to, rested upon, something in the inmost nature of the man into whose
eyes she looked across this thronged and fevered space--something of rare equanimity, dispassionate
yet tender, calm, high, impartial, and ideal? She did not know; she had not thought of it before.
Her eyes dilated. Suddenly she saw the drawing-room at Fontenoy, green and gold and cool, with
the portraits on the wall,--Edmund Churchill, who fought with King Charles; Henry his son,
who fled to Virginia and founded the family there; a second Edmund, aide-de-camp to Marlborough;
two Governors of Virginia and a President of the Council; the Lely and the Kneller--both Churchill
women; and the fair face and form of Grandaunt Jacqueline for whom she was named. She smelled
the roses in the bowls, and she saw herself singing at her harp. It was a night in June, the
night of the great thunderstorm. Lewis Rand had come down from the blue room, and Ludwell Cary
entered from the darkness of the storm.

Unity's hand touched her. "Jacqueline, are you tired? Would you like to go away?"

The spell broke. Jacqueline was most tired, and she would very much have liked to go away,
but a glance at her cousin and at the lady with whom they had come determined the question.
That to both it was as good as a play, colour and animation proclaimed, and Jacqueline had
not the heart to ring the curtain down. She shook her head and smiled. "We'll stay it out."

Her companion leaned back, relieved, and she was left to herself again. She knew that Cary's
eyes were still upon her, but she would not turn her own that way. She made herself look at
the judges upon the bench, the District Attorney, the opposing lawyers, even the prisoner.
It was the heat and the thunder in the air that made her so tense and yet so tremulous. Every
nerve to-day was like a harpstring tightly drawn where every wandering air must touch it. All
this would soon be over--then home and quiet! The day was growing old; even now Mr. Hay was
addressing the jury with an impressiveness that announced the closing periods of a speech.
When he was done, would not the court adjourn until to-morrow? It was said the trial might
last two weeks. Mr. Hay sat down, but alas! before the applause and stir had ceased, Mr. Wickham
was upon his feet.

Mr. Wirt followed Mr. Wickham, and was followed in turn by Luther Martin. The firing was heavy.
Boom, boom! went the guns of the Government, quick and withering came the fire from the defence.
If advantage of position was with the first, the last showed the higher generalship. The duel
was sharp, and it was followed by the spectators with strained interest. The Chief Justice
on the bench and the prisoner at the bar, attentive though they both were, alone of almost
all concerned seemed to watch the struggle calmly. It drew toward late afternoon. Luther Martin,
still upon the Overt Act, after an ironic compliment or two to the Government counsel, and
a statement that George Washington, the great and the good, might with a like innocency of
intents have found himself in a like position with Colonel Burr, withdrew his guns for the
night. The prosecution, after a glare of indignation, announced that on the morrow it would
begin examination of witnesses; the Chief Justice said a few weighty words, and the court was
adjourned.

Out to the air, the grass and the trees, the gleam of the distant James, and a tremendous and
fantastic show of clouds, piled along the horizon and flushed by the declining sun, streamed
the crowd. Excited and voluble, lavish of opinions that had been pent up for hours, and drinking
in greedily the fresher air, it made no haste to quit the Capitol portico or the Capitol Square.
There were friends and acquaintances to greet, noted people to speak to, or to hear and see
others speak to, the lawyers to congratulate and the judges to bow to--and last but not least,
there was the prisoner to mark enter, with the marshal, a plain coach and drive away to the
house opposite the Swan, to which he had been removed from his rooms in the Penitentiary.

The women who had observed the first day of the great trial from the gallery made, of course,
no such tarrying. They left the building and the square at once, and the men of their families
present saw them into their carriages, or, if the distance home was not great, watched them
walk away in little groups with a servant or two behind them.

At the head of the Capitol steps Jacqueline and Unity found Fairfax Cary awaiting them, and
upon the grass below they were joined by Mr. Washington Irving. Mrs. Wickham was with them,
Mrs. Carrington, Mrs. Ambler, and Miss Mayo. All the women lived within a short distance of
one another, and all, escorted by the two gentlemen, would walk the little way across Capitol
and Broad to Marshall Street. Unity was to take supper with Mrs. Carrington and to spend the
night with Mrs. Ambler, and she would not go home first, unless--She looked at Jacqueline.
"Did the fireworks frighten you, honey? Would you rather that I stayed with you?"

Jacqueline laughed. "The fireworks were alarming, weren't they, Mrs. Wickham? No, no; go with
Mrs. Carrington, Unity. To-night I'm going to write to Deb and read a novel." They were now
opposite the Chief Justice's house, and as she spoke, she paused and made a slight curtsy to
the elder ladies. "Our ways part here."

"I will walk with you to your door," said Fairfax Cary.

She shook her head. "No, do not. I am almost there." Then, as his intention still held, she
continued in a lower voice, "I had rather be alone. Obey me, please."

The small discussion ended in the group of ladies and their two escorts giving Jacqueline Rand
her way, and with laughing good-byes keeping to their course down the street that was now bathed
in the glow of sunset. She watched them for a moment, then turned her face toward her own house.
The distance was short, and she traversed it lightly and rapidly, glad to be alone, glad to
feel upon her brow the sunset wind, and glad at the prospect of her solitary evening. She was
conscious of a strong revulsion of feeling. The sights and the sounds of the past hours were
still in mind, but all the air had changed, and was no longer fevered and boding. She had thought
too much and made too much, she told herself, of that vague and dark "It might have been."
It was not; thank God, it was not! And Lewis, there in Williamsburgh, walking now, perhaps,
down Duke of Gloucester Street, or sitting in the Apollo room at the Raleigh,--would she have
had Lewis read her mind that day? Generous! had she been generous--or just? The colour flowed
over her face and throat. "Neither just nor generous!" she cried to herself, in a passion of
relief. "I'll go no more to that place!"

She reached her own gate, entered between the two box bushes, and mounted the steps to the
honeysuckle-covered porch. The door before her was open, and the hall, wide and cool, with
the tall clock and the long sofa, the portraits on the wall and a great bowl of stock and gillyflower,
brought to her senses a blissful feeling of home, of fixedness and peace.

Mammy Chloe came from the back of the house, and in her mistress's chamber took from her her
straw bonnet, gauze scarf, and filmy gloves, then brought her slippers of morocco and a thin,
flowered house-dress, narrow and fine as an infant's robe.

"Has Joab gone to the post-office?" asked Jacqueline.

"Yaas'm. De Williamsbu'gh stage done come, fer I heah de horn more'n an hour ago. Dar Joab now!"

Mammy Chloe put down the blue china ewer, left the room, and returned with a letter in her
hand. "Dar, now! Marse Lewis ain' neber gwine fergit you! Ef de sun shine, or ef hit don' shine,
heah come de letter jes' de same!"

Jacqueline took the letter from her. "Yes, Mammy, yes," she said, with a sweet and tremulous
laugh. "He's a good master, isn't he?"

"Lawd knows I ain' neber had a better," assented Mammy Chloe. "He powerful stric' to mek you
min', is Marse Lewis, but he am' de kin' what licks he lips ober de fac' dat you is a-mindin'!
I ain' gwine say, honey, an' I neber is gwine say, dat he's wuth what de Churchills is wuth,
but I's ready to survigerate dat he's got he own wuth. An' ef hit's enough fer you, chile,
hit's enough fer yo' ole mammy. Read yo' letter while I puts on yo' slippers."

Jacqueline broke the seal and read:--

     JACQUELINE:--I am kept here for an uncertain time--worse luck, dear
     heart! Do not send what letters may have come for me, as I may
     leave sooner than I think for, and so would pass them on the road.
     Open any from the court in Winchester, where I have a case
     pending--if the matter seems pressing, take a copy, and send copy
     or original to me by to-morrow's stage. I am expecting a letter
     from Washington--an important one, outlining the Embargo measures.
     I looked for it before I left Richmond. If it has arrived, open it,
     dear heart, and glance through it to see if there be any message or
     enquiry which I should have at once. It is very hot, very dusty,
     very tiresome in the court room. I will leave Tom Mocket here to
     wind things up, and will get home as soon as I can. Then, as soon
     as the hurly-burly's over, we'll go to Roselands for a little
     while--to the calm, the peace, bright days and white nights! While
     I write here in the Apollo, you are at church in Saint John's.
     Shall I say, "Pray for me, sweet saint?" You'll do that without my
     asking. So I'll say instead, "Think of me, dear wife, and love me
     still."

     Thine, LEWIS.

Jacqueline stood up in her faintly coloured gown, all rich light and rose bloom. From her dressing-table
she took her keys, and, opening her mother's desk of rosewood and mother-of-pearl, lifted from
it several letters and the packet which Colonel Nicholas had given her the day before. With
these in her hands she left her chamber and went into the drawing-room. "Bring the candles,"
she said over her shoulder to Mammy Chloe. "It is growing too dark to see to read."

CHAPTER XXVII

THE LETTER

The windows were open to the dusky rose of the west, and their long curtains stirred in the
hot and fitful breeze. Jacqueline, waiting for the lights, pushed the heavy hair from her forehead
and panted a little with the oppression of the night. Young Isham entered with the candles,
and Mammy Chloe brought her upon a salver a cup of coffee and a roll. She ate and drank, then
sent her old nurse away. The candles, under their tall glass shades, were upon the centre table,
and beside them lay the letters she was to read. Her husband's own letter was slipped beneath
the ribbon that confined her dress, and lay against her heart.

It was so hot and dull a night that she stood for a while at a window, leaning a little out,
trying to fancy that there was rain in the fantastic mass of clouds that rose on either side
of the evening star. The smell of the box at the gate was strong. She thought of Fontenoy,
of Major Edward, and of Deb. A grey moth touched her; she looked once again at the bright star
between the clouds, then, turning back into the room, drew a chair to the table and, sitting
down, took into her lap the papers that lay beside the candles.

There had come a letter in the stage from Winchester. She opened it. "Could Mr. Rand arrive
by such a day? The case was important--the interests large--the fee large, too. Could he come
just as soon as the jury, the press, and Mr. Jefferson hanged Aaron Burr? An early reply--"

Jacqueline rose, brought writing-materials from the escritoire to the table, and copied rapidly,
in her clear, Italian hand, the Winchester letter, then laid it to one side to be folded with
her own to Lewis for to-morrow's stage to Williamsburgh. The next letter was, she knew, from
Albemarle, and not important. She laid it aside. The third she opened; it was from a gentleman
in Westmoreland who wished in a certain litigation "the services, sir, of the foremost lawyer
in the state." Jacqueline smiled and laid it with the Albemarle letter. The matter might wait
until the foremost lawyer's return. There were now two letters, and neither was from Washington.
One was indeed about matters political, a tirade from a party leader on Rand's folly in declining,
last year, the nomination for Governor, but it contained nothing to demand his instant attention.
The other, which had come by boat from Norfolk, seemed of no consequence.

Jacqueline put both aside, and took into her hand the packet given her by Colonel Nicholas.
She sat for a moment, looking at the superscription. "A letter from Washington," Lewis said,
"outlining the Embargo measures. Open and glance through it to see if there be any message
I should have at once." She thought no otherwise than that this was the letter in question.
Mr. Jefferson was, she knew, upon the defensive in regard to these measures, and she was glad
to believe that he had fallen into an ancient habit and was willing, as of old, to expatiate
upon his policy to Lewis Rand.

She broke the red seals and unfolded the paper. It proved to be a letter covering a letter.
She let fall the folded, inner missive, drew a candle nearer, and read in Jefferson's small,
formal, and very clear hand:--

     I have the honour to restore to you the letter which you will find
     enclosed. If you ask how it came into my hands, I have but to say
     that, in times of crisis and peril, rules of conduct, on the part
     of a government as of an individual, have somewhat to bow to
     necessity. Enough that it did come into my hands--last autumn.
     Judge if I have used it against you! It is now returned to you
     because I no longer conceive it necessary to hold it. I might have
     burned it; I prefer that you shall do so.

     I have but a word to add to our conversation of last August at
     Monticello. I am a man of strong affections. Your youth and all the
     eager service you did me in those years, and the great hopes I had
     for you, endeared you to me. These things are present in my mind.
     Were they not so, you would have heard from me in other wise! Were
     they not so, that which I now enclose should not travel back to the
     writer's hand; it should remain, distinct and black, upon your
     Country's records, for your children's children to read with
     burning cheeks! I spare you, but you are of course aware that the
     affection of which I spoke is dead, dead as the trust with which I
     regarded you, or as the pride with which I dwelt upon your future!
     Reread and destroy that which I place in your hand.

     THOMAS JEFFERSON.

Jacqueline laid down the large, blue, crackling sheet, and took from the floor beside her,
where it had fallen, the President's enclosure. Hand and eye moved mechanically; she neither
thought nor feared. Her judgment was in suspension, and she was unconscious of herself or of
her act. The seals upon this second letter were broken. She unfolded it. On the outside it
was addressed in a hand that, had she thought, she would have recognised for Tom Mocket's,
to an undistinguished person at Marietta upon the Ohio; within, the writing was her husband's
and the address was to Aaron Burr. The date was last August, the subject-matter the disruption
of the Republic and the conquest of Mexico, and the detail of plans included the arrangement
by which Rand was to leave Albemarle, ostensibly to examine a purchase of land beyond the mountains
He would leave, however, not to return. Once out of the country, he with his wife would press
on rapidly to the Ohio, to Blennerhassett's island.

The summer night deepened, hot and languorous, with a sweep of moths to the candle flames,
with vagrant odours of flowering vines and vagrant sounds of distant laughter, voices, footsteps
down the long street. Jacqueline sat very still, the letter in her lap. The curtains at the
window moved in the fitful air. Through the open doors from the kitchen in the yard behind
the house came the strumming of a banjo, then Joab's deep bass:--

     "Go down, go down, Moses,
       Tell Pharaoh let us go!
     Go down, go down, Moses,
       King Pharaoh, let us go!"

There was a wave of honeysuckle, too faint and deadly sweet. A party of men, boatmen or waggoners,
went by, and as they passed, broke into rough laughter.

Jacqueline rose, letting fall the letter. With her hand to her forehead she stood for a minute,
then moved haltingly to the window. Her eyes were blank; she wanted air, she knew, and for
the moment she knew little else. She was whelmed in deep waters, and all horizons were one.
When she reached the casement, she could only cling to the sill, raise her eyes to the stars,
and find nothing there to help her understand. There was in them neither calm nor sublimity;
they swung and danced like insensate fireflies. The honeysuckle was too strong--and she must
tell Joab she did not wish to hear his banjo to-night. The men who had passed were still laughing.

She put her hand again to her forehead, then presently withdrew it and looked over her shoulder
at the paper lying upon the floor beside the table. By degrees the vagueness and the absence
of sensation vanished. She had had her moments of merciful deadening, of indifference to pain;
they were past, and torment now began.

Perhaps half an hour went by. She rose from the sofa upon which she had thrown herself, face
down, pressed her hands to her temples, then, moving to the table, wrote there a word or two,
folded and addressed the paper, and rang the bell. Young Isham appeared and she gave him the
note, bidding him, in a voice that by an effort she made natural, to hasten upon his errand.
When he was gone, she stooped and gathered from the floor the fallen letters--the President's
and Lewis Rand's--and laid them in a drawer. The touch seemed to burn her, for she moaned a
little. She wandered for a moment uncertainly, here and there in the room, then, returning
to the sofa, fell upon her knees beside it, stretched out her arms along the silk, and laid
her head upon them. "O God! O God!" she said, but made no other prayer.

The minutes passed. There was a step, the sound of the gate-latch, and a hand upon the knocker.
She rose from her knees, and was standing by the table when, in another moment, the drawing-room
door opened to admit Ludwell Cary. He came forward.

"You sent for me"--He paused, stepped back, and looked at her fully and gravely. "Something
has happened. Tell me what it is."

"You know. You have known all the time. You knew last summer in the cedar wood!" Her voice
broke; she raised her arms above her head, then let them fall with a cry. "You knew--you knew!"

"How have you come to know? No, don't tell me!"

"I am mad, I think. A letter came that told me. I see now how the world must look to madmen.
It is a curious place where we are all strangers--and yet we think it is our safe home."

As she turned from him, she reeled. There was a great chair near, beside the window. Cary caught
her by both hands, forced her to sit down, and drew the curtains apart so that the air of night
came fully in. The quiet street was now deserted; the maple boughs, too, screened the place.
"Look!" he said. "Look how brightly Venus shines! All the immense rack of clouds that we had
at sunset has vanished. The box smells like the garden at Fontenoy, where, I make no doubt,
Deb and Major Edward are walking up and down, counting the stars. Yes, I knew, that afternoon
in the cedar wood--but not for happiness itself would I have robbed you of that faith, that
confidence--"

She leaned forward in the great chair, her hands clasped upon its arms, her dark eyes wide
upon the night without the window. "I sent for you because I wished you to tell me all. I wanted
truth as I wanted air! I want it now. That day we met in the cedar wood--you and Uncle Edward
talked together." She drew a difficult breath. "It was then that they--Uncle Dick and Uncle
Edward--began to treat me as though--as though I had never left home! It was then--"

"They feared," said Cary gently, "for your happiness."

"I returned to Roselands, and in three days we were to travel across the mountains. Then at
sunset, underneath the beech tree"--She sat for a moment perfectly still, then turned in her
chair and spoke in a clear voice. "That was why you forced him to challenge you, and that was
why you named a distant time and place? The truth, please."

"That was why."

She rose from the chair and leaned, panting, against the window-frame. "Was there no other way--"

"It seemed the simplest way," he answered quietly. "There was no harm done, and it answered
my purpose." He paused, then went on. "My purpose was to detain Mr. Rand from so rash and so
fatal a step until it was too late for him to take it."

She turned from the window. "You are generous," she said, in a stifled voice. "I ask your pardon
for my hard thoughts of you. Oh, for a storm and a wind to blow! It is too hot, too heavy a
night. I never wish to smell the honeysuckle again."

He followed her back to the light of the candles. "Listen to me for a moment. I do not think
that you know--I am not sure that I know--the iron strength of the laws that rule an ambitious
nature. Ambition becomes an atmosphere; the man whose temperament and self-training enure him
to it breathes it at last as though it were his native air. It becomes that--an inner and personal
clime, the source and spring of countless actions, great and small. The light, too, is refracted,
and the great background of life is not seen quite truly. It is, I think, an enchanted air,
into which a man drifts upon a river of dreams and imaginations--and how hard to reascend,
against the current!" He paused, stood a moment with downcast eyes, measuring the table with
his hand, then drew a quick breath and spoke on. "Given his parentage and descent, his unhappy
and hardly-treated boyhood, the visions, the rebellions, the longings with which he must have
walked the hot and rank tobacco-fields; given the upward struggle of his youth, so determined
and so successful; given the courage, the hardihood, the wide outlook of a man who has neither
inherited nor been granted, but has himself hewn out and built up his holding in life; given
genius and sense of power, will, perseverance, and the fatal knowledge that all events and
all currents habitually bend to his hand,--given all this and opportunity"--He raised his head
and met her eyes. "It is not strange and it is not monstrous that Mr. Rand should have involved
himself, to a greater or less degree, in this attempt upon the West. God is my witness, I would
not have you think it strange and monstrous! Ambition is, perhaps, the most human of all qualities.
Many and many an ambitious man has been loved, loved passionately, loved deservedly!--many
a conqueror, many a one of those who failed to conquer and who were called by an ugly name!
Love does not love the ambition, it loves that which is love-worthy below the iron grating
and the tracery of false gold! As the world goes, Lewis Rand and I are enemies; but I could
swear to you to-night that I see, that I have always seen, a greatness in him! I believe it
to be distorted and darkened, but the quality of it is greatness. Were I he"--He paused for
a moment, then continued, with dignity. "Were I he, I would say to the lady who, for love,
had given me her hand in wedlock,--'Love me still. My land is one of storm and darkness, of
rude wastes and frowning strongholds whence sometimes issue robber bands. But it is not a petty
land, and side by side with all that is wrong runs not a little that is heroic and right! Love
me still and help me there, even though--even though I am forsworn to you!"

"I would not have you think," she said clearly,--"I would not have you even lightly dream,
that his country is not my country! I love him!"

"I know that you do."

"There is no place so dark that I would not wait for him there as for the dawn. There is no
flood I would not cross to him; there is no deep pit in which I would not seek him, were he
fallen there! He has done wrong, and I am unhappy for it. But never think, never dream, that,
though I see the dark and broken ground, I would leave that country, or am less than wholly
loyal to its King!"

"I have neither thought nor dreamed it."

"When I--when I learned this thing, it shook me so! My brain whirled, and then I thought of
you and called to you."

"There is no service to which you could call me that I would not thankfully render. I am your
friend and your people's friend. There is one thing more I should like to say to you. Do not
fear for him. There is no reason to believe that this will ever be discovered. The lips of
those who know are sealed."

"Who knows?"

"On our side your uncles, my brother and I,--and your cousin, I think, guesses. The President,
also, is aware--"

She reddened deeply. "I know," she said, in a stifled voice. "The President, too, is generous--"

"On his--on Mr. Rand's side, certain men whom we need not name. That he has secured their silence,
events have proved, and I take it for granted that he has been careful to recall and to destroy
any writing that might incriminate. He is, I think, quite safe."

She turned from him and, sitting down by the table, laid her head upon her arms. He regarded
her for a moment with compassion and understanding, chivalrous and deep, then, moving to the
window, stood there with his face to the evening star. At last she spoke in a broken and tremulous
voice "Mr. Cary--"

He came to her side. "It is a peaceful night, still and bright. You will sleep, will you not?
Leave all this to Time and to the power of steadfast love! You may yet see in this land the
grandeur of the dawn."

"I know that I shall," she answered. "And when I see it, I shall think reverently of you. It
was like you to come, like you to help me so. Now, good-night!"

She took his hand, and before he could prevent her, raised it to her lips. "No,--let me! You
are generous and you are noble. I acknowledge it from my heart. Good-night--good-bye!"

He showed for a moment his pent emotion, then strove with and conquered it. "I will go. Your
cousin is from home, and you are alone to-night. Would you prefer that she should return?"

"No. I had rather be alone."

He took the hand that she gave him, kissed it, and said good-night. When he was gone and his
step had died from the street, she stood for some moments as he had left her, then, with a
sobbing breath, turned to the table and took the letters from the drawer.

CHAPTER XXVIII

RAND AND MOCKET

Tom Mocket, returning to Richmond twenty-four hours after his friend and patron, found it too
late that evening to see Lewis and to report the happy winding up of all matters in Williamsburgh.
The next morning he was at the office betimes, but though he waited long, no Lewis appeared.
At last Tom sent a boy to the house on Shockoe, who returned with the statement that Mr. Rand
was gone to the Capitol. "Then I'll go too," thought Tom. "I've got nerve as well as he!"

It was the fourth day of the actual trial, and interest was at white heat. Tom whistled to
himself as he crossed the Capitol Square where men blocked the paths or, on the grass beneath
the trees, recounted, disputed, and prophesied. When he reached the building, it was with much
difficulty that he effected an entrance, and with more that he at last edged himself into the
Hall of the House of Delegates. Sturdy perseverance and an acquaintance with a doorkeeper,
however, can accomplish much, and these finally placed Mocket where, by dint of balancing himself
upon an advantageous ledge of masonry, he had a fair view of both participants and spectators.

General William Eaton was being examined. The throng sat or stood silently attentive, swayed
forward as by a wind. Marshall upon the bench, long and loose-jointed, with a quiet, plain
face, was listening with intentness; the opposing counsel sat alert, gathered for the pounce;
the prisoner, with a contemptuous smile, regarded the witness, who indeed cut but a poor figure.
The District Attorney's voice, deliberate and full, asked a question, and General Eaton proceeded
to give in detail Colonel Burr's expression of treasonable intentions.

Mocket, who had at first looked and listened with a thumping heart and a strong feeling that,
visible to all, the letter T might be somewhere sewn or branded upon his own person, by degrees
grew bolder. There wasn't any letter there, that was certain, and a slight sense of personal
danger might even become a welcome sauce to such a great affair as this! His fright vanished,
and his ferret eyes began to rove.

There was Adam Gaudylock, still with his musket. It was a day when men habitually journeyed
with pistols in their holsters or a dirk somewhere about them, but Adam carried that musket
merely because he loved it--like a dog or a woman! Tawny and blue-eyed, light and lithe, indifferent
and pleased to see the show, the hunter listened to General Eaton and laughed behind his hand
to a fellow woodsman. "My certie, he's trained!" thought Tom. "It's not much they'll get from him!"

His eyes left Adam and travelled in search of Lewis Rand, finding him at last where he sat
at no great distance from the group of central importance. His face was turned in Mocket's
direction, and the light from a high window fell upon it. "He doesn't see me," thought Tom
to himself. "Who's he looking at like that?"

The witness's voice, raised by suggestion of counsel to a higher note, came athwart Mocket's
speculations. "I listened to Colonel Burr's mode of indemnity; and as I had by this time begun
to suspect that the military expedition he had on foot was unlawful, I permitted him to believe
myself resigned to his influence, that I might understand the extent and motive of his arrangements.
Colonel Burr now laid open his project of revolutionizing the territory west of the Alleghany;
establishing an independent empire there; New Orleans to be the capital, and he himself to
be the chief; organizing a military force on the waters of the Mississippi, and carrying conquest
to Mexico--"

On went Eaton's disclosures, punctuated by heated objections from Wickham and Luther Martin,
and once or twice by a scornful question from Burr himself. It was damning testimony, and the
throng hung breathless on the various voices. Mocket listened also, but listened with his eyes
upon his chief, and when there arose some interruption and dispute over technicalities, his
freed mind proceeded to deal with Rand's change of aspect. It occurred to him to wonder if
the light which showed it to him could be falling through a veil of storm cloud, but when he
glanced at the high window, there was only the blue August heaven. What, then, gave Lewis so
dark a look? "The black dog he talks of has got him sure," thought Tom. "What's happened to
anger him like that?"

The voice of the witness again made itself heard. "Colonel Burr stated that he had secured
to his interests and attached to his person the most distinguished citizens of Tennessee, Kentucky,
and the territory of Orleans; that the army of the United States would act with him; that it
would be reinforced by ten or twelve thousand men from the above states and territories, and
that he had powerful agents in the Spanish territory. He proposed to give me a distinguished
command in his army; I understood him to say the second in command. I asked him who would command
in chief. He said, General Wilkinson. I said that General Wilkinson would act as lieutenant
to no man in existence. 'You are in error,' said Mr. Burr. 'Wilkinson will act as lieutenant
to me--'"

Mocket moved with care along the ledge until he had brought within his view another portion
of the Hall. "That look of his isn't fixed on nothing! Now we'll see." He stood on tiptoe,
craned his neck, and surveyed the crowded floor. "Humph!" he remarked at last. "I might have
known without looking. If I were Ludwell Cary--"

The counsel for the prisoner and the prisoner himself were subjecting the witness to a riddling
fire of cross-questions. Mocket, on his coign of vantage, was caught again by the more apparent
drama, and looked and listened greedily. Eaton at last retired, much damaged, and Commodore
Truxtun was sworn. This was a man of different calibre, and from side to side of the long room
occurred a subtle intensification of respect, interest, and attention. On went the examination,
this time favourable, on the whole, to Burr. "The prisoner frequently, in conversation with
me, mentioned the subject of speculations in western lands, opening a canal and building a
bridge. Colonel Burr also said to me that the government was weak, and that he wished me to
get the navy of the United States out of my head; that it would dwindle to nothing; and that
he had something to propose to me that was both honourable and profitable; but I considered
this nothing more than an interest in his land speculations--"

The August heat was maddening. Now and then a puff of wind entered from the parched out-of-doors,
but it hardly refreshed. The flutter of the women's fans in the gallery made a far away and
ineffectual sound. "All his conversations respecting military and naval subjects and the Mexican
expedition," went on Truxtun's voice, "were in event of a war with Spain. I told him my opinion
was, there would be no war, but he was sanguine of it. He said that after the Mexican expedition
he intended to provide a formidable navy; that he meant to establish an independent government
and give liberty to an enslaved world. I declined his propositions to me because the President
was not privy to the project. He asked me the best mode of attacking the Havana, Carthagena,
and La Vera Cruz--"

The day wore on. Truxtun was released, and the Attorney for the United States called Blennerhassett's
servants to prove the array at the island and the embarkment upon the Ohio. They did their
best with a deal of verbiage, of "Colonel Burr said" and "Mr. Blennerhassett said," and with
no little bewilderment under cross-examination. "Yes, sir; I'm telling you, sir. Mr. Blennerhassett
allowed that Colonel Burr and he and a few friends had bought eight hundred thousand acres
of land, and they wanted young men to settle it. He said he would give any young man who would
go down the river one hundred acres of land, plenty of grog and victuals while going down the
river, and three months' provision after they got to the end; every young man must have his
rifle and blanket. When I got home, I began to think, and I asked him what kind of seed we
should carry with us. He said we did not want any, the people had seeds where we were going--"

"Of what occupation were you upon the island?" demanded Mr. Wirt.

"A gardener, sir. And then Mr. Blennerhassett said to me, 'I'll tell you what, Peter, we're
going to take Mexico, one of the finest and richest places in the world!' He said that Colonel
Burr would be King of Mexico, and that Mrs. Alston, daughter of Colonel Burr, was to be the
Queen of Mexico whenever Colonel Burr died. He said that Colonel Burr had made fortunes for
many in his time, but none for himself, and now he was going to make something for himself.
He said that he had a great many friends in the Spanish territory; that the Spaniards, like
the French, had got dissatisfied with their government, and wanted to swap it. He told me that
the British also were friends in this piece of business. I told him that the people had got
it into their heads that Colonel Burr wanted to divide the Union. He sent me to Mason County
with a letter, but I wasn't to deliver it until I had the promise that it should be burned
before me as soon as 't was read, for, says he, it contains high treason."

"Gad!" thought Mocket to himself, "I'm glad that some one else's letters are burned as well!
If I were as cool as Aaron Burr looks--"

Mr. McRae questioned the witness: "Well, who went off this December night?"

"Mr. Blennerhassett, sir, and the whole of the party."

"At what time of the night?"

"About one o'clock."

"Did all that came down to the island go away?"

"All but one, who was sick."

"Had they any guns?"

"Some of them had. Some of the people went a-shooting; but I do not know how many there were."

"What kind of guns; rifles or muskets?"

"I can't tell whether rifles or muskets. I saw no pistols but what belonged to Mr. Blennerhassett
himself."

"Was there any powder or lead?"

"They had powder and they had lead. I saw some powder in a long, small barrel like a churn.
Some of the men were engaged in running bullets."

"What induced them to leave the island at that hour of the night?"

"Because they were informed that the Kenawha militia were coming down."

The cross-examination of this witness and some desultory firing by the opposed counsel ended
the day's proceedings. The court adjourned, and the crowd streamed forth to the open air. Mocket,
among the first to leave the hail, waited for his chief beside the outer doors. Townspeople,
country neighbours, and strangers poured by, and he spoke to this one or to that. A group of
Federalists approached; among them Ludwell Cary. They were talking, and as they passed Mocket
heard the words, "When I return to Albemarle next week--" They went on down the steps; others
streamed by, and presently Rand appeared. His lieutenant joined him, and together they left
the Capitol and struck down the parched slopes to Governor Street.

"Things are all right at Williamsburgh," ventured Mocket, finding the silence oppressive. "I
got in too late to see you last night. Were you at the Capitol yesterday also?"

"Yes."

"A man told me they had Adam on the stand. They got nothing from him?"

"Nothing."

"I've the papers all straight for the Winchester case. What do you want me to do--"

"I want you to be silent."

The other glanced aslant, with a lift of his brows and a twist of his lip. "That's a black
rage," he thought; "Gideon and old Stephen and the Lord knows who beside all speaking together!"

They left Governor Street and presently arrived in silence before Rand's office. Mocket unlocked
the door and they went in together. The senior partner dragged a chair before the empty fireplace
and, sitting down, stared at the discoloured bricks as though he saw vistas through the wail.
Tom worked among the papers on his desk, moving his fingers noiselessly, and now and then glancing
over his shoulder. The clock on the wall ticked loudly.

Rand spoke at last His voice had a curious suppressed tone, and upon his forehead, between
the eyes, was displayed the horseshoe frown of extreme anger. Mocket had seen it earlier in
the day, and it was now distinct as a brand. "I am not going," he said, "to take the Winchester
case. This damned business here will soon be over. I shall wait to hear the verdict, and then
I'm going to Albemarle."

"What d'ye think the verdict will be?"

"They'll acquit him. Barring Wirt, he has all the talent on his side. I'll leave you here to
clear up things."

"Does Mrs. Rand wait here for you?"

"No. She leaves Richmond with Miss Dandridge to-morrow."

Tom took out his knife and began to whittle, an occupation that in him denoted sustained mental
exertion. The other sat on before the empty fireplace, the mark upon his forehead, his hand
twitching where it lay upon the arm of his chair. The clock ticked loudly; the sun, now low
in the heavens, sent its gold shafts through the window; outside, the locusts shrilled in a
dusty sycamore. Rand rose and, going to the cupboard, took from it a bottle and a glass, poured
out brandy for himself, and drank it. In an age of hard drinking he was accounted puritanically
abstemious. Mocket, glancing after him, knew that the draught meant disturbance so deep that
the organism needed, rather than craved, the strength within the glass. Rand came back to the
fireplace.

"Do you remember when, in November, I burned here, or thought I burned here, all papers, all
letters--"

"Do I?" asked Mocket, with emphasis. "There's nothing happened to make me forget."

"A man cannot weave a net so fine that some minnow will not slip through and become leviathan!
It escaped and has grown. Well, that too was in the nature of things." He took the ash-stick
from the corner of the hearth and handled it as though he were again holding down burning papers.
"So things are all right at Williamsburgh? I had a happy home-coming."

"You always have that," said Tom simply. "You've had a wonderful fortune, and more there than
anywhere. I'm always telling Vinie--"

"Vinie!" answered the other. "Vinie would always blindly worship on. The sun might darken and
go out, but where's the odds since she would never know it! Faith like a dog's or a child's
or Vinie's--there's comfort there! But the awakened mind, and Judgment side by side upon the
throne with Love--Oh, there's verjuice in the world!" He broke into harsh laughter.

"I wish I knew what ailed you," thought Mocket. "I'll try another tack." He stopped whittling
and turned from his desk. "Coming out of the Capitol, I heard Ludwell Cary say that he goes
next week to Albemarle."

"It is indifferent to me," replied the other, "whether he goes or stays." His hands closed
upon the ash-stick until his nails were white. Suddenly he spoke without apparent relevance.
"He is one of those men who are summoned in time of trouble--when the mind is tossed and the
heart is wavering. They always answer--they come down the street at night, between the box
bushes, up the steps beneath the honeysuckle--on such an errand they would not fear the lion's
den! They are magnanimous, they are generous, they are out of our old life, they can tell us
what we ought to do!" He struck the ash-stick violently against the hearth. "Honeysuckle and
box and the quiet of the night, and 'Yes, I knew, I knew. 'Twas thus and so, and I would counsel
you--' Oh, world's end and hell-fire! forgiveness itself grows worthless on such terms!"

He threw the stick from him, rose abruptly, and walked to the window.

"The clouds pile up, but they do not break, and the heat and fever of this August air grow
intolerable. To abstract the mind--to abstract the mind"--He stood listening to the locusts
and all the indefinable hum of the downward-drawing afternoon, then turned to Tom. "Give me
those Winchester papers. Now what, exactly, did you do in Williamsburgh?"

CHAPTER XXIX

THE RIVER ROAD

The days of speeches, for the Government and for Aaron Burr,--Hay, Wirt, and McRae against
Edmund Randolph, Wickham, Botts, Lee, and Luther Martin,--went crackling by with bursts of
heavy artillery and with running fire of musketry. It was a day of orators, and eloquence was
spilled like water. At last the case rested. The Chief Justice summed up, exhaustively, with
extraordinary ability, and with all the impartiality humanly possible to a Federalist Chief
Justice dealing with a Republican prosecution. The jury, as is known, brought in a Scotch verdict,
whereupon the prisoner was immediately upon his feet with a vehement protest. Finally the "Not
proven" was expunged from the record, and Aaron Burr stood "Acquitted." The famous trial for
treason was over.

As, throughout the summer, all roads led to Richmond, now, in the fierce heat and dust of early
autumn, there was an exodus which left the town extremely dull after all the stir and fascination
of the Government's proceedings. Burr, indeed, discharged for treason, was still held in bail
to answer for the misdemeanor, judges and lawyers were still occupied, and many witnesses yet
detained. But the result of the matter was a foregone conclusion. Here, too, there would be
a "Not proven," with a demand on the part of the accused for a "Not guilty," and a final direction
by the judges to the jury to return a verdict in the usual form. The trial of a man for a misdemeanor
in levying war with Spain--a misdemeanor which, if proved, could entail only imprisonment--was
an infinitely less affair than a prosecution for high treason, with the penalty of an ignominious
death suspended like a sword of Damocles. The little world in Richmond felt the subsidence
of excitement, realized how warm and dusty was the town, and began to think of its plantations
and of country business. Witnesses and visitors of note took the homeward road. The Swan, the
Eagle, the Bell, the Indian Queen, crowded all the summer, saw their patrons depart by stage,
by boat, in coach and chaise, and on horseback. Many private houses were closed, and the quiet
of the doldrums fell upon the place.

Jacqueline and Unity had been ten days in Albemarle. The two Carys, a servant behind them with
their portmanteaus, rode away from the Swan on the first day of September. It was understood
between the brothers that they were to make all haste to Greenwood. But there were houses on
the way where kinsmen and friends might be trusted to do what they could to detain the two.
Both were anxious to be at home--Fairfax the more eager, as was natural. The marriage was set
for the middle of the month. As they rode out of town he had begun with, "I'll see her in four
days," and the next morning, passing through the gates of the plantation where they had slept,
he had irrelevantly remarked, "Now it is but three." The elder brother laughed and wished him
Houssain's carpet.

Throughout the day they rode as rapidly as the heat permitted, but when at dusk they were captured
by a kinsman with a charming wife and a bevy of pretty daughters, it was evident that they
would not resume the road at dawn. It was noon, indeed, before they unclasped all these tendrils
and pursued their journey, and at sunset another plantation put out a detaining hand. Fairfax
Cary swore with impatience. The other laughed again, but when, late next morning, they got
away with a message called to them from the porch, "You'll be at Elm Tree this afternoon. Tell
Cousin William--" he looked kindly at his junior's vexed face and proposed a division of forces.

"We can't neglect Elm Tree, and then there's Cherry Hill and Malplaquet still before us. Why
shouldn't you just speak to them at Elm Tree, then ride on to the inn at Deer Lick and sleep
there to-night? You could start with the first light, ride around Cherry Hill, and give Malplaquet
the slip. I'll make your excuses everywhere. It's hard if a man can't be forgiven something--when
he's on the eve of marrying Unity Dandridge! You'll be at Greenwood to-morrow night, and I
dare say they'll ask you to breakfast at Fontenoy. Come, there's a solution!"

"You're the best fellow! And what will you do?"

"I'll sleep to-night at Elm Tree and ride soberly on to-morrow, take dinner at Cherry Hill,
and sleep again at Malplaquet. They'll all be disappointed at not seeing the prospective bridegroom,
but I'll make them understand that a man in love can't travel like a tortoise! I'll ride from
Malplaquet by the river road and be at home that afternoon. You had better take Eli with you."

They rode together to Elm Tree, and parted under these conditions.

Lewis Rand left Richmond on the third of September. He travelled rapidly. There were no kinsmen
to detain him on the road, and while he had hot partisans and was not without friends, there
was not within him the Virginian instinct to loiter among these last, finding the flower in
the moment, and resolutely putting off the morrow. His quest was for the morrow.

He rode now in the hot September weather, by field and forest, hill and dale and stream, and
rested only when he would spare the horses. Young Isham was with him; Joab had been sent on
with Jacqueline. When night fell, he drew rein at the nearest house. If he knew the people,
well; if he did not know them, well still; on both sides acquaintance would be enlarged. Hospitality
was a Virginian virtue; no one ever dreamed of being unwelcome because he was a stranger. In
the morning, after thanks and proffers of all possible service, he took the road again. It
was his purpose to make the journey, despite the heat, in three days.

The last night upon the road he spent at a small tavern hard by an important crossroads. It
was twilight when he dismounted, the fireflies thick in the oak scrub and up and down the pale
roads, a crescent moon in the sky, and from somewhere the sound of wind in the pine-tops. Young
Isham and the hostler took away the horses, and Rand, mounting the steps to the porch, found
lounging there the inn's usual half-dozen haphazard guests. To most of these he was known by
sight, to all by name, and as, with a "Good-evening, gentlemen!" he passed into the low, whitewashed
main room, he left behind him more animation than he had found. When, a little later, he went
into the supper-room, he discovered at table, making heavy inroads upon the bacon and waffles,
an old acquaintance--Mr. Ned Hunter.

"Mr. Hunter, good-evening."

"Hey--what--the Devil! Good-evening to you, Mr. Rand. So, after all, your party, sir, didn't
hang Colonel Burr!"

The two ate supper with the long table between them, and with no great amiability of feeling
in presence. The Republican was the first to end the meal, and the Federalist answered his
short bow with an even more abbreviated salute. Rand went out into the porch, where there were
now only one or two lounging figures, and sat down at the head of the steps. Mr. Hunter came
presently, too, into the air, and leaned against the railing, whistling to the dogs in the yard.

"You are going on in the morning, Mr. Rand?"

"Yes. At dawn."

"You'll be in Charlottesville, then, by two o'clock. Earlier, if you take the river road."

"I shall take the river road."

"It is broken riding, but it is the quickest way. Well, I won't be many hours behind you! My
humble regards, if you please, to Mrs. Rand. There's nothing now at Fontenoy but wedding talk.
I am sure I hope Miss Dandridge may be happy! Here, Di! here, Rover! here, Vixen!"

Rand arose. "I've had a long day and I make an early start. Good-night to you, gentlemen!"

When, in the morning, Young Isham came to his door with the first light, the boy found his
master already up and partly dressed. Rand stood by the window looking out at the pink sky.
"A bad night, Young Isham," he said, without turning. "Sleep's a commodity that has somehow
run short with me. Are the horses ready?"

"Yaas, marster."

"Have you had your breakfast?"

"Yaas, marster."

"Help me here, then, and let's away. Roselands by one!"

Young Isham held the gilt-buttoned waistcoat, then took from the dresser the extravagant neckcloth
of the period, and wound it with care around his master's throat. Rand knotted the muslin in
front, put on his green riding-coat, and took from the dresser his watch and seals. "Bah! there's
a chill in these September dawns! Close the portmanteau. Where did you put the holsters?"

"Dar dey is, sah, under yo' han'."

The boy, on his knees, worked at the straps of the portmanteau. Rand, waiting for him to finish,
drew out a pistol from its leather case, looked it over and replaced it, then did the same
with its fellow. "Are you done?" he said at last. "Bring everything and come on. I'll swallow
a cup of coffee and then we'll be gone. We should pass Malplaquet by nine."

They rode away from the half-awakened inn. A mist was over the fields, and when they presently
came to a stretch of forest, the leaves on either hand were wet. The grey filled arcades and
hollows, and the note of the birds was as yet sleepy and without joyousness. They left the
woods and, mounting a hill, saw from its summit the sun rise in splendour, then dipped again
into fields where from moment to moment the gold encroached. They rode rapidly in the freshness
of the morning, by wood and field and stream, so rapidly that it was hardly nine when they
passed a brick house with pillars set on a hill-top in a grove of oaks. Rand looked at it fixedly
as he rode by. Malplaquet was a Cary place, and it had an air of Greenwood.

Three miles further on, sunk in elder and pokeberry and shaded by a ragged willow, there appeared
a wayside forge. The blacksmith was at work, and the clink, clink of iron made a cheerful sound.
Rand drew rein. "Good-morning, Jack Forrest. Have a look, will you, at this shoe of Selim's."

The smith stooped and looked. "I'll give him a new one in a twinkling, Mr. Rand! From Richmond,
sir?"

"Yes; from Richmond."

"Burr got off, didn't he? If the jury'd been from this county, we'd have hanged him sure! Splitting
the country into kindling wood, and stirring up a yellow jacket's nest of Spaniards, and corrupting
honest men! If they won't hang him, then tar and feathers, say I! Soh, Selim! You've been riding
hard, sir."

"Yes. I wanted to be at home."

"'Tis mortal weather. When September's hot, it lays over July. We'll have a storm this afternoon,
I'm thinking. There's a deal of travel despite the heat, and I'm not complaining of business.
Mr. Cary of Greenwood is just ahead of you. There, sir, that's done!"

The smith arose, patted Selim on the shoulder, and stood back. "You've got a fine horse, Mr.
Rand, and that's certain. By Meteor, ain't he, out of Fatima?"

"Yes. Which of the Carys did you say--"

"Ludwell Cary. He came from Malplaquet and rode by an hour ago. The other passed yesterday--"

"Did Mr. Cary say which road he would take at the ford?"

"No, he didn't. The main road, though, I reckon. The river road's bad just now, and he seemed
to have time before him. Thankee, Mr. Rand, and good-day to you!"

Followed by Young isham, Rand travelled on by the dusty road, between the parching elder and
ironweed, blackberry and love vine. There was dust upon the wayside cedars, and the many locust
trees let fall their small yellow leaves. As the sun mounted the heat increased, and with it
the interminable, monotonous, and trying zirr, zirr, of the underworld on blade and bush. He
rode with a dark face, and with lines of anger between his brows. It had come to him like a
chance spark to a mine that Ludwell Cary was not at Greenwood, was yet upon the road before
him. He knew day and hour when the other had left Richmond, and there had been more than time
to make his journey.

Before him, on the lower ground, a belt of high and deep woods proclaimed a watercourse, and
he presently arrived beside a shrunken stream. Here was a mill, and the miller and a man or
two were apparent in the doorway. The ford lay a hundred yards beyond, and on the far side
of the stream the river road and the main road branched. Travellers paused as a matter of course
to give and take the time of day, and now the miller, dusty and white, came out into the road.
"Morning, morning, Mr. Rand! From Richmond, sir? So we couldn't hang Aaron Burr, after all.
Well, he ought to have been, that's all I've got to say!"

"Give me a gourd of water, will you, Bates? This dust is choking."

"'Tis that, sir. But we'll have a storm before the day is over. There's a deal of travel just
now. Mr. Cary of Greenwood passed a short while ago."

A negro brought a dripping gourd. Rand put it to his lips and drank the cool water. "Which
road," he asked, as he gave back the gourd,--"which road did Mr. Cary take? The main road or
the river road?"

The miller looked over his shoulder. "Jim and Bob and Shirley, which road did Mr. Cary take?"

"I didn't notice."

"Reckon he took the main road, Bates."

"I wasn't looking, but you could hear his horse's hoofs, and that wouldn't have been so on
the river road."

"'Twuz de main road, sah."

Rand and Young Isham went on, down by the mill and along the bank to the clear, brown, shallow
ford, crossed, and paused beneath a guide-post upon the crest of the further bank. The trees
hid the mill. Before them stretched the main road, to the right dipped between fern and under
arching boughs the narrow, broken river road. "If he went this way," said Rand slowly, "I'll
go that. Young Isham--"

"Yaas, marster."

"The mare's spent. No need to give her this rough travelling. Take the main road and take it
slowly. Let her walk, and when you reach Red Fields, stop and have her fed. I'll go and go
fast by the river road."

Master and slave parted, the latter keeping to the sunny thoroughfare, the former plunging
into the narrow, heavily shaded track that ran through ravine and over ridge, now beside the
water and now in close woods of birch and hemlock. The road was bad, but Selim and his master
bent to it grimly, with no nice avoidance of rut or stone or sunken place. To the horse there
was before him food and rest, to the man his home. They took at the same pace the much of rough
and the little of smooth, and the miles fell behind them. The sun was high, but there were
threatening masses of clouds, with now and then a distant roll of thunder. The road was solitary,
little used at any time, and to-day as lonely a woodland way as might well be conceived.

Rand rode with closed lips, and with the mark between his brows. Passion was having its way
with him, such passion as had lived with him, now drowsing, now fiercely awake, in the days
at Richmond between his return from Williamsburgh and the close of the trial. He saw Roselands
and Jacqueline beneath the beech tree, but he also saw, and that with more distinctness, the
face and form of the man who rode toward Greenwood. He longed for Jacqueline, but he had not
forgiven her. He knew that he would when he saw her face--would forgive her with a cry for
the waste of the hot, revengeful days, the sleepless nights, since they had parted. Her face
swam before him, between the hemlock boughs, but he was not ready yet to forgive, not yet,
not until he got to Roselands and she met him with her wistful eyes! He was not a fool; the
Absolute within him knew where lay the need for forgiveness, but it was deeply overlaid with
human pride and wrath. He was at the old, old trick of anger with another when the fault was
all his own. As for Ludwell Cary--

His hand closed with force upon the bridle and his eyes narrowed. "From the first, from that
day upon the Justice's Bench, from that day when we gathered nuts together, I must have hated.
Now it is warp and woof, warp and woof!" He touched Selim with the spur. "If there were truly
a heaven and truly a hell, and I, in flames myself, saw him in Abraham's bosom, not to escape
from that torment would I call to him, 'Once we were neighbours, once it seemed that we might
have been friends--come down, come down and help me, Cary!'"

He laughed, a harsh sound that came back from the rock above him. By no means always, far from
even often, a hardened or an evil man, to-day the stream of thought was stirred and sullied
from every black pool and weedy depth, and there came floating up folly, waste, and sin. His
reason slept. Had he, by some Inquisitor not to be disobeyed, been suddenly obliged to give
why and wherefore for his hatred, the trained intellect must have agreed with the questioner.
"These causes fail of sufficiency." That was true, but the truth was sophistry. He dealt now
with the fact that he hated, and in his mind, as he rode at speed along the river road, he
did not even review the past which had given birth to this present. He hated, and his hand
closed upon the rein within it as though there was there, in addition, another thread.

A hemlock bough brushed violently against his face. He struck it aside, and, coming to the
rocky top of a little rise, checked Selim for a moment of the fresher air. It came like a sigh
from the darkening clouds. Rand looked out over field and forest to the massed horizon, then
shook the reins, and Selim picked his way down the ridge to a woodland bottom through which
flowed a stream. Rand heard the ripple of the water. A jutting boulder, crowned by a mountain
ash, hid the road before him; he turned it and saw the stream, some yards away, flowing over
mossed rocks and beneath a dark fringe of laurel. He saw more than the stream, for a horseman
had paused upon the little rocky strand, and, hearing hoofs behind him, had partly turned his
own steed. Rand's hand dragged at the bridle-rein and Selim stood still.

For a moment the two men, so suddenly confronted, sat their horses and stared at each other.
Between them was a narrow rocky space, about Rand a heavy frame of leaves, behind Cary the
clear flowing stream. Above the treetops the mounting clouds were dark, but the sun rode hot
and high in a round of unflecked azure. The silence held for a heartbeat, then Rand spoke thickly:
"So you, too, took the river road?"

"Yes. It is rough but short. When did you leave Richmond?"

"As soon as I could. You would have been better pleased, would you not, had I never left it?
In your opinion, I should be in durance there, laid by the heels with Aaron Burr!"

"You are not yourself, Mr. Rand."

"Do not push innocence upon the board! When did it begin, your deep interest in my concerns?
Before the world was made, I think, for always we have been at odds. But this--this especial
matter, Ludwell Cary, this began with the letter which you wrote and signed 'Aurelius'!"

"A letter that told the truth, Mr. Rand."

"That is as may be. Telling the truth is at times an occupation full of danger."

"Is it?"

"The nineteenth of February--ah, I have you there! Was it not--was it not a pleasant employment
for a snowy night to sit by the fire and learn news of an enemy--news the more piquant for
the lips that gave it!"

"You are speaking, sir, both madly and falsely!"

They pressed their horses more closely together. Cary was pale with anger, but upon Rand's
face was a curious darkness. Men had seen Gideon look so, and in old Stephen Rand the peculiarity
had been marked. When he spoke, it was in a voice that matched his aspect. "Last October in
the Charlottesville court room--even that insult was not insult merely, but a trap as well!
It is to be acknowledged that yours was the master mind. I walked into your trap."

"That which I did is not to be called a trap. Your ambition enmeshed you then, as your passion
blinds you now."

Rand's voice darkened and fell. "Who gave you--who gave you the right of inquisition? What
has your soul or your way of thinking to do with mine? You are not my keeper. I would not take
salvation at your hands--by God, no! Why should the thought of you lie at the bottom of each
day? It shall not lie at the bottom of this one! I do not know where first we met, but now
we'll part. You have laid your finger here and you have laid it there, now take your hand away!"

"Do you well, and I will," said Cary sternly.

The other drew a labouring breath. "Two weeks ago I was in Williamsburgh, in the Apollo, listening
in the heat to idle talk--and you in Richmond, you came at her call! You came down the quiet
street, and in between the box bushes, and up the steps under the honeysuckle. What did you
say to her there in the dusk, by the window? You were a Cary--you were part and parcel of the
loved past--you had all the shibboleths--you could comfort, commiserate, and counsel! Ha! I
wish I might have heard. 'Aurelius' dealing with the forsworn and the absent! 'Here the blot,
and there the stain, and yon a rent that's hard to mend. If there's salvation, I see it not
at present.' So you resolved all her doubts, and laid within her hand every link of a long
chain. You have my thanks."

"I will not," said Cary, after a silence,--"I will not be moved by you now, and I will not
talk with you now. You are beside yourself. I will say good-day to you, Mr. Rand, and in a
less passionate hour I will tell you that you have judged me wrongly."

He gathered up his reins and slightly turned his horse. It had been wiser to break into violent
speech, or even to deal the other a blow. As it was, the very restraint of his action was spark
to gunpowder. Rand's hand fell to a holster, drew and raised a pistol. Cary saw and flung out
his arm, swerving his horse, but too late. There was a flash and a report. The reins dropped
from Cary's grasp; he sank forward upon his horse's neck, then, while the terrified animal
reared and plunged, fell heavily to earth and lay beside the stream with a ball through his heart.

CHAPTER XXX

HOMEWARD

The frightened birds rose in numbers from the forest trees. Cary's horse, with a snort of terror,
reared and turned. Rand flung himself from Selim and dashed forward to the black's bridle,
but he was too late. The horse clattered down the little strand, plunged into the flashing
water, and in another moment reached the opposite bank and tore away along the river road.

The sound of hoofs died away. All sound seemed to die, that of the stream, of the birds, of
the air in the trees. It was as still as the desert. Very quietly and subtly the outward world
put itself in accord with the inward; never again would sky or earth, tree or leaf or crystal
water, be what it was an hour ago. Life and the scenery of life had a new aspect.

The murderer moved to the side of the murdered, knelt stiffly, and laid his hand upon the heart.
It, too, was still. Rand stood up. The pistol was yet in his clasp; he swung his arm above
his head and hurled the weapon into the stream. A pace or two away was a smooth and rounded
rock like a giant pebble. He sat down upon it, locked his hands, and looked about him. The
sky was blue, the leaves were green, the sun shone hot, the water was at its ancient song--whence,
then, came the noxious change, and what was the matter with the universe? Cary lay among the
stones, with head thrown back and one arm stretched out as though the hand were pointing. The
face was quiet, set in the icy beauty of death, and young. There came a roll of thunder. Rand
looked at his clasped hands, opened them, and moved the right one slightly to and fro. There
was blood upon his coatsleeve--a great smear. He drew a sighing breath. He felt as a voyager
might who awakened on a planet not his own and at midnight saw the faint star where once he
lived. As yet the wonder numbed. The complete cessation of anger, too, was confusing. There
was only the plane of existence, grey and featureless. This lasted some moments, then the lights
began to play.

He rose from the stone and, going to the water's edge, knelt and tried to wash the blood from
his sleeve, but without success. He stood up with a frown. The clouds were high above the treetops,
though the sun yet shone. At a little distance Selim was quietly grazing, the birds had returned
to their song, the squirrels to their play along the leafy boughs. Rand looked at his watch.
"Twelve o'clock--twelve o'clock." Suddenly a thought struck him. "The pistol, with my name
engraved on it--"

He had flung the weapon far into the water. The stream was hardly more than a wide brook, but
its bed was broken, and above and below the little ford the water fell over ledges into small,
deep pools. Where had the pistol fallen? If into one of these, he could not find it again.
He had no time to sound them one by one. He moved along the bank, his keen eyes searching the
water. The pistol was nowhere visible; it must have gone into midstream, into a pool below
a cascade. If so, it might lie there, undiscovered, a thousand years. He stood irresolute.
Could he have done so, he would have dragged the stream, but there was now no time to squander.
Once more he made certain that it lay nowhere in clear water or near the shore, then abruptly
left the search.

He stood in thought for another moment, then with deliberation moved to his victim's side and
looked down upon him with a face almost as blank and still as the dead man's own. Presently
he spoke: "Good-bye, Cary." The sound of his own voice, strained and strange, hardly raised
above a whisper and yet, in the silence of this new world, more loud than thunder, broke the
spell. He uttered a strangled cry, dashed up the strand to the grazing horse, flung himself
into the saddle, and applied the spur.

He and Selim did not cross the stream. His mind worked automatically, but it was a trained
mind, and knew what the emergency demanded. He retraced the river road to a point beyond the
rock and the mountain ash, and there left it. Once in the burned herbage under the trees, he
looked back to the road. There was rock and there was black leaf-mould. If in the latter any
hoof-prints showed confusedly, the coming storm held promise of a pelting and obliterating
rain. He pushed into a thick-set wood, and began a desperate ride across country. It was necessary
to strike the main road below Red Fields.

Their way was now dangerous enough, but he and Selim made no stay for that. They went at speed
over stock and stone, between resinous pines, through sumach and sassafras. Lightnings were
beginning to play, and the thunder to roll more loudly. The sunbeams were gone, the trees without
motion, the air hot and laden. Horse and man panted on. Rand's mind made swift calculation.
He had ordered Young Isham to walk the mare. For all that time had seemed to stop, there at
the stream behind him, the minutes were no longer than other minutes, and there had passed
of them no great number. He had ridden from the ford to the stream at speed, and now he was
going as rapidly. He would presently reach the main road, and Young Isham would not have passed.

It fell as he had foreseen. One last burst through brush and vine and scrub and they reached
the edge of the wood. Before them through the trees he saw the main road. Rand checked the
horse. "Stand a bit, Selim, while I play the scout."

Dismounting, he moved with caution through a mass of dogwood and laurel to the bank. At a distance
beneath him lay the road, bare under the storm clouds. Above and below where he stood it was
visible for some rods, and upon it appeared neither man nor beast. He went back to Selim, mounted,
and together they made shift to descend the red bank. As, with a noise of breaking twigs and
falling earth and stone, they reached the road, a man, hitherto hidden by the giant bole of
the oak beneath which he had sat down to rest, rose and came round his tree to see what made
the commotion. Between the cause and the investigator was perhaps fifty feet of road. Rand
muttered an oath, then, with a characteristic cool resolve, rode up to M. Achille Pincornet
and wished him good-day.

"Good-day, Mr. Rand," echoed the dancing master, and stared at the bank. "Parbleu, sir! Why
did you come that way?"

"I left my servant a little way down the road and struck into the woods after a doe I started.
I'll gallop back and meet him now. Are you for Charlottesville, Mr. Pincornet?"

"Not to-day, sir. I have a dancing class at Red Fields." Mr. Pincornet still stared. "I would
say, sir, that the chase had been long and hard."

Rand laughed. "Am I so torn and breathless? No, no; it was short but rough--a few minutes and
perhaps half a mile! Well, I will rejoin my negro and we'll make for town before the storm breaks."

"Wait here and your negro will come to you."

"Mahomet to the mountain? No; he is a sleepy-head, and I shall find him loitering. Good-day,
good-day!"

With a wave of his hand he left the dancing master still staring and turned Selim's head to
the east. He rode quickly, but no longer headlong, and he scanned with deliberation the long
stretch of the main road. When at last he saw that which he sought, he backed his horse into
the shadow of a great wayside walnut, drew rein, and awaited Young Isham's approach.

The boy and the mare came steadily on, moving at quickened speed under the lowering skies.
Young Isham did not see his master until he was almost beneath the walnut tree; when he did
so, he uttered a cry and well-nigh fell from the mare.

"Gawd-a-moughty, marster!"

Rand spoke without moving. "Get down, Young Isham, and come here."

The negro obeyed, though with shaking knees. "Lawd hab mercy, marster, whar you come f'om?
I done lef' you at de ford."

"I'll speak to you of that presently. Whom have you passed on the road since you left the ford?
How many people and what kind of people? Think now."

"I ain' pass skeerce a soul, sah. Eberybody skurryin' in f'om de storm. Jes' some niggahs wid
mules, an' a passel ob chillern, an' a man I don' know. Dey ain' stop ter speak ter me, an
I ain' stop ter speak ter dem."

Rand leaned from his saddle and laid the butt of his riding-whip upon the boy's shoulder. "Look
at me, Young Isham."

"Yaas, marster."

"You did not leave me at the ford. We took the main road together, and we've been travelling
together ever since, except that perhaps ten minutes ago I rode on ahead and waited for you
beneath this tree." He raised the whip handle and brought it down heavily. "Look at me, Young
Isham,--in the eyes."

The boy whimpered. "Yaas, marster."

"We crossed the ford at the mill."

"Yaas, marster."

"And we kept on together by the main road."

"We--Yaas, marster."

"We have travelled together all the way from Richmond, and we have travelled by the main road.
Now say what I have said."

"Marster--"

"Say it!"

"Don', marster, don'! I'll say jes' what you say! We done cross de ford an' tek de main road--"

"Yes."

"An' we done keep de main road, jes' lak dis."

"That's enough. If you forget and say the wrong thing, Young Isham,--"

"Don', marster! Fer de Lawd's sake, don' look at me lak dat! I ain' gwine fergit, sah,--de
Lawd Jesus know I ain'!"

Rand lifted the whip handle from his shoulder. "Mount, then, and come on. There's no good in
idling here."

A few moments later they overtook and passed Mr. Pincornet, now briskly walking, kit under
arm, toward his dancing class. They bowed in passing, and Rand, turning in his saddle, looked
back at the figure in faded finery. "There's danger there," he thought. "Where isn't it now?"
As he faced again toward Charlottesville, his glance fell upon Young Isham, and he saw that
the boy was looking fixedly at his sleeve.

The master made no movement of avoidance. "The mare's going well enough," he said quietly.
"We'll draw rein at Red Fields, and then hurry home. Use your whip and bring her on."

They paused at Red Fields, then went on to the edge of town. The forked lightnings were playing
and the trees beginning to sway. "We'll stop a moment," Rand said over his shoulder, "at Mr.
Mocket's."

Door and window of the small house where Tom and Vinie lived were shut against the storm. Tom
was yet in Richmond, and Vinie was afraid of lightning. In the darkened atmosphere the zinnias
and marigolds up and down the path struck a brave note of red and yellow. The grapevine on
the porch was laden with purple bunches that the rising wind bade fair to break and scatter.
Rand dismounted, with a gesture bidding the boy to await him, entered the broken gate, and,
walking up the path between the marigolds, knocked upon the closed door.

There was a sound within as of some one rising hastily, an exclamation, and Vinie opened the
door. "I knew 'twas you! I just said to myself, 'That ith Mr. Rand's knock,' and it was! Wait,
thir, and I'll make the room light."

She threw open the closed shutters. "I'm jutht afraid of lightning when I'm by myself. How
are you, thir?"

"Very well. Vinie, I want a basin of warm water and soap."

"Yeth, thir. The kettle's on. I'll fix it in Tom's room."

In the bare little chamber Rand washed the blood from his coat-sleeve. It was not easy to do,
but at last the cloth was clean. He came out of the room with the basin in his hands. Vinie,
waiting in the little hall, started forward. "Open the back door," he said, "and let me throw
this out." Vinie tried to take the basin. "I'll empty it, thir." Her eyes fell upon the water.
"You've hurt yourself!"

"No," answered Rand. "I have not. It is nothing--a bit of a cut that I gave myself."

He pushed the door open and poured out the stained water upon the ground, then took fresh from
a bucket standing by and rinsed the basin before he set it down upon the table. "Vinie--"

"Yeth, thir."

"I want a promise from you."

"Yeth, Mr. Rand."

"You've always been my good friend, ever since long ago when you came from the little house
in Richmond to this little house in Charlottesville, and I was reading law with Mr. Henning.
Why, I don't know what I should do without you and Tom!"

Vinie's eyes filled. "I couldn't--Tom and me couldn't--do without you, Mr. Rand. You're our
best friend, and we'd die for you, and you know it. I'll promise you anything, and I'll keep
my promise."

"I know that you will. It's nothing more than this. Vinie, I don't want it known that I stopped
here to-day, and I want you to forget--look at me, Vinie."

"Yeth, thir."

"I want you to forget what I asked you for, and what I did in Tom's room.

"Yeth, thir," said Vinie, with large eyes. "And that you cut yourself?"

"That, too. Everything, Vinie, except that, coming along the main road, I stopped a moment
at the gate to say how d'ye do, and to tell you that Tom would be at home in two or three days.
That is all, and my coming into the house and the rest of it never was. Do you understand?"

"I won't say anything at all, thir."

"It's a promise?"

"Yeth, thir. I promise."

They went out into the porch together. "Ithn't there anything else?"

Rand, studying in silence the clouds and the whirling dust, had started down the step or two
to the path between the marigolds. He paused. "I can't think of anything, Vinie"; then, after
a moment, and very oddly, "Would you give me, once more, a cup of cool water?"

Vinie brought it in her hand. "You always thaid this water washed the dust off clean."

Rand drank, and gave back the cup. "Thank you. I'll go on now. How your vine has borne this year!"

"Yeth. I'm going to make some wine this week. Good-bye."

Her visitor passed through the little yard, between the vivid flowers. At the gate he turned
his head. "Tom is really coming, Vinie, in two or three days."

"Yeth, thir," said Vinie. "I'll be mighty glad to see him."

Rand mounted, and he and Young Isham rode away. Vinie stood upon the porch and watched them
as far as the turn in the road. A gust of hot wind blew against her, ruffling her calico dress
and lifting light tendrils of hair from her forehead and neck. In the southwest the lightning
flashed fiercely and there came a crash of thunder. Vinie uttered a startled cry, clapped her
hands to her ears, and ran into the house.

Rand rode through a portion of the main street of Charlottesville. He kept the pace of a man
who wishes to be at home before the rain falls, but his manner of going showed no undue haste
and no trepidation. Faces at doors and windows, men gathered before the Eagle and the post-office,
greeted him. He answered each salute in kind, and at the Eagle drew rein long enough to reply
to the inevitable questions as to Richmond and the trial, and to agree that the rain was needed,
since the main road, from Bates's Mill on, was nothing but a trough of dust.

"That's so," chimed in one. "If it wasn't so rough, the river road would be pleasanter travelling.
There's the first drop!"

Rand looked up at the clouds. "I'll gallop on, gentlemen. A rain is coming that will lay the dust."

Once upon the road to Roselands, neither horse nor mare was spared. Rand travelled at speed
beneath an inky sky. At the turn to Greenwood he looked once toward the distant house, half
hidden by mighty oaks. It was no more than once. He had a vision of a riderless horse, tearing
away from a stream, through the woods, and he thought, "How soon?" He drew a difficult breath,
and he put for a moment his hand before his eyes, then spurred Selim on, and in a little while
came within sight of his own gates.

CHAPTER XXXI

HUSBAND AND WIFE

As he rode up the drive, he saw Jacqueline waiting for him, a gleam of white upon the grey
doorstone, beyond the wind-tossed beech. He dismounted, sent Young Isham around with the horses,
and walked across the burned grass. She met him with outstretched arms, beneath the beech tree.
"Lewis, Lewis!"

He held her to him, bent back her face, kissed her brow and eyes and mouth. There was a wild
energy in clasp and touch. "You love me still?" he cried. "That's true--that's true, Jacqueline?"

"You know--you know it's true! I was born only to love you--and I thought that you would never
come!"

The thunder crashed above them, and the advance of the rain was heard upon the beech leaves.
"Come indoors--come out of the storm!" She drew his hand that she held to her and laid it on
her bosom. "Oh, welcome home, my dear!"

They went together into the house and into their own chamber. The windows were dark with the
now furious rain, but a light fire burned upon the hearth. Rand stood looking down upon it.
His wife watched him, her arms resting upon the back of a great flowered chair. Suddenly she
spoke. "Lewis, what is the matter?"

He half turned toward her. "I believed that you would see. And yet you were blind to that earlier
course of mine."

"Something dreadful is the matter. Tell me at once."

After a moment he repeated sombrely, "'At once.' How can I tell you at once? There are things
that are slowly brought about by all time, and to show them as they truly are would require
all time again. How can I tell you at all? My God!"

"I feel," she answered, "years older than I did two weeks ago. If there was something then
to forgive, I have forgiven it. Our souls did not come together to share only the lit paths,
the honey in the cup. Tell me, Lewis."

"It is black and bitter--there is no light, and it will kill the sweetness. If I could live
with you and you never know it, I would try to do so--try to keep it secret from you as I did
that lesser thing. I cannot--even now, without a word, you know in part."

"Tell me all--that lesser thing."

Rand turned from the fire and, coming to the great chair against whose back she leaned, knelt
in its flowered lap and bowed his forehead upon her hands. "I am glad," he said, in a voice
so low that she bent to hear it,--"I am glad now that I have no son."

There was a silence while the rain dashed against the window-panes and the thunder rolled overhead;
then Jacqueline pressed her cheek against his bowed head. "What have you done?" she whispered.
"Tell me--oh, tell me!"

After a moment he told her. "I have killed a man."

"Killed--It was by accident!"

"No. It was not accident. I came upon him by accident--I'll claim no more than that. The black
rage was there to blind me, make me deaf--mole and adder! But it was not accident, what I did.
I'll not cheat you here, and I'll not cheat myself. The name of it is murder."

He felt her hands quiver beneath his forehead, and he put up his own and clasped her wrist.
"Are you thinking, 'I should have left him in the tobacco-fields'? As for me, I know that I
ought never to have spoken to you there beneath the apple tree."

"Lewis, who was the man?"

He made no answer, and after a moment or two, numbed and grey, had passed, she needed none.
The truth fell like a stroke from glowing iron. With a cry she dragged her hands from Rand's,
left the chair, and, crossing the room, flung herself down beside the chintz-covered couch
and cowered there with a hidden face. Rand arose and, walking to the window, stared at the
veil of rain and the stabbing lightning. The clock ticked, a log upon the hearth parted with
a soft sound, from the back of the house came faintly the homely cheer of the servants' voices.
How deadly, how solemnly still, how wet and cold, was now a rocky strand upon the river road!
He left the window and, coming to the couch, looked down upon the crouching figure of his wife.
His brain was not numbed; it was pitilessly awake, and he suffered. The name of his star was
Wormwood.

At last she stirred, lifted her head from her arm, and arose, moving stiffly and slowly as
though she had grown old. Her face was drawn and colorless. She moved, mechanically, to the
fire, laid fresh wood upon it, and, taking a small broom from the corner, made the hearth clean;
then, returning, sat down upon the couch that was printed with bright roses and held out her
hands. "Come," she said, in her low, musical voice. "Come, tell me--"

He sank upon his knees beside her and bowed his head upon her lap. "Jacqueline, Jacqueline!
I rode away from Richmond, in black anger--"

He told her all, now speaking with a forced and hard deliberation, now with a broken and strangled
voice, short words and short sentences--at the last, monosyllables.

When the tale was done, they stayed for a little, motionless. There was yet bright lightning
with long peals of thunder, and the rain beat with passion against the panes. Jacqueline moistened
her ups, tried to speak, at last found a broken and uncertain voice. "You left him--lying there?"

"The horse broke away--ran on through the wood. It will have been caught ere now, or it will
make its way to Greenwood. Is Fairfax Cary at home?"

"He came last night. He was at Fontenoy this morning."

Rand stood up. "It is done, and all the rueing in the world will not make the breath alight
again." With a gesture, singular and decided, he walked to the window and again looked out
at the rain and lightning. "If I know--if I know Fairfax Cary--Has the horse been captured--and
where? It may be known now, and it may not be known for hours." He stood, reviewing chances,
and the shaken soul began to settle to its ancient base. At last he turned. "There's danger
enough, but the struggle must be made. If you love me still, I'll find the heart to make it;
ay, and to succeed!" Coming back to her, he took her in his arms. "You do love me? That isn't
dead?"

"I love you, Lewis."

"Then, by God, I'll fight it out! Jacqueline, Jacqueline--"

She presently freed herself. "What are you going to do--what are you going to do now, Lewis?"

"I will tell you what I have done, and where the danger's greatest--"

"The danger?"

"The danger of discovery."

"Lewis--will you not tell them?"

"Tell them--"

"Is it not--oh, Lewis, is it not the only thing to do? Sin and suffering--yes, yes, the whole
world sins and suffers! But oh, ignoble to sin and to reject the suffering!"

He stared at her incredulously. "Do you know, Jacqueline,--do you know what you are saying?"

"Will it be so hard?" she asked, and put out her arms to him. "It is right."

"Let me understand," he said. "When the mist cleared and I saw him lying there, I sat down
upon a stone, and I said to myself, 'This is a strange land, and I am to eat the fruits thereof.'
For a while I did not think of moving. You would have had me stay there as he stayed, watch
there beside him until men came?"

She answered almost inaudibly, "It had been nobler."

"And then and there to have given myself up?"

"Lewis, if it was right--I would have said to God and the world and him, 'It is the least that
I can do!'"

He stared at her. "By God, the amende honorable!"

There came blinding lightning, followed by thunder which seemed to shake the room. Rand crossed
to the hearth and, with his booted foot upon the iron dogs, rested his arm upon the mantel-shelf
and his head upon his hand. "I'll think of that awhile," he said harshly. "That means disgrace
and may mean death."

He heard the drawing of her breath. There was a knock at the door followed by Mammy Chloe's
voice. "De bread an' meat an' wine on de table, marster."

"Very well, Mammy, I'll come presently," the master answered; then, when she was gone, "This
is the earth, Jacqueline. It was long while I sat there upon the stone and saw matters as they
might be upon another plane, but that appearance passed. Because for those moments I saw its
shape, I know the aspect that is before your eyes. But it is not reality that you see; it is
an appearance, thin and unsubstantial as the mist upon the hills. Expiation, purgation, aided
retribution, the criminal to spare Justice the search, and the offender against Society to
turn and throw his weight into the proper scale!--that is a dream of the world as it may become.
This is the present earth,--earth of the tobacco-fields, earth of the struggle, earth of the
fight for standing-room! I have fought--and I have fought--I cannot cease to fight."

With his foot he pushed back the burning wood. "I did not kill him in self-defence. I killed
him in anger. That is murder. Say, for argument, that it is confessed murder. I will tell you,
as a lawyer, what that means. It means a full stop. Life stopped, work stopped, fame stopped--a
period black as ink, and never to be erased! A stop deep as the grave and sharp as the hangman's
drop, and the record that it closes empty, vile, read at the best with horror and pity, read
at the worst with a glance aside at every man and woman whom the stained hand had ever touched!
That is what would come if I followed this appearance." He struck the hand at which he looked
against the mantel-shelf. "And if he says, 'Ay, Lewis Rand, it is so that I would do,' I will
answer, 'Yes! being you!--but what, Ludwell Cary, had you lain in my cradle?" His face worked
and he turned from the mantel to the great chair. "Oh, mother!" he said beneath his breath.

Jacqueline came and knelt beside him. "Lewis, Lewis, is it all so dark?"

He touched her hair with his fingers. "Dark! I feel as though I were in a bare, light place.
Underground, you know, but bare and flooded with light. Well, Jacqueline, well--"

She clung to him without speech, and he went on. "There is enough to create suspicion. We were
travelling at the same hour, and it is known that we were opponents. The crossroads where I
slept last night--there was nothing, I think, said at the inn. Then the forge, and the mill.
At the mill they will swear to telling me that he took the main road, and since they could
not see the ford, they must suppose that I, too, went that way. The main road. There's the
insistence. I kept to the main road. As for Young Isham, I can manage him. That old Frenchman
is more difficult. Danger there--unless he holds his tongue. There's a witness indeed lying
at the bottom of some pool below the strand, but the strand may sink into the sea before that
witness is found! There is this and there is that, but they'll serve no warrant on the this
and that the world can see. I have won more difficult cases." 

We may imagine the wrath with which the lord of so many nations must
have heard, nine years before the battle of Marathon, that a strange
nation towards the setting sun, called the Athenians, had dared to
help his rebels in Ionia against him, and that they had plundered
and burnt the capital of one of his provinces.

Before the burning of Sardis, Darius seems never to have heard of the existence of Athens; but
his satraps in Asia Minor had for some time seen Athenian refugees at their provincial courts
imploring assistance against their fellow-countrymen. When Hippias was driven away from Athens,
and the tyrannic dynasty of the Pisistratidae finally overthrown in 510 B.C., the banished tyrant
and his adherents, after vainly seeking to be restored by Spartan
intervention, had betaken themselves to Sardis, the capital city of
the satrapy of Artaphernes.

There Hippias (in the expressive words of Herodotus) [Herod. lib. v. c. 96.] began every kind
of agitation, slandering the Athenians before Artaphernes, and doing
all he could to induce the satrap to place Athens in subjection to
him, as the tributary vassal of King Darius.

When the Athenians heard of his practices, they sent envoys to Sardis to remonstrate with the
Persians against taking up the quarrel of the Athenian refugees.

But Artaphernes gave them in reply a menacing command to receive Hippias back again if they
looked for safety. The Athenians were resolved not to purchase safety at such a price; and after
rejecting the satrap's terms, they considered that they and the Persians were declared enemies.
At this very crisis the Ionian Greeks implored the assistance of their European brethren,
to enable them to recover their independence from Persia. Athens, and the city of Eretria
in Euboea, alone consented. Twenty Athenian galleys, and five Eretrian, crossed the AEgean Sea;
and by a bold and sudden march upon Sardis the Athenians and their allies succeeded in capturing
the capital city of the haughty satrap, who had recently menaced them with servitude or destruction.
The Persian forces were soon rallied, and the Greeks were compelled
to retire.

They were pursued, and defeated on their return to the coast, and Athens took no further part
in the Ionian war.

       But the insult that she had put upon the Persian power was speedily
made known throughout that empire, and was never to be forgiven or
forgotten.

In the emphatic simplicity of the narrative of Herodotus, the wrath of the Great King is thus
described:--"Now when it was told to King Darius that Sardis had been taken and burnt by the
Athenians and Ionians, he took small heed of the Ionians, well knowing who they were, and that
their revolt would soon be put down: but he asked who, and what manner of men, the Athenians
were.

And when he had been told, he called for his bow; and, having taken
it, and placed an arrow on the string, he let the arrow fly towards
heaven; and as he shot it into the air, he said, 'O Supreme God! grant
me that I may avenge myself on the Athenians.' And when he had said
this, he appointed one of his servants to say to him every day as
he sat at meat, 'Sire, remember the Athenians.'"

Some years were occupied in the complete reduction of Ionia.
 You thought him that, but he never was, he never was!"

"I want to tell you," he said, "that all rage is dead. I feel as though I had left anger far
behind, and why there was in my mind so great venom and rancour I no longer know. Envy and
jealousy, too, are gone. They have been struck out of life, and other things have come to take
their place."

"Ay," she cried, "what other things! O God, O God!"

There was a long silence, while the wind sighed in the beech tree and the fire muttered on
the hearth. Jacqueline sat in the flowered chair, her raised arms resting upon its back, her
head buried in her arms. Rand, leaning against the mantel, gazed with sombre eyes at her strained
and motionless form. As he stood there, his mind began to move through the galleries where
she was painted. He saw her, a child, beneath the apple tree, and in her blue gown that day
in the Fontenoy garden, and then again beneath the apple tree, a child no longer, but the woman
whom he loved. He saw her face above him the afternoon they laid him in the blue room, and
he saw her singing to her harp in the Fontenoy drawing-room,--

"The thirst that from the soul doth rise--"

He saw the next morning--the summer-house, the box, the mockingbird in the poplar tree, the
Seven Sisters rose--and then their marriage eve, and that fair first summer on the Three-Notched
Road, and all the three years of their wedded life. The picture of her was everywhere, and
not least in the house on Shockoe Hill. He saw her as she had been one snowy evening in February,
and he saw her as she had looked the hour of his return from Williamsburgh--the pleading, the
passion, and the beauty. And now--now--

The wind sighed again without the windows, and Jacqueline drew a shuddering breath. He spoke.
"Jacqueline!"

She moved slightly. "Yes, Lewis."

"The night is quiet, after the storm. He lies at rest beside the stream. This morning he will
be found, lifted tenderly, lamented, mourned. It is not a gruesome place. I remember trees
and fluttering birds. He sleeps--he sleeps--like Duncan he sleeps well at last. Is he to be
so pitied?"

She moaned, "Yes--but you also, you also! Oh, break, break!"

"Listen, Jacqueline. It lacks but an hour of dawn. When it is day, you may give me up. Rouse
Joab and send for the sheriff and your uncles and for Fairfax Cary. I will dress and await
them in the library. Indeed, you may do it now--there's no need to wait for dawn."

She rose from her chair and went the length of the room, resting at last, with raised arms
and covered face, against the farthest window. He spoke on. "If all thought alike, Jacqueline,
if all saw action and consequence with one vision--but we do not so, no, not on this earth!
You and I are sundered there. Perhaps it is to my shame that it is so,--I cannot tell. What
you asked for this afternoon, that confession, that decision, that accord with justice and
acceptance of penalty, I cannot give freely and of conviction, Jacqueline. Why did you think
I had that exaltation of mind? I have it not; no, nor one man in five hundred thousand! The
man I--murdered--perhaps possessed it; indeed, I think that he did. But I--I do not own it,
nor can I see matters with another's vision. I see a struggle to prevent disgrace and disaster,
to retrieve and hold an endangered standing-room--a struggle determined and legitimate. I am
capable of making it. But though I'll avow that another man's vision transcends mine, I'll
dispute with him the power of loving! I love you with a passion as deep, strong, and abiding
as if I, too, walked in that rarer air. I am of the earth and rooted in the earth, but I love
you utterly. If you want this thing, I will give it to you. It was unmanly of me to say but
now, 'You may do this, you may do that, and I will not lift a finger to prevent you.' I will
not leave it to you, Jacqueline. I will awaken Joab and send him with a note to your uncles."

He moved toward the door, but before he could reach it his wife was before him, her weight
thrown against him, her raised hands thrusting him back to the hearth. She shook her head,
and her long hair shadowed her; she strove for utterance, but could find only a strangled "No--no";
then, still clinging to him, she slipped to her knees and so to her face, and lay there in
a swoon in the red zone of the firelight.

CHAPTER XXXII

THE BROTHERS

At Fontenoy the deluging rain and pitchy blackness of the night sufficiently warranted Colonel
Dick's assertion that it was an evening for a sensible man to stay where he was, and that a
bowl of punch and wedding-talk and Unity at the harpsichord were to be preferred to a progress
to Greenwood through such a downpour and a foot of mud. Ludwell!--Ludwell wouldn't be there
anyway. He was a man of sense and would be sleeping at Red Fields, if indeed he had ever left
Malplaquet. Fairfax Cary was persuaded, and after a very happy evening in the drawing-room,
went to bed and to sleep in the blue room.

Dressing, next morning, he gazed around him. The room was familiar to him, and he had a liking
for it, from the mandarin on the screen to General Washington on the wall. The storm had passed
away early in the night, and it was now a lovely morning, clear-washed, fresh, and fragrant.
He looked out of the window toward the blue hills, and down into the garden where autumn flowers
were in bloom, and as he dressed he hummed an air that Unity had sung.

     "Give me pleasure, give me pain,
     Give me wine of life again!
     Death is night without a morn,
     Give the rose and give the thorn."

Downstairs he found Miss Dandridge and Major Edward upon the wide porch. The wind had torn
away a great bough from one of the poplars, and Colonel Dick and Deb upon the drive below were
superintending its removal. Birds were singing, delicate airs astir. "It's going to be the
divinest day!" said Unity, and led the way to the dining-room.

Breakfast went happily on with talk of politics, county affairs, and now and then from Colonel
Dick a sly allusion to the approaching marriage. The meal was nearly over when old Cato, coming
in from the hail, said something in a low voice to his master. Colonel Churchill pushed back
his chair. "Excuse me a moment, Unity, my dear. There's a man wants to see me."

He left the room. Fairfax Cary and Major Edward continued a discussion of the latest Napoleonic
victory; Unity played with her spoon and thought of her wedding-gown; Deb drank her glass of
milk and planned a visit with Miranda to a blasted pine tree, lived in, all the quarter agreed,
by a ha'nt that came out at night, like a ring of smoke out of a great black pipe!

Colonel Dick's figure appeared for an instant in the doorway. "Edward, come here a moment,
will you?"

"A thousand hussars, and the thing went off like flaming tinder," finished Major Edward. He
laid down his napkin and arose. "Excuse me, Unity. Very well, Dick," and left the room.

"Unity," enquired Deb. "Are there any ha'nts?"

"No, honey, no!"

"Just make believe?"

"Just make believe."

"Oh!" exclaimed Deb, and fell to wondering if the ha'nt would come out if only she and Miranda
sat long enough before the tree. It might get hungry.

"Will you have another cup?" asked Unity of the guest, her hand upon the coffee-urn. "No? Then
let us go and see what is the matter. They are not coming back."

"I want," whispered Fairfax Cary, as they left the table, "to talk to you about--about two
weeks from now. Don't you think it would be sweet and shady this morning, under the catalpa tree?"

He managed to touch her hand, and she turned her velvety eyes upon him with both laughter and
moisture in their black depths. "I've chosen the place for Unity Dandridge's grave. Would you
like to see it? It's underneath the flowering almond."

Fairfax Cary glanced behind him. The servants were out of the room; Deb was gathering crumbs
for the birds. "Give me one kiss! If you knew how much I love you! The world's tuned to-day
just to that."

"Such an old tune! The world has other things to think of and other airs than that!"

They went out into the hail. It was empty, but through the open doors voices sounded from the
porch at the back of the house. Another moment and Major Edward appeared, stood still at the
sight of Cary, then came on up the hall to meet the two. He looked intensely grey and meagre,
and his thin lips twitched. "Fairfax," he said,--"Fairfax, look here--"

The other, who had been laughing, grew suddenly grave. "I have never heard you, sir, use a
voice like that. Has anything happened?"

Major Edward made a little noise in his throat, then stiffened himself as if on parade. "There
may have been an accident. It looks that way, Fair. It was Eli who came."

"Eli! What has happened at Greenwood? Ludwell's home?

"Unity, my dear," said the Major, "let him come with me. Let's go into the library, Fair."

But Fairfax Cary was halfway down the hail. The Major hastened after him, and at the porch
door laid a thin old hand upon the other's arm. "Fair, my boy, you are going to need all a
man's courage. Think of Dick and me as of Fauquier Cary's--as of your father's--old, old friend
Come, now."

They found on the square porch at the back of the house, Colonel Churchill, the negro Eli,
and a white man, roughly dressed. The first, seated on the steps, his elbows on his knees and
his face in his hands, looked up with a gasp. "Fair, Fair--"

Cary spoke with steadiness "What has brought you here, Eli? Mr. Ludwell came home last night?"

Eli, trembling violently, and of the ashen hue that a negro takes in terror, tried to answer,
but at first there came only jabbered and meaningless words. He fell on his knees, and finally
became coherent. "Marse Fair--Marse Fair--ain' I done lif' you bofe in dese ahms w'en you wuz
jes' little fellers--he er lot de oldes' an' you nuttin' but er baby, toddlin' after him eberywhar
he went! Ain' I done ride behin' you bofe dese yeahs an' yeahs? Oh, Gawd-a-moughty! O Lawd,
hab mercy--"

Cary took him by the shoulder. "Eli, stop that crying out and tell me at once what is the matter!
What has happened to Mr. Ludwell?"

"I'll tell you, Fair," answered the Major, in a shaking voice. "The negro can't do it. Ludwell
did not come home last night, and this morning James Wilson, here, found Saladin--"

"Far up the river road, near my house," said the man upon the steps. "'Twas just about daybreak.
I didn't know, sir, whose horse he was, so I put him in my stable. Then my son and me and Joe
White, a neighbour of mine, we set out down the river road."

"Oh, my young marster! Oh, my young marster!" wailed Eli. "De kindes' an' de bes'! Oh, Lawd
hab mercy!"

"It was just dawn, sir, and we went down the road--we were on horseback--quite a good bit of
miles. There wasn't any sign until we came to where Indian Run crosses the road; but on the
further side, where there's a strip of rocks, you know, sir--"

The speaker stopped short. "They found him there, Fair," finished Major Edward.

The young man turned squarely to the old. "Thank you, sir. You are the man for me. Was he--is
he badly hurt?"

"There's nothing can ever hurt him more, my dear. It is you, and we with you, who must suffer
now. They found him--they found him dead, Fair."

There was a silence; then, "Ludwell--Ludwell dead?" said Cary. "I don't believe you, Major
Churchill."

He turned, walked to a bench that ran along the wall, and sat down. "Eli, get up from there
and stop that camp-meeting wailing! Mr. Wilson, you perhaps do not yet know my brother's horse--black
with a white star. Colonel Dick, they've got hold of the wrong end of some damned rigmarole
or other--"

"I didn't know the horse, sir," replied Wilson, not without gentleness, "for I've been out
of the county for a long time, and your brother used to ride a bay. But I knew your brother, sir."

"That's what I said, too, Fair," groaned Colonel Churchill from the steps. "I said it was all
a damned mistake. But I was wrong. You listen to Edward. Edward, tell him all!"

"Yes, Dick. It is true, Fair, damnably, devilishly true. He had been dead for hours, Fair."

"Joe White's something of a doctor, sir," put in Wilson. "Joe said he would have been lying
there since before the storm."

Fairfax Cary drew a gasping breath "Lying there, suffering, through the storm and darkness?
Thrown? Ill and fallen from his horse? Major Edward, don't play with me!" He started up. "Where
is he now?"

"We left him there, sir, just as he was, with Joe White to guard him. My son, he undertook
to rouse the nearest people. I happened to know, sir, that the sheriff was staying overnight
near Red Fields, and I sent him there first. I told the coroner myself, and then I came as
hard as I could ride to Greenwood, where I heard that you were here--"

"It was thought best not to move him at once, Fair. They are intelligent men, and they were
right." The Major's hand closed around the other's wrist. "He did not suffer, Fair. He was
not thrown. He was shot--shot through the heart!"

"And there, by God," came from the steps Colonel Dick's deep voice, "there, at least, there's
something to be done! But oh, my poor boy, my poor boy!"

Unity came from the doorway, took her lover's hands, and pressed them to her lips. "Fair,"
she whispered, "Fair!"

He kissed her on the forehead. "There, dear! We won't sit under the catalpa tree this morning.
Eli! get the horses."

"They have been ordered, Fair," said the Colonel. "We'll go together, you and Edward and I."

The little rocky strand above the stream upon the river road lay half in sun and half in shade.
After the storm the air was crystal. Birds sang in the forest trees, and the stream laughed
as it slid over ledges into deep pools. The sky was blue, the day brilliant, a cool wind rustled
through the laurels, and the wet earth sent out odours of mould and trodden leaf. Perhaps a
score of men and boys, engaged in excited talk and in as close a scrutiny of one quiet figure
as a line which the sheriff had drawn would permit, turned at the sound of rapid hoofs and
watched the Churchills and Fairfax Cary, with Wilson and Eli, come down to the stream.

"Back, all of you, men!" ordered the sheriff, in a low voice. "That is Mr. Fairfax Cary"; then
turned to a spectator or two of importance: "Mr. Morris, Mr. Page--I hope you'll be so good
as to meet them with me? This is a dreadful thing!"

The Fontenoy party splashed through Indian Run and dismounted. It was not an ungentle people,
and the little strand, from the woods to the water, was now free from intruding figures. Only
the sheriff, the coroner, and the two planters, old friends and neighbours, remained, and these
joined the Churchills. Fairfax Cary walked alone to his brother's side and stood, looking down.

Ludwell Cary lay peacefully. One arm was outstretched, the head a little back, the face quiet,
with nothing in it of wrath or fear or pain. The storm had not hurt him. There was little disarray.
It was much as though he had thrown himself down there, beside the water, with a sigh for the
pleasure of rest. The younger Cary waited motionless for the blood to come back to his heart
and the mist before his eyes to clear. It cleared; he saw plainly his brother, guide, and friend,
and with a cry he flung himself down and across the body.

The men at the water's edge turned away their faces. The rudest unit of the small throng beneath
the trees put up a sudden hand and removed his cap, and his example was followed. It had been
a known thing, the comradeship of these brothers, and there were few in the county more loved
than the Carys.

Moments passed. The sheriff spoke in a low voice to Mr. Morris, whereupon the latter whispered
to Colonel Churchill. "Edward," said the Colonel, "time's being lost. Hadn't you better try
to get him away?"

Major Edward moved along the bank to the two forms and stood in silence, gazing with twitching
lips at the dead man's countenance, so impassive, cold, remote, alien now from all interests
of this flesh, quite indifferent to love or to hate, supremely careless as to whether his story
were ever told. The Major put his hand to his fierce old eagle eyes, and took it away wet with
tears, slow, acrid, and difficult. He stooped and touched the living man. "Fair,--come, Fair!"

The other moved slightly, but did not offer to rise. Major Edward waited, then touched him
again. "Fair, we want to mark closely how he lies, and then we want to take him to Greenwood.
He has been here long, you know."

His words elicited only a low groan, but presently Cary lifted himself from the body, remained
for a moment upon his knees, then rose to his feet. "Yes, to Greenwood," he said. "He lay here
last night in the wind and rain, and I was warm and happy--I was asleep and dreaming! Why did
I leave him at Elm Tree? If I had been with him--"

His face changed, startlingly. He stooped with rapidity, looked at and touched the dark stain
upon the coat, straightened himself, and turned violently upon the Major and the little group
which had now approached. "Who?" he demanded in a voice that rose to a hoarse cry. "Who?"

Colonel Churchill answered him. "We don't know, Fair, but by the living God, we'll find out!"
and the sheriff, "We've no clue yet, sir, but if 'twas plain murder--and it looks that way,
for your brother wasn't armed--then I reckon the man who did it will as soon find his ease
in hell as in old Virginia!"

The farmer who had been first upon the ground spoke from the edge of the group. "I never heard
a soul in this county say a hard word of Mr. Cary. I shouldn't ha' thought, barring politics,
that he had an enemy."

"Ha!" said Major Edward, but not loudly.

The sheriff spoke again. "Mr. Fairfax Cary, we've got a kind of litter here, made of branches,
and we'd best be going on. The sooner the law has its hand on this, the better. Shall we lift
him now, sir?"

All were by this time gathered about the form on the earth, and the throng at the edge of the
wood had also come nearer. Trust me well, that in the design in which thou dost embark, thou
hast for thy partners the mighty and the valiant, the power of the church, and the pride of the
noble. Succeed or fail, live or die, thy name shall be among those with whom success or failure
is alike glorious, death or life alike desirable. Forward, then, forward! life is short, and
our plan is laborious--Angels, saints, and the whole blessed host
of heaven, have their eyes even now on this barren and blighted land
of Scotland--What say I? on Scotland? their eye is on us, Roland--on
the frail woman, on the inexperienced youth, who, amidst the ruins
which sacrilege hath made in the holy place, devote themselves to
God's cause, and that of their lawful Sovereign.

Amen, so be it!
 He had been, even
this morning, a young man, handsome and gallant, with a bright eye, a most happy manner, a
charm and spirit wholly admirable. All Albemarle knew and liked him under that aspect. The
men about him had seen grief and horror and rage, each exhibited strongly out of a strong nature.
They now saw, from out of youth and the war of emotions, the man emerge. He came slowly but
steadfastly, a man with a set purpose, which he was like to pursue through life. The growth
of years took place almost at once, though not the growth that would have been but for this
releasing stroke. Latencies in the backward and abysm of inheritance that would not have stirred
under a less tremendous stimulus stirred under this, grew, and pushed aside the gay and even
life that might have been. The growth was rapid and visible, as visible the sharp turn from
every former shining goal to one which, an hour before, the runner had not seen. The men who
watched him somewhat held their breath.

The change that was wrought was profound. The man who was stretched upon the earth looked now
the younger of the two. He seemed also to have given something of the calmness of his state,
for Fairfax Cary no longer grieved with voice or gesture or convulsion of feature. He was quiet,
pale, and resolute, and he now spoke to the sheriff evenly enough. "Yes, Mr. Garrett, we'll
take him home. Where is the litter?"

Four men brought it forward. Ludwell Cary was lifted by his brother and Colonel Churchill and
laid reverently upon the stretcher of branches where the green leaves nodded above his quiet
face. The little procession formed and, with the younger Cary walking beside the litter, crossed
the shallow ford and moved slowly up the winding river road.

CHAPTER XXXIII

GREENWOOD

The murder, by an unknown hand, of Ludwell Cary, shot through the heart, beside Indian Run,
as he rode from Malplaquet to Greenwood, became the overwhelming topic of interest in Albemarle,
and a chief subject far and wide throughout the great state. His kinsmen and connections were
numerous, and he had himself been a man widely known, by many greatly liked, and by a few well
loved. There arose from town and country a cry of grief and wrath, a great wave of sympathy
for the one man left of all the Greenwood Carys, solitary now in the old brick house behind
the line of oaks, and a loud demand for the speedy discovery and apprehension of the murderer.
Indignation was high, the Court House and the Court House yard crowded on the morning of the
inquest, the verdict brought in by the coroner's jury received by the county at large with
incredulous disappointment. Death at the hands of a person unknown.

No evidence was produced in the court room which threw any clear light upon the commission
of the deed, its motive, or its perpetrator. There were ample accounts of the capture of the
horse, the finding of the body, its position, and the nature of the wound,--medical opinion
in addition that death had been instantaneous, and probably received before the breaking of
the storm. If there had been any telltale track or mark in the soil of the river road, the
continued and beating rain had made the way impossible to read. Witnesses from Malplaquet told
of Ludwell Cary's setting forth that morning, and Forrest, the blacksmith, vouched for his
passing the forge, alone. Men from the mill at the ford swore to his pausing to answer their
questions as to the trial of Aaron Burr, and to his riding on--by the main road. Here arose
the confusion. They were certain that Mr. Cary had taken the main road. They thought so then,
and they did not see yet how they were mistaken. They told the next man who came riding by
that he had taken that road--the main road. It was not the next man,--boatmen and others had
passed going up country,--but when Mr. Rand came up, they told him that Mr. Cary was on the
road before him--the main road. Yes, sir, it was Mr. Rand and his negro boy, and he could speak
for it that Mr. Cary was supposed to be riding to Greenwood by the usual road--the main road.
The river road was after all very little shorter, and everybody knew that it was mortal bad.

Lewis Rand was called. He testified that he had left Richmond upon the third, having with him
a negro boy known as Young Isham. The night of the sixth he had slept at the Cross Roads Tavern
and gone on the next morning, passing Malplaquet about nine. His horse loosening a shoe, he
stopped at Forrest's forge, and there learned from the smith that there was considerable travel,
and that Mr. Cary of Greenwood had passed some time before. "You remember, Forrest? I asked
you if Mr. Cary had mentioned which road he would take at the ford, and you answered that he
had not, but that you supposed the main road the other had been very bad all summer. Again,
at the mill below the ford where I paused to ask for water, the miller, remarking on the travel
home from Richmond, informed me that Mr. Cary had passed not long before. I asked him which
road Mr. Cary had taken, the main road or the river road. He answered--or the men behind him
answered, I cannot now remember which--'The main road.'"

"Ay, that's what we said, and what we thought," interjected the miller.

"It was thus my impression, gained first at the forge," continued the witness, "that Mr. Cary
was before me upon the main road. Until then, knowing him to have left Richmond several days
before me, I had supposed him at Greenwood. I was not averse to a word with him on certain
matters, and I rode rapidly, hoping to overtake him--"

"Upon the main road, sir?"

"The main road, of course. As I did not do so, I concluded that the approaching storm had caused
him to hasten. It was very threatening, and the few that my boy and I passed were hurrying
to shelter. At Red Fields I paused for a moment"--He looked toward a well-known planter, standing
near. "Certainly, Mr. Rand," said the latter promptly. "We tried to make you stay out the storm,
but you would be getting home."

"From Red Fields my boy and I rode on into town. I stopped at my partner's house to tell his
sister when to expect him home from Richmond, and at the Eagle I drew rein for a moment and
exchanged greetings with two or three gentlemen upon the porch. The rain was close at hand,
and my boy and I pushed on to Roselands--where, next morning, a neighbour brought the news
of this murder. I corroborate, sir, as I have been called to do, the statements of Mr. Forrest
and Mr. Bates that it was the impression of all who greeted him as he passed that Mr. Cary
was riding home by the usual road--the main road. I have nothing further to offer, sir."

"Thank you, Mr. Rand," said the coroner, and the witness left the stand.

He was followed by the keeper of a small ordinary upon the main road, halfway between the ford
and Red Fields. "No, sir, Mr. Ludwell Cary didn't travel by the main road. I sat in my door
with my glass and my pipe almost the whole day--until after the storm broke, anyhow. There
wasn't any custom--folk seemed to know it was going to rain like Noah's flood. There was hardly
anybody on the road after about ten. Yes, I might have shut my eyes now and then, though I
don't doze over my pipe and glass half as much as some people say I do. Anyhow, Mr. Ludwell
Cary didn't ride that way--events prove that, don't they, sir? Yes, I remember well enough
when Mr. Rand passed. I wasn't dozing then, for the negro boy spoke to me, said there was going
to be a big storm. It must have been after midday, Mr. Rand?"

"Yes, something after midday."

The witness knew, for he always had his glass at noon. He might have been dozing when the negro
spoke to him, but he spoke plain enough. "'It's going to be an awful storm,' he said, and then
I believe you said something, sir, though I don't remember what it was, and you both rode on.
I wasn't that sleepy that I couldn't see straight. That's all that I know, Mr. Galt."

Two or three other witnesses were called, but they were of the main road, and the main road
had nothing to show further than that it had been travelled upon by Lewis Rand and his negro
boy. They had not seen Mr. Ludwell Cary since he rode to Richmond early in the summer. Yes,
they were sure they had seen Mr. Rand and his negro boy--but the clouds were dark, and the
dust blowing so that you had to hold your head down, and people were thinking of getting indoors.
The boy was riding a mare with a white foot.

"I think we can leave the main road, gentlemen," declared the coroner. "Now the river road
and the stream where this thing was done--"

Indian Run--where did Indian Run come from or lead to, and who might have been upon that lonely
road, or lurking in the laurel and hemlock that clothed the banks of the stream? Three miles
up the water was a camping-ground used by gypsies; at a greater distance down the stream a
straggling settlement of poor whites, long looked at askance by the county. It might be that
some wandering gypsy, some Ishmaelite with a grudge--The enquiry turned again to Fairfax Cary.

"When you went on, Mr. Cary, from Elm Tree, you too supposed that your brother would follow
by the same road? You thought--"

"I did not think at all," answered Cary harshly. "I was lost in my own self and my own concerns.
I was a selfish and heedless wretch, and I hurried away without a thought or care. What he
told me I forgot at the time. But I have remembered it since. He told me that he would take
the river road."

"And on your own way home you repeated that to no one?"

"To no one. I never spoke of him, I do not know that I ever thought of him from Elm Tree to
Greenwood. Oh, my brother!"

A sigh like the wind over corn went through the room. The coroner bent forward. "Mr. Cary,
can you think of any one who bore him ill-will--a runaway negro, perhaps, or some vagrant who
might have been along that stream?"

"No. His slaves loved him. We had no runaways. I do not believe there is a man on Indian Run
who would have touched him."

"Mr. Cary, had he any enemy?"

"He had one. He sits yonder. You have heard his testimony."

The court room murmured again. The old rivalry between Lewis Rand and Ludwell Cary, the antagonism
of years, and the fact of a duel were sufficiently in men's minds--but what of it all? The
duel was a year gone by; political animosities in Virginia might be, and often were, bitter
enough, but they led no further than to such a meeting. The coroner looked disturbed. The murmur
was followed by a curious hush; but if for an instant an idea was poised in the air of the
court room, it did not descend, it was banished as preposterous. The moment's silence was broken
by Lewis Rand. From his place at the side of the room he spoke with a grave simplicity and
straightforwardness, characteristic and impressive, familiar to most there who had heard him
before now, in this court room, on questions of life and death. "Everything is to be pardoned
to Mr. Fairfax Cary's most natural grief. My testimony, sir, is as I gave it."

The coroner's voice broke in upon a deep murmur of assent. "I presume, Mr. Cary, that you bring
no accusation against Mr. Rand?"

Fairfax Cary looked from under the hand with which, as he sat, he shaded his brow. "I have,
here and now, no sufficient proof whereon to base accusation of any man. I will only say that
I shall seek such proof."

A little longer, and the proceedings were over. The crowd dispersed, unsatisfied, hungry for
further details and hazardous of solutions. Owing to the lack of a country of their own, they
developed, crystallized and idealized their cosmopolitan reasoning faculty. True, they have not
their own empire, but many of them are working for the great moment when the earth will become the home
for all, without distinction of ancestry or race. That is certainly a greater, nobler and sounder
ideal to strive for than a petty nationality.

It is this ideal that is daily attracting larger numbers of Jews, as well as Gentiles; and all
attempts to hinder the realization thereof, like the present nationalistic movement, will be
swept away by the storm that precedes the birth of the new era--mankind clasped in universal
brotherhood.

Mine Owners' Revenge

BY M. B.

+Charles H. Moyer+, President of the Western Federation of Miners, William D. Haywood, Secretary
of that organization, and G. A. Pettibone, former member of the same, were arrested in Denver,
February 17th.

They are accused of having participated in the murder of the ex-Governor of Idaho, Mr. Steunenberg.
Various other arrests have taken place in Cripple Creek and Haines, Oregon.

The events during and after the arrest leave no doubt that the authorities of Colorado and Idaho
are in the most beautiful accord in their attempt to kill the Miners' Union. This accord and
harmony is so apparent that thoughtful citizens cannot fail to see that the governments of
Colorado and Idaho are aiding in the conspiracy of the mine owners against the miners.

Requisition papers and a special train seem to have been prepared in advance, for immediately
after the arrest they were expelled and taken to Boise City, Idaho, and within a few moments
the whole matter was settled by the authorities of Colorado, not even pretending to show the slightest
fairness. Nor did they display the least desire to investigate the grounds upon which requisition
papers were granted. This process usually takes several days. In the case of Moyer, Haywood
and Pettibone a few moments sufficed to close the whole proceedings.

Since the papers were issued before the arrest, it is not at all unlikely that the death sentence
has already been decided upon. Optimists in the labor movement maintain that a repetition of
the legal murder of 1887, that has caused shame and horror even in the ranks of the upper ten
thousand, is impossible--that the authorities would shrink from such an outrage, such an awful
crime. That which has happened in Colorado and Idaho warrants no such hope.

The evidence against the leaders of the Western Federation of Miners consists largely of one individual,
who is supposed to have known and witnessed everything. The gentleman seems to fairly long for
the moment when he can take the witness stand and furnish the material that the District Attorney
needs to prove the guilt of the accused.

An expert perjurer, it seems.

The Governor of Idaho, Mr. Gooding, has already given him a good character.

The man acknowledged his firm belief in the existence of a Supreme
Being, which touched the governor's heart deeply.

Does he not know that it has ever been the mission of the Supreme Being to serve as Impresario
to Falsehood and Wretchedness?

The accusation against the three prisoners is the best affidavit of
the miner magnates of the courageous stand of the Western Federation
of Miners during the reign of terror of the money powers.

For years everything was done to disrupt them, but without results.

The latest outrage is a renewed and desperate attack on that labor organization. Are the working
people of America going to look on coolly at a repetition of the Black Friday in Chicago? Perhaps
there will also be a labor leader, á la Powderly, who will be willing
to carry faggots to the stake?

Or are they going to awaken from their lethargy, ere America becomes
thoroughly Russified?

INTERNATIONAL REVIEW

+A painting+ from the
"good old times" represents two peasants wrangling about a cow. One
holds on to the horns of the animal, the other tightly clutches its
tail, a third figure is in a crouched position underneath. It is the
lawyer milking the cow, while the other two are quarreling. Here we
have the beauty of the representative system. While groups are bargaining
about their rights, their official advisers and lawmakers are skimming
the cream off the milk. Not justice, but social injustice is the incentive
of these worthy gentlemen.

Human justice, and legal representation
thereof, are two different things. One who seeks for a representation
places his rights in the hands of another. He does not struggle for
them himself, he must wait for a decision thereupon from such quarters
as are never inspired by love for justice, but by personal gain and
profit.

The working people are beginning to recognize this. Read it. It is like
her."

He unfolded it and gave it to the Major, who read the line it contained.

     FAIRFAX,--I will marry you to-morrow if you wish. I know--I know it
     is lonely at Greenwood. UNITY.

Major Churchill cleared his throat. "Yes, it is like her. And why not, Fair? Upon my soul,
I do advise it! I advise it strongly. Not to-morrow, perhaps, but next day or the next. It
can be quietly arranged--there could have been no wiser suggestion! Take her at her word, Fair."

Cary shook his head, thrust the note back in its place, and, rising with a quivering sigh,
walked to the window. He stood there for some moments, his brow pressed to the pane, then returned
to the table and, standing before the Major, spoke with harsh passion "Is marriage, sir, a
thing for me to think of now? No! not even marriage with Unity Dandridge. To marry now--to
forget with all possible haste--to lie close and warm and happy and leave him there, cold,
alone, and unavenged! No. I'll not do that. Wedding-bells, even slowly rung, would sound strangely,
I think, to his ears. And as for that murderer, he might say when he heard them, 'Are the dead
so soon forgot? Then up, heart! for this bridegroom will not trouble me.' Major Churchill,
I will live alone at Greenwood until I have proof which will convince a judge and jury that
my brother was not the only man who spurred from that ford by the river road! Lewis Rand may
wind and double, but I'll scotch him yet, there by Indian Run! I'll transfix him there, there
on that very strand, and call the world to see the man who murdered Ludwell Cary! When that's
done, I'll rest, maybe, and think of happiness."

Major Churchill sat back in the deep old armchair and rested his head upon his hand. The hand
was a trembling hand; the old soldier, grey and stark, with his pinned-up sleeve, looked suddenly
a beaten soldier, conquered and fugitive. The young man saw the shaking hand. "You need no
proof, sir," he said harshly. "I know that you know. You knew there beside the stream, the
day we found him."

"Yes, Fair."

"And did you not know that I knew?"

"I have not been perfectly certain, but--yes, I believed you to know."

"I will not say that, knowing me,--for until now I have hardly known myself,--but knowing my
father, sir, could you look for another course from his son? My brother's blood cries from
the ground. There is no rest and no peace for me until his murderer pays!"

"Yes, Fair."

"I cannot tell you what my brother was to me. Brother of the flesh and of the spirit too--David--Jonathan.
His friends mine and his enemies mine, his honour mine--"

"Yes, Fair. It was so I loved Henry Churchill."

The young man checked his speech, gazed at his guest a moment in silence, and turned away.
The quiet held in the old room where bygone Carys looked from the walls, but at last the Major
spoke with violence. "Don't think that I do not hate that man! Spare him, in himself, one iota
of the penalty--not I! Cheat justice, see the law futile to protect an outraged people, stay
the hangman's hand--am I one to will that? No man can accuse me of a forgiving spirit! I, too,
loved your brother; I, too, believe in the blood debt! Ask me of this man himself, and I say,
'Right! Let him have it to the hilt--death and shame!' But--but--"

The Major's voice, high and shaking with passion, broke with a gasp. He had sat erect to speak,
but now he sank back, and with his chin upon his hand looked again mere grey defeat.

Fairfax Cary turned from the window. "I am sorry," he said coldly and harshly. "In a lesser
thing, Major Churchill, that consideration might stop me. It cannot do so, sir, in this."

"I am not asking that it should," answered the other. "I seldom ask too much of this humanity.
You will do what you must, and what you will, and I shall comprehend your motive and your act.
But I will stand clear of you, Fair. After to-day, you plan without my knowledge, and work
without my aid!"

"If it must be so, sir."

"I have called myself," said Major Edward sombrely, "a Spartan and a Stoic. I believe in law
and the payment of debts. I believe that a murderer should be tracked down and shown that civilization
has no need of him. I loved your brother. And I sit here, a weak old man, and say, 'Not if
it strikes through a woman's heart!' What a Stoic the Most High must be!"

"I think that I should know one thing, sir. Is it your belief that he has told your niece?"

The Major grew dark red, and straightened himself with a jerk. "Told my niece? Made her, sir,
a confidante of his villainy, leagued her to aid him in cajoling the world? I think not, sir;
I trust not! I would not believe even him so universal an enemy. If I thought that, sir,--but
no! I have seen my niece Jacqueline twice since--" the Major spoke between his teeth--"since
Mr. Rand's return from Richmond." He sat a moment in silence, then continued. "Her grief is
deep, as is natural--do we not all grieve? But if I have skill to read a face, she carries
in her heart no such black stone as that! Remember, please, that he told her nothing of his
plot with Burr. You will oblige me by no longer indulging such an idea."

"Very well, sir. I know that Colonel Churchill has no suspicion. He contends that it was some
gypsy demon--will not even have it that some poor white from about the still--says that no
man in this county--Well! I, too, would have thought that once."

"My brother Dick has the innocence of a child. But others apparently suspect as little. You
and I are alone there. And we have only the moral conviction, Fairfax. They were enemies, and
they were in the same county on the same day. That is all you have to go upon. He has somehow
made a coil that only the serpent himself can unwind."

"A man can but try, sir. I shall try. If you talk of an inner conviction, I have that conviction
that I shall not try in vain."

Major Edward shaded his eyes with his hand. "God forbid that I should wish the murder of Ludwell
Cary unavenged! But--but--shame and sorrow--and Henry Churchill's child"--He rose from his
chair and stalked across the room. "I am tired of it all," he said, "tired of the world, life,
death, pro and con, affections, hatreds, sweets that cloy, bitterness that does not nourish,
the gash of events, and the salt with which memory rubs the wound! Man that is born of woman--Pah!"
He straightened himself, flung up his grey head, and moved stiffly to a bookcase. "Where's
Gascoigne's Steel Glasse? I know you've got a copy--Ludwell told me so."

"It is on the third shelf, the left side. Major Churchill, you understand that, for all that
has been said, I must yet go my way?"

"Yes, Fair, I understand," said the other. "Do what you must--and God help us all!"

CHAPTER XXXIV

FAIRFAX CARY

The December frost lay hard upon the ground, and a pale winter sky gleamed above and between
bare limbs of trees. In Vinie Mocket's garden withered and bent stalk showed where had been
zinnia and prince's feather, and the grapevine over the porch was but a mass of twisted stems.
The sun shone bright, however, on this day, and as there was no wind, it was not hard to imagine
it warm out-of-doors and the spring somewhere in keeping. It was the week before Christmas,
and the season unwontedly mild.

Vinie, seated upon the doorstep in the sun, a grey shawl around her shoulders and her pink
chin in her hand, stared at the Ragged Mountains and wondered when Tom was coming to dinner.
A grey cat purred in the sun beside her. Smut the dog, lying in a patch of light upon the porch
floor, broke out of a dream, got up, and wagged his tail.

"Who do you hear, Smut?" asked Vinie. "I think it ith Mr. Adam."

Adam came through the gate that had never been mended and up the little, sunny path. He had
his gun, and in addition a great armful of holly and mistletoe, and he deposited all alike
upon the porch floor. "A green Christmas we're having," he announced cheerfully, "so we might
as well make it greener! I thought these would look pretty over your chimney glass."

"They'll be lovely," answered Vinie. "I just somehow didn't think of fixing things up this
Christmas. I'll put them all around the parlour, Mr. Adam."

"I'll put them for you," said Adam. "This isn't mistletoe like you get in the big trees south,
and it isn't holly such as grows down Williamsburgh way--but it's mistletoe and it's holly."

"Yeth," agreed Vinie listlessly. "I don't know which ith the prettier, the little white waxen
berries or the red."

"I like the red," returned the hunter. "That in your hand--bright and quick as blood-drops."

"No," said Vinie, and let the spray drop to the floor. "Blood ith darker than that."

"Not if it's heart's blood--that's bright enough. What is the matter, little partridge?"

"Nothing," Vinie replied, with an effort. "I've been baking cake all morning, and I'm tired.
I reckon you couldn't have Christmas without baking and scrubbing and sweeping and dusting
and making a whole lot of fuss about nothing--nothing at all." Her voice dragged away.

"You couldn't have it without hanging up mistletoe and holly," quoth Adam. "I've been a month
in these parts, and I've come around mighty often to see you and Tom. Why won't you tell me?"

Vinie turned upon him startled eyes. "Tell you?"

"Tell me what ails you. Why, you aren't any more like--Don't you remember that morning, a'most
four years ago, when I found you sitting by the blackberry bushes on the Fontenoy road? Yes,
you do. The blackberries were in bloom, and you had on a pink sunbonnet, and I broke you a
lot of wild cherry for your very same parlour in there. You had been crying that day, too,--oh,
I knew!--but you plucked up spirit and put the wild cherry all around the parlour. And now,
look at you!--you aren't a partridge any longer, you're a dove without a mate. Well, why don't
you cry, little dove?"

"I don't feel like crying," said Vinie. "There isn't anything the matter with me. I'm going
to put the green stuff up, and Tom's got ever so many wax candles and two bottles of Madeira,
and you'll come to supper--"

"I'll send you a brace of wild turkeys Christmas Eve. I'll shoot them over on Indian Run."

Vinie shrank back. "You look," exclaimed Adam, "as though you were on Indian Run, and I had
turned my gun on you! Why did you go white and sick like that?"

He glanced at her again with keen, deep blue eyes. "Now the colour has come back. Were you
frightened over there in those woods when you really were a bird? Indian Run! It is more than
three months, isn't it, since Mr. Cary's death?"

"December," answered Vinie, in a fluttering voice, "December, November, October, and part of
September--yeth, more than three months. Suppose we go now and put the holly up?"

"Let's stay here a little in the sun. The holly won't wither. I don't know a doorstep, East
or West, that I like to sit on better than this. There's a variety of log cabins that I'm fond
of, and maybe as many as four or five wigwams, but I'd like to grow old sitting in the sun
before this little grey house! It isn't going to be long before the sap runs in the sugar trees
and it's spring. Then all the pretty flowers will come up again and I'll help you draw cool
water from the well. Don't you ever wear that Spanish comb I brought you?"

"I've got it put away. It's lovely."

"It oughtn't to be put away. It ought to be stuck there, dark shell above your yellow hair.
You'll wear it, won't you, Christmas Day?"

"Yeth, I'll wear it, Mr. Adam. Who's coming now, Smut?"

"He hears a horse. Wear the Spanish comb, and Tom shall brew us a bowl of punch, and we might
get in some gay folk and a fiddle and have a dance. I'd like to stand up with you, little partridge."

Vinie put down her head and began to cry. "It's nothing, nothing! There isn't anything the
matter! Don't think it, Mr. Adam. I jutht get tired and cold, and Christmas isn't like it used
to be. Now I've stopped--and I'll dance with you with pleasure, Mr. Adam."

"That's right," said Adam. "Now, you dry your eyes, and we'll go into the parlour and I'll
make a fire, and we'll put leaves and berries all around. Who is it coming by? Mr. Fairfax Cary."

"Yeth," answered Vinie. "He rides a black horse."

The hunter glanced at her again. "Little bird," he thought, "your voice didn't use to have
so many notes." Aloud he said, "He's grown to look like his brother. I met him in the road
the other day and we talked awhile. He's too stern and quiet, though. All the time we talked
I was thinking of a Cherokee whom I once met following a war party that had killed his wife.
Fairfax Cary had just the same air as that Indian--still, like an afternoon on a mountain-top.
There's no clue yet as to who shot his brother."

Fairfax Cary, going by on Saladin, lifted his hat to the woman on the porch. "Yes, he's like
that Cherokee," repeated Adam. "Where's he riding?--to Fontenoy, I reckon. Now, little partridge,
let's go make the parlour look like Christmas."

Vinie rose, and the hunter gathered up the green stuff. She spoke again in the same fluttered
voice. "Mr. Adam, do you think--do you think they'll ever find out--"

"Find out who shot Mr. Cary?" asked Gaudylock. "They may--there's no telling. Every day makes
a trail like that more overgrown and hard to read. But if Fairfax Cary is truly like my Cherokee,
I'd not care to be the murderer, even five years and a thousand miles from here and now. You
may be sure the Cherokee got his man. Now you take the mistletoe and I'll take the holly, and
we'll make a Christmas bower to dance in." He raised his great armful and went into the house
singing,--

     "Once I was in old Kentucky,
     Christmas time, by all that's lucky!
     Bear meat, deer meat, coon and possum,
     Apple-jack we did allow some,
               In Kentucky.

     "Roaring logs and whining fiddle,
     Up one side and down the middle!
     Two foot snow and ne'er a flower,--
     But Molly Darke she danced that hour,
               In Kentucky!"

The hunter's surmise was correct. Fairfax Cary rode slowly on upon the old, familiar way to
Fontenoy. All the hills were brown, winter earth and winter air despite the brightness of the
sunshine. A blue stream rippled by, pine and cedar made silhouettes against a tranquil sky,
and crows were cawing in a stubble-field. Cary rode slowly, plodding on with a thoughtful brow.
The few whom he met greeted him respectfully, and he answered them readily enough, then pursued
his way, again in a brown study. The Fontenoy gates were reached at last, and he was about
to bend from his saddle and lift the heavy latch, when a slim black girl in a checked gown
made a sudden appearance in the driveway upon the other side. "I'll open hit, sah! Don' you
trouble. Dar now!"

The gate swung open, Cary rode through, and Deb appeared beside Miranda. "We've been walking
a mile," she announced. "Down the drive and back again, through the hollow, round the garden,
and up to the glass door--that's a mile. Are you going to stay to supper?"

Cary dismounted and walked beside her, his bridle over his arm. "I don't think so, Deb,--not
to-night."

"I wish you would," said Deb wistfully. "You used to all the time, and you most never do now.
And--and it's Christmas, and we aren't going to decorate, or have a party, or people staying!"
Deb's chin trembled. "I don't like houses in mourning."

"Neither do I, Deb."

The colour streamed into his companion's small face. "I didn't mean--I didn't mean--I forgot!
Oh, Mr. Fairfax,--"

"Dear Deb, don't mind. I wish you were going to have a Christmas as bright as bright! Won't
there be any brightness for you?"

"Why, of course," answered Deb, with bravery. "I am going to have a lovely time. Uncle Dick
says I can do what I please with the schoolroom, and Miranda and I and the quarter children--we're
going to decorate. Unity's going to show us how, and Scipio's going to put up the wreaths.
The quarter's to have its feast just the same, and I'm going to help Unity give out the presents.
I expect it will be beautiful!"

The two walked on, Miranda following. Cary took the child's hand. "I expect it will be beautiful
too, Deb. Sometimes ever so much brightness in just a little place makes up for the grey all
around. Aren't you going to let me see the schoolroom?"

"Oh, would you like to?" cried Deb, brightening. "Certainly, Mr. Fairfax. Christmas is lovely,
isn't it? Unity says that maybe she and I will slip down to the quarter and watch them dancing.
I'm sure I don't want parties, nor people staying!"

Deb squeezed her companion's hand, and kept silence from the big elm to the lilac-bushes. Then
she broke out. "But I don't understand--I don't understand at all--"

Cary, looking down upon her, saw her little pointed chin quiver again, and her brown eyes swim.
"What don't you understand, poor little Deb?"

"I don't understand why I can't go to Roselands. I've always gone the day after every Christmas,
and it is always like Christmas over again! And now Uncle Dick says, 'Stay at home, chicken,
this year,' and Uncle Edward says he needs me to tell him stories, and Unity begged them at
first to let me go, but when they wouldn't, she said that she couldn't beg them any more, and
that she didn't think the world was going right anyhow." The tears ran over. "And Jacqueline,"
continued Deb, in a stifled little voice,--"Jacqueline wrote me a letter and said not to come
this year if Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward wanted me at home. She told me I must always obey
and love them--just as if I didn't anyhow. She said she loved me more than most anything, but
I don't think that is loving me--to think I'd better not come to Roselands. She said I was
most a woman, and so I am,--I'm more than twelve,--and that I was to love her always and know
that she loved me. Of course I shall love Jacqueline always--but I wanted to go to Roselands."
Deb felt in her pocket, found a tiny handkerchief, and applied it to her eyes. "It's not like
Christmas not to go to Roselands the day after--and I think people are cruel."

"I wouldn't think that of your sister, Deb," said Cary, with gentleness. "Your sister isn't
cruel. Don't cry."

"I'm not," answered Deb, and put carefully away a wet ball of handkerchief. "I hope you'll
like the schoolroom, Mr. Fairfax. It's all cedar and red berries, and Miranda's and my dolls
are sitting in the four corners. It's lovely weather for Christmas--though I wanted it to snow."

Major Edward, seated at an old desk, going over old papers, looked up as Cary entered the library.
A fire of hickory crackled and flamed on the hearth, making a light to play over the portrait
of Henry Churchill and over the swords crossed beneath. An old hound named Watch slept under
the table, the tall clock ticked loudly, and through the glass doors, beyond the leafless trees,
showed the long wave of the Blue Ridge.

"Is it you, Fair?" demanded the Major. "Come in--come in! I am merely going over old letters.
They can wait. The men who wrote them are all dead." He turned in his chair. "Have you just
come in?"

"Yes, sir."

"Unity was here awhile ago. She went through the glass door--down to the quarter, I suppose."

"I will stay here for a while, sir, if I may. Don't let me disturb you. I will take a book."

"You do not disturb me," answered the Major. "I was reading a letter from Hamilton, written
long ago--long ago.

"I met Deb in the driveway and we walked to the house together. Poor little maid! She is mightily
distressed because she thinks there's a lack of Christmas cheer. I wish, sir, that she might
have a merry Christmas."

"We'll do our best, Fair. Unity shall make it bright."

"The servants, too,--I give mine the usual feast at Greenwood, and I'm going down to the quarter
for half an hour."

"The Carys make good masters. In that respect all here, too, goes on as usual. As for Deb,
the child shall have the happiest day we can give her." He took from a drawer a small morocco
case and opened it. "She'll have from Dick a horse and saddle, and I give her this." He held
out the case, and Cary praised the small gold watch with D.C. marked in pearls. "The only thing,"
continued Major Edward wearily, "is that she cannot go to Roselands. She has cried her heart
out over that."

"You declined the invitation for her?"

"Yes. I made Dick do so. She is growing into womanhood. It will not answer."

"Then, sir, Colonel Churchill must know--"

"He doesn't 'know,'" said the Major doggedly. "Nobody really knows. We may be all pursuing
a spectre. I told Dick enough to make him see that Deb should not be brought into contact--"

There was a silence. Cary studied the fire, and Major Churchill unfolded deftly with his one
hand a yellowing paper, glanced over it, and laid it in a separate drawer. "An order from General
Washington--the André matter. Deb shall not visit Roselands again. Dick and I are not going
to have both of Henry's children"--The Major's voice broke. "Pshaw! this damned weather gives
a man a cold that Valley Forge itself couldn't give!" He unfolded another paper. "What's this?
Benedict Arnold! Faugh!" Rising, he approached the fire and threw the letter in, then turned
impatiently upon the younger man. "Well, Fairfax Cary?"

"Is it still," asked Cary slowly, "your opinion that she does not know?"

"She?"

"Mrs. Rand."

Major Edward dragged a chair to the corner of the hearth and sat heavily down. He bent forward,
a brooding, melancholy figure, a thin old veteran, grey and scarred. The fire-light showed
strongly square jaw, hawk nose, and beetle brows. When he spoke, it was in a voice inexpressibly
sombre. "I have seen my niece but three times since September. If you ask me now what you asked
me then, I shall answer differently. I do not know--I do not know if she knows or not!"

"I think, sir, that I have a clue. The hour when he passed Red Fields--"

Major Churchill put up a shaking hand. "No, sir! Remember our bargain. I'll not hear it. I'll
weigh no evidence on this subject. Enough for me to know in my heart of hearts that this man
murdered Ludwell Cary, and that he dwells free at Roselands, blackening my niece--that he rides
free to town--pleads his cases--does his work--ingratiates himself, and grows, grows in the
esteem of his county and his state! That, I say, is enough, sir! If you have your clue, for
God's sake don't impart it to me! I've told you I will not make nor meddle." Major Edward began
to cough. "Open the window, will you? The room is damned hot. Well, sir, well?"

"I'll say no more, then, sir, as to that," Cary answered from the window. "I wish absolutely
to respect your position. It will do no harm, however, to tell you that I am going to Richmond
the day after Christmas."

"To Richmond! What are you going to Richmond for?"

"I want," replied the other, with restrained passion,--"I want to ride from Shockoe Hill at
three o'clock in the afternoon, with my face to Roselands, and in my heart the knowledge that
I have been foiled and thwarted in deep-laid and cherished schemes by the one whom, for no
especially good reason, I have singled out of the world to be my enemy! I want to feel the
black rage of the Rands in my heart. I want to sleep, the third night, at the Cross Roads Tavern,
and I want to go on in the morning by Malplaquet I want to learn at Forrest's forge that Ludwell
Cary is on the road before me. Perhaps, by the time I reach the mill and cross the ford, I
will remember what it was that I did next, and how I managed to be on two roads at once."

He turned, and took up from a chair his hat and riding-whip "'Tis no easy feat," he said, with
grimness, "to put one's self in the place of Lewis Rand. But then, other things are not easy
either. I'll not grudge a little straining." He stood before the Major, holding out his hand--a
handsome figure in his mourning dress, resolute, quiet, no longer breathing outward grief,
ready even, when occasion demanded, to smile or to laugh, but essentially altered and fixed
to one point. "I think, sir, I will look now for Unity. There is something I wish to say to
her. Good-bye, sir. I shall not come again until after New Year."

Miss Dandridge, mounting the hill from the quarter, and sitting down to rest upon a great,
sun-bathed stone beside the foot-path, heard a quick step and looked up to greet her betrothed.
"It is so warm and bright," she said, "in this fence-corner that I feel as though summer were
on the way. The stone is large--there's room for you, too, here in the sunshine."

He sat down beside her. "You have been making Christmas for the quarter?"

"I've been telling them that Christmas is to be bright. I have not seen you for a week."

He took her hand and pressed it to his lips. "Unity, I have been sitting there at home at Greenwood,
thinking, thinking! Page came to see me, but I was such poor company that he did not tarry
long. I rode here to-day to say something to you--Unity, don't you think you had better give
me up?"

"No! I don't--"

"I do not think it is fair to you. I am not the man you knew--except in loving you I am not
the man who sat with you beneath the catalpa. I am bereaved of the better part of me, and I
see one object held up before me like a wand. I must reach that wand or all effort is fruitless,
and there is no achievement and no harvest in my life. I may be years in reaching it. I love
you dearly and deeply, but I am not given over to love. I am given over to reaching that wand.
It has seemed to me, sitting there at Greenwood, it has seemed to me after Page's visit, that
I should give you freedom--"

"It seems to me, sitting here upon this stone," answered Unity, "that I will not take it! And
what under the sun Mr. Page's visit--I will wait until you are at leisure to love me as--as--as
you loved me that day under the catalpa when you flung Eloïsa to Abelard into the rosebushes!
Don't--don't! I like to cry a little."

"I have determined," he said, "to tell you what I am doing. You know that I seek to discover
my brother's murderer, but you have not guessed that I know his name. It is Lewis Rand whom
I pursue, and it is Lewis Rand whom I will convict of that deed on Indian Run!"

She gave a cry. "Lewis Rand! Fair, Fair, that's impossible!"

"Is it?" he asked sombrely. "Impossible to prove, perhaps, though I'm not prepared to grant
that either, but true, Unity, true as many another black 'impossible' has been!"

"But--but--No one thinks--no one suspects. Fair, Fair! are you not mistaken?"

"No. Nor am I quite alone in my conviction. And one day the world that suspects nothing shall
know."

There was a silence; then, "But Jacqueline," she whispered, with whitening lips. "Jacqueline"--

"She chose," he answered. "I cannot help it. She took her road and her companion."

"And you mean--you mean--"

"I mean to bring him to justice."

"To break her heart and ruin her life--to bring down wretchedness, misery, disgrace! Oh!" She
caught her breath. "And Deb--and Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward--Fair, Fair, leave him alone!"

"You must not ask me that."

"But Ludwell would--Ludwell would have asked it! Oh, do you think he would have endured to
bring woe like that upon her! Oh, Fair, Fair,--"

Cary sprang to his feet, walked away, and stood with his back to the great stone and his face
toward Greenwood. He saw but one thing there, the graveyard on the hill beneath the leafless
trees. When he came back to Unity, he looked as he had looked beside the dead, that day on
Indian Run.

"We are alike, Ludwell and I," he said, "but we are not that much alike. I am little now but
an avenger of blood. I shall be that until this draws to an end." He came closer and touched
her shoulder with his hand. "Take me or leave me as I am, Unity. I shall not change, not even
for you."

"But for tenderness," she cried, "for mercy, for consideration of an old house, for Jacqueline
whom your brother loved as you love--as once you said you loved--me! For just pity, Fair!"

"On the other side," he answered, "is justice. Don't urge me, Unity. That is something your
uncle has not done."

"Uncle Edward?"

"Yes."

There was a silence; then, "I see now," said Unity slowly. "I haven't understood. I thought--I
didn't know what to think. Uncle Edward, too,--oh me! oh me! That is why Deb is not to go to
Roselands." She considered through blinding tears a little patch of sere grass. "But Jacqueline,"
she whispered,--"Jacqueline does not know?"

Cary looked at her. "Do you think that, Unity?"

Unity stared at the grass until the tears all dried. "She knows--she knows! That was a heart-breaking
letter to Deb, and I couldn't--I couldn't understand it! She does not ask me there--does not
seem to want to meet--I've hardly seen her since--since--And when we meet, she's strange--too
gay at first for her, and then too still, with wide eyes she will not let me read. And she
talks and talks--she talks now more than I do. She's not truly Jacqueline--she's acting a part.
Oh, Jacqueline, Jacqueline!"

"Be very sure," he said, "that I have for her only pity, admiration, yes, and understanding!"

"But you intend--you intend--"

"To bring Lewis Rand to justice. Yes, I intend that."

From the quarter below them came the blowing of the afternoon horn. The short, bright winter
day was waning, and though the sun yet dwelt upon the hill-top, the hollow at its base was
filled with shadow. Unity rose from the stone. "I must go back to the house. I promised Deb
I would read to her." She caught her breath. "It is the Arabian Nights--and he gave it to her,
and she's always talking of him. Oh, all of us poor children! Oh, I used to think the world
so sweet and gay!"

"What do you think," he said, "of the one who turns it bitter?"

She looked at him with pleading eyes. "Fair, Fair, will you not forego it--forego vengeance?"

"It is not vengeance," he answered. "It is something deeper than that. I don't think that I
can explain. It seems to me that it is destiny and all that destiny rests upon." He drew her
to him and kissed her twice. "Will you wait for me, wait on no other terms than these? If you
will, God bless you! If it is a task beyond your strength, God bless you still. You will do
right to give it up. Which, Unity, which? And if you wait for me, you must go no more to that
man's house. If you wait for me, my brother is your brother."

"I will never give up Jacqueline!"

"I do not ask it. But you'll go no more to that house, speak no more to the man she most unhappily
wedded. That is my right--if you wait for me."

She turned and threw herself into his arms. "Oh, Fair, if it is only he himself--if it is only
that dark and wicked man--if you do not ask me to stop loving her, or writing to her, or seeing
her when I can--"

"That is all--only to speak no more to that dark and wicked man."

"Then I'll wait--I'll wait till doomsday! Oh, the world! Oh, the thing called love! Don't--don't
speak to me until I cry it out."

She wept for a while, then dried her eyes and tried to smile. "That's over. Let us go now and--and
read the Arabian Nights. Oh me, oh me, if we are not merry here, what must Christmas be at
Roselands!"

CHAPTER XXXV

THE IMAGE

The murderer of Ludwell Cary unlocked the green door of the office in Charlottesville, entered,
and opened the shutters of the small, square windows. Outside was a tangle of rose-stems, but
no leaf or bloom. The January sunshine streamed palely in, whitening the deal floor and striking
against a great land map on the wall. Upon the hearth had been thrown an armful of hickory
and pine. Rand, kneeling, laid a fire, struck a spark into the tinder, and had speedily a leap
and colour of pointed flames. He rose, opened his desk, drew papers out of pigeon-holes and
laid them in order upon the wood, then pushed before it his accustomed chair. He did not take
the latter; instead, after standing a moment with an indescribable air of weary uncertainty,
he turned, went back to the firelit hearth, sat down, and, bending forward, hid his face in
his hands.

A cricket began to chirp upon the hearth, then the branch of a sycamore, moved by the wind,
struck violently against the low eaves of the house. Rand arose, put his hands to his temples,
and moved away.

There were law-books on the shelves, and he took down one and fell to studying statutes that
bore upon a case he had in court. He read for a time with a frown of attention, but by degrees
all interest flagged. He turned a page, looked at it with vagueness, and turned no more. His
chin fell upon his hand, and he sat staring at the patch of sunshine on the floor. It was like
light on water--light on Indian Run.

Five minutes more and Mocket came in, soft and quick upon his feet, sandy-haired and freckle-faced,
with his quaint, twisted smile, and watery blue eye, that glanced aslant at his friend and
partner "Good-morning, Lewis"

"Good-morning, Tom."

Mocket stood by the fire, warming his hands. "If 'twas a mild December, 'tis cold enough now!
The wind is icy, and it's blowing hard."

"Is it? I thought the air was still."

As he spoke, Rand arose, replaced the book on the shelf, sat down at his desk, and began to
unfold papers. "Work!" he said presently, in a dull voice. "Work! That is the straw at which
to catch! Perhaps one might make of it a raft to bear one's weight. I have known the day when
in work I have forgotten hunger, thirst, weariness, calamity. I have worked at night and grudged
an hour to sleep. What I have done, cannot I do again? But I would work better, Tom, if I could
get some sleep."

"I am sorry you have bad nights," said Tom; "but if you slept as deep and innocent as a babe,
you couldn't do better work. That was a praising piece about you in the Enquirer."

"Nothing less than eulogy, Tom, nothing less! Well--get to work! Get to work!"

"I've brought the papers on this case that old Berry has been copying." Tom threw more wood
on the fire, then moved to his own desk, dragging a chair after him. "By the way, I stopped
at the Eagle for a dram to keep out the cold, and who should come riding by but Fairfax Cary--"

"Ah!" said Rand. "Is he home from Richmond?"

"I didn't know that he had been to Richmond."

"Yes. He went two weeks ago."

"I hadn't observed it. Well, whenever he went, he's back again. As I say, I was coming down
the steps, buttoning up my coat, and he drew rein--he was riding his brother's horse and he
looked like his brother--and he says to me, says he, 'Mr. Mocket,--'"

Tom broke off, turned the papers in his hand, and uttered an exclamation of disgust. "Old Berry
is getting to be too poor a copyist! You'll have to give this work somewhere else."

Rand spoke in his measured voice. "What did Fairfax Cary say, Tom?"

"Why, he didn't say much, and I'm sure I didn't get any meaning out of what he did say! His
words were, 'Mr. Mocket, I wish I could remember all that, on several occasions, I must have
said to you.' Seeing," continued Tom, "that I haven't spoken to him more than a dozen times
in my life, I shouldn't consider there would be much difficulty in that, and I told him as
much. 'You're mistaken,' he said. 'It is difficult. We all have bad memories. I've been wondering,
seeing that I have talked to you of so much, if I ever talked to you of that. On the whole,
I don't think that I ever have. Cultivate your memory, Mr. Mocket. Mine is a damnably poor
one.' And so," ended Tom, "he rode away and left me staring. I don't know whether his head
is turned or not, but he looked strong enough for anything and all a Cary. If you know what
he meant, it is more than I do. These reports are all straight enough now. Do you want to look
over them?"

"No," said his partner, and stood up, moving back his chair with a grating sound. "I don't
know why--I'm restless to-day." Walking across the room, he stopped before the map upon the
wall, and stood there a long while in silence.

"How would it do, Tom," he asked at last, in a curiously remote and dreamy voice,--"how would
it do to find two or three great white-covered waggons, store them with all a childless family
would need, put to them teams sound and strong, procure a horse or two besides, a slave or
two, a faithful dog,--then to take the long road--west--south--somewhere--anywhere--past the
mountains and away, away"--His voice sank, then gathered strength and went on. "Flood and forest,
low hills and endless plains, stillness and a measure of peace! Left behind the demon care,
full before the eye the red, descending sun--at night the camp-fire, at dawn the start, and
in between mere sleep without a dream! It is conceivable that, after much travel, in some hollow
or by some spring, after long days and after sleep, one might stumble on new life." He struck
the map with his hand. "Tom, sometimes I think that I will remove from Virginia to the West."

"You'd be a fool to do that now," answered Tom succinctly. "But you won't do it. I don't know
what has been the matter with you this winter, but I reckon you still love power. Next year
you'll be named for Governor of Virginia."

He fed the fire again, then, going to the window, looked down the street. "The wind has fallen."

"I am going," said Rand's voice behind him, "to ride down the Three-Notched Road. Mrs. Selden
sends me word that old Carfax is annoying her again."

"Can't I go for you?"

"No. I do not mind the ride. Get the papers ready for court to-morrow."

Mocket helped him on with his heavy bottle-green riding-coat. "Lewis," spoke the scamp, with
a queer note of affection and deprecation, "why don't you see Dr. Gilmer? You're growing thin,
and do you know, you're haunted-looking! Tell him you cannot sleep, and make him give you bark
or something. I couldn't carry on business without you, you know."

Rand looked at him with dark and sombre eyes. "Couldn't you, poor old Tom? Well, we'll keep
it on awhile together. I don't want the doctor. Once, long ago, I might have doctored myself."
He laughed. "Now there's no bark in Peru--no balm in Gilead. Well, what we cannot have, we
must do without! Look out, will you, and see if Young Isham is there with Selim?"

The Three-Notched Road stretched red and stark between rusty cedars and gaunt trunks of locust
trees. It was cold, and overhead the sun was fighting with the clouds. Rand went rapidly, his
powerful horse taking the road with a long and easy stride. Few were abroad; the bare and frozen
fields stretched on either hand to the hills, the hills rose to the mountains, grey and sullen
in the changing light. That meadow, field, and hill had once been mantled with tender verdure,
and would be so again, was hard to believe, the land lay so naked and so grim.

Mrs. Selden's small, red brick mansion appeared among the leafless trees. Rand checked Selim
slightly, gazing at the place with the weary uncertainty he had before exhibited, then turned
for the moment from the task, irksome now as were all tasks, and rode on past Mrs. Jane Selden's
to the house in which he had lived with his father and mother, and had lived with Jacqueline.

The place had been rented out since that summer of 1804, but the tenant, failing to make good,
was gone, and for some months the house had been vacant. Rand and Selim moved slowly along
the old, old familiar way. Every stick, every stone, every fence-corner was known to both.
The man let his hand fall upon the brute's neck. "We're going home, Selim," he said. "We're
going home."

It was not now the small, clean place, fresh with whitewash and bright with garden flowers,
shone upon by the sun and sung about by birds, to which he had brought Jacqueline. The tenant
had been dull, and the place was fallen into disrepair. In the winter air and without a leaf
or flower, it looked again as it had looked when he and Gideon lived there alone. He dismounted,
fastened Selim to the fence, and entered by the gate beneath the mimosa tree.

That the mimosa had ever shown sensitive leaf and mist of rosy bloom ranked now among other
impossibilities. He stood for a moment looking at it in silence, then walked up the narrow
path, mounted the porch steps, and tried the door. It was locked, but with an effort of all
his wasted strength he burst it open and so entered the house.

The rooms were unfurnished and forlorn. He went from one to another, pausing in each in the
middle of the floor, and gazing around as if to replace in that empty square the objects of
the past. This progress made, he looked for a place to rest, but there was neither chair nor
bench. All was bare, unswept, and desolate. He went into the kitchen, for he remembered the
old settle there upon the enormous hearth. That they could not have removed, it was too heavy.
He found it, took off his riding-coat and made a pillow for his head, then lay down full length
upon the time-darkened wood. He had lain so, often and often, a little boy, a larger boy, a
long-limbed, brooding youth. It had been his refuge from the fields, though hardly a refuge
from his father. Gideon had been always there, lounging in his chair on the other side of the
hearth, black pipe in hand, heavy stick beside him, revolving in his slow-moving mind, there
in the dusk after the day's work, tobacco--tobacco--tobacco--and how he should keep Lewis from
learning. "It had been better if he had succeeded," said Rand aloud.

With Gideon still before his eyes he fell asleep. Grim as was that figure, there was in the
vision of it a strange sense of protection. It was his father, and, giddy from want of sleep,
he sank slowly into oblivion, much as before now he had travelled there in the other's presence,--travelled
with a gloomy mind and a body sore from the latest beating. Now the mind was full of scorpions,
and the body stood in deadly need of sleep. It took it with a strange reversion to long gone-by
conditions. The thought of Gideon's stick, the feel of his heavy hand upon his shoulder, were
with him as of yore. The difference was that the man was comforted by what had been the boy's
leaden cross.

Exhausted as he was, he slept at first heavily, and without a dream. This state lasted for
some time, but eventually the brain took up its work, and the visions that plagued him recommenced.
He turned, flung out his arm, moaned once or twice, lay quiet, then presently gave a cry and
started up, pale and trembling, the sweat upon his brow. He wiped it off, drew a long, shuddering
breath, and sat staring.

The kitchen windows were small, and half darkened by their wooden shutters. While he slept,
the day had rounded into an afternoon, with more of sunshine than the morning had contained.
The gold entered the room uncertainly, dimly, filtering in by the small apertures and striking
across to the cavernous fireplace.

Rand knew it was but a trick of the light touching here and there in mote-filled shafts,--a
trick of the light aiding the vagaries of an overwrought brain. He put forth his arm and found
that it was so--there was no chair there and no figure seated in the chair. It was a trick
of the light and an effect of imagination, an imagination that was hounded, day by day, from
depth to pinnacle, from pinnacle to depth, back and forth like a shuttlecock in giant hands.
No chair was there and no seated figure. He sank back on the settle and found that he saw them
both.

The first sick leap of the heart was past. What he saw, he knew, was a mere effect of light
and shadow and tragically heightened fancy: when he moved in a certain direction, the dim picture
faded, broke into pieces, was gone; but lean far back in the settle, look out with eyes of
one awakened from a maze of fearful dreams, and there it was again! He had no terror of it;
what was it at last but the projection of a face and form with which his mind had long--had
long been occupied? It had ousted the vision of his father; and that, too, was not strange,
seeing that, day by day, the thought of the one--the one--the one had grown more and yet more
insistent. "Cary," said Rand, in a hollow voice, "Cary!"

The light and shadow made no answer. Rand waited, gazing with some fixedness, and imagination
at white heat saw the head, the face, the form, the quiet dress, the whole air of the man,
the look within his eyes and the smile upon his lips. The figure sat at ease, as of old it
had sat upon the Justice's Bench the day of the election, as it had sat beside the bed in the
blue room at Fontenoy. Imagination laid Lewis Rand again in that room, showed him the mandarin
screen, the sunny, happy morning, the pansies in the bowl. "If," he cried,--"if I had died
then, I had not died a wicked man. Cary--Cary--Cary! I am in torment!"

There came no reply. Rand bowed his head. Without, in the afternoon sky, a cloud hid the sun.
When the solitary man in the deserted house looked again, there were no shafts of light, no
dark between to create illusion; all was even dusk, forbidding, grey, and cold. He rose from
the settle and left the room and the house. Selim whinnied at the gate, and his master, coming
swiftly down the path and out of the enclosure, unknotted the reins, mounted, and rode off
at speed.

Rand's haste did not hold. Remorse does not necessarily break habit, and the habit of his lifetime
was attention to detail, system in matters of business, scrupulous response to the call where
he acknowledged the right. He drew rein at Mrs. Selden's, dismounted, and lifted the knocker.

Cousin Jane Selden herself met him in the hail. "Lewis! I'm as glad to see you as if you brought
the south wind! Come in to the fire, and I'll ring for cake and wine. It is bitter weather
even for January. All's well at Roselands?"

"All's well."

They entered the small parlour and sat down before the fire. "I saw Jacqueline," continued
Mrs. Selden, "at church last Sunday. I thought her looking very badly pale and absent. I know,
Lewis Rand, that you love each other dearly. There has been no quarrel?"

"No quarrel."

"I don't know," quoth Mrs. Selden, "of which I'm most sensible when it's in the air--an east
wind or something amiss. The wind's in the north to-day, but the latter's on my mind. What
is wrong, Lewis?"

"My dear old friend, what should be wrong?"

"That is what I asked you."

"Then nothing," he replied, "nothing but the north wind. Now about Carfax--"

Advice given on the subject of all dealings with Carfax, the adviser rose to take his leave.
Mrs. Selden removed her spectacles and laid them in her key-basket. It was a sign with her
that she was about to speak her mind.

"Lewis," she said, "I was a good friend to you once."

"Do I not know that?" he answered. "The best friend a poor boy ever had."

"No, not quite that--except, perhaps, to help you a little with Jacqueline. Mr. Jefferson was
the best friend a poor boy ever had."

Rand winced. "You say true. The best friend a boy could have. Give me another glass of wine,
and then I'll go."

"A man like that during youth and a woman like Jacqueline for your manhood--you have had much
to prop your life."

"Yes. Very much."

"Then," she said sharply, "don't let it fall. Grow upward, Lewis, like the vine that gave its
strength to make this generous wine! If you don't, you'll disappoint your Maker, to say nothing
of some poor earthly friends! Don't fall--don't run upon the earth like poison oak. You're
meant for noble uses--to help your kind, and to rejoice the heart of the Maker of strong men.
Don't you fail and fall, Lewis Rand!"

Rand paused before her. "How should I help my kind, now--now?"

His old friend looked at him a little wonderingly. "Do the simple right, my dear, whatever
it is that you see before you."

"The simple right! And to rejoice the heart of my Maker--if I have one?"

"Do the right strongly and surely, Lewis."

"Whatever it is?"

"Whatever it is." Mrs. Jane Selden looked at him thoughtfully, her hands clasped upon her key-basket.
"I'm only an old woman--just a camp-follower with an interest in the battle. I wish that you
had had a friend of your own age--a man, and your equal in power and grasp. Gaudylock and Mocket
and such--they're well enough, but you're high above them, you're a sort of Emperor to them.
Could you but have had such a friend, Lewis--a man like the Carys--"

"For God's sake, don't!" cried Rand hoarsely. He poured out a glass of wine, looked at it,
and pushed it away. "I will go now, for there is work waiting for me in town, and at home Do
as I tell you about Carfax. Good-bye, good-bye!"

Out upon the road, passing through a strip of pine and withered scrub, he raised his hand,
and for some moments covered his eyes. When he dropped it, he saw, in the strong purples of
the winter evening, again that misty figure, riding this time, riding near him, not in the
road, but apparent in the air against and between the tall trunks of pines. "Cary," he said
again, "Cary!"

There was no response from the figure in the air. "Cary," cried Rand, "I would we had been
friends!"

Selim reached the open country; the pines fell away, the form was gone. Rand touched his horse
with the spur and rode fast between brown stubble-fields darkening to the hills and to the
evening sky. "Friends," he repeated, "friends! That would be on terms of my doing the simple
right--the simple right after the most complicated wrong! Terms! there are no terms."

Leaving the fields, he rode down to a stream, crossed it, and saw the shape against a pale
space of evening sky. "Is it to be always thus?" he thought. "I would that I had never been born."

CHAPTER XXXVI

IN PURSUIT

January passed and February passed. Fairfax Cary, riding for the third time since the New Year
from Malplaquet toward Greenwood, marked the blue March sky, the pale brown catkins by the
brooks, and the white flowers of the bloodroot piercing the far-spread carpet of dead leaves.
He rode rapidly, but he paused at Forrest's forge and at the mill below the ford. This also
he had done before. Neither the smith nor the men at the mill knew the idea that brought him
there, but they may have thought--if they thought at all--that he put strange questions. It
was, moreover, matter of regret to them, and of much comment when he had passed, that Mr. Fairfax
Cary had lost an old and well-liked way of making a man laugh whether he would or no. He didn't
jest any more, he didn't smile and flash out something at them fit to make them hold their
sides. He had aged ten years since September, he had the high look of the Carys, but he was
even quieter than his brother had been--all the sparkle and play dashed out as by a violent
hand. The smith and the men at the mill thought it a great pity, shook their heads as they
looked after him, then fell again to work, or to mere happy lounging in the first spring airs.

The lonely horseman crossed the ford below the mill, drew rein beneath the guide-post, and
halted there for some minutes, deep in thought. At last, with a shake of the head and an impatient
sigh, he spoke to Saladin, and once again they took the main road. "It is the third time,"
thought the rider. "There is luck in the third time."

The quiet highroad, wide and sunny, seemed to mock him, and the torn white clouds sailing before
the March wind might have been a beaten navy, carrying with it a wreck of hope. The gusty air
brought a swirl of sere leaves across his path, and the dust rose chokingly. "Caw! caw!" sounded
the crows from a nearby field. The dust fell, the wind passed, the road lay quiet and bright.
"Never!" said Cary between his teeth. "I will never give up!"

Half an hour's riding, and he came in sight of a small ordinary, its low porch flush with the
road, a tall gum tree standing sentinel at the back, and on the porch steps a figure which,
on nearer approach, he recognized as that of the innkeeper. He rode up, dismounted, and fastened
Saladin to the horse-rack, then walked up to and greeted a weight of drowsy flesh, centre to
a cloud of tobacco smoke, and wedded for life to the squat bottle and deep glass adorning the
step beside it.

"Good-morning, Mr. Cross."

The innkeeper stirred, removed his pipe, steadied himself by a hand upon the step, and turned
a dull red face upon the speaker. "Morning, Mr.--Mr. Cary! Which way did you come, sir? I never
heard you."

"I came up from the ford. You were asleep, I think."

Mr. Cross denied the imputation. "Not at this hour, sir, never at this hour--not at ten o'clock
in the morning, sir! Later, maybe, when I've had my grog, I'll take my forty winks--"

"It is not ten o'clock. It is nearly twelve, Mr. Cross."

"Well, well!" returned Mr. Cross, whose face, blushing all the time, showed at no particular
instant any particular discomfiture. "I must just have dropped off a bit. There's little business
nowadays, and a man had better sleep than do worse! What'll you have, sir? I'll call my girl
Sally to serve you.

"Nothing at the moment, Mr. Cross." Cary sat down upon the step beside the other. "I stopped
here a month ago--"

"You did," answered the innkeeper. "You stopped in January, too, didn't you?"

"Yes. In January."

"I remember plain. You wanted to know this and you wanted to know that, but you certainly treated
me handsome, sir, and I'm far from grudging you any information Joe Cross can give!"

"We will go back to the same subject," said Cary. "Any recompense in my power to make I should
consider but your due, Mr. Cross, could you tell me--could you tell me what I want to know."

He had spoken at first guardedly, but at last with an irresistible burst of feeling. The innkeeper
looked at him with dull wonder. "I'd do anything to oblige ye, Mr. Cary, I certainly would!
But when we come to talking about the road, and who goes by, and who doesn't go by, and about
the seventh of September, and wasn't I asleep and dreaming just before the big storm broke?--why,
I say, sir, No! I don't think I was. 'Tween man and man, Mr. Cary, I don't mind telling your
father's son, sir, that 'tis possible I might ha' had a drop more than usual, and ha' been
asleep earlier! The holy Apostles Barnabas and Paul, by the performance of a striking miracle,
had excited feelings of religious reverence and devotion among the people of Lystra, who prepared
to offer sacrifice to them as two of their fabled deities. [Acts xiv. 11-18.] The indignant
zeal with which these two holy men rushed forward to prevent such
an act of impiety, however admirable and affecting, does not constitute
the chief point for which reference is here made to this incident.

They were men, still clothed with the tabernacle of the flesh, and
the weakness of human nature; and the priests and people were ready
to offer to them the wonted victims, the abomination of the heathen.

Now, I am fully aware of the wide difference, in many {54} particulars, between such an act and
the act of a Christian praying to their spirits after their departure hence, and supplicating
them to intercede with the true God in his behalf: and on this difference Roman Catholic writers
have maintained the total inapplicability of this incident to the present state of things.
But, surely, if any such prayer to departed saints had been familiar to their minds, instead of
repelling the religious address of the inhabitants of Lystra at once
and for ever, they would have altered the tone of their remonstrance,
and not have suppressed the truth when a good opportunity offered
itself for imparting it.

And, supposing that it was part of their commission to announce and explain the invocation of saints
at all, on what occasion could an explanation of the just and proper invocation of angels and
saints departed have been more appropriate in the Apostles, than when they were denouncing the
unjustifiable offering of sacrifice to themselves while living?

But whether the more appropriate place for such an announcement were at Lystra, in Corinth,
at Athens, or at Rome, it matters not; nor whether it would have been more advantageously
communicated by their oral teaching, or in their epistles. Doubtless, had the Apostles, by
their example or teaching, sanctioned the invocation of saints and angels, in the course of
fifty years or more after our blessed Saviour's resurrection, it
would infallibly have appeared in some page or other of the New Testament.

Instead of this the whole tenor of the Holy Volume breathes in perfect accordance with the spirit
of the apostolical remonstrance at Lystra, to the fullest and utmost extent of its meaning,
"We preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities to serve the living God." {55}

Of
the other instance, it well becomes every Catholic Christian to ponder
on the weight and cogency.

John, the beloved disciple of our Lord, when admitted to view with his own eyes and hear with
his mortal ears the things of heaven, rapt in amazement and awe, fell down to worship before the feet
of the angel who showed him these things.

[Rev. xxii. 8, 9.] If the adoration of angels were ever justifiable, surely it was then; and
what a testimony to the end of the world would have been put upon record, had the adoration
of an angel by the blessed John at such a moment, when he had the mysteries and the glories of heaven
before him, been received and sanctioned. But what is the fact?

I cannot understand the criticism by which the conclusiveness of this direct renouncement of all religious
adoration and worship is attempted to be set aside. To my mind these words, uttered without
any qualification at such a time, by such a being, to such a man,
are conclusive beyond gainsaying.



"I have visited," answered Mr. Hunter, "New York and the Eastern Shore. You are looking well,
Cary; better than you did at Christmas. I was in this quarter, and so I thought I would stop
at Greenwood."

The two rode together up the hill, beneath the arching oaks. The servants appeared, the horses
were taken, and Cary and his guest entered the quiet old house. A little later, in the drawing-room,
over a blazing fire and a bottle of wine, Mr. Hunter laid aside a somewhat quaint air of injured
dignity, and condescended to speak of Fontenoy and of how very changed it was since the old
days. "Nothing like so bright, sir, nothing like so bright! I have not thought Miss Dandridge
looking cheerful for more than a year--and she used to be the gayest thing! always smiling,
and with something witty to say every time I came near! I hate changes. This is good wine, Cary."

"Yes. I do not, on the whole, think Fontenoy so changed."

"Don't you? I do. Well, well, it is not the only place that has changed! You've no sign yet,
have you, Cary, of the murderer?"

"He still goes free."

"If there's a man in the county that I dislike," remarked Mr. Hunter, "it is Lewis Rand. But
if he had taken the river road that day as he said he should, he and your brother might have
travelled together, and the two would have been a match for the damned gypsy, or whoever it
was, that shot Mr. Cary. Have you ever noticed what little things make all the difference?
Shall I pour for you, too?"

"As he said he should. How do you know that he said he should?"

"Why, he and I slept the night of the sixth of September at the Cross Roads Inn--"

"Ah!"

"Yes, one gets strange housemates at an inn. Well, after supper I went out on the porch and
began calling to the dogs, and he was there sitting on the steps in the dusk. The wind was
blowing, and there were fireflies, and the dogs were jumping up and down. 'Down, Rover!' said
I, 'Down, Di! Down, Vixen!' And then Rand and I talked a bit, and I said to him, 'The river
road's bad, but it's much the shortest.'"

"What," demanded Cary, in a strained voice,--"what did he answer?"

"He answered, 'I shall take the river road.'"

Mr. Hunter helped himself to wine. "I was tired, and he was tired, and I didn't like him anyway,
and wasn't interested, so I went on calling to the dogs, and we didn't speak again. He and
his negro boy went on at dawn, and he took, after all, the main road. He isn't," finished Mr.
Hunter, "the kind of person you think of as changeable, and it's a thousand pities he didn't
hold to his first idea! Things might have been different."

Cary rose from the table. "Would you swear, Hunter, to what he said?"

"Why, certainly--before all the justices in Virginia. I don't believe," said Mr. Hunter, "that
my parents could have had good memories, for somehow things slip away from me--but when I do
remember, Cary, I remember for all time!" He drank his wine and looked around him. "I haven't
been in this room, I don't believe, for five years! That was before it was all done over like
this. What a lot of Carys you've got hanging on the walls--and just one left to sit and look
at them! You haven't a portrait of your brother?"

"No. Not upon the walls. If you're not fatigued, would you object to riding with me to West
Hill? That's the nearest justice."

"I'm not at all fatigued. But I can't see what you want it taken down for--"

"Perhaps not," answered Cary patiently, "but you'll swear to it, all the same?"

"Why," said Mr Hunter, "I can have no possible objection to seeing my words in black and white.
I'll take another glass, and then I'll ride with you wherever you like."

At sundown Fairfax Cary, returning to Greenwood alone, gave his horse to Eli, and presently
entered the library. It was a dim old room, unrenewed and unimproved, but the two brothers
had loved and frequented it. Now, in the March sunset, with the fire upon the hearth, with
the dogs that had entered with the master, the shadowy corners, and many books, it had an aspect
both rough and gracious. It was a room in which to remember, and it had an air favourable to
resolve.

The last of the Greenwood Carys walked to the western window and stood looking out and up.
He looked from a hill-top, but the summit upon which lay the Cary burying-ground was higher
yet. The flat stones did not show, nor the wild tangle of dark vine, but the trees stood sharp
and black against the vivid sky. Cary stood motionless, a hand on either side of the window
frame. The colour faded from the sky, and there set in the iron grey of twilight. He left the
window, called for candles, and when they had been brought, sat down at the heavy table and
began to draw a map of the country between the ford and Red Fields.

Three days later he rode into Charlottesville and stopped at the office of Mr. Smith, whom
he found at the back of the house, watching from a chair planted in the sunshine the springing
of a line of bulbs. "You see, sir," quoth the agent, "I cultivate my garden! Tulips here, crocus
there, yonder hyacinths. Red Chalice has been up two days, and my white Amazon peeped out of
the earth yesterday. King Midas and Sulphur and Madame Mere are on the way. Well, Mr. Cary,
I tried my level best with that commission of yours, and I failed! The boy is not for sale."

"Ah!" said Cary, and stooped to examine the white Amazon. "I hardly expected, Mr. Smith, that
he would be for sale. At no price, I presume?"

"At no price. He is one of the house servants, and his master is attached to him. I am very
sorry, sir."

His client rose from the contemplation of the springing hyacinth. "Give yourself no uneasiness,
Mr. Smith. I am not disappointed. There are reasons, no doubt, why Mr. Rand declines to part
with him. Let us put it out of mind. What a bright little garden you will have, sir, when tulip,
crocus, and hyacinth are all in bloom!"

He took his leave, and rode homeward through the keen March weather. "I am beginning to remember
quite plainly," he said. "Presently I'll know it like an old refrain--every word, Saladin,
every word, every word, down to the last black one."

CHAPTER XXXVII

THE SIMPLE RIGHT

An important case in a neighbouring county called Lewis Rand from home, and kept him an April
week in the court room or in a small town's untidy tavern. It was his habit, known and deferred
to, never to accept at such times the hospitality sure to be pressed upon him. The prominent
men of his party urged him home with them, but accepted his refusal with a nod of understanding,
and rode on strong in the conviction that a man so absorbed, so given over to watching and
guarding his client's interests, was assuredly a man to be relied upon in any litigation. A
great lawyer was like a great general--headquarters on the field. As for Lewis Rand and the
next election--if he wanted to be Governor of Virginia, men who heard him in the court room
were not the ones to say him nay! To a rational man his genius vindicated his birth. If he
wanted the post, and if it was to the interest of the state, in God's name let him have it--old
Gideon to the contrary!

Rand won the case, and turned Selim's head toward Albemarle. There had been a weary half day
of thanks and protestations, and he was conscious of a dull relief when the last house was
left behind, when the cultivated fields fell away, and the Virginian forest, still so dominant
in the landscape, opened its dark arms and drew him in.

He rode slowly now, with drooping head. Young Isham, some yards behind, almost went to sleep
in his saddle, so dragging was the tread the mare must follow. The dark aisle of the forest
led presently through a gorge where the woods were in effect primeval. Upon the one hand rose
a bank, thick with delicate moss and fern and shaded by birch and ash; on the other the ravine
fell precipitously to hidden water, and was choked by towering pine and hemlock. The air was
heavy, cool, and dank, the sunshine entering sparsely. The place was, however, a haunt of birds,
and now a wood robin answered its mate.

Rand rode more and more slowly. The way was narrow, but here and there, between it and the
bank, appeared grey boulders sunk in all the fairy growth of early spring. He drew rein, bared
his head, and looked about him, then dismounted and spoke to Young Isham, coming up behind.
"I will sit here a little and rest, Young Isham. Take Selim with you around the turn and wait
for me there. I'm tired, tired, tired!"

The negro obeyed, and the master was left alone Beside the road, beneath the mossy bank, lay
a great fallen rock Rand flung himself down upon this, and as he did so, he remembered a river-bank,
a sycamore, and a rock upon which a boy of fourteen had lain and watched, coming over the hill-top,
distinct against the sunset sky, the god from the machine It was such a stone as this, and
it was seventeen years ago "Seventeen years. And a thousand years in Thy sight--"

The past weeks had seen a change in the condition of his brain. He was yet all but sleepless,
and the physical strain had weakened his frame and sharpened his features, but the sheer force
of the man, asserting itself, had put down the first wild inner tumult. Imagination was not
now whipped to giddy heights, it kept a full, dark level. When, at long intervals, he slept,
it was to dream, but not so dreadfully. He had no more visions such as had haunted him in January.
The thought of Cary was with him, full and deep, a clean and bitter agony, but he saw him no
more save with the eye of the mind. He was as rational as a sleepless man with a murder on
his soul might well be, and he suffered as he had hardly suffered before.

With his face buried in his arms he lay very still upon the rock. He lay in shadow, but the
sunlight was on the treetops above him. The wood robin yet uttered its bell-like note, the
moist wind brought down the bank the fragrance of the fringe tree to blend with the deeper
odour of the pine and hemlock. Rand lay without moving, the fingers of one outstretched hand
clenched upon the edges of the rock. "A thousand years in Thy sight--and my day is as a thousand
years. Oh, my God!"

The minutes passed, deep and grave, slow and full, with the sense of afternoon, of solemn and
trackless woods, unbreathed air, silence and high heaven, then the April wind swept up the
gorge and brought the sound of water. Rand sat up, resting his head upon his hands, and stared
down the shadowy steep. There were flowers growing close to him, violets and anemones, and
on a ledge of rock above, the maiden-hair fern. His eyes falling upon them, they brought to
his mind, suddenly and sadly enough, Deb and her flower ladies, all in a ring beneath the cedars--Faith
and Hope and Charity, Ruth and Esther and the Shulamite.

The recollection of that morning was followed by a thought of the night before--of the Fontenoy
drawing-room and of all who had been gathered there. He saw the place again, and he saw every
figure within it--the two Churchills, the two Carys, Unity, Jacqueline. "There is not one,"
he thought, "to whom I've worked no harm. All that I have touched, I have withered."

The wind again rushed up the gorge, a great stir of air that swayed the trees, and filled the
ravine with a sound like the sea. Rand listened dully, staring down the steeps of pine and
hemlock, giant trees that had dwelt there long. A desolation came upon him. The air appeared
to darken and grow cold, the wind passed, and the gorge lay very still. Rand bowed himself
together, and at last, with a dull and heavy throb, his heart spoke. "What shall I do," it
asked, "O God?"

The Absolute within him made answer. "The simple right."

The wind returned, and the trees of the forest shook to the blast. The simple right! Where
was the simple right in so complex a wrong? Step forward, backward, to either side--harm and
misery every way! And pride, and ambition, and love, and human company--to close the door,
to close the door on all! "No," said Rand, and set his teeth. "No, no!"

The afternoon deepened in the gorge of the Blue Ridge. Now the wind swept it and now the wind
was still. The sunlight touched the treetops, or fell through in shafts upon the early flowers.
From the mould of a million generations stalk and leaf arose for their brief hour of light
and life. When it was spent, they would rest for aeon, then stir again. In the silence was
heard the fall of the pine cone.

Rand lay, face down, upon the rock. In his mind there was now no thought of Cary, no thought
of Jacqueline, nor of Fairfax Cary, nor of any other of the dead and living. It was the valley
of the shadow of death, and his soul was at grips with Apollyon.

He lay there until all the sunlight was withdrawn from the gorge, and until Young Isham, frightened
into disobedience, came and touched him upon the shoulder. He lifted a grey and twisted face.
"Yes, yes, Young Isham, it is late! Go back, and I will come in a moment."

The negro went, and Rand arose from the rock, crossed the road, and stood looking down toward
the hidden water. From somewhere out of the green gloom sounded the bird's throbbing note,
then all again was quiet, dank, and still. He raised his arms, resting them and his face upon
them against the red bark of a giant pine. The thought of death in the pool below came to him,
but he shook his head. The door was open, truly, but it led nowhere. His soul looked at the
chasm it must cross, shuddered, and crossed it. His arms dropped from the tree and he raised
his eyes to the blue above. He was yet in a land of effort and anguish, but the god within
him saw the light.

CHAPTER XXXVIII

M. DE PINCORNET

Malplaquet was a Cary place, leagued in friendship as in blood with Greenwood. For seven months
it had esteemed itself in mourning for the kinsman who had ridden from its gates to a violent
death. But there were young girls in the house, and now, in the bright May weather, it was
hard not to put forth leaf and bud and be gay once more. Actual gayety would not do, the place
felt that, and very heartily; but pleasure that was also education, pleasure well within bounds,
and education insisted upon, this might now be temperately indulged in. There seemed no good
reason why, in mid-spring, the dancing class should not be held at Malplaquet, since it was
the most convenient house to a large neighbourhood, and there were in the family three young girls.

The age esteemed dancing a highly necessary accomplishment, and its acquisition meant work,
and hard work, no less than delightful play. Half a dozen young people came to stay three days
at the house; half a score more drove or rode over in the afternoons, going home after ten
by moonlight or by starlight Their elders came with them, it was a business of minuets and
contra-dances, painstakingly performed and solicitously watched A large old parlour gave its
waxed floor, Mr Pincornet's violin furnished the music, and Mr Pincornet himself, lately returned
to Albemarle from his season in Richmond, imparted instruction and directed the dance. The
house was full from garret to cellar, neighbours' horses in the stables, neighbours' servants
in the quarter. The long, low brick office standing under the big oaks in the yard made, according
to custom, a barracks for the young men who, high of mettle, bold, and gay, rode in from twenty
miles around, ready to dance from dusk till dawn, and then, in a bright garden and May weather,
to pursue some bits of muslin throughout a morning. Malplaquet was in a state of sober glee
when, inconveniently enough, the one Cary whose mourning had not lightened chanced, in ignorance
of the dancing class, to ride through the gates and up the hill.

It was his intention, it appeared, to spend the night which was fast falling, and to ride back
to Charlottesville in the morning. The head of the Malplaquet Carys met him with affection
and apology. "Young people will be young, Fair, and Molly and I thought it best to humour them
in this no great thing! It's a mere lesson they're having. But I'm sorry, cousin--"

"You need not be, sir," said the other. "Ludwell would have been the last man on earth to wish
their spirit less, or their pleasure less. It's time and the weather, sir,--Malplaquet feels
it with all the world. You must not be troubled, and you must not disturb my cousins. I might
ride on--"

"No, no, Fair! No, no!"

"Then I won't. Give me a room in the office--I see the house is full--and let Remus bring me
supper there. If you'll come over later, sir, we'll talk Embargo, and I'll give you the up-county
news. I'll to bed early, I think."

"I wish I could come! By George, it would be a relief to get away from all the bowing and scraping!
You're sure you aren't hurt, Fair?"

"Quite sure," answered the other, with his old smile. "I'll go now to the office, if I may.
No need even to tell them I am here."

Not to tell them was a thing more easily said than done. Time was when Fairfax Cary would have
been hailed delightedly, drawn at once to the centre of things, and kept there by the quick
glances of young women, the emulative gaze of neighbourhood gallants, and the approving consideration
of the elder folk. His presence was wont to make itself felt. Now, when the news spread that
he was at Malplaquet, there was a break in the dance, a pause, a hush. "What shall we do?"
asked in distress the daughters of the house.

"Go on dancing," was the reply. "He'll have no difference made. But when the lesson's over,
you'll remember, one and all, that he is here."

In the far room of the office, quiet, and with a porch of its own, Cary got rid of the dust
of the road, then ate the supper, bountiful and delicate, brought by Remus and presided over
by the mistress of the house, who talked to him of Greenwood and of his father. "The best dancer,
Fair, and, after Henry Churchill, the handsomest man,--with the air, you know, and always brave
and gay and true as steel! They said he was a good hater, and I know he was a good friend.
You take after him, Fair."

"Ludwell did."

"Yes, I know, I know--but you the most. Ludwell had much from your mother--that strength and
patience and grace were Lucy Meade's. Well, well, I cry when I think of it, so I'll not think!
Is there nothing more you'll have? Remus is to wait upon you--you hear, Remus? And now, Fair,
I'll go back to the children"

Cary kissed her. "Give them all three my love, and tell little Anne to mind her steps. I've
got a book to read, and I'll go to bed early."

He sat over his book until nearly ten, then extinguished his candles and stepped out upon the
small, moonlit porch. From the house, a hundred yards away, came the sound of the violin, and
of laughter, subdued but genuine. Cary drew a chair to the porch railing and sat down, resting
his elbow upon the wood, his cheek upon his hand. The violin brought the thought of Unity.
The laughter did not grate upon him. His nature was large, and the mirth at Malplaquet did
no unkindness as it meant none. He sat there quietly until the music stopped and the lesson
came to an end. The pupils not staying overnight went away, as testified the sound of wheel
and stamp of hoof, the laughing voices and lingering good-byes, audible from the front of the
house. This noise died, then, after an interval, lights appeared in upper windows. Slender
arms and hands, put far out, drew to the wooden shutters; clear, girlish voices said good-night,
and were answered by fervent and deeper tones below.

The quiet proper to the hour drew on, the lighted windows darkened one by one, and presently
there appeared at the office the master of the house, accompanied by two or three young men.
These greeted Cary soberly, but with much kindness. "We've put," said the host, "all the talkative
rattlepates away in the house, and given you three sensible men! Mr. Bland has the room at
the other end, Jack Minor and Nelson the one next to him, and in the little room beside yours,
Fair, we'll stow Mr. Pincornet. They've all danced themselves tired, and the whole place is
to have a quiet night." The three sensible men went, after a little, to their several quarters,
and the kinsman continued: "The class ends to-night, Fair. To-morrow morning all go away except
the Blands and the Morrises and George Harvie's little Dorothea. The house will be quiet, and
you are not to ride away from us in the morning! Good-night--God bless you!"

Cary, left alone, watched the lights go out in the rooms of Mr. Bland, Mr. Minor, and Mr. Nelson.
He thought, "I will go to bed and go to sleep"; then, so bright was the moonlight, so sweet
and fragrant and now silent the night, that he stayed on upon the little porch, his arms against
the railing, his eyes now on the moon, now on the quiet great house and the shadowy clumps
of trees. Presently Mr. Pincornet, the moon whitening his old brocade and his curled wig, came
from the house, crossed the grass, and mounted to the porch upon which his small room opened.

He started as he saw the figure by the railing. "Who is it?" he demanded, in his high, cracked
voice; then, "Ah, I see, I see! A thousand pardons, Mr. Cary,--"

"We are to be neighbours to-night," said Cary. "It has been long since we met, Mr. Pincornet.
I am glad to see you again."

"I have been in Richmond," said the dancing master, "since--since September."

Cary touched a chair near him with a gesture of invitation. "Won't you sit down? It is too
beautiful a night to go early to bed, and I do not think we will disturb the others' slumbers.
But perhaps you are tired--"

"The practice of my art does not tire me," answered Mr. Pincornet. "I will watch the moon with
you for as long as you please. We had nights such as this near Aire, when I was young"

He sat down, leaning his chin upon his beruffled hand. The light falling full on his companion
showed the dark dress and above it the quiet, much altered face. Mr. Pincornet sighed, and
tapped nervously upon the railing with the fingers of his other hand. "Mr Cary, I have not
seen you since--Pray accept my profound condolences, my sympathy, and my admiration."

His old pupil thanked him. "All my brother's friends and mine are most kind. I should guess
that you have yourself seen many sorrows, Mr. Pincornet."

The Frenchman's face twitched. "Many, sir, many. I have experienced the curse of fortune. Eh
bien! one pays, and all is said! I have grieved with you, sir, I beg you to believe it. I admired
your brother."

"He was worthy of admiration."

"In the south, near Mauléon, I lost such an one--brother not in blood but in friendship, a
friendship pure as the flowers of spring and strong as the vintage of autumn. His own troops
turned Jacobin and scoundrel, mutinied, shot him down--Ha!" Mr. Pincornet drew out his box
and took snuff with trembling fingers. "Well! the King's side was uppermost for a while down
there, and we had our revenge--we had our revenge--we had our revenge! But," he ended sadly,
"it could not bring back my poor Charles."

"Did you think of it as revenge?"

"No. I thought of it as justice. It was that, sir. Those soldiers paid, but they owed the debt--every
sou they owed it! He was," continued Mr. Pincornet, "gallant and brave, a great lover, a great
fighter. He was to my heart, though not of my blood--"

"The man that I have lost," said Cary, "was of my blood and to my heart. I am left alone of
an old house. And I pursue justice, Mr. Pincornet, I pursue justice, I pursue justice."

Mr. Pincornet looked at the face opposite him. "I think, sir, you will capture that to which
you give chase. I have been in town, away from the country, but I hear the talk, and sometimes
I read the papers. You have not taken the murderer?"

"No!"

"It is strange!" exclaimed the other. "And no one suspected?"

"I suspect," answered Cary sternly, "but the world in general does not, or suspects wrongly.
You were not at the inquest which was held?"

The dancing master shook his head. "In your sorrow, sir, such matters were, naturally, not
brought to your notice. I fell ill, in the first days of September, at Red Fields, of a cold
upon the lungs. I gave up my art and lay at death's door. My head was light; I heard and I
thought of nothing but the faces and the voices around about Aire where I was young. I recovered,
and, in the stage, I went to Richmond. To ask who is it you suspect would be a question indiscreet--"

Cary sat with his eyes upon the dark azure above the treetops. "Not yet," he said, in a brooding
voice; "I have him not yet. Did you, Mr. Pincornet, have any scruple when you took vengeance,
near Mauléon?"

"None, sir! I served justice. Soldiers are not levied to murder at once their faith and their
officers. No more scruple than is yours in hunting down the wild beast that killed your brother!
You have my wishes there for a good hunting!"

The Ancien Régime put up his snuffbox and brushed the fallen grains from his old, old red brocade.
"What a night for music and for love! The road down yonder--it is like the silver ribbon they
wear--they wore--at court!"

"The road--the road!" exclaimed Cary. "I travel it in my sleep. It haunts me as I haunt it.
I know all its long stretches, all its turns--" He sighed, and moved so as to face the whitened
ribbon.

"You ride," said the dancing master; "but, for my own convenience, I go afoot, and it is probable
that I know it best."

They sat gazing down past garden and hillside to the still highway. "I have not walked upon
it, however," continued Mr. Pincornet reflectively, "since September. I then went afoot from
Clover Hill to Red Fields, where I was taken ill. It was the seventh of September."

"The seventh of September!"

"I remember the day," continued Mr. Pincornet, "because I sat down under a tree beside the
road to rest, and I had an almanac in my pocket."

"You remember it by nothing else?"

"Why, by one thing more," answered the other. "I sat there, my head on my hand, perhaps thinking
of nothing, perhaps thinking of France--an empty road and in the sky black clouds--when suddenly--what
do you say?--clatter, crash! through the wood opposite and down a tall red bank to the road
came another pupil of mine--"

"Yes?" said Cary. "Who?"

"Mr. Lewis Rand."

Something fell to the floor with a slight sound. It was the book that had rested upon Cary's
crossed knee. He stooped and picked it up, then, straightening himself, looked again at the
silver ribbon. "Black clouds in the sky," he said, in a curious voice, "and the seventh of
September, M. de Pincornet?"

"Yes," replied the other, "by the almanac. That was two days, was it not, before your brother's
death?"

"My brother, sir, was murdered upon the seventh of September."

"The seventh! The ninth! You mean the ninth! I heard it so when I recovered--"

"You heard it wrongly. It was the seventh."

There was a silence; then, "Indeed," said the dancing master, in a curious dry and shocked
voice. "The seventh. At what hour?"

"It is not known. Perhaps about midday, perhaps a little later--when there were black clouds
in the sky."

The silence fell again, hard and full of meaning, then Cary leaned forward and laid his hand
upon the other's arm "I've hunted long alone, now we'll hunt for a moment together! Tell me again."

"He came down the bank in a great noise and rolling of stone and earth. There were thick woods
on the top of the bank. He came out of them like Pluto out of the earth--"

"He was alone?"

"Alone. But he had a negro waiting for him down the road."

"He told you that?"

"I left my tree and we talked a little. He was torn, he was breathless. He explained that he
had started a doe and had followed through the woods. He left me and went down the road to
meet his negro. They passed me, and when I came to Red Fields, I was told they had paused there.
I said nothing of our meeting. I was very tired and the storm was breaking. Before it was over
I was hot and cold and shaking and ill in my bed. I was ill, as I have told you, for a long
time. The ninth! I always thought it was the ninth--"

"Would you know again the place where this chase occurred?"

"He came down the bank opposite the blasted oak."

"Ah!" breathed Cary; then, after a moment, "I stopped my horse beneath that tree this morning,
and my eyes rested upon that red bank. And I did not know! We are very blind." He rose. "Will
you come indoors, sir? I wish to light the candles again."

They entered the small bedroom. Cary lighted the candles, placed them upon the table, and closed
the shutters of the one window. From the breast of his riding-coat he took a rolled paper.
"This is a map of the country below Red Fields. I made it myself. Now let us see, sir, let us see!"

He pinned the map down with ink-well, sand-box, book, and candlestick, which done, the two
bent over it. "Call it," said Cary, "a military map of your country near Mauléon. Now, sir,
look! Here is what a man did."

The demonstration proceeded, and it was carried out with keenness and with a very fair approach
to accuracy. "Here is Malplaquet, which one passes about nine in the morning, and there by
the candlestick is Red Fields, certainly on the main road and certainly paused at by"--he glanced
aside at the other's face--"by the murderer, M. de Pincornet! Now let us mark this fox that
doubles on himself."

The long, curled wig of the Frenchman and the younger man's handsome head with the hair gathered
back into a black ribbon bent lower over the map. "Forrest's forge, the mill, the ford, he
passed these places under such and such circumstances--here, where I rest the pen, stands the
guide-post. This line is your silvered ribbon, this is the main road that makes a sweep around
the broken country. This heavy, black, and jagged line is the river road. They both took the
river road, as both had said they would--my brother to me, the murderer to a man at the Cross
Roads Inn. The negro boy kept on by the main road. Where is this riven oak?" He dipped the
quill into the ink-well. "I correct my map according to my better knowledge. That tree stands
two miles below Red Fields, just above the turn where, fifty years ago, was the Indian ambush.
We'll mark it here, black and charred. Here is the bank, crowned by woods. The growth is very
thick between it and"--his hand, holding the pen, travelled across the sheet--"the river road
just east of Indian Run."

He laid down the pen, and turned from the table to the open door. "The moon is not bright enough,
or I would go to-night. I want sunlight, or I want storm-light, for that ride across from road
to road! Five hours till morning." He returned to the dancing master. "When, in your country,
the man you loved was to be avenged, and his murderers punished, you were glad of aid, were
you not? I shall be thankful for every least thing that you can tell me."

"He came," said the émigré, "like Pluto out of the earth. He was breathless as one out of prison--his
linen was torn. There was," the narrator's voice halted, then hardened in tone,--"there was
blood upon his sleeve. At the time I supposed that, in bursting through that grille of the
forest, branch or briar had drawn it. There was blood, sir, about your brother?"

"Yes. If the murderer stooped to know if life was out, it might have happened so."

"He was not pale, I think, but he spoke in a strange voice. 'Ha!' he said, 'I started a doe
ten minutes since, and gave her chase through the wood. Now I will rejoin my boy a little way
down the road. Are you on your way to Charlottesville?' I told him I would go to Red Fields,
upon which he said adieu and turned his horse. A little later he and his boy passed me, riding
in a cloud of dust and under black skies." The dancing master raised a glass of water that
was upon the table and moistened his lips. "This, Mr. Cary, is all my aid. I admired your brother,
and there is, sir, a something about you that returns Charles to my memory. If it pleases you,
and if our host will lend me a horse, I will ride with you in the morning, as far at least
as the oak and that red bank down which he came."

"I accept your offer, sir," answered the other, "with gratitude. You did not chance to notice
his holsters?"

"No--except that his saddle had holsters. I have seen his pistols. I saw them one night at
Monticello. He told me that they were a gift from his patron."

"Yes. They were given by Mr. Jefferson, and the other's name is upon them. Moreover, he travelled
armed from Richmond to Roselands. I acquired that knowledge in the autumn. I would that iron
could speak--if it could, and if human effort be of avail, I would yet have those pistols in
my holding!"

He took the map from the table, rolled it up, and restored it to its place. "It grows late,"
he said. "Let us to bed and to sleep. It is the eve of a decisive engagement, M. de Pincornet.
If you'll permit me, I will call you at five. Remus shall make us coffee, and we'll make free
with a horse for you from the stables. Then the road again! but this time I go no farther than
the ford, on that white ribbon yonder. You shall keep the highroad, but I will take the river
road, and yet I'll hold tryst with you beneath that riven oak!" He began to put out the candles.
"I shall sleep and sleep well until dawn, and I wish for you, sir, as good a night. For the
aid which you have given me, I am most heartily your servant."

Alone in the little room, he straightened, mechanically, the objects upon the table, paced
for a time or two the narrow, cell-like place, then went out again upon the porch and stood
with his hands on the railing, and his eyes raised to the white moon, full and serene in the
cloudless night. "For without," he said, "are dogs and sorcerers and murderers and whosoever
loveth and maketh a lie." He stood for a long while without movement, but at last let fall
his hands, turned, and went indoors. When, a little later, he threw himself upon his bed and
drew his hand across his eyes, he found that it was wet with tears. He spoke aloud, though
hardly above his breath. "No, Ludwell, no! In this sole thing I am right. It is not revenge.
I am not vindictive, I am not revengeful. This is justice, and I can no other than pursue it.
It will not grieve you where you are." He turned and buried his face in the pillow. "O brother--O
friend--"

The emotion passed and he lay staring at the ceiling, reconstructing midday of September the
seventh beside Indian Run.

CHAPTER XXXIX

UNITY AND JACQUELINE

The library at Fontenoy lay west and north. In the afternoon the sun struck through the windows
and through the glass door, brightening the tall clock-face, the faint gilt and brown of old
books, and the portrait of Henry Churchill with the swords crossed beneath. Upon the forenoon
in question, and even though the month was May, the room looked a sombre place, chill and dusk,
shaded and grave as a hermit's cell.

In the great chair upon the hearth sat Colonel Churchill, somewhat bowed together and with
his hand over his eyes. By the window stood Major Edward, very upright, very meagre, soldierly,
and grey. The northern light was upon him; with his pinned-up sleeve and lifted head he looked
a figure of old defeats and indomitable mind. From the middle of the room Fairfax Cary faced
both the Churchills.

In his dark riding-dress, standing with his gloved hand upon the table, he gave in look and
attitude a suggestion of formality, a subtle conveyance of determination. He had been speaking,
and now, after an interruption from one of the brothers, he continued. "That was two weeks
ago. I have it clear, and I have my witness. The murderer, leaving the body of my brother beside
Indian Run, turned his horse, and, at a point just east of the rock where grows the mountain
ash, he quitted the road for the mountain-side. It is desperate riding over that ridge, but
he made it as, two weeks ago, I made it, and he came out, as I came out, upon the high bank
above the main road, a few yards below the blasted oak. That, Colonel Churchill, is what he
did, and what a jury shall see that he did."

Colonel Dick let fall his hand. "Fair, Fair, I never gainsaid that he was a villain--"

"He appeared," continued the younger man, "before my witness, torn and breathless. There was
blood upon his sleeve. Now see what he does. He rejoins his negro, and, if I know my man, he
intimidates this boy into silence like the grave. Together they pause at Red Fields, a precaution
that quite naturally suggests itself to the lawyer mind. But it is in the gloom of the storm,
and he does not dismount--a course which, again, he knows to be wise. Apparently Red Fields
notices nothing. He rides on. But he has yet to pass through town, to be accosted here, there,
at the Eagle, the post-office, to be forced, perhaps, under peril of his refusal being scanned,
to get down from his horse, answer questions, drink and talk with acquaintances. He is torn,
dishevelled. There is blood upon his sleeve. What does he think as he rides from Red Fields?
He thinks, 'Where can I best put myself in order, and remove this witness?' That would be his
thought, and he would have the answer ready. He rode on to the edge of town, and there he stopped
at Tom Mocket's."

Major Edward left the window. As he passed his brother, he laid for a moment his hand upon
the elder's shoulder. The touch was protective, almost tender. "It's a rough wind, Dick! Bow
your head and let it go over." He marched away, dragged a chair to the table, and sat down.
"Very well," he said. "He stopped at Tom Mocket's."

"Yes, but not merely at the gate, as he testified. He went into the house, and there he washed
the blood-stain from his sleeve."

"Can you prove that?"

"I can prove that he went into the house. A negro, running from the storm, saw him enter. When
that girl--Vinie Mocket--is put upon the stand, I expect to prove the remainder. Now, the pistol--"

Colonel Dick rose, walked heavily to the glass door, then back to the hearth. "You stand there,
as I have seen your father stand. Well, go on! We are men, Edward and I."

"His pistols are handsome ones, the gift of Mr. Jefferson. The murderer's name is engraved
upon them. He has made, since September, a number of journeys, and he travels always with holsters
to his saddle. Well, not long ago, I bribed the hostler of a tavern where I knew he was to
sleep. I have seen the arms he carries. Two holsters, two pistols--but the latter do not match!
A different maker, a heavier weight, and the owner's name but indifferently etched. And yet
there is in Richmond a man who will swear to Mr. Rand's leaving town with the President's gift
intact! The inference is, I think, that somewhere between Indian Run and Roselands the weapon
vanished--how and when and where I have yet to find. I expect to recover it, and in the mean
time I expect to force an explanation of those mismatched pistols."

He had been standing without motion--manner, voice, and attitude restrained and somewhat formal.
He now moved, took his hand from the table, and folded his arms. "I came," he said, "to tell
you, Colonel Churchill, and you, Major Edward, you who were my brother's friends and my father's
friends, I came to tell you that I shall apply for and obtain a warrant for the arrest of Lewis
Rand."

The words fell heavily, and when they were spoken, there was a silence in the library. Major
Edward broke it. "You are determined, and I waste no breath in challenging the inevitable.
So be it! The child will come home to us, Dick."

The elder brother walked the length of the room and paused before the picture of Henry Churchill.
When at last he turned, his ruddy face was pale, his eyes wet. "Henry was a proud man. We grow
old, and we grow to be thankful that the dead are dead! Well, Edward, well! we've weathered
much--I reckon we can weather more." He halted at the glass door and stared out into the flowering
garden. "My little Jack!" he muttered, and drew his hand across his eyes.

Cary spoke from where he yet stood beside the table. "I am aware--how can I be other than aware?--of
the sorrow and anxiety which I bring upon this house. As regards myself, you have but to indicate
your wishes, sir. I will come no more to Fontenoy, if my coming is unwelcome. One interest
here I confidently entrust to your generosity. For the rest I will bow to your decision. If
you tell me so, sir, I will come no more--though Fontenoy is well nigh as dear to me as Greenwood,
and though I love and honour every inmate here."

His voice broke a little. There was a silence, then Colonel Dick swung around from the glass
door. "Don't talk damned nonsense, Fair," he said gruffly.

Major Edward spoke from the old green chair. "We'll bring no unnecessary factors into this
business, Fairfax. I don't conceive that it is necessary for us to quarrel. +BAROQUE CHURCHES.+
The Baroque style prevailed in church architecture for almost two
centuries.

The majority of the churches present varieties of the cruciform plan
crowned by a high dome which is usually the best part of the design.

Everywhere else the vices of the period appear in these churches, especially in their façades
and internal decoration.

+S. M. della Vittoria+, by Maderna, and +Sta. Agnese+, by Borromini, both at Rome, are examples
of the style. Naples is particularly full of Baroque churches (Fig. 173), a few of which, like
the +Gesù Nuovo+ (1584), are dignified and creditable designs.

The domical church of +S. M. della Salute+, at Venice (1631), by Longhena, is also a majestic
edifice in excellent style (Fig. 174), and here and there other churches offer exceptions to the
prevalent baseness of architecture. Particularly objectionable was the wholesale disfigurement
of existing monuments by ruthless remodelling, as in S. John Lateran, at Rome, the cathedrals
of Ferrara and Ravenna, and many others.

+PALACES.+ These were generally superior to the churches, and not infrequently impressive and
dignified structures. The two best examples in Rome are the +P. Borghese+, by Martino Lunghi
the Elder (1590), with a fine court arcade on coupled Doric and Ionic columns, and the +P. Barberini+,
by Maderna and Borromini, with an elliptical staircase by Bernini, one of the few palaces
in Italy with projecting lateral wings. And I can see it as no other than right that I--when
all her paid soldiers failed--should have taken it on myself to bring him there, before her
bar. It is this which I shall do, and the end is not with me, but with right and law and order,
with the weal of society, yes, and with the man's own proper reaping of the harvest which he
sowed! Else he also is monstrous, and there is nothing not awry." He paused, made a slight
and dignified gesture with his hands, and went on. "I have done that which I had to do. I abide
the consequences. But it is hard to bring trouble on you here, and to bring great trouble on--on
one other. I wish you to know that, though I go my way, I go with a pained and heavy heart."

He broke off, and stood with his eyes upon the younger of the two brothers; then, after a moment
and with a note of appeal in his voice, "Major Edward--"

Major Edward raised his hawk eyes and resolute face. "Trouble enough, yes, heavy trouble--but
I should have done as you have done! It is all in the great battle, Fair. We'll be friends
still, Fontenoy and Greenwood. There is Unity at the door."

       *       *       *       *       *

From the Fontenoy coach Unity, who had not been to Roselands since December, regarded the quiet
old place through a sudden mist of tears. The driveway from the gate was sunk in green; a hundred
trees kept the place secluded, sylvan, and still. Hardly any bloom appeared,--the flowers were
all in the quiet garden hidden by the house,--but through a small open space could be seen
the giant beech tree by the doorstone.

Unity dried her eyes with her handkerchief, and bit her lips until they were red again. "If
you're nothing but a bird of omen," she said to herself, "at least you needn't show it! Oh,
this world!" then, "What if he is not from home?"

In the early winter she had advanced several pretexts for not troubling Roselands, had found
them accepted by Jacqueline with an utter lack of comment, and had ceased to make them. She
kept away, and her cousin made no complaint. What pretext, now, she wondered, would serve to
explain this visit? She thought that pretext would be needed at first--just at first. And what
if Lewis Rand were at home?

He was not at home. Jacqueline met her upon the great doorstone, kissed her, and held her hand,
but made no exclamation of surprise and asked no questions. The coach and four, with old Philip
and Mingo, rolled away to the stable, and the cousins entered the cool, wide hall. "You will
lay aside your bonnet?" said Jacqueline. "Such a lovely bonnet, Unity!--and your blue lutestring!
Come to my room."

In the chamber Unity untied her blue bonnet-strings and laid the huge scoop of straw upon the
white counterpane; then, at the mirror, slowly drew off her long gloves, and took from her
silken bag her small handkerchief. The action of her hands, now deliberate, now hurried, was
strange for Unity, whose habit it was to be light and sure. "Do you remember," she asked, with
her face still to the mirror,--"do you remember the last time I wore this gown?"

"You wore it," said Jacqueline, in a trembling voice, "to church, in August--to Saint John's."

"Yes. That Sunday when all the world was there. I smell the honeysuckle again, and hear FitzWhyllson's
viol! That was our last old, happy day together."

"Was it?"

"Yes, it was. The very next day the world seemed somehow to change."

"Isn't that a way the world has?" asked Jacqueline. "Change and change and change again--"

"Yes," answered Unity, "but never to the same, never to the same again--"

A silence fell in the room that was all flowered chintz. Unity, raising her eyes to the glass,
saw within it her cousin where she leaned against a chair--saw the face, the eyes, the lips--saw
the mask off. Unity gasped, wheeled, ran to the chair, and, falling on her knees beside it,
clasped her cousin in her arms. "O Jacqueline! O Jacqueline, Jacqueline!"

Jacqueline rested her hands upon the other's shoulders. "Why did you come to-day, Unity? The
last time was December."

"I came--I came"--sobbed Unity, "just to bring you their love--Uncle Dick's and Uncle Edward's
and Aunt Nancy's--and to say that Fontenoy is still home, and--and--"

"Yes," said Jacqueline. "But this is my home now, Unity. It has been"--she raised her arms--"it
has been my home for many and many a day! You may tell them that; you may tell it to Fairfax Cary."

"Don't--don't think of him as an enemy!"

"I think of him as he is. What is the message, Unity?"

"I have none--I have none," cried Unity, "except that whatever happens--whatever happens, Jacqueline,
you are the darling of us all--of the old home and Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward and Aunt Nancy
and Deb and me and all the servants! There is none at Fontenoy that does not love and honour
you! Think of us, and come to us--"

"When? When, Unity?"

Unity rose. "Now, if you will, darling--dearest--"

Jacqueline smiled. "Now? When you are married, you will find that you cannot leave home so
easily." She crossed the bedroom floor to a window, and stood with her hands on either side
of the casement, and with her face lifted to the pure blue heaven.

Unity waited with held breath. "She knows--she knows," said her beating heart.

Jacqueline came back to the middle of the room. "Thank them for me, Unity, and tell them that
I cannot leave my husband now." Her touch, clay-cold and fluttering, fell upon her cousin's
arm. "There are wisdom and goodness in the world, and they wish to see things rightly, if only
they had the power. Tell them at Fontenoy, and tell Fairfax Cary, too, that they have not altogether
understood! Even he--even the one who is dead--did not quite do that, though he came more nearly
than any. It is my hope and my belief that now he understands, forgives, and sees--and sees
the dawn in the land!"

She raised her head, and the expression of her face was exquisite. No longer wan, she stood
as though the flush of dawn were upon her. It paled, and the air of tragedy enfolded her again,
but the light had been there, and it left her majestic. The grace within her and the sweetness
were unfailing. She came now to her cousin, put an arm around her, and kissed her on the cheek.
"You love truly, too," she whispered. "When trouble comes, you'll understand--you'll understand!"

Unity held her to her and wept. "O Jacqueline!--O Jacqueline!"

"You put on the blue gown to remind me, didn't you?" asked Jacqueline. "I didn't need any reminding,
dear. It is all with me, all the old, frank, happy days; all the time when I was a girl and
we used to sit, just you and I, by my window and watch the stars come out between the fir branches!
And I love you all, every one of you. And I do not blame Fairfax Cary. It is destiny, I think,
with us all. But I want you to know--and you can tell them that, too,--that there is one whom
I love beyond every one else, beyond life, death, fear, anguish, meeting, and parting. Loving
him so, and not despairing of a life to come when we are all washed clean, my dear, when we
are all washed clean--"

Her voice broke and she moved again to the window. The clock ticked, the sun came dazzling
in, a fly buzzed against the pane. Jacqueline turned. "Tell them that they are all dear to
me, but that my home is here with my husband. Tell them that Lewis Rand--that Lewis Rand"--She
put her hands to her breast. "No. I have not power to tell you that--not yet, not yet! But
this I say--my uncles were soldiers, and they fought bravely and witnessed much, but I have
seen a battlefield"--She shuddered strongly and brought her hands together as if to wring them,
then let them fall instead and turned upon her cousin a face colourless but almost smiling.
"It is strange," she said, "what pain we grow to call Victory. Let's talk of it no more, Unity."
She caressed the other's hand, raised it to her lips, and kissed it.

"I did not come to stay," said Unity brokenly. "You had rather be alone. The evening is falling
and they look for me at home. When you call me, I will come again. Are you sure--are you sure,
Jacqueline, that you understand what they--what they sent me to say?"

"I understand enough," said Jacqueline, in a very low voice, and kissed her cousin upon the brow.

CHAPTER XL

THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR

Rand closed the heavy ledger. "It is all straight," he said.

"It's as straight as if 'twas a winding-up forever," answered Tom. "Are you going home now?"

"Yes."

"There's almost nothing on the docket. I've seen no such general clearance since you began
to practise and took me in. You say you're going to refuse the Amherst case?"

"I have refused it."

"Then," quoth Tom, "I might as well go fishing. The weather's right, and every affair of yours
is so cleaned and oiled and put to rights that there's nothing here for a man to do. One might
suppose you were going a long journey. If you don't want me to-morrow, I'll call on old Mat
Green--"

"Don't go fishing to-morrow, Tom," said Rand from the desk, "but don't come here either. Stay
at home with Vinie."

"You won't be coming in from Roselands?"

"I won't be coming here." Rand left the desk and stood at the small window where the roses
were now in bloom. "I shall send you a note, Tom, to-morrow morning. It will tell you what"--He
paused for a moment. "What comes next," he finished. "There will be a message in it for Vinie."
He turned from the window. "I am going home now." 

The orders of King Philip to the Duke de Medina Sidonia were, that he should, on entering the
Channel, keep near the French coast, and, if attacked by the English
ships, avoid an action, and steer on to Calais roads, where the Prince
of Parma's squadron was to join him.

The hope of surprising and destroying the English fleet in Plymouth,
led the Spanish admiral to deviate from these orders, and to stand
across to the English shore; but, on finding that Lord Howard was
coming out to meet him, he resumed the original plan, and determined
to bend his way steadily towards Calais and Dunkirk, and to keep merely
on the defensive against such squadrons of the English as might come
up with him.

 He rode slowly, with his eyes upon a great sea of vivid gold. By degrees the
brightness faded, changing to an amethyst, out of which suddenly swam the evening star. The
land rose into hills, the summits of the highest far and dark against the cold violet of the
sky. From the road to Roselands branched the road to Greenwood. It was dusk when horse and
rider reached this opening. Selim had come to know the altered grasp upon the rein just here,
and now, according to wont, he fell into the slower pace. Rand turned in his saddle and looked
across the darkening fields to the low hill, crowned with oaks, from which arose the Greenwood
house. He gazed for a full minute, then spoke to his horse and they went on at speed. A little
longer and he was at the gates of home.

His wife met him upon the doorstone. "I heard you at the gate--"

He put his arm around her. "What have you been doing all the long day?"

"I worked," she answered, "and saw to the house, and read to Hagar at the quarter. She's going
fast. How tired your voice sounds! Come into the light. Supper is ready--and Mammy Chloe has
said a charm to make you sleep to-night."

They went indoors to the lighted rooms. "You are wearing your amethysts," said Rand, "and the
ribbon in your hair--"

She turned upon him a face exquisite in expression. "They are the jewels that you like--the
ribbon as I wore it long ago. Come in--come in to supper."

The brief meal ended, they returned to the drawing-room. Rand stood irresolutely. "I have yet
a line to write," he told her. "I will do it here at your desk. When I have finished, Jacqueline,
then there is something I must say."

He sat down and began to write. She moved to the window, then restlessly back to the lighted
room and sat down before the hearth, but in a moment she left this, too, and moved again through
the room. She passed her harp, and as she did so, she drew her hand across the strings. The
sweet and liquid sound ran through the room. Rand turned. "I have not heard," he said, in a
low voice,--"I have not heard that sound since--since last August. Will you sing to me now?"

She touched the harp again. "Yes, Lewis. What shall I sing?"

He rose, walked to the window, and stood with his face to the night. "Sing those verses you
sang that night at Fontenoy"; then, as she struck a chord, "No, not To Althea--the other."

She sang. The noble contralto, pure, rich, and deep, swelled through the room.

     "The thirst that from the soul doth rise
        Doth ask a drink divine"--

Her voice broke and her hands dropped from the strings. She rose quickly and left the harp.
"I cannot--I cannot sing to-night. The air is faint--the flowers are too heavy. Come out--come
out to the wind and the stars!"

Without the house the evening wind blew cool, moving the long branches of the beech tree, and
rustling through the grass. To the west the mountains showed faintly, in the valley a pale
streak marked the river. The sky was thick with stars. Behind them, through the open door,
they heard the tall clock strike. "I did not tell you," said Jacqueline, "of all my day. Unity
was here this afternoon."

"Unity!"

"Yes. For an hour. She came with--with messages. My uncles send me word that they love me,
and that Fontenoy is my home always--as it used to be. Whenever I wish, I am to come home."

"What did you answer?"

"I answered that they were all dear to me, but that my home was here with you. I told Unity
to tell them that--and to tell it, too, to Fairfax Cary."

There was a silence; then, "It does not matter," said Rand slowly. "Whether it is done my way,
or whether it is done his way, Fairfax Cary will not care. He is concerned only that it shall
be done. You understood the message, Jacqueline?"

She answered almost inaudibly. "Yes, I understood."

"Seven months--and Ludwell Cary lies unavenged. I have been slow. But I had to break a strong
chain, Jacqueline. I had fastened it, link by link, around my soul. It was not easy to break--it
was not easy! And I had to find a path in a desert place."

She bowed her head upon her arms. "Do I not know what it was? I have seen--I have seen. O Lewis,
Lewis!"

"It is broken," he said, "and though the desert is yet around me, my feet have found the path.
To-morrow, Jacqueline, I give myself up."

She uttered a cry, turned, and threw herself into his arms. "To-morrow! O Love!"

He bent over her with broken words of self-reproach. She stopped him with her hand against
his lips. "No, I am not all unhappy--no, you have not broken my heart--you have not ruined
my life! Don't say it--don't think it! I love you as I loved you in the garden at Fontenoy,
as I loved on our wedding eve, in the house on the Three-Notched Road! I love you more deeply
now than then--"

"I have come," he answered, "to be sorry for almost all my life. Even to my father I might
have been a better son. The best friend a young man ever had--that was Mr. Jefferson to me!
and it all ended in the letter which he wrote last August. I was a leader in a party in whose
principles I believed and still believe, and I betrayed my party. To-night I think I could
give my life for one imperilled field, for one green acre of this land--and yet I was willing
to bring upon it strife and dissension. Ingrate and traitor--hard words and true, hard words
and true! I might have had a friend--and always I knew he was the man I would have wished to
be--but, instead, I thought of him as my foe and I killed him. I have brought trouble on many,
and good to very few. Mozart transposed life into music, Wagner and his pupils transposed problems
of life. Wagner questions and receives no answer. Mozart affirms life. His "Don Juan" liberates,
"Tannhäuser" leads into the labyrinth of bothersome renunciation.

The night wind blew against them. Fireflies shone and grey moths went by to the lighted windows;
above the treetops a bat wheeled and wheeled. The clock struck again, then from far away a
whippoorwill began to call. They sat side by side upon the doorstone, her head against his
shoulder, their hands locked.

"What will you do?" he said. "What will you do? Day and night I think of that!"

"Could I stay on here? I would like to."

"I have put all affairs in order. The place and the servants are yours. I'vee paid every debt,
I think. Mocket knows--he'll show you. But to live on here alone--"

"It will be the less alone. Don't fear for me--don't think for me. I will find courage. To-morrow!"

"It is best," he said, "that I should tell you that which others may think to comfort you with.
It is possible, but I do not consider it probable, that the sentence will be death. It will
be, I think, the Penitentiary. I had rather it was the other."

After a time she spoke, though with difficulty. "Yes--I had rather--for you. For myself, I
feel to-night that just to know you were alive would be happiness enough. Either way--either
way--to have loved you has been for me my crown of life!"

"I have written to Colonel Churchill, and a line to Fairfax Cary. There was much to do at the
last. Now it is all done, and I will go early in the morning. You knew that it was drawing
to this end--"

"Yes, I knew--I knew. Lewis, Lewis! what will you do yonder all the days the months--the--the
years to come? Oh, unendurable! O God, have mercy!"

"I will work," he answered. "It is work, Jacqueline, with me--it is work or die! I will work.
That which I have brought upon myself I will try to endure. And out of effort may come at last--I
know not what."

They sat still upon the stone. The wind sank, the air grew colder; near and far there gathered
a feeling of the north, a sense of loneliness and untrodden space. The whippoorwill called again.

Rand shuddered. "Our last night--it is our last night. Look!--a star shot over the Three-Notched
Road."

Jacqueline slipped from his clasp and stood upright, with her hands over her ears. "Come indoors--come
indoors! I cannot bear the whippoorwill!"

Early the next morning he rode away. Halfway down the drive he looked back and saw her standing
under the beech tree. She raised her hand, her scarf fluttering back from it. It was the gesture
of a princess, watching a knight ride from her tower. The green boughs came between them; he
was gone, and she sank down upon the bench beneath the tree. It was there that Major Edward
found her, an hour later.

Rand passed along the old, familiar road. He travelled neither fast nor slow, and he kept a
level gaze. The May morning was fresh and sweet, the land to either side ploughed earth or
vernal green, the little stream laughing through the meadow. He passed a field where negroes
were transplanting tobacco, and his mind noted the height and nature of the leaf. At the Greenwood
road he looked mechanically toward the distant house, but upon this morning he hardly thought
of Cary. He thought of Gideon Rand, and of the great casks of tobacco which he and his father
used to roll; of the old, strong horses, and of a lean and surly dog that they had owned; of
the slow journeys, and of their fires at night, beneath the gum and the pine, beside wastes
of broom sedge.

He came into Charlottesville and rode down Main Street to the Eagle, where he dismounted. We
cannot evade them, we must encounter them. They are not only unavoidable, but necessary to our
dearest interests, as we see, since they are strewn as thorns and brambles all along the narrow
way that leads to eternal life.

The shady place had always a contingent of happy idlers, men and boys lounging under the trees
or upon the Court House steps. These greeted Lewis Rand with deference, and turned from their
bountiful lack of occupation to watch him cross the grass and enter the Court House. "He's
gone," remarked one, "straight to the sheriff's office. What's his business there?"

The next day and the next the idlers in the Court House yard knew all the business, and rolled
it under their tongues. They loved a tragedy, and this curtain had gone up with promise. Had
they not seen Lewis Rand walk into the yard--had they not spoken to him and he to them--had
they not watched him enter the Court House? The boy who minded the sheriff's door found himself
a hero, and the words treasured that fell from his tongue. It was true that he had been sent
away and so had heard but little, but the increasing crowd found that little of interest. "Yes,
sir, that's what he said, and just as quiet as you are! 'Is the sheriff in, Michael?' he asked.
'Tell him, please, that I want to see him.' That's what he said, and Mr. Garrett he calls out,
'Come in, Mr. Rand, come in!'"

Other voices claimed attention. "And when they dragged Indian Run yesterday, there was the
pistol at the bottom of a pool--his name upon it, just as he told them it would be--"

"Fairfax Cary was in the court room yesterday when he was committed. He and Lewis Rand spoke
to each other, but no one heard what they said."

The boy came to the front again. "I didn't hear much that morning before Mr. Garrett sent me
away, but I heard why he gave himself up. I thought it wasn't much of a reason--"

The crowd pressed closer, "What was it, Michael, what was it?"

"It sounds foolish," answered the boy, "but I've got it right. He said he must have sleep."
