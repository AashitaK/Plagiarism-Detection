"A party of ten secretaries, who had spent the previous year in Central Russia under the Bolshevik
regime, landed in the first week of October, having come around from Sweden and Norway. Two
weeks later another ten secretaries arrived from the same starting point. These men formed
the nucleus of the "Y" personnel which was to serve the American troops through the winter
and spring. They were sent to points at the front immediately after their arrival, and more
than a few doughboys will remember the first trip of the big railroad car to the front south
of Obozerskaya, with Frank Olmstead in charge.

"The British Y. M. C. A. sent a party of twenty-five secretaries to Archangel early in the
fall and considerations of practical policy made it advisable to combine operations under the
title of the Allied Y. M. C. A. To the credit of the British secretaries, it must be said that
they turned over all their supplies to the American management. These supplies constituted
practically all the stock of biscuit and canteen products used until Christmas time, and British
secretaries took their places under the direction of the American headquarters.

"The "Y" was fortunate to have secured several trucks and Ford cars in a shipment before the
Allied landing, and they became part of the expeditionary transport system at once. The Supply
Company of the 339th used one truck, and the British transport staff borrowed the other one.
Major Ely, Quartermaster of the American forces, got one of the Fords, and another one went
to the American Red Cross.

"By the middle of November the "Y" had secretaries on the river fronts near Seletskoe and Beresnik
at the railroad front and with the Pinega detachment. Supplies dribbled through to them in
pitifully small amounts, usually half of the stuff stolen before it reached the front. The
British N. A. B. C. sold considerable quantities of biscuit and cigarettes to the "Y," both
at the front bases and from the Archangel depot. On the railroad front a really respectable
service was maintained, because transport was not so difficult. One secretary made the trip
around the blockhouses and outposts daily with a couple of packsacks filled with gum, candy
and cigarettes, which were distributed as generously as the small capacity of the sacks permitted.
Two cars equipped with tables for reading and writing and with a big cocoa urn were stationed
at Verst 455, where the headquarters train and reserve units stood. These cars were moved to
points north and south on the line twice weekly for small detachments to get their ration of
biscuit and sweets, small as it was.

"Another row of cars was maintained at Obozerskaya, where the first outpost entertainment hut
was opened about Christmas time with a program of moving pictures, athletic stunts and feeds.
Shipments were made from this base to the secretaries at Seletskoe, who did their best to make
the winter less monotonous and miserable for the second battalion men stationed on that front.
The "Y" opened a hut in Pinega in early November, and by the middle of December had established
a point for the "H" Company men west of Emtsa on, the Onega River line.

"Meanwhile, the Central "Y" hut at Archangel had been remodelled and fully equipped for handling
large crowds, and it served several hundred allied soldiers daily. Whenever a company of Americans
came in from the front, a special night was arranged for them to have a program in the theatre
hall, with movies, songs, stunts and eats on the bill. A series of basketball games was carried
on between the base unit companies and other commands which were in Archangel for a week or
more awaiting transfer to another point. Huts were opened in the Smolny base camp at Solombola,
both of them barely large enough to afford room for a cocoa and biscuit counter, a piano, and
a reading room. Shortly after Christmas another "Y" station was put in commission across the
river at the Preestin railroad terminal, where detachments and individuals often endured a
long wait in the cold or arrived chilled to the bone from a trip on the heatless cars.

"About Christmas time twenty-five more secretaries arrived from the American Y. M. C. A. headquarters
in England, and with this addition to personnel, it was possible to make headquarters something
more than a table and a telephone. A fairly efficient supply and office staff was built up
and with the landing of two or three belated cargoes, "Y" folk began to see a rosier period
ahead. But transport difficulties made it almost impossible to get stuff moved to the front,
where the men needed it most. 'When there are neither guns nor ammunition enough,' said the
British headquarters, 'how can we afford to take sleds for sending up biscuits and cigarettes?'

"Nevertheless, by hook or crook, several convoys were pushed through to Bereznik, each time
reviving the hopes of the men in the outposts, who thought at last they might get some regular
service. Tom Cotton and "Husky" Merrill, two football stars from Dartmouth, were in charge
of the "Y" points on the Dvina advanced front, and whatever success the "Y" attained in that
vicinity belongs primarily to their credit. They ended an eventful career in the spring of
1919 by getting captured when the Bolsheviks and Russian mutineers staged a coup d'etat at
Toulgas and captured the village. Their escape was more a matter of luck than of planning.
They paddled down the river in a boat. In their hasty exit from the village, they left behind
all their personal belongings.

"At Shenkursk the "Y" hut and stock also fell to the Bolos, but the secretaries got out with
the troops. The column which made the terrible retreat from Shenkursk found the "Y" waiting
for it at Shegovari, with hot cocoa and biscuit. Despite the congested transport, the service
on this line was kept up all through the winter and spring, "Dad" Albertson, "Ken" Hollinshead
and Brackett Lewis making themselves mighty effective in their service to the men on this sector.
Albertson has written a book, "Fighting Without a War," which embodies his experiences and
observations with the doughboys at the front.

"One of the best pieces of service performed by the "Y" during the whole campaign was carried
on at the time of the fierce Bolshevik drive for Obozerskaya from the west in February and
March. This drive cost the "Y" two of its best secretaries, but service was maintained without
a break from the first day until the end when the Bolos retreated. Merle Arnold was in the
village running a "Y" post when the attack occurred and was captured along with six American
soldiers. Bryant Ryall, who ran the "Y" tent in the woods at Verst 18, next fell a victim to
the Bolos, while on the way to Obozerskaya for more supplies. Olmstead, who came from 455 to
help in this desperate place, remained, and as a result of his work at this front, received
the French Croix de Guerre and the Russian St. George Cross.

"Other decorations were awarded to Ernest Rand on the Pinega sector and to "Dad" Albertson
on the Dvina front, both of them receiving the St. George Cross. The British military medal
was to have been given Albertson, but technicalities made it impossible. Several other secretaries
were mentioned in despatches by the American and British commands, all of them for service
at the fighting front. It was the policy of the "Y" from the start to send the best men to
the front, rush the best supplies to the front, give the men from the front the best service
while at the base camps, and do it without thought of payment. It is a fact that the Archangel
'show' cost the "Y" more per capita served than any other piece of front service rendered overseas.
The heavy cost was accentuated by the immense loss to supplies in the supply ships, warehouses
and cars or convoys, from theft and breakage and freezing. The totals of the business done
by the "Y" up in the Russian Arctic area are astounding, when the difficulties of transport
are considered More than $1,000,000 worth of supplies were received and distributed before
the American troops left Archangel. This included twenty-five motion picture outfits, everyone
of which was in use by late spring, a million and a half feet of film, fairly large shipments
of athletic goods, baseball equipment and phonographs, and thousands of books and magazines,
which filled a most important part in the program. Until early spring the "Y" bought most of
its canteen supplies from the British N. A. C. B., through a credit established in London.
These stocks were sold to the "Y" virtually at the British retail prices and were resold at
the same figures, with a resulting loss to the "Y," as the loss and damage mounted up to forty
per cent at times. In May, several shipments of American canteen stocks arrived at Archangel,
which enabled the secretaries to cut loose the strings on 'ration plans' before the troops
started home.

"A hut was opened at the embarkation point, Economia, in the early spring, and troops quartered
there had a complete red triangle service ready for them when sailing time arrived. A secretary
or two went with each transport, equipped with a small stock of sweets and cigarettes to distribute
on the voyage. Most of the American secretaries did not leave, however, until after the troops
departed. Some of them remained until the closing act of the show in August. Two more were
captured when the Bolos staged their mutiny at Onega. All these men eventually were released
from captivity in Moscow and reached America safely.

"The Y. M. C. A. received hearty co-operation from the American Red Cross, from the American
Embassy, and from the American headquarters units. Sugar and cocoa were turned over frequently
by the Red Cross when the "Y" ran completely out of stocks and an unstinted use of Red Cross
facilities was open at all times to the "Y" men. The embassy and consulate transmitted the
"Y" cables through their offices to England and America and co-operated with urgent pleas for
aid at times when such pleas were essential to the adoption of policies to better the "Y" service.
The headquarters of the 339th Infantry and the 310th Engineers responded to every reasonable
request made by the "Y" for assignments of helpers, huts or other facilities in the different
areas where work was carried on. The naval command showed special courtesies in forwarding
supplies on cruisers and despatch boats from England and Murmansk and in permitting the "Y"
men to travel on their ships.

"Altogether more than sixty American secretaries took part in the North Russian show. About
eight or ten of them, however, were on the Murmansk line, and were said by the American command
to have done good work with the engineers and sailors in that area. Whatever record the American
"Y" made in North Russia, it can in truth be said of the secretarial force that with few exceptions
they gave the best that was in them and they never felt satisfied with their work. The service
which Olmstead and Cotton and Arnold and Albertson and Beekman and a dozen others rendered,
ranks with the best work done by the Y. M. C. A. men in any part of the world. Correspondents
from the front in France and members of the American command who arrived late in the day, expressed
their surprise and gratification at the spirit which animated the "Y" workers up in the Russian
Arctic region. But the best test is the record which lives in the hearts of American soldiers,
and on their fairminded testimony the "Y" men wish to secure their verdict for whatever they
deserve for their service in North Russia with the American soldiers fighting the Bolsheviki."

TO OUR Y. W. C. A. AMERICAN GIRLS

In that old school reader of ours we used to read with wet eyes and tight throat the story
of the soldier who lay dying at Bingen on the Rhine and told his buddie to tell his sister
to be kind to all the comrades. How he yearned for the touch of his mother's or sister's hand
in that last hour, how the voice of woman and her liquid eye of love could soothe his dying
moments. And the veterans of the World War now understand that poetic sentiment better than
they did when as barefooted boys they tried to conceal their emotions behind the covers of
the book, for in the unlovely grime and grind of war the soldier came to long for the sight
of his own women kind. They will now miss no opportunity to sing the praises of their war time
friends, the Salvation Army Lassies and the girls of the Y. W. C. A.

In North Russia we were out of luck in the lack of Salvation Army Lassies enough to reach around
to our front, but in that isolated war area we were fortunate to receive several representatives
of the American Y. W. C. A. Some were girls who had already been in Russia for several years
in the regular mission work among the Russian people, and two of them we hasten to add right
here, were brave enough to stay behind when we cut loose from the country. Miss Dunham and
Miss Taylor were to turn back into the interior of the country and seek to help the pitiful
people of Russia. We take our hats off to them.

What doughboy will forget the first sight he caught of an American "Y" girl in North Russia?
He gave her his eyes and ears and his heart all in a minute. Was he in the hospital? Her smile
was a memory for days afterward. If a convalescent who could dance, the touch of her arm and
hand and the happy swing of the steps swayed him into forgetfulness of the pain of his wounds.
If he were off outpost duty on a sector near the front line and seeking sweets at a Y. M. C.
A. his sweets were doubled in value to him as he took them from the hand of the "Y" girl behind
the counter. Or at church service in Archangel her voice added a heavenly note to the hymn.
In the Hostess House, he watched her pass among the men showering graciousness and pleasantries
upon the whole lonesome lot of doughboys. One of the boys wrote a little poem for The American
Sentinel which may be introduced here in prose garb a la Walt Mason.

"There's a place in old Archangel, That we never will forget, And of all the cozy places, It's
the soldier's one best bet. It's the place where lonely Sammies Hit the trail for on the run,
There they serve you cake and coffee, 'Till the cake and coffee's done. And they know that
after eating, There's another pleasure yet,-- So to show how they are thoughtful, They include
a cigarette. There's a place back in the corner, Where you get your clothing checked, And the
place is yours, They tell you, --well--Or words to that effect. There are magazines a-plenty,
From the good old U. S. A. There's a cheery home-like welcome for you any time of day. Will
we, can we e'er forget them, In the future golden years, And the kindness that was rendered,
By these Lady Volunteers? Just as soon as work is finished, Don't you brush your hair and blouse,
And go double-double timing, To the cordial Hostess House?"

One of the pretty weddings in Archangel that winter was that celebrated by the boys when Miss
Childs became home-maker for Bryant Ryal, the "Y" man who was later taken prisoner by the Bolsheviki.
She was within twelve miles of him the day he was captured. Doughboys were quick to offer her
comforting assurances that he would be treated well because American "Y" men had done so much
in Russia for the Russian soldiers before the Bolshevik debacle. And when they heard that he
was actually on his way to Moscow with fair chance of liberation, they crowded the taplooska
Ryal home and made it shine radiantly with their congratulations.

But it was not the institutional service such as the Hostess House or the Huts or the box car
canteen, such as it was, which endeared the "Y" girls to the doughboys as a lot. It was the
genuine womanly friendliness of those girls.

The writer will never forget the scene at Archangel when the American soldiers left for Economia
where the ship was to take them to America. Genuine were the affectionate farewells of the
people--men, women and children; and genuine were the responses of the soldiers to those pitiable
people. Our Miss Dickerson, of the Y. W. C. A. Hostess House, was surrounded by a tearful group
of Russian High School girls who had been receiving instruction in health, sanitation and other
social betterments and catching the American Young Women's Christian Association vision of
usefulness to the sick, ignorant and unhappy ones of the community. Around her they gathered,
a beautiful picture of feminine grief in its sweet purity of girlish tears, and at the same
time a beautiful picture of promising hope for the future of Russia when all of that long-suffering
people may be reached by our tactful Christian women.

In this connection now I think of the conversation with our Miss Taylor the last Sunday we
were in Economia. She and Miss Dunham were staying on in Archangel hoping to get permission
to go into the interior of the country again. And it is reported that they did. She said to
me: "Wherever you can, back home among Christian people, tell them that these poor people here
in Russia have had their religious life so torn up by this strife that now they long for teachers
to come and help them to regain a religious expression."

A prominent worker among the College Y. M. C. A.'s in America, "Ken" Hollinshead, who was a
"Y" secretary far up on the Dvina River in the long, cold, desperate winter, also caught the
vision of the needs of the Russian people who had been Rasputinized and Leninized out of the
faith of their fathers and were pitifully like sheep without a shepherd. He remarked to the
writer that when the Bolshevist nightmare is over in Russia, he would like to go back over
there and help them to revive what was vital and essential in their old faith and to improve
it by showing them the American way of combining cleanliness with godliness, education with
creed-holding, work with piety.

Can the Russians be educated? The soldiers know that many a veteran comrade of theirs in the
war was an Americanized citizen. He had in a very few years in America gained a fine education.
The general reader of this page may look about him and discover examples for himself. Last
winter in a little church in Michigan the writer found the people subscribing to the support
of a citizen of the city who, a Russian by birth, came to this country to find work and opportunity.
He was drawn into the so-called mission church in the foreign settlement of the city, learned
to speak and read English, caught a desire for education, is well-educated and now with his
American bride goes to Russia on a Christian mission, to labor for the improvement of his own
nation. He is to be supported by that little congregation of American people who have a vision
of the kind of help Russia needs from our people.

Another story may be told. When the writer saw her first in Russia, she was the centre of interest
on the little community entertainment hall dance floor. She had the manner of a lady trying
to make everyone at ease. American soldiers and Russian soldiers and civil populace had gathered
at the hall for a long program--a Russian drama, soldier stunts, a raffle, a dance which consisted
of simple ballet and folk dances. The proceeds of the entertainment were to go toward furnishing
bed linen, etc., for the Red Cross Hospital being organized by the school superintendent and
his friends for the service of many wounded men who were falling in the defense of their area.

She was trim of figure and animated of countenance. Her hair was dressed as American women
attractively do theirs. Her costume was dainty and her feet shod in English or American shoes.
We could not understand a word of her Russian tongue but were charmed by its friendly and well-mannered
modulations. We made inquiries about her. She was the wife of a man who, till the Bolsheviki
drove the "intelligenza" out, had been a professor in an agricultural school of a high order.
Now they were far north, seeking safety in their old peasant city and she was doing stenographer
duty in the county government office.

We often mused upon the transformation. Only a few years before she had been as one of the
countless peasant girls of the dull-faced, ill-dressed, red-handed, coarse-voiced type which
we had seen everywhere with tools and implements of drudgery, never with things of refinement,
except, perhaps, when we had seen them spinning or weaving. And here before us was one who
had come out from among them, a sight for weary eyes and a gladness to heavy ears. How had
she accomplished the metamorphosis? The school had done it, or rather helped her to the opportunity
to rise. She had come to the city-village high school and completed the course and then with
her ability to patter the keys of a Russian typewriter's thirty-six lettered keyboard, had
travelled from Archangel to Moscow, to Petrograd, to Paris, to complete her education. And
she told the writer one time that she regretted she had not gone to London and New York before
she married the young Russian college professor.

The school,--the common school and the high school--therein lies the hope of Russia. What that
woman has done, has been done by many another ambitious Russian girl and will be done by many
girls of Russia. Russian boys and girls if given the advantages of the public school will develop
the Russian nation.

"DOBRA" CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

Description Of Hospital Building--Grateful Memories--Summary Of Medical And Surgical Cases--Feeding
The Convalescents--Care And Entertainment --Captain Greenleaf Fine Manager.

The American Convalescent Hospital at Archangel, Russia (American Expeditionary Forces, North
Russia), was opened October 1, 1918, in a building formerly used as a Naval School of Merchant
Sailors. A two and one-half story building, facing the Dvina River and surrounded by about
two acres of land, over one-half of which was covered with an attractive growth of white birch
trees. The entire building, with the exception of one room, Chief Surgeon's Office, and two
smaller rooms, for personnel of the Chief Surgeon's Office and the Convalescent Hospital, was
devoted to the American convalescent patients and their care. The half story, eighty-five by
eighty-five feet square, over the main building, was used for drying clothes and as a store
room. The building proper was of wood construction, with two wings (one story) constructed
with 24-inch brick and plaster walls. The floors were wood, the walls smoothly plastered and
the general appearance, inside and outside, attractive.

In addition to the inside latrines, an outside latrine with five seats and a urinal was built
by our men. This latrine contained a heater.

Nearly all the windows, throughout the building, were double sash and glass and could be opened
for sufficient air, dependent upon the outside temperature. The first floor ceilings were fourteen
feet in height, those on the second floor were twelve feet high. No patient had less than six
hundred cubic feet of air space.

Large brick stoves, one in the smaller and two in the larger rooms, heavily constructed and
lined with fire brick, heated the building. A wood fire was built in these stoves twice daily,
with sufficient heat being thrown off to produce a comfortable, uniform temperature at all
times. The building was lighted by electricity. The entire building was rewired by American
electricians and extra lights placed as necessary. The beds were wooden frame with heavy canvas
support. These beds were made by American carpenters. Each patient was supplied with five blankets.

During the first four months it was necessary for the men to use a near-by Russian bath-house
for bathing. This was done weekly and a check kept upon the patients. February 1st, 1919, a
wing was completed with a Thresh Disinfector (for blankets and clothing), a wash room and three
showers. A large boiler furnished hot water at all hours. The construction of this building
was begun November 1st, 1918, but inability to obtain a boiler and plumbing materials deferred
its completion. Three women were employed for washing and ironing, and clean clothing was available
at all times.

Water buckets were located on shelves in accessible places throughout the building for use
in case of fire. Each floor had a hose attachment. Two fires from overheated stoves were successfully
extinguished without injury to patients or material damage to the building. The main floors
were scrubbed daily with a two per cent creosole solution, the entire floor space every other
day. All rooms contained sufficient box cuspidors filled with sawdust.

The kitchen contained a large brick stove and ovens and this, in conjunction with a smaller
stove on the second floor, could be utilized to prepare food for three hundred men. Bartering
with the Russians was permitted. By this means, as well as comforts supplied by the American
Red Cross, such as cocoa, chocolate, raisins, condensed milk, honey, sugar, fruit (dried and
canned), oatmeal, corn meal, rice, dates and egg powder, a well balanced diet was maintained
throughout the winter. Semi-monthly reports of all exchanges, by bartering, were forwarded
to Headquarters. The usual mess kits and mess line were employed. The large dining and recreation
room had sufficient tables and benches to seat all patients. Boiled drinking water was accessible
at all times. During the eight months the Hospital has been operating, over 3,872 pounds of
grease, 2,138 pounds of bones and 8,460 pounds of broken and stale bread have been bartered
with Russian peasants. In return, besides eggs, fish, veal and other vegetables over 32,600
pounds (902 poods) of potatoes have been received. Accompanying this report is a statement
(a) of British rations (one week issue), (b) a statement of food barter (17 days) and (c) the
menu for one week.

The large room, facing the river, twenty-eight feet by sixty-one feet, was available for mess
hall, recreation and entertainments. The space, twenty-eight feet by twenty-one feet, was separated
by a projecting wall and pillars and contained a victrola and records, a piano, a library (one
hundred fifty books furnished by the American Red Cross, exchanged at intervals), a magazine
rack, reading table, machine guns and rack, a bulletin board and several comfortable chairs
made by convalescents. A portable stage for entertainments was placed in this space when required.
A complete set of scenery with flies and curtains was presented by the American Red Cross.
In the center of the room a regulation boxing ring could be strung, the benches and tables
being so arranged as to form an amphitheatre. The entire room could be cleared for dancing.
At one end was a movie screen and in the adjoining room a No. 6 Powers movie machine which
was obtained from the American Y. M. C. A. and installed December 5th, 1918.

During the winter the following entertainments were given:

Vaudeville              5 Boxing exhibitions      4 Lectures                4 Minstrel shows
2 Dances                 10 Musical entertainments  6 Russian                 3 English   
2 Band concert            1 Kangaroo court          1

A twelve-piece orchestra from the 339th Infantry band furnished music for the dances as well
as occasionally during Sunday dinners. Each Wednesday and Sunday nights moving pictures were
shown. These included a number of war films showing operations on the Western Front and productions
of Fairbanks, Farnum, Billy Burke, Eltinge, Hart, Mary Pickford, Kerrigan, Arbuckle, Bunny
and Chaplin. During May baseballs, gloves and bats have been supplied by the American Y. M.
C. A. Sunday afternoons religious services were conducted by chaplains of the American Force.

Canteen supplies, consisting of chocolate, stick candy, gum, cigars, cigarettes, smoking and
chewing tobacco, toilet soap, tooth paste, canned fruits (pineapple, pears, cherries, apricots,
peaches) and canned vegetables could be purchased from the Supply Company, 339th Infantry.
These supplies were drawn on the first of each month and furnished the men at cost.

The personnel consisted of Capt. C. A. Greenleaf, Commanding Officer, Medical Corps; an officer
from the Supply Company, 339th Infantry (charge of equipment); two Sergeants, Medical Corps;
three Privates, Medical Corps. With these exceptions all the details required for the care
and maintenance of the hospital were furnished by men selected from the convalescent patients.

It took seventy-six men every day for the various kitchen, cleaning, clerical and guard details
and in addition other details from convalescent patients were made as follows: Six patrols
of ten men each, each patrol in charge of a non-commissioned officer and three sections of
machine gunners were always prepared for an emergency. Guards were furnished for Headquarters
building. Two type-setters and one proof-reader reported for work, daily, at the office of
The American Sentinel (a weekly publication for the American troops). Typists, stenographers
and clerks were furnished different departments at Headquarters as required. Orderlies, kitchen
police and cooks were furnished to the American Red Cross Hospital and helpers to American
Red Cross Headquarters. This was light work always which was conducive to the convalescence
of the men.

Captain Greenleaf always managed to care for all patients. On January 18th, 1919, a ward was
opened at Olga Barracks which accommodated twenty-five patients. These patients were rationed
by Headquarters Company and reported for sick call at the infirmary located in the same building.

On March 11th, 1919, an Annex was opened at Smolny Barracks with eighty beds. For this purpose
a barracks formerly occupied by enlisted men was remodelled. New floors were put in, the entire
building sheathed on the inside, rooms constructed for office and sick call and a kitchen in
which a new stove and ovens were built. This Annex was operated from the Convalescent Hospital,
one Sergeant, Medical Corps, and two Privates, Medical Corps, were detailed to this building.
Details from the patients operated the mess and took care of the building. Supplies were sent
daily from the hospital to the Annex and the mess was of the same character.

On April 28th, 1919, three tents were erected in the yard of the Hospital. Plank floors were
built, elevated on logs and these accommodated thirty-six patients. On April 28th, 1919, with
the Hospital, Annex and tents two hundred eight-two patients could be accommodated. This number
represents the maximum Convalescent Hospital capacity, during its existence and was sufficient
for the requirements of the American Forces. The ward at Olga Barracks was only used for a
few weeks.

During April eighty-two patients were discharged from the Convalescent Hospital and sent to
Smolny Barracks for "Temporary Light Duty at Base."

The Convalescent Hospital was the best place, bar none, in Russia, to eat in winter of 1918-19.
The commanding officer was fortunate to have as a patient the mess sergeant of Company "D."
That resourceful doughboy took the rations issued by the British and by systematic bartering
with the natives he built up a famous mess. Below is a verbatim extract from Captain Greenleaf's
report.

From October 1st, 1918, to June 12th, 1919, this American Convalescent Hospital served eleven
hundred and eighty out of the fifty-five hundred Americans of the expeditionary force. From
Captain Greenleaf's official report the following facts of interest are presented.

Of infectious and epidemic diseases there were two hundred and forty-six cases of which four
were mumps, one hundred and sixty-seven were influenza and the remainder complications which
resulted from influenza. The pneumonia cases developed early. One man reported from guard duty,
developed a rapidly involving pneumonia which soon became general and culminated in death within
twenty-four hours. The best results followed the use of Dovers powder and quinine,--alternation
two and one-half grains of Dovers with five grains of quinine every two hours, five to ten
grains of Dovers being given at bedtime. Expectorants were given as required. Very little stimulation
was necessary. Many of these cases, after the acute symptoms subsided, showed a persistent
tachycardia which continued for some days and in a few cases (seven) became chronic. In these
cases medication proved of little benefit, rest and a proper diet being the most efficacious
treatment. Patients convalescing from pneumonia were evacuated to England or given Base Duty.

Of tuberculosis there were only thirteen cases which were as far as possible isolated. Of venereal
cases there were only one hundred and seventy-four. They had received treatment in British
53rd Stationary Hospital, and came to the American Convalescent hospital simply for re-equipment.
Nearly all were immediately discharged to duty.

Of nervous diseases there were nineteen cases, all of which were neuritis except two cases
of paralysis. Of mental diseases and defects there were only fourteen. This is a remarkable
showing when we consider the strain of the strange, long, dark winter campaign, and of these
fourteen cases six were mental deficiency that were not detected by the experts at time of
enlistment and induction, three were hysteria, two neurasthenia, and three psychasthenia. Here
let us add that there was only one case of suicide and one case of attempted suicide.

There were eighteen eye cases and nineteen ear cases, three nose, and eighteen of the throat.
Of the circulatory system the total was sixty-eight of which twenty-two were heart trouble
and thirty-one hemorrhoids brought on by exposure.

There were eighty respiratory cases, ninety-three digestive cases, of which sixteen were appendicitis
and thirty-two were hernia. Of genito-urinary, which were non-venereal, there were twenty cases.
Of skin diseases there were thirty-nine. Scabies was the only skin lesion which has been common
among the troops. Warm baths and sulphur ointment were used with excellent results.

From exposure there were one hundred and one cases of bones and locomotion. Trench feet were
bad to treat. From external causes there were two hundred and fifty-five cases. Of these two
were burns, two dislocation, twenty-six severe frost bite cases, two exhaustion from exposure,
twenty-three fractures and sprains, and two hundred wound cases. Many severely wounded were
sent to Hospital ship "Kalyon," and many were evacuated to Base Section Three in England and
only the convalescent wounded, of course, came to the dobra convalescent hospital.

The following is Capt. Greenleaf's summary:

Patients                             1180 Hospital days, actual               17048 Hospital
days, per patient             14.45 Hospital days, awaiting evacuation  11196 Hospital days,
per patient              9.49 Hospital days, special duty          7273 Hospital days, per
patient              6.16 Hospital days, total                35517 Hospital days, per patient
30.10

NOTE--This table is made out in this manner for several reasons. In the first place evacuation
lists were submitted to the Chief Surgeon each Friday, containing a list of those patients
who were unfit for further front line duty in Russia. Lack of transportation and the long delays
in completing the evacuations should not be charged to actual hospital days. Again it was necessary,
under the conditions and owing to the fact that the hospital was dependent upon patients for
its existence, that men be selected who were competent to have charge of certain work. A most
efficient mess sergeant and competent cooks were selected. The men to have charge of the heating
system and boilers were chosen. Good interpreters were held. And many cases in which a competent
man entered as a patient, who was skillful in certain work, that man was held indefinitely,
for the good of the service and the hospital. In this summary these cases have been listed
as hospital days, special duty.

The medical care of our comrades was as well-looked after as possibly could be in North Russia.
All patients were examined, when they entered the hospital and classified. They were marked,--no
duty, light duty inside, light duty outside, light duty sitting, or light duty not involving
the use of right (or left) arm. A record, showing their organization, company, rank, duty,
diagnosis, date of admission, source of admission, room and bed, was made. Their business in
private life was considered and they were assigned to work compatible with their training.
Any medication they might need was prescribed. Owing to lack of bottles patients reported for
medicine four times daily and a record was thus kept of dosage. Patients were examined weekly
and re-classified. Sick call was held, daily, at 8:30 a. m., at which time patients requiring
special attention, reported and also, surgical dressings were applied.

The last patient was discharged to duty June 12th, 1919. We know that the one thousand one
hundred and eighty men who passed through that hospital join the writers in saying that, considering
conditions, the convalescent hospital was a wonder.

AMERICAN RED CROSS IN NORTH RUSSIA

American Red Cross On Errands Of Mercy Precede Troops--Summary Of Aid Given People--Aid And
Comforts Freely Given American Troops --Summary--Commendatory Words Of General Richardson--Our
Weekly "Sentinel" Put Out By Red Cross--Returned Men Strong For American Red Cross Work In
North Russia.

Even before the question of American participation in the Allied expedition to North Russia
had been decided upon, the American Red Cross had dispatched a mission of thirteen persons,
with four thousand two hundred tons of food and medicine, for the relief of the civilian population.
When, shortly thereafter, a considerable detachment of American doughboys, engineers and ambulance
corps troops were landed, the Red Cross had the nucleus of an organization to provide for the
needs of our soldiers as well as for the civilian population.

A report, made public here by the American Red Cross on its work in North Russia, gives an
interesting picture of conditions on our Arctic battle front during the war. The food situation
among the civilian population was acute. With the city swollen in population through a steady
influx of refugees, few fresh supplies were coming in and hoarded supplies were rapidly diminishing.
Coarse bread and fish were staple articles of food, and there was a grave shortage of clothing.

The desperate need for foodstuffs in the regions far north along the Arctic shores was brought
sharply to the attention of the Allied Food Committee when delegates from Pechora arrived by
reindeer teams and camped at the doors of the committee urging assistance. They brought samples
of the bread they were forced to eat. It was made of a small quantity of white flour mixed
with ground-up dried fish. Other samples which were shown were made from immature frostbitten
rye grain, and a third was composed of a small quantity of white flour mixed with reindeer
moss. A small quantity of rye flour mixed with chopped coarse straw, was the basis of a fourth
example.

Much attention was devoted by the Red Cross to caring for school children and orphans. Over
two million hot lunches were distributed, during a period of a few months, to three hundred
and thirty schools with twenty thousand pupils. Every orphanage in the district was outfitted
with the things it needed and received a regular fortnightly issue of food supplies. Over twenty
thousand suits of underwear were given out to refugees. To provide for the many persons separated
from their families or from employment on account of the war, the Red Cross established a regular
free employment agency.

The writer recalls having seen in Pinega in February men who had left their Petchora homes
eight months before to go to Archangel for the precious flour provided by the American Red
Cross. The civil war had made transportation slow and extremely hazardous.

Expeditions were constantly sent out from Archangel to various points with supplies of food,
clothing, and medicaments. The most extensive of the civilian relief enterprises undertaken
by the Red Cross Mission to Russia was the sending of a boat from Archangel to Kern with a
cargo of fifty-five tons. This was distributed either by the Red Cross officials themselves
or by responsible local authorities.

Food rations and clothing were given to three hundred destitute families in Archangel which,
upon careful investigation, were found to be deserving. Housing conditions were improved and
clothing, which had been salvaged from sunken steamers and lay idle in the customs house, was
dried and distributed.

Besides supplying all Russian civilian hospitals in and around Archangel regularly with medicine,
sheets, blankets, pillows and food rations, the Red Cross opened up a Red Cross hospital in
Archangel, which was finally turned over to the local government to be used as a base hospital
for the Russian army. Red Cross medicines are credited with having checked the serious influenza
epidemic and with having worked against its recurrence.

Medicaments worth one million roubles were sent by the Red Cross to the various district zemstvos.
Russian prisoners of war, returning from Germany through the Bolshevik lines to North Russia,
were also taken care of.

Work among the American soldiers in North Russia was thorough and effective. The daily ration
was supplemented and many American soldiers received from the Red Cross quantities of rolled
oats, sugar, milk, and rice, besides all the regular Red Cross comforts, including cigarettes,
stationery, chewing gum, athletic goods, playing cards, toilet articles, phonographs, sweaters,
socks, blankets, etc.

Supplies were sent as regularly as possible to the troops on the line, generally in the face
of apparently insurmountable transportation difficulties. Units of troops, even in the most
inaccessible and out of the way places, were visited by Red Cross workers, occasionally at
great danger to their lives.

With the assistance of the Red Cross The American Sentinel, a weekly newspaper, was printed
and distributed among the troops and did much to keep up their morale. One of the last acts
performed by the Red Cross for the American Expeditionary Forces in Archangel was to help and
speed to their new homes eight war brides.

The veteran of the North Russian expedition will never look at his old knit helmet or wristlets,
scarf, or perhaps eat a rare dish of rolled oats, or bite off a chew of plug, or listen to
a certain piece on the graphaphone, or look at a Red Cross Christmas Seal without a warm feeling
under his left breast pocket for the American Red Cross.

CAPTIVE DOUGHBOYS IN BOLSHEVIKDOM

Doughboy Captives Still Coming Out Of Red Russia--Red Cross Starts Prisoner Exchange In Archangel
Area--White Flag Incidents In No Man's Land--Remarkable Picture Taken--Men Who Were Liberated--Sergeant
Leitzell's Gripping Story Of Their Captivity.

In August, 1920, came out of Bolshevik Russia, as startlingly as though from the grave, Corp.
Prince of "B" Company, who had been wounded and captured at Toulgas, March 1, 1919. This leads
to our story of the captives in Bolshevikdom. One of the interesting incidents of the spring
defensive was the exchange of prisoners. It was brought about quite largely through the efforts
of the American Red Cross, which was very anxious to try to get help to the Americans still
in interior Russia, especially the prisoners of war. When the Bolsheviki captured the Allied
men at Bolsheozerki in March they took a British chaplain, who pleaded that he was a non-combatant
and belonged to a fraternal order whose principles were similar to the Soviet principles. Thinking
they had a convert, the Soviet Commissar gave Father Roach his freedom and sent him through
the lines at the railroad front in April.

News was brought back by Father Roach that many American and British and French prisoners were
at Moscow or on their way to Moscow.

Accordingly, the American Red Cross was instrumental in prevailing upon the military authorities
to open white flag conversations at the front line in regard to a possible exchange of prisoners.
A remarkable photograph is included in this volume of that first meeting. One or two other
meetings were not quite so formal. At one time the excited Bolos forgot their own men and the
enemy who were parleying in the middle of No Man's Land, and started a lively artillery duel
with the French artillery. At another time the Americans' Russian Archangel Allies got excited
and fired upon the Bolshevik soldiers who were sitting under a white flag on the railroad track
watching the American captain come towards them. Happy to say, there were no casualties by
this mistake. But it sure was a ticklish undertaking for the Americans themselves later in
the day to walk out under a flag of truce to explain the mistake and inquire about the progress
of the prisoners exchange conversations going on. At Vologda, American, British and French
officers were guests of the Bolshevik authorities. Their return was expected and came during
the first week of May.

One American soldier, Pvt. Earl Fulcher, of "H" Company, and one French soldier were brought
back and in exchange for them four former Bolshevik officers were given. Report was brought
that other soldiers were being given their freedom by the Bolshevik government and were going
out by way of Petrograd and Viborg, Finland. It was learned that some American soldiers were
in hospital under care of the Bolshevik medical men. Every effort was made by military authorities
in North Russia to clear up the fate of the many men who had been reported missing in action
and missing after ambush by the Reds who cut off an occasional patrol of Americans or British
or French soldiers.

But the Bolshevik military authorities were unable to trace all of their prisoners. In the
chaos of their organization it is not surprising. We know that our own War Department lost
Comrade Anthony Konjura, Company "A" 310th Engineers, while he was on his way home from Russia,
wounded, on the hospital ship which landed him in England. There his mother went and found
him in a hospital. An American sergeant whose story appears in this volume, says that while
he was in Moscow six British soldiers were luckily discovered by the Red authorities in a foul
prison where they had been lost track of. Even as this book goes to press we are still hoping
that others of our own American comrades and of our allies will yet come to life out of Russia
and be restored to their own land and loved ones.

Corporal Arthur Prince, of "B" Company, who was ambushed and wounded and captured in March,
1919, at Toulgas was, finally in August, 1920, released from hospital and prison in Russia
and crippled and sick joined American troops in Germany. His pluck and stamina must have been
one hundred per cent to stand it all those long seventeen months. His comrade, Herbert Schroeder,
of "B" Company, who was captured on the 21st of September, has never been found. His comrades
still hope that he was the American printer whom the Reds declared was printing their propaganda
in English for them at Viatka.

Comrade George Albers, "I" Company, in November, 1918, was on a lone observation post at the
railroad front. A Bolo reconnaissance patrol surprised and caught him. He was the American
soldier who was shown to the comrades at Kodish on the river bridge after Armistice Day. He
was afterward sent on to Moscow and went out with others to freedom. With him went out Comrades
Walter Huston and Mike Haurlik of "C" Company, who had been taken prisoners in action on November
29th near Ust Padenga on the same day that gallant Cuff and his ten men were trapped and all
were killed or captured. These two men survived. In this liberated party was also Comrade Anton
Vanis, of Company "D" who was lost in the desperate rear guard action at Shegovari. Also came
Comrade William R. Schuelke, "H" Company, who had been given up for dead. And in the party
was Merle V. Arnold, American "Y" man, who had been captured in March at Bolsheozerki. Six
of our allied comrades, Royal Scots, came out with the party. These men all owed their release
chiefly to the efforts of Mr. L. P. Penningroth, of Tipton, Iowa, Secretary of the Prisoners-of-War
Release Station in Copenhagen, who secured the release of the men by going in person to Moscow.

With the return of Comrade Schuelke we learn that he was one of the "H" Company patrol under
Corporal Collins which was ambushed near Bolsheozerki, March 17th. One of his comrades, August
Peterson, died April 12th in a Bolshevik hospital. His Corporal, Earl Collins, was in the same
hospital severely wounded. His fate is still unknown but doubtless he is under the mossy tundra.
His comrade, Josef Romatowski, was killed in the ambush, comrade John Frucce was liberated
via Finland and his comrade, Earl Fulcher, as we have seen, was exchanged on the railroad front
in May.

On March 31st two other parties of Americans were caught in ambush by the Reds who had surrounded
the Verst 18 Force near Bolsheozerki. Mechanic Jens Laursen of "M" Company was captured along
with Father Roach and the British airplane man wounded in the action which cost also the life
of Mechanic Dial of "M" Company. And at the same time another party going from the camp toward
Obozerskaya consisting of Supply Sergeant Glenn Leitzell and Pvt. Freeman Hogan of "M" Company
together with Bryant Ryal, a "Y" man, going after supplies, were captured by the Reds. These
men were all taken to Moscow and later liberated. Their story has been written up in an interesting
way by Comrade Leitzell. It fairly represents the conditions under which those prisoners of
war in Bolshevikdom suffered till they were liberated:

"On March 31st, 1919, at 8:30 a. m. I left the front lines with a comrade, Freeman Hogan, and
a Russian driver, on my way back to Obozerskaya for supplies. About a quarter of a verst, 500
yards, from our rear artillery, we were surprised by a patrol of Bolos, ten or twelve in number,
who leaped out of the snowbanks and held us up at the point of pistols, grenades and rifles.
Then they stripped us of our arms and hurried us off the road and into the woods. To our great
surprise we were joined by Mr. Ryal, the Y. M. C. A. Secretary who had been just ahead of us.

"At once they started us back to their lines with one guard in front, three in the rear and
three on snow skiis on each side of the freshly cut trail in the deep snow. We knew from the
signs and from the fire fight that soon followed that a huge force of the Reds were in rear
of our force. After seven versts through the snow we reached the village of Bolsheozerki. On
our arrival we were met by a great many Bolsheviks who occupied the villages in tremendous
numbers. Some tried to beat us with sticks and cursed and spat on us as we were shoved along
to the Bolshevik commander.

"One of the camp loiterer's scowling eyes caught sight of the sergeant's gold teeth. His cupidity
was aroused. Raising his brass-bound old whipstock he struck at the prisoner's mouth to knock
out the shining prize. But the prisoner guard saved the American soldier from the blow by shoving
him so vigorously that he sprawled in the snow while the heavy whip went whizzing harmlessly
past the soldier's ear. The Bolo sleigh driver swore and the prisoner guard scowled menacingly
at the brutal but baffled comrade. The American soldiers needed no admonitions of skora skora
to make them step lively toward the Red General's headquarters.

"One of the first things we saw on our arrival was a Russian sentry who had gone over from
our lines. They demanded our blouses and fur caps, also our watches and rings. In a little
while we saw three others arrive--Father Roach of the 17th King's Company of Liverpool and
Private Stringfellow of the Liverpools, also Mechanic Jens Laursen of our own "M" Company who
had escaped death in the machine gun ambush that had killed his comrade Mechanic Dial and driver
and horse. Later Lieut. Tatham of the Royal Air Force came in with a shattered arm. His two
companions and the sleigh drivers had been mortally wounded and left by the Bolsheviks on the road.

"After that we had our interview with a Bolshevik Intelligence Officer who tried to get information
from us. But he got no information from us as we pleaded that we were soldiers of supply and
were not familiar with the details of the scheme of defense. And it worked. He sent us away
under guard, who escorted us in safety through the camp to a shack.

"Here we were billetted in a filthy room with a lot of Russian prisoners, some the survivors
of the defense of Bolsheozerki and some the recalcitrants or suspected deserters from the Bolo
ranks. We were given half of a salt fish, a lump of sour black bread and some water for our
hunger. On the bread we had to use an ax as it was frozen. We managed to thaw some of it out
and wash it down with water. After this we stretched in exhaustion on the floor and slept off
the day and night in spite of the constant roar of Bolo guns and the bursting of shells that
were coming from our camp at Verst 18. By that sign we knew the Bolo had not overpowered our
comrades by his day's fighting. It was the only comforting thought we had as we pulled the
dirty old rags about us that the Reds had given us in exchange for our overcoats and blouses,
and went to sleep.

"We woke up in the morning midst the roar of a redoubled fight. A fine April Fool's Day we
thought. We were stiff and sore and desperately hungry. But our breakfast was the remainder
of the fish and sour bread. Later the guard relieved us of some of our trinkets and pocket
money, after which they gave us our rations for the day, consisting of a half can of horse
meat, a salt fish, and twelve ounces of black bread.

"Then we were taken to see the General commanding this huge force. He gave us a cigarette,
which was very acceptable as we were quite unnerved, not knowing what would happen to us afterwards
if we gave no more information than we had the day before. He tried to impress us by taking
his pistol and pointing out on a map of the area just where his troops were that day surrounding
our comrades in the beleagured camp in the woods at Verst 18 on the road, as well as many versts
beyond them cutting a trail through the deep snow to the very railroad in rear of Obozerskaya.
He boasted that his forces that day would crush the opposing force and he would move upon Obozerskaya
and go up and down the railroad and clear away every obstacle as he had done in the Upper Vaga
Valley, where he boasted he had driven the Allied troops from Shenkursk and pursued them for
over sixty miles. Then he informed us that we were to be sent as prisoners to Moscow.

"Later in the morning we were started south toward Emtsa on foot. We could hear the distant
cannonading on the 445 front as we marched along during the day on the winter trail which if
it had been properly patrolled by the French and Russians would not have permitted the surprise
flank march in force by this small army that menaced the whole Vologda force. Our thirty-five
verst march that day and night--for we walked till 10:00 p. m.--was made more miserable by
the thought that our comrades were up against a far greater force than they dreamed, as was
evidenced to us by the hordes of men we had seen in Bolsheozerki and the transportation that
filled every verst of the trail from the south. We made temporary camp in a log hut along the
road, building a roaring fire outside. We would sleep a half hour and then go outside the hut
to thaw out by the fire, and so on through the wretched night.

"At 4:00 a. m. we started again our footsore march, after a fragment of black bread and a swallow
of water, and walked twenty-seven versts to Shelaxa, the Red concentration camp. Here we underwent
a minute search. All papers were taken for examination. Our American money was returned to
us, as was later a check on a London bank which one of my officers had given me. I secreted
it and some money so well in a waist belt that later I had the satisfaction of cashing the
check in Sweden into kronen in King Gustave's Royal Bank in Stockholm. After a meal of salt
fish and black bread fried in fish oil, and some hot water to drink, we were given an hour's
rest and then started on the road again to Emtsa, twenty-four versts away, reaching that railroad
point at midnight. Here we were brought before the camp commandant who roughly stripped us
of all our clothes except our breeches and gave us the Bolshevik underwear and ragged outer
garments that they had discarded. And buddies who have seen Bolo prisoners come into our lines
can imagine how bad a discarded Bolo coat or undershirt must be. After this we were locked
up in a box car with no fire and three guards over us.

"Next morning, April 3rd, the car door was opened and the Bolshevik soldiers made angry demonstrations
toward us and were kept out only by our guards' bayonets. We were fed some barley wash and
the rye bread which tasted wonderful after the previous food. I paid a British two-shilling
piece which I had concealed in my shoe to a guard to get me a tin to put our food in, and we
made wooden spoons. That night we were lined up against the car and asked if we knew that we
were going to be shot. But this event, I am happy to say, never took place. We went by train
to Plesetskaya that day. Father Roach was taken to the commandant's quarters and we did not
see him till the next day, when he told us he had enjoyed a fine night's sleep and expected
to be sent back across the lines and would take messages to our comrades to let them know we
were alive and on our way to Moscow."

It is interesting to note that the American Sergeant's insistence that he and his companions
be given bath and means to shave, won the respect and assistance of the guard and the Bolshevik
officer. Of course in making the two day's march in prisoner convoy from Bolsheozerki to Emtsa
there had been severe hardship and privation and painful uncertainty and mental agony over
their possible fate. And they had not stopped long enough in one place to enable them to make
an appeal for fair treatment.

Imagine the three American soldiers and the "Y" man and the two British soldiers sitting disconsolately
in a filthy taplooshka, hands and faces with three days and nights of grime and dirt, scratching
themselves under their dirty rags, cussing the active cooties that had come with the shirts,
and trying to soothe their itching bewhiskered faces. Here the resourceful old sergeant keenly
picked out the cleanest one of the guards and approached him with signs and his limited Russki
gavareet and made his protest at being left dirty. He won out. The soldier horoshawed several
times and seechassed away to return a few minutes later with a long Russian blade and a tiny
green cake of soap and a tin of hot water. Under the stimulation of a small silver coin from
the sergeant's store he assumed the role of barber and smoothed up the faces of the whole crowd
of prisoners. And then followed the trip under guard to the steaming bath-house that is such
a vivid memory to all soldiers who soldiered up there under the Arctic Circle. In this connection
it may be related that later on at Moscow the obliging Commissar of the block in which they
were quartered hunted up for them razors and soap and even found for them tooth brushes and
tubes of toothpaste which had been made in Detroit, U. S. A., and sold to Moscow merchants
in a happier time.

"On April 5th we left Plesetskaya, after saying good-bye to the English Chaplain who seemed
greatly pleased that he was to get his freedom and had his pockets full of Bolshevik propaganda.
We reached Naundoma after a night of terrible cold in the unheated car and during the next
two days on the railway journey to Vologda had nothing to eat. On April 7th we reached that
city and were locked up with about twenty Russians. Here we got some black bread that seemed
to have sand in it and some sour cabbage soup which we all shared, Russians and all, from a
single bucket. Next day we thought it a real improvement to have a separate tin and a single
wooden spoon for the forlorn group of Americans and British.

"At Plesetskaya we were questioned very thoroughly by a Russian officer who spoke English very
well and showed marked sympathy toward us and saw to it that we were better treated, and later
in Moscow saw to it that we had some small favors. In three days' time we were again on the
train for Moscow, travelling in what seemed luxury after our late experience. The trains to
Moscow ran only once a week as there were no materials to keep up the equipment.

"On our arrival we found the streets sloppy and muddy, with heaps of ice and snow and dead
horses among the rubbish. Few business places were open, all stores having been looted. Here
and there was a semi-illicit stand where horsemeat, salt fish, carrots or cabbage and parsnips,
and sour milk could be bought on the sly if you had the price. But it was very little at any
price and exceedingly uncertain of appearance. We were sent to join the other prisoners, French,
English, Scotch and Americans who had preceded us from the front to Moscow. They had tales
similar to ours to tell us.

"The next morning at 10:00 a. m. we were wondering when we would eat. The answer was: Twelve
noon. Cabbage soup headed the menu, then came dead horse meat, or salt fish if you chose it,
black bread and water. Same menu for supper. We learned that the people of the city fared scarcely
better. All were rationed. The soldiers and officials of the Bolsheviks fared better than the
others. Children were favored to some extent. But the 'intelligenza' and the former capitalists
were in sore straits. Many were almost starving. Death rate was high. The soldier got a pound
of bread, workmen half a pound, others a quarter of a pound. In this way they maintained their
army. Fight, work for the Red government or starve. Some argument. Liberty is unknown under
the Soviet rule. Their motto as I saw it is: What is yours is mine.'"

Captivity with all its desperate hardships and baleful uncertainties, had its occasional brighter
thread. The American boys feel especially grateful to Mr. Merle V. Arnold, of. Lincoln, Nebraska,
the American Y. M. C. A. man who had been captured by the Red Guards a few days preceding their
capture. He was able to do things for them when they reached Moscow. And when he was almost
immediately given his liberty and allowed to go out through Finland, he did not forget the
boys he left behind. He carried their case to the British and Danish Red Cross and a weekly
allowance of 200 roubles found its way over the belligerent lines to Moscow and was given to
the boys, much to the grateful assistance of the starving allied prisoners of war.

But they became resourceful as all American soldiers seem to become, whether at Bakaritza,
Smolny, Archangel, Kholmogora, Moscow or wherenot, and they found ways of adding to their rations.
Imagine one of them lining up with the employees of a Bolo public soup kitchen and going through
ostensibly to do some work and playing now-you-see-it-now-you-don't-see-it with a dish of salt
or a head of cabbage or a loaf of bread or a chunk of sugar, or when on friendly terms with
the Bolshevik public employees volunteering to help do some work that led them to where a little
money would buy something on the side at inside employees' prices. Imagine them with their
little brass kettle, stewing it over their little Russian sheet-iron stove, stirring in their
birdseed substitute for rolled oats and potatoes and cabbage and perhaps a few shreds of as
clean a piece of meat as they could buy, on the sly. See the big wooden spoons travelling happily
from pot to lips and hear the chorus of Dobra, dobra.

They will not ever forget the English Red Cross woman who constantly looked out for the five
Americans, the thirty-five British and fifteen French prisoners, finding ways to get for them
occasional morsels of bacon and bread and small packages of tea and tobacco. On Easter day
she entertained them all in the old palace of Ivan the Terrible.

How good it was one day to meet an American woman who had eighteen years before married a Russian
in Chicago and come to Moscow to live. Her husband was a grain buyer for the Bolshevik government
but she was a hater of the Red Rule and gave the boys all the comfort she could, which was
little owing to the surveillance of the Red authorities.

And one day the sergeant met an American dentist who had for many years been the tooth mechanic
for the old Czar and his family. He fixed up a tooth as best he could for the American soldier.
The Reds had about stripped him but left him his tools and his shop so that he could serve
the Red rulers when their molars and canines needed attention.

The American boys gained the confidence of the Russians in Moscow just as they had always done
in North Russia. They were finally given permission to participate in the privileges of one
of the numerous clubs that the Red officials furnished up lavishly for themselves in the palatial
quarters of old Moscow. Here they could find literature and lectures and lounging room and
for a few roubles often gained a hot plate of good soup or a delicacy in the shape of a horse
steak. Of course the latter was always a little dubious to the American doughboy, for in walking
the street he too often saw the poor horse that dropped dead from starvation or overdriving,
approached by the butcher with the long knife. He merely raised the horse's tail, slashed around
the anal opening of the animal with his blade, then reached in his great arm and drew out the
entrails and cast them to one side for the dogs to growl and fight over. Later would come the
sleigh with axes and other knives to cut up the frozen carcass. On May day the boys nearly
lost their membership in the club, along with its soup and horse-steak privileges because they
would not march in the Red parade to the gaily decorated square to hear Lenin speak to his
subjects.

Was the Red government able to feed the people by commandeering, the food? No. At last the
peasants gained the sufferance of the Red rulers to traffic their foodstuffs on the streets
even as we have seen them with handfuls of vegetables on the market streets of Archangel. Prices
were out of sight. Under a shawl in a tiny box, an old peasant woman on Easter Day was offering
covertly a few eggs at two hundred roubles apiece.

Imagine the feelings of the boys when they walked about freely as they did, being dressed in
the regular Russian long coats and caps and being treated with courtesy by all Russians who
recognized them as Americans. Here they found themselves looking at the great hotel built on
American lines of architecture to please the eye and shelter the American travellers of the
olden times before the great war, a building now used by the Red Department of State. Here
they were examined by one of Tchicherin's men upon their arrival in the Red capital. Further
they could walk about the Kremlin, and visit a part of it on special occasions. They could
see the execution block and the huge space laid out by Ivan the Terrible, where thousands of
Russians bled this life away at the behest of a cruel government.

Or they could stand before the St. Saveur cathedral, a noble structure of solid marble with
glorious murals within to remind the Slavic people of their unconquerable resistance to the
great Napoleon and of his disastrous retreat from their beloved Moscow.

They cannot be blamed for coming out of Moscow convinced that the heart of the Slavic people
is not in this Bolshevik class hatred and class dictatorship stuff of Lenin and Trotsky; equally
convinced that the heart of the Russian people is not unfearful of the attempted return of
the old royalist bureaucrats to their baleful power, and convinced that the heart of this great,
courteous, patient, longsuffering Slavic people is groping for expression of self-government,
and that America is their ideal--a hazy ideal and one that they aspire toward only in general
outlines. Their ultimate self-government may not take the shape of American constitutionalism,
but Russian self-government must in time come out of the very wrack of foreign and internecine
war. And every American soldier who fought the Bolshevik Russian in arms or stood on the battle
line beside the Archangel Republic anti-Bolshevik Russian, might join these returned captives
from Bolshevikdom in wishing that there may soon come peace to that land, and that they may
develop self-government.

"We finally received our release. We had known of the liberation of Mr. Arnold and several
of our North Russian comrades and had been hoping for our turn to come. Mr. Frank Taylor, an
Associated Press correspondent, was helpful to us, declaring to the Bolshevik rulers that American
troops were withdrawing from Archangel. We had been faithful (sic) to the lectures, for a purpose
of dissimulation, and the Red fanatics really thought we were converted to the silly stuff
called bolshevism. It was plain to us also that they were playing for recognition of their
government by the United States. So we were given passports for Finland. The propaganda did
not deceive us.

"At the border a suspicious sailor on guard searched us. He turned many back to Petrograd.
The train pulled back carrying four hundred women and children and babies disappointed at the
very door to freedom, weeping, penniless, and starving, starting back into Russia all to suit
the whim of an ignorant under officer. Under the influence of flattery he softened toward us
and after robbing us of everything that had been provided us by our friends for the journey,
taking even the official papers sent by the Bolshevik government to our government which we
were to deliver to American representatives in Finland, he let us go.

"After he let us go we saw the soldiers in the house grabbing for the American money which
Mr. Taylor had given us. They had not thought it worth while to take the Russian roubles away
from us. Of course they were of no value to us in Finland. After a two kilometer walk, carrying
a sick English soldier with us, my three comrades and I reached the little bridge that gave
us our freedom."--By Sgt. Glenn W. Leitzell, Co. M, 339th Inf.

MILITARY DECORATIONS

In the North Russian Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki, American officers and men fought at
one time or another under the field standards of four nations, American, British, French, and
(North) Russian. And for their valor and greatly meritorious conduct, mostly over and beyond
the call of duty, many soldiers were highly commended by their field officers, American, French,
British, and Russian, in their reports to higher military authorities. Many, but not all, of
these officers and soldiers were later cited in orders and awarded decorations. Not every deserving
man received a citation. That is the luck of war.

It was a matter of keen regret to the British Commanding General that he was so hedged by orders
from England that his generous policy of awarding decorations to American soldiers was abruptly
ended in mid-winter when it became apparent that the United States would not continue the campaign
against the Bolsheviki but would withdraw American troops at the earliest possible moment.

The Russian military authorities were eager to show their appreciation of their American soldier
allies, but due to the indifference of Colonel Stewart to this not many soldiers were decorated
with Russian old army decorations.

The French decorations were probably the sincerest marks of esteem and admiration. They were
bestowed by French officers who were close to the doughboy in the field. And they are prized
as tokens of the affection of the French for Americans.

In speaking of American decorations we can hardly write without heat. The doughboy did not
get his just deserts. And he, without doubt, is correct in placing the blame for the neglect
at the door of the American commanding officer, Colonel Stewart. Men and officers who died
heroically up there in that North Russian campaign, and others who carry wound scars, and yet
others who performed valiantly in that desperate campaign, went unrewarded.

Memorial Day Service In American Military Cemetery In Archangel--Tribute To Our Comrades Who

"At the earliest possible moment" was the date set by the War Department for the withdrawal
of the troops from Russia. This was the promise made the American people during the ice-bound
winter, the promise made more particularly to appease vigorous protests of "The Detroit's Own
Welfare Association," which under the leadership of Mr. D. P. Stafford, had been untiring in
its efforts to move the hand of the War Department. Congressmen Doremus and Nichols and Townsend
had also been very active in "getting the Americans out of North Russia."

To us wearied veterans of that strange war, the nine months of guerrilla war, always strenuous
and at times taking on large proportions,--to us the "earliest possible moment" could not arrive
a minute too soon. We had fought a grim fight against terrible odds, we had toiled to make
the defenses more and more impregnable so that those who relieved us might not be handicapped
as we had been. We hated to be thought of as quitters, we suffered under the reproachful eyes
of newly arriving veteran Scots and Tommies who had been mendaciously deceived into thinking
we were quitters. We suffered from the thought that the distortion, exaggeration and partisan
outcry at home was making use of half-statements of returned comrades or half-statements from
uncensored letters, in such a way as to make us appear cry-babies and quitters. But down in
our hearts we were conscious that our record, our morale, our patriotism were sound. We believed
we were entitled to a speedy getaway for home. We accepted the promise with pleasure. We felt
friendly toward the Detroit's Own Welfare Association for its efforts and the efforts of others.
We could have wished that there had not been so much excitement of needless fears and incitement
of useless outcry. It cost us hard earned money to cable home assurances to our loved ones
that we were well and safe, so that they need not believe the wild tales that we were sleeping
in water forty below zero, or thawing out the cows before we milked them, or simply starving
to death. We could have wished that returned comrades who tried to tell the real facts and
allay needless fears--the actual facts were damnable enough--might not have been treated as
shamefully as some were by a populace fooled by a mixed propaganda that was a strange combination,
as it appears to us now, of earnest, sympathetic attempts to do something for "Detroit's Own,"
of bitter partisan invective, and of insidious pro-bolshevism.

For the cordial welcome home which was given to the Polar Bear veterans in July, our heartfelt
appreciation is due. Veterans who marched behind Major J. Brooks Nichols between solid crowds
of cheering home-folks on July 4th at Belle Isle could not help feeling that the city of Detroit
was proud of the record of the men who had weathered that awful campaign. It was a greeting
that we had not dreamed of those days away up there in the northland when we were watching
the snow and ice melt and waiting news of the approach of troopships.

At Economia we assembled for the purpose of preparing for our voyage home. To the silt-sawdust
island doughboys came from the various fronts. By rail from Obozerskaya and Bolsheozerki, by
barge from Beresnik and Kholmogori and Onega, came the veterans of this late side show of the
great world war. With them they had their mascots and their War Brides, their trophies and
curios, their hopeful good humor and healthy play spirit.

Who will not recall with pleasure the white canvass camp we made on the "policed-up" sawdust
field. Did soldiers ever police quite so willingly as they did there on the improvised baseball
diamond, where "M" Company won the championship and the duffle-bagful of roubles when the first
detachment of the 339th was delousing and turning over Russian equipment, and "F" Company won
the port belt and roubles in the series played while the remainder of the Polar Bears were
getting ready to sail.

Who will forget the day that the Cruiser "Des Moines" steamed in from the Arctic? Every doughboy
on the island rushed to the Dvina's edge. They stood in great silent throat-aching groups,
looking with blurred eyes at the colors that grandly flew to the breeze. And then as the jackies
gave them a cheer those olive drab boys answered till their throats were hoarse. That night
they sat long in their tents--it was not dusk even at midnight, and talked of home. A day or
so later they spied from the fire-house tower vessels that seemed to be jammed in a polar ice
floe which a north wind crowded into the throat of the White Sea. Then to our joy a day or
two later came the three transports, the long deferred hope of a homeward voyage.

Everyone was merry those days. Even the daily practice march with full-pack ordered by Colonel
Stewart, five miles round and round on the rough board walks of the sawdust port, was taken
with good humor. Preparations for departure included arrangements for carrying away our brides
and mascots.

Here and there in the Economia embarkation camp those days and nightless nights in early June
many a secret conclave of doughboys was held to devise ways and means of getting their Russian
mascots aboard ship. Of these boys and youths they had become fond. They wanted to see them
in "civvies" in America and the mascots were anxiously waiting the outcome at the gangplank.

At Chamova one winter night a little twelve-year old Russian boy wandered into the "B" Company
cook's quarters where he was fed and given a blanket to sleep on. Welz, the cook, mothered
him and taught him to open bully cans and speak Amerikanski. This incident had its counterpart
everywhere. At Obozerskaya "M" Company picked up a boy whose father and mother had been carried
off by the Bolsheviks. He and his pony and water-barrel cart became part of the company. At
Pinega the "G" Company boys adopted a former Russian Army youth who for weeks was the only
man who could handle their single Colt machine gun. In trying to get him on board the "Von
Stenben" in Brest--it had been simple in Economia--they got their commanding officer into trouble.
Lt. Birkett was arrested, compelled to remain at Brest but later released and permitted to
bring the youth to America with him where he lives in Wisconsin. And out on a ranch in Wyoming
a Russian boy who unofficially enlisted with the American doughboys to fight for his Archangel
state is now learning to ride the American range with Lt. Smith. Major Donoghue's "little sergeant"
is in America too and goes to school and his Massachusetts school teacher calls him Michael
Donoghue. And others came too.

In marked contrast to these passengers who came with the veterans from North Russia via Brest,
which they remember for its Bokoo Eats and its lightning equipment-exchange mill, is the story
of one of the fifty general prisoners whom they guarded on the "Von Steuben." One of them was
a bad man, since become notorious. He was missing as the ship dropped anchor that night in
the dark harbor. It was feared by the "second looie" and worried old sergeant that the man
was trying to make an escape. When they found him feigning slumber under a life boat on a forbidden
deck they chose opposite sides of the life boat and kicked him fervently, first from one side
then the other till he was submissive. The name of the man at that time meant little to them--it
was Lt. Smith. But a few days afterward they could have kicked themselves for letting Smith
off so easy, for the press was full of the stories of the brutalities of "Hardboiled" Smith.
Lt. Wright and Sergeant Gray are not yearning to do many events of the Russian campaign over
but they would like to have that little event of the homeward bound voyage to do over so they
could give complete justice to "Hardboiled" Smith.

In contrast with the stories of brutal prison camps of the World War we like to think of our
buddies making their best of hardships and trials in North Russia. We have asked two well-known
members of the expedition to contribute reminiscences printed below.

"As ithers see us" is here shown by extract from a letter by a Red Cross man who saw doughboys
as even our Colonel commanding did not see. This Red Cross officer, Major Williams, of Baltimore,
saw doughboys on every front and sector of the far-extended battle and blockhouse line. He
may speak with ample knowledge of conditions. In part he writes:

"Americans, as a rule, are more popular in Russia than any other nationality. The American
soldier in North Russia by his sympathetic treatment of the villagers, his ability to mix and
mingle in a homey fashion with the Russian peasants in their family life and daily toil, and
particularly the American soldier's love of the little Russian children, and the astonishing
affection displayed by Russian children toward the Americans furnishes one of the most illuminating
examples of what was and may be accomplished through measures of peaceful intercourse. The
American soldier demonstrated in North Russia that he is a born mixer.

"I could write a book, giving concrete examples coming under my observation, from voluminous
notes in my possession. As I dictate this, there is a vision of an American soldier who stopped
by my sled, at some remote village in a trackless forest, and urged me to visit with him a
starving family. This soldier, from his own rations, was helping to feed thirteen Russians,
and his joy was as great as theirs when the Red Cross came to their relief."

The next contribution is from the pen of a man who, born in Kiev, Russia, had in youth seen
the Czar's old army, who had served years in the U. S. army after coming to America, who was
one of the finest soldiers and best known men in the North Russian expedition.

"It is almost an axiom with the regular army of our own country and those of foreign nations,
that soldier and discipline are synonymous. Meaning thereby the blind discipline of the Prussian
type.

"That such an axiom is entirely wrong has been shown us by the National Army. No one will affirm
that the new-born army was a model to pass inspection even before our own High Moguls of the
regular army. And yet, what splendid success has that sneered at, 'undisciplined,' army achieved.

"And where is the cause of its success? The 'Uneducatedness' in the sense of the regular army.
The American citizen in a soldier uniform acted like a free human being, possessing initiative,
self-reliance, and confidence, which qualities are entirely subdued by the so called education
of a soldier. It is not the proper salute or clicking of the heels that makes the good soldier,
but the spirit of the man and his character. And these latter qualities has possessed our national
army. Fresh from civilian life with all the liberty-loving tendencies, our boys have thrown
themselves into the fight on their own accord, once they realized the necessity of it. The
whip of discipline could never accomplish so much as the conscience of necessity. And that
is what the national army possessed. And that is the cause of its success. And therefore I love it.

"So long as the United States remains a free country, there is no danger for the American people.
That spirit which has manifested itself in the National Army is capable to accomplish everything.
It is the free institutions of the country that brought us victory, not the so called 'education'
gotten in the barracks.

"I admired the national army man in fight, because I loved him as a citizen. And unless he
changes as a citizen, he will not change as a fighter. To me the citizen and soldier are synonymous.
A good citizen makes a good soldier, and vice versa. Let the American citizen remain as free-loving
and self-reliant as he is now, and he will make one of the best soldiers in the world. Let
him lose that freedom loving spirit, and he will have to be Prussianized.

"I have my greatest respect for the national army man, because I have
seen him at his best. In the moments of gravest danger he has exhibited
that courage which is only inborn in a free man. And when I saw that
courage, I said, He does not need any 'education.' Let him remain a free
man, and God help those who will try to take away his freedom."

From distant Morjagorskaya, hundreds of versts, walked a bright-eyed Slavic village school
teacher to say goodbye to her doughboy friend who was soon to sail for home. But to her great
joy and reward, Nina Rozova found that her lover, George Geren, of Detroit, had found a way
to make her his wife at once. One certain sympathetic American Consul, Mr. Shelby Strother,
had told George he would help him get his bride to America if he wanted to marry the pretty
teacher.

Blessings on that warm-hearted Consul. He helped eight of the boys to bring away their brides.
In this volume is a picture of a doughboy-barishna wedding party, Joe Chinzi and Elena Farizy.
On a boat from Brest to Hoboken, among one hundred sixty-seven war brides from France, Belgium,
England and Russia, Elena was voted third highest in the judges' beauty list. And John Karouch
saw his Russian bride, Alexandra Kadrina, take the first beauty prize. The writer well remembers
the beautiful young Russian woman of Archangel who wore mourning for an American corporal and
went to see her former lover's comrades go away on the tug for the last time. They had been
to the cemetery and they looked respectfully and affectionately at her for they knew it was
her hand that had made the corporal's grave there in the American cemetery in Archangel the
one most marked by evidences of loving care.

One of the last duties of the veterans of this campaign was the paying of honors to their dead
comrades in the American cemetery which Ambassador Francis had purchased for our dead. This
was without doubt the most remarkable Memorial Day service in American history. From The American
Sentinel is taken the following account:

"American Memorial Day was celebrated at Archangel yesterday. Headed by the American Band,
a company of American troops, and detachments of the U. S. Navy, Russian troops, Russian Navy,
British troops, British Navy, French troops, French Navy, Italian and Polish troops, formed
in parade at Sabornaya at ten o'clock in the morning and marched to the cemetery.

"Here a short memorial service was held. Brief addresses were delivered by General Richardson,
General Miller, Charge D'Affaires Poole, and General Ironside.

"In his introductory address General Richardson said:

"'Fellow Soldiers of America and Allied Nations: We are assembled here on the soil of a great
Ally and a traditional friend of our country, to do what honor we may to the memory of America's
dead here buried, who responded to their country's call in the time of her need and have laid
down their lives in her defense. Throughout the world wherever may be found American soldiers
or civilians, are gathered others today for the fulfillment of this sacred and loving duty.
I ask you to permit your thought to dwell at this time with deep reverence upon the fact that
no higher honor can come to a soldier than belongs to those who have made this supreme sacrifice,
and whose bodies lie here before us, but whose spirits, we trust, are with us.'

"Before introducing General Miller, General Richardson thanked the Allied representatives for
their participation in the celebration of Memorial Day.

"Mr. Poole said:

"'This day was first instituted in memory of those who fell in the American Civil War. It became
the custom to place flowers on the graves of soldiers and strew flowers on the water in memory
of the sailor dead, marking in this way one day in each year when the survivors of the war
might join with a later generation to revere the memory of those who had made for the common
good the supreme sacrifice of life. For Americans it is an impressive thought that we are renewing
this consecration today in Russia, in the midst of a civic struggle which recalls the deep
trials of our own past and which is, moreover, inextricably bound up with the World War which
has been our common burden.

"'This war, which was begun to put down imperial aggression upon the political liberties, of
certain peoples, has evolved into a profound social upheaval, touching the most remote countries.
We cannot yet see definitely what the results of its later developments will be, but already
there lies before forward looking men the bright prospect of peace and justice and liberty
throughout the world such as we recently dared hope for only within the narrow confines of
particular countries. To the soldiers of the great war--inspired from the outset by a dim foresight
of this stupendous result--we now pay honor; and in particular, to the dead whose graves are
before us.

"'These men, like their comrades elsewhere in the most endless line of battle, have struck
their blow against the common enemy. They have had the added privilege of assisting in the
most tragic, and at the same time the most hopeful, upheaval for which the war has been the
occasion. Autocracy in Russia is gone. A new democracy is in the struggle of its birth. The
graves before us are tangible evidence of the deep and sympathetic concern of the older democracies.
These men have given their lives to help Russia. They have labored in an enterprise which is
a forecast of a new order in the world's affairs and have made of it a prophecy of success.
Here within this restricted northern area there has been an acid test of the practicability
of co-operation among nations for the attainment of common ends. Nowhere could material and
moral conditions have been more difficult than we have seen them these past months; under no
circumstances could differences in national temperament or the frailties and shortcomings of
individuals be brought into stronger relief. Yet the winter of our initial difficulties is
given way to a summer of maturing success. Co-operation begun in the most haphazard fashion
has developed after a few months of mutual adjustment into concerted and harmonious action.
It seems to me that herein lies striking proof of the generous spirit of modern international
intercourse and proof of the most practical kind that, as nations succeed to doing away with
war, they will be able to apply the energies thus released to common action in the beneficent
field of world wide social and political betterment.  If this ideal is to be measurably attained,
as I believe it is, these men have indeed made their sacrifice to a great cause. They have
given their lives to the progress of civilization and their memory shall be cherished as long
as civilization lasts.'

"The Northern Morning, a Russian daily of Archangel, reported on the Memorial Day Exercises
as follows:

"'In memory of the fallen during the Civil War in America, on the initiative of President Lincoln,
the 30th of May was fixed as a day to remember the fallen heroes. In this year our American
friends have to pass this day far from their country, America, in our cold northland, between
the graves of those who are dear not only to our friends, Allies, but also to us Russians;
the sacred graves beneath which are concealed those who, far from their own country, gave away
their lives to save us. These are now sacred and dear places, and the day of the thirtieth
of May as a day of memorial to them will always be to us a day of mourning. This day will not
be forgotten in the Russian soul. It has to be kept in memory as long as the name of Russian
manhood exists.

"'After the speeches a military salute was fired. A heart-breaking call of the trumpet over
the graves of the fallen sounded the mourning notes. Those who attended the meeting will never
forget this moment of the bugle call. The signal as it broke forth filled the air with sorrowness
and grief, as if it called the whole world to bow before those who, loving their neighbors,
without hesitation gave their lives away for the sacred cause of humanity.'

"Honor be to the fallen: blessings and eternal rest to those protectors of humanity who gave
their lives away for the achievement of justice and right. Sleep quietly now, sons of liberty
and light. You won before the world never-fading honor and eternal glory."

And so at last came the day to sail. We were going out. No Americans were coming to take our
place. We were going to leave the "show" in the hands of the British--who themselves were to
give it up before fall. The derided Bolshevik bands of brigands whom we had set out to chase
to Vologda and Kotlas, had developed into a well-disciplined, well-equipped fighting organization
that responded to the will of Leon Trotsky. Although we had seen an Archangel State military
force also develop behind our lines and come on to the active fighting sectors, we knew that
Archangel was in desperate danger from the Bolshevik Northern Army of Red soldiers. They were
out there just beyond the fringe of the forest only waiting, perhaps, for us to start home.

We must admit that when we thought of those wound-chevroned Scots who had remained on the lines
with the new Archangel troops of uncertain morale and recalled the looks in their eyes, we
sensed a trace of bitter in our cup of joy. Why if the job had been worth doing at all had
it not been worth while for our country to do it wholeheartedly with adequate force and with
determination to see it through to the desired end. We thought of the many officers and men
who had given their lives in this now abandoned cause. And again arose the old question persistent,
demanding an answer: Why had we come at all? Was it just one of those blunders military-political
that are bound to happen in every great war? The thought troubled us even as we embarked for home.

That night scene with the lowering sun near midnight gleaming gold upon the forest-shaded stretches
of the Dvina River and casting its mellow, melancholy light upon the wrecked church of a village,
is an ineffaceable picture of North Russia. For this is our Russia--a church; a little cluster
of log houses, encompassed by unending forests of moaning spruce and pine; low brooding, sorrowful
skies; and over all oppressive stillness, sad, profound, mysterious, yet strangely lovable
to our memory.

Near the shell-gashed and mutilated church are two rows of unadorned wooden crosses, simple
memorials of a soldier burial ground. Come vividly back into the scene the winter funerals
in that yard of our buddies, brave men who, loving life, had been laid away there, having died
soldier-like for a cause they had only dimly understood. And the crosses now rise up, mute,
eloquent testimony to the cost of this strange, inexplicable war of North Russia.

We cast off from the dirty quay and steamed out to sea. On the deck was many a reminiscent
one who looked back bare-headed on the paling shores, in his heart a tribute to those who,
in the battle field's burial spot or in the little Russian churchyards stayed behind while
we departed homeward bound.

This closes our narrative. It is imperfectly told. We could wish we had time to add another
volume of anecdotes and stories of heroic deeds. For errors and omissions we beg the indulgence
of our comrades. We trust that the main facts have been clearly told. Here by way of further
dedication of this book to our honored dead, whose names appear at the head of our lengthy
casualty list of five hundred sixty-three, let us add a few simple verses of sentiment, the
first two of which were written by "Dad" Hillman and the others added on by one of the writers.

THE HONOR ROLL

of the

AMERICAN EXPEDITION WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI IN NORTH RUSSIA

1918-1919

IN RUSSIA's FIELDS (After Flanders Fields)

In Russia's fields no poppies grow There are no crosses row on row To mark the places where
we lie, No larks so gayly singing fly As in the fields of Flanders.

We are the dead. Not long ag'o We fought beside you in the snow And gave our lives, and here
we lie Though scarcely knowing reason why Like those who died in Flanders.

At Ust Padenga where we fell On Railroad, Kodish, shot and shell We faced, from just as fierce
a foe As those who sleep where poppies grow, Our comrades brave in Flanders.

In Toulgas woods we scattered sleep, Chekuevo and Kitsa's tangles creep Across our lonely graves.
At night The doleful screech owl's dismal flight Heart-breaking screams in Russia.

Near railroad bridge at Four-five-eight, And Chamova's woods, our bitter fate We met. We fell
before the Reds Where wolves now howl above our heads In far off lonely Russia.

In Shegovari's desperate fight, Vistavka's siege and Seltso's night, In Bolsheozerki's hemmed-in
wood, In Karpogor, till death we stood Like they who died in Flanders.

And some in Archangel are laid 'Neath rows of crosses Russian-made With marker of the Stars
and Stripes Not minding bugle, drum or pipes We sleep, the brave, in Russia.

And comrades as you gather far away In God's own land on some bright day And think of us who
died and rest Just tell our folks we did our best In far off fields of Russia.
