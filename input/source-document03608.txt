  BUREAU OF STATISTICS, AGRICULTURE AND IMMIGRATION,
            OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, JUNE 1, 1909.

To His Excellency M. E. Hay, Governor of Washington:

We have the honor to transmit herewith the Biennial Report of the Bureau of Statistics, Agriculture
and Immigration for the year 1909, dealing with the various resources and industries of Washington.

This publication represents an effort to place before the general public, and particularly
the visitors at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, a brief description of the principal resources
and industries of the State of Washington.

Its imperfections may be accounted for largely by reason of the fact that funds for the purpose
did not become available until the first day of April of the current year. This necessitated
unusual haste in securing and preparing the material upon which the pamphlet is based. However,
we have endeavored to deal conservatively and fairly with the various subjects under consideration,
and to present all the information possible within the limits of the space at our disposal.

Our purpose has been to supply the reader with an outline of the salient facts which account
for the marvelous growth and development which the commonwealth is enjoying. To go largely
into detail within the scope of a pamphlet of this size would be, manifestly, an impossibility.
We might readily exhaust our available space in dealing with one industry or in describing
a single county. Details, therefore, have been necessarily and purposely avoided.

We have sought to bring the entire state within the perspective of the reader, leaving him
to secure additional facts through personal investigation. Along this line, attention is called
to the list of commercial organizations and local officials presented [Page 4] in the statistical
portion of this report. Nearly all the larger communities of the state maintain organizations,
equipped to supply detailed facts relating to their particular locality. Much valuable information
may be obtained on application to these organizations or to local officials.

An expression of appreciation is due those who have assisted us by supplying information and
collecting photographs for use in this publication. Without such aid the completion of the
pamphlet would have been materially delayed.

[Page 5] GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES OF WASHINGTON.

The State of Washington as now constituted, was, prior to 1853, a portion of the Territory
of Oregon. During the year mentioned, a new territory was carved from the old Oregon boundaries,
which the statesmen of that day evidently believed was marked by destiny for the achievement
of great things, for they conferred upon it the name of Washington.

That our state, thus highly distinguished, has already demonstrated itself worthy of the exalted
name, so happily bestowed upon it, the most carping critic must admit. With a population now
reaching up toward a million and a half, and with all the forces that make for industrial,
commercial and agricultural supremacy in full swing, and gathering new momentum yearly, Washington
is moving onward and upward toward a position among the very elect of our great sisterhood
of states.

As briefly as the story may be told, the fundamental facts which underlie the marvelous advancement
made by the state during recent years will be set forth in the pages of this pamphlet.

NATURAL DIVISIONS OF THE STATE.

By virtue of its varied topography, Washington is naturally divided into a number of districts
or sections, each possessing its own particular characteristics.

Olympic Peninsula.

The first of these districts may be described as consisting of that section of the state including
the Olympic mountains and extending westward from them to the Pacific ocean. Within the limits
of this Olympic peninsula, as it is ordinarily termed, there is standing one of the largest
and most valuable tracts of virgin timber yet remaining in the United States.

[Page 6] Puget Sound Basin.

The second district includes the territory lying between the Olympic and Cascade mountains,
the chief physical feature of which is the great inland sea known as Puget Sound. The shore
front of this important waterway exceeds 2,000 miles, and its length is broken by numerous
bays and harbors, upon which are located Seattle, the state's metropolis, and the growing cities
of Tacoma, Everett, Bellingham and Olympia. The climate of this section is mild in winter and
cool in summer, extremes in either season being practically unknown. Deep sea shipping enters
the port of Puget Sound from every maritime country on the globe, and the industrial and commercial
interests of this section are expanding with extraordinary rapidity.

The Cascade Mountains.

The Cascade mountains constitute the third of these natural divisions. This range extends in
a broken line across the width of the state, at a distance of about 120 miles from the Pacific
ocean. These mountains, their rugged peaks capped with a mantle of eternal snow, their sides
covered with a heavy timber growth, and their valleys carrying numerous sparkling mountain
streams, with illimitable possibilities for the development of power, are one of the important
assets of the state, the value of which has not as yet even been estimated. The mineral wealth
of the Cascades, only a slight knowledge of which has as yet been secured, will ere long contribute
largely to the prosperity of the state, while the more moderate slopes of the mountains serve
a valuable purpose for the pasturage of numerous flocks and herds.

Okanogan Highlands.

The fourth district is known as the Okanogan highlands, and occupies that portion of the state
lying north of the Columbia river and east of the Cascade mountains. This section of the state
contains valuable timber and mineral wealth in addition to presenting many attractive opportunities
to the farmer and horticulturist. It has been hampered thus far by [Page 7] lack of adequate
transportation facilities, and for this reason land may be had at exceptionally reasonable figures.

Columbia River Basin.

The Columbia river basin is by far the largest natural division of the state, and, generally
speaking, includes the section drained by that river and its tributaries. Within the confines
of this district are the great irrigated and grain-growing sections of the state, which are
a source of constantly increasing wealth.

This great "Inland Empire," as it has come to be called, has made thousands of homeseekers
independent, and is largely responsible for the rise to commercial greatness of the splendid
city of Spokane. Other cities of growing importance lying within the Columbia river basin are
Walla Walla, North Yakima, Ellensburg and Wenatchee, while scores of smaller communities are
annually adding to their population with the continued development of the districts of which
they are the immediate distributing centers.

The Southeast.

The Blue mountains form the chief natural characteristic of the extreme southeastern section
of the state, which constitutes the sixth division. This is comparatively a small district,
but one that is highly favored by climatic and soil advantages, and it is well timbered and
watered.

The Southwest.

The southwest is the seventh and final division of the state. It comprises an extensive district,
fronting on the Columbia river and the Pacific ocean. It is heavily wooded and its chief industries
are based upon its timber wealth. The taking and canning of fish and oyster culture are also
important industries, while fruit growing and general farming are carried on upon a constantly
increasing scale.

[Page 8] NATURAL RESOURCES OF WASHINGTON.

Probably few other states in the Union excel Washington in the great variety, abundance and
value of the natural gifts prepared and ripe for the hand of man within its borders. Preceding
races were content to leave its wealth to us, being themselves satisfied to subsist upon that
which was at hand and ready for consumption with no effort but the effort of taking. The impenetrable
forests were to them a barrier to be let alone. For the minerals within the mountains they
had no use, and to gather wealth from the tillage of the soil needed too much exertion. Fish
and game and fruits all ready to gather were all they sought, and the state had enough of these
to attract and hold a large population. But the vision of the white man was different. His
eye scanned the peaks of the Cascades with its great eternal white Rainier having its head
thrust up among the clouds, and he realized that around and beneath them must be a vast hoard
of the precious metals. His eye caught the dazzling grandeur of the white-capped Olympics,
but he realized that they held in reserve something more substantial to his needs than scenery
and hunting grounds. The impenetrable barriers of the forest-covered foothills were to him
a treasure worth the struggle for an empire. He scanned the glittering waters of the bays and
inlets of Puget Sound and its great open way to the Pacific Ocean and realized that it meant
more to him and to his children than a place to catch a few fish. He viewed the vast plains
of "barren" land within the great winding course of the Columbia river and believed it worth
more than pasturage for a few bands of ponies.

The thousand tumbling water-falls that hastened the course of the rivers toward the sea meant
more than resting places for the chase. No wonder the hardy pioneers whose vision saw the grandeur
of Washington and comprehended its meaning dared a mighty journey, vast hardships and trying
and dangerous hazards to save this empire to Uncle Sam. Washington, saved by the energy and
foresight of a few, has become the [Page 9] delightful home of a million and more, and their
possession is one that Alexander or Napoleon would have coveted, had they known.

FORESTS.

From British Columbia to the majestic Columbia river and from the Cascade mountains westward
to the ocean a vast forest of magnificent timber stretches out over mountain and hill and valley,
covering the whole landscape of western Washington in a mantle of living green. The majestic
fir trees, which, as small evergreens, adorn the lawns of other climes, here stretch their
ancient heads 300 feet heavenward and give the logger a chance to stand upon his springboard
and, leaving a fifteen foot stump, cut off a log 100 feet in length and 7 feet in diameter
free from limbs or knots. Side by side with these giants of fir are other giants of cedar,
hemlock and spruce crowded in groups, sometimes all alike and sometimes promiscuously mingled,
which offer to the logger often 50,000 feet of lumber from an acre of ground.

But these great forests of western Washington are not all the forests within the state. The
eastern slope of the Cascade mountains well down toward the lands of the valleys is mostly
covered with timber. A belt from 30 to 50 miles wide stretching clear across the north boundary
of eastern Washington is mostly a forest, while a large area in the southeastern corner of
the state, probably 24 miles square, is also forest covered.

To estimate the amount of timber which can be cut from these vast forest areas is difficult;
estimates are not accurate, yet it is probable that the lumber made will in time far exceed
any estimate yet placed upon this chief source of the wealth of the State of Washington. Of
the fir the estimate has been made that shows still standing enough timber to make 120 billion
feet; for the cedar the estimate is 25 billion feet, while the same amount of 25 billion feet
is credited to hemlock; 12 billion feet of spruce are claimed, 12 billion feet of yellow pine
and probably 6 billion feet of other woods, including maple, alder, oak, yew, ash and many
others, together forming the great mass of 200 billion feet of lumber. Where forest areas are
cut off, the [Page 10] sun and air at once start to life seeds which lie dormant in the shade
and a new crop at once starts and the old ground is in a few years reforested in nature's prodigal
way, a thousand seeds sprouting and growing where only one giant can ultimately stand.

Of these timbers, the fir, largest in quantity, is also largest in usefulness. For bridge work,
shipbuilding, the construction of houses, etc. it is unsurpassed. Cedar is lighter and more
easily worked and for shingles chiefly and many other special uses is superior. Spruce is fine
grained, odorless and valuable for butter tubs, interior finish, shelving, etc. The hemlock
is valuable not only for the tannin of its bark, but as a wood for many purposes is equal to
spruce. The yellow pine, where it is plentiful is the main wood used in house construction
and for nearly all farm purposes. The yellow pine is the chief timber in all eastern Washington.
The harder woods, maple, alder, ash, etc., are used where available in furniture construction
and for fuel, as are also all the other woods.

COAL.

Not content with covering half the surface of the state with forests for fuel, the Creator
hid away under the forests an additional supply of heat and power sufficient to last its future
citizens an indefinite period. The white man was not slow to find and locate the coal measures
in many counties, notably in Kittitas, King, Pierce, Lewis, Whatcom and Thurston, and to put
it to the task of driving his machinery. The coal measures of these counties are of vast extent,
and, although little developed yet, there are 3,000,000 tons of coal mined annually in Washington.
Other counties are known to have coal measures beneath their forests, but as yet they have
not been opened up for commerce.

The coal already mined includes both lignite and bituminous varieties and furnishes fuel for
the railroads, steamboats and power plants, giving very satisfactory results. Much of the bituminous
coal makes an excellent article of coke and provides this concentrated carbon for the various
plants about the state engaged in smelting iron and other metals.

[Page 11] The fixed carbon of the coal ranges from 48 to 65 per cent. and the total values
in carbon from 64 to 80 per cent. and the ash from 3 to 17 per cent. The coal measures underlie
probably the great bulk of the foothills on both sides of the Cascades and some of the Olympics,
the Blue mountains of the southeast and some of the low mountains in the northeastern part
of the state.

Besides these coals already mentioned, it is known that veins of anthracite coal exist in the
western part of Lewis county, the extent and value of which have not been fully determined,
and, owing to the absence of transportation, are not on the market.

MINERAL ORES.

The general topography of the state suggests at once the probability of deposits of ores of
the precious metals, and the cursory prospecting already done justifies the outlook. Practically
the entire mountain regions are enticing fields for the prospector. Substantial rewards have
already been realized by many who have chanced the hardships, and there are now in operation
many mining enterprises which are yearly adding a substantial sum to the output of the wealth
of the state. The ores occur chiefly in veins of low grade and great width and known as base
on account of the presence of sulphur, arsenic and other elements compelling the ores to be
roasted before smelting.

There are, however, some high grade ores in narrow fissures and in a few localities free milling
ores and placer deposits are found. In most cases the free milling ores are the result of oxidation
and will be found to be base as water level is reached in the mining process.

Mining of precious metals is being prosecuted in Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, King, Pierce,
Lewis, Skamania, Cowlitz, Okanogan, Chelan, Kittitas, Yakima, Klickitat, Ferry and Stevens
counties.

Of the metals the mines of the state are producing gold, silver, lead, copper, quicksilver,
zinc, arsenic, antimony, molybdenum, [Page 12] nickel, cobalt, tungsten, titanium, bismuth,
sulphur, selenium, tellurium, tin and platinum.

There are also iron mines, and quarries of marble, granite, onyx, serpentine, limestone and
sandstone--beds of fire clay, kaolin, fire and potter's clays, talc and asbestos and many prospects
of petroleum.

Mining is suffering for the lack of transportation for the low grade ores, but prospects are
excellent for relief in this regard in the near future. The era of wildcat exploitation has
been relegated to the past and legitimate mining is now getting a firmer hold in the state,
and we look for results within the next five years which will astonish many who think themselves
well informed.

FISHERIES.

A glance at the map of the state will disclose a remarkable combination of salt and fresh waters
within the jurisdiction of the state of such a character as to amaze one not familiar with
it, but learned in the habits of the finny tribe in general.

The ocean is the great feeding ground. Out of its mysterious depths the millions of fish come
into fresh waters fat and rich from the salt water vegetation.

The great Columbia river in the south, Willapa harbor, Grays harbor, the majestic straits of
Fuca and the equally majestic straits of Georgia on the north are all great open highways from
the sea, not only for merchandise laden ships, but for myriads of salt water food fishes which
annually traverse their bottoms. Into these open mouths flows a great network of fresh water
rivers and streams, draining the entire area of the state and providing the spawning waters
for the fishes from the sea not only, but for millions of strictly fresh water fishes. Not
only these, but late years have proven the shore waters of the state to produce also great
numbers of oysters, clams, crabs and shrimp. Nor is this all, because the proximity of the
state to the ocean gives it a great advantage in profiting from the fishing industry among
that class of the finny hosts who refuse to leave their salt water homes. So that from the
whales of Bering sea to the speckled beauties that haunt the mountain [Page 13] streams, through
the long list of delectable salt and fresh water food, the fisherman of Washington has an enticing
and most profitable chance to satisfy his love of sport and adventure not only, but to increase
his bank account as well.

SOILS AND LANDS.

Washington is particularly blessed in having a diversity of soils, all admirably adapted to
some department of agriculture and giving the state the opportunity of great diversity in the
occupations of its people. The central plateau of eastern Washington, made up of level stretches
and undulating hills, is all covered with a soil composed of volcanic ash and the disintegration
of basaltic rocks which, together with some humus from decayed vegetation, has made a field
of surpassing fertility for the production of the cereals with scant water supply; but under
the magic touch of irrigation it doubles its output and makes of it not only a grain field
but an orchard and garden as well. Underneath the forests of eastern Washington, along the
northern border of the state and in its southeastern corner there is added a large proportion
of clay, a necessary element for perpetual pasturage, and widening the field for fruit growing.

In western Washington, upon the bench lands and on the hills and foothills the forests are
supported upon a gravelly soil, intermixed with a peculiar shot clay which disintegrates with
successive tillage so that when the forests are removed the soil becomes ready for all the
grasses and grains and fruits. In the valleys more silt and humus make up the soil, and when
the cottonwoods, alders and maples are gone there is left a soil deep and strong for the truck
gardener and general farmer, which will endure successive tillings for ages. At the deltas
of the rivers are large reaches of level lands, some of which have to be diked to prevent the
overflow of the tides, which have had added the fertility of the salts of the ocean and are
probably the richest lands in the state fit for cereals and root crops, not omitting the bulbs
which have made the deltas of Holland famous. There are also extensive peat beds which, scientifically
[Page 14] fertilized, will produce abundant returns to the intelligent farmer.

LANDS.

The lands of the state are owned, some by Indian tribes, some by the general government, some
by the state, but largely by individual citizens and corporations.

Indian Lands.

Of the Indian lands most of them have been "allotted" and the balance will soon be thrown open
to settlement. Of these the largest in western Washington are the Quinault and Makah reservations
and in eastern Washington the great Colville reservation. This latter will in time make two
or three counties of great value, being adapted to general farming, dairying, fruit growing
and mining, and having an abundance of forest area for fuel and building purposes. Those in
western Washington are timbered areas at present.

Government Lands.

The remnant of government lands are chiefly among the more barren areas of eastern Washington
and the poorer forest lands of western Washington. The method of obtaining title to government
lands is generally known, and if not, can be obtained from the general land offices, one of
which is in Seattle, Olympia, Vancouver, Spokane, Waterville, Walla Walla and North Yakima.
The government still holds title to nearly six million acres, and, while the best has been
acquired by others, the diligent searcher can still find homesteads and desert claims worth
energy and considerable expense to secure.

State Lands.

A recent estimate of the value of the state lands still in possession makes them worth 56 million
dollars. They include nearly 3,000,000 acres, a large portion of which is heavily timbered.
These lands may be obtained from the state through the state land commissioner by purchase
outright on very easy terms, or may be leased for a term of five to ten years at a low rental,
the lessee receiving virtually a first right to purchase.

These state lands are as good as any in the state and offer to the homeseeker a splendid opportunity
for a start.

[Page 15] In this state there are also numerous tide lands, oyster lands, and shore lands to
be obtained at various prices, both from the state and from private individuals who have already
acquired title from the state.

WATER POWER.

It is probable that no state in the Union is better equipped for creating power than the State
of Washington. Numerous waterfalls of magnitude are already successfully utilized. Among these
the most noted are the Spokane falls, capable of producing 400,000 horse power; the Snoqualmie
falls, with a sheer descent of 250 feet, with a capacity of 100,000 horse power; Puyallup river
at one place is furnishing about 20,000 horse power; the Cedar river has a capacity of 50,000
horse wer; the Nooksack falls with 15,000 horse power already generated; Tumwater falls with
4,000 horse power, with Chelan falls, the Meyers falls and the falls of Asotin creek all in
use to limited extent. The waters of the Yakima river are also in use in part for power purposes,
but more extensively for irrigation. Besides these there are many minor streams already harnessed.

But the unused water powers of the state far exceed that portion now developed. All its streams
are mountain streams, excepting perhaps, the Snake and Columbia rivers. These mountain rivers
in a flow of 50 to 200 miles make a descent of 2,000 to 5,000 feet in reaching sea level, providing
innumerable opportunities to use the falls already created by nature, or to divert the waters
and produce artificial falls.

No heritage of the state is of greater value and none more appreciated than this water power.
Since the introduction of electricity as a lighting and motive force, its creation by water
power looms into immense importance. The exhibition of its achievements to be seen in Washington
today is amazing to the men whose vision of light and power was first with the tallow dip and
four-footed beasts, and later with kerosene and steam. Electricity, created by our water falls,
lights our cities and farm homes, draws our street cars and some railroad cars--pushes most
of the machinery used in manufactories, to the great satisfaction and profit of our citizens.

[Page 16] GAME.

The State of Washington was once a paradise for the sportsman in its every corner. Its desert
lands were full of jack rabbits and sage hens; over its mountains and foothills roamed herds
of elk, mountain goats, deer, and many bear, cougar and wild cats. In its timbered valleys
were pheasants and grouse in plenty. Upon its waters and sloughs the wild ducks and geese were
in vast flocks, while its waters teemed with salmon in many varieties, and several families
of the cod tribe, sole, flounders, perch, mountain trout and other fish.

While these conditions cannot now be said to exist in full, yet at certain seasons, and in
some places, the same game, animals, birds and fishes are in abundance, and the sportsman,
while he may not have his "fill," may satisfy a reasonable amount of his craving for the excitement
of the frontier. The state has deemed it wise to restrict the time and place within which its
game can be taken and the amount a single individual shall kill. These regulations suffice
partly to preserve the game from extinction and help replenish the state's treasury, and are
considered wise and reasonable.

SCENERY.

If Washington is mighty in forest possession, provided with fuel for centuries in its coal
beds, rich in precious metals, with great open waterways full of fish roads from the ocean
and millions of fishes in its inland waters, with game upon its thousand hills and its vast
plains loaded with waving grains and red with luscious fruits, still its crowning glory is
its matchless scenery.

Towering above the clouds, with its head crowned with eternal snows, its sides forever glistening
with icy glaciers till their feet touch the green tops of its foothills, near the center of
the state, stands in imposing grandeur the highest mountain of the states--grand, old Mount
Rainier.

Through its center north and south the Cascade mountains in a zigzag course lift their clustered
peaks and mountain passes from four to eight thousand feet above the sea, while Mount Olympus
and his colleagues higher still poke their inspiring [Page 17] front heavenward. Between these
two white and green clad mountain ranges, protected from the blizzards of the southwestern
plains and from the hurricanes from the ocean, lie in safety the placid waters of Washington's
great inland sea, matchless Puget Sound.

Where else upon the globe is such a diversified stretch of tranquil water, upon whose shores
the ocean tides ebb and flow, upon whose surface the navies of the world could maneuver to
their heart's content, while visible from shore to shore are the vast evergreen forests, interlaced
with winding waters and stretching gently upwards till they reach the visible mountain peaks
a hundred miles away, thousands of feet skyward?

Scarcely less enchanting is the view eastward from the Rainier's lofty height--a vast stretch
of hill and plain almost surrounded by green mountain sides, through whose gray and green fields
flow the great winding courses of the mighty Columbia and the lazy Snake rivers, while a multitude
of smaller streams gleam through the forest sides of the mountains over innumerable waterfalls.
Here within the foothills you gaze upon the largest lake within the state, a beauty spot to
enchant alike the artist and the sportsman. Deep within its rocky sides and full of speckled
beauties lying like a mirror in the stretch of green hills about it, lies Lake Chelan, and
on its unruffled bosom a fleet of boats ply for fifty miles beyond its outlet till reach the
mining foothills of the mountains. A hundred miles eastward, still among the scattered pines
of northeastern Washington, the Spokane river tumbles in masses of foam and spray over a succession
of rocky falls on its way to the Columbia, while still further on the Pend d'Oreille and upper
reaches of the Columbia river flow close up among the mountains and foothills and present a
series of beautiful combinations of rock, trees, hills and valleys, of forests and waterfalls
of magnificent beauty. Washington in its scenery is magnificent in proportions, wonderful in
its variety, grand and imposing in form and feature--picturesque--enticing--"a thing of beauty
and a joy forever."

[Page 18] PRINCIPAL INDUSTRIES OF WASHINGTON.

LUMBERING.

The description of the resources of a state naturally suggests what its industries are. The
forests of western Washington inevitably lead to the lumber industry and the fertile soil of
eastern Washington point as unerringly to agriculture. These are the two great industries of
the state. The lumberman and the farmer are in the majority. Already there are sawmills enough
in operation to cut up all the standing timber in the state within fifty years. They employ
probably 100,000 men. This includes those engaged in logging and the subsidiary industries.

Of the trees the fir is pre-eminently useful, and more than half of the forests of the state
are fir trees. It is of greater strength than any of the others and hence is used for all structural
work where strength is of special importance. It is rather coarse grained, but when quarter
sawed produces a great variety of grains very beautiful and capable of high finish and is extensively
used for inside finishings for houses as well as for frame work. Its strength makes it ideal
for the construction of ships. The yellow pine is strong, medium grained and well fitted for
general building purposes, and is very extensively used in eastern Washington.

Cedar is very light and close grained and is chiefly used for shingles, and for this purpose
has no superior. The cheaper grades are also used for boxes and sheathing for houses and many
other purposes.

The spruce furnishes an odorless wood especially useful for butter tubs; for shelving and similar
uses it is superior to either the fir or cedar. It is a white, close grained lumber, and appreciating
in value.

The hemlock, whose bark produces tannin for the tanneries, is also a close grained light wood
coming more and more into [Page 19] general use, for many purposes, especially where it will
not be exposed to the weather.

Logs frequently seven feet in diameter require big saws, and big carriers 50 to 100 feet long,
and hence Washington has probably the largest sawmills in the world.

Our lumber is used at home and shipped all over the world to make bridges, ships, houses, floors,
sash, doors, boxes, barrels, tubs, etc. Factories for the manufacture of wood products are
scattered all over the state. Most of the sawmills and some factories are driven by steam made
by burning sawdust, slabs, and other refuse of the mills. Coal and electricity, however, are
both in use.

COAL MINING.

The mining of coal for foreign and domestic purposes is one of the most important of Washington's
industries. The annual output of the mines is about three million tons, worth about eight million
dollars; Fifty thousand tons of coke are made annually, worth at the ovens about $300,000.
The coal mining industry gives employment to 6,000 men. The production of coal for 1907 was
distributed as follows:

  Kittitas County, tons  1,524,421
  King County, tons      1,446,966
  Pierce County, tons      612,539
  Lewis County, tons       101,275
  Thurston County, tons     33,772
  Whatcom County, tons       3,160
  Clallam County, tons         300

The coke nearly all comes from Pierce county.

Nearly forty different corporations and individuals are engaged in coal mining. The coals thus
far commercially mined are chiefly lignite and bituminous. These coal measures lie along the
base of the foothills, chiefly of the Cascade mountains. Higher up are some mines of anthracite
coals, not yet on the market for lack of transportation. As far as discovered they are chiefly
near the headwaters of the Cowlitz river in Lewis county. Coal forms the largest factory in
furnishing steam for the mill roads. Some of the railroads, notably the [Page 20] Northern
Pacific and Great Northern, own their own mines and mine the coal for their own engines and shops.

It is also the main fuel supply for domestic uses, although fir and yellow pine cordwood is
extensively used when the cost of transportation is not too great.

Coal is also the chief fuel used in steamboats, both those plying over inland waters and the
ocean-going boats as well. Here also, however, the fir wood proves a good substitute and is
used to some extent by local steamers on the Sound.

Coal is also used to create both steam and electricity for most of the large heating plants
in the cities and in many factories and manufacturing plants, flour mills, elevators, etc.
The fact that vast coal measures lie within 50 miles of the seaports of Puget Sound is a very
important factor in insuring the construction of manufacturing establishments and the concentration
of transportation in these ports.

Coal is also used in all the large cities for the manufacture of illuminating gas and as a
by-product of this industry coke, coal tar, and crude creosote are produced.

The coke from the ovens goes chiefly to the smelters for the reduction of ores, both of the
precious metals and iron.

METAL MINING.

The mining industry other than coal is quite rapidly reaching importance among our industries.
There are in the state three large smelters, whose annual output of precious metals far surpasses
in value the output of our coal mines. The ores for these values, however, do not all come
from the mines of this state. Other states, British Columbia, Alaska, and some foreign countries
help furnish the ores. But Washington has within its borders a great mineralized territory,
not yet thoroughly prospected and very little developed, yet which materially assists in supplying
these smelters with their ores.

The smelter at Everett receives a steady supply of arsenical ores of copper, lead, gold, silver
and zinc from the mines of Snohomish county which are of magnitude sufficient to make profitable
the railroad which has been built to Monte Cristo [Page 21] purposely for these ores. This
smelter has a special plant for saving the arsenic in these ores, which materially adds to
the value of its output and is said to be the only one of its kind in the nation.

Besides the mines at Monte Cristo, there are copper mines being successfully worked at Index,
whose ores are shipped both to Everett and Tacoma.

At Tacoma is located one of the largest smelting and refining plants in the nation, which draws
its ores from all parts of the world. At North Port in Stevens county is a smelter which is
chiefly supplied with ores from this state, supplemented by those of British Columbia. At Republic
in Ferry county are mines producing gold and silver ores of such extent as to have induced
the building of a branch line of railroad to carry their ores to this smelter. There are also
in Stevens county large deposits of silver-lead ores, which will be large producers as soon
as better transportation is secured. This last statement is also true regarding many mines
in other counties.

FISHING INDUSTRY.

The business of catching, preserving and selling fish gives employment probably to more than
10,000 men in this state and adds probably four million dollars annually to its wealth production.
The fishes include salmon, which is the chief commercial species, cod in many varieties, halibut,
salmon trout, perch, sole, flounders, smelt, herring, sardines, oysters, clams, crabs and shrimp
from its salt waters, and sturgeon, trout, perch, black bass, white fish and many others from
the fresh water. Great quantities of salmon and halibut are shipped in ice-packed boxes, fresh
from the waters, to all parts of the nation. Of these fish, many salmon, halibut and cod are
caught in Alaskan waters and brought into this state to be cured and prepared for the market.

The salmon are chiefly packed in tin cans after being cooked; the cod are handled as are the
eastern cod, dried and salted. The business of handling the smelts, herring, etc., is in its
infancy, as is also that of the shellfish.

[Page 22] The propagation of oysters, both native and eastern, is assuming great importance
in many places in the state. In Shoalwater bay, Willipa bay, Grays harbor, and many of the
bays and inlets of Puget Sound, oysters are being successfully grown. In some instances oyster
farms are paying as much as $1,000 per acre. The state has sold many thousand acres of submerged
lands for this purpose. It has also reserved several thousand acres of natural oyster beds,
from which the seed oysters are annually sold at a cheap price to the oyster farmers, who plant
them upon their own lands and market them when full grown.

The native oysters are much smaller than the eastern oysters and of a distinct flavor, but
command the same prices in the market.

AGRICULTURE.

Cereals.

The largest and most important industry in the state is without doubt the cultivation of the
soil. The great variety of the soils and climatic conditions has made the state, in different
parts, admirably adapted to a large variety of farm products. Vast fields of wheat cover a
large proportion of the uplands of eastern Washington, the average yield of which is greater
than that of any other state in the Union.

The diked lands of western Washington produce oats at the rate of 100 to 125 bushels per acre.
In some counties in southeastern Washington barley is more profitable than any other cereal,
on account of the large yield and superior quality.

Corn is successfully raised in some of the irrigated lands, but is not as profitable as some
other crops and hence is not an important factor in Washington's grain supply. Rye, buckwheat,
and flax, are successfully grown in many localities. In western Washington, particularly, peas
form an important ration for stock food and are extensively raised for seed, excelling in quality
the peas of most other states.

[Page 23] Hops.

Hops are a large staple product in many counties of the state. They are of excellent quality,
and the yield is large and their cultivation generally profitable. The chief drawback is in
the fluctuations of the market price.

Grass and Hay.

Grass here, as elsewhere, is very little talked about, although it is one of the large elements
that make the profits of agriculture. Saying nothing of the vast amount of grass consumed green,
the state probably produces a million tons of hay annually, averaging $10 per ton in value.
Western Washington is evergreen in pasturage as well as forests and no spot in the Union can
excel it for annual grass production.

East of the mountains a very large acreage is in alfalfa, with a yield exceeding six tons per acre.

Potatoes.

On the alluvial soils of western Washington and the irrigated lands of the eastern valleys,
potatoes yield exceedingly heavy crops of fine tubers, often from 400 to 600 bushels per acre.
All other root crops are produced in abundance.

Beets.

Extensive experiments have proved that the sugar beet can be raised profitably in many counties
and sugar is now on the markets of the state, made within its borders from home-grown beets.

Truck Gardening.

Garden stuff is supplied to all the large cities chiefly from surrounding lands in proper seasons,
but much is imported from southern localities to supply the market out of season. The soils
utilized for this purpose are the low alluvial valley lands and irrigated volcanic ash lands.
The yield from both is astonishing to people from the eastern prairie states, and even in western
Washington, with its humid atmosphere and cool nights, tomatoes, squashes and sweet corn are
being generously furnished the city markets. The warm irrigated lands of eastern [Page 24]
Washington produce abundant crops of melons, cucumbers, squashes and all other vegetables.

HORTICULTURE.

The conditions for successful fruit growing are abundant, and peculiarly adapted to produce
excellence in quality and quantity in nearly all parts of the state, but some localities have
better conditions for some particular fruits than others, e. g., western Washington excels
in the raising of raspberries and other small fruits of that sort, its climate and soils being
suited to the production of large berries and heavy yields.

Certain localities in eastern Washington excel in the yield of orchard fruits, chiefly on irrigated
lands. Owing to the abundant sunshine, the fruits of eastern Washington are more highly colored
than those of other sections of the state.

Taking the state as a whole, horticulture is rapidly assuming vast importance. Thousands of
acres are yearly being added to the area of orchards, and remarkable cash returns are being
realized from the older plantings now in full bearing.

This is true of all the common orchard fruits, apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries, etc.

In western Washington large plantings of the small fruits are growing in favor, some of the
new fruits receiving especial attention. One plantation of thirty acres is devoted exclusively
to Burbank's phenomenal berry.

Grapes are being grown on both sides of the mountains, the eastern side, however, giving this
fruit much more attention. Cranberries are being produced in quantities on some of the bog
lands near the sea coast.

Nuts have been planted on both sides of the mountains in an experimental way, and it has been
found that walnuts, chestnuts, and filberts are profitable. In the southeastern section of
the state, nut growing bids fair to develop into a considerable industry.

STOCK RAISING.

The glory once enjoyed by this industry is rapidly changing color. Formerly, a predominating
feature of the state was its [Page 25] big herds feeding gratuitously on government lands.
This condition still exists to an extent, the forests being utilized, under regulations by
the government, but the herds are limited.

Individual farms and small herds are now the order of the day and, incidentally, better breeds
are developing. This is true of horses, cattle and sheep. The demand for horses is chiefly
for the heavy draft animals for use in the logging camps and on the streets of the cities,
and the demand is fairly well supplied, chiefly in eastern Washington.

Good cows and fat steers are always in demand, and Washington's market for them is not fully
supplied from the home farms. The same is true regarding sheep and hogs. The phenomenal growth
of the seaport towns on Puget Sound and the difficulty in clearing the lands in western Washington
combine to make the consumption exceed the home grown supply, and many are imported from neighboring
states.

There is abundant room for expansion in stock raising in the state. Conditions are admirable.
Grass is abundant for pasturage, hay is a prolific crop, the climate is mild, no pests afflict
the cattle, and the markets are at the door and always hungry.

THE DAIRY.

There are few states in the Union equal to Washington in its possession of natural conditions
suited to make dairying profitable. In all of western Washington, in the western part of eastern
Washington, and in both the northeastern and southeastern sections of the state, the climate
and soil conspire to make ideal grazing. Particularly is this true in the western part of the
state. All the grasses grow in luxuriance, and with proper care and forethought there may be
secured almost twelve months of green feed annually. The crops best adapted for use as ensilage
grow well, making large yields. Timothy, clover hay and alfalfa are the standbys for winter
feed so far as the coarse feed is concerned, and while mill stuffs and all grains are high
in price, so are correspondingly the products of the dairy. Butter ranges from 25 cents to
40 cents per pound, and milk sells in the coast cities for 10 cents per quart.

[Page 26] POULTRY.

Perhaps no part of agriculture is more profitable to the wise farmer than his barnyard fowls,
and in Washington this is exceptionally true. Eggs retail in the coast towns at 25 cents to
60 cents per dozen. Turkeys at Thanksgiving time are worth from 25 cents to 30 cents per pound
dressed, and other fowl in proportion. Conditions can be made as ideal for poultry raising
in this state as anywhere, and with the market never satisfied, the poultry raiser has every
essential to success in his favor.

BEE CULTURE.

Bee culture among the orchards and alfalfa fields of eastern Washington is a side line which
should not be neglected by the farmer or horticulturist. Many are fully alert to the favorable
conditions, and Washington honey is on sale in the late summer in most of the cities and towns
until the supply is exhausted, and then that from other states comes in to meet the demand.

Pasturage for bees is also abundant in many parts of the western half of the state, and many
a rancher among the forest trees has upon his table the products of his own apiary.

MANUFACTURING OTHER THAN LUMBER.

The State of Washington has natural products either within its own borders or nearby, to foster
many manufacturing industries, besides those having lumber for their raw material.

In the Puget Sound basin are vast deposits of lime rock, which is manufactured into commercial
lime, supplying the home market not only, but is being shipped also to foreign ports. These
are chiefly on San Juan island.

Considerable granite of fine quality is used in building and cemetery structures, from quarries
in Snohomish and Skagit counties. Sandstone is being used for building purposes and is of splendid
texture. Onyx of great variety and beauty is extensively quarried in Stevens county. Marble
of good quality is being sawed up to limited extent. Quarries in southeastern Alaska furnish
rather a better quality and are more extensively worked.

[Page 27] Clays of great variety, including fire clays and those suitable for terra cotta,
are abundant, and large factories in King county are turning out common and pressed brick of
many colors and fine finish, vitrified brick for street paving, terra cotta, stoneware, drain
tile, sewer pipe and other kindred products.

At Concrete, a town of 1,200 people in Skagit county, two factories, employing 500 men, are
daily turning out 1,400 barrels of Portland cement of fine quality, which is finding ready
market in all the large cities.

At Irondale, in Jefferson county, a large plant has been in operation turning out pig iron.
It is now in process of being turned into a steel plant and within a few months will be turning
out steel bars and pipes for sewer, gas and other purposes. The ores are obtained from Whatcom
and Skagit counties, some bog iron in the immediate vicinity and additional ores from Vancouver
island. More than a half million dollars has already been invested and this will probably reach
a full million when the plant is in complete operation. Although iron ores are present in the
state in large quantities, no other serious effort is being made to supply the state with home
made pig iron or its products. Here is a vast field awaiting brains and capital. The above
represent only a few of the many lines of manufacturing that have been successfully developed
in Washington.

TRANSPORTATION.

Commerce and transportation are two affinities, ever seeking each other. They have found on
Puget Sound an ideal trysting place. Here the ships of the ocean reach immense placid waters,
not duplicated on either side of the continent, and for this reason the railroads have come
from the interior to meet them. From foreign ports all over the world ocean carriers are bringing
in great loads of merchandise and passengers, and the railroads coming from the Atlantic coast
across the entire continent bring like loads of merchandise and human freight, and here they
are exchanged. Teas from China and Japan for cotton from Galveston and cotton goods from Massachusetts;
[Page 28] rice and silk, hemp, matting, tin, copper and Japanese bric-a-brac are exchanged
for grain, flour, fish, lumber, fruit, iron and steel ware, paper, tobacco, etc. Merchandise
of all sorts from Asia, the Philippines, South America and Australia is here exchanged for
different stuffs raised or made in every part of the American continent and some from Europe.
This commerce, however, is in its infancy. The Northern Pacific and Great Northern railways
have fattened on it for years. All their rivals have looked on with envious eyes till now a
mad rush is on among them all for vantage ground. The Milwaukee, Canadian Pacific and Burlington
systems already run their trains here, while the Union Pacific and others are rushing for terminals
on Puget Sound tide water. And while thus racing for the great long haul prizes, they are incidentally
giving to the state a complete system of transportation in all its parts and for all its multitudinous
productions.

Of almost equal importance to the state is its great fleet of local steamers which ply its
inland waters, and the numerous electric lines that are rapidly uniting its cities and villages
and giving a new and cheap method of migration. From the city of Spokane and radiating in every
direction, electric lines are in operation and more are in course of construction, bringing
the most distant points of the great "Inland Empire" into close touch with its metropolis and
great distributing center. On the west side the same thing is true, only in less degree. Between
these two groups of transportation facilities, and the commerce which the union of rail and
tidewater has created, the citizens of Washington have found innumerable opportunities of employment.

These opportunities are increasing and broadening every year with the continued development
of the state and in multiplied and varied form they await the newcomer who possesses the ability
to rise to the demands of the situation.

[Page 29] OPPORTUNITIES IN WASHINGTON.

Washington is a land of widely diverging natural conditions. Its topographical characteristics
vary from the low southern exposures of the inland river valleys, where strawberries mature
as early as April, to the mountain summits of the Cascades and Olympics, where winter reigns
supreme the year round. Between these extremes may be found every range of climate known to
the semi-tropical and temperate zones.

For the Homeseeker.

Our lands include those suitable for the successful raising both of the more tender, as well
as the hardier fruits. Every grain, other than corn, yields splendid results, while the truck
gardener, small fruit grower, dairyman, stock raiser and, in fact, every man who aims to secure
a living and a competence from some form of farm industry will find, if he looks for it, a
spot within the confines of this state that will meet his most exacting requirements.

To insure success in any of the above lines requires pluck, energy, stick-to-it-iveness, a
determination to secure desired results, and some capital. But given these, the man who is
looking to Washington as a favored location for the establishment of his household gods need
have no fear of the outcome.

Land may be secured suitable for any of the different purposes mentioned, and with proper care
it may be made to yield beyond the most sanguine expectations. A market is ready and waiting
to absorb every class of product at profitable prices. Transportation facilities are already
excellent and the millions now being expended in new railway construction through the state
give some idea of what the future holds forth in this particular.

[Page 30] For the Business Man.

To the business man a new state, developing as is the State of Washington, naturally offers
numerous and attractive opportunities. New communities are springing up along the lines of
the Milwaukee, the Portland & Seattle, and other railways now in process of construction, each
demanding its quota of commercial enterprises, while the older cities and towns are continually
absorbing new additions to their population, thus paving the way for new business facilities.

For the Investor.

The investor will find an attractive field of action in Washington, and with the exercise of
caution and prudence may anticipate far better returns than he has been accustomed to, without
undue risk of the impairment of his capital. Raw lands, timber lands, improved farms, irrigated
lands and city and town property are exhibiting a steady increase in value and undoubtedly
will continue to do so for years to come. The capitalist may take his choice of any of these
forms of investment, or he may turn to private, industrial or municipal securities which are
constantly being offered on excellent terms and based upon unimpeachable assets.

For the Manufacturer.

To the manufacturer this state offers all the conditions that may be classed as prerequisite
to success. Cheap electric power is available in nearly every community of any size in the
state, while millions of horse power remain still undeveloped in the rivers and mountain streams.
Raw material is here, in abundance, and the markets of the world are accessible through rail
and water transportation. The principal manufactured products of the state consist of lumber
and lumber products, flour, feed and various cereal foods, butter, cheese, evaporated milk,
crackers and candy, baking powder, soda, fruit extracts, clothing, boots and shoes, baskets,
bags, beer, ice, brick and other clay products, iron products, wagons and agricultural implements,
turpentine, leather products, cordage, saws, boilers, asbestos, water pipes, tin cans, railway
equipment, ships and [Page 31] boats, canned fruits and vegetables and a variety of other products.
Desirable locations are frequently offered free to those who will establish manufacturing industries.

For the Wage Earner.

The wage earner who comes to this state sufficiently fortified to maintain himself and family
for a period may usually expect to find satisfactory employment at good wages. Washington has
never been exploited as a poor man's paradise, but there is a tremendous development in progress
throughout the state in every line of industry and there is a steady demand for mechanics and
laborers of all classes.

The foregoing is intended to present in brief form an outline of the opportunities that await
the enterprising newcomer in this state. Success is being achieved in all of the various lines
touched upon, by thousands who have located here in the past few years, and as yet the resources
of the state have scarcely been touched. The future of Washington is big with promise, based
upon results already achieved, and in that future the newcomer may expect to participate in
proportion to the effort he expends.

[Page 32] WASHINGTON'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

The importance of a complete and well rounded public educational system has not been overlooked
at any stage in the growth and development of this commonwealth. From kindergarten to university
no link is wanting to supply the ambitious boy or girl with the very best training that modern
educational experts have evolved.

The common school system of the state is based upon the theory that every child must be educated,
and that the state must provide the facilities for the accomplishment of this purpose. This
theory has been carried out so thoroughly and intelligently that there is scarcely a child
in the state of school age who does not live within easy reach of a school house. Moreover,
attendance is compulsory and no child is excused unless satisfactory reasons are presented
to the proper authorities.

EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENT.

Upon admission of Washington to statehood a land endowment was granted to the state by the
federal government for common school purposes which in round numbers totals nearly two and
one-half millions of acres. This land is offered for sale or lease by the state, through the
office of the state land commissioner, and the proceeds constitute a permanent and irreducible
fund to be invested for educational purposes.

In addition to the foregoing lands, the state university has an endowment of 100,000 acres;
the agricultural college, 90,000 acres; the scientific school, 100,000 acres, and the state
normal schools, 100,000 acres. As yet only a small portion of these lands has been disposed
of. The expense of maintaining our schools, therefore, is met almost entirely by taxation.

HIGHER INSTITUTIONS.

The University of Washington occupies a campus of 350 acres, located entirely within the limits
of the city of Seattle. [Page 33] The buildings of the university consist of the administration
building, science hall, chemistry building, engineering building, power house, dormitories
for men and women, and other smaller buildings. In addition to the foregoing, the university
will come into the possession of a number of commodious structures at the conclusion of the
Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. For the current year, the enrollment of students at the university
is 1,838. The faculty consists of 115 members and for the ensuing biennial period the legislature
appropriated the sum of $673,000 for the support of the institution.

The State College of Washington is located at Pullman, in Whitman county. This institution
emphasizes technical and scientific education and in its agricultural departments has accomplished
remarkable results. It is annually giving the state a number of highly trained experts in modern
agricultural science, and the farming interests of the state have been greatly assisted by
the work of the college. Instruction is given in civil engineering, mechanical and electrical
engineering, geology, botany, chemistry, zoology, economic science and history, modern languages,
domestic economy, besides the practical operation of a dairy farm and other branches of agricultural
industry. The institution, in addition to its land endowment, receives annual assistance from
the federal government and a biennial appropriation from the state legislature.

The state also maintains three normal schools, located respectively in the cities of Bellingham,
Ellensburg and Cheney. These institutions have a combined attendance of about 850 and are the
recruiting ground for securing instructors in the public schools.

At Vancouver is the State School for the Deaf and Blind. The defective youth of the state are
cared for in a well equipped institution located at Medical Lake, in Spokane county, and at
Chehalis is the state training school for incorrigibles.

[Page 34] LOGGED-OFF LANDS.

The problem of making a home and providing a competency for old age upon the lands in western
Washington is somewhat different and more difficult than doing the same upon the prairie lands
of the east. As they come to the hands of the would-be tiller of the soil, they present a forbidding
and disagreeable aspect. The loggers have left them with considerable standing timber, with
the tops of the giants of the forests lying where they fell, scattered over the land and covering
it with an almost impenetrable mass of great limbs and brush and dead logs. If seen in the
summer, there is added the view of a mass of green vegetation, rank and to a large extent covering
up the mass of dead stuff left by the loggers with the huge stumps sticking up through it all,
mute monuments of the lost wealth of the forest. In some instances this is somewhat relieved
by the fact that, either by accident or design, the fire has been there and swept through it
all, leaving nothing but blackened and smouldering emblems of its prior greatness. In this
case, however, only the lighter part of the refuse has been destroyed. The great stumps of
fir and cedar are there still, blackened and perhaps with their dead hearts burned out. Great
and small decaying logs are there, some too wet to burn, some with the bark alone burned off,
and some with the dead centers burned out, scattered about or piled in crisscross masses as
they had fallen during the ages of the forest's growth. In either case it looks different from
the smooth surface of the sagebrush plains about to be converted into irrigated farms or the
clean face of the prairie lands covered with grass and ready and longing for the plow. But
with all their forbidding aspects, black with a portentous cloud of hard labor and long waiting,
their known hidden wealth lures on the hardy pioneer to the task. He throws off his coat, rolls
up his sleeves, gathers together his tools, and with the indomitable courage of the Anglo-Saxon
[Page 35] tackles the problem, works and fights and rests by turns till within a few years
he finds himself triumphant. Eventually, beneath his own orchard trees laden with fruit, and
in the comfort and delight of his big home fireplace, he contemplates the rewards of his struggle,
as he sees his cows complacently chewing their cuds in his green pastures and listens to the
neigh of his fat horses, and at his table, laden with all the bounty of his rich lands, thanks
his Maker for the successful completion of a hard struggle and the enjoyment it has brought
to him and his family.

MODERN METHODS.

Having thus presented the picture in perspective, we will now work out some of the details
which help to rob it of its difficulty and add to its attractiveness. If the lands have not
been burned off, and in many instances where this has been done, the rancher will find a lot
of cedar logs, perhaps partially burned, and possibly long black stubs that it will be wise
to save. Cut into proper lengths and put into piles for preservation, they will make his raw
material for fencing, barns, etc. The cedar is straight-grained, splits easy, and true, and
to the rancher is very valuable, taking the place of sawed lumber for a great many farm purposes.
Having carefully saved the cedar, the rancher will fire his clearing, thus getting rid of a
large share of the logger's waste with practically no labor. To the task of disposing of the
remaining logs and stumps he will bring modern tools and methods into action. The axe and shovel
and hand lever have given place to gunpowder, the donkey engine, derrick and winch. Stump powder
puts all the big stumps into pieces easily. The modern stump-puller lifts out the smaller stumps
with ease. The donkey engine and derrick pull together and pile the stumps and logs into great
heaps, and once more the friendly fire helps out; and while the dusky woodlands are lighted
up with passing glory the rancher sleeps to wake up and find his fields almost ready for his
plow, nor has the task had half the hard labor nor consumed half the time that years ago would
have been expended in clearing the same amount of oak and maple and hickory land in the valley
[Page 36] of the Mississippi. It should be said, however, that what is gained in time and saved
in labor costs money. The expense of clearing the logged-off land by these modern methods and
tools will run from $40 to $150 per acre, dependent upon various conditions, number and size
of stumps, etc.

There are in western Washington thousands of acres which are being pastured and tilled, from
which the large stumps have not been removed. In these instances the same methods can be used,
handling all the small logs and stumps and litter, and after the first burning, carefully repiling
and burning the refuse and then seeding to grass. In the ashes and loose soil, grass seed readily
starts, and a single season will suffice to provide fairly good pasturage, which will annually
grow better.

COST OF LABOR AND MATERIAL.

The following table, taken from the report of a government inspector, will give an idea of
the cost of the different materials and labor used in clearing logged-off land:

Cost of removing stumps from 1 foot to 4 feet in diameter from 120 acres of land in 1907:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a great many acres of these lands that can be slicked up and burned over and prepared
for seeding, not disturbing the stumps, at an expense of about $10 per acre. Thus treated,
good pasturage can be secured cheaply. In time some of the stumps will rot out and be easily
removed. When the stumps are not too thick, the lands can be successfully prepared and planted
to orchards without removing the stumps, and their unsightly appearance can be turned into
a thing of beauty and great profit by planting evergreen blackberries and loganberries about
them, using the stumps for trellises. These berries in the climate of western Washington are
wonderfully prolific and find a greedy market.

COMPENSATIONS.

There are several facts about making farms out of logged-off lands which should not be lost
sight of, because they largely compensate for the labor spent in the undertaking. One of these
is that the problem of fuel is solved for a lifetime and for the coming generation. Five acres
can be left untouched as a reserve and in a remarkably few years it will re-forest itself.
[Page 38] The growth of trees under the humid atmosphere of western Washington is astonishing,
and a very few years will suffice to provide one with a wood lot to last a generation. Meanwhile
some of the fir logs and alder and maple trees will be preserved from the fire and piled up
to provide fuel for the years until the wood lot furnishes a fresh green supply.

Then, too, as has already been suggested, the fence question, no small item in a prairie country,
is satisfactorily answered with no expenditure but for labor. The cedar logs, splitting with
ease, can be turned into rails or boards or posts--preferably the former--and the rails put
on top of each other between two posts fastened together at the top make as good a hog-tight
and cattle-proof fence as can be desired, and these rails will last in the fence for a century.
For the house, doubtless more satisfaction can be had by patronizing the nearest saw-mill,
although many houses made out of split cedar timbers and boards are in the state, proofs at
once of the usefulness of this timber and the hardihood and ingenuity of the rancher. But for
the barn and stable, pig-stye, hennery, chicken-coop and fruit boxes, and a great many other
things, the rancher patronizes his reserve log pile instead of the lumber yard, and saves time
and labor in so doing. Another fact which compensates the rancher in western Washington in
the struggle for a home which will provide a safe and generous support in his old age is that
during all the labor and waiting he is enjoying a delightful climate, in which no blizzard
drives him from his work. No cyclone endangers his life and fortune. No snakes lurk in the
underbrush. No clouds of dust blind his eyes. No sultry summer suns make him gasp for breath,
and no intense cold freezes his face or feet. He can work if he wishes as many days as there
are in the year, and know that every stroke of his axe or mattock is a part of his capital
safely invested that will pay back an annual dividend for a lifetime. No soil will respond
to his energy more quickly or more generously.

There is one more possible compensation. Fir logs and stumps and roots and bark are all full
of pitch. Factories are now in operation that are turning this wood into charcoal and [Page
39] saving and refining all the by-products, particularly turpentine, wood alcohol, pitch and
tar. These factories are successful and paying dividends, but are on a large scale and permanently
located. It is probable that some genius will soon evolve a movable plant, capable of serving
the same purpose, which can go from one ranch to another. When this is done, it will be found
that the refuse left by the logger is worth several times more than the cost of getting it
off the land with powder and fire, and, instead of being a burden upon the land of $100 per
acre, will become a matter of merchandise to be sold for much more and removed from the land
with no expense to the owner.

As a final word, it should be remembered that, after these lands are put under good tillage,
every acre can be made to return more than the cost of clearing annually. Western Washington
has never been able to produce enough to feed its wonderfully increasing population. Meats,
vegetables, fruits, poultry, eggs, etc., are all constantly coming in from outside to supply
the markets. This condition keeps prices high. It has been so for twenty years, and will be
for twenty years to come. From $100 to $500 per acre per year can be had from fruits and vegetables.
The same can be realized from poultry, nor will the dairy fall far behind when the scrub cow
is abandoned and a choice thoroughbred animal takes its place and the soil is intensely tilled
and fertilized.

The logged-off lands when first looked at are black and big labor and difficulties. When the
problem is intelligently understood--undertaken with comprehension and some capital and plenty
of grit--the solution is easy and the rewards ample and gratifying.

[Page 40] IRRIGATION IN WASHINGTON.

The lands which require irrigation in the state are chiefly the lower lands in the valleys
of the rivers east of the Cascade mountains.

The winds from the Pacific, though heavily laden with moisture, are forced to surrender the
greater portion to western Washington, as they meet the cold heights of the mountain ranges.
The mountains themselves receive a very heavy fall of snow in winter, which fills the lakes
and sources of the rivers on the eastern side, providing a large amount of water available
for irrigation purposes, for lands not too far distant. Within fifty miles from the mountain
peaks there is a drop of about 4,000 feet. The sides of the valleys in the main are gradual
slopes. These conditions make irrigation very feasible. Its wonderful results have been seen
and the process of irrigation has found a wide field within the past few years.

THE IRRIGATION AREA.

Not only the Yakima valley, where this method of farming had its beginning in the state, but
many other places, are now being made productive which were once thought wholly worthless on
account of their aridity. Among these are the Wenatchee valley, the Entiat, the Methow, the
Chelan, and the Okanogan--all on the slope of the Cascades. The immediate low lands of the
Columbia and Snake rivers and considerable of the narrow valleys of the small streams emptying
into them have in many instances been irrigated.

WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The work of reclaiming the arid lands has been wonderfully accelerated and widened in scope
by the national government. The projects of the reclamation service now include practically
all of the available waters of the Yakima valley for irrigating the lands therein. In Yakima
county alone there are probably [Page 41] 260,000 acres now under ditch, and probably 50,000
more will be reclaimed this season. This is probably not more than half the lands in the county
capable of irrigation. The fact that the general government is in control of these projects
insures as wide and just a distribution of the available waters as possible. The cost of irrigation,
which is from $50 to $60 per acre, is paid by the owners of the land in ten annual payments.
There is also an annual charge for maintaining the canals from $1.25 to $1.50 per acre. These
projects of the government cover the lands in Benton and Kittitas counties also--both of these
counties being in the Yakima valley. The government is also engaged in managing an extensive
project in the southern part of Okanogan county, where probably 50,000 acres will be reclaimed.

There is a large acreage in Franklin and Walla Walla counties, about the junctions of the Snake
and Columbia rivers, to which Pasco is central, which is arid. The government has once turned
this project down, but is now reconsidering it, and it is reported that these lands will soon
be put under ditch by the joint action of the government and the Northern Pacific railway,
which owns a large portion of the lands.

Meanwhile private enterprises are reclaiming extensive tracts in Klickitat county, and in fact
nearly all the counties bordering on the Columbia and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. It
is probable that there are more lands capable of irrigation in the state than can be irrigated
with available waters. This fact adds to the importance of the question of what to do with
arid lands when no water can be put upon them.

METHODS OF IRRIGATION.

There are three methods in use in supplying water to the arid lands. The first and the one
most generally adopted for obvious reasons is the gravity system. The waters are impounded
in lakes or artificial reservoirs and carried thence in large main canals, winding about the
hills so as to secure a low uniform grade. Once established, no other force is needed but the
usual flow of the water.

[Page 42] Another method resorted to when the gravity system is impossible is to pump the water
from the big rivers into smaller reservoirs leading to the canals, the pumps being kept busy
only during the months in which the water is needed. This method is quite successful, but requires
a somewhat larger annual expenditure. It is being used in some extensive projects, the water
being taken out of the Columbia river.

The third method is in securing the water by means of artesian wells. This method is naturally
limited to small areas, the projects being undertaken by individual private owners. Several
spots have been found in the arid belt where this method is successful.

SOILS.

The soils over the entire areas of eastern Washington on the arid lands is a volcanic ash mixed
with disintegrated basaltic rocks and some humus, varying in depth and in the amount of sand
it contains. The low lands are usually more sandy and warmer and earlier in season. The depth
of this soil is in some places 80 feet and generally so deep as to insure great permanency
to its fertility. It readily absorbs and holds moisture, and is admirably adapted to artificial
watering. In some spots there is an injurious surplus of alkali. It is generally covered with
sagebrush and has the appearance of sterility, but upon cultivation under irrigation, produces
wonderful results in quantity and quality of grains and grasses and fruits and vegetables.

GRAINS.

Wheat, oats and corn are successfully grown, but not in large acreage, because larger profits
can be realized from other crops.

HOPS AND POTATOES.

Hops, for example, which can be produced at a cost of 7-1/2 cents per pound, yield from 1,500
to 2,000 pounds per acre, and potatoes, yielding from 300 to 500 bushels per acre, and receiving
the highest market price, are both more profitable than wheat or oats.

[Page 43] ALFALFA.

Alfalfa, yielding from eight to ten tons per acre, and commanding from $6.00 to $12.00 per
ton, is a very profitable crop. Much wheat and oats are cut when in the milk and sold for hay,
and yield better returns than when matured and threshed.

FRUITS.

The smaller fruits are very profitable under irrigation, yielding from $300 to $500 net per
acre, while apples, pears, peaches, grapes, etc., often far exceed these figures, sometimes
yielding as much as $1,000 per acre net.

DAIRYING.

Dairying is extensively followed on the irrigated lands, particularly in Kittitas county, where
the cool atmosphere is very favorable, and the farmers find that turning timothy and clover,
alfalfa and grain hay into butter fat is more profitable than wheat-raising.

PREPARATION OF LAND.

There is a good deal of this arid land which will have to be freed from the sagebrush and smoothed
over before it will be fit for irrigation. This expense, together with building headgates and
lateral ditches, building flumes and seeding to alfalfa, will cost from $15.00 to $20.00 per
acre, depending upon the character of the surface, the size of the sagebrush, and amount of
flumes, etc. Some, however, very smooth lands can be prepared for seeding at less expense.

DISPOSITION OF CROPS.

The hay crops are in large part sold on the ground and fed to cattle and sheep which have summered
in the mountain ranges and are carried through the winters on the farms in the valleys. What
is left after supplying this demand is baled and shipped by rail to the markets on Puget sound,
Portland or Spokane. The Sound country is also the chief purchaser of the fruits, although
many winter apples, on account of their superior quality, are shipped to eastern markets.

[Page 44] Potatoes and other vegetables usually go west, although an occasional season finds
the eastern market depleted, and then the shipments go to the best market.

Hops are sold to be delivered at railroad stations and go east, many even to Europe.

VALUE OF LANDS.

The irrigated lands are yearly appreciating in value, mindless of the large acreage annually
added to the supply. This is largely due to the fact that they are bought up and held for speculative
purposes. However, there are still many farms in the hands of first purchasers from the government,
and others still to be had directly from the government and others from the Northern Pacific
company, not yet under ditches, which may ultimately be reclaimed. These latter can be had
from $7.00 to $25.00 per acre. The lands already under ditch, or which will soon be irrigated
certainly, are held from $50 to $100 raw and from $125 to $200 with water rights paid for.
Much land is on the market, already planted or to be planted to orchards, and cared for, for
a term of years until the orchards are in bearing, which can be purchased on easy terms, ranging
in price from $200 to $500 per acre.

TRANSPORTATION.

Nearness to transportation is a valuable factor in determining the price of lands--whether
under irrigation or otherwise. The lands being irrigated in eastern Washington are, for the
most part, adjacent to competing railways and water craft on both the Columbia and Snake rivers.
Projects are in contemplation by the government and state to remove all obstructions from the
Columbia river and give a great navigable stream from Kettle Falls to the mouth of the river.
This will add to the shipping facilities by increasing the number of boats which will ply the
river and be of great help to all farmers holding lands adjacent. Numerous trolley lines are
already running in many directions--and more are projected--among the irrigated farms connecting
with the cities of Spokane, North Yakima, [Page 45] and Walla Walla. These add greatly to the
facility and cheapness of transportation.

CLIMATE.

The character of the climate is well suggested by the crops which can be harvested. They include
peaches, apricots, grapes, figs, tomatoes, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other things which
require a warm summer and warm soil. Very little moisture comes upon the land in the summer.
The winters are moderately cold, with some snow, which is joyfully hailed by the farmers, for
all moisture is quickly absorbed by the soil and held for summer's use. The spring season is
two or three weeks earlier than in the Puget sound basin. Moderate winds prevail during the
summer months, coming from the east and west by turns, and prevent excessive sultry weather.

OCCUPATIONS.

Aside from the ordinary agricultural pursuits suggested by the foregoing, which includes grain-growing,
horticulture, dairying and truck gardening, should be mentioned stock-raising, particularly
of sheep, many thousands of which are yearly wintered in the valleys and summered on the ranges.
Bee culture and poultry-raising are also both becoming important.

In closing, it should be said that the activity of the government and private investors together
has given a great impetus to the settlement of these arid lands, and the population is rapidly
increasing, being made up of a miscellaneous assortment of Uncle Sam's energetic, wideawake,
industrious citizens, building homes and making fortunes more rapidly, probably, than in any
other part of irrigated regions in his domain.

The doors are open, too, for the newcomers, for ten times the population now there can well
be made prosperous.

[Page 46] THE COUNTIES AND MORE IMPORTANT CITIES AND TOWNS OF WASHINGTON

ADAMS COUNTY

LOCATION.

Adams county is in the center of southeastern Washington, cut out of the once great desert
plateau, covered with sage brush. It has developed into one of the most important food-producing
counties of the state. It has a population of about 13,000 and covers 1,908 square miles of
territory.

CLIMATE.

Its climate is not different from that of the balance of the district in which it is situated,
and, although some days in winter are severely cold and some in summer hot, its dry atmosphere
softens the asperity of its cold, and its generous crop yields are full compensation for the
heat of the summer's sun. Its mean temperature ranges from 30 degrees to 40 degrees in winter
and from 50 to 74 degrees in summer. Its usual coldest days are 20 degrees to 25 degrees and
its hottest ranging above 100 degrees. Its rain and snow give about 12 inches of water. It
has one small stream, a tributary of the Palouse river.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific railway cutting the county diagonally from northeast to southwest and
the Oregon Railroad & Navigation railway across its southeast corner and near its south and
west borders furnish good facilities for handling its generous wheat crops. To these are soon
to be added the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Portland & Seattle, and the North Coast
roads, giving the county very superior railroad facilities.

INDUSTRIES.

Wheat is its great staple crop, and the last year out of a crop acreage of 275,000 gave to
the world nearly 6,000,000 bushels, an average of upwards of 20 bushels to the acre. When this
average is compared with that of the wheat fields of the Mississippi valley, it is no wonder
that the value of its realty has increased for the purposes of taxation more than 300 per cent.
in the past six years. Horses, cattle, hogs and sheep are to a limited extent raised on the
farms, and are important adjuncts to its prosperity.

[Page 47] PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

RITZVILLE is the county seat, and has a city hall, electric lights and water system, flour
and feed mills, and is the chief distributing center of the county.

LIND will be one of the important points on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railway, now
building across the county.

WASHTUCNA also is to have another outlet for its wheat over the Portland & Seattle railway,
projected and building. All these towns have good schools, churches, warehouses, mercantile
establishments, and all enjoy an abundance of prosperity from the marketing of the crops.

ASOTIN COUNTY

LOCATION.

Asotin county occupies the extreme southeastern corner of the state, being separated from Idaho
on the east by the Snake river and from Oregon on the south by the state boundary. Its population
is about 7,500, its area 640 square miles.

It takes in a portion of the Blue mountains, from which numerous small streams furnish abundant
water for all domestic farm purposes and for irrigating quite a large area of lands, which
makes the county ideal for the stock-raiser and fruit-grower.

INDUSTRIES.

The irrigation of the low lands has had a wonderful effect in stimulating the fruit industry,
and resulted in a great advance in land values, particularly about Clarkston and Cloverland,
while the cool water of the mountain streams and their grassy slopes make the dairy business
especially profitable. General farming, however, is still the standby of the bulk of the population.
At Clarkston the lands irrigated and planted to orchards have reached in many instances a value
of $1,000 per acre, the waters being taken out of Asotin creek. About Cloverland, waters from
George creek have wrought almost an equal increase in values. Cloverland is on a plateau about
2,500 feet above sea level, and the lands irrigated and planted to winter apples are paying
handsome dividends to their fortunate owners. On ordinary farm lands wheat yields 25 to 50
bushels per acre and barley from 40 to 60 bushels per acre.

TRANSPORTATION.

The transportation is limited to the power of steamboats on the Snake river and the Oregon
Railroad & Navigation railway, which is reached at Lewiston, across the river from Clarkston.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

ASOTIN, the county seat, situated about seven miles south of Clarkston, on the Snake river,
has about 1,500 people within its borders. It [Page 48] has a flour mill, warehouses, churches,
schools, public library, light and water systems, and is a prosperous, thriving town.

CLARKSTON, an important commercial center, is situated on the flats of the Snake river, in
the northeast part of the county. Its population somewhat exceeds that of Asotin. It has all
the business institutions of a thriving town, is the main distributing point for a large area,
and is rapidly growing.

CLOVERLAND, CRAIGIE AND ANATONE are thriving smaller towns.

BENTON COUNTY

Benton county is bounded north, east and south by the Columbia river and west by Yakima and
Klickitat counties. It has an area of 1,600 square miles and a population of about 9,000 people.

TOPOGRAPHY.

The Yakima river traverses the center of the county in a very crooked course, through the valley
of which the Northern Pacific railroad winds its way to the top of the Cascades. Both north
and south of the valley of the Yakima are extensive hill and plateau lands, which are being
rapidly utilized for general farming. The valley lands are arid and useless without irrigating
water.

IRRIGATION.

Extensive irrigation projects are in successful operation and projected to bring a very large
portion of the valley lands into successful use, for these lands, when irrigated, are of unsurpassed
fertility. Lands capable of irrigation have rapidly risen in value during the past few years
because of the immense yields of all crops under irrigation.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific railway through its center, the Portland & Seattle around its southern
and eastern border and the North Coast coming into the Yakima valley from the northeast and
the southeast, together with the shipping on the Columbia river, give abundant means of marketing
its products, while several local electric roads are projected to connect its towns and help
to open up the newly developed portions of the county.

IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES.

General farming on the uplands, truck-gardening and fruit-raising on the irrigated lower lands
are the chief occupations. On account of the great fertility of the volcanic soils and the
early springs, Benton county is able to supply the large towns with fruits and vegetables some
two weeks earlier than most other sections, giving it quite an advantage in prices. The county
is rapidly growing in population and prosperity.

[Page 49] PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

PROSSER, its chief town and county seat, is on the Yakima river and Northern Pacific railway
in the western central part of the county, and has about 2,000 population. It is the chief
distributing center of the county. It has three weekly newspapers, six churches, good water
supply, banks, stores, warehouses, lumber yards, etc.

KENNEWICK, at the easterly center of the county, on the Northern Pacific and Portland & Seattle
railroads and on the Columbia river, is a town of much importance, having about 1,500 people.
It is noted for the remarkable earliness of its fruits and vegetables. It has the usual business,
church and school establishments, including an ice and cold storage plant.

KIONA, on the Yakima river, midway between Prosser and Kennewick, CARLEY AND PETERSON, in the
southern portion of the county, on the Columbia river, are all growing and prospering smaller
towns.

CHEHALIS COUNTY

Chehalis county is central among the counties bordering on the Pacific, the towns about Grays
Harbor being its seaports. It has an area of 2,600 square miles and a population of 35,000.

RESOURCES.

Its industries arise out of its vast timber belts, its fertile low lands, and its fisheries.
It is said to have 800,000 acres of magnificent timber lands, the great bulk of it unmarketed.
Logging and the manufacture of wood products make up its chief occupation, though general farming
and fruit-raising is rapidly gaining. The lands of the county when reclaimed from the forests
are fertile and respond generously to the labor of the husbandman. In 1906, 15,000 apple trees
were planted in the county. The fishing industry, including the canning of salmon, sardines,
clams and oysters, is a thriving industry and destined to develop into much larger proportions.

TRANSPORTATION.

Grays Harbor is open to the ocean, but is splendidly protected and has safe anchorage. It is
the largest lumber shipping port in the state. The Humptulips and Chehalis rivers empty their
waters into the bay, and are both navigable for some distance.

In addition, the Northern Pacific railroad skirts both sides of the bay and a logging railroad
from Shelton, in Mason county, has nearly reached the ocean, going through the county from
east to west. Other railroads have surveying parties in the field, and a conflict is on to
share the vast lumber-carrying trade of the county with the Northern Pacific, which has till
now monopolized it.

Chehalis county is one of the most important counties in the state, and offers an abundant
opportunity for Yankee energy to exercise itself [Page 50] in almost every avenue of business.
Its opportunities and resources are numerous and vast. The newcomer may look long and find
no better place for his talents.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

MONTESANO is the county seat, located at the head of navigation on the Chehalis river, and
on the Northern Pacific railway. It has a population of about 3,500. It has sawmills, sash
and door factories, and is surrounded by a prosperous farming community, dairying being very
remunerative.

ABERDEEN is the commercial metropolis of the county. Nearly $15,000 is daily paid out to wage-earners.
Much commerce from the ocean is centering here, 736 vessels clearing from Grays Harbor in 1907.
Seven hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars has been appropriated by congress for the
improvement of the harbor. The city has terminal rail rates, and the Northern Pacific and Chicago,
Milwaukee & St. Paul railroads are hustling after its trade. The business portion of the city
is built of stone, brick or cement. It has eleven large sawmills, many shingle mills and various
other factories for utilizing the products of its timber, besides fish and clam canneries and
other factories. Its population, now about 15,000, is rapidly growing.

HOQUIAM, Aberdeen's nearby neighbor, has a population crowding 11,000, and is a hustling manufacturing
and commercial center, not different in its general business from Aberdeen.

ELMA, twelve miles east of Montesano, is a town of 2,700.

COSMOPOLIS, south of the river from Aberdeen, has about 1,200, and is a sawmill town.

OAKVILLE, MAKRHAM and SATSOP are small growing towns on the Northern Pacific railway. Many
other embryo towns will in time grow into prosperous business centers.

CHELAN COUNTY

Chelan county is one of picturesque beauty and abundance of both developed and undeveloped
wealth. It faces the Columbia river eastward, while its back rests against the peaks of the
Cascades, 5,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea. Lake Chelan is the largest fresh water body in
the state, fifty miles long and one to four wide, and lies 400 feet higher than the Columbia river.

Chelan county has 2,000 square miles, much of it mountainous and full of minerals. Its population
is at present about 14,000.

RESOURCES.

Horticulture, agriculture, lumbering, stock-raising, mining and dairying all flourish on the
bountiful natural fitness of the county for these occupations. The climate is attractive. It
is a sunshiny county.

[Page 51] TRANSPORTATION.

Steamers ply up and down the Columbia river. The Great Northern railway crosses the county
through the valley of the Wenatchee river and the Washington & Great Northern railway is projected
along the western boundary of the Columbia river.

PRODUCTS.

All kinds of temperate zone fruits mature here in wonderful perfection and abundance. The valleys
run with water from the mountains to irrigate the lands, and furnish vast power, much of it
undeveloped. Hills in the western part of the county are timbered and all the vacant lands
are grass covered. Over 1,000,000 fruit trees have been planted in the last three years in
the county.

The mountain foothills are full of mineral veins of copper, gold, silver, lead and molybdonite.
Some have been producing for twenty years. Trout in the streams and game on the hills add to
its attractiveness.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

WENATCHEE is the county seat and largest town, having about 3,500 people. It is located on
the Columbia river near where the Great Northern railway crosses it. It is the chief distributing
center for the county and much other territory, chiefly north of it.

LEAVENWORTH, westward of Wenatchee, and also on the railroad, has a population of 1,200 and
is a division point.

CHELAN, at the foot of Lake Chelan, has about 700 people.

CASHMERE, on the railroad, is of about equal size.

LAKESIDE, PESHASTIN and ENTIAT are smaller towns, all thriving and growing.

CLALLAM COUNTY

Clallam county occupies 2,000 square miles of the northwestern part of the Olympic peninsula,
having 35 miles of shore land on the Pacific and 90 miles on the straits. The Olympic mountains
and foothills cover the southern half mostly, while the northern half is made up of lower hills
and valleys. Several large lakes nestle among the mountains; one of them, Lake Crescent, is
a famous summer resort. Lake Crescent is known as the home of the celebrated Beardslee trout.
The eastern and southern parts have a rainfall sometimes nearing 100 inches annually, while
in the eastern northerly part it is about 20 to 25 inches only.

An important section of the county is that known as Sequim Prairie This is a level district
of about 5,000 acres, located three miles back from Port Williams. Most of it is under irrigation,
and the soil thus treated produces marvelous crops.

[Page 52] RESOURCES.

Lumber, fish, agricultural products and coal comprise its chief resources. The timber of the
county is very vast and very little exploited. Its proximity to the ocean makes it very advantageous
for all fishing industries. Its valleys are noted for the fertility of their soils, and many
a farmer has grown wealthy from their cultivation.

TRANSPORTATION.

Facilities for getting about are limited to boats and wagons. A splendid boat service is maintained
with Seattle and other Sound ports, and a system of public roads is now in process of construction
that will be unexcelled in the state. Several surveying parties are now in the woods and it
is believed that Grays Harbor and the Straits of Juan de Fuca will be soon united with railroad
iron and Clallam county will come to its own.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS AND VILLAGES.

PORT ANGELES, located about 60 miles from the ocean on the Straits of Fuca, is the largest
town and county seat. It has a splendid harbor, with fine anchorage, furnishing a safe refuge
for ships when the storms rage outside.

DUNGENESS and SEQUIM, three miles from PORT WILLIAMS, are important farming centers, both noted
for their dairy products, and contribute largely to make Clallam the second county in the state
in the value of its dairy products.

QUILLAYUTE, FORKS, BEAVER, BLYN and GETTYSBURG are other small settlements waiting for the
railroads to open up the country and render their natural resources available for the good
of the world.

CLARKE COUNTY

Clarke county lies on the north shore of the Columbia river, opposite Portland, Oregon. It
has 600 square miles of territory. It was one of the earliest settled parts of the state, and
its timber as yet uncut is large. It is extremely well watered. The Columbia and Lewis rivers
border it on three sides with navigable waters. It has a mild climate, very fertile soil, and
splendid markets at its doors, abundant rainfall, and agriculture is successfully carried on
without irrigation.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific railway connects its various towns with both Portland and Seattle, and
the North Bank and Oregon & Washington railroad, paralleling the Northern Pacific, will add
greatly to the facility and cheapness of its transportation. From Vancouver northeasterly a
road is in operation nearly across the county, headed for North Yakima and the East.

[Page 53] INDUSTRIES.

Much of the southern part of the county is devoted to fruit-raising, prunes being a very prominent
factor in the county's output. General agriculture, with dairying, are very profitable, and
to these are to be added fishing, lumbering and mining.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

VANCOUVER has a population of about 8,000, and is rapidly growing. It is the county seat, and
is connected with Portland, Oregon, by a trolley line. The Northern Pacific, Union Pacific,
Oregon Railroad & Navigation and North Bank railroads all compete for its traffic. It is the
central distributing point of the county, and is the United States military headquarters for
Washington, Oregon and Alaska. It is well represented in business establishments, including
barrel factory, fruit cannery, ship yard, iron foundry, shoe factory, and others.

LA CENTER, ETNA, NACOLT, AMBOY and BRUSH PRAIRIE are smaller towns, all holding out an inviting
hand to the newcomer, and offering desirable opportunities for new business in both merchandising
and agriculture, as well as in lumbering and its kindred industries. Clarke county is one well
worth investigating by intending settlers, both on account of its latent possibilities and
because of its peculiarly desirable climatic conditions, and its abundant competing transportation
facilities, both by rail and water.

COLUMBIA COUNTY

Columbia county is one of the four counties in southeastern Washington, lying on the Oregon
state line and south of the Snake river. A forest reserve in the Blue mountains covers much
of the southern portion of the county, which is heavily timbered. The Northern part of the
county is made up of rolling prairie lands, of great fertility on account of the large proportion
of clay added to the volcanic ash, which composes most of the soils of eastern Washington.
Irrigation is here unnecessary, and abundant crops reward the agriculturist. The climate is
mild, healthful and vigorous, inclining to much outdoor life the year around.

PRODUCTS.

Columbia county is essentially an agricultural county, but of late years is branching out into
fruit-raising and dairying with marked success. Apples and pears predominate among the fruits,
though all others do well. Wheat is, however, still its great product, and both the Northern
Pacific and Oregon Railroad & Navigation railroads are in operation through the northern part
of the county to carry away its rich grain harvests.

The citizens of Columbia county are among the most prosperous of the state, its average of
per capita wealth being exceeded by only three other counties.

[Page 54] PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

DAYTON, the county seat, has a population of about 3,500 people, is situated about in the center
of the county, and is the chief town for the county's exports, as well as the distributor of
its merchandise. It is a substantially built city, with flour and feed mills, and general mercantile
establishments of importance. All the public interests, including schools and churches, are
generously provided for. Its chief exports are grain, fruit, livestock and wool.

STARBUCK, in the northern part of the county, is a shipping point of no mean importance on
the Oregon Railroad & Navigation railway.

COWLITZ COUNTY

Cowlitz county lies immediately north of Clarke county, bordering about 40 miles on the Columbia
river. It has about 1,100 square miles of territory, and about 13,000 people. The southwestern
portion is largely composed of level valley lands, while its northeastern part is occupied
by the foothills of Mount St. Helens. The drainage is all westerly and southerly into the Columbia
river. Cowlitz river is navigable as far as Castle Rock, and is an important factor in the
transportation problem.

RESOURCES.

Timber is the great source of industry at present, the county having about two-thirds of its
area heavily covered and unexploited. About 40 saw and shingle mills are engaged in disposing
of its logs. Agriculture follows close on the heels of the lumberman everywhere in western
Washington, and nowhere are better results in general farming and dairying obtained than in
Cowlitz county.

Cowlitz coal fields have not yet been largely utilized, but will be extensively developed in time.

TRANSPORTATION.

Aside from the river navigation, this county is well supplied with transportation facilities
by rail. The valley of the Cowlitz river affords the natural highway for roads between the
Columbia river and Puget sound, and is already traversed by the Northern Pacific, while the
Union Pacific systems and the North Coast road are projected over practically parallel lines
through the county. From Kalama all three systems extend south to Portland and Vancouver.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

KALAMA, on the bank of the Columbia river at the ferry crossing of the Northern Pacific railway,
is the chief town and county seat. There are here extensive electric power plants and a gravity
water system. The chief industries grow out of the lumbering and fishing interests. It has
about 1,250 people, but is just now rapidly growing, owing to its superb transportation facilities
by both rail and water.

[Page 55] KELSO and CASTLE ROCK are both important towns on the railroads and Cowlitz river,
each having about 1,500 people. At Kelso, which is near the Columbia river, considerable fish
are caught and packed, yet the timber furnishes the chief industry. Fruit and dairying and
general agriculture provide a large part of the support for the town merchants.

OSTRANDER, CARROLTON, CATLIN, ARIEL and LEXINGTON are smaller towns, all prospering and being
built up into substantial business centers by the steadily increasing development of the latent
resources of the county.

This county offers many opportunities for business to the newcomer in either merchandising,
manufacturing or farming.

DOUGLAS COUNTY

Douglas county occupies the big bend of the Columbia river, having about 1,800 square miles
of territory. Formerly there were 4,500 square miles. The last legislature carved the county
in two, giving Grant county the southeastern part, about 2,700 square miles of territory, and
leaving 1,800 to the northeastern part, with the old name. The bend of the Columbia on the
northeast and Grant county on the southeast, compose its boundary. This division boundary follows
the northeastern bank of the Grand coulee, and following its general direction meets the Columbia
river where the Great Northern railroad touches its valley, thus putting all of that railroad
in this new county, excepting only a few miles of the railroad along the banks of the river
in the southeastern corner of Douglas county. Douglas county is essentially a high plateau,
some of it 1,500 feet above the main bank. Waterville is the county seat, and considerable
land along the valley of the Columbia is being irrigated and proving to be of great value for
fruit and grain growing.

In the southeastern part of the county are some lands covered with black basaltic rocks, but
the great bulk of the lands are rich in a volcanic ash soil, and produce large crops of grain
without irrigation. A wrong view of the county can easily be impressed upon the traveler by
rail; he will see so many of the basaltic rocks from the car windows but once up out of the
canyon which the railroad follows, he will find himself in view of an expanse of wheat fields
so vast and rich as to astonish him.

RESOURCES.

As already indicated, this county is essentially a grain producer. Wheat and oats are marketed
in large quantities. Fruit-growing and stock-raising are important adjuncts to the county's
wealth. It is comparatively new, and lands can be had at very reasonable prices.

TRANSPORTATION.

As now constituted, Douglas county will rely wholly upon the steamboat crafts on the river
to get its grain to market. Its trade, however, [Page 56] is too vast to be passed by, and
already two lines of railroad, the Washington & Great Northern and North Coast, are projecting
into the very center of its vast wheat fields. With these roads completed as projected, Douglas
county will have easy access to both water and rail transportation, and renewed importance
will be given to its farming industries.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

WATERVILLE is its chief town and county seat. It is among the wheat fields, in a broad plain,
about seven miles east of the Columbia river, to which it is connected by good roads for stages
and freight wagons. It has one of the U. S. general land offices. It has good schools and churches,
water and electric lighting systems, both owned by the city. It has a population of about 1,200
people, and is well supplied with business houses, flour and feed mills, a brick yard, bank, etc.

BRIDGEPORT, a town of some 400 people, is situated in the northern part of the county on the
Columbia river east of its junction with the Okanogan river, and is an important wheat-shipping
point, having a regular steamboat service. A bank, flour mill, warehouses and general stores
are serving the community, but other industries await the newcomer.

DOUGLAS, FARMER, JAMESON, MANSFIELD and HOLLISTER are growing agricultural centers.

FERRY COUNTY

Ferry county is about in the center of the northern part of eastern Washington, stretching
from the northern boundary of the state to the Columbia river, which marks its southern and
southwestern boundary. The southern half of the county is within the Colville Indian reservation,
and is therefore wholly undeveloped. The lands, however, have in fact been allotted and the
remainder will be thrown open for settlement in the near future.

Altogether it has an area of 2,200 square miles, and a population of 5,000. It is principally
composed of low mountains, well timbered, with valleys furnishing fine grazing.

CLIMATE.

The climate of the county is such as prevails generally in northeastern Washington--a couple
of months of snow in winter, affording plenty of sleighing, skating, etc. Summers are very
pleasant, and spring and fall delightful.

RESOURCES.

The bulk of the resources of this county are yet dormant. The mountains are full of minerals;
timber is abundant; grassy hillsides are tempting to the sheep and cattle, while the soil is
rich, and when tilled will be found to produce excellent crops. The county has a fine future
for wealth from all these sources, and, while the mines are [Page 57] first to be made productive,
without doubt the fruits and cereals will come into their own in time and furnish much of its
wealth.

TRANSPORTATION.

Two railroads reach the center of the northern half of the county, terminating at Republic,
the county seat. These railroads have pushed in here after the precious metals mined in the
vicinity.

The Columbia river is navigable most of its course on the county boundary, barring some obstructions
which the national government will remove and thus open up to river navigation to the ocean
the fruits of toil in Ferry county.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

REPUBLIC, the county seat, is the only large town in the county, and has a population of about
1,250 people.

It is the distributing point for supplies for the mines and ships out much ore for the smelters.

Ferry county altogether offers exceptional opportunities for the homeseeker in a variety of
occupations, as already indicated.

FRANKLIN COUNTY

Franklin county occupies the basin formed by the junction of the Columbia and Snake rivers,
being bounded east, south and west by them. The southern portion of the county is scarcely
300 feet above sea level, and the soil is fine and sandy. The northern part of the county is
somewhat higher and composed of successive benches till they reach an altitude of 1,000 feet.
It is only a few years since these lands were all considered barren and useless. Yet in 1906
these bench lands in this county added 1,500,000 bushels of wheat to the world's supply and
in the following season nearly doubled that output.

There are no forests, the land being covered with bunchgrass and sagebrush.

IRRIGATION.

Along the rivers some farmers have irrigated small parcels of land by pumping water, but the
bulk of the irrigable lands are awaiting the action of the U. S. Reclamation Service, which
it is thought will ultimately be engaged in an extensive irrigation problem to reclaim thousands
of acres now arid and barren. The warm climate of these low Bandy lands has already been proven
to be immensely advantageous to the gardener and fruit-grower, and the lands wonderfully productive
when the magic influence of plenty of water renders the sources of plant life soluble.

The wheat crops now being produced come from the bench lands without irrigation.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific railway passes diagonally through the county and crosses the Columbia
river near Pasco. The Oregon Railroad & [Page 58] Navigation railway taps the wheat belt in
the northern part of the county and the North Coast is projected through it, while the Portland
& Seattle follows the north bank of the Snake river along its southwestern boundary, thus giving
the county four systems of railroad, besides the Columbia river steamboats.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

PASCO is the county seat, in the extreme southern portion of the county, near the Columbia
river, and is more noted as a railroad center than as a shipping point, on account of the fact
that the surrounding lands are as yet unirrigated. It has a population of about 1,800, and
is just now enjoying new vigor and much building in anticipation of its future usefulness as
a commercial center for distribution of both merchandise and agricultural products.

CONNELL, in the northern part of the county, is a shipping point of importance, and has two
railroad lines and a third one coming. In addition to the cereals, many sheep and horses are
being raised and shipped out of the county from this vicinity.

GARFIELD COUNTY

Garfield county is the second from the southeast corner of the state, and extends from the
Snake river on the north to the state boundary on the south. It has 627 square miles of territory
and a population of about 7,000.

The southern portion is included in the Wenaha forest reserve, and is quite heavily timbered.
The northern portion is an extremely prolific farming region, made up of undulating lands with
deep rich soil, composed of clays and volcanic ash. No irrigation is necessary, and very heavy
crops of grain are annually matured.

RESOURCES.

As already intimated, the chief source of income for the county comes from the tillage of the
soil. Of the crops raised, barley is in the lead, having furnished 1,800,000 bushels in 1907,
which places this county second of all counties in the state in the production of this cereal.
Wheat and oats are also largely produced. Stock-raising in the southern ranges of the county
is very profitable, and much fruit is of late years being produced. Indeed, Garfield county
is well up to the front in the per capita wealth of its citizens.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

POMEROY is the county seat and chief distributing center of the county. It is situated in the
north central part of the county, on the Pataha river and the Oregon Railroad & Navigation
railway. It has a population of nearly 2,000.

It is lighted with electricity, has a gravity water system, and all the machinery for doing
all the business naturally coming to a town [Page 59] of its size. It has a fine high school
and graded schools, churches, newspapers, banks, warehouses, big stocks of goods, fire department,
cet.

GRANT COUNTY

Grant county occupies about 2,700 square miles of what was formerly Douglas county, comprising
the lands southeast of the Grand and Moses coulees, bordering on the southwest on the Columbia
river, with Adams and Lincoln counties on its eastern border.

Ephrata is the county seat, on the Great Northern railway. The northern part of the county
is traversed by the Great Northern railroad, and has developed into a vast region of grain
production without irrigation, although originally supposed to be valueless for cereal-raising.

The southern part is new and comparatively undeveloped, but is crossed by the Chicago, Milwaukee
& St. Paul railway, just now giving this new county great impetus. The southern portion of
the county has long been a grazing ground for herds of cattle and horses, but it is thought
now it will be turned into a prosperous region of small farms.

While the county is cut by several coulees, it is chiefly composed of large areas of bench
lands, comparatively level, barring a range of hills in its southwestern corner called Saddle
mountains. There is considerable water in the county, Moses lake being quite a large body of
water with bordering swampy lands, about in the center, and Wilson creek, in the northern and
Crab creek, in the southern part, furnishing considerable stock water.

LANDS.

The lands tributary to the Great Northern railway already produce great quantities of grain
and livestock, and these will continue to be its staple crops until irrigation may come in
and stimulate fruit production, for which it is thought much of the lands will be suitable.

TRANSPORTATION.

Both the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railway systems are in the grain fields of the
northern part of the county. The Milwaukee road crosses the southern part, the N. & S. is projected
along its western border, paralleling the Columbia river, which is navigable, thus affording
all the county, excepting the central portion, good facilities for marketing its products.
As the county develops, beyond question branch lines will penetrate this portion, and Grant
county will become as well supplied as any other portion of the state with facilities for commerce.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

EPHRATA, the county seat, is a small village on the Great Northern railway about midway of
the county and the center of a large wheat-growing section. Its transformation into an important
town is rapidly [Page 60] going on, the new county government calling for a variety of new
occupations to center here.

WILSON CREEK, near the eastern border of the county, is a larger town whose chief industry
is marketing grain. It is an important distributing point, with prospects of larger growth.

QUINCY is a station on the Great Northern and is also an important wheat-shipping point.

SOAP LAKE, on a lake of the same name, is noted as a resort for the rheumatic.

BACON, COULEE CITY, and HARTLINE are stations on the Northern Pacific railway in the northeastern
part of the county.

Grant county is new, but has large undeveloped resources, and is awaiting the newcomer with
abundant offerings for his energy and labor.

ISLAND COUNTY

Island county is entirely composed of a group of islands in Puget sound, the largest two being
Whidby and Camano. It has a land area of 227 square miles and a population of about 5,000.

RESOURCES.

Lumber, agricultural products and fish make up the county's resources. Considerable of the
timber, particularly from Whidby island, has been removed, and wheat, oats, hay, potatoes,
fruits, poultry, butter, eggs, etc., are now shipped out to the splendid nearby markets at
the chief seaport towns on Puget Sound.

The soils in the northern part of Whidby island are of remarkable fertility, some of them producing
as much as 100 bushels of wheat per acre and immense crops of potatoes.

In season the waters of the county abound in salmon and other salt water fish, and many of
the citizens of the county find profitable employment in connection with the fishing industry.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

COUPEVILLE is a town of some 400 people and the county seat, situated on a beautiful bay in
the northern part of Whidby island. It is chief distributing point for the county, has a sawmill,
shingle mill, fruit-drying establishment, stores, churches, schools, a newspaper, etc.

OAK HARBOR, further north, is the center of a large farming and logging district. Two canneries
are in successful operation.

UTSALADY, SAN DE FUCA, CAMANO, CLINTON, and LANGLEY are smaller villages gradually becoming
summer resorts for people from the large cities of the sound. Steamboats furnish good transportation
from all parts of the county.

[Page 61] JEFFERSON COUNTY

Jefferson county is the second county south of the entrance of Puget sound, stretching from
the Pacific ocean eastward over the peaks of the Olympic mountains to Hood's canal, and turning
north gets a long waterfront also on Puget sound, and taps the Straits of Fuca. It has a population
of 11,000 people and 2,000 square miles of territory.

RESOURCES.

The resources of this county are largely undeveloped, and yet it is one of the oldest settled
counties in the state. Originally its entire area, barring a few small patches, was heavily
timbered, and it is estimated that the county still has twenty billion feet of standing timber.
Its soil is remarkably fertile, and the products of its farms have long been famous.

The Olympic mountains contain veins of precious metals, iron and manganese, none of which have
as yet been thoroughly developed.

Fishing for salmon, sardines, shrimps, clams and crabs is a very important industry.

SOILS, CLIMATE AND PRODUCTS.

The soils of the county are largely sedimentary, having been washed down from the mountains
for ages, assisted by the decomposition of vegetable matter accumulated through centuries.
In the valleys, where most of the farming is being done, these soils produce remarkable crops
under the influence of the charming climate the county affords.

The rainfall in the eastern part of the county is moderate, but ample for all purposes; the
average rainfall is about 20 inches. The temperature rarely exceeds 80 degrees in summer, while
the winter months average about 45 degrees.

Such soils and such climatic conditions combine to force wealth upon every industrious tiller
of the soil. Clover yields from four to six tons per acre.

Oats and vetches for ensilage purposes yield five to seven tons per acre. Fifty to seventy-five
tons of cabbage or mangles per acre are not uncommon, and onions and potatoes produce from
six to ten tons. The fruit trees, particularly cherries, apples, and pears, produce wonderful
crops. Cattle can graze ten months in the year or more, and the products of the dairies of
Jefferson county cannot be excelled.

Because of the light rainfall and moderate weather, this county is admirably suited to poultry-raising.
Green food can be had twelve months in the year. Runs can always be open, and with proper care
hens can be made to pay $3.00 per year each.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

PORT TOWNSEND, at the entrance of Puget sound, is the county seat and chief commercial center
of the county. It has a population of [Page 62] about 6,000. It is the headquarters for many
government institutions, including the U. S. customs service, U. S. revenue cutter service,
marine hospital service, hydrographic service, quarantine service, and U. S. artillery for
the Puget sound district.

Three great forts; Worden, Flagler, and Casey, are located here, forming the chief defense
to Puget sound. Fort Worden joins the city limits. The present garrison force is 2,000. The
scenery from the city is grand and beyond compare.

Its business interests are varied and extensive. Two canneries for salmon and sardines are
here located, boiler works, a machine shop for building electric and gasoline engines, a shipyard,
sash and door factory, lumber mills, and shingle mills, a by-product plant producing wood alcohol,
turpentine, etc.

The city is substantially built and its homes are artistically created.

The harbor has twenty-five miles of waterfront and fine anchorage of from nine to eighteen
fathoms, and is an ideal refuge for all seagoing craft.

The city has gas and electric lights, paid fire department, fine churches, splendid schools,
and a magnificent gravity water system furnishes the town of Irondale, Hadlock and Forts Worden
and Flagler, having plenty of water to spare for thousands mote.

IRONDALE is practically a suburb of Port Townsend, having the only pig iron plant in the state.
It is an extensive and growing concern, using bog iron from the vicinity and other ores from
different sources.

PORT LUDLOW, DUCKABUSH, BOGACHIEL, PORT DISCOVERY, QUILCENE, and CHIMACUM are small villages
scattered about the county and are centers of agricultural activity.

KING COUNTY

King county is distinguished by having Seattle for its county seat. The county is an empire
in itself, stretching from the shores of Puget sound to the peaks of the Cascade mountains,
and containing more than 2,000 square miles of territory. It also includes Vashon, one of the
large islands of the sound.

RESOURCES.

King county's sources of revenue are varied and extensive. Its lumber industry, growing out
of the vast forests within its borders not only, but from the cutting of logs brought in from
other sections of the state, is immense.

Its agricultural lands are not surpassed in fertility by any, and include not only the alluvial
deposits in its river bottoms, but great areas of shot clay and other soils splendidly adapted
to fruit culture.

Its mining industries include not only very great acreage of coal measures, which have been
producing coal for commercial purposes for local and foreign trade for thirty years and are
scarcely scratched as yet, but also fissure veins of the precious metals--gold, silver, lead,
[Page 63] copper, antimony, arsenic, and also iron, asbestos, fire clays, kaolin, granite,
sandstones, lime ledges, and others.

Its fishing industries in its own waters and from the ocean give employment to a large number
of men and its fish are shipped even as far east as Boston, Massachusetts.

Its power capacity, in addition to its wood and coal, includes great falls and rapids and many
large streams which are already harnessed, but only in part, and driving vast quantities of
machinery in this and adjoining counties.

In commercial possibilities King county is unrivaled. Its combination of lakes, rivers and
salt water harbors have no superior on the globe, and the fact of its supremacy is demonstrated
by the tabulated statistics of state officers, which show that King county possesses one-fifth
of the population of the state and has more than one-quarter in value of taxable property of
the state, and pays one-fourth of taxes collected within the state borders.

In scenery, which is no mean asset of the county, it is also unsurpassed. Vast ranges of mountains,
sheets of fresh and salt water, rivers, hills and plains, forests, and grassy fields combine
and interlace in a thousand directions to entrance and delight the artistic eye.

In game, including bear, deer, mountain goats, cougar, grouse, pheasants, quail, mountain trout,
salmon and other fishes, make many a paradise for the sportsman.

TRANSPORTATION.

In addition to its salt waterways, with 75 miles of shore lands, and its navigable fresh water
lakes, there are centering in the county coming in from all directions seven transcontinental
lines of railroads, making King county and its metropolis a great distributing center for the
commerce between the American continent and the continents of Asia and the islands of the Pacific.
Besides these steam roads, electric trolley lines are making a network of inter-communication
between all parts of King county not only, but reaching out into the adjoining counties.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

SEATTLE is the county seat and great metropolis of King county and the state, with a population
crowding, if not exceeding, 275,000 people. It covers the hills and lowlands surrounding Elliot
bay, an indentation of Puget sound, and a part of the land between the sound and Lake Washington,
a freshwater lake of great beauty paralleling the sound for 23 miles and from one to three
miles wide. It also includes two smaller lakes, whose sloping shores are covered with the homes
of its citizens. From its hills the snow-capped mountains of the Cascade and Olympic ranges
and Mount Rainier's towering peak are visions of surpassing beauty. A constant stream of coming
and going water craft from all quarters of the globe frequent its harbor. Its business buildings
of brick, stone, iron and concrete tower heavenward over four avenues, and many cross streets
and miles of its low lands are [Page 64] covered with railroad tracks, warehouses and manufacturing
plants.

Its grammar schools, high schools, and State University are equipped with magnificent buildings
and grounds. Its streets and homes are brilliantly lighted with electricity from its own power
plants, while the purest water, sufficient for a million people, flows through its water mains,
all owned and controlled by the city.

A multitude of factories are providing a small part of the merchandise and composes the groundwork
of her commerce.

The shores of Elliot bay are lined with wharves accommodating the largest sea-going ships.
Its last assessed valuation of property was $203,168,680, and its tax to be raised $975,210.

More than 150 miles of street-car tracks are within her borders and a nickel pays for a 15-mile
ride.

GEORGETOWN, in the southern part of Seattle, but not a part of it as yet, has a population
of about 5,000, and is an important manufacturing center. Here are the car shops of Seattle
Electric Company, gas works, foundries, breweries, machine shops, brick and tile works and
many other industries.

RENTON, ISSAQUAH, RAVENSDALE, BLACK DIAMOND, and NEW CASTLE are coal mining towns.

KENT, AUBURN, KIRKLAND, VASHON, NORTH BEND, TOLT, FALL CITY, and MAPLE VALLEY are agricultural
towns of importance.

KITSAP COUNTY

Kitsap county is nearly surrounded by the waters of Puget sound and Hood's canal, forming the
larger part of the great peninsula which these waters would make an island were a six-mile
ridge in Mason county opened up to them. It has extensive and numerous bays and inlets, with
magnificent anchorage, and contains in its center the great Port Orchard navy yard, destined
to become one of the largest seats in the United States for Uncle Sam's naval activities.

RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES.

The chief resource of the county is in the lumber. Some of the largest mills of the state are
located within its borders.

It is estimated that there are yet 200,000 acres of uncut timber in its borders, and its mills
are turning out 600,000 feet of lumber daily, besides vast quantities of shingles.

The fishing industry now includes oyster culture, which is rapidly becoming very important.
About the county are located many villages supported by the tillage of the soil from its reclaimed
forest lands.

TRANSPORTATION.

Kitsap county has no railroads, but its waterways are so vast and intricate that all its corners
are reached by steamers, and travel is cheap and freight conveniently handled in all parts
of the county.

[Page 65] PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

PORT ORCHARD, the county seat, is on the bay of the same name and opposite the navy yard. It
is the chief distributing point for a larger part of the cultivated lands of the county, and
exports not only agricultural products, but also shingles. The surrounding lands are well suited
for dairying, fruit-growing and poultry-raising, which is also true of the entire county.

BREMERTON, adjoining the navy yard, is the largest town in the county, having about 4,000 people
and rapidly growing. It has a fire department, electric light and water systems, newspapers,
banks, about 1,000 or more wage-earners and is a hustling town.

CHARLESTON is another smaller town adjoining the navy yard on the west and rapidly growing.

PORT BLAKELEY is an important milling and shipbuilding town of nearly 2,000 people, opposite
Seattle. Its lumber goes to all parts of the world.

PORT GAMBLE is a sawmill town of importance contributing to swell the large output of lumber
shipped out of the county.

CHICO, TRACYTON, KEYPORT, PAULSBO, SEABECK, CRYSTAL SPRINGS, COLBY, BANGOR, BURLEY, PORT MADISON,
and OLALLA are all small villages, making progress as agricultural centers and as furnishing
summer homes for business men.

KITTITAS COUNTY

Kittitas county is located about in the center of the state, and takes in the upper reaches
and most of the watershed of the Yakima river. It has a population of about 20,000 in an area
of 2,400 square miles. On its northwestern side it is bordered by two ranges of the Cascade
mountains, while its southwestern side lies on the Columbia river.

Among the sources of the Yakima river are three large lakes, Keechelus, Kachess and Cle-Elum,
most beautiful bodies of mountain water and the sources of the great irrigation systems now
fathered by the national government and making the Yakima valley a veritable garden pot of
orchards and vegetables, grasses and flowers.

RESOURCES.

The central portion of the county is a valley comprising 250,000 acres, about one-fourth of
which is under irrigation, and has long been noted for its prolific crops of hay and many herds
of dairy cows.

The foothills of the mountains have precious metals, coal and iron. The streams abound in trout
and much game is in the mountains.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific and Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railroads, coming into the county from
the south and west, cross at Ellensburg [Page 66] and then follow the valley of the Yakima
to the crest of the Cascades giving abundant facilities for making markets east and west to
all parts of the country.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

ELLENSBURG, the county seat, is situated on a level bench in the Yakima valley and on the railroads.
It is a town of upwards of 5,500 people, and is substantially built, chiefly of brick. There
are creameries, flourmills, sawmills, and warehouses, banks, breweries newspapers, electric
lights, and gravity water system, churches, schools, among which is one of the state normal
schools. It is also a division point on the Northern Pacific railway, and is the chief distributing
point in the county for farm products and merchandise.

ROSLYN is the chief coal-mining town, situated on the railroad well up in the foothills of
the mountains. It has about 4,500 people. It has gravity water and electric lights, and is
a substantial, thriving and growing town. From the coal mines in the vicinity the best coals
of the state are mined in large quantities and shipped all over the state.

CLEELUM is another coal mining town, on the Northern Pacific railway, with a population of
about 2,500. Tributary to Cle-Elum is a wide mining territory, for which it is the chief distributing
point.

THORPE is a smaller village likely to develop into an important trading point.

KLICKTAT COUNTY

Klickitat county is central among the southern tier of counties of the state, bordering 80
miles on the Columbia river, with an average width of 20 miles. It has a population of about
14,000 and an area of 1,800 square miles.

There is a great variety in its climate, the elevation varying from 100 to 3,500 feet above
the sea level.

The soil is chiefly volcanic ash, disintegrated basalt and alluvium. It is deep and much of
it sub-irrigated. The principal crops are wheat, barley, rye, oats, and corn.

The wheat lands yield from 15 to 40 bushels per acre.

Among the fruits raised are apples, peaches, pears, cherries, English walnuts, almonds, plums,
prunes, grapes, apricots, and all the small fruits.

Wheat lands vary in price from $10 to $50 per acre. It is estimated that 7,000 acres will be
planted to fruit and nut trees this current year, while last year 75,385 apple trees, 14,675
peach trees, and 17,345 grape vines were planted.

RESOURCES.

As already indicated, the strength of the county is in its soil and agriculture is its great
source of wealth. Stock-raising is a chief industry, the slopes of the mountains on its northern
boundary furnishing [Page 67] abundant pasturage. The southeastern part is fast developing
into a fruit-growing region, while agriculture and grain-growing is more general in the central
and southern portion.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Columbia river, with a railroad on each side of it and numerous ferries, makes ample provision
for transportation, while the Goldendale branch reaches well up into the center of the county.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

GOLDENDALE, the county seat and metropolis, is located in the center of the county, 120 miles
east of Portland. It is the terminus of the Goldendale branch of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle
railway, making connection with the main line at Lyle. It is located in the heart of a splendid
agricultural section and at the edge of the great timber belt.

WHITE SALMON, located in the splendid fruit section, is a thriving town. It is an important
railroad point on the North Bank and is the outlet for the products of an extensive fruit,
timber and dairying region.

CLIFFS, the division point of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle railway, is the trading center
of many square miles of territory. The best nut land in the county is located near here.

BICKLETON, the trading point of an extensive wheat section, is in the eastern part of the county.
An electric road has been surveyed, which will, when completed, give this town railway connection.

LYLE, ROOSEVELT, COLUMBUS, BINGEN, and CENTERVILLE are growing trading points.

LEWIS COUNTY

Lewis county is one of the largest counties in western Washington, having an area of 2,593
square miles of territory and about 40,000 people. It occupies a large part of the drainage
basins of two large rivers, the Cowlitz and Chehalis--one emptying its waters into the Columbia
river and the other into Grays harbor. It reaches from the peaks of the Cascades 100 miles
toward the ocean, but is cut off 30 miles from the coast, and is about 30 miles wide. Mount
Rainier is just north of its extreme eastern portion and about one-fourth of the county is
within the Rainier forest reserve.

RESOURCES.

At present the chief industry of the county consists of manufacturing its forests into the
various forms of lumber and its products, the lumber cut aggregating four hundred million feet
and two hundred million shingles.

Next in importance probably are the precious metal and coal deposits of the county, which have,
however, been but little developed. The coal measures include bituminous, lignite and anthracite,
and are of great extent in the foothills of the eastern part of the county. Two systems of
railroads have been projected into these fields, and the nearest, carrying lignite and bituminous
coals, are being commercially developed. [Page 68]

Agriculture, including especially dairying and fruit culture, takes the place of the forests
as they are removed and bids fair to reach in importance, in time, the lumber and coal resources.
To this end, the soil fertility, the mild climate and cool mountain waters conspire.

TRANSPORTATION.

Lewis county is in the path of all railroads coming in from the south or through the Columbia
gap in the Cascades. Already the Northern Pacific railway and the Union Pacific railway cross
the county, and the North Coast contemplates traversing the entire Cowlitz valley, while the
Tacoma Eastern is already into the northwestern part of the county on its way toward the same
goal. The county cannot be too well supplied, for its vast treasures when developed will furnish
immense products for transportation.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

CHEHALIS and CENTRALIA are the two twin cities of the county--less than five miles apart and
of about equal importance. From Chehalis the Northern Pacific railway branches off, following
the upper reaches of Chehalis river and ending on Willapa bay, while from Centralia the same
road branches, following the lower Chehalis river, to Grays harbor.

CHEHALIS is the county seat, with a population of 5,000 and rapidly growing, and has electric
lights, sanitary sewerage system, paved streets, fine business blocks, and a large and growing
trade. Near the city is located the State Training School.

CENTRALIA has a population of about 7,000 people, chiefly engaged in running sawmills, shingle
mills, sash and door factories, and other woodworking plants. It has a large city hall, ten
churches, fine schools, banks, business houses, water systems, fire department, and is a hustling,
thriving town.

WINLOCK is a town of 1,200 people on the railroad in the southern part of the county, and a
distributing point of much importance.

PE ELL is a town of 1,000 people on the South Bend branch of the Northern Pacific railway,
chiefly engaged in milling and agricultural pursuits.

MCCORMICK, LITTELL, KOSMOS, LITTLE FALLS, ADNA, DRYAD, DOTY, and KOPIAH, are all centers of
industry in various parts of the county.

Lewis county as a whole offers wonderful opportunities for newcomers in all pursuits--commercial,
agricultural, and mining.

[Page 69] LINCOLN COUNTY

Lincoln county, adjoining Spokane county on the west, is one of eastern Washington's great
granaries. Its northern boundary is defined by the Columbia and Spokane rivers. The bulk of
its lands are rolling prairies of great fertility. It has about 2,300 square miles of territory
and about 25,000 people.

TOPOGRAPHY.

The bulk of the county consists of the rolling prairie land characteristic of the great wheat
belt of the state. There are some mineral lands in the northern part of the county and here
and there will be found considerable stretches of timber. In its northern portion the county
is well watered by the Columbia and Spokane rivers, while in the southwestern section and elsewhere
numerous small creeks and lakes occur.

RESOURCES.

The great resource of Lincoln county is its wheat fields, which in 1907 produced to exceed
8,000,000 bushels. Other cereals and hay are important crops. Along its northern part, particularly
on the bottom lands of the rivers, much fruit is grown, including peaches and all the small
fruits. Diversified farming is growing in favor among the farmers. Compared with other counties
of the state, Lincoln county ranks as follows in the number of its stock: Horses, second place;
hogs, second place; cattle, sixth place. The county also stands fourth in the number of its
school houses and spends annually $100,000 for school support.

In wealth per capita, Lincoln county leads the state, showing for assessment purposes an average
holding of real estate of $1,163 and $226 in personalty.

TRANSPORTATION.

The county is traversed from west to east its entire length by the Great Northern and the central
Washington branch of the Northern Pacific railroads, some distance from its side lines, so
that very little of the county is more than 12 miles from a railroad shipping point. There
are 170 miles of railroad tracks in the county.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

DAVENPORT, the county seat and largest town in the county, is situated on the central Washington
branch of the Northern Pacific railway near the middle eastern portion of the county, and has
a population of about 2,800 people. Its business blocks are chiefly built of brick. It owns
its own water system, is lighted with electricity, has fine school buildings and churches.
Its court house cost about $80,000. It is surrounded by splendid farms and annually ships out
about 1,250,000 bushels of wheat.

[Page 70] WILBUR, a town of 1,500 people, on the Northern Pacific railway, is a very important
shipping and distributing center. It has large flour mills, warehouses, five churches, and
schools, electric lights, and water system, bank, newspaper, parks, and important commercial
institutions.

ALMIRA, in the western part of the county, on the Northern Pacific railway, is another prosperous
and growing grain center with about 600 people.

HARRINGTON, on the Great Northern railway, is a town of some 1,200 people. It has a beautiful
location, commands the trade of a large farming county, ships grain and livestock, and is a
prosperous and growing town.

CRESTON, EGYPT, and BLUESTEM are smaller growing commercial centers.

MASON COUNTY

Mason county lies on the upper reaches of Puget sound, having the Olympic mountains at its
north, where about one-fourth of the county is in the Olympic forest reserve. Its total area
is about 900 square miles, and it has a population of about 6,000. Hood's canal penetrates
well into the center of the county in its great bend, giving it a very long salt-water shore
line. From the Olympic mountains numerous streams flow into the Puget sound, while others empty
their waters into Gray's harbor.

The county is a great forest of splendid timber, which has been only to a limited degree cut
out. The soil of the foothills and valleys Is composed chiefly of shot clays and alluvial deposits,
making good farming, stock-raising and fruit-growing lands.

RESOURCES.

Logging and its allied industries constitute the main industries of the county, Much of the
logs are shipped out of the county to feed sawmills in other parts of the Sound.

Raising and marketing oysters is an important source of wealth to the county.

There is already considerable acreage for farming and stock-raising, stock finding pasturage
the year round. This industry will grow as the land is cleared.

The county affords splendid hunting and fishing in season.

TRANSPORTATION.

The county is so cut into by the inlets and bays of the sound that it has splendid transportation
facilities by steamer to all the sound ports. The Northern Pacific railway reaches its southern
boundary. No other railroads traverse the county but its logging railroads, which can give
only a limited service.

[Page 71] PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

SHELTON is the county seat, situated on an arm of the sound at the terminus of the logging
railroad, and has about 1,200 inhabitants. Steamers from its wharves reach all the parts of
the sound directly or by connection with others.

The logging industry, manufacturing lumber, cultivating oysters, fishing and farming are the
chief industries of its people. It has four churches, good schools, a newspaper, good stocks
of goods, volunteer fire department, electric lights, gravity water system.

The logging industry, which centers here, employs 2,000 men and pays out $120,000 a month.

LAKE CUSHMAN is a summer resort in the mountains famous for its big trout catches.

ALLYN, on an arm of the sound, is central to much oyster lands, logging camps and fruit orchards.

ARCADIA, also on the sound, is central to considerable stock-raising and lumbering.

DETROIT is a prosperous village, proud of the grapes grown on some of its logged-off lands.

MATLOCK is a town on the logging railroad and central to large logging operations.

OKANOGAN COUNTY.

Okanogan, the largest county in the state, lies on the northern boundary just east of the Cascade
peaks. It has an area of 4,500 square miles and a population estimated at 13,000.

About one-fourth of the county, a district of great latent resources, is still within the Colville
Indian reservation, but is soon to be thrown open to settlement.

RESOURCES.

This county is endowed with great natural resources and a delightful climate, and is destined
to become thickly populated.

The mountains and their foothills have large and numerous veins of metals and are covered also
with extensive forests. The rolling hills of the south and center are rich in agricultural
possibilities, suitable for stock, and great crops of cereals and fruits. The Okanogan river
and its branches drain the greater portion of the county, rising in British Columbia and flowing
south through the center of the county and joining the Columbia river on the south boundary.
The Methow river drains a large portion of the western part and makes a paradise for the frontiersman
along its sloping sides.

TRANSPORTATION.

Until now the rivers and wagon roads are the only paths of commerce. But into this blossoming
empire the railroads are looking with longing eyes. The Great Northern, however, has already
tapped the [Page 72] northern boundary and projected a line down the Okanogan and Columbia
rivers to Wenatchee. Other railroads will follow, as the prize is too great not to be divided.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

CONCONULLY, the county seat, is situated among the foothills and mines west of the Okanogan
river. In addition to the mining industry, the raising of sheep and cattle is followed by the
citizens. The town has a population of about 500 people.

OROVILLE is the chief town on the railroad, near the northern border, and is the terminus of
the road. It has about 500 people and is growing. It is an important ore-shipping point, surrounded
also by good fruit-raising and agricultural lands, yet unirrigated.

BREWSTER, at the junction of the Columbia and Okanogan rivers, has a population of about 200,
and is an important grain and fruit-shipping point.

OKANOGAN is on the river of the same name, about midway between Brewster and Conconully, and
to this point the steamers ply in the higher waters of the river.

TWISP is a growing village in the Methow valley, devoted chiefly to fruit-growing and mining.
It is an important distributing center.

PATEROS has steamer connection with Wenatchee, and is an importing, growing center.

BECK, BONAPARTE, ANGLIN and BODIE are other new and growing commercial centers.

CHESAW, in the northern part, and NESPELIM, in the southeastern part, are important locations.

PACIFIC COUNTY.

Pacific county is the extreme southern county, which borders on the ocean at the mouth of the
Columbia river. Although a small county with only 900 square miles, it has about 100 miles
of salt-water frontage. Willapa harbor, at the northwest, is capable of being made accessible
to all ocean ships, while Shoalwater bay, a body of water 20 miles long and separated from
the ocean by a long slim peninsula, furnishes probably the best breeding ground In the state
for oyster culture. The county at large is an immense forest, in the center of which is a range
of hills dividing the watershed so that some of the streams flow into the Columbia river at
the south, some west into Willapa harbor, and others, through the Chehalis river, reach Grays
harbor.

RESOURCES.

As already indicated, its timber and its fisheries are the great sources of wealth for the
county, although stock-raising, dairying, fruit-growing and general farming are constantly
growing in importance. [Page 73] The county probably has eleven billion feet of standing timber,
and daily cuts with its 64 sawmills about 775,000 feet of lumber and one million shingles.

Both native and cultivated oysters are largely marketed, as are also clams, crabs, shrimp and
fish. A splendid market for all farm products is afforded by the mills and lumber camps and
summer campers on the beach.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific railway reaches Willapa harbor, cutting the county centrally east and
west. On the long ocean beach from the mouth of the Columbia river northward is a railroad
about 20 miles long, made profitable by the extensive patronage of the summer campers. Added
to these are the water crafts which frequent the harbor and the Columbia river, and altogether
make access to all parts of the county easy.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

SOUTH BEND, the county seat, situated near the mouth of the Willapa river, is a rapidly growing
town of 3,000 people and destined to become an important ocean port. The harbor is capacious,
well protected, has fine anchorage, and is handicapped only by a few feet of mud at the bottom,
which Uncle Sam will soon remove. At low tide there is now from 20 to 30 feet of water in the
channel of the river and at South Bend it is 1,000 feet wide. South Bend is the terminus of
the Northern Pacific railway. It has electric lights, water works, good schools, fine churches,
bank, sawmills, planing-mills, sash and door factories, fish canneries, newspapers, etc., and
is about to build a $50,000 courthouse.

RAYMOND, a new manufacturing town on the harbor and railroad, a few miles from South Bend,
has 2,500 people and is rapidly growing in importance. Raymond is not yet five years old; has
a monthly payroll of $100,000; sawmills and factories representing an invested capital of $4,900,000,
employing 1,200 men; an electric light plant; a city telephone system, owned by local capital;
a salt-water fire protection system; is about to build two bridges, costing $30,000 each, and
is adding new manufacturing plants at the rate of one a month. The city gives free factory
sites, and has both rail and ocean transportation from factory locations to the markets of
the world.

ILWACO is a fishing post of importance near the southwest shore of the county, with 900 population.

CHINOOK, FRANKFORT and KNABTON are other fishing points on the Columbia river of importance.
NAHCOTTA is an ocean summer resort.

[Page 74] PIERCE COUNTY.

Pierce county, though not the largest, is one of the most important counties in the state.
Its area of 1,800 square miles occupies much of the upper reaches of Puget sound on both sides
and extends southeasterly, taking in the Rainier National Park of 2,225,000 acres, and Mount
Rainier (Tacoma) 14,526 feet above sea level and less than 60 miles from salt water, covered
with eternal snow, an endless scene of majestic grandeur, giving the county a greater variety
of elevations and more beautiful and startling scenery than any other county in the United
States. Its northeastern boundary is the White river, its southwestern boundary the Nisqually
river. It has about 125 miles of salt-water shore lands, with innumerable bays and inlets and
several important islands. Originally one vast forest, much of it now is covered with fruitful
fields of grain, grass and orchards.

Its climate is mild and salubrious, its soils of great variety and fertility, and its mountains
and foothills full of coal and precious metals.

RESOURCES.

The resources of Pierce county are varied and of great value. Its central part is one great
coal field, covered with forests, producing annually about 1,000,000 tons of coal. Gold, silver
and copper are among its precious metals, but not extensively mined as yet.

Its rivers possess almost immeasurable water power. One plant on the Puyallup river at Electron
has an ultimate capacity of 40,000 horse-power, 20,000 horse-power of which is now in use.
The city of Tacoma is engaged in the construction of a plant on the Nisqually for municipal
use, the capacity of which will be 20,000 horse-power. The 12,000 horse-power plant at Snoqualmie
Falls also furnishes current for city lighting, street railway and manufacturing purposes in
Tacoma.

All the cereals are successfully raised; dairying is one of the most important industries;
fruit-growing, particularly in small fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries,
cherries, etc., is very profitable and is engaging a great deal of attention. Fish are caught
in quantities and shipped to eastern markets, but Pierce county's greatest natural wealth is
in its vast forests. An idea of the value can be had when it is said that $6,000,000 worth
of lumber was cut in 1908 in Tacoma alone. In addition to these great natural resources, Pierce
county's commercial industries are so great as to place it in the front rank of counties of
the Northwest. The great sawmills, woodworking plants and factories of various kinds in the
city of Tacoma alone employ 11,800 people, and the value of their output last year amounted
to over $43,000,000.00.

TRANSPORTATION.

Pierce county is fast becoming a network of transcontinental railroads centering in Tacoma,
which, coupled with the steamboat traffic on the Sound, gives the county splendid traffic facilities.
Pierce county [Page 75] for years was a non-competitive railroad point, the Northern Pacific
being the only road to enter its vast fields of wealth. Within the last two years, however,
the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Union Pacific system, and the Great Northern, realizing
the wealth of the county and the importance of Tacoma as a manufacturing center, the value
of her perfect harbor for shipping, the vastness of her great stretch of level tidelands for
factory sites and terminal yards, and the low cost at which freight can be transferred from
the rails to the sails or vice versa, have entered the field and are now spending $11,000,000
on construction and terminal work in the city of Tacoma. The addition of these new roads means
a wonderful impetus to the trade of Tacoma. The Tacoma Eastern railroad, a beautiful scenic
route, beginning at Tacoma, runs in a southeasterly direction through a wonderfully fertile
country and vast forests of splendid timber, to Rainier National Park and Mount Rainier (Mt.
Tacoma). Several trolley lines are in operation, reaching all the near-by towns and connecting
Tacoma and Seattle.

In addition to these lines, many steamboats and crafts of all kinds, plying the waters of Puget
Sound and the Pacific ocean, find abundant wharfage and anchorage in the harbor of Tacoma.
The products of the world in large quantities pass through Tacoma in process of distribution.
A constant stream of small crafts, running about the waters of the county, accommodate the
local traffic.

CITIES AND TOWNS.

TACOMA, with a population of about 125,000, is the county seat of Pierce county, and situated
on Commencement bay. Its harbor, one of the finest in the world, and its railroad terminals,
unexcelled on the Pacific Coast, as already indicated, are the center of a vast commerce by
rail and water. At its door is an immense amount of water power, already developed, driving
her street cars and the machinery in many of her factories. Coal and coke are in abundance
within a few miles of the city, the coal being used extensively for steam and conveyed from
the trains to the boats by immense electric bunkers. The coke is largely utilized in the largest
lead and copper reduction plant on the coast. The great Guggenheim smelter at Tacoma reduces
and turns out annually lead, copper, gold and silver worth about $10,000,000. Along her wharves
are immense elevators, grain warehouses and flouring mills. Tacoma yearly ships out more grain
than any other city on Puget sound. In and around the city are large saw and shingle mills,
which last year cut 527,604,000 feet of lumber and 434,000,000 Shingles. Her factories and
shops have $24,000,000 invested and employ 11,800 wage-earners, and her large flour mills ship
their products to all parts of the world. Her packing-house products amounted to $5,000,000
in 1908. The largest car shops west of the Mississippi are located here. Her downtown streets
are lined by large business blocks; she has 185 miles of street and suburban railway, and over
75 miles of paved streets.

[Page 76] There are four daily newspapers, 8 banks, 1,120 acres in parks, and many beautiful
and expensive public buildings. The city hall cost $200,000; the court house, $500,000; her
high school building, the most beautiful on the coast, cost a half million dollars, and the
United States government is completing a $500,000 federal building.

PUYALLUP is one of Pierce county's prosperous towns, having about 7,000 population, in the
wealthy Puyallup valley. This is the center or a great fruit-growing district, in which the
farmers have combined and market their crops through an association, sending their berries
in patent refrigerator cars into far-away markets. It is also quite a large manufacturing center,
with a payroll of $45,000 per month.

BUCKLEY, with a population of 1,500, is the center of large sawmilling, farming and mining
industries.

ORTING is a town with 800 people, chiefly engaged in gardening and farming. The State Soldiers'
Home is located near, and adds considerable trade to the town.

SUMNER has a population of 1,000, is located in the Puyallup valley, and its people form a
part of the farmers' association, engaged in fruit-growing, dairying and gardening.

STEILACOOM is one of the most beautiful little summer resort towns on Puget sound and is connected
with Tacoma by two electric lines.

SYLVAN, GIG HARBOR, ROSEDALE, ELGIN, LONG BRANCH, BLANCHARD, and BEE are very prosperous villages
of Pierce county, and are located on the shores of Puget sound.

SPANAWAY, EATONVILLE, ALDERTON, ELBE, MERIDIAN, KAPOWSIN, and MCMILLAN are villages in the
interior, on the railroads.

WILKESON, SOUTH PRARIE, CARBONADO, FAIRFAX, PITTSBURG, and MELMONT are coal-mining towns of
importance.

SAN JUAN COUNTY.

San Juan county is a group of islands lying between the waters of the Straits of Fuca and the
Gulf of Georgia, off the southeast shore of Vancouver island. It has about 200 square miles
of territory and about 4,500 people.

There are three large islands and several smaller ones. The islands are covered with soil and
timber not different from the main land adjoining. Heavy timber in the forests, fine clay loams
in the bottom lands, shot clay on the hillsides, big ledges of lime rock and other minerals
and great shoals of fish in the waters are the foundations for prosperity for the citizens
of the county.

RESOURCES.

The soils of the islands yield generously to good tillage, and wheat, oats, barley, potatoes
and hay yield large crops. Dairying is profitable. Poultry-raising and fruit-growing, are especially
attractive. Sheep and [Page 77] cattle find splendid pasture. Great quantities of salmon and
other fish are taken in the waters, and game-deer and wild fowl--are abundant.

TRANSPORTATION.

There is no transportation save by water, but the islands are in the way of traffic from so
many different directions that all parts are well served by steamboats.

ISLANDS AND TOWNS.

SAN JUAN ISLAND is the largest of the group, and its chief industries are farming, raising
stock, salmon-fishing, and manufacturing lime.

FRIDAY HARBOR, on this island, is the county seat and largest town, with about 500 people.
A telephone system is in operation throughout the island.

ROCHE HARBOR is the home of great lime kilns.

ORCAS ISLAND is the leading fruit-growing district of the county.

EAST SOUND, near the center of the island, at the foot of Mount Constitution, is a picturesque
and charming fruit-growing section and summer resort.

ORCAS is an important center of the fruit and sheep raising industries.

LOPEZ ISLAND is a beautiful stretch of fertile agricultural land, much of it under tillage,
and is the home of a prosperous community of farmers and stock-growers.

LOPEZ is the chief commercial center, with a cannery and creamery.

SKAGIT COUNTY.

Skagit county is the next county to the northwest corner of the state, stretching from Rosario
straits to the peaks of the Cascades--about 100 miles east and west and 24 miles north and
south. Its area is 1,800 square miles, with a population of about 35,000.

It is a county of great diversities in climate, topography and resources. The Skagit river
and its branches drain nearly the entire county from the mountains to the saltwater. Its deltas
are great flat fields of wonderful fertility. Its valleys also, where cleared of forests, are
very rich alluvial lands. Its upper lands carry a great burden of forests and are full of hidden
treasures.

RESOURCES.

The resources of the county are its forests and minerals, its agricultural products, and fishes.
Its great cereal crop is of oats; hops, fruits, hay and barley follow in the order named in
importance, while the products of the dairy are rapidly multiplying. Its minerals include the
precious metals, iron, lead, coal, marble, limestone, granite, sandstone, etc.

[Page 78] TRANSPORTATION.

Aside from its water transportation, the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific railways cross
its westerly end and send a branch line through the valley of the Skagit river well up towards
the mountains and to the salt water at Anacortes. And other roads are building, while there
are 168 miles of modern graveled wagon roads. The facilities for getting about are excellent.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

MT. VERNON is the county seat, with about 4,000 people. It is on the Great Northern railway,
on the navigable Skagit river, and is a city of much commercial importance to the agricultural
district around it. The soil in the vicinity is renowned for its great fertility and astonishing
crops of oats, hay and grass. Creameries and a milk-condensing plant are supported profitably
to all concerned.

ANACORTES is the chief town of the county, on the salt water. It has about 6,000 people, and
is a center of lumbering and fishing. Factories for drying, salting, and canning salmon, halibut,
and cod are increasing industries. There is also a fertilizing plant and a plant producing
charcoal and the by-products of combustion, wood alcohol, turpentine, etc.

SEDRO-WOOLLEY, on both the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railways, has a population of
4,000, engaged in lumber industries, fruit, and vegetables, canning, dairying and gardening.
It has a monthly payroll of $125,000.

BURLINGTON, on the Great Northern railway, has 1,800 people, and factories for making various
wood products, concrete blocks, lumber, shingles and condensed milk.

LA CONNER is a great oat and hay shipping point. It is at the mouth of the Skagit river and
on tide water, and has 800 people.

HAMILTON, at the head of navigation on the Skagit river, is a mining and lumbering town of
300 people.

BAY VIEW, SAMMISH, MINKLER, PRAIRIE, FIR, and BIRDSVIEW are other shipping points.

BAKER, on a branch of the Great Northern railway, has 400 people, and is a center of cement
factories.

[Page 79] SKAMANIA COUNTY.

Skamania county, in the south central part of the state, has its southern boundary on the Columbia
river, with Lewis county to the north. It is chiefly within the forest reserve, and includes
Mount St. Helens on the west and Mount Adams on its eastern border. Altogether it has an area
of 1,636 square miles, chiefly mountainous, and about 3,000 people.

The north fork of the Lewis river drains the most of the mountainous region, while a lot of
small streams drain the southern part, emptying into the Columbia river.

The climate is a mean between that of eastern and western Washington, and is very mild and
salubrious. The soil of the valleys in the region of the Columbia river is very fertile.

RESOURCES.

The chief resource of the county is in its timber and lumber, yet its mineral and agricultural
wealth is becoming better known and appreciated yearly. The fruit raised in its valleys is
of excellent flavor, early in season, and the soil is generous in its yield. Splendid pasturage
in the foothills encourages stock-raising, and fishing in the Columbia river is profitably
followed by some of the citizens.

TRANSPORTATION.

Boats on the Columbia river and a railroad on each side of it are the means of transportation,
and ample for the residents of the county in its southern portion. The coming of the North
Bank railroad has given a decided stimulus to the growth of the county.

DEVELOPMENT.

Skamania county has developed slowly and the bulk of its natural wealth is still practically
untouched. Its minerals, well known to be valuable, are attracting the attention of prospectors,
while the forests, fisheries and farming lands will furnish a competence to hundreds of additional
familles. The scenery, combined with the fishing and hunting afforded, are additional attractions
that will prove alluring to many newcomers.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

STEVENSON, a small town on the Columbia river and railroad, is the county seat and has a population
of about 450.

Tributary to Stevenson is considerable improved land, and the people are engaged in stock-raising,
fruit-growing and farming.

BUTLER is a town of about 300 people on the railroad and river.

CARSON, CAPE HORN, MT. PLEASANT and BEAR PRAIRIE are smaller villages, destined to become centers
of commercial distribution.

[Page 80] SNOHOMISH COUNTY.

Snohomish county extends 36 miles in width from the Sound to the peaks of the Cascade mountains,
adjoining King county on the north. It has an area of some 2,500 square miles of territory,
a population of about 63,000 people, and a great storehouse of wealth in its natural resources.
It is one of the largest and richest counties in the state, with a mild and healthful climate,
magnificent scenery, great diversity of landscape, innumerable water falls and plenty of game.

RESOURCES.

The forests of Snohomish are very extensive and but little depleted. Fir, cedar, hemlock and
spruce are its chief trees. Nearly one-half of the area of the county is heavily mineralized
with veins of gold, silver, copper, lead, nickel, iron, and other ores. There are also vast
ledges of marble, granite and other building stones.

In diversified agricultural possibilities, few counties can excel Snohomish. Its general soils
in its valleys are alluvial, and produce astonishing crops; about the deltas of its rivers,
the riches of the salt water and the mountains have combined to make a soil that will endure
for ages and annually astonish the husbandman with its generosity. Upon its uplands, its clay
and decaying herbage have combined for ages to create a soil wonderfully adapted to produce
grass and fruits, and the industrious are luxuriating in nature's prodigality.

Rainfall is abundant, but not excessive, and crops of the cereals and fruits are never failures.

TRANSPORTATION.

This county is splendidly provided with transportation facilities; many steamboats ply its
salt waters and part way up the three great rivers that flow into the Sound. Two transcontinental
railroads cut the western part of the county in two. The trunk line of the Great Northern follows
the valley of one river from the southeast to the coast, while two branch lines run up the
other two great valleys, past the center of the state, toward the mountains, while a dozen
spurs and short logging and coal roads act as feeders to the main lines, thus giving all the
towns of the county access to all the Sound markets, and those of the east and the ports of
the Pacific ocean.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

EVERETT, situated upon a fine harbor on the shores of Puget Sound near the mouth of the Snohomish
river, is the county seat and metropolis of the county. It has a population of 35,000, and
is fast developing into a commercial and manufacturing center of importance.

The largest steamers afloat can find wharfage at her docks and safe anchorage in her waters.
It has upwards of 3,000 men employed in its factories and mills, with a monthly payroll aggregating
$230,000.

[Page 81] They are engaged in the manufacture of lumber, shingles, sash and doors; in railroad
shops, pulp and paper mills, and smelters; in running tug boats, driving piles, making iron
castings, and tanning hides; packing meats and fish; making turpentine, charcoal, flour, butter,
and many other commodities. Its banks have $4,000,000 on deposit. Its paper mills produce 26
tons of paper daily. Its smelter is a constant producer of the precious metals and their by-products.

The city is substantially built, having all the conveniences of a modern city, with wide streets
and wide sidewalks; has both gas and electricity for lights, and a good water system. Some
of its streets are paved with preserved wooden blocks and some with asphalt.

Everett is a sub-port of entry of the Puget sound country. The United States has spent half
a million dollars improving the mouth of the Snohomish river for a fresh-water harbor.

SNOHOMISH is a city of 4,000 people, on the Snohomish river, which is navigable, and is connected
with Everett by a street car line. It is also on the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railways,
and is the distributing center for a large agricultural district. It has a number of shingle
and sawmills, and is headquarters for a good deal of the mining industry of the county.

STANWOOD is a town of about 800 people, on the Sound and railway, in the northwestern part
of the county. It is a center of farming interests and lumber industries.

ARLINGTON is a mining and lumbering town on the Northern Pacific railway, well up toward the
mountains. It has a population of 2,000 and is growing.

MONROE is a town of 2,400 people, on the line of the Great Northern railway, in the center
of a large farming and milling industry.

EDMONDS, a town of 2,000 people, is on the Sound and Great Northern railway, near the King
county line; chiefly engaged in sawing lumber and making shingles.

SULTAN, GRANITE FALLS, GOLD BAR, DARRINGTON, and MONTE CRISTO are all centers of mining and
other industries.

MARYSVILLE, MUKILTEO, SILVANA, GETCHELL, and PILCHUCK are centers of lumbering and farming.

SPOKANE COUNTY

Spokane county lies in the extreme eastern section of the state. The area of the county is
1,680 square miles.

TRANSPORTATION.

The transportation facilities are the best of the Inland Pacific Northwest. Three transcontinental
railroads--the Northern Pacific, Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, and Great Northern--traverse
the County from east to west; a fourth transcontinental line, the Oregon Railway & Navigation
company, enters from the southwest, and a fifth transcontinental road, the Spokane International
(C. P. R.), enters [Page 82] the county from the northeast and terminates at Spokane. The Spokane
Falls & Northern extends north into British Columbia and to Republic and Oroville, Wash. Electric
trolley lines connect Spokane with the outlying towns in every direction. The total railway
mileage in the county is approximately 429 miles.

TOPOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRIES.

The northern portion of the county is somewhat mountainous, and is covered with a fine growth
of pine and tamarack timber; much of this section is suitable for agriculture, while all is
adapted to grazing. The central part of the county is rolling and is traversed by the Spokane
river; the central section to the west of the city of Spokane is fine agricultural land, while
to the east of Spokane is the Spokane valley, which is rapidly being brought into a high state
of cultivation by means of irrigation. There are about 40,000 acres in this valley capable
of irrigation; 3,000 acres are now irrigated and under cultivation. The southern portion of
the county is rolling, and comprises some of the finest agricultural land in the state. Large
areas of this section are utilized for wheat-raising, while here are grown the finest sugar
beets in the world.

Lumbering is a considerable industry, while stock-raising and dairying are also extensively
engaged in. Over 1,000,000 bushels of wheat are grown annually. The flour mills of the county
have a combined capacity of 3,600 barrels daily.

In fruit-growing Spokane is one of the leading counties of the state. The value of the fruit
produced in the county amounts to nearly $3,000,000 annually. The following table shows the
distribution of the five important fruits.

[Footnote *: Is 25 percent. of the total number of apple trees planted in the state in 1908.]

SCHOOLS.

There are 165 school districts in the county and eighteen towns where graded schools are maintained.
The total valuation of assessed property with improvements (1908) is $77,120,360; personal
property, $10,527,030.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

SPOKANE, situated on the Spokane river, is the county seat of Spokane county, and is the metropolis
of eastern Washington, having a [Page 83] population estimated at 120,000. Spokane is the center
of a great wheat-raising section and is the principal mining and commercial center between
the Cascades and the Rocky mountains. A conservative estimate of the total value of manufactured
products for 1908 is $17,000,000. There are over 12,000 wage-earners, receiving over $10,000,000
annually. The principal industrial establishments are lumber mills, flour mills, machine shops,
agricultural machinery, brick plants, iron works, foundries, pottery, cereal food, furniture, etc.

The industrial prosperity of the city is due largely to the mines in the vicinity, the great
agricultural resources of the surrounding country, and to the extensive water power which offers
special inducements to manufacturers. The Spokane river here has a total fall of 132 feet,
which furnishes a minimum of 33,000 horse-power, of which 15,000 horse-power is developed.

There are four national banks, with a combined capital of $3,425,000. The city owns its own
water works, from which an annual revenue of more than $325,000 is derived.

The educational facilities are excellent. There are twenty-three public school buildings, constructed
of brick and stone, and costing $1,450,000. There are three daily newspapers, having a combined
circulation of 45,000. Here is located the U. S. circuit court; the headquarters of the U.
S. district court, eastern division; U. S. military post (Fort Wright); the government headquarters
of the postal inspector service, known as the Spokane division, which includes the states of
Washington, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and the territory of Alaska, and a U. S. land office. Postoffice
receipts for 1908 amounted to $360,504.

CHENEY, 10 miles southwest of Spokane, is a town of 1,500 people. Here is located one of the
state normal schools, having about 400 students.

MEDICAL LAKE is an important town, having the Eastern Washington Hospital for the Insane near-by,
It is a noted health resort.

ROCKFORD is an important agricultural town of 1,200 people.

HILLYARD is an important place of 1,500 people, having the car shops of the Great Northern
railway as its chief business.

STEVENS COUNTY

Stevens county, in the extreme northeastern corner of the state, has an area of 4,500 square
miles and a population of about 24,000. It is a county of great and diverse resources, is splendidly
watered with large rivers, the Columbia bounding it on the west, and the Spokane on part of
its southern line. Three ranges of low mountains extend across the county nearly north and
south. Between these the Colville river and the Pend d'Oreille flow generally northerly through
grand and beautiful valleys.

[Page 84] RESOURCES AND PRODUCTIONS.

Agriculture in all its branches, lumbering and kindred pursuits, and the mining of precious
metals and building stones make up its chief sources of wealth.

AGRICULTURE.

The farms in the Colville valley are noted for their heavy hay crops, producing abundantly
all the cereals, including corn, the clovers, timothy and alfalfa.

Dairying and stock-raising are important industries. To these the climate and soils are well
adapted. Some lands have been irrigated with great benefit, but the bulk of the farming is
successful without irrigation.

Fruit-raising is receiving deep interest of late, and the county bids fair to compete for honors
with the very best localities in the state for the hardier fruits.

Lumbering and saw-milling engage the attention of a large number of the people, the product
of the mills finding a ready market in the farming region, large cities and mining camps.

Mining of the precious metals is a growing and an attractive industry. The ores include gold,
silver, lead, copper, tungsten and iron, while quarries of limestone, marble, onyx, fire-clay,
etc., abound.

TRANSPORTATION.

In addition to the navigable waters of the Columbia and Pend d'Oreille rivers, which traverse
the outskirts of the county, the Great Northern railway through the Colville valley from the
southern to the northern boundary, reaches most of the agricultural and mining centers and
renders good service. The western part of the county, comparatively undeveloped, deserves much
more attention.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

COLVILLE is both the county seat and principal town in the county, having a population of 1,600
people, and is a growing town, a distributing center on the railroad, surrounded by prosperous
farming communities.

NORTHPORT is the center of much mining activity and has a large smelter for the reduction of
ores of the precious metals. It has a population of 1,200.

CHEWELAH is a center of agriculture, mining and lumbering industries in the center of the county,
having about 1,000 people.

NEWPORT, in the southeastern part of the county, is an important agricultural distributing
center. A dozen other smaller towns offer great opportunities to the homeseeker.

[Page 85] THURSTON COUNTY

Thurston county is known as having the state capital, Olympia, within its borders, and as including
the extreme southern reaches of Puget sound. It is a county of wooded hills and valleys with
a few open prairies well watered by mountain streams, chief of which is the Nisqually, which
forms its dividing line from Pierce county, and the Des Chutes river, which makes a splendid
waterfall of some 85 feet, a few miles south of Olympia. It has an area of about 700 square
miles, 100 miles of salt-water shore, a population of about 20,000, and a delightful climate
and magnificent scenery of lofty mountains; great expanse of inland salt water, and green-clad
islands and fields in every direction.

RESOURCES.

The county is one of the oldest settled portions of the state, and has a great variety of natural
resources, among which are its timber areas, its agricultural fields, its coal mines, its fisheries,
including clam and oyster beds, gray sandstone quarries, and a great variety of clays.

INDUSTRIES.

The sawmills of the county are still a very important industry and shiploads of lumber are
sent out from its wharves. All the cereals and grasses yield abundant crops; root crops are
extensive; fruit of great variety and fine flavor is very prominent. Dairying is flourishing,
the county having more dairies than any other in the state. Coal mining is in its infancy,
but has progressed far enough to demonstrate the existence of vast areas of lignite coal, having
some six veins and having a combined thickness of 61 feet of coal. About 50,000 sacks of oysters
are annually marketed.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Northern Pacific railway connects Olympia with all the important Sound ports and the east,
and all the transcontinental roads coming to the Sound from the south will pass through the
county. Together with its salt-water deep harbors, these give the county splendid competition
and variety of commercial facilities.

PRINCIPAL CITIES.

OLYMPIA, the chief town of the county, at once the county seat, state capital and county metropolis,
is situated on one of the deep-water inlets of Puget sound. Its population is about 12,000.
While it has a beautiful sandstone structure, now used for capitol purposes, the state is about
to erect a new capitol building, to cost $1,000,000. The foundation is already built. Olympia
has one of the U. S. land offices and the U. S. surveyor-general's office. It is lighted and
furnished with power for street-car and other purposes from the power of Tumwater falls. The
city is a beautiful one of fine homes, shaded streets and parks, surrounded by a very prosperous
agricultural community, [Page 86] producing great quantities of fruit, dairy and poultry products.

Several other smaller towns on the railroads are local centers of commercial activity.

WAHKIAKUM COUNTY

Wahkiakum is a small county, having only 275 square miles of territory, located on the Columbia
river in the southwestern corner of the state, near the ocean. Its population is about 4,000.
The county is heavily timbered and well watered. In many parts of the county the soil is exceptionally
fertile. The climate is mild, but somewhat humid. In the northern part are some low mountains,
from which the drainage is south through the county to the Columbia river.

RESOURCES.

The resources of the county consist in its timber, its fertile soil, and the fish in the river
and ocean.

INDUSTRIES.

Logging, saw-milling, and industries growing out of these; agriculture, dairying, and fishing
are the chief occupation of its people. There are several logging concerns in the county and
large saw-mills. Fish canneries dot its river shores; several creameries and dairies are manufacturing
butter, while its farms produce hay, potatoes, fruits, cattle, hogs, poultry, eggs, and other
products, chiefly for the Portland market. Many of its citizens are fishermen and some make
considerable sums trapping fur animals in the winters.

TRANSPORTATION.

The Columbia river is the great highway of the county; no railroads are within its borders
or near. Owing to the small area of the county, this condition is no great drawback, as all
the people have ready access to the river wharves.

PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

CATHLAMET, on the Columbia, is the county seat, with about 500 people, and is the chief distributing
center of the county.

ROSBURG, DEEP RIVER, BROOKFIELD, ALTOONA, and SKAMOKAWA are centers of industry. This county
offers exceptional opportunities for the frontiersman.

WALLA WALLA COUNTY

Walla Walla is the county of many waters. It is the most western of the southeastern counties
of the state, and is bounded north and west by the Snake and Columbia rivers. It has 1,296
square miles and a population of about 30,000. The elevation varies from 350 feet at the Columbia
river to 2,500 feet along its eastern border. It is a succession of plains and rolling hills,
covered with bunch-grass, with some trees along the streams. Its soil varies from quite sandy
volcanic ash in the low lands near the Columbia to a [Page 87] heavier clay loam in the eastern
parts. In common with much of eastern Washington, these lands increase in fertility with successive
cultivations. The climate is mild, healthful and vigorous.

RESOURCES.

Walla Walla county is essentially agricultural. Its chief resource is its soil fertility. This
is such that few farmers can be found who have not bank accounts.

PRODUCTS.

The annual production of wheat in Walla Walla county is about 5,000,000 bushels. Barley is
also a profitable crop. Oats and some corn are also raised. Large crops of alfalfa hay are
annually marketed, chiefly from irrigated lands. Fruit of all kinds is abundant. There are
2,500 acres devoted to orchards. Market gardening is an important and growing industry.

TRANSPORTATION.

There are 310 miles of railroads in this county, both the Northern Pacific and Oregon Railroad
& Navigation Company railroads competing for the traffic. In addition to the railroads, steamboats
are plying the rivers around the edge of the county, giving additional facilities for transportation.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

WALLA WALLA, the county seat, has a population of about 22,000 and is the commercial center
for the southeastern part of the state. Its streets are paved. The city owns its own system
of water, at a cost of $600,000. It is lighted with electricity and gas, has large banks and
business houses, U. S. land office, U. S. courts, U. S. cavalry post, an Odd Fellows' home,
and a Home for Widows and Orphans. There are manufacturing industries employing 400 men, turning
out $2,000,000 of productions annually. An electric system of street cars traverses the streets
and is projected into several other near-by towns.

WAITSBURG is an important agricultural town of about 1,600 people, in the western part of the
county, having both railroad systems, and ships great quantities of grain. It has large flouring
mills, warehouses, fine schools and churches, and is a prosperous, thriving town.

A large number of shipping points on both systems of railroads are growing commercial centers.

WHATCOM COUNTY

Whatcom county lies on the boundary of British Columbia, stretching from the Straits of Georgia
to the peaks of the Cascade mountains--24 miles wide and 100 miles long, The eastern half or
more of the county is included in the national forest reserve, with Mount Baker, 10,827 feet
high, in the center of the county. It is one of the important counties on tide water, and has
an area of 2,226 square miles and a population of about 70,000.

[Page 88] The climate is not different from the general Puget sound climate being mild and
healthful. There are no severe storms, no sultry heat and no severe cold.

RESOURCES.

It is estimated that Whatcom county has three billion feet of standing timber. This is its
greatest source of wealth. The western half of the county, outside of the lumbering, etc.,
is blessed with a wealth of soil responding to the farmer's labor generously.

The eastern half of the county is essentially a mountainous, forest-covered mining region,
and has in store many veins of nearly all the metals.

Game of great variety of animals and fowls and fish are abundant.

INDUSTRIES.

The people of Whatcom county are engaged in lumbering and running saw-mills, one of the largest
of the state being in this county; manufacturing of various kinds from the raw products in
the county, including shingle mills and shingle machinery factory, salmon canneries, planing
mills, barrel factories, Portland cement factory, and many others. Of no small importance is
farming, fruit-growing and dairying. Prospecting and mining engage the attention and labor
of a large number of citizens.

TRANSPORTATION.

Aside from having a long salt-water coast, open to traffic from the ocean, with splendid harbors,
the county is traversed in all its agricultural half by a network of railroads, by the Northern
Pacific, Great Northern, B. B. and B. C. railroads. These furnish exceptional means of traffic
to all industries excepting the mining. The county has also an admirable system of wagon roads,
some planked, some graveled and some graded and drained, covering about 700 miles.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

BELLINGHAM, on a salt-water bay of the same name, is the county seat, and commercial metropolis
not only for this county but much other territory. It has a population of about 40,000 people.
Into it all the railroads center, while the harbor is one of the best in Washington. It is
largely a manufacturing town, having plants for the production of sash, doors, columns, tin
cans, boilers, engines, flour and feed, canned fish, condensed milk, and many others. It is
a substantial, live business community of wide-awake people, and growing rapidly. It has a
gravity water system, electric lights, and gas plant.

BLAINE is a city of about 3,000 inhabitants, situated close to the Canadian line and on the
Great Northern railway. Timber and lumber manufactures are the chief sources of its prosperity.
Fishing and the canning of salmon are also important industries. The railroad [Page 89] company
has recently expended considerable sums in improving its facilities. Blaine is a growing community.

SUMAS, on the Canadian border, is a lumbering town of 1,100 people.

LYNDEN is an agricultural center of 1,200 citizens.

FERNDALE is a lumber center of 1,000 people. Besides, there are a dozen smaller business centers
in the county, growing and prosperous.

WHITMAN COUNTY

Whitman county is one of the chief agricultural counties of the state, lying immediately south
of Spokane county and on the Idaho state line, having the Snake river for its southern boundary.
The county is a plateau of rolling prairie lands, a large portion of which is farmed, watered
by a number of streams, which are utilized for irrigation purposes in some of the bottom lands--although
the rainfall is sufficient to mature crops, and no irrigation is had on the great bulk of the
farms. The area is about 2,000 square miles. The population is about 40,000. The soil is a
strong mixture of volcanic ash and clay of great fertility and permanence. Twenty years of
wheat-growing still leaves the soil able to produce from 25 to 50 bushels per acre.

RESOURCES.

All the resources of the county originate in this splendid soil. For growing all the cereals
and fruits and vegetables it has no superior. The county is well settled, and probably no county
can excel Whitman county in the per capita wealth of its farmers. The products of the county
are varied, and include wheat, oats, barley and hay, all giving splendid yields--wheat from
30 to 50 bushels, oats 60 to 100 bushels, barley from 50 to 80 bushels, and hay from 4 to 6
tons per acre. Potatoes, sugar beets and other vegetables produce fine crops.

The hardier fruits, such as apples, pears, plums and cherries, are successfully raised in all
parts of the county, while on the bottom lands, along the Snake river, peaches, melons, etc.,
are produced in abundance. Seventy-five carloads of fruit go out annually from one orchard.

Wheat gives up five and one-half million bushels to the farmers each year. Oats one and three-fourths
million and barley about one-half million bushels. Whitman county has more banks than any county
in eastern Washington besides Spokane.

TRANSPORTATION.

Whitman county is as well, or better, provided with railroads than any agricultural county
in the state. The Northern Pacific, O. R. & N., Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul and the S. &
I. railroads are all interlaced about its grain-fields. These all connect with Spokane, and
give access to all eastern and western markets.

[Page 90] PRINCIPAL TOWNS.

COLFAX, the county seat, situated near the center of the county, on the railroads and Palouse
river, is the largest town in the county, with about 3,600 population. The town owns its own
water system, has electric lights, fine court-house, banks, mills, warehouses, etc.

PULLMAN is a town of 3,000 people, near which is located the Washington State College, a large
educational institution supported by the state, having about 1,000 students. It is an important
grain-shipping point. It has a public water system, electric lights, and is a thriving and
growing commercial center.

PALOUSE is a railroad center of 2,500 people, a large shipping point for grain, live stock,
fruits and pottery.

OAKESDALE is a town of 1,500 people, having three railroads, and is an important shipping point.

TEKOA has a population of about 1,400, is a railroad center, and is a large shipper of fruits
and grain.

GARFIELD has a population of 1,000, and ships much grain and other produce.

ROSALIA has 1,000 population, and is an important grain center.

This county has a dozen other shipping points where from 300 to 700 people are supported by
the business originating on the tributary farms.

YAKIMA COUNTY

Yakima county is one of the large and important counties in the state, having the Yakima Indian
reservation included within its boundaries. Its area is 3,222 square miles and it has a population
of about 38,000. It is watered by the Yakima river and its tributaries, and through its valleys
the railroads from the east find their easiest grade toward the Cascade passes. It is a county
of level valleys and plateaus, having a soil made up chiefly of volcanic ash and disintegrated
basaltic rocks, of great depth, which yields fabulously in cereal and grass crops, fruits and
vegetables with the magic touch of irrigation. Artificial watering is 30 years old in this
valley, and yet only a very small area was thus treated until the matter was taken up by the
national government. But now vast areas are being provided with water, and the consequent growth
and development of the county is wonderful.

A series of lakes in the mountains are being utilized as reservoirs, and from these lakes the
waters are being distributed in many directions in the large irrigating canals. When the projects
now under way are completed, more than 200,000 acres will be under ditches.

RESOURCES.

Yakima's wealth consists in the combination of its soil and water and climate. The county,
lying east of the Cascade mountains, in [Page 91] large part at a low elevation, receives somewhat
severe heat in the summer, which gives the opportunity successfully to ripen the less hardy
fruits--peaches, apricots, grapes, etc. The county has half a million bearing trees and two
and one-half million young trees growing in its orchards.

INDUSTRIES.

Naturally the industries of the county consist in exploiting its natural resources, and so
we find Yakima citizens busy in raising fruits, hay, grain, and garden vegetables, to supply
the big cities of the Sound. Its last year's contribution will probably exceed ten million
dollars in value.

Of the items which compose this large sum, fruit is probably chief in importance. Alfalfa and
grain-hay is an important item, as is also the crop of melons and potatoes. The combined fields
of alfalfa and orchards make ideal bee pasturage, and Yakima honey is a constant factor of
barter in the Sound cities. The upland farms produce quantities of all grains--wheat, oats,
and barley--and some field corn is successfully raised in the warmer parts. Sheep, cattle and
horses are also exported. Hops are a large crop.

PRINCIPAL CITIES AND TOWNS.

NORTH YAKIMA is at once the county seat and chief metropolis of the entire Yakima valley, having
a population of about 12,000. It is situated on the Northern Pacific railway and Yakima river,
and is the distributing center for both merchandise and farm products for a large surrounding
territory.

The State Fair, supported by the state, holds annual exhibits here. It has extensive fruit
canneries, flour mills, lumber mills, other woodworking factories, large warehouses, paved
streets, big business blocks, fine churches, schools, banks, newspapers, etc.

SUNNYSIDE, a town built up among the irrigated farms, has a population of 1,500. Here are a
cannery, pulp mill, creameries, etc.

TOPPENISH and MABTON are commercial centers of importance of about 700 inhabitants each, and
growing.
