COMMUNITY CIVICS AND RURAL LIFE

BY ARTHUR W. DUNN

SPECIALIST IN CIVIC EDUCATION, UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION; AUTHOR OF "THE COMMUNITY
AND THE CITIZEN"

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

This book, like the author's earlier one, The Community and the Citizen, is a "community civics"
text. Two purposes led to the preparation of this second volume. The first was to produce a
text that would meet the needs of pupils and teachers who live outside of the environment of
the large city. Training for citizenship in a democracy is a fundamentally identical process
in all communities, whether urban or rural. But, if it really functions in the life of the
citizen, this process must consist largely in deriving educational values from the actual civic
situations in which he normally finds himself. Moreover, instruction that relates to matters
that lie beyond immediate experience must nevertheless be interpreted in terms of that experience
if it is really to have meaning. At least half of the young citizens of America live in an
environment that is essentially rural. Hence their need for civics instruction that takes its
point of departure in, and refers back to, a body of experience that differs in many ways from
that of the urban citizen.

This does not imply that urban conditions should be ignored in the civic education of the rural
citizen. On the contrary, one of the things that every citizen should be led to appreciate
is the interdependence of country and city in a unified national life. In the present volume
emphasis is given to this interdependence. For this reason, and because of the fundamental
principles which have controlled the development of the text, it is believed that the book
may perform a distinct service even in city schools.

The second purpose in undertaking the present book has been to make as obvious as possible
the elements which, in the author's judgment, characterize "community civics" and give it vitality.
The Community and the Citizen was a pioneer among texts that have sought to vitalize the study
of government and citizenship. The term "community civics" became current only at a later time
to designate the "new civics" which that book represented. It seems to the author, however,
that many teachers and others have seized upon some of the more incidental, even though important,
features of the "new civics" without apparently recognizing its really vital characteristics.

For example, the "new civics" performed a real service in giving emphasis to the study of the
"local community," which was being sadly neglected ten or fifteen years ago. It was this emphasis,
doubtless, that gave rise to the name "community civics." But "local study," even though labelled
"community civics," may be, and often is, entirely lacking in vitalizing features. On the other
hand, the vitalizing methods that should characterize community civics may be applied to the
study of our "national community," and even of the embryonic "world community,"--and should
be so applied in any "community civics" that is worthy of a place in our schools in this critical
period of national and world history. The real significance of the term "community civics"
is to be found in its application to an interpretation of the COMMUNITY-CHARACTER of national
and international life equally with that of town or neighborhood.

Another service that community civics performed was in introducing certain elements of social
or "sociological" study into grades as low as the grammar school. This has sometimes led to
the description of community civics as "elementary sociology." The Community and the Citizen
was perhaps the first "civics" textbook to include such "sociological" material. So far as
that book is concerned, at least, the "sociological" material was included PRIMARILY to afford
a viewpoint from which the better to interpret GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENSHIP. This point seems
often to be missed, with the result that in some schools we find a more or less vitalized "social
study" labelled "community civics," FOLLOWED BY a formal study of government that shows no
obvious, organic relation to the earlier study. Whatever else "community civics" may accomplish,
one of its foremost aims should be TO MAKE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THAT OF THE NATION, MEAN SOMETHING
TO THE YOUNG CITIZEN. In the present book the author has endeavored to keep this aim prominent
in the mind of the teacher. It is hoped that the organic relation of the last few chapters,
which deal explicitly with governmental mechanism and operation, to the earlier chapters will
be obvious.

The underlying, vitalizing features of community civics may be summed up as:

1. THE DEMONSTRATION TO THE YOUNG CITIZEN, BY REFERENCE TO HIS OWN OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE,
OF THE MEANING OF HIS COMMUNITY LIFE (LOCAL AND NATIONAL), AND OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS RELATION
TO THAT LIFE;

2. THE CULTIVATION OF CERTAIN HABITS, IDEALS, AND ATTITUDES ESSENTIAL TO EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION
IN THAT LIFE THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND OTHERWISE.

The aim of the following text is to fix in the pupil's consciousness a few essential ideas,
which will help to determine his ideals and attitudes, by a judicious USE of facts, which will
thereby be more readily remembered and understood. "The most important element of success in
community life ... is TEAM WORK; and team work depends, first of all, UPON A COMMON PURPOSE".
The controlling ideas throughout the following chapters are:

1. The common purposes in our community life;

2. Our interdependence in attaining these common purposes;

3. The consequent necessity for cooperation (team work);

4. Government as a means of securing teamwork for the common good. These ideas are set up in
the first few chapters and exemplified in the remaining chapters. They are easily grasped by
young citizens when DEMONSTRATED by reference to their own observation and experience, which
the text and the accompanying topics seek as far as possible to compel. The last few chapters
contain an analysis of our governmental mechanism which seeks to answer the question, How far
does our government provide the organization, the leadership, and the control over leadership
necessary to secure the teamwork which the preceding chapters have shown to be essential?

The present volume is larger than The Community and the Citizen. The author believes that this
is an advantage, especially for pupils in communities where supplementary materials are not
so easily available. The increased length is due chiefly to the liberal incorporation of concrete
illustrative and explanatory matter. Young students need larger textbooks, provided the additional
matter clothes the skeleton with living flesh.

Whether based on this textbook or some other, however, community civics cannot be successfully
taught if it is made primarily a textbook study. The word "demonstration" has been used advisedly
in the paragraphs above as applied to the ideas to be taught. The text sets up ideas, interprets
and exemplifies them; but "demonstration" can be made only as the pupils draw upon their own
observation and experience. Hence, numerous SUGGESTIVE topics are interspersed throughout to
divert attention from the text and to direct it to the actualities of the pupils' experience.
Even the topics should not be followed literally in every case, but should be diversified to
meet the needs and opportunities of the occasion. But to "omit" such studies as suggested by
the topics is to negate the value of community civics.

The successful teacher will seek to extend the pupil's opportunity to participate in group
activities both within the school and in the community outside, and will make the fullest possible
use of such activities both as a means of demonstrating the operation of the fundamental principles
of civic life, and as a means of cultivating "habits, ideals, and attitudes." "Training for
citizenship through service" is an essential factor in community civics.

"Community civics" has now been quite definitely assigned to the junior high school grades
(see Report of Committee on Social Studies, Bulletin, 1916, No. 28, U.S. Bureau of Education).
While the tendency is toward continuous civics instruction in all of these grades, practice
still varies greatly. The present text has been written in recognition of this variation and
is, in the author's judgment, adapt able to any of the grades in question. If community civics
is placed below the ninth grade, however, the author would suggest its distribution over both
seventh and eighth grades. An outline suggesting a vital coordination between the civics and
the history of these grades, and of particular service in the seventh grade, is given in United
States Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1919, No. 50, Part 3 (a report on Civic Education for
the Schools of Memphis, Tenn.).

It may be added that community civics in the junior high school grades will be vastly more
effective if it is preceded in the six elementary grades by some such course as that outlined
in Citizenship in School and Out (Dunn and Harris, published by D.C. Heath & Company). See
also Lessons in Civics for the Six Elementary Grades of City Schools, by Hannah Margaret Harris
(Bulletin, 1920, No. 18, U.S. Bureau of Education).

A list of "Readings" is appended to each of the following chapters. While it is not expected
that pupils in the grades for which the book is intended will do a great deal of reading outside
of the text, an abundance of illustrative material is desirable and much more easily available,
even for rural schools, than is often appreciated. Let the pupils USE THEIR GOVERNMENT, in
this connection, as freely as possible. A very large part of the references given are to government
publications, many of which can be obtained free of cost directly from the departments issuing
them, and all of which can be had for a nominal cost from the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. Useful publications of the state government and
of state institutions can usually be had for the asking. In ordering from the Superintendent
of Documents the money must be sent in advance (stamps are not accepted). Lists of publications
with the prices may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, or from the several Departments
of the Government.

Frequent reference is made to Lessons in Community and National Life. These are issued in three
pamphlets (Series A, B, and C) by the United States Bureau of Education, at 15 cents per pamphlet.
They contain a large amount of illustrative material. A very few books are referred to in certain
chapters because of their especial value when obtainable. Among these are two collections of
patriotic selections valuable because of their emphasis upon national ideals--Long's American
Patriotic Prose (D.C. Heath & Company), and Foerster and Pierson's American Ideals (Houghton
Mifflin Company). Other similar collections will be found useful.

The illustrations of the book, with comparatively few exceptions, are from photographs furnished
by various departments of the United States Government.

EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION

Rural schools, and schools whose pupils have largely a background of rural experience, have
not done as much as they should towards training for citizenship. This is largely because the
text books have failed to interpret citizenship and government in terms of the actual experience
of such pupils, or to stimulate teamwork and leadership in communities with a distinctly rural
background. More over, in city and rural schools alike, there has been failure to emphasize
the interdependence of rural and urban communities in a single national enterprise. Community
Civics and Rural Life is planned to meet these deficiencies.

There has been too much TALKING ABOUT citizenship in school, and too little LIVING it from
day to day. Training for citizenship necessitates its daily practice in school and out. In
the hands of an able teacher, Community Civics and Rural Life should point the way to real
community living, both now and in the future. It should teach the pupils what their real civic
responsibilities are as well as their civic opportunities--and assist them to embrace them
when they come. Children so trained will learn to respect, now and later, the rights of their
neighbors, and will become as fair in their dealings with the government as with their fellowmen.
They will furnish their communities with the right kind of leaders, unselfish and public spirited.
When the time calls, they will be ready to accept and shed a new dignity upon the old positions
of school trustee, highway engineer, sanitary inspector, township supervisor, county commissioner,
or the more conspicuous offices of state and national government. Or as plain citizens they
will lend these officials their active support for community and national betterment.

COMMUNITY CIVICS

CHAPTER I

OUR COMMON PURPOSES IN COMMUNITY LIFE

TEAM WORK AND COMMON PURPOSES

The most important element of success in community life, as in a ball game, a family, or a
school, is TEAM WORK; and team work depends, first of all, upon a COMMON PURPOSE. Our nation
gave an example of team work during the recent war such as is seldom seen; and this was be
cause every member of the nation was keenly intent on WINNING. We may see the same thing in
our school when Christmas entertainment is being planned, when an athletic tournament is approaching,
or when some other school activity is under way in which all are deeply interested. It is often
illustrated in our town, or rural neighborhood when some important enterprise is on foot, such
as the building of a new railroad into town, a Red Cross "drive" and a county fair, or the
construction of a much needed new schoolhouse.

RECOGNITION OF COMMON PURPOSES

All communities have common purposes, although they are not always as clearly defined as when
our nation was at war, or as in the other cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Sometimes
the people of a community, or a large portion of them, seem to be wholly unconscious that a
common purpose exists. This may be true even in a family or in a school. And when this happens,
the effect is the same as if there WERE no common purpose. No club or athletic team can be
successful unless its members have a common purpose AND UNDERSTAND IT. Insofar as our communities
are imperfect--and none of them, is perfect--it is largely because their members fail to recognize
or understand their common purposes.

People in communities have common purposes because they have the same wants. This may not at
first seem to be true.

COMMON PURPOSES DUE TO COMMON WANTS

If we visit a large city, we see throngs of people hurrying hither and thither, jostling one
another, apparently in the greatest confusion. We wonder where they are all going, what they
are doing, what they are seeking. In rural communities or in small towns there is less apparent
confusion than in the bustling life of the city. Yet even here it is not always easy to see
common purposes and common interests. Whether in large or small communities, we are more likely
to be impressed by the VARIETY of men's wants and even by the CONFLICT of their purposes.

But no matter how numerous and conflicting our wants may seem, they may all be grouped in a
very few important kinds, which are common to all of us alike. It will be worthwhile to test
the truth of this, because it will help us to see our community life in some kind of order,
and will throw a flood of light upon the common purposes that control it.

PHYSICAL WANTS: LIFE AND HEALTH

For example, we all want food, drink, and sleep, clothing to protect our bodies, and houses
to shelter us. But all these things supply our PHYSICAL wants; that is, they re late to LIFE
AND HEALTH. Many of the things that we do every day are important because of their relation
to our physical well-being. One reason why we enjoy out door sports is that they make our blood
tingle and give a sense of physical pleasure. Unless our physical wants are provided for, the
other wants of life cannot well be satisfied. Good health is a priceless possession.

Mention some things you have done today for your physical welfare.

THE WANT FOR ASSOCIATION WITH OTHERS

Another reason why sports and games give pleasure is be cause of the association they afford
with other people. ASSOCIATION WITH OTHERS is a second great want which explains many of the
things we do. Whatever may be our other reasons for going to school, it affords us the opportunity
to meet and work and play with other boys and girls to our pleasure and profit. One of the
objections often raised against life in the country is the lack of opportunity for association
with other people. But life in the country is not so isolated as it once was; and one may be
very much alone in a city crowd, where nearly all are strangers to one another, and where there
is very little real association among individuals. City families often live in the same apartment
house without knowing one another.

What are some things you do especially for the sake of companionship?

THE WANT FOR KNOWLEDGE

While going to school enables us to associate with others, the principal reason for going is
to gain KNOWLEDGE. Whether we always like our studies or not, we certainly want knowledge,
and seek it in many ways. We read the newspaper or magazine that comes to the home. We ask
questions of parents and others who have had more experience than we. We may travel to see
new sights. We examine with curiosity a new machine for the farm. The discoveries and inventions
that mark man's progress in civilization are the result of his unquenchable thirst for knowledge.

Mention some of the different ways in which you seek knowledge.

Mention some geographic and scientific discoveries that have been made through man's search
for knowledge.

What is science? Name some sciences.

THE WANT FOR BEAUTY

Besides health and knowledge and association with other people, we want surroundings that are
pleasant and beautiful. The want for BEAUTY is sometimes more neglected than other wants, but
it is important, and we all have it and seek to satisfy it in some way or other. It may be
at one time by a walk in the woods or fields, or at other times by cultivating flowers, by
keeping our room tidy, by looking at pictures, or by exercising good taste in clothing. We
also enjoy beauty in sound, as the song of birds or music in the home or school.

In what ways do you provide for this want?

THE RELIGIOUS WANT

Very likely we go to church on Sunday. It affords opportunity to enjoy association with others,
to add to our knowledge, and to hear beautiful music. But the church service is one of the
chief means by which people satisfy another of the great wants of life --the RELIGIOUS want.
Individuals differ in their religious ideas and in the depth of their religious feelings, but
in every community there are certain things that men do because of it.

What are some of the great religions of the world?

Is religion a strong influence in your community?

Can you mention any great historical events that were due to religious causes?

THE WANT FOR WEALTH

Perhaps after school, or on Saturdays, or in vacation time, we work at tasks to earn money,
or at least help in occupations that contribute to the "living" of the family. Doubtless we
have thought more or less about what we are going to do for a living after we leave school.
We all have a desire to own things, to have property, to accumulate WEALTH. This also is one
of the great wants of life. We have perhaps already experienced the satisfaction of raising
our own first crop of corn or potatoes, of acquiring our first livestock, of putting away or
selling our first supply of canned fruits or vegetables, of buying a set of tools, a bicycle,
or some books, of starting a bank account. But after all the chief reason why we want wealth,
or to "make money," is because of what we can do with it. It enables us to satisfy our wants.
Earning a living simply means earning the things that satisfy our wants in life.

Make a blackboard list of the occupations by which the parents and other members of the families
of the pupils in the class make a living.

Make a blackboard list of things done by members of the class to earn money.

What is your choice of occupation by which to make a living in the future? Why? Make a blackboard
list for the whole class.

THESE WANTS GIVE PURPOSE TO COMMUNITY LIFE

The six kinds of wants that we have indicated clearly account for many of the things that we
do. In fact, ALL of our wants are of one or another of these kinds and EVERYTHING we do is
important because of its relation to them. We may not be ready, yet, to accept this statement.
We may think of wants that seem at first not to fall under any of these six kinds. It will
do no harm to add other kinds to the list if we think it necessary. But, at all events, the
six kinds of wants mentioned are common to all of us. We live in communities in order to provide
for them, and a community is good to live in proportion as it provides for all of them adequately.
It is these wants that give COMMON PURPOSE to our community life.

Make as complete a list as possible of the things you did yesterday (outside of school as well
as in school). Then extend the list to include the more important things done during the entire
week.

Write the six wants across the top of a page of your notebook or a sheet of paper:

Health Knowledge Association Beauty Religion Wealth

Arrange the activities in your list in the six columns according to the wants which they satisfy.
If any activity clearly satisfies more than one of the wants, write it down in EACH of the
proper columns.

Which column is the longest? which comes next? which is the shortest?

Is your longest column also the longest in the lists made by other members of your class? Compare
your other columns with those of your classmates. Which wants seem to keep you busiest?

Which do you think is most important? Why? Discuss this question in class. Do you all agree
in regard to this point?

If any of the activities in your list are for the purpose of earning money, tell for what you
expect to spend the money. Show how the things you expect to buy with your money will help
to satisfy your other five wants.

For which of these six wants do you spend the most time in providing? your father? your mother?
If there is a difference in the three answers, why is it?

Do you have difficulty in classifying any of the things you do, or that you see others do,
under any of the six heads? Make note of these things and, as your study proceeds, see if the
difficulty of classification is removed.

Suppose a boy is a BULLY: what wants does he satisfy by his bullying conduct? Suppose a boy
or a girl is ambitious to become a LEADER, either among present companions or later in social
life, business, or politics: under which head or heads would you place this ambition?

A boy wants to enlist in the army, or a girl as an army nurse: do these wants come under any
of the six heads?

Would you, after your discussion of these topics, add any other group or kind of wants to the
six mentioned? If so, what would you call it?

Every one wants HAPPINESS. Why is it not necessary to make a special group under this head?

Make a list of things done in your home to provide for each of the six wants.

What is done in your school to provide for the want for health? for beauty? for association
with others? for the religious want? Has your school work any relation to your desire to make
a living? Is it the business of the school to provide for all these things as well as for the
want for knowledge?

Make a list of a few things done in your community outside of the home and school to provide
for each of the six wants.

Think of something in which your entire community is deeply interested, such as the improvement
of the roads, or the building of a new high school, or a county fair, and explain what wants
it provides for.

What wants do the following things provide for: rural mail delivery; weather reports; a corn
club (or a similar club); a school garden; a library; the telephone; a hospital; a parent-
teacher association?

THE PURPOSE OF DEMOCRACY

We may often hear our common purposes as communities or as a nation stated in different terms
than those suggested in the paragraphs above. For example, Franklin K. Lane, the Secretary
of the Interior during the war, said, "Our national purpose is to transmute days of dreary
work into happier lives--for ourselves first and for all others in their time." Again, President
Wilson said that our purpose in entering the world war was to help "make the world safe for
democracy." Although these two statements read differently, they mean very much the same thing;
and they both refer in general terms to the things this chapter discusses in more familiar
and express terms. For "happier lives" can only result from a more complete satisfaction of
our common wants. Our own happiness comes from the satisfaction of our own wants AND FROM HELPING
TO SATISFY THE WANTS OF OTHERS. And "democracy" means, in part, that the COMMON WANTS OF ALL
shall be properly provided for.

OUR UNALIENABLE RIGHTS

The statement that "all men are created equal" has troubled many people when they have thought
of the obvious inequalities that exist in natural ability and opportunity. But whatever inequalities
may exist, people are absolutely equal in their RIGHT to satisfy the wants described in this
chapter. These are the "unalienable rights" which the Declaration of Independence sums up in
the phrase "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." That community is best to live in
that most nearly provides equal opportunity for all its citizens to enjoy these rights. From
the Declaration of Independence to the present day, our great national purpose has been to
increase this opportunity, even though at times we have apparently not been conscious of it,
and even though we have fallen short of its fulfillment. One of the chief objects of our study
is to find out how our communities are seeking to accomplish this purpose.

"The Declaration of Independence did not mention the questions of our day. It is of no consequence
to us unless we can translate its general terms into examples of the present day and substitute
them in some vital way for the examples it itself gives, so concrete, so intimately involved
in the circumstances of the day in which it was conceived and written. It is an eminently practical
document, meant for the use of practical men ... Unless we can translate it into the questions
of our own day, we are not worthy of it, we are not sons of the sires who acted in response
to its challenge."-- Woodrow Wilson, in The New Freedom, pp. 48, 49.

A and B are two boys of the same age. One was born in a rich family, and one in a very poor
family. So far as this accident of birth is concerned, have they equal OPPORTUNITY to satisfy
the wants of life? Have they an equal RIGHT to health? to an education? to pleasant surroundings?
to earn a good living?

Suppose A is a Native American boy, and B a foreign-born boy who speaks a foreign language:
does this make any difference in their RIGHT to life and health, an education, etc.? Does it
make any difference in their OPPORTUNITY to satisfy their wants in these directions?

Can you think of persons in your community who have less OPPORTUNITY to satisfy their wants
than you have? Can you think of any persons who have less RIGHT to satisfy their wants than
you have?

The first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States comprise what is known as
a "bill of rights." Study together in class this bill of rights (see Appendix) to see how many
of the wants described in this chapter are there, provided for directly and indirectly.

Has your state constitution a bill of rights? If so, read it together in class for the same
purpose as suggested in the last question.

It should become a HABIT of both teacher and pupils to be on the constant lookout for news
items and discussions in available newspapers and periodicals illustrative of the points made
in each chapter or lesson. Individual scrapbooks may be made, but more important than this
is the assembling of such material as a class enterprise, its classification under proper heads,
and its preservation in scrapbooks or in files as working material for succeeding classes.
There will always be enough for each class to do, while each class at the same time contributes
to the success of the work of later classes. The idea of SERVICE should dominate such work.

CHAPTER II

HOW WE DEPEND UPON ONE ANOTHER IN COMMUNITY LIFE

INTERDEPENDENCE AN IMPORTANT FACT

Nothing could be freer than air. But even as we sit in our schoolroom, whether or not we get
all the pure air we need, depends upon how the schoolhouse was built for ventilation, the number
of people who occupy the room, the care that is taken by others to keep the room free from
dust, the health and cleanliness of those who sit in the room with us. If this dependence upon
others is true in the case of the very air we breathe, how much more true it must be of other
necessities of life that are not so abundant.

This dependence of people upon one another for the satisfaction of their wants is one of the
most important facts about community life. It is not merely that A and B have the SAME wants,
but that A is dependent upon B, and B upon A, for the satisfaction of their wants, that makes
their wants COMMON.

Mention the people, both inside and outside of your home, who had a share in providing for
you the food you had for breakfast or dinner.

Mention all the workers that occur to you who have been employed in producing the clothing
you wear; the book you are reading; the materials of which your house is built.

Show how the people who produce these things are dependent upon your wants for their livelihood.

Show that you are dependent upon other people for your education; for recreation. Are other
people dependent upon your education for their welfare? Are others dependent on you for their
recreation?

INDEPENDENCE OF THE PIONEER

The farmer's life is often spoken of as an independent life. His independence was certainly
much more complete in pioneer days than it is now. In regard to the early days of Indiana,
it has been said:

Give the pioneer farmer an axe and an auger, or in place of the last a burning iron, and he
could make almost any machine that he was wont to work with. With his sharp axe he could not
only cut the logs for his cabin and notch them down, but he could make a close-fitting door
and supply it with wooden hinges and a neat latch. From the roots of an oak or ash he could
fashion his hames and sled runners; he could make an axle-tree for his wagon, a rake, a flax
brake, a barrow, a scythe-snath, a grain cradle a pitchfork, a loom, a reel, a washboard, a
stool, a chair, a table, a bedstead, a dresser, and a cradle in which to rock the baby. If
he was more than ordinarily clever, he repaired his own cooperage, and adding a drawing knife
to his kit of tools, he even went so far as to make his own casks, tubs, and buckets. He made
and mended his own shoes. [Footnote: Quoted in Pioneer Indianapolis, by Ida Stearns Stickney,
p. 11 (Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis).]

We also read that in early New England:

Every farmhouse was a manufactory, not of one kind of goods, but of many. All day long in the
chamber or attic the sound of the spinning-wheel and loom could be heard. Carpets, shawls,
bedspreads, tablecovers, towels, and cloth for garments were made from materials made on the
farm. The kitchen of the house was a baker's shop, a confectioner's establishment, and a chemist's
laboratory. Every kind of food for immediate use was prepared there daily; and on special occasions
sausages, head cheese, pickles, apple butter, and preserves were made. It was also the place
where soap, candles, and vinegar were manufactured. Agricultural implements were then few and
simple, and farmers made as many of them as they could. Every farmhouse was a creamery and
cheese factory. As there were no sewing machines, the farmer's wife and daughters had to ply
the hand needle most of the time when they were not engaged in more laborious pursuits. During
the long evenings they generally knit socks and mittens or made rag carpets. [Footnote: Nourse,
Agricultural Economics, p 64, from "The Farmer's Changed Conditions," by Rodney Welsh, in the
Forum, x, 689-92 (Feb., 1891).]

THE PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE

But even under such conditions as those described, the farmer and his family were not wholly
independent. Even Robinson Crusoe on his lonely island was dependent upon the tools and equipment
that he saved from shipwrecks, and that were the product of other men's labor. So, also, the
pioneer farmer had to maintain some kind of relation, however infrequent and slight, with the
outside world. Moreover, he had to pay for his comparative independence by many privations.
He had all the wants described in the preceding chapter, but he had to provide for them in
the simplest way possible, and often they were hardly provided for at all.

THE GROWTH OF INTERDEPENDENCE

As soon as a number of people come to live together, even in a pioneer community, it is likely
that some members will have a knack for doing certain things of use to the community better
than others can do them. Thus one man may be especially skillful in making axe handles. In
time, the entire community comes to depend upon him for its axe handles. In addition, he probably
makes other tools and does repair work of all kinds. This requires so much of his time that
he does little or no farming, and depends upon others for his food supply. So in a course of
time the community has its blacksmiths, carpenters, shoe-makers, teachers, storekeepers and
doctors upon whom it depends for their special kinds of service, while each of them depends
upon others to supply the wants that he has neither the time nor the skill to supply for himself.
Thus interdependence develops in the simplest communities.

THE DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS OF THE MODERN FARMER

The farmer still does many things on the farm that in the city would be done by special workers,
such as repairing houses, barns, and tools. But he has become vastly more dependent upon others
than formerly. This is due partly to improved farming methods, requiring the use of complicated
machines and greater technical knowledge; and partly to improved means of transportation and
communication which bring him in close touch with trade centers. If a farmer needs a new axe
handle, he can get a better one with less expenditure of time and effort by going to town in
his automobile than if he made it himself. His farm machinery is too complicated for him to
repair except in small matters, and even then he must go or send to town for the necessary
parts, which may be sent to him by parcel post. Not only does he get better tools and services
generally through this reliance upon others who are specialists in their lines, but also on
account of it has more time to give to the actual business of farming, for which others depend
upon him, and leisure for thoughtful study of his problems, for social life, and for recreation.

THE VALUE OF SELF-RELIANCE

It must be acknowledged that reliance upon others may be carried so far as to result in loss
or disadvantage. "Self-reliance" is one of the most admirable traits of character. The pioneer
farmer possessed it from necessity to a remarkable extent. A habit of depending upon others
may quickly cause a person to lose the "knack" of doing things for himself, to become less
"handy about the place," and less "thrifty" about keeping things in repair or installing small
improvements--the casting of a cement trough, mending the harness or the fence or painting
the barn.

WHO MAKES OUR SHOES

The interdependence of people in community life to-day may be illustrated by starting with
some of our own needs, as was suggested in the topics on page 12. For example, if we need a
pair of shoes, we must have money, which we will suppose that we earn by farming. In order
to farm successfully we must have machinery. This we also buy in town; but it is manufactured
for us in distant city factories from metals procured from mines and from wood from the forest.
The shoes bought at the store were also made in a factory employing hundreds of men and women,
perhaps in Massachusetts. They were made from leather from the hides of cattle raised in the
far west, or perhaps even in the Argentine Republic. The leather is tanned by another industry,
and tanning requires the use of an acid from the bark of certain trees from the forest. The
making of the shoes also requires machinery which is made by still other machines, the necessary
metals coming from mines. To smelt the metals and to run the factories there must be fuel from
other mines. Meanwhile the workers in all these industries must be fed and clothed and housed.
This means the work of farmers, food packers, millers and bakers, lumbermen, carpenters, cotton
and woolen mills, clothing factories, and many others. At every stage transportation enters
in,--by team and automobile truck, by railway, by water. These are only a part of the activities
necessary in order that we may have a pair of shoes. It would seem that practically every kind
of worker and industry in the world had something to do with it. People in communities today
are indeed very interdependent.

The following item appeared in a newspaper:

HELD BACK BY NEIGHBORS

Farmer Is Limited by Conditions in Community

The average farmer is limited in the changes he can make in his farm business by the farm practices
of the community in which he is living.

There are farmers in every community who would like to change their systems of agriculture
but are restrained from doing so by the fact that their neighbors will not change. Many farmers
have tried to change from one type of farming to another better suited to the region, but failed
because the cost of running such an entirely independent business was too great.

A man owning an orchard in a locality where there are no other orchards has trouble getting
rid of his crop. Even when the farmer is so fortunate as to get buyers, he generally receives
a lower price for the same grade of fruit than would be received in a general apple-growing region.

If a man wants to buy several purebred Holstein cows, he generally goes to a locality where
a large number of farmers keep that kind of stock. Often there is a man in his own community
who has for sale Holsteins that are just as highly bred as those in other districts, but he
either has no market for them or must sell them at a greatly reduced price.

The farmer ought not to think on account of these facts that he should not change his system
of farming just because his neighbors do not do likewise.

Probably the best way for a farmer to start such a movement is to arouse the interest of his
neighbors in his farming operations. As soon as this has been accomplished he can gradually
bring about the change that he advocates. Farmers in a community profit from the experiences
of other individuals.

WHAT GIVES VALUE TO LAND

The value of a man's property is dependent not upon his efforts alone, but upon what his neighbors
do. The land occupied by a pioneer increases in value as other people settle in the neighborhood,
and BECAUSE they settle there. Men often buy land and then simply wait for it to increase in
value because of improvements in the neighborhood. The property that we own may increase or
decrease in value according to the care that neighbors take of their property. Even if we take
good care of our property, it will be less valuable if the neighbors let their fences and buildings
run down and the weeds grow than it will be if they keep their fences and buildings in good
repair and their weeds cut.

INTERDEPENDENCE IN HEALTH

Malaria is carried by mosquitoes, and we know that mosquitoes breed in standing water, as in
swamps and in old barrels or tin cans that hold rainwater until it becomes stagnant. Now we
may endeavor to get rid of mosquitoes, and thus of malaria, by removing all open receptacles
of water about our premises and by draining the marshes on our land; but unless our neighbors
do the same, we are not much better off than we were before.

Give other illustrations to show the dependence of people upon one another in your community.

Compare the farmer of to-day in your neighborhood with the pioneer of Indiana described on
page 14 with respect to his equipment, skill in making things and kinds of implements used.

Compare the average farmer's home in your neighborhood to-day with that of the New England
farmer described on page 14 with respect to household activities.

Are farmers in your neighborhood to-day more or less dependent upon others to supply their
wants than they were when your parents were children? Why is it? Get all the information you
can from your parents on this point.

Which is more dependent upon others for its daily wants: a family that lives on a farm in your
neighborhood or one that lives in town? Give examples to prove your answer.

Do you know cases in your own community where land has increased in value while lying idle?
What are the reasons?

Do you know of cases in your community where property has depreciated in value because of neighborhood
influences such as suggested on page 18?

Do you know of cases in your community similar to the one described on page 17 under the heading
"Held Back by Neighbors"? Explain. (Consult at home.)

UNEXPECTED RESULTS OF INTERDEPENDENCE

We do not always realize how dependent we are upon one another until something happens to disturb
our accustomed relations. We best realize our dependence upon the telephone when it is out
of order. The recent great war produced conditions that made us conscious of our interdependence
in unexpected ways.

For example, if we had gone into a store to buy underwear in the early part of the war, we
would have found that the price had greatly increased, and we might have been told, if the
salesman were well informed, that the high price was due to the manufacture of airplanes! The
explanation is that the wire stays used in the manufacture of airplanes are made of steel wire
from which machine knitting needles are also made. In the early part of the war all of the
available wire of this kind was taken for airplanes, thus limiting the supply of knitting needles
and consequently of knit goods.

The manufacture of airplanes is also said to have affected the price of fish! The nets used
for catching certain deep-sea fish, such as cod, must be made of linen, which is invisible
in water. The linen which had been used for this purpose suddenly came into great demand for
the manufacture of airplane wings. Since airplanes were necessary, linen fishing nets were
sacrificed and the price of deep-sea fish went up. This, of course, created a demand for other
kinds of fish, and the price of the latter also went up.

CONFLICTS DUE TO INTERDEPENDENCE

When people are so closely dependent upon one another conflicts are likely to occur. Sometimes
they are due to selfish disregard by some persons of the rights and interests of others; but
more often they are due simply to failure to see what the real results of a particular act
may be and how it may affect other people. It was not dreamed that the building of airplanes
would affect the price of underwear and fish, and it was only after careful investigation that
the relation between these things was discovered. A family that is careless in the disposal
of refuse from the household and stables may unconsciously poison the wells of neighbors half
a mile away. Sometimes men oppose public improvements, such as better roads, or a new schoolhouse,
because they see only the direct costs of the improvements, and fail to see the more important
losses to themselves and to the community if the improvements are not made.

DANGER OF HASTY JUDGMENTS

One thing we may learn from such facts as these is the danger of forming hasty judgments about
things that happen, or conditions that exist, or proposals that are made, in our community
life. Even those conditions or events that are apparently most simple may be related to other
conditions and events that are not at first apparent. Wise judgment and wise action are dependent
upon the most complete knowledge obtainable.

We shall see, as we proceed with our study, how this fact of interdependence appears in every
phase of our community life.

From observation in your own community, give illustrations to show how people, in attempting
to satisfy their own wants, may interfere with the efforts of others to satisfy theirs. The
following are given as suggestions:

An employer and those whom he employs.

A man who owns a house or farm and the tenant to whom he rents it.

A man who keeps a livery stable adjoining a schoolhouse.

A grocer who displays his goods on the sidewalk (especially food products).

Men who raise cattle and those who raise sheep on the western ranges.

A boy who raises chickens and one who has a garden adjoining.

Suppose a schoolmate comes to school with measles or some other contagious disease. How may
this affect your schoolwork? your association with your friends? How may it even add to your
father's expenses?

Show that your schoolmates are as dependent upon you as you are upon them.

Is the community in which you live dependent upon you in any way? Give illustrations.

Taxpayers like to keep the tax rate as low as possible. In their interest in doing this, is
it possible that they might interfere with your getting a good education in favorable surroundings?
Explain. Who are the taxpayers?

We often hear of "self-made men." What does it mean? Can a man be entirely "self-made"?

Does a child become more or less dependent upon others as he grows older? Explain your answer.

Show that as a person becomes more "self-dependent" other people become more dependent upon
him; for example, in the home, and in school.

Watch the newspapers for items illustrating interdependence, or conflicts due to it.

CHAPTER III

THE NEED FOR COOPERATION IN COMMUNITY LIFE

THE NEED FOR TEAMWORK

When people have common purposes and are dependent upon one another in accomplishing them,
there must be COOPERATION, which is another name for "teamwork." A team of horses that does
not pull together can not haul a heavy load. A baseball team, though composed of good players,
will seldom win games unless its teamwork is good. A few soldiers may easily disperse a large
mob because they have teamwork, while a mob usually does not. This principle of "pulling together,"
"teamwork," or "cooperation," is of the greatest importance in community life. There can be
no real community life without it.

SIMPLE TYPES OF COOPERATION

In the early days there were "barn raisings," when neighbors came together to help one of their
number to "raise" his barn; and all the men of a pioneer community contributed their labor
in building the community church or schoolhouse. This was a simple form of cooperation. It
may be seen now at threshing time, when neighboring farmers combine to thresh the grain of
each, the same group of men and the same threshing machine doing the work for all. The United
States Department of Agriculture reports that:

In a group of 14 farmers situated in a community in one of the best farming regions in the
corn belt, ... it was found that 5 men out of the 14 failed to get all their corn planted by
the last week in May. They had worked as hard and as steadily at that operation as had their
neighbors, but they were delayed by one cause or another, such as lack of labor or teams, or
were handling a larger acreage than their equipment would allow them to handle satisfactorily.
In this same community were 3 men who completed all their planting operations before the 20th
of May, and 5 others who completed their work by the 25th of May. ... If all these men had
considered that corn planting was a national necessity and had pooled their efforts, all of
the corn on all the farms could have been planted within the most favorable time. [Footnote:
The Farm Labor Problem, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of the Secretary, Circular No.
112, p. 5.]

Give other illustrations of this sort of cooperation from the farm or community life of your
neighborhood.

Give illustrations of such teamwork among boys and girls.

Give illustrations of the failure of enterprises in which you have been interested because
of a lack of teamwork.

Why is it an advantage for the farmers to use one threshing machine for all the threshing of
the neighborhood instead of each farmer having his own machine?

ORGANIZED COOPERATION AND LEADERSHIP

As communities grow and the people become more dependent upon one another, and especially when
it becomes hard to see how one thing that happens may affect others, as shown in Chapter II,
cooperation becomes more difficult, but it becomes even more necessary. It needs to be ORGANIZED,
and it needs LEADERSHIP. The experience of fruit growers in California affords a good illustration
of this. When they acted independently of one another, they often had difficulty in disposing
of their product to advantage. Sometimes it rotted on the ground. As individuals they did not
have the means of learning where the best markets were. They had to make their own terms separately
with the railroads for transportation and since they shipped in small quantities, they paid
high freight rates. They had no adequate means of storing fruit while it was awaiting shipment.
They were dependent upon commission merchants in the cities for such prices as they could get,
which were often practically nothing at all.

These and other difficulties that made fruit growing unprofitable were overcome by the organization
of fruit growers' associations, in which each grower may become a member by purchasing shares
of stock. The members elect from their number a BOARD OF DIRECTORS, who in turn appoint a BUSINESS
MANAGER who gives his entire attention to the association's business. The association has central
offices and storage and packing houses.

The manager keeps in close touch with market conditions,--where the demand for fruit is greatest,
the kinds of fruit wanted, the best prices paid. He contracts for the sale of fruit at fair
prices. Shipping in large quantities, he gets the advantage of low rates on fast freight trains
with refrigerator cars. Uniform methods of packing fruit are adopted, sometimes the fruit being
packed at the central packing house. Information is distributed as to the best methods of growing
fruit, the best varieties to grow, and so on. On the other hand, supplies and provisions are
bought in large quantities, securing the best quality at the lowest prices.

VOLUNTARY COOPERATION IN CITIES

In cities there are almost innumerable organizations by which groups of people cooperate for
one purpose or another. Men in the same line of business or in the same profession organize
to promote their common interests. There are boards of trade, chambers of commerce, merchants'
and manufacturers' associations. Lawyers have their bar associations, physicians their medical
associations. There are associations of teachers, and work men in the various trades have their
unions. Besides such business and professional organizations, there are clubs and associations
of all sorts for men, for women, and even for children, some of them educational, some social
or recreational, some philanthropic, some religious. Where there are so many people interested
in the same thing, where it is easy for them to meet together, and where competent leadership
is forthcoming, it is quite the usual thing to organize for united action.

COOPERATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

In agricultural communities cooperation has developed more slowly. Farmers have been too isolated
from one another to make organization easy, they have not fully realized its advantages, and
they have lacked leadership. This has been an obstacle to the fullest development of community
life. The most backward communities are those where there is the least cooperation. In such
communities "the farmer works single-handed, getting no strength from joint action or combined
effort."

But all this is changing. Organizations like the fruit growers' associations are becoming common
and are proving their value. The map on page 36 shows the distribution of organizations among
farmers in the United States for cooperation in business enterprises of various kinds, though
it shows only about half as many as actually exist. They include cooperative grain elevators
and warehouses, creameries and cheese factories, cooperative stores, fruit and grain growers'
associations, livestock associations, cotton and tobacco associations, and many others.

Study the map on page 36 and indicate the region or regions where you think cooperative grain
elevators and warehouses would be most numerous; livestock associations; dairies and creameries;
fruit growers' associations; cotton growers' associations; tobacco growers' associations.

Are there any organizations of farmers in your community similar to those in the list in the
last paragraph above? Make a list of them. What are their purposes? What are their advantages?
What obstacles have they encountered? Are all the farmers in the community members? If not,
why? Describe their plans of organization--membership, officers, management, etc. (Discuss
these questions at home and report results.)

Is there any organization of businessmen, or of workmen, in your town or neighboring town?
If so, ascertain what advantages it seeks.

Show how an ordinary store, or a bank, or a grain elevator, is a means by which people cooperate.

Are there any boys' or girls' clubs in your community? Show how such clubs require and secure
cooperation. How is leadership provided?

If there is a parents' association connected with your school, show how it brings about cooperation
among its members in the interest of the school.

Make a list of all the organizations you can think of in your community (such as clubs, societies,
associations). Opposite the name of each write the chief purposes for which it exists.

Write the six great wants across the top of a page, as suggested in the fifth topic on page
6, and arrange the list of organizations suggested in the last question above in the proper
columns according to the wants they provide for.

Discuss the importance of leadership in school activities. What are the qualities that make
a good leader?

Who are some of the leaders in your community, both men and women?

THE FARM BUREAU

At the close of 1916 there were nearly three hundred "farm bureaus" in the northern and western
states with a membership of nearly 100,000. A farm bureau is an organization to secure cooperation
throughout an entire county for the promotion of agricultural interests. The members elect
an executive committee to manage the affairs of the bureau. In each of the small communities
of which the county is made up, there is a "community committee." The chairmen of the several
community committees constitute a county agricultural council. The chairmen and members of
the various committees are chosen because of their interest in special lines of work and their
fitness to direct such work. Various other organizations in the county, such as the fair association,
breeders' associations, the Grange, the schools, and others, are represented in the committees
of the bureau, the purpose being to secure teamwork among them, as well as among the different
communities of the county and among the individual farmers. The bureau also cooperates with
the state and national governments in employing a COUNTY AGRICULTURAL AGENT, who is the bureau's
adviser, or leader. In short, the farm bureau represents the county working together in an
organized way and under leadership for the improvement of community life.

In the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for the year 1915, the story is told of Christian
County, Kentucky. [Footnote: "How the Whole County Demonstrated," 1915 Year Book, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, pp. 225-248.]

A CASE OF COUNTY COOPERATION

This county is almost wholly agricultural, but the county seat is a small city of 10,000. There
had formerly been more or less jealousy between the city and county, as too frequently happens.
But a businessmen's association was organized in the city, which interested itself in bettering
the agricultural conditions of the county, because the business of the city was very dependent
upon the neighboring agriculture. A "crop improvement association" was formed, including farmers
in its membership. A county agricultural agent was employed, and local community clubs were
organized in different parts of the county, which held meetings attended by the farmers and
their families, and by businessmen from the city. A good roads association was organized, and
a "good roads day" was held on which businessmen turned out with the farmers, stores of the
city were closed, and on one of the principal roads at least 90 per cent of the workmen were
city men. Stone was contributed by contractors, concrete firms furnished men gratis to repair
bridges, one company supplied outfits for trimming trees, and a large amount of work was done
by the county and town working side by side ... Such results could only be accomplished through
unity of purpose and cooperation of all the people.

Among other things accomplished in this county, a fair association has been formed; medical
instruction has been introduced into the schools; a public library and hospital have been built;
the school system of the county has cooperated in all educational work; both town and county
merchants have offered prizes to members of the boys' clubs; also for cooking in the schools,
and have put women's restrooms in the stores for the use of the public.

There is now an active girls' canning club in every community in the county, attended by the
girls and also by their mothers. There are 12 social clubs which meet regularly; 15 parent-teachers'
and mothers' clubs; and there is not a school in the county which does not have some form of
community meeting. The schoolhouses are generally used for the meetings of the community clubs.
In some instances farmers have given sufficient ground for amusement purposes at the schoolhouses.
Here may be found the ball diamond, tennis court, and basketball courts.

It is said of this county that it "stands as a demonstration of the effect of education and
organization under the proper leadership. THE TOWN AND THE COUNTY ARE ONE. The result is better
agriculture, better business, and better living." Write a brief theme on one of the following
topics:

(a) The importance of the telephone as a means of cooperation in my community.

(b) Instances in my community where bad roads have caused a lack of cooperation.

(c) Instances in my community where improvement of roads has led to better cooperation.

In what ways do you think there is need for better cooperation in your community? Discuss this
with your parents, and report in class the result of your talk with them.

Is there any organized cooperation in your community or county as a whole for the general improvement
of the community or county?

Investigate the organization and work of a farm bureau. (If there is none in your county, write
to your State Agricultural College or to the States Relations Service, Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D.C., for information. See references at the end of this chapter.)

PUBLIC LIBRARY AS AN EXAMPLE

Cooperation is as necessary for the fullest satisfaction of our other wants as it is in the
business of making a living. In one pioneer community there were few "books and papers and
they were handed about from house to house." There may be comparatively few people in a community
who can afford to buy a hundred books each year; but there may easily be a hundred persons
who could buy one book each, and by some arrangement exchange with one another, so that each
could in the course of a year have the use of a hundred books. Neighborhood clubs are often
organized to subscribe for magazines on this plan. A public library provides an arrangement
by which a great variety of good reading matter can be enjoyed by the entire community at trifling
cost to each member. In fact, we may be able to draw books from such a library without any
cost to ourselves; but the books which we thus enjoy do cost the community a large sum of money,
and our free enjoyment of them is one of the advantages of community cooperation. Our part
in the cooperation is in using the books carefully and in returning them promptly, so that
as many people as possible may have the use of them.

NATION-WIDE COOPERATION

The necessity for cooperation is by no means limited to our neighborhood or county or city.
People with common purposes organize for cooperation on a state-wide or nation-wide scale.
Following is a list of national organizations in the interest of agriculture. As our study
proceeds, we shall have abundant illustration of the value of cooperation and of the disadvantages
that follow from its absence.

COOPERATION A MATTER OF HABIT

Cooperation is largely a matter of habit. Habits can be formed only by practice; and opportunity
to practice cooperation is abundant if we are only on the lookout for it. We shall find that
it not only secures better results in whatever we are doing, but that it also adds greatly
to the enjoyment of life. Let us not forget that cooperation merely means "team work," working
together for the common good.

"They who cannot or will not work together are always in a weak position when brought into
competition with those who can and do." [Footnote: Carver, The Organization of a Rural Community,
p. 5.]

If there is a public library in your community, what benefits do you get from it? About how
many books do you draw from it in the course of a year? What would these books cost you if
you bought them? What do they cost you when you draw them from the library?

Usually a fine is imposed for keeping a book from the library beyond a specified time. Show
why this is proper.

CHAPTER IV

WHY WE HAVE GOVERNMENT

GOVERNMENT A MEANS TO SECURE COOPERATION

We are now in a better position to understand why we have government. It is a means by which
to secure cooperation, or team work.

IN EDUCATION

When a schoolhouse is built to-day, it is not done by combined manual labor, as in the pioneer
community. As in all building, there is cooperation of a highly organized kind in the production
and assembling of the materials and in the construction of the building by workmen of different
kinds. But more than this, since the schoolhouse is a PUBLIC BUILDING, the community cooperates
in paying for it. This is done by means of TAXES. The people pay taxes not only for the building,
but also to meet the cost of operating the school, paying the teachers, buying equipment, and
heating the building.

The community must know how much money is needed for the school, the taxes must be fairly apportioned
and collected, and the school must be properly managed to perform the community's work of education.
In small communities the people may meet together to vote the taxes and to decide on other
matters relating to education, as in New England towns. But there must be leadership, and there
must be an organization to perform the work which the community wants done. Every community
therefore has its board of education, or school committee, a superintendent, and other officials.
Such organization corresponds to the board of directors and business manager of the fruit growers'
association, only it represents the entire community and attends to the community's business
of education. It is part of the community's governing machinery.

Ascertain from your father how much school tax he pays each year. Who determines the amount
of this tax? To whom does he pay it?

Could you employ a teacher at home for the amount your father pays as school tax? If you had
a teacher at home, could you get as good an education as you can now get at school? Explain
your answer.

In what ways do you cooperate with the community to make the school a success?

If there is a public library in your community, is it supported by taxation? Who manages the
public library for the community?

IN FIRE PROTECTION

When a building takes fire in the country the neighbors gather as quickly as possible to fight
the flames by such means as may be at hand, but seldom very effectively. In a small city or
town, there may be a volunteer fire company composed of men who, when a fire breaks out, leave
their usual occupations to save the property. In large cities, fully equipped and costly fire
departments are maintained, with paid firemen who are always on duty. The police usually keep
the crowd away from the burning building, not only for their own safety, but because they would
hinder rather than help the trained and organized firemen. In each case there is cooperation
for fire protection; the greater the common danger, the more perfect the organization and the
more complete the control by government.

IN ROAD BUILDING

It was once the usual practice, as it still is in some localities, for each farmer to give
a certain number of days each year to work on the roads. Now, in the most progressive communities,
the roads are better and more uniformly built and kept in better repair because they are placed
by the community in charge of skilled roadmakers paid for by taxation. But whether the farmer
contributes money or labor, or both, cooperation is planned and directed by the government.
(See Chapter XVII.)

IN HEALTH PROTECTION

In Benjamin Franklin's time, each householder in Philadelphia swept the pavement in front of
his home if he wanted it kept clean. ... I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a
day or two went around to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was
unanimously signed, and for a time well executed.

This was community cooperation under simple conditions. A hundred years later, the one and
a half million people living in Philadelphia were just as truly cooperating to keep their city
clean by means of more than 1200 miles of sewers for which they had paid nearly 35 millions
of dollars, and by means of a department of highways and street-cleaning which employed a contractor
to clean the streets and to remove all ashes and garbage at an annual cost of more than a million
and a half dollars. This is all under the direction of the city government.

IN STATE AND NATIONAL AFFAIRS

What is true of our local boards of education, road supervisors, fire and street-cleaning departments,
and other departments of our local governments, is also true of state and national governments.
We shall not stop for illustrations of this now, because they will be numerous in later chapters.
(See, for example, Chapter XII.)

Is there a government in your home? If so, prove whether or not it is a means by which the
members of the family cooperate.

Describe the government of your school and show how it secures cooperation.

If you can get a copy of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, find in it further instances in
which he improved the cooperation of his community, as for fire protection and street lighting.

Show how street lights in town represent community cooperation. For what purpose is this form
of cooperation?

Give additional illustrations to prove that government in your community is a means of cooperation.

In what ways can you cooperate with the school board or trustees of your community, and thus
with the community itself, for better schools?

GOVERNMENT TO HELP AND NOT TO REPRESS

A number of boys whose lives were spent mostly in the city streets were once asked what the
word "government" suggested to them. Some of them at once answered, "The policeman!" And when
they were asked "Why?" they replied, "He arrests people," "He makes us keep off the grass in
the parks," "He drives us off when we play ball in vacant lots." These answers represent a
common idea about government, that it is something over us to restrict our freedom. Government
does restrict the freedom of individuals at times; but one of the best illustrations of its
real purpose is the traffic policeman in cities. He stands at the crossing of busy streets,
regulating the movement of people and vehicles in such a way as to insure the safety of all
and to keep the intersecting streams of traffic moving smoothly and with as little interruption
as possible. Now and then he leaves his post to help a child or an aged person or a cripple
across the street; or answers the inquiries of a stranger. If now and then he arrests a driver,
it is because the latter disregards the rights or welfare of others.

LAWS AS SIGNALS OF COOPERATION

In small or thinly settled communities there may be no traffic policeman; but there may be
signs at the intersection of highways to guide travelers, or warnings such as "Dangerous Curve!"
or "School: Drive Slowly!" Such signs are usually posted by state or local authorities in accordance
with LAW. And even where there are no signs, the laws themselves are supposed to regulate traffic.
Some one has compared the laws in our country to the signals given to a football team by the
quarterback. These signals are agreed upon in advance by the team, and tell each player not
only what he himself, but also what every other player, is to do, and thus team work is secured.
And so our laws are said to be "signals of cooperation," just as much as the sign "Drive Slowly,"
or as when the traffic policeman holds up his hand or blows his whistle.

LAWS AS RULES OF THE GAME

Laws, however, are more than "signals" of cooperation; they are also RULES by which cooperation
is secured--"rules of the game." Wherever people are dependent upon one another and work together
there must be rules of conduct. One kind of rules consists of what we call "etiquette" or "good
manners." We have doubtless all observed how much better an athletic contest moves along, or
even the ordinary sports of the playground, where good manners prevail. "Good manners" include
more than the "party manners" that we put on and take off on special occasions, like "party
clothes." They consist of the accepted rules of behavior toward those with whom we associate.
In the home, in school, in business, in public places, there are "good manners" that are recognized
by custom and that make the wheels move smoothly and without jar. We do not need a law or a
policeman to require a man to give way to a woman, or even to another man, in passing through
a doorway; good manners provide for this. Even on the public street much confusion is avoided
by an observance of good manners, or CUSTOM. Thoughtful people instinctively turn to the right
in passing others (in England and Canada the custom is to turn to the left) without thinking
whether there is a law on the subject or not.

LAW GIVES FREEDOM

Now most of our laws that regulate the conduct of individuals are simply rules that experience
has proved to be of the greatest advantage to the greatest number, and that are necessary because
SOME people have not "good manners." Most people observe them, not because they are laws, but
because they are reasonable and helpful in avoiding friction and in securing cooperation. If
they are good laws, it is only the "ill-mannered" who are really conscious of their existence.
Just laws restrict the freedom only of the "ill- mannered," while they GIVE freedom to those
who have "good manners."

What street or highway signs are there in your community? Who placed them? Are they faithfully
observed? If not, why?

What signals are there in your school? Discuss their usefulness.

What are some of the "rules" of your school? Are they good rules? Why? Are they an advantage
or a disadvantage to yourself? If they did not exist, would your own conduct be different? Why?

What are some of the rules of good manners that are supposed to control conduct in your school?
in your home? in the street? Discuss their reasonableness. Do they enlarge or restrict freedom?

Do the rules of football, or other games, increase or decrease the freedom of play?

What are some of the laws that control conduct in your community? Would most people observe
the laws you mention even if they were not written laws, and if there were no penalty for failing
to observe them? Why?

THE ORIGIN OF LAW

The following story illustrates the difference between law and custom, or "manners," and how
the former may develop out of the latter. [Footnote: "Rudimentary Society among Boys," by John
Johnson, in Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science, vol. ii (1884).
The story as here given is reproduced from Lessons in Community and National Life, Series C,
p. 145, U. S. Bureau of Education (Lesson C-18, "Cooperation through Law," by Arthur W. Dunn).
] There was once a boys' school located in an 800-acre tract of land, in the fields and woods
of which the boys, when free from their studies, gathered nuts, trapped small animals, and
otherwise lived much like primitive hunters.

Just after midnight some morning early in October, when the first frosts of the season loosened
the grasp of the nuts upon the limbs, parties of two or three boys might be seen rushing at
full speed over the wet fields. When the swiftest party reached a walnut tree, one of the number
climbed up rapidly, shook off half a bushel of nuts and scrambled down again. Then off the
boys went to the next tree, where the process was repeated unless the tree was occupied by
other boys doing likewise. Nut hunters coming to the tree after the first party had been there,
and wishing to shake the tree some more, were required by custom to pile up all the nuts that
lay under the tree. Until this was done, the unwritten law did not permit their shaking any
more nuts on the ground.

So far this was a CUSTOM accepted by the boys because of its reasonableness. But after a while,
some members of this boy community thought to get ahead of the other members. One night before
frost came they secretly went to the woods and took possession of most of the nut trees by
shaking them according to custom. When this was discovered, some of the leaders of the community
CALLED A MEETING of all the boys. After discussing the matter thoroughly, they provided against
a repetition of the trick by MAKING A RULE (passing a law) that thereafter the harvesting of
nuts should not begin before A FIXED DATE in October.

These boys acted very much as men have often acted under simple conditions of community life.
The New England "town meeting," for example, is precisely the same thing as the boys' meeting.

THE SECOND ELEMENT IN DEMOCRACY: CONTROL BY THE PEOPLE

We shall study the organization and methods of lawmaking in later chapters. At present we are
merely noting WHY we have laws, and the fact that they are supposed to be made, directly or
indirectly, by the people themselves. And right here we see the second thing necessary to make
a DEMOCRACY. On page 9 we saw that in a democracy all people have certain equal and "unalienable"
rights, and that that community is most democratic that affords its members most nearly equal
opportunity to enjoy these rights. Now we see further that in a democracy the people make their
own laws. Moreover, the laws of a democracy control, not only the conduct of the people, but
also the government itself. The government of a democracy may do only those things, and use
only those methods, for which the people give the authority. It is only when government exercises
power without control by the people that it becomes autocratic.

TWO HISTORIC DOCUMENTS

The purpose of our government is clearly stated in two historic documents.

DEMOCRACY A GOAL STILL TO BE REACHED

It is not to be supposed that our government and our laws are perfect. They cannot be perfect
as long as they are made and operated by imperfect people. It is possible, for example, that
the boys of the city had a just complaint against the government for not permitting them to
play ball in vacant lots, UNLESS THE COMMUNITY AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDED THEM WITH ANOTHER
SUITABLE PLACE FOR THE GAME--for every community should protect the right of its boys and girls
to play. We are far from having attained complete democracy. It is a goal toward which men
are struggling, and have been struggling for centuries--since long before our Revolutionary
War, and in other countries as well as in our own. The great world war which began in 1914,
and which the United States entered in 1917, was a war to establish more firmly in the world
the principles of democratic government. Whether these principles shall be carried out in practice,
and whether our governments--local, state, and national--shall fulfill the purposes so clearly
stated in the preamble to the Constitution, depends upon the extent to which each citizen understands
these purposes, and cooperates with his fellow-citizens and with his governments in support
of them.

THE "RIGHT IDEA OF IT"

It is said that in one of the training camps during the war an officer addressed a squad of
new recruits as follows:

Boys, I want you to get the right idea of the salute. I do not want you to think that you are
being compelled to salute me as an individual. No! When you salute me, you are simply rendering
respect to the power I represent; AND THE POWER I REPRESENT IS YOU. Now let me explain. You
elect the President of the United States, and the President of the United States grants me
a commission to represent his authority in this army. His only authority is the authority that
you vest in him when you elect him President. Now, when you salute an officer, you salute not
the man, but the representative of your own authority. The salute is going to be rigidly enforced
in this army, and I want you boys to get the right idea of it. I want you to know what you
salute and why.

It is very important that we should "get the right idea" of what our government is. It is very
much the idea that the officer gave his soldiers about the salute. It is the idea contained
in this chapter: that government is our own organization for team work in community life. All
through this book we shall be engaged in discovering how far this is true.

Do you know of instances in which the national government has helped to secure cooperation
among the farmers of your locality?

Discuss the parcel post as a means of cooperation.

During the war with Germany the United States government assumed control of all the railroads
of the country. Show how this was to secure better cooperation.

Is the government of your school democratic? Explain your answer. Do you think it should be
made more democratic? Why?

Compare the purposes stated in the preamble to the Constitution with the common purposes stated
on page 6 of Chapter I.

Show how the pupil who does as he pleases in school may interfere with the rights and liberties
of other pupils. Is it right that his liberty should then be restricted? Why? Is liberty the
right to do as one pleases? If not, what is it?

Read together in class the preamble to the Constitution and carefully discuss the meaning of
each phrase.

CHAPTER V

WHAT IS CITIZENSHIP?

WHAT MEMBERSHIP MEANS

Before we go further, let us get a definite idea of what it means to be a citizen.

IN THE BODY

We have frequently referred to the fact that we are "members" of various communities. Our bodies
have members, such as arms and hands. The tongue has been called an unruly member. "It is a
little member and boasteth great things." [Footnote: James iii: 5.]

There are two important facts about members of the body. One is THAT THEY GET THEIR LIFE FROM
THE BODY. If the hand is cut off, it quickly ceases to be a hand because it is severed from
the source of life. If the body is seriously ill, its members are unable to perform their proper
work.

The second important fact is THAT THE BODY IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS MEMBERS FOR ITS LIFE. If the
hand is cut off, or an eye put out, the body does not necessarily die, but it is seriously
handicapped. If a member is paralyzed or diseased it may be a positive hindrance to the body,
and the disease may spread to other members. The body may suffer merely because its members
are poorly trained.

IN THE COMMUNITY

That is what it means to be a member of the body; and membership in a family, or a school,
or a club, or a community, is just the same. We have already seen, and we shall see more fully
as we go on with our study, how completely we are dependent upon our communities for food,
for the protection of life, for education, and for all else that makes up our life. The community
that does not provide for its members in these things is like a sick body. On the other hand,
as members of a community we are always contributing something to its life--either to its advantage
or disadvantage. Of course, each of us is only one of a great many members in a large community,
and we may seem to be very unimportant. But each performs his part, whether it be great or
small, and whether he does it well or poorly.

CITIZENSHIP MEANS MEMBERSHIP

Now we often speak of members of a community as CITIZENS of that community. CITIZENSHIP means
practically the same thing as membership in the community. As a good community is one that
provides well for its members, so the good citizen is the member who does well his part in
the life of the community. A bad citizen is the member who hinders the progress of the community
when he might be helping. A citizen has certain RIGHTS and certain DUTIES. His rights are what
the community owes him; his duties are what he owes the community.

TRAINED AND UNTRAINED CITIZENS

There are many members of communities who are like the diseased or paralyzed hand, or like
the hand that is untrained. A member of an athletic team who does not "train" will probably
be dropped from the team--he fails to become an athlete. A member of a community, or a citizen,
who does not "train" still remains a member, but an inefficient one. He is a handicap to his
community and interferes with community team work. The part that a member plays in community
life may be more important than he realizes. Even in small things, "the falling short of one
may mean disaster to many." Each member of a community, like each member of a body, must be
not only in a healthy condition but also well trained.

WHO ARE CITIZENS

Let us not make the mistake of thinking that we are not yet citizens because we are young.
(that is, subject to its laws) "are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein
they reside." Even persons born in foreign countries and who have not yet been naturalized
[Footnote: "Naturalization" is the legal process by which persons of foreign birth renounce
their allegiance to the land of their birth and pledge their allegiance to our government.]
enjoy almost all the rights of native-born Americans, and therefore have much of the responsibility
of citizenship. Until they are naturalized they are still considered members of the country
from which they came, and therefore as owing certain duties to that country which would be
inconsistent with their duties as members of our nation. Therefore they are denied certain
POLITICAL rights, such as voting and holding office. [Footnote: In a few states even unnaturalized
persons are allowed to vote after they have declared their intention of becoming citizens.]
These same political rights are denied to native-born citizens until they have reached maturity.
But we must not confuse this right to vote with citizenship.

Explain how the idea of membership as described in the text applies to your membership in the
family; to membership in a club; in a church; in a farmers' cooperative organization.

Can you be a member of your class or school without doing it either good or harm? Explain your
answer.

Read Romans xii: 4-8 and James iii: 5-8.

Show how an injury or a benefit to one pupil in the school may be an injury or a benefit to
the entire school. Give illustrations to prove this.

Show how a failure to save food, to buy savings stamps, or to perform other services that one
is able to perform, weakened our nation and other nations who were her allies during the war
with Germany.

Make a list of things you have done during the week for the benefit of your school; for the
welfare of your neighborhood, town, or school district. Do you do as much for your family,
school, or community as they do for you?

Turn to Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States (see Appendix), and read the
entire first section containing the definition of a citizen. Discuss the meaning of the section.

At what age does the native-born citizen acquire the right to vote? Why is he not allowed to
vote before that time?

What native-born citizens of the United States do not have the right to vote even after they
are of voting age?

CHAPTER VI

WHAT IS OUR COMMUNITY?

ELEMENTS THAT MAKE A COMMUNITY

In the preceding chapters we have often spoken of "our community." As a matter of fact, each
of us is a member of a number of communities. It is time to consider just what they are

Every community, of course, consists of a GROUP OF PEOPLE who occupy a more or less DEFINITE
LOCALITY. Much depends, in community life, upon the character of both the people and the locality
they occupy. But the essential thing about a community is that the people who comprise it are
WORKING TOGETHER (cooperating) under an ORGANIZATION (government) for the COMMON GOOD (common
purposes).

LARGE AND SMALL COMMUNITIES

A neighborhood of farmers with their families may constitute a community. In this case the
area occupied may be extensive while the people are few in number. Or the community may be
a city with a population very large in proportion to area it occupies. There are villages,
towns, and small cities of varying sizes both as to population and area. Each state in our
Union is a community and so is the nation itself because each is composed of a group of people
(very large in these cases), occupying a definite territory (also large), and having a government
through which the people are working for common ends. There is a world community, but it is,
as yet, very imperfect. The nations and peoples that comprise it have been slow to recognize
their common purposes and have so far failed to develop adequate means of cooperation, (See
Chapter VIII.)

Is your class a community? (Apply the definition given above.) What common interests does it
have? Has it any government or laws? Is your school a community? Apply the same tests as above.

Is your home a community? What are some of its common interests? Are there laws in your family?

What are some of the things in which your family and your nearest neighbors have a common interest
because of living close together? Do your family and your neighbors work together to provide
for these interests?

What are some of the things in which all the people of your city or village (or the one nearest
to you) have a common interest, and which the city, or village, government helps to provide for?

INTERDEPENDENCE OF RURAL AND CITY COMMUNITIES

A community of farmers has interests of its own, largely centering around farming activities,
or the social life of the local neighborhood. A few miles away is a village or city whose people
also have their own peculiar interests, such as the lighting of the streets at night, or the
building of a new high school, or the election of a mayor. Yet there are interests common to
both the farming community and the city community. The city is dependent upon the country for
its food supply, and the farmers are dependent upon the city for their market. Probably some
of the farmers send their children to the city schools. Thus city and rural communities are
bound together into a larger community with interests common to both.

In the early days of western settlement a community was founded in Illinois. It was an agricultural
community, but in the midst of it a village grew, which in the course of time became a small
city. One of the first settlers was a young farmer with a mechanical turn of mind. He began
experimenting to improve the methods of planting grain. The result was the invention of a corn
planter, the manufacture of which became one of the chief industries of the growing city, employing
hundreds of men and sending machines to all parts of the world. Another young farmer invented
a better plow than those which had been in use, the manufacture of which became another of
the city's industries. In those pioneer days each family usually made its own brooms, but one
young man in this community earned his way through the local college by making brooms from
corn raised on the college farm. The college cornfield disappeared in the course of time, but
on one part of it there grew up a broom factory employing a large number of workmen. These
city industries were thus literally "children of the soil," and the city's prosperity depended
upon the agriculture of the surrounding region. On the other hand, the city provided the farmers
with improved plows and corn planters, furnished them an immediate market for their products,
supplied them with goods through its shops and stores, and gave education to hundreds of farmers'
children in its schools and college.

NEED FOR RURAL AND CITY TEAMWORK

Sometimes jealousies and antagonisms arise between small neighboring communities, and especially
between rural and city communities. This interferes with the progress of both communities,
and of the larger community of which each is a part. It may be proposed to build a township
high school. It is natural that the several communities that comprise the township should each
want it. But the interest of the entire township should be considered in determining the location
of the school, and not merely the advantage of one local district as against others. It sometimes
happens that the people of a city are exempted from taxation for county purposes outside of
the city, although the benefits would be almost, if not quite as great, for the city as for
the country. This sort of thing serves to set off city and country against each other instead
of binding them together to their mutual advantage. The case of Christian County, Kentucky,
described in Chapter III, is an excellent illustration of teamwork between city and country
in the interest of the entire county, and of the results achieved by it.

SMALL COMMUNITIES UNITE IN LARGE ONES

In this chapter there are three maps of Dane County, Wisconsin, which show how small communities,
both rural and urban, are united into a large community, the county. Map I shows the school
districts and the townships which comprise the county. The city of Madison occupies the center,
and small towns and villages are scattered here and there. The country school is the chief
center of interest in each school district. Here and there through the county are high schools.
Each of these is a center of a larger irregular area, including a number of school districts
and parts of several townships as shown in map 2. Map 3 shows TRADE AREAS. Trade and education
are two of the chief interests that bind people into communities. But where these interests
exist, there are likely to be other interests; the high school is likely to be a meeting place
for social and recreational purposes.

The area and boundaries of a "farming" or "rural neighborhood" community are usually rather
indefinite and changeable, depending upon surface features and upon transportation conditions,
or the length of the "day's haul." With improved roads and better means of transportation,
larger areas and more people are included. A "neighborhood" or "trade area" with automobiles
is much larger than one where horses or ox carts are used exclusively. The consolidated school
with transportation provided for pupils expands the rural neighborhood community.

COMMON INTERESTS OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY

Each of the small dots on map 3 represents a farm home. If we select one of these dots and
imagine ourselves members of the family that lives there, we shall see that we are members
of a certain school district, of a certain township, of a community that has grown up around
a trade center and a high school, and of course of the county as a whole. No matter in what
school district we live, we have an interest in some matters in common with the people of all
other school districts in the county. For example, there is a state university at Madison,
and connected with it is a training school for teachers. The work done here influences the
teaching in all the schools of the county, and indeed of the whole state. There is also an
agricultural college at the state university which serves the farmers throughout the entire
county and state. If we look closely at map 3, we shall see how highways and railroads center
at Madison, which is the county seat of Dane County and the capital of the state of Wisconsin.

Just as the many small communities that make up a county are dependent upon one another, requiring
organized cooperation for the county welfare, so all the counties of a state, and all the people
who live in all the counties, are interdependent in many ways. The people of the city of Madison,
for example, depend for their food supply upon the farmers not only of Dane County but of the
entire state. The university at Madison serves not Dane County alone, but the people of all
the counties of the state. The public schools of the state should be equally good in all counties
and managed by a uniform plan. Roads and other means of transportation are a matter of concern
to the entire state. And so the state is a community, organized with a government, to secure
cooperation among all the people and all the smaller communities that compose it. In fact,
a large part of the business of the governments of the local communities, such as city and
county and township, is to administer the laws of the central state government.

In a similar manner, the forty-eight states of the Union, with all the counties and smaller
communities of which they consist, comprise our great national community, of which we are all
members.

COMMUNITIES IN THE LARGER COMMUNITIES

When we speak of "our community" we are likely to think at once of the small community immediately
around us--our neighborhood, village, or city. Our citizenship in these local communities is
extremely important, and will demand no small part of our attention. But it is equally important
to be fully alive to our citizenship in the larger communities. This is true wherever we live;
but there is a sense in which our national community is peculiarly important to those of us
who live in rural communities. The wants of people in cities are, as a rule, looked after more
completely by their local governments than is the case in rural communities.

The people of rural communities, and especially farmers themselves, are directly served by
the national government in a great variety of ways. In the next chapter we shall consider our
nation as a community.

Show how the different classes of your school are bound together by interests common to the
entire school. Compare this union of classes with the union of states into a nation. What constitutes
the government of your school?

Mention some things in which all the people of your county have a special interest. Are these
things of equal interest to farmers and townspeople?

Do the farmers and townspeople of your county work well together, or are there conflicts between
them? If there are conflicts, what are the causes?

Point out some ways in which the prosperity and welfare of the farmers of your locality depend
upon a neighboring city or town. Also some ways in which, the city or town depend upon the
neighboring farmers.

If there is organized cooperation in your county, similar to that described on page 32, has
it been brought about or encouraged by government, or solely by voluntary effort on the part
of citizens? If the government had anything to do with it, was it the county government, state
government, or national government?

Has farmland increased or decreased in value in your locality since your father was a boy?
Can you show a relation between this change in value of farmland and the growth of nearby towns
or cities?

What industries in your town (or a neighboring town) are dependent upon farming for their raw
materials? for the sale of their product?

What is the cotton gin? the spinning jenny? Show how these inventions were a benefit to agriculture.
How did they promote the growth of cities?

Make a map of your school district. Do the people of this district cooperate in matters other
than those pertaining to the school?

On a map of your county, show approximately the "trade area" served by the "trade center" nearest
you. For what other purposes besides trade do the farmers of this trade area come to the trade
center?

On a map of your county, show the area from which pupils come to the high school nearest you.

On a map of your state, show the principle "railroad centers." Show how these are the centers
of larger trade areas corresponding to the small trade areas of your county. Show how the farmers
and the residents of these railroad centers have common interests.

CHAPTER VII

OUR NATIONAL COMMUNITY

IMPERFECTIONS OF OUR NATIONAL COMMUNITY

It is important to get in the habit of thinking of our nation as a community, just as we think
of our school or town or rural neighborhood as one. This is not always easy to do because of
its huge size and complicated character. It would be wrong, too, to get the idea that it is
a perfect community--none of our communities is perfect. Conflicts of interest are often more
apparent than community of interest. Teamwork among the different parts and groups that make
up our nation is often very poor. Although our government is a wonderfully good one, it is
still only an imperfect means of cooperation. Our nation is far from being a complete democracy,
for there are many people in it who do not have the full enjoyment of life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness; and large numbers of our "self-governing" people really have little or
no part in government.

LOYALTY TO IDEALS

It need not give us an unpatriotic feeling to acknowledge the imperfections of our nation or
of our government; for communities GROW, not only in size, but also in ability to perform their
proper work, just as individuals do. We call a person conceited who thinks that he is perfect,
especially if he boasts of it. But his conceit is itself an imperfection and a hindrance to
growth. So the patriotic citizen is not one who is unable to see defects in his community,
or who refuses to acknowledge them, but one who has high CIVIC IDEALS and is loyal to them,
who understands in what respects these ideals have not been reached, and who, as a member of
the community, contributes everything he can to keep it growing in THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

"The problem of government is, after all, the problem of human growth. ... The one constant
and inconstant quantity with which man must deal is man--changing, inert, impulsive, limited,
sympathetic, selfish, aspiring man. His institutions, whether social or political, must come
out of his wants and out of his capacities. Luther Burbank has not yet made grapes to grow
on thorns or figs on thistles. Neither has any system of government made all men wise..."--FRANKLIN
K. LANE.

WELDING OF THE NATION BY WAR

It is easier now than usual to think of our nation as a community, because the war with Germany
served to arouse our "national spirit," and showed very clearly the importance in our national
life of those elements which characterize all community life-- common purpose, interdependence,
and organized, cooperation (see Chapters I-III). The creation of a National Army did much to
bring this about.

When the benefits which come to the nation through the creation of the National Army are catalogued,
the fact that it has welded the country into a homogeneous society, [Footnote: "Homogeneous
society"--a society or community all of whose parts and members have like purposes and interests.]
seeking the same national ends and animated by the same national ideals, will overtop all other
advantages. The organization of the selected Army fuses the thousand separate elements making
up the United States into one steel-hard mass. Men of the North, South, East, and West meet
and mingle, and on the anvil of war become citizens worthy of the liberty won by the first
American armies. [Footnote: Major Granville R. Fortesque, in National Geographic Magazine,
Dec., 1917]. How this welding of the parts of the nation together was brought about by the
war is suggested by the words of an old Confederate soldier who wrote to a friend in the North:

"During the war between the states I was a rebel, and continued one in heart until this great
war. But now I am a devoted follower of Uncle Sam and endorse him in every respect."

DIVERSE ELEMENTS IN OUR NATION

The fact that our nation contained in its population large numbers of people from practically
every country of Europe caused no little anxiety when we entered the European war. Our population
embraces a hundred different races and nationalities. Of these, ten million are negroes and
three hundred thirty-six thousand are Indians. Thirty-three million are of foreign parentage,
and of these, thirteen million are foreign-born. Five million do not speak English, and there
are one thousand five hundred news papers in the United States printed in foreign languages.
Five and one- half million above the age of ten years, including both foreign and native, cannot
read or write in any language. New York City has a larger Hebrew population than any other
city in the world, contains more Italians than Rome, and its German population is the fourth
largest among the cities of the world. Pittsburgh has more Serbs than the capital of Serbia.
It is said that there were more Greeks subject to draft in the American army than there were
in the entire army of Greece. Would all these people be loyal to our nation, or would they
divide it against itself?

LOYALTY OF DIVERSE ELEMENTS

The war, in fact, showed us that there were some among us who had never really become "members"
of our nation and who were dangerous to our peace and safety. It also showed us the danger
that comes from the presence of so many illiterates, or of those who cannot use the English
language; for such people, even though loyal in spirit to the United States, cannot understand
instructions either in the army or in industry, and otherwise prevent effective cooperation.
And yet the most striking thing that the war showed us in regard to this mixed population is
that the great mass of it, regardless of color or place of birth, is really American in spirit
and loyal to our flag and the ideas which it represents.

NATIONAL SAFETY DEPENDS ON HARMONY

Another weakness within our nation that the war emphasized is the lack of harmony between wage
earners and their employers. There were many sharp conflicts between them. Strikes occurred,
or were threatened, in factories, shipyards, mines, and railroads, that blocked the wheels
of industry at a time when the nation needed to strain every nerve to provide the materials
of war. This lack of harmony between workmen and employers, which in war threatened our national
safety, has existed for many years and has always been an obstacle to national progress. But
the common purpose of winning the war caused employers and wage earners, in most cases, to
adjust their differences. In nearly every case, one side or the other, or both sides, yielded
certain points and agreed not to dispute over others, at least for the period of the war. The
national government did much to bring this about by the creation of labor adjustment boards
to hear complaints from either side and to settle disputes. If our national community life
is to develop in a wholesome way, complete cooperation between workmen and employers must be
secured and made permanent on the basis of interests that are common to both.

THE EFFECT OF A COMMON PURPOSE

Such facts as these show how easy it is, in a huge, complex community like our nation, for
conflicts to arise among different sections and groups of the population; and how difficult
it is always to see the common interests that exist. But they also show how such conflicts
tend to disappear when a situation arises which forces us to think of the common interests
instead of the differences. All else was forgotten in the common purpose to "win the war."
No sacrifice was too great on the part of any individual in order that this national purpose
might be served. Everywhere throughout the country, in cities and in remote rural districts,
service flags in the windows testified that the homes of the land were offering members that
the nation and its ideals might live. Men, women, and even children contributed their work
and their savings and denied themselves customary comforts to help win the war. THE ENTIRE
NATION WAS WORKING TOGETHER FOR A COMMON PURPOSE.

OUR NATIONAL PURPOSE

We have said that this common purpose was to "win the war." But there were purposes that lie
much deeper than this, without which it would not have been worth while to enter the war at
all. As we saw in Chapter I, our nation is founded on a belief in the right of every one to
life and physical well-being; to be secure in one's rightful possessions; to freedom of thought--education,
free speech, a free press; to freedom of religion; to happiness in pleasant surroundings and
a wholesome social life; and, above all, to a voice in the government which exists to protect
these rights. It was to secure a larger freedom to enjoy these rights, "for ourselves first
and for all others in their time," that our nation was solidly united against the enemy that
threatened it from without. But it was with this same purpose that the War of Independence
was fought, that our Constitution was adopted, that slavery was abolished, that millions of
people from foreign lands have come to our shores. It is this common purpose that makes the
great mass of foreigners in our country Americans, ready to fight for America, if necessary
even against the land of their birth. It is this for which the American flag stands at all
times, whether in peace or in war.

NATIONAL INTERDEPENDENCE

The attempt to work together in the war made it very apparent how dependent the nation is upon
all its parts, and how dependent each part is upon all the others. It was often said that "the
farmers would win the war." At other times it was said to be ships, or fuel, or airplanes,
or railroad transportation, or trained scientists and technical workers. The truth is, of course,
that all these things and many more were absolutely necessary, and that no one of them would
have been of much value without all the others.

It is true that the winning of the war depended upon the farmers, because they are the producers
of the food and of the raw materials for textiles without which the nation and every group
and person in it would have been helpless. But the farmer could not supply food to the nation
without machinery for its production, and without city markets and railroads and ships for
its distribution. Machinery could not be made, nor ships and locomotives built, without steel.
For the manufacture of steel there must be iron and fuel and tungsten and other materials.
And for all these things there must be inventors and skilled mechanics, and to produce these
there must be schools. And so we could go on indefinitely to show how the war made us feel
our interdependence. What we need to understand, however, is that THIS INTERDEPENDENCE IS CHARACTERISTIC
OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE AT ALL TIMES; the war only made us feel it more keenly.

NATION-BUILDING IN WAR TIME

During the war, strange as it may seem, while we were devoting our national energies to the
work of destruction incident to war, we as a nation made astonishing progress in many ways
other than in the art of war--in what we might call nation-building.

In some ways we made progress in a year or two that under ordinary circumstances might have
required a generation. A striking illustration of this is in the development of a great fleet
of merchant ships at a rate that would have been impossible before the war. Beginning with
almost nothing when the war began, we had, in less than two years, a merchant fleet larger
than that of any other nation, and that in spite of the constant destruction of ships by the
enemy. The chairman of the shipping board of the United States government says that this is
because the necessities of the war made the whole nation see how much it depends upon ships,
and caused not only ship-builders, but also engineers and manufacturers and businessmen and
the Navy department of the government, and many others, to concentrate upon this problem, with
the result that we discovered methods of shipbuilding, and of loading and unloading and operating
ships when they were built, that will probably enable us to maintain permanently a merchant
marine, the lack of which we have deplored for many years.

In a similar way we discovered and brought into use valuable natural resources of whose existence
we had largely been ignorant and for which we had been dependent upon other nations. We made
astonishing progress in scientific knowledge, and especially in the application of this knowledge
to invention and to industrial enterprises. We developed a new interest in agriculture, and
learned the food values of many products that had formerly been neglected. We were led to attack
seriously the great problem of suitable housing for workmen, and had an important lesson in
the relation between wholesome home-life and industrial efficiency (see Chapter X, pp. 112-113).
Foundations were laid for the adjustment of the unfortunate differences that have long existed
between workmen and their employers. The war suggested changes in our educational methods,
some of which will doubtless become effective, to the great improvement of our public schools,
colleges, and technical schools.

We shall study some of these things more fully in later chapters. They are mentioned now to
illustrate how OUR NATIONAL PROGRESS WAS STIMULATED WHEN THE WAR FORCED US TO SEE THE RELATION
OF ALL THESE THINGS TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR NATIONAL PURPOSE. On the
other hand, failure to recognize this national interdependence means slow progress as a national
community. When the war began, our nation was said to be "unprepared." Insofar as this was
true--and it was true in many particulars--it was because in the times of peace before the
war we had not thought enough about the dependence of our national strength and safety upon
all these factors in our national life WORKING TOGETHER. And so, in the times of peace AFTER
THE WAR, if the purposes for which our nation fought are to be fulfilled, we must continue
to profit by this lesson which the war has taught us.

Recall your discussion of national interdependence in connection with your study of Chapter II.

Report on some of the important scientific and commercial developments resulting from the war;

THE "SUPREME TEST" OF THE NATION

The "working together" of all these interdependent parts is the important thing. "The supreme
test of the nation has come," said President Wilson. "We must all speak, act, and serve together."
[Footnote: Message to the American People, April 15, 1919]. ... The whole Nation must be a
team, in which each man must play the part for which he is best fitted. [Footnote: Conscription
Proclamation, May 18, 1917.]

THE NATION AS A TEAM

We had some suggestion on page 72 of how such national team work became a fact. "Do your bit!"
was the watch-word. It was splendid to see how personal interests gave way before the desire
to serve the nation. It is a thrilling story how the racial elements in our population forgot
their differences of race and language and remembered only that they were American; how employers
and employees laid aside their differences; how farmers and businessmen, manufacturers and
mechanics, miners and woodsmen, inventors and teachers, women in the home and children in the
schools, doctors and nurses, and every other class and group subordinated their personal interests
to the one national purpose of winning the war in order that "the world might become a decent
place in which to live."

As soon as the United States entered the war, Washington, the nation's capital, became filled
with people from all parts of the country who wanted to help in some way. Some were called
there by the government; others came to volunteer their services and to offer ideas that they
thought useful. Many came as representatives of organizations--business and industrial organizations,
scientific associations, civic societies. New committees and associations were formed, until
the number of voluntary citizen organizations eager to do "war work" became almost too numerous
to remember. They were all an indication of the desire of the people to do their part in the
national enterprise.

CONFUSION WITHOUT ORGANIZATION

But there followed a period of confusion. All these organizations and the people whom they
represented wanted to help, but they did not always know just what to do nor how to do it.
Each organization had its own ideas which it often magnified above all others. Different organizations
wanted to accomplish the same purpose, but wanted to do it in different ways. Often they duplicated
one another's efforts. A war could not be won under such conditions. But out of all this confusion
there finally developed order, and this was because the various organizations of people realized
that if they were to accomplish anything they must work in cooperation with the national government,
whose business it was, after all, to organize the nation for united action. In fact, it was
for this reason that they came to Washington. Many of them sought to influence the government
to adopt this or that plan, and sometimes succeeded; but it was the government that finally
decided what plans were to be adopted, and all of the effort of the numerous organizations
and of individuals must be brought into harmony with these.

NATIONAL TEAM WORK THROUGH GOVERNMENT

The period of the war afforded many striking examples of national cooperation secured by the
government. It may have seemed sometimes that our government interfered with personal freedom
to an unreasonable extent, as when it limited the amount of coal we could buy, fixed the prices
of many articles, determined the wages that should be paid for labor, took over the management
of the railroads and of the telegraph and telephone lines, and did many other things that it
never had done in times of peace. We expected government to exercise powers in war time that
it would not be permitted to exercise in times of peace. But it can be shown that even during
the war, the government, with all its unusual powers, did not "ride roughshod" over the people,
but sought to "make them partners in an enterprise which after all was their own." The nation
was fighting for its life and for the very principles upon which it was founded, and it was
necessary that cooperation should be complete and effective. This was what the government sought,
and it exercised its powers by inviting and obtaining national cooperation to a remarkable extent.

THE SELECTIVE DRAFT AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF TEAM WORK

Our national army was created by a "selective" draft, or conscription. Conscription had formerly
been looked upon with disfavor as a form of forced military service. A volunteer army was thought
to be more in harmony with a democratic form of government. But the draft is now seen to be
far more democratic than a volunteer army because it treats all able-bodied men alike, instead
of leaving the fighting to those who are most courageous and most patriotic, while those who
are inclined to shirk may easily do so. Moreover, the SELECTIVE draft means the selection of
men to serve in the capacity for which they are best fitted. In Great Britain, under a volunteer
system, and in France, under a system of compulsory military service for all men, thousands
of brave men went to the trenches in the early days of the war who, because of their training,
should have been kept at home to perform the vast amount of skilled labor and scientific work
which this war demanded. War industry, without which there could be no fighting, was thus greatly
hampered.

By our selective draft, on the other hand, while every man was expected to do his share, each
was selected as far as possible to do the thing which he could do best and therefore which
would best serve the country. It also sought to prevent those who had families dependent upon
them from going to war until they were absolutely needed. Thus the selective draft is an example
of government organizing our national manpower for more effective teamwork and with less hardship
than if it had been left to voluntary action.

TEAM WORK THROUGH THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION

The United States Food Administration was created by the President to carry out the provisions
of a law passed by Congress", to provide further for the national security and defense by encouraging
the production, conserving the supply, and controlling the distribution of food products and
fuel." The President placed at its head a man in whom the people of the country had great confidence,
because of his experience and success in organizing and managing the Belgian relief work, Mr.
Herbert Hoover. He gathered around him men familiar with the problems relating to the food
supply of the nation, and then proceeded to enlighten the country in regard to the nature of
these problems and to seek for the cooperation of the people in solving them.

As soon as he was appointed, the food administrator issued a statement containing the following
facts:

Whereas we exported before the war but 80,000,000 bushels of wheat per annum, this year we
must find for all our allies 225,000,000 bushels, and this in the face of a short crop. ...
France and Italy formerly produced their own sugar, while England and Ireland imported largely
from Germany. Owing to the inability of the first-named to produce more than one third of their
needs, and the necessity for the others to import from other markets, they must all come to
the West Indies for their very large supplies, and therefore deplete our resources.

If we can reduce our consumption of wheat flour by 1 pound, our meat by 7 ounces, our sugar
by 7 ounces, our fat by 7 ounces PER PERSON PER WEEK, these quantities, multiplied by 100,000,000
(the population of the United States) will immeasurably aid and encourage our allies, help
our own growing armies, and so effectively serve the great and noble cause of humanity in which
our nation has embarked.

DEMOCRACY A PARTNERSHIP

This illustrates how the Food Administration sought cooperation. It "made partners" of the
people, explained to them the situation, and asked them to help as individuals. It showed the
nation what it must do if it were to be successful in its undertaking. It is true that the
President had large powers to enforce observance of the rules outlined by the Food Administration,
but it was only in the exceptional case of the individual consumer and producer who refused
to cooperate for the common good that it became necessary to use the power. The method of democracy
is to point out clearly how the desired result may be obtained and to depend upon the people
to govern themselves accordingly.

After a year of the war a member of the Food Administration is quoted as saying, [Footnote:
In an article on "Your Wheatless Days," by W. A. Wolff, in Collier's Weekly, Aug. 17, 1918.]
"There's never been anything like it in history. ... We asked the American people to do voluntarily
more than any other people has ever been asked to do under compulsion. And the American people
made good!"

What was true in the unusual time of war is true to even a greater extent in the ordinary time
of peace. We have little to fear from our national government as long as we and those to whom
we entrust its management, always keep in mind its real purpose, which is to show us how to
work together effectively as a nation and to help us do it.

EVERY MAN COUNTS

All through this study we are going to observe how in the ordinary affairs of life our national
government serves us in this respect. One thing that we need especially to learn is that we
have a great national purpose ALL THE TIME, in peace as well as in war. In fact, PEACE IS A
PART OF THAT PURPOSE. We went to war because without it there could be no assurance of a lasting
peace. While we fought to defend our national purpose and our national ideals against a powerful
foe from without, this purpose and these ideals cannot be fully achieved by the war alone.
They can be finally achieved only by ourselves as we develop, day by day, our national community
life. To do this we must always keep in mind our great national purpose, we must realize our
dependence upon one another in achieving this purpose, and we must make our national team work
as perfect as it can be made. Above all, we must realize that, in peace as in war, EVERY MAN
COUNTS in our national community life. As President Wilson said:

"THE NATION NEEDS ALL MEN, BUT IT NEEDS EACH MAN. ..." "THE WHOLE NATION MUST BE A TEAM, IN
WHICH EACH MAN SHALL PLAY THE PART FOR WHICH HE IS BEST FITTED."

CHAPTER VIII

A WORLD COMMUNITY

Is there a world community? A world torn by war, as our world was from 1914 to 1918, may not
seem to give much evidence of it, and many would at once answer "No" to our question. And yet
such phrases as the "brotherhood of man" and the "cause of humanity" are familiar to us all.
We may briefly discuss the question in this study, because if there is such a community, we
are all members of it, and our membership in it affects our lives as individuals and as a nation.

WHAT THE WAR DISCLOSED WITH REGARD TO A WORLD COMMUNITY

The world community is certainly very imperfectly developed, but while the war emphasized its
imperfections, it also furnished evidence if its reality. Its existence depends upon the presence
of recognized common purposes and of organized teamwork in accomplishing these purposes, as
in the case of any community. The war disclosed conflicting interests among the nations; but
it united for a common purpose a larger part of the world's population than had ever before
acted together in a common cause. It disclosed an interdependence among the nations and the
peoples of the world that we had not thought of. And while it disclosed the weakness of the
world's organization for teamwork, it aroused us to the possibilities of such organization,
made us long for it, and brought us, as many believe, a step nearer to its accomplishment.

AMERICA'S DETACHMENT FROM THE WORLD

Separated by wide oceans, from the rest of the world, our nation grew and prospered with a
sense of security from the conflicts that from time to time disturbed the Old World. We early
adopted a policy of avoiding entanglements that might draw us into these conflicts.

A few years later, President Monroe issued his famous statement, known as the Monroe Doctrine,
which, recognizing the principle that Washington had stated, also denied the right of European
powers to interfere with the free growth of the republican nations of North and South America.
The United States has steadfastly held to this doctrine from that day to this.

NATIONS HAVE BECOME CLOSE NEIGHBORS

But great changes have come to the world since the time of Washington. The use of steam in
navigation, the submarine cable and wireless telegraphy have brought all the world into closer
relations than existed between New England and the Southern States in the early days of our
national life. Our government at Washington may send messages to European capitals and receive
a reply within ten minutes. The Atlantic has been crossed by airplane. The nations of the world
have become very close neighbors. The murder of a prince in a little city of central Europe
drew from millions of homes in America their sons to fight on the soil of Europe.

The war did not create this interdependence; it only emphasized it. But now that we are aware
of it, it will probably influence our lives to a much greater extent than before the war.

WHAT THE WORLD WAS FIGHTING FOR

The nations that were associated against Germany, occupy, with their dependencies, two-thirds
of the earth's surface and include more than four-fifths of its population. The governments
of these nations declared that they were fighting primarily, not for selfish interests such
as "ports and provinces and trade," but "for the common interests of the whole family of civilized
nations--for nothing less than the cause of mankind." [Footnote: Stuart P. Sherman, American
and Allied Ideals, p. 14.] Even if some of the governments were influenced to a greater or
lesser extent by selfish motives, they still recognized a common interest of the peoples of
the world, a "cause of mankind," and based their appeals upon it. The prime minister of England
said, "We must not allow any sense of revenge, any spirit of greed, any grasping desire, to
overcome the fundamental principles of righteousness." Faraway Siam declared that she entered
the war "to uphold the sanctity of international rights against nations showing a contempt
for humanity." And little Guatemala proclaimed that she had "from the first adhered to and
supported the attitude of the United States in defense of the rights of nations, of liberty
of the seas, and of international justice." ... All the peoples of the world are in effect
partners in this interest."

The avowed purpose for which the United States entered the war, and for which "all the peoples
of the world are in effect partners," is the same as that for which the American Revolutionary
War was fought, which was proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence, and for which America
has always stood--the equal right of all men to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"
and to self-government. Nearly the whole world was united against a few autocratic governments
that denied these rights.

AMERICA HAS FOUGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF OTHERS

At the time of the American Revolution the colonists had no desire to fight the English PEOPLE,
but revolted against the autocratic English GOVERNMENT of that time, which refused to recognize
the rights of the people. The English people had many times fought for these rights, and many
of them sympathized with the American colonists, The winning of American independence was a
victory for free government in England as well as in America, and the government of England
today is as democratic as our own. Another writer said, "We are not fighting to put the Germans
out but to get them in."

THE GROWTH OF HUMAN SYMPATHY

It has taken a long time for the peoples of the world to develop a sense of their common wants
and purposes. Differences in language, in race and color, in religious beliefs and observances,
in forms of government, even in such matters as dress and other habits and customs, have tended
to obscure the common feelings of all.

Increased opportunity for travel, better means of communication, and more widespread education
have greatly increased the understanding among peoples and nations, and have disclosed to view
common purposes and ideals in spite of differences. The fact that large numbers of people from
every part of the globe have come to the United States to live together as one nation has contributed
to the same result.

Give illustrations from your own experience and reading to show that differences in dress,
language, race, and customs make sympathetic understanding difficult.

What is meant by "America, the melting-pot"?

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

As the peoples of the world have become better acquainted, individuals and groups have tended
to associate themselves together, regardless of national boundaries, for the promotion of common
interests.

One example of this is the common movement of organized labor which has overstepped national
boundaries.

There is an International Institute of Agriculture, with headquarters at Rome, and representing
56 countries, the purpose of which is to promote better economic and social conditions among
agricultural populations of the world. Some of its publications are published in five languages.

Literature and art bind all the world together, and science knows no national boundary lines.
Christianity is one of the greatest influences for a "brotherhood of man." Differences in religious
belief have presented most difficult barriers to overcome, but there has been a steadily increasing
tolerance of one religious faith toward others.

These are only a few of hundreds of illustrations that might be given.

SERVICE OF THE RED CROSS

We have all become familiar, during the war, with the work of the Red Cross. No other organization
has done more to extend the feeling of common brotherhood in the world and the spirit of world
service. During the war a Junior Department of the Red Cross was organized, enrolling in its
membership about twelve million American boys and girls and organizing them for practical service
to war-stricken Europe and Asia. Since the war, the Junior Red Cross, whose headquarters are
at Washington, D. C., has undertaken to use its organization to promote correspondence among
boys and girls of different lands, and an exchange of handiwork, pictures, and other things
illustrative of their interests. The American School Citizenship League (405 Marlboro Street,
Boston) is encouraging the same idea, and there is a Bureau of French- American Education Correspondence
for a similar purpose, with headquarters at the George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville,

THE MOVEMENT FOR WORLD PEACE

Numerous INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONGRESSES have been held, the first one as early as 1843, and
in the United States and other countries organizations exist for the promotion of friendly
relations among the nations, and especially for the substitution of arbitration for war as
a means of settling international disputes.

Among such organizations in the United States are the League to Enforce Peace, the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, the American Peace and Arbitration League, the American
Peace Society, the World Peace Federation, the Church Peace Union.

What may be gained by correspondence between the young people of different lands?

The work of the Pan-American Union.

The work of the Red Cross in war and peace.

PAN-AMERICAN UNION

One of the most successful experiments in international cooperation is that of the North and
South American republics. The first Pan-American Conference, attended by delegates from the
twenty-one American republics, was held in Washington, D.C., in 1889. As a result of this Conference
the Pan-American Union was established, with permanent headquarters in Washington. Its purpose
is "the development of commerce, friendly intercourse, and good understanding among these countries."

INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT

To secure anything like effective teamwork among the nations for the common interest and to
substitute arbitration for war as a means of settling differences, there must be some kind
of international organization, and rules to which the governments of the nations will agree.
Civilized nations have always had their official means of dealing with one another through
their governments, such as the diplomatic and consular services. Alliances have, from time
immemorial, been made between nations, treaties have been solemnly agreed to, and a body of
international law has gradually grown up. But treaties and international law have frequently
been violated, and no international government has existed with sufficient authority or power
to force nations to observe the law or to keep their agreements. As a result of two peace conferences
held at The Hague in Holland, in 1899 and 1907, an international Court of Arbitration was established
at The Hague (The Hague Tribunal), before which disputes might be brought by nations if they
desired to do so. But there was no way by which a nation could be compelled to appeal to the court.

NATIONALITY AND SOVEREIGNTY

Nations have a strong sense of their NATIONALITY, and are extremely jealous of their SOVEREIGNTY,
which is the supreme power claimed by every nation to form its own government and to manage
its own affairs without interference by other nations. It is this that has prevented the development
of anything like a real international government that could control the conduct of national
governments, or that could require a nation to submit its grievances to any judge other than
itself. This has perhaps been the chief weakness of the world community.

A LEAGUE OF NATIONS

Many people have long believed that the self-governing nations of the world must sooner or
later unite, in the interest of world peace, in some kind of federation or league, with a central
organization to which all would agree to submit their differences. The war made it seem even
more necessary. Accordingly, the Peace Conference at Versailles at the close of the war included
in the treaty of peace a Covenant (or constitution) for a League of Nations. The treaty, including
the Covenant, has been ratified (March, 1920) by four of the five great nations associated
against Germany (France, England, Italy, and Japan; the United States being the exception),
besides several other nations. While the President of the United States strongly advocated
the treaty with the Covenant, the Senate did not approve of its ratification. Those in our
country who opposed the Covenant did so for a variety of reasons, but chief among them were:
first, the fear that the Covenant would cause us to depart from the principles laid down by
Washington and Monroe; and, second, the fear that the powers conferred upon the international
government would deprive our national government of some of its sovereign powers. The friends
of the Covenant denied that either of these things would be true.

Whether or not the United States should enter the League [Footnote: The Council of the new
League of Nations held its first meeting January 16, 1920, the United States, of course, not
being represented.] we shall have to leave for the statesmen to decide; and whether or not
the League will accomplish the desired ends, time alone can prove. But two or three things
may safely be said with regard to any really effective world government.

MIGHT DOES NOT MAKE RIGHT

When people live together in communities, each person has to sacrifice something of his personal
freedom in order that all may enjoy the largest possible liberty. The same is true of families
in a neighborhood, of communities in a state, of the states in our nation. There is no reason
why it should not be true of nations which are neighbors to one another. No nation has any
more right to do as it pleases than a person or a family has, IF WHAT IT PLEASES TO DO IS UNJUST
TO ITS NEIGHBORS. The only thing, however, that a nation can properly be asked to give up IS
BEING UNJUST TO ITS NEIGHBORS. We saw in Chapter IV that government and law increase rather
than decrease the individual citizen's freedom, and that it is only the "ill-mannered" who
feel the restrictions of a wise government. So, when we finally get a world government that
is good, it will be one that will increase the freedom of all "good-mannered" nations, restricting
only those that are "ill- mannered."

WHAT "AMERICA FIRST" MEANS

Moreover, when we finally get a league of nations that will really secure friendly cooperation
among the nations for their common interests, it will be brought about, not by sacrificing
nationality and national patriotism, but by STRENGTHENING them.

What is required is not less loyalty to one's nationality, but more sympathetic understanding
of nationalities and national ideals different from one's own, combined with a recognition
of the fundamental interests ... which unite them to each other. [Footnote: "Thoughts on Nationalism
and Internationalism," in History Teachers' Magazine, June 1918, p. 334.]

The only way to be sure of a perfect neighborhood is first to see to it that the homes of the
neighborhood are strong and whole some. No person can really be loyal to his neighborhood who
is not first of all loyal to his home. Thoroughly efficient townships and counties and cities
are essential to a thoroughly efficient state; and no citizen is loyal to his state who is
not loyal to his township, county, and city. The strength of our nation depends upon the strength
of the states that compose it, and real national patriotism cannot well exist in the heart
of a citizen who is disloyal to his state. The first essential step toward an effective WORLD
government is to see that our national government is efficient and at the same time JUST. The
first and best service that a citizen can perform for the world community is to be loyal to
AMERICAN IDEALS, which are becoming the ideals of an ever- increasing part of the world's population.

CHAPTER IX

THE HOME

"NO NATION CAN BE DESTROYED WHILE IT POSSESSES A GOOD HOME LIFE."

The home is the smallest, the simplest, and the most familiar community of which we are members.
In many respects it is also the most important. The quotation with which this chapter opens
suggests this. It will appear at many points in our study.

What do you think that the quotation at the head of the chapter means? In what respects do
you think it true?

Some cities take pride in the fact that they are "cities of homes." What does this mean? Why
is it a cause for pride?

Is your community (neighborhood or town) a community of homes? What is a "home"? When a person
is "homesick" for what is he "sick"?

May a good home exist in a poor dwelling? A poor home in a fine dwelling?

Is a hotel a home? May a family living in a hotel have a home there?

Is an orphan asylum a home? Would you exchange life in your own home for life in an orphan
asylum? Why? There are children who think an orphan asylum is a fine place to live; why is this?

The home is important (1) because of what it does for its own members, and (2) because of what
it does for the larger community of which it is a part. We shall consider first what it does
for its own members.

THE PIONEER FAMILY

Under the conditions of pioneer life the wants of the members of the family were provided for
almost entirely by their own united efforts. They built their own dwelling from materials which
they themselves procured from the forest. They made their living from the land which they occupied,
with tools which were largely homemade. They provided their own defense against attack from
without and against sickness within. Such education as the children obtained was of the most
practical kind, and was obtained by actual experience in their daily work supplemented by such
instruction as parents and older brothers and sisters could give. There was little social life
except within the family circle.

EFFECT OF COMMUNITY GROWTH

When other homes were built in the neighborhood a larger community life began. The neighboring
homes came to depend upon one another and to cooperate in many ways. The store at the crossroads
provided for many wants that each home had formerly provided for itself. The doctor who came
to live in the community relieved the home of much anxiety in case of sickness. The education
of the children was in part, at least, turned over to the community school. And so, as a community
grows, the home shifts much of the responsibility for providing for the wants of its members
upon community agencies.

DEPENDENCE OF THE CITY HOME

This shifting of responsibility for the welfare of citizens from the home to the larger community
is carried furthest in cities. Almost everything wanted in the home may be bought in the city
shops, and work that is done in the home for the family, such as repair work, dressmaking,
laundry work, and cooking, is likely to be done by people brought in from outside. Water is
piped in from a public water supply and sewage is piped out through public sewers. Gas and
electricity for lighting and heating are furnished by city plants. Since many city homes have
not a spot of ground for a garden or for outdoor play, they depend upon public parks and playgrounds
provided by the city. These are among the many so- called advantages of city life.

THE OBLIGATION OF THE HOME

When so much is done for the citizen by the larger community agencies, there is danger that
the family may forget its own responsibility for the welfare of its members in connection with
every want of life. For no matter how good the community's arrangements for health protection
may be, the health of every citizen depends more upon the home than upon any other agency (see
Chapter XX). No matter how good the schools, the home always has great responsibility for the
education of the children, both within the home itself and through cooperation with the schools
(Chapter XIX). No matter how many social organizations and places of amusement the community
may afford, the social and recreational life of the home is the most important of all and the
most far- reaching in its influence (Chapter XXI). No matter how excellent the form of government
in a community may be, its results will be very imperfect unless the government in each home
is good.

IMPORTANCE OF THE HOME IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

The home has especial importance in the rural community of to-day. The rural home is no longer
so isolated and self-dependent as the pioneer home, but the life of the rural citizen is much
more dependent upon efforts within the home itself than the life of the city resident. The
business of farming by which the family living is secured is carried on at home, and, as a
rule, all the members of the family have some part in it. It is a cooperative family enterprise
to a much greater extent than any other modern business.

In cities, in the great majority of cases, the work by which the family living is earned is
done away from home, and very often no member of the family except the father has any direct
part in it. There are numerous cases, however, where the mother and even the children go out
to work, and in such cases the home life may be seriously interfered with.

It would be hard to find a rural home in the United States to-day that is not near enough to
a schoolhouse to enable the children to attend it, at least for an elementary education. Unfortunately,
high schools are not yet easily accessible in all rural communities (see Chapter XIX). But
whether the education afforded by the rural school is of the best or not, the boy or girl on
the farm gets in addition a kind of education through the varied occupations of the farm life
that the city boy or girl does not get, and for which the city schools have tried in vain to
find an adequate substitute. It is remarkable how many of the successful men and women of our
country were raised on farms; and they almost always bear witness to the value of the training
received there.

So in matters of health, of social life and recreation, of pleasant and beautiful surroundings,
the rural home must depend very largely upon itself. The strength and happiness of the community,
of our nation itself, depend largely upon the extent to which the homes perform their proper
work in providing for the wants of their members.

Review what was said in Chapter II regarding the independence of the pioneer family.

Review also what was said in Chapter I regarding the growing dependence of the family upon
the community.

Gather stories regarding pioneer home life (a) in your own locality, (b) in the settlement
of the West; (c) in colonial times. Illustrate from these stories how the home provided for
the wants of its members.

Show in detail how the various members of a farmer's family take part in the business of farming.
Compare with a family in town whose living is provided for by some other business.

Make a list of the different people who come to the home of a family in town to provide for
its wants (such as the grocer's boy, the milkman, the postman, etc.). Compare with a farmer's
home with respect to this service from outside. This purpose cannot be fully achieved if it
is not first of all achieved in the home. One of the objections often raised to life on the
farm is that it is a life of drudgery, of few conveniences and comforts, of long hours, hard
work, and little recreation. Happily this is not so true as it once was. Labor-saving machinery,
better methods of transportation and communication, better schools, have done much to improve
conditions of rural home life. But occasionally there still come statements like the following
from some of the women in farm homes:

In many homes life on the farm is a somewhat one-sided affair. Many times the spare money above
living expenses is expended on costly machinery and farm implements to make the farmer's work
lighter; on more land where there is already a sufficiency; on expensive horses and cattle
and new out-buildings; while little or nothing is done for home improvement and no provision
made for the comfort and convenience of the women of the family.

If a silo will help to reduce the man's labor, a vacuum cleaner will do likewise for his wife.
If the stock at the barn needs a good water system to help it grow, the stock in the house
needs it too, and needs it warm for baths.

You see many a farm where there is a cement floor in the barn, while the cellar in the house
is awful. A sheep dip, but no bathtub; a fine buggy and a poor baby carriage. On many farms
a hundred dollars in cash are not spent in the home in a year.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HOME

These are not meant as complaints about the purchase of labor- saving farm machinery. Such
complaints would be short-sighted, for it is only by improved methods of farming that the means
and the leisure can be found to enrich the home life in every way. But the advantages gained
by improvements that increase the farmer's returns are largely lost if they do not at the same
time bring "happier lives" to the family as a whole. The farm home is not only the place where
the family living is EARNED; it is also the place where the family life is LIVED. Democracy
aims at EQUAL opportunity to enjoy "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"; "days of
dreary work" must be transmuted into "happier lives" for the women and children as well as
for the men. Unless this is done in the home there is little chance of its being done at all.

A story is told of a housekeeper in a farm-home in the West who saw in the sacred rite of old-school
housekeepers something more than scrubbing and polishing ... When her housecleaning was over
she knew just what linen she would need during the coming year, just how much fruits and vegetables
she would need to can or preserve or dry, just what clothing must be replaced or repaired,
and what dishes would be needed to keep her set complete. She not only made changes to improve
the appearance of her house, but planned and made the changes in her workshop which would save
steps and make her work as easy as possible. When her mind got to work, housekeeping became
a game, the object being to eliminate all unnecessary labor. Her benches and tables and sinks
were raised to the proper height and she became ashamed of the back- breaking energy she had
wasted bending over them. A high stool, made by removing the back and arms from the baby's
outgrown high chair, made dishwashing and ironing much easier. She has been housekeeping intelligently
a dozen years, yet each house-cleaning or stock-taking period she installs some new labor saver.

She not only makes her head save her heels, but she takes another kind of inventory which is
as well worth while. It is the inventory which we all need to take of ourselves to be sure
that we are making the best of our opportunities instead of drifting along day by day in a
rut. She searches out the hidden places in her soul to see if she is just as patient, as thoughtful,
as cheerful as she might be ... [Footnote: RECLAMATION RECORD, Feb., 1918, p.55, "Project Women
and Their Materials," by Mrs. Louella Littlepage.]

COMMUNITY COOPERATION AND THE HOME

In some rural communities the home has been relieved of much of the household drudgery by the
development of cooperative creameries, cooperative laundries, and other community institutions
to do work that was formerly done entirely in the home. In such cooperative enterprises, citizens
of the community buy shares of stock as in the case of the fruit growers' association. In one
community in Michigan "a vote was taken, the women voting as well as the men, to determine
the sentiment of the community on the establishment of such a laundry, and the vote was so
overwhelmingly in favor of the proposition that the Farmers' Club promptly called a meeting
to promote the enterprise." An addition was built to the cooperative creamery, which the community
already possessed, so that the same steam plant could be used for both. The farmers brought
their laundry when they brought their cream, and carried it back on the next trip. "The laundry
has been successful in relieving the hard life of a farmer's wife, and in addition has been
not only self-sustaining but a profitable institution." One of the women of the community says,

It has lightened the work in the home to such an extent that one can manage the work without
keeping help, which is very scarce and high priced, when it would be impossible to do so if
the washing was included with our other duties.

And another writes,

This change gives me two days of recreation that I can call my own every week and also gives
me more time in which to accomplish the household duties. [Footnote: "A Successful Rural Cooperative
Laundry," in the Year Book, Department of Agriculture, 1915, pp. 189-194.]

GOVERNMENT SERVES THE HOME

A great deal of help is now being given to the home by the government, and this is especially
true in the case of the rural home. The public schools, both in city and country, now consider
home making and "home economics" as worthy of a place in the course of study as geography and
mathematics (see Chapter XIX). State agricultural colleges are beginning to give as much attention
to these subjects as they do to soils and fertilizers and stock-breeding. Moreover, the colleges
conduct "extension courses," sending teachers trained in the art of home making to give instruction
to women and girls in every part of the state. They assist in organizing clubs of girls and
women to study various aspects of home making and housekeeping, and give demonstrations of
the most successful methods of cooking, of canning, and of other activities connected with
home life on the farm, as well as of labor-saving devices in the household. The state agricultural
colleges have the cooperation of the Department of Agriculture of the national government in
all this work.

WHAT ONE GIRL ACCOMPLISHED

In the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for 1916 there is an account of results derived
from home demonstration work in the Southern States. The following story of what Ruth Anderson
accomplished is a good illustration of the possibilities of this work.

Ruth Anderson, of Etowah County, Alabama, in her second year of club work, had an excellent
plot of one tenth of an acre of beans and tomatoes. She is the second girl in a family of eleven,
and takes a great interest in her club work. The family home was small, dark, and crowded,
and somewhat unattractive. One day a carpenter friend of her father saw her one tenth of an
acre and said he wished he had time to plant a garden. She told him she would furnish vegetables
in exchange for some of his time. ... After a while a bargain was made by which the carpenter
agreed to begin work on the remodeling of the house if Ruth would furnish him with fresh and
canned vegetables for the season.

The other members of the family were soon interested in this undertaking and worked willingly
to contribute their share to its success. When the house was partly finished Ruth won a canning-
club prize given by a hardware merchant in Gadsden, the county seat. Silverware was offered
her, but, intent upon completing the new house she asked the merchant how much a front door
of glass would cost, and learned that she could get the door, side lights, and windows for
the price of the silverware. In this way Ruth brought light and joy to her family with her
windows and door. To- day they live in a pretty bungalow that she helped to build with her
gardening and canning work. At the age of 14, in the second year of her work, Ruth put up 700
cans of tomatoes and 750 cans of beans. [Footnote: "Effect of Home Demonstration Work in the
South," in 1916 Year Book of the Department of Agriculture, p. 254.]

Ruth's home before and after she began her work is shown in the accompanying illustrations.

NATIONAL AID TO THE HOME

The national government helps in home making in other ways than those suggested above, and
through other departments than that of agriculture. In the Department of the Interior the General
Land Office, the Bureau of Education, the Reclamation Service, the Office of Indian Affairs
are all doing work to improve the homes of the land. So, also, is the Public Health Service
of the Treasury Department; the Bureau of Standards in the Department of Commerce; the Children's
Bureau in the Department of Labor. We shall encounter some of this work as we proceed with
our study.

CHAPTER X

WHY GOVERNMENT HELPS IN HOME MAKING

Our nation requires healthy citizens, intelligent citizens, prosperous and happy citizens.
The home can do more to produce them than any other community agency. Therefore the nation
is wise to look after its homes.

RELATION OF HOME CONDITIONS TO INDUSTRY

People cannot do their work well if they live in unwholesome or unpleasant homes. This was
made clear during the recent war. The lack of suitable living places for workmen and their
families was one of the chief obstacles to shipbuilding and munitions manufacture during the
early part of the war. England found this out as well as the United States, and one of the
first things both countries had to do was to take measures to provide proper home conditions
for those who were engaged in supplying the nation's needs. During the first year of the war
our Congress appropriated $200,000,000 to build houses for industrial workers.

The problem of securing good physical conditions of home life has naturally been greatest in
crowded industrial centers, but it is by no means absent in small communities, or even in the
open country. One writer describes a certain farmhouse where five people were accustomed to
sleep in one not very large bedroom, which had only one small window, and even that was nailed
shut, one of these five had incipient tuberculosis. These people were well-to-do farmers, living
in a large twelve-room, stone house and simply crowded into one room for the sake of mistaken
economy-- presumably to save coal and wood.

Many such cases could be described, not only in the more remote and backward regions, but even
in prosperous farming communities.

What is the result of this overcrowding and lack of proper housing in the country? Just exactly
the same as in the great cities--lack of efficiency, disease, and premature death to many ...
While the great majority of people subjected to overcrowding and bad housing conditions do
not prematurely die, yet they have a lessened physical and mental vigor, are less able to do
properly their daily work, and not only become a loss to themselves and their families, but
to the state ... [Footnote: Bashore, "Overcrowding and defective housing in the rural districts,"
quoted in Nourse, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, pp. 118, 119, 121.]

STRENGTH OF THE NATION DEPENDS ON THE HOME

Some of our states and many of our cities have laws to regulate housing conditions, but such
laws seldom apply to small communities. In cities where people live crowded together in closely
built city blocks, unsanitary conditions in one home endanger the health of the entire community.
There is also danger from fire, and vice and crime may breed and spread quickly and unseen.
The community is driven, therefore, in its own defense, to regulate the people's housing. In
small communities, and especially in rural communities, where homes are more widely separated
and in some cases quite isolated, it has seemed of little concern to others how one citizen
builds his home and what he does in it. Thoughtful consideration of such cases as that described
above, however, must convince us that it IS a matter of national concern what happens even
in remote homes. Both the physical and the economic strength of the nation are undermined by
unwholesome conditions in the separate homes of the land.

COMMUNITY PLANNING

Economic loss to the community may result not merely from UNWHOLESOME home conditions, but
also from INCONVENIENCE of location and arrangement of the homes. A good deal of attention
is being given to "community planning" in the United States and especially in England and other
European countries. Community planning includes not only provision for the proper location
and construction of public buildings and streets, for water supply, lights, parks, etc., but
also for the convenient, as well as wholesome and pleasant location of homes. Large cities,
like London, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, have spent enormous sums of money in city
planning after they have already grown up without plan. It has necessitated destroying old
structures and widening streets. Villages and small towns are in a position to introduce a
plan for future growth without this needless expense. Our beautiful capital city of Washington
has grown according to a plan that was carefully laid out before a building was erected. But
even in Washington one of the greatest problems the city had to face during the war was that
of providing homes for the enormous number of workers who came to the city to do the work of
the government.

PLANNING THE FARMSTEAD

"The need of careful arrangement in country homes is much more urgent than in city homes for
the reason that country people use their homes as the business center of their profession,"
says Prof. R.J. Pearce, of Iowa State College. "The farmer in his business center must not
only produce enough raw material to provide for him self and family, but he needs to produce
enough to feed and clothe the entire human race." "CONSERVATION OF SPACE must be taken into
consideration to obtain the greatest results from our high-priced land; CONVENIENCE must be
a prime factor when expensive labor is at a premium; and ATTRACTIVENESS must be one of the
chief motives not only to make farm property more saleable but to give greater enjoyment to
the owner and his family..." "A farmstead is, but a unit in a farming community, yet travelers
form an impression of the entire community by individual farm homes which they see in passing.
Therefore, not only financial consideration but personal pride and a feeling of community spirit
and enterprise should urge the farm owner to develop his farmstead according to the best of
modern methods."

What facts can you find in regard to what the government did to provide homes for workers in
shipbuilding or munitions plants during the war?

In many of the war industries preference was given to men with families in employing workmen.
Why was this?

In some rural communities in the United States a "teacherage" (home for the teacher) is provided.
Of what advantage to the community is this?

Is there a "housing problem" in your community?

Are there any laws in your state regulating the building of homes? If so, what are some of
them? Do they apply in your community? Are they carefully observed and enforced?

Make a study of the arrangement of the buildings on farms with which you are familiar, drawing
diagrams, and report whether or not they are well planned with reference to ECONOMY OF SPACE
occupied, CONVENIENCE, and ATTRACTIVENESS. Consider

(a) Are they properly placed with reference to the highway?

(b) Are they conveniently placed in relation to one another?

(c) Are they suitably protected from the prevailing winds? How?

(d) What makes them attractive or unattractive?

(e) Are the stables properly situated to protect the health of the family? How?

Must a home be large and costly to be attractive?

What impression would a stranger get in regard to the "community spirit" of your community
from the appearance of its homes? Would he be right?

THE HOME AND COMMUNITY STABILITY

Home ownership is one of the strongest influences that give permanence and stability to the
community. The census taken by the United States government every ten years shows that home
ownership has been decreasing throughout the country as a whole. The decrease has been greatest
in cities, but it is true also of farmhome ownership. In 1880 only 25% of the farms of the
United States were occupied by tenants (renters); in 1910, 37% were so occupied. It is true
that in the ten years from 1900 to 1910 there was a slight increase in the proportion of farms
owned by their occupants in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, and in a large part
of the West; but the increase in these parts was more than overbalanced by the decrease in
the South Atlantic and Gulf states and in the Mississippi Valley. The smallest proportion of
farm tenancy is found in New England (8%), and the largest in the southern states (45.9% in
the South Atlantic states, and more than 50% in the South central states). A large part of
the farming in the South is done by negroes, most of whom are either laborers on the farms
of the white population or tenants on small farms which they usually work on shares. And yet
the number of negro farm owners in the South has been rapidly increasing in the last few years,
though not so rapidly as the number of tenants. In 1910 negro farm owners cultivated nearly
16,000,000 acres of land in the South, all of which they have acquired since the Civil War.

EFFECTS OF DECLINE OF HOME OWNERSHIP

The decline in home ownership both in the cities and in the rural districts of the United States
has been observed with considerable anxiety because of the effect upon our national welfare
and upon the citizenship of the country. One writer says:

Farming is a permanent business; it is no "fly by night" occupation. ... No man can pull up
stakes and leave a farm at the close of the year without sacrificing the results of labor which
he has done ... The renter who ends harvest knowing that he will move in the spring, will not
do as good a job of hauling manure and fall plowing as he would were he to stay; nor does he
take as good care of the buildings and other improvements ...

The cost to the farming business of the country each year for this annual farm moving-week
mounts into the millions of dollars. And the pity of it all is that practically no one is the
winner thereby ... The renter loses, the landlord loses, the general community and the nation
at large lose. [Footnote: W.D. Boyce, in an editorial in THE FARMING BUSINESS, February 26,
1916, quoted in Nourse, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, p. 651.]

Tenant farming also places obstacles in the way of community progress in other ways.

The tenant takes little interest in community affairs. The questions of schools, churches,
or roads are of little moment to him. He does not wish to invest in enterprises which will
of necessity be left wholly ... to his successor. In short, he is in the community, but hardly
of it. [Footnote: B.H. Hibbard, "Farm Tenancy in the United States," in Annals of the American
Academy of Political and Social Science, March, 1912, p. 39.]

A family that owns its home feels a sense of proprietorship in a part of the community land.
The money value of a home increases in proportion to the prosperity of the community as a whole;
its owner will therefore be inclined to do all he can to promote the welfare of the community.
A community that is made up largely of homes owned by their occupants is likely to be more
prosperous and more progressive, and its citizens more loyal to it, than a community whose
families are tenants.

THE TENANT AS A CITIZEN

While all that has been said in the preceding paragraph is true, it must not be thought that
tenancy is necessarily a bad thing in all cases, nor that a man who does not own his home cannot
be a thoroughly good citizen. There are circumstances that make it necessary for many families
to live in dwellings that they do not own. Tenancy may be a step toward home ownership. A citizen
may have insufficient money to buy a farm, but enough to enable him to rent one. By industry,
economy, and intelligence, he may soon accumulate means with which to buy the farm he occupies
or some other. The increase in the number of tenants in the Southern States is due in large
part to the breaking up of many larger plantations into small farms which are occupied by tenants,
many of them negroes. That many of these tenants are on the road to home ownership is indicated
by the facts stated on page 117.

It is as much the duty of the home renter as it is of the home owner to take an interest in
the community life in which he and his family share, and to cooperate with his neighbors for
the common good. While he lives in the community he is largely dependent upon it, like any
other citizen, for the satisfaction of his wants. Its markets and its roads are his for the
transportation and disposal of his produce and stock. He gets the benefit of its schools for
the education of his children. He may share in its social life if he cares to do so. His property
is protected by the same agencies that protect that of his neighbors. He cannot, therefore,
escape the responsibility of contributing to the progress of his community to the extent of
his ability.

TEAMWORK BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT

It is as much the duty of the man who rents a farm as it is of the man who owns one to make
his farm produce to its full capacity, to protect the soil from exhaustion and the buildings
and fences from destruction. But on the other hand, it is the duty of the landlord, both as
a good business man and as a good citizen, to make such terms with his tenant that the latter
will take an interest in the farm and will find it profitable to farm properly. There must
be team work.

The landlord must be interested not only in his land but in his tenant. The tenant must be
interested not only in himself but in his landlord and his land. A system that favors the tenant
to the injury of the land is bad. A system that favors the land to the injury of the tenant
is equally harmful. Either system will result in the poverty of both the landlord and the tenant.
[Footnote: Dr. Seaman A. Knapp, quoted by Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones in "Negroes and the Census
of 1910," p 16. (Reprint from THE SOUTHERN WORKMAN for August, 1912.)]

The fact remains, however, that home ownership contributes to the permanence, the stability,
and the progress of a community. It is also a fact that conditions have developed in our country,
both in cities and in rural communities, which make home ownership increasingly difficult.
In another chapter (Chapter XIV) we shall see what some of these conditions are, and what our
government has done and may do to overcome them.

THE HOME A SCHOOL OF CITIZENSHIP

One of the most important services performed for the community by the home is that of training
its members for citizenship. The family has been called "a school of all the virtues" that
go to make good citizenship. It is a school in which not only the children, but also the parents,
not only the boys and men, but also the girls and women, receive training by practice. In the
home are developed thoughtfulness for others, a spirit of self- sacrifice for the common good,
loyalty to the group of which the individual is a member, respect for the opinions of others
of long experience, a spirit of teamwork, obedience to rules which exist for the welfare of
all. If these and other qualities of good citizenship are not cultivated in the home, it is
not in a healthy condition nor performing its proper service to the community.

Moreover, the exercise of these virtues in the home is not only training for good citizenship;
it IS good citizenship. If the home is as important a factor in our national life as this chapter
has indicated, then one of the greatest opportunities for good citizenship, and one of the
greatest duties of good citizenship, is that of making the home what it should be; and in this
each member of the family has his or her share.

Make a study of farm tenancy in your locality (neighborhood, township, or county).

How many of the farms of the locality are occupied and operated by their owners? how many by
tenants? What is the percentage of tenancy?

To what extent are the tenants men who were formerly farm laborers, but who by renting farms
are making a start on their own account? Is this a sign of progress?

What percentage of the tenants are white? negro?

To what extent are the tenants foreigners who have recently come to the locality?

Are the tenant farms usually rented for long periods or for short periods?

What is the system of tenancy in your locality (i.e. cash rental, working on shares, partnership
with the owner, etc.)? If more than one exists, which seems to work best? Why?

Is tenancy increasing or decreasing in your locality? What reasons are given for this?

Does experience in your locality support the statement that tenant farmers are less likely
than others to interest themselves in community progress?

If you live or go to school in town, make a study of home ownership in the town. (If a small
community, the class may study the entire area; if large, different sections may be studied
by different groups of pupils.) How many homes are occupied by their owners? how many by tenants?
What is the percentage of tenancy? Is tenancy increasing or decreasing? For what reasons?

Is there some section of the community where most of the people own their homes, and another
section where most of the people rent? If so, do you notice any difference in the general appearance
of the two sections? Do you think that the difference, if any exists, is due in any part to
the fact that some own and others rent their homes?

Is there a tendency for the farmers of your locality to move into town? If so, why? What becomes
of their farms?

Review the points made in the discussion of topics 4 and 5 on page 38 (Chapter III). Continue
to develop plans for cooperation in the home and school.

What does it mean to be "in training" for athletics? In the light of your answer to this question,
what would it mean to be "in training" for citizen ship?

CHAPTER XI

EARNING A LIVING

LIVING, NOT EARNING, THE END IN VIEW

The most conspicuous activities that we see going on in the community are usually those that
have to do with earning a living or the production of wealth. [Footnote: The activities by
which we earn a living are also the activities by which wealth is produced. It is important
to understand that when we speak of "wealth" we do not necessarily mean GREAT wealth. A boy
who has a fifty-cent knife, or a girl who has a twenty-five-cent purse, has wealth as truly
as the man who owns a well-stocked farm. The difference is merely in kind and amount. Food,
clothing, houses, books, tools, cattle, are all forms of wealth. ANY material thing, for which
we are willing to work and make sacrifices because it satisfies our wants, is wealth. Earning
a living is merely earning or producing wealth to satisfy our wants and those of others.] Indeed,
some people become so absorbed in the business of earning a living that they seem to be LIVING
TO EARN rather than EARNING TO LIVE. It does not do to forget that not EARNING, but LIVING,
is the real end in view. Unless we know how to use what we earn to provide properly for all
of our normal wants, the effort we spend in earning is very largely wasted.

Nevertheless, before we can enjoy a living it has to be earned, by ourselves or by someone
else; and the activities by which it is earned occupy so important a place in our lives, are
so closely dependent upon the community, have so much to do with our citizenship, and receive
so much attention from government, that we must give them some consideration in this chapter
and several chapters following.

IMPORTANCE OF VOCATIONAL LIFE

While young people are spending most of their time at school or at play, their fathers and
other grown people are usually chiefly occupied in the business of making a living or "earning
money."

[Footnote: Gold and silver and paper and wood are forms of wealth. Out of wood we make a yardstick
or a peck measure with which TO MEASURE QUANTITIES of cloth or grain. In a similar manner,
out of gold, silver, paper, and other materials, we make money, and for a similar reason, viz.
to MEASURE THE VALUE of wealth. When we speak of a FIFTY-CENT KNIFE and a TWENTY-FIVE CENT
PURSE, we measure the value of these articles. It would take thousands of DOLLARS to measure
the value of a well-stocked farm.

When we say that a boy earns a dollar, or that a man earns $4.00 a day, we measure the value
of his work or his service. If a man works for a farmer, he very likely receives his "board
and lodging" in part payment for his services; he makes a direct exchange of his services for
food and shelter. But he also probably receives in addition an amount of money, because with
the money he can buy clothes and other things that the farmer cannot give. He takes the money
and buys with it these other things that he needs to supply his wants. Thus money becomes something
more than a measure of wealth or of services; it is also A MEANS OF EXCHANGING WEALTH OR SERVICES.

These are the two uses of money. Money has value only because of what it represents in wealth,
and wealth is useful because it enables us to satisfy wants. These things are mentioned because
it is quite important that we should never forget that "money" and "wealth" are worth working
for only because of the "living," or life, that they help us to attain.]

Children are, as a rule, wholly dependent upon their parents for their living. But during their
period of dependence they are gaining skill and experience, in school and otherwise, that will
later enable them to earn their own living and that of other people who may, in turn, become
dependent upon them.

As adult life approaches, there comes an increasing desire for independence of others, to have
possessions, own property, or accumulate wealth. Our VOCATIONS, or occupations, by which we
earn a livelihood, come to occupy a prominent place in our thought, and to a large extent control
our activity. Doubtless most of those who read this chapter have begun to think more or less
seriously about what they are going to do for a living. Some may be already doing so, in part,
or helping to earn that of their families. Boys and girls who live on farms are especially
likely to have a share in the work by which the family living is provided; but most boys and
girls have more or less regularly "earned money," even if they have not considered it necessary
for their living. An inquiry in a large, first-year high school class disclosed the fact that
the girls of the class, quite as much as the boys, were thinking of their choice of vocation.
More avenues are open to girls to-day than formerly by which to earn their living outside of
the family; but even the management of a home is a business as truly as the management of a
farm or factory, and is an exceedingly important factor in the earning of the family living.

What part, if any, do you have in helping to earn the family living?

What have you done during the past year to earn money (a) out of school hours on school days,
(b) on Saturdays, (c) in vacation time? Tabulate the results for the entire class.

What vocation would you like to follow for life? Why?

If you have not decided upon some one vocation, name several that seem attractive to you. Why
are they attractive?

What do you know about the opportunities and the qualifications necessary for success in the
vocations you have named? How may you proceed to find out more about them?

What vocations offer special opportunities for girls and women to- day? How do these opportunities
compare with those when your mothers were girls?

Make a list of the occupations of the fathers (or other members of the families) of the members
of your class.

Make a list of as many occupations in your community (town or county) as you can think of.

DEPENDENCE OF THE PIONEER

Our dependence upon others for a living by no means ends with childhood. There is no such thing
as an entirely "self-made man," by which is meant a man who has been successful entirely by
his own efforts. It is true that the primitive hunter and the pioneer farmer were independent
of others to an unusual extent. But their living was a meager one, and they could not accumulate
much wealth. The very land that a pioneer occupies, even though it is extensive and fertile,
has little value as long as it is remote from centers of population.

Even if a pioneer laid claim to a large tract of land, he could produce little wealth from
it in crops if he could get no help to cultivate it, or if he had no improved machinery (made
by others); and whatever he produced, he and his family could eat but little of the product.
He could feed some to his few animals, and he would save some for seed; but anything that he
raised above what he could actually use would have no value unless he could get it to other
people who wanted it. If he could not sell what he produced, neither could he buy from others
what they produced to satisfy other wants than that for food. So the kind of living a person
enjoys, and the amount of wealth he accumulates, depend largely upon other people, and upon
the community in which he lives.

DEPENDENCE OF THE MODERN FARMER

Under present-day conditions, a farmer who raises wheat probably uses none of it himself. He
sells his entire crop for the use of others, while to supply himself and his family with bread
he goes to the store and buys flour that may have been milled in Minnesota from wheat raised
by other farmers, perhaps in North Dakota or South Dakota. In exchange for his wheat he also
gets clothing manufactured in New York or New England from cotton raised in Georgia or Texas,
or from wool grown in Montana. He buys a wagon made in Indiana from lumber cut in the South
and iron mined in Michigan and smelted in Ohio. Thus he earns his living by producing food
for other people, while the things he uses in living are the product of labor expended by other
people in the effort to earn THEIR living. We noticed in Chapter II how many people and occupations
were concerned in producing a pair of shoes.

EARNING BY SERVICE

While the farmer or other worker may be interested primarily in providing for his own wants
and those of his family, he can do this only by producing something or performing service for
others; and while each worker may be most concerned about WHAT HE RECEIVES for his work, the
community is most concerned about WHAT HE PRODUCES. Earning a living has two sides to it: rendering
service to others and being paid for the service rendered. It is as if the community entered
into a sort of agreement with the worker to the effect that it will provide him with a living
in return for definite service to the community or for the product of his labor. What we call
"business" is SELLING A SERVICE. It may be personal service, such as teaching, or prescribing
medicine, or nursing, or giving legal advice, or cutting hair, or driving a team, or running
an automobile. Or it may be purchasing, storing, retailing, and delivering things which have
been produced perhaps many hundreds or thousands of miles away. Or it may be raising foodstuffs
on the farm, or mining fuels and metals from the earth, or cutting timber from the forest.
Or it may be manufacturing-- buying materials and converting them into products serviceable
to others. Whatever it is, every man's business is also the community's business, and the community
has a right to expect industry and honest, efficient work from every worker.

Discuss the occupations named in answer to the two questions on page 26, from the point of
view of their service to the community.

To what extent is your father's business or occupation dependent upon the business or occupation
of the fathers of other members of the class?

Show how your father's business is also the community's business.

What is the price of land in your neighborhood? Consult your father or friends in regard to
the increase or decrease in price in recent years and in regard to the reasons for it.

LIVING WITHOUT EARNING

There are exceptional cases where people RECEIVE a living without EARNING it. One class of
such people is represented by thieves, gamblers, swindlers, and persons engaged in occupations
that are positively harmful to the community. Such people may be very skillful and they may
work hard enough, but they take what others have earned without producing anything of value
to the community.

Then there are those who are incapable of productive work because of physical defects, or through
the feebleness of old age. It is the duty of every citizen to provide, as far as possible,
during his productive years, for the "rainy day" of misfortune or advancing age. For those
who cannot do so, the community must provide.

Very young children are users of wealth produced by others. It is expected, however, that children
will in later years make return to the community for what they have received during their period
of dependence.

INHERITED WEALTH

Some people inherit wealth, or otherwise come into possession of it without effort on their
part. The wealth so received, however, has been earned by someone, or has come from the community
in some way. If the person who so receives it uses it in a way that is highly useful to the
community, he may in a sense earn it even after he receives it; but if he uses it solely for
his own enjoyment, without effort to make it highly useful to the community, he does not in
any sense earn it, and places himself in the class of those who are wholly dependent upon the
community.

UNFAIR COMPENSATION FOR SERVICE

On the other hand, there are people who do not get for their work a living that fairly compensates
them for the service they render by it to the community. If our community life were perfectly
adjusted in all its parts; if all the people clearly recognized their common interests and
their interdependence; if they had the spirit of cooperation and were wise enough to devise
smoothly working machinery of cooperation;--then the returns that a worker received for his
work would be closely proportionate to the service rendered by his work. That is, he would
GET what he EARNED, so far as wages or profits were concerned. But this is one of the particulars
in which our community life is still imperfect. Where so many different kinds of workers are
engaged in producing shoes, for example, it is extremely difficult to determine how much each
should be paid for his share of the work. What WAGES should be given to the different classes
of workers who care for cattle, make the leather, manufacture the machines with which the shoes
are made, operate the machines, mine the coal and iron for the production of the machines,
and so on? What PROFITS shall be allowed to the men who raise the cattle, to the merchants
who sell the shoes and the machines, and to the transportation companies that carry them from
the factories to the dealers? What INTEREST shall be received by the men who furnish the CAPITAL
necessary to run the factories and the farms? These questions relating to the DISTRIBUTION
OF WEALTH that men produce have proved very difficult to answer satisfactorily.

A very useful and interesting, but rather difficult, science has grown up to explain the PRODUCTION,
DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF WEALTH. It is called the SCIENCE OF ECONOMICS. Of all the divisions
of this science, that relating to the distribution of wealth is the most perplexing. It is
the inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the sense of injustice produced by these inequalities,
and sometimes a failure to understand what a fair distribution is, that have caused all the
labor disputes referred to in Chapter VII (p. 71), and the discontent sometimes felt by farmers
and other producers in regard to the prices of their products.

Have you ever heard any one say, "The world owes me a living"? Is this a true statement? If
so, in what sense do you think it is true?

Which do you think is the truer statement: "I have a right to a living," or "I have a right
to earn a living"? Discuss the difference.

A thief has been known to say, "I was brought into the world without my own consent; therefore
the world owes me a living, and I owe the world nothing." Is this good argument? Did the people
upon whom he depends for a living have any more to say about their being brought into the world
than he had?

What things are you using to-day that were not provided for you by others?

If a stranger should come to your community to-day to live, what are some of the things that
he would find already provided by the community for his use in making a living?

Name five important inventions and state what they have done for you.

Would you say that the world owes Thomas A. Edison and Luther Burbank a living? Why?

How are you indebted for your living to the pioneers who settled your state? to Robert Fulton?
to the men who built the first transcontinental railroad?

Can you think of some way in which your family is indebted for its living to the British nation?
to France? to ancient Greece? to the Phoenicians? to the people of Brazil?

Which is the greater, the debt of your family to the world or the debt of the world to your family?

What is a "parasite"? Could this term be appropriately applied to any of the people referred
to in the last few paragraphs of the text above?

GOVERNMENT INTERESTED IN PRODUCTION

Each citizen has a right to feel that the government is interested in his individual prosperity
and happiness; and it is, for unhappy and discontented citizens are seldom good citizens. But
the government represents community as a whole, and has the interest of the community as a
whole in its keeping rather than the interest of particular individuals. Its interest is primarily
in what each citizen PRODUCES, for it is upon this that the strength. of the nation depends.

THE "NATIONAL SERVICE ARMY"

He then appealed directly to every kind of worker in the country, and to the farmers he said:

The supreme need of our own nation and of the nations with which we are cooperating is an abundance
of supplies, and especially of foodstuffs.

The nation needs the productive work of each citizen in time of peace as truly as in time of
war, although when it is not fighting for its very life it is more tolerant of those who do
not contribute efficiently by their work to the common good. It carries them along somehow.
But such members of the community are a burden and a source of weakness at all times. Therefore,
for example, there are in most of our communities laws against vagrancy; that is, against willful
and habitual idlers "without visible means of support," such as beggars and tramps.

PROBLEM OF THE UNEMPLOYED

There are times when many men are "out of work." In times of business depression the number
may become very great, while in prosperous times the number dwindles; but always there are
some. It is often through no fault of their own; it is another result of the imperfect adjustment
of our community life. It often happens that while large numbers of men are unable to find
work in industrial centers, the farmers may be suffering for want of help. This may be merely
because there is no way by which to let workmen know where they are needed, or of distributing
them to meet the need. Or, many of the unemployed may be unskilled, while the demand is for
skilled workmen; or they may be skilled in one line, while the demand is in another line. Whatever
the causes, the "problem of the unemployed" is one of the most serious that the community has
to deal with. During the war the national government sought to overcome these difficulties
by the organization of an employment service in the Department of Labor, and state and local
communities established employment bureaus.

Who have been some of the builders of your own community by reason of their business life? Explain.

So far as you have observed, what boys have been most successful after leaving school--those
who make it a practice to do all they can for their employers, or those who have tried to do
the least possible?

Is it true in your community that the most useful citizens are those who care more about the
excellence of their work than about what they receive for it?

Are there many vagrants in your community? Are there laws against vagrancy? If so, what are they?

Are there often many men out of work in your community? If so, why is it?

Is it ever difficult to get farm labor in your locality? If so, how do the farmers explain it?

What experience have the farmers of your locality had during and since the war in getting labor
when it was needed? Did the government help them at that time? How?

It is of the greatest importance both to the individual and to the community that every citizen:
(1) should be continuously employed in a useful occupation, (2) should be free and able to
choose the occupation for which he is best fitted, and in which he will be happiest, and (3)
should be thoroughly efficient in his work, whatever it is.

THE RIGHT OF THE COMMUNITY TO INDUSTRY

(1) The community has a right to expect every citizen to be industrious and productive, for
only in this way can he be self- sustaining and at the same time contribute his share to the
well- being of the community. Doubtless all who read this chapter are desirous of doing useful
work. At the same time, it is easy for any of us to fall into the habit of thinking more about
what we can GET than about what we can GIVE. There ARE people who habitually seek to do as
little as possible for what they receive, or to get all they can for the least possible service.
This applies not only to idlers who live entirely off the community without any service on
their part, but also to those who have employment, but who seek to evade, by "time-serving"
and otherwise "slacking," the full responsibility of service. We sometimes hear complaint in
regard to public officials who draw good salaries without rendering adequate or honest public
service in return, and to such we frequently apply the term of "grafter." But the principle
is exactly the same when any person who has undertaken to do a piece of work fritters away
his time or "loafs on the job."

SATISFACTION IN SERVICE

After all, the chief return that we get for our work is not the wages or the profits, important
as they are to us, but the satisfaction of doing something that is worthwhile. If this pleasure
is absent from the work we do, no amount of money returns can compensate us for it. The happy
man is a busy man, an industrious man; and his happiness is more in the doing than in the mere
fact of money returns.

IMPORTANCE OF A RIGHT CHOICE

(2) The value of our work to the community and the pleasure that we derive from it both depend
to a large extent upon our fitness for it. It is important to choose our work carefully. There
are four important considerations in choosing a vocation: (a) its usefulness to the community,
(b) one's own fitness for it, (c) one's happiness in it, and (d) whether it offers an adequate
living to one's self and dependents. The last of these is, of course, a most important consideration.
What a person receives for his work ought to be determined by the first two considerations,
i.e. the usefulness of the work to the community and one's fitness for it. We have seen that
this is not always true. In such cases it often becomes necessary to make a further choice--a
choice between working primarily for one's own profit and working primarily for the satisfaction
that comes from important service well rendered. It is not always easy to make this choice;
but there are many people who have sacrificed large incomes for the sake of doing work that
the community needs and for which they consider themselves well fitted.

A CHOICE OF VOCATION IS INEVITABLE

Many people seem to have little choice in the matter of vocation. The farmer's boy has to work
on the farm whether he wants to or not; and many a man is a farmer apparently for no other
reason than that he was raised on the farm and has seen no opportunity to do anything else.
Other people seem to be forced into other occupations by circumstances or drift into them by
chance. But even in these cases there is something of a choice. The farmer's boy "chooses"
to remain on the farm rather than to take the chances involved in running away, or because
he would rather be at home than in a strange city. The discontented farmer might have chosen
to be a lawyer if he had been willing to make enough sacrifices to get ready for it; and even
now he "chooses" to remain on the farm in spite of his dislike for it because to do otherwise
would mean sacrifice of some kind or other that he is unwilling to make.

THE MEANING OF OUR WORK TO THE COMMUNITY

The pleasure and effectiveness of ANY work, however, are increased if its importance to the
community or to the world is clearly understood; for ALL productive work is important. There
is no more terrible work than that of the soldier in the trenches. No man would voluntarily
choose it for his own pleasure. But millions of men have gone into it joyfully because of the
results to be attained for their country and the world. Other millions of men and women, and
even children, on the farms, in the mines, in the shops, and in the homes, worked and sacrificed
during the war with Germany as they had never worked and sacrificed before, produced results
such as had never been produced before, and doubtless experienced a satisfaction in their toil
that they had never experienced before, because each one saw more definitely than before the
relation of his work to the great national and world purpose. An understanding of the meaning
of our work in its relation to community welfare goes a long way toward "transmuting days of
dreary work into happier lives."

FREEDOM, EQUALITY AND JUSTICE

The opportunity to choose one's calling, to decide what service one will fit himself for, the
right of "self-determination" with regard to what one's work shall be--this is what "freedom"
means. This is why men are happier when they are free. The "equality" and "justice" that all
men want mean EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE that which they like to do, and AN EQUAL CHANCE
TO MAKE A LIVING, or to obtain compensation for their labor or enterprise. It is for these
things more than for anything else that people have left old-world conditions and come to America.
The ability to make a living under conditions of freedom and justice depends in part upon the
common wants of the community, and upon the willingness of members of the community to pay
for the satisfaction of their wants enough to enable those who perform service for them also
to satisfy theirs. But it also depends upon the ability of the individual to make a choice,
and upon his willingness to spend years in preparation, if need be, to enable him to offer
a service of the kind he likes to render, and for which others are glad to pay well.

A DAY OF SPECIALISTS

We are living in a day of specialists. The very nature of our interdependent life makes it
necessary for each worker to do one thing and to do it exceedingly well. Even farming is broken
up to a considerable extent into special kinds of farming. Moreover, since the worker must
be a specialist, requiring long, special training, it is more difficult than it used to be
for him to change from one occupation to another after he has once started. Each person, therefore,
owes it both to himself and to the community to choose his vocation carefully, so far as he
has opportunity to make a choice. The schools are more and more making it their business to
give boys and girls the knowledge and the experience that will enable them to choose wisely
their mode of earning a living.

THE NECESSITY FOR TRAINING

(3) Whether a citizen follows a vocation of his own voluntary choice, or one into which he
has fallen by chance or by force of circumstances, he is under obligation to the community
as well as to himself to do his work well. In these days of specialization this inevitably
means preparation, training. If the community expects the citizen to perform efficient service,
it must afford him a fair opportunity for preparation. During the war the government made special
provision for training, not only for military service, but also for the industrial occupations
that the nation needed. Vocational training is now receiving great attention from the schools
and from government.

HASTY ENTRANCE UPON VOCATIONAL LIFE

As in the choice of a vocation, so in preparation for it the individual has his share of responsibility.
It is always a temptation for young people to get out into the active work of the world at
the earliest possible moment. The desire to be independent, to earn one's own living, to "make
money," is strong. It leads many boys and girls to leave school even before they have finished
their elementary education. In the great majority of cases this results in serious economic
loss both to the boy or girl and to the community. The charts on page 137 furnish evidence of this.

PATRIOTISM IN VOCATIONAL LIFE

We call it patriotism when a man gives all that he has, even his life if necessary, for the
good of his country, without stopping to consider whether or not he will receive an equal benefit
in return. There is no higher type of patriotism than that which prompts a citizen to perform
his best service for the community in his daily calling, not for what he can get for it, but
for what he can give. This patriotism is shared by the young citizen who is willing to defer
an apparent immediate gain to himself in order to prepare himself thoroughly for more effective
service later.

If your father had his life to live over again, would he choose the same vocation that he is
now following? Consult him as to his reasons.

What special kinds of farming exist in your locality? Is there a tendency in your community
toward specialization in farming, or toward general farming? Reasons?

To what extent is "scientific farming" practiced in your locality? What does it mean?

Make a study of the extent to which specialization is necessary in the industries of your town.

Does your school offer any vocational training or vocational guidance?

Is there a tendency in your school for boys and girls to quit before completing the course?
At what grades do pupils begin to drop out in considerable numbers? Why do they leave? What
sort of work do they do when they leave school?

At what ages does the law in your state permit boys and girls to go to work? Show how this
restriction of freedom now increases freedom later on.

CHAPTER XII

GOVERNMENT AS A MEANS OF COOPERATION IN AGRICULTURE

GAINFUL OCCUPATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

According to the census of 1910, somewhat more than 38 million of the 92 million people of
our country at that time were engaged in "gainful occupations"; that is, in earning their living
and that of the remaining 54 million people who were dependent upon them. Of the 38 million,
more than 13 1/2 million were producing wealth directly from the land, in agriculture, forest
industries, mining industries, and fishing. About 10 1/2 million were engaged in manufacturing
and mechanical trades, by which the materials extracted from the land are transformed into
articles of use. The remainder of the "breadwinners" were engaged in trade and transportation,
and in professional, personal, and public service.

IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE

Of the 13 1/2 million people gaining their living directly from the land, more than 12 1/2
million were engaged in agricultural pursuits. At the present time (1919) probably one half
of the population, including women and children, is directly dependent upon agriculture as
a means of livelihood, while the other half, as well, is dependent upon it for food supply
and the materials for clothing.

In view of the fact that agriculture is the source of the nation's food supply and of a large
part of the national wealth, and that so large a part of the people are engaged in it as a
means of livelihood, it is not surprising to find our government deeply interested in it and
performing a vast amount of service for its promotion.

STATE DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE

The government of every state in the Union has an organization to protect and promote the farming
industry and the welfare of the farmer. This organization differs in its form and in the extent
of service performed in the several states, due partly to the varying importance of agriculture
in the different states, and partly to the varying success with which the people and their
representatives have dealt with the problem. In some of the states there are departments of
agriculture, equal in dignity and power with the other main divisions of the government. In
others agricultural interests are placed in the hands of subordinate boards, bureaus, or commissions.
In some cases the officials in charge of the organization, such as the commissioner of agriculture,
are elected directly by the people, while in others they are appointed by the governor of the
state or by the legislature. Often the department is organized in numerous branches with specialists
at the head of each. Thus, there are dairy commissioners, horticultural boards, livestock sanitary
boards, foresters, entomologists (specialists in insect life in its relation to agriculture),
and others, to look after every aspect of farming. In a constantly decreasing number of states
the powers of the agricultural officers are slight and their work ineffectual; but in others
the organization is thorough and the work efficiently done and of the greatest value to the state.

DUTIES OF STATE DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE

In general, state departments of agriculture have had two kinds of duties: first, regulative
and administrative duties, such as the enforcement of laws relating to agriculture passed by
the state legislature, enforcing quarantine against diseased animals, establishing standards
for the grading of grain, making and enforcing rules for the control of animal and plant diseases,
and similar matters. Second, investigative and educational duties, such as the investigation
of animal and plant diseases, crop conditions, and other agricultural problems; and the distribution
of information to the farmers and to the people of the state generally, relating to agricultural
matters. Reports and bulletins on special subjects are published and farmers' institutes are
conducted.

AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS

The practice is growing, however, to transfer the work of investigation and education to the
STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS which have been established and are conducted
with the cooperation of the national Department of Agriculture. These institutions have a corps
of highly trained specialists and educators and are equipped with laboratories and experimental
farms where research may be carried on under the most favorable conditions. The agricultural
colleges not only educate young men and women within their walls in agriculture and related
subjects, but carry on EXTENSION WORK throughout the state for the benefit of the farmers and
the people of rural communities. With the development of these institutions the state department
of agriculture is left with almost purely administrative and regulative duties. This seems
to be the wiser plan of organization.

Write to your state commissioner of agriculture or to the secretary of your state board of
agriculture for a copy of the law, or other published document, containing a description of
the organization of your state department of agriculture and its work. Also ask for, if available,
a list of publications issued by the department, from which you may later select such as may
seem to be useful.

Write to your state agricultural college, or to the experiment station, for its latest report
showing the work that it has done, and for a list of available publications.

In writing to public officials for materials for class use, it is well to send but ONE letter
for the class or school, and to request THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF COPIES that will serve the purposes
of the class. Public officials are busy people, and the publications for which you ask cost
the people of the community money.

The members of the class may compete, if desired, in formulating a suitable letter, and a class
committee may select the best, or formulate one on the basis of suggestions from the class.

Materials collected in this way should become school property, and the class should be conscious
that it is accumulating a library for later classes as well as for themselves. Study and report
on the following:

The organization of your state department of agriculture, its officers and how chosen, its
divisions and their work.

The work done at your state experiment station (individual reports may be made on the several
important lines of work, or on particular investigations or discoveries of interest).

The character of the extension courses offered by your state agricultural college. Courses
given in your own community.

Instances of regulative work done in your state and county by your state department of agriculture.

Instances in which your county or locality has been served by your state agricultural college
or by the experiment station.

The difficulty of the farmer in coping with animal disease or plant disease by his own effort.

Facts to show that money has been saved to your community by the state agricultural department
or experiment station.

Why the people of the cities of your state should pay taxes to support the department of agriculture.

Facts to show that your state department of agriculture and your experiment station are really
"means of cooperation" in your state and county.

Extent to which the farmers of your locality actually cooperate through the governmental machinery
of the department of agriculture.

Consult your parents or farmer friends as to ways in which the work of your state department
of agriculture, agricultural college, or experiment station should be extended.

Sentiment among the people of your locality, especially the farmers, as to the usefulness of
your department of agriculture, experiment station and agricultural college.

Get information from your county agent, or from your state agricultural college, as to the
states having the best organized departments of agriculture, and then get information as to
their points of excellence.

The advantage of a state fair (A) to the farmer, (B) to the state. The fair as a means of cooperation.

The management of your county fair (if any).

AGRICULTURE A NATIONAL ENTERPRISE

It does one state very little good to fight hog cholera or the boll weevil unless neighboring
states do likewise. Inferior service in one state by its department of agriculture is a detriment
not only to the farmers of that state, but to those of other states and of the country as a
whole. States gradually learn from one another and frequently adopt from one another the best
methods that are developed. This is a slow process. The agriculture of our nation must be considered
as a great national enterprise, and not as forty-eight separate enterprises. This was made
evident during the recent war. Hence the necessity for national control.

EARLY NATIONAL SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURE

Washington and Jefferson, like other founders of our nation, took the keenest interest in agriculture.
But in the early years of our history little was done by the national government for its promotion,
except by a rather generous policy of disposing of the public lands (see Chapter XIV). In 1820
a committee on agriculture was for the first time created in the House of Representatives,
and in 1825 a similar committee in the Senate. In 1839 Congress made its first appropriation
for agricultural purposes, $1000, to be spent in gathering information about crops and other
agricultural matters. This was a small beginning when compared with the $37,000,000 appropriated
by Congress for agricultural purposes in 1918.

CREATION OF DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

The United States Department of Agriculture was created by Congress in 1862, though it was
not placed on an equality with the other executive departments of the national government,
with a member of the President's cabinet at its head, until 1889. While it has some very important
regulatory powers, that is, powers to enforce laws and otherwise to control the practice of
the people, its service has been largely by way of scientific investigation of the problems
of agriculture and the distribution of the information so acquired. Its policy has been one
of cooperation with state authorities.

NATIONAL COOPERATION WITH THE STATES

In 1862 Congress gave to the several states portions of the public lands, the proceeds from
which were to be used for the establishment and support of the agricultural colleges of which
mention has been made. Again, in 1887, Congress made appropriations for the establishment of
the agricultural experiment stations, which are conducted cooperatively by the state and national
governments. In 1914 the Smith-Lever Act was passed by Congress, making appropriations for
agricultural extension work to be conducted by the state agricultural colleges with the cooperation
of the Department of Agriculture. By the terms of this act each state must appropriate a sum
of money for the extension work equal to that received from the national government.

THE STATES RELATIONS SERVICE of the Department of Agriculture supervises and administers these
cooperative relations with the states under the terms of the Smith-Lever Act. In each state
there is a director of extension work who represents both the United States Department of Agriculture
and the state agricultural college. Under him there is usually a state agent or leader, district
agents, county agents, and specialists of various kinds. The county agents conduct agricultural
demonstration work in their counties and assist in organizing rural communities for cooperation.
Women county agents, or home demonstration agents, are rapidly being installed also, to conduct
extension work in home economics and organize cooperation among the women.

In the Southern States during 1915 about 110,000 farmers carried out demonstration work under
the supervision of county agents. Each such farm demonstration serves as an object lesson for
the entire community. These demonstrations included corn raising in 446,000 acres, cotton in
202,000 acres, tobacco in 2630 acres, small grains in 196,000 acres, and many other products
in hundreds of thousands of acres. Stumps were removed from more than 70,000 acres, 220,000
acres were drained, and there were 29,000 demonstrations in home gardens. Sixty-four thousand
improved implements were bought. Work was done with orchards involving more than 2,000,000
trees, 29,000 farmers were instructed in the care of manure with an estimated saving of more
than 3,000,000 tons. Farmers in 678 cooperative community organizations were advised with regard
to the purchase of fertilizers with a saving in cost of $125,000. One thousand six hundred
fifty-four community organizations were formed to study local problems and to meet local business
needs. Nearly 63,000 boys were enrolled in corn clubs.

There were also in the Southern States 368 counties with home demonstration agents, who gave
instruction to 32,613 girls and 6871 women. Each of the girls produced a one tenth acre home
garden of tomatoes and other vegetables. They put up more than 2,000,000 cans of fruit and
vegetables worth $300,000. There were nearly 10,000 members in poultry clubs and 3000 in bread
clubs. Two hundred fifty women's community clubs were formed.

Similar work was done in the Northern States, where 209,000 boys and girls were enrolled in
club work. Nearly 25,000 of these were engaged in profit-making enterprises in which they produced
food worth more than $500,000. Reports from 3155 homes show 546,515 quarts of fruits and vegetables
canned, about half of which consisted of vegetables, windfall apples, and other products that
frequently go to waste.

How much money does your state receive from the national treasury under the terms of the Smith-Lever
Act? (Discuss at home, consult your county agent.)

Find out from your county agent, and from your home demonstration agent (if there is one),
what their work includes and how it is done. Invite them to speak to your school on the subject.

What demonstration work is being carried on in your county for men and women? Results achieved?

With the help of your county agent, make a map of your county showing the distribution of his
demonstration work.

Report on boys' and girls' club work in your county. Describe particularly any such work in
which you are engaged.

What are some of the problems in regard to which the farmers of your community need help?

Make a report on George Washington the Farmer; on Thomas Jefferson's contributions to agriculture.

THE OFFICE OF MARKETS AND RURAL ORGANIZATION promotes the organization of rural communities
for cooperation in buying and selling, in obtaining rural credits and insurance (see Chapter
XIII), in developing means of communication (Chapter XVIII), and in providing for social needs.
It investigates markets and methods of marketing, and transportation and storage facilities.

It seeks to establish standards for grading and packing fruits, vegetables, and other products.

THE OFFICE OF FARM MANAGEMENT investigates and promotes the application of business methods
to farm management and farm practice. It studies the cost and profitableness of producing particular
crops, livestock, and dairy products, the use of the woodlot, the most economic and effective
farm equipment. It investigates the cost of the farmer's living, methods of keeping accounts,
the methods and results of tenantry.

THE BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY investigates the causes, prevention, and treatment of diseases
of domestic animals, and has done much to eradicate them. It studies methods of dairying and
dairy manufacturing, of breeding and feeding livestock, of producing wool and other animal
fibers, of poultry raising. It cooperates with the States Relations Service and the state agricultural
colleges in educational work, conducting livestock demonstration work and advising with regard
to the establishment and management of creameries and cheese factories. It promotes the organization
of pig clubs to stimulate interest in swine production.

THE BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY investigates the causes, prevention, and treatment of plant diseases,
including those of fruit, shade, and forest trees. It has introduced over 43,000 varieties
of foreign seeds and plants, from which many new industries have grown up amounting in value
to many millions of dollars each year. Its explorers have brought new varieties of cereals
from Russia and Siberia; alfalfas from Siberia; date palms from North Africa, Arabia, and Persia;
the pistachio nut from Greece and Sicily; vanilla and peaches from Mexico; barleys and hops
from Europe; rices and matting rushes from Japan; forage grasses from India; tropical fruits
from South America. It experiments in the breeding of hardy and disease-resisting grains, fruits,
and vegetables, studies soil fertility, investigates the medicinal qualities of plants, tests
seeds, and improves agricultural implements. Its experiments are conducted in experimental
gardens in Washington, D.C., at Arlington, Va., and at the experiment stations distributed
widely over the United States.

This bureau does much educational work, instructing farmers how to control plant diseases and
how to organize for cooperation in the breeding of disease-resisting plants, and conducting
demonstrations on reclaimed lands in arid regions. During 1916 it distributed, through members
of Congress, 356,000 tulip and narcissus bulbs, 96,000 strawberry plants of 15 varieties, 14,000
packages of lawn grass seed, and more than 16,000,000 packages of vegetable and flower seeds.

THE BUREAU OF CHEMISTRY studies the influence of environment on crops and plants; investigates
the quality of mill products, the methods of bread making, of tanning leather, and of paper
making. It tests the food values of all kinds of products, the keeping quality of poultry,
eggs, and fish in the course of transportation, and the composition of drugs. It is called
upon by other departments of government to make chemical analysis of many articles.

THE BUREAU OF SOILS investigates the quality of soils and their adaptation to different kinds
of crops, and the fertilizer sources of the country.

THE BUREAU OF ENTOMOLOGY is concerned with the study of insects and their relation to agriculture,
including those that are destructive to fruit, shade, and forest trees. Its work includes the
study and promotion of bee culture. It has carried on a campaign for the eradication of such
diseases as spotted fever, malaria, and typhoid which are carried by ticks, mosquitoes, flies,
and other insects (see Chapter XX).

THE BUREAU OF BIOLOGICAL SURVEY maintains game, mammal, and bird reservations, including among
others the Montana National Bison Range, the winter elk refuge in Wyoming, the Sully's Hill
National Game Preserve in South Dakota, and the Aleutian Islands Reservation in Alaska. It
studies the food habits of North American birds and mammals in relation to agriculture, horticulture,
and forestry, and the habits, geographical distribution, and migrations of animals and plants.
It conducts experiments and demonstrations in destroying animals harmful to agriculture and
animal husbandry and in connection with rearing fur-bearing animals. It cooperates with local
authorities in the protection of migratory birds.

THE BUREAU OF CROP ESTIMATES gathers and publishes data regarding agriculture, and particularly
estimates relating to crop and livestock, production.

THE WEATHER BUREAU is in charge of the forecasting of the weather, the issuing of storm warnings,
the display of weather and flood signals for the benefit of commerce, agriculture, and navigation
(see Chapter XVI).

THE FOREST SERVICE has in its keeping the great national forests (see Chapter XV).

THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ROADS AND RURAL ENGINEERING administers the work of the federal government
for road improvement, and studies farm engineering problems such as those relating to sanitation
and water supply (see Chapters XVII and XX).

REGULATORY POWERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

The Department of Agriculture has certain important powers of regulation and control. Animals
are inspected at market centers to discover the presence of disease, and localities infected
are quarantined.

In 1915 more than 15 million sheep were inspected and nearly 4 million dipped to cure scabies.
As a result nearly one and one half million square miles of land were released from quarantine.
In the same year more than a million square miles were released from quarantine against scabies
in cattle.

In quarantining a state, or portion of a state, the Department acts by authority of laws passed
by Congress under its power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce (Constitution, Art.
I, Sec. 8, cl. 3). By the same authority, all cattle for export and all imported from foreign
countries are inspected and those diseased excluded. Slaughter houses and meat-packing establishments
where meat is packed for interstate or foreign commerce are inspected; meat that is unfit for
use being condemned, while that which is good has the government stamp placed upon it. Such
measures are primarily health measures (see Chapter XX), but they have great economic value.

In a similar manner imported seeds, plants, and plant products are inspected to prevent the
importation of plant diseases and plant pests, and also to prevent adulteration of plant products.
Warehouses are inspected and licenses granted to those that are suitable for the proper storage
of cotton, grains, tobacco, flaxseed, and wool. The Department enforces the laws that fix the
standards for grading cotton and grain, and licenses grain inspectors. It also enforces the
Food and Drugs Act (see Chapter XX).

SERVICE OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT

While the business interests of the farmer, and indeed many of his other interests, such as
health, education, and social life, are especially looked after by the Department of Agriculture,
he shares with all other citizens the services of all the other departments of government,
each of which also has its elaborate organization (see Chapter XXVII). It is the Treasury Department,
for example, acting under authority given to it by Congress, that provides the people with
their system of money and with a banking system, both of which are great cooperative devices.
The Department of Commerce serves the farmer directly by discovering markets for his products
in every part of the world, and indirectly by everything it does to promote the country's commerce.
The rural mail delivery, the parcel post, and the motor truck service of the Post Office Department
are of untold value to the farmer (see Chapter XVIII). The Department of the Interior has supervision
over the public lands, the reclamation of arid lands, and the development of mineral resources
(Chapters XIV, XV).

THE QUESTION OF LABOR SUPPLY

The question of labor supply is one of the most serious questions which the farmer has to face.
It is one that he must help to solve for himself:

As soon as work on the farms is organized, and employment is made steady for all help, just
so soon will a better class of laborers be attracted to the farm. As the farm-owner wishes
life to be free from eternal drudgery for himself and family, yielding the fruits of happiness,
leisure, and culture, he would do well to consent and arrange to give the farm hand who shares
the shelter of his roof a fair chance at the same benefits. The laborer wants regular hours,
a chance for recreation, a good place to live in, and enough wages to maintain a family according
to American standards. [Footnote: W.J. Dougan and M.W. Leiserson in "Rural Social Problems,"
Fourth Annual Report Wisconsin Country Life Conference, quoted in Nourse, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
pp. 258-260.]

But there are aspects of the labor problem over which the farmer by his own unaided efforts
can have little control. One of these is the problem of bringing the laborer and the job together
(see Chapter XI, p. 133). The work of the Employment Service in the Department of Labor during
the recent war affords a striking illustration of cooperation secured through an agency of
government.

THE UNITED STATES EMPLOYMENT SERVICE

The Employment Service had been created in 1914, but was rapidly developed during the war to
meet the demand for farm labor to provide a food supply adequate to war needs. The main offices
of Employment Service were with the Department of Labor in Washington. But each state had a
federal director of employment, and branch offices were established in local communities. The
success of the whole scheme depended, first of all, upon cooperation between national, state,
and local governments.

Thousands of county agents and local rural community organizations discovered and reported
local needs to local employment offices, which in turn distributed the information by means
of the district, state, and national organizations. Fifty-five thousand post offices became
farm-labor employment agencies, postmasters and rural carriers acting as agents. Railroads
cooperated both in reporting needs for the districts through which they run and in distributing
labor to the points where needed. Newspaper offices served as employment bureaus. The operators
of nearly 8000 rural telephone companies weekly called up the homes of two million farmers
to inquire as to needs. State and county councils of defense, chambers of commerce, labor unions,
farmers' organizations, and other volunteer agencies afforded channels through which the farmer
and the laborer were brought together.

From January to the end of October 1918, approximately 2,500,000 workers were directed to employment
(not all farm workers). In that year the enormous wheat crop of the western states was entirely
harvested by labor forces organized and moving northward as the harvest ripened. "Teamwork
between the county agricultural agents and farm-help specialists of the Department of Agriculture
and the harvest emergency force of the United States Employment Service is considered largely
responsible for the excellent results." In a similar manner assistance was given in harvesting
the corn and cotton crops, the fruits of orchards and vineyards, and the vegetable crops of
the country.

The Boys' Working Reserve constituted one division of the Employment Service. In 1918, 210,000
boys between the ages of 16 and 20 were enrolled for work on the farms during the summer. The
Reserve was responsible in 1917 and 1918 for saving millions of dollars worth of crops. It
is estimated that in 1918 it raised enough food to feed a million soldiers for one year.

EMPLOYMENT SERVICE IN PEACE TIME

With the passing of the war emergency, the elaborate machinery of the Employment Service was
in large measure allowed to fall to pieces through lack of appropriations for its maintenance.
This is true of much of the emergency organization of government developed during the war period.
It illustrates the tendency in our country to leave business control as fully as possible to
individual initiative excepting in times of great emergency. So important is the problem of
bringing the worker and the job together that many believe that the Employment Service organization
should be revived and continued.

The central office at Washington is still maintained. In most states there are still (1919)
state directors. The local machinery has been largely discontinued except in cities where volunteer
agencies, such as the Red Cross and other welfare organizations, have taken over the work,
chiefly to find employment for discharged soldiers and sailors. A few states have made appropriations
to continue the Boys' Working Reserve.

NATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE

One division of the Employment Service is the Junior Section, for the guidance of boys and
girls from 16 to 21 years of age seeking employment. Local junior sections were organized as
branches of local employment offices and in schools. A "junior counselor" was placed in charge
of each local junior section to study the needs and qualifications of those who applied for
employment, and to give them advice. The Junior Section is still maintained with a director
in the Washington office. The duties of the junior counselor are stated as follows:

To influence boys and girls to remain in school as long as possible.

To give aid toward the right start for those who have to leave school to go to work.

To arouse the ambitions of the boys and girls to fit themselves for definite careers.

To direct youth who are employed toward some form of trade, technical, or business school for
special training.

To promote the opportunities for vocational education.

To follow up all applicants in their training and at their work to see that they have the best
available advantages of study and labor.

GOVERNMENT ALWAYS AT OUR SERVICE

The array of facts contained in the foregoing paragraphs is given, not with the expectation
that those who read will memorize them, but to suggest the enormous amount of work that the
United States government is doing in the interest of agriculture and the farmer, and the extensive
machinery necessary to do it. The facts given are only a few of those that might be given.
The detailed story of how much of this work is done is fascinating, and often of thrilling
interest. All around us may be seen, if our eyes are open, the evidences of the work of our
government. Always the governmental machinery is at hand to serve us in a thousand ways, if
we are wise enough to use it. The more we study its work, the more we shall be impressed by
the fact that its greatest service is in opening the way for cooperation, and in providing
the organization and the leadership for such cooperation.

Topics for investigation:

How money serves as a means of cooperation.

How a bank serves as a means of cooperation.

CHAPTER XIII

THRIFT

"THRIFT IS GOOD MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS OF LIVING."

NATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF THRIFT

This definition is taken from "Ten Lessons in Thrift," issued by the Treasury Department of
the United States Government (February, 1919). The United States Government sent out these
lessons because "America to-day stands in the position in which all her economic problems must
be solved through thrift ... Unless our people gain a deep, sincere appreciation of the absolute
necessity for thrift, we cannot hope to hold the proud position we occupy as the flag bearer
of nations ..." [Footnote: S.W. Strauss, President American Society for Thrift, in "The Patriotism
of War Savings" (National Education Association pamphlet, THRIFT, 1918)]

LESSONS OF THE WAR

The great war taught us some lessons about the importance of thrift to the nation. The enormous
expenses of the war were paid and the armies and the civilian populations of the countries
at war were fed very largely by the combined small savings of our people. Nearly 20 million
people contributed to the fourth liberty loan, by which almost seven billion dollars were raised,
an average of about $350 for each contributor. Almost every one bought war savings stamps,
by which about a billion dollars were raised in 1918. Practically all this money came from
savings. Enormous sums were also given to the Red Cross and other causes. To do this people
saved and sacrificed "until it hurt." The provisioning of our armies and of the needy peoples
of Europe was made possible by the saving, in American homes, of slices of bread, of teaspoonfuls
of sugar, of small portions of meat and fats.

THRIFT AS PATRIOTISM

Thrift, however, is not merely a war necessity. "The time when thrift shall not be needed--needed
as vitally as food itself--will never come ... Through thrift alone can the rebuilding come--the
rebuilding of America--the rebuilding of the world ... Thrift is patriot ism because it is
the elimination of every element that tends to retard..." [Footnote: S W Strauss, "The Patriotism
of War Savings"]

Thrift is necessary both for individual success and for good citizenship. It is only by thrift
that the individual may in some measure repay others for the care he himself received during
dependent childhood, and provide, during his productive years, for the "rainy day" of sickness
and old age. It is by thrift that CAPITAL is accumulated with which to carry on the world's
work. The citizen who saves and invests his savings in a home, in business enterprises, in
bonds or savings stamps, not only makes his own future secure, but becomes identified with
the community and takes a greater interest in it. The thrifty citizen inspires the confidence
of the community, and acquires an influence in community affairs that the unthrifty citizen
does not enjoy. Finnish farmers in a certain section of New England are said to be able to
obtain credit from neighboring bankers and businessmen more easily than many of their neighbors,
and to be considered as especially desirable citizens, because of their reputation for thrift
and honesty. Thrift is often confused with stinginess and selfish ness. On the contrary it
alone makes generosity and service possible.

THRIFT, "THE ESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY"

"Thrift is the very essence of democracy." For democracy means freedom, equality of opportunity,
"self-determination." No man is a greater slave than one who is bound and driven by financial
necessity. By thrift the mind is "unfettered by the petty annoyances that result from improvident
ways." Thrift means providing for the future. There is nothing in the world that will so establish
one's faith in the future and that will, therefore, give that freedom of spirit upon which
democracy depends, as the wise use of to-day and of to-day's resources.

THRIFT A RIGHT AS WELL AS A DUTY

"Every man must practice thrift and every man must have the CHANCE of practicing it." It is
a RIGHT as well as a duty. Before the war it was said that four fifths of the wage earners
of our country received less than $750 a year for their labor. Studies in various cities also
showed that an average family of five could not maintain health and efficiency on an income
of less than from $750 to $1000. Under such circumstances thrift is the strictest necessity,
but it is a thrift that means pinching economy and the sacrifice of health and efficiency.
It is not the thrift that provides for the future and gives freedom to the individual, the
thrift that is "the essence of democracy itself." Every man should have an opportunity to earn
a "living wage," which includes an opportunity to provide for the future. Democracy is not
complete until that opportunity is afforded.

Thrift, or the good management of the business of living, is shown (1) in earning, (2) in spending,
(3) in saving, and (4) in investing.

THRIFT IN EARNING

(1) Since the earning of a living was the subject of Chapter XI, we need not dwell upon it
now except to note that a thrifty person is an industrious person--he makes wise use of his
time; and also to note that many of those who are now in want, or who, in advanced years, are
receiving small wages, owe their condition to a failure at some time or other to make use of
the opportunity for thrift. Many people do not recognize the opportunity when it is presented,
or lack the wisdom or the courage to seize it. Thrift involves MAKING A CHOICE, and in many
cases a wise choice requires courage as well as wisdom. It is a choice between the satisfaction
of present wants and the sacrifice of present enjoyment for the sake of greater satisfaction
and service in the future.

When a boy in school has a chance to take a job that will pay him wages, he has to make a choice
between it and remaining in school. It may seem to be the thrifty thing to go to work; but
real thrift is shown by careful choice of vocation, and by thorough preparation for it, even
though it requires sacrifices that seem difficult (see pp. 137, 139).

We may note here, also, that physical fitness is essential if earning power, which means power
to perform service, is to be fully developed. The "conservation" of health and life is so important
that a chapter is devoted to it later (Chapter XX).

THRIFT IN SPENDING

(2) After money has been earned, thrift shows itself first of all in the way the money is spent;
and many of us have the spending of the money that some one else has earned. Every time we
spend a nickel or a dollar we make a choice--we choose to spend or not to spend, how much we
shall spend, for what we shall spend.

A lawyer in a small town reports that in one month he made out the necessary papers to enable
75 men to mortgage their homes to buy automobiles.

Butchers say that during the war they more often sold expensive cuts of meat to wage earners
who were by no means well-to-do, but who happened for the time to be getting good wages, than
to people of larger means. One reason, perhaps, for extravagance in food and clothing on the
part of unintelligent people who find themselves unusually prosperous, is that they see no
better way to spend their money. Those who find pleasure in books, in education for their children,
in travel, in investing money in serviceable enterprises, and in the higher things of life,
have to make A CHOICE in regard to what they shall enjoy, and as a rule prefer to sacrifice
the grosser pleasures.

CHOOSING WHAT TO SPEND

People, and especially young people, need a certain amount of sweets in their diet. But when
we know that the candy bill of the people of the United States amounts to $400,000,000 a year,
that this is almost as much as the total amount spent for public education, that it is about
double the amount used to keep Belgium supplied with food for a year during the war, or that
it will buy 234 million bushels of corn at $1.70 a bushel, we may well think twice before deciding
to spend MUCH money for candy.

TESTS FOR SPENDING

The few cents difference in the price of two articles between which we must choose, and the
nickels we spend for immediate enjoyment, may seem to amount to very little; but the New York
City street railways collected in a year $95,000,000 in five-cent fares, and the Woolworth
Building in New York, one of the largest office buildings in the United States, was built from
the profits of "5 and 10 Cent Stores." One thrift stamp a week amounts in five years to $65,
and 14 cents a day at 4 per cent interest amounts in twenty years to more than $1500. In one
of the "Ten Lesson in Thrift," the following "tests in buying" are given:

Do I need it?

Do I need it now?

Do I need something else more?

Will it pay for itself in the end?

Do I help or injure the community in buying this?

Do you have instruction in your school in home economics that relates to wise spending or buying?

In what ways is thrift shown by having a class committee write one letter making the request
for the class instead of having each member of the class write?

Has any home demonstration work relating to thrift been conducted in your community? What methods
were employed, and what results achieved?

Who in your family makes most of the expenditures for the family living?

For what items in the family living is most of the money spent?

What are some of the things that have to be considered in buying food? clothing? house furnishings?
books? amusements?

Discuss the topics mentioned in the following statement of "values in buying" (from "Ten Lessons
in Thrift"):

Food: nutrition, healthfulness, cleanliness, attractiveness, flavor, quality, price, economy
in preparation (of time, strength, fuel, utensils), buying from bulk or in package, buying
in quantity or small unit, buying for the day or laying in stores, calculation of portions,
calculation of meals, varied diet.

Clothing: design related to material, color, and becomingness; style, durability; adaptability
to fine or rough wear, to repair and remaking; suitability to season, health, occupation, comfort;
home-made VERSUS ready-made; conditions of manufacture, use of child labor, the sweat shop,
the living wage, health.

Make a study at the grocery of the relative prices of articles bought in small and large quantities:
for example, laundry soap by the bar, by the quarter's worth, by the box; canned goods by the
can, by the dozen, and by the case; flour by the pound, by the 25- pound sack, 50-pound sack,
by the barrel; etc.

Make a study of the relative prices of articles in bulk and in package; for example, vinegar
by the bottle and by the gallon; bacon in bulk and in jars, etc.

Why may it be economy to buy some food articles in packages rather than in bulk, even at a
higher price? Give examples.

Which is likely to be more economical, to buy groceries by telephone or in person? To buy by
mail order or at the store in town? Why?

At Christmas time the Park View community center in Washington, D.C., ordered 140 turkeys from
a rural neighborhood center in Maryland. The turkeys were brought by the producers to the schoolhouse
of the rural neighborhood, taken by a postal service motor-truck to the schoolhouse of the
Park View center in Washington, and from there distributed to the 140 families. The city buyers
paid an average of 15 cents a pound less than the price prevailing in the Washington markets,
and the producers received 6 cents a pound more than the Washington markets were paying.

Why was there a saving to both producer and consumer in the above case? What costs of marketing
were cut out or reduced?

What is the "middleman"? Does he perform a real service to the community? Should he be paid
for his service? Why? Is it just that the middleman should be "eliminated" by cooperative marketing
and buying organizations? Why?

Is there any cooperative buying organization in your community? If so, how has it benefited
the community? If not, why? (Consult your parents, your county agent, and others.)

Get publications from your state agricultural college relating to cooperative buying and selling.

THRIFT IN MANAGEMENT

Wise expenditures depend not only upon knowledge of prices and qualities, but also upon good
management, as in planning ahead. One plan that has been the means of lifting many individuals
and families out of financial difficulties and of enabling them to lay by as savings a portion
of their income, however small the latter may be, is the BUDGET, which means the apportionment
of expenditures according to a plan laid out in advance. No budget can apply to all families
alike, but the following illustrates the principle:

House (rent, taxes, insurance, repairs)........................25%

Food (all expenditures for the table, ice, etc.)...............30%

Clothing (materials and making, repairing, cleaning, pressing, millinery, shoes)..............................................13%

Housekeeping (labor and materials for laundry, fuel and light, telephone, supplies, and furnishings)..........................12%

Educational (school and school books, club dues, church and charity contributions, gifts, books,
magazines, newspapers, amusements, medical and dental treatment)...................................6%

Luxuries (all items not necessaries and not coming under "educational," such as candies, etc.)...........................4%

Savings........................................................10%

Total.........................................................100%

Before a budget can be planned, and in order to know whether it is being lived up to, it is
necessary to keep accounts of receipts and expenditures. With such accounts, it is possible
to determine where savings can be made under some heads and where, perhaps, it is necessary
or advisable to spend more.

Is a budget used in your home? Find out from your parents their reason for using, or not using it.

Could you use a budget in your own personal affairs?

Find out whether a budget system is used by your local government and your state government
in apportioning expenditures.

How may we "budget" our time? Is the time you spend in school "budgeted"? Make a daily time
budget for yourself.

When is clothing a necessity and when a luxury? [Footnote: This and the following topics are
adapted from "Ten Lessons in Thrift."]

When is food a necessity and when an amusement?

When is amusement education and when a frivolity?

When is fuel an item in rent and when current housekeeping expense?

When are club dues education and when amusement?

When is vacation health and when amusement?

When is the theater amusement and when indulgence?

When is rent a necessity and when an extravagance?

[Footnote: From "Suggestion for Home Demonstration Agents regarding Methods of Teaching Thrift,"
States Relations Service Circular, Dec. 27, 1918.]

THRIFT IN SAVING

(3) The object of thrift in spending is both to get the greatest value for our money now and
to insure savings that will provide for the future. Every budget should make as definite provision
for savings as for rent or clothing. The purpose of a budget and of accounts is to assure a
surplus rather than a deficit. Successful men and women make it a practice always to spend
less than they earn, no matter how little they earn, and they cannot be sure of this without
planning ahead and keeping accounts. Saving in this way is largely a matter of habit; but it
is astonishing how many fail to form the habit. Court records show that out of every 100 men
who die, 82 leave no income-producing estates, or that about 85 per cent who reach the age
of 65 are dependent upon relatives or upon the community. "Out of every 100 widows, only 18
are left in comfortable circumstances, while 47 are obliged to go to work and 35 are left in
absolute want." [Footnote: S.W. Strauss, "The Greater Thrift," National Education Association
PROCEEDINGS, 1916, p. 278.]

AMERICAN EXTRAVAGANCE

Wise buying means saving money; and so does the wise use of what we buy. It is said that an
American ship can be distinguished from the ships of other nations in harbor by the flocks
of gulls that hover around to feast on the food thrown overboard. Whether this is true or not,
Americans have a reputation for wastefulness. It has been called our chief national sin. It
is said that a family in France can live in comfort on what an American family in the same
circumstances ordinarily throws away. An average load of garbage in New York City has been
shown to contain fifty dollars' worth of good food materials.

WHAT SMALL SAVINGS WILL DO

Investigations by the Food Administration showed that there is enough glycerine in a ton of
garbage to make explosives for 14 shells, enough fat and acid to make 75 bars of soap, and
enough fertilizer to grow 8 bushels of wheat. It is said that 24 cities wasted enough garbage
to make 4 million pounds of nitroglycerine, 40 million cakes of soap, and fertilizer for 3
million bushels of wheat. On the other hand, 300 cities produced 52 million pounds of pork
by feeding their garbage to hogs.

The Department of Agriculture has shown that the waste of a half- cup of milk daily by each
of the 20 million families in the United States would equal in a year the total production
of 400 thousand cows; that one ounce of meat or fat saved daily would in a year mean 875 thousand
steers, or a million hogs; and that if 81 percent of the whole wheat were used in bread instead
of 75 percent, the saving in a year would feed 12 million people. During the war our government
organized a campaign for the salvage of "junk," and the total amount collected had a value
of 1 1/2 billion dollars. The school children of Des Moines, Iowa, are reported to have gathered
and sold two thousand dollars' worth of waste paper in one week, and those of many other communities
obtained similar results.

VALUE OF BY-PRODUCTS

Every successful business man is constantly vigilant to discover and remedy waste in his business--waste
of materials, time, and effort. Many of the most valuable products in certain industries are
"by-products,"--that is, products produced as an incident to the main industry and from materials
that otherwise would have been wasted. In the manufacture of gas from coal, for example, important
by-products are coke, tar, and ammonia. There has been great waste in the lumber industry,
but now practically every scrap from the tree may be used. In the Forestry Products Laboratory
at the University of Wisconsin, a process has been discovered of producing from 15 to 25 gallons
of wood alcohol from a ton of sawdust--and sawdust has many other uses. These are only illustrations.
Scientists and inventors, many of them employed by the government, are constantly at work finding
uses for waste products.

WASTEFULNESS IN FARMING

Wastefulness is found in great variety in farming activities. For example:

Why plant seed only 60 or 70 per cent of which will germinate when, for a few dollars extra
and a little work, seed may be procured that will average 90 to 95 per cent in the germination
test? Why purchase or cultivate a worthless crab apple tree or a hybrid when Rome Beauty, Northern
Spy, or Grimes Golden, and other standard varieties of apples may be secured for a few additional
cents? Why feed and care for a "scrub" pig, calf, or colt when it will bring at maturity only
half or two thirds the price of a thoroughbred? ... It is not thrift to invest money in second-rate
products.

Some farmers are so careless ... that they do not husk their corn in the fall but leave it
standing in the field until late winter or early spring. By this time the fodder is somewhat
decayed and unfit for feeding purposes. Possibly a third of the corn has been eaten by the
birds, a third of it has rotted, and a third of it remains in a damp and moldy condition. ...
Many boys could make good wages by going over the corn field at cutting time and collecting
the ears lying on the ground. ... Often a farmer will cut down his hay, paying no attention
whatever to the reports of the weather bureau ... Apples shaken from the trees by the wind
decay on the ground ...

The bearings of mowing machines and reapers often suffer excessive wear because the owner neglects
to keep them properly oiled. Often a wheat drill, a mowing machine, a threshing machine, or
an engine is left out of doors for a whole year, or for several months after the farmer has
ceased to use it. A good piece of machinery, if judiciously used, properly lubricated, and
put away in a dry place, may last from ten to twenty years, while the life of such machinery
will only be about half as long without proper care. If a wooden handle rots loose from its
fastenings it is an indication that the handle has not been thoroughly dried after it has been
used. Tools rust out very readily if they are not kept dry and thoroughly oiled ... So careless
are some farmers that hoes, shovels, mattocks, wrenches, saws, and axes are thrown down in
the field or woods to lie there until it is again necessary to use them. It often takes hours
to find an article thus misplaced or thrown aside. It is economy of time to know just where
to find everything on the farm. [Footnote: The Teaching of Thrift, by H. R. Bonner, Assistant
State Superintendent of Schools, West Virginia, pp. 22, 23.]

THRIFT IN INVESTMENT

(4) Thrift involves a wise use of savings. They may be invested in a home, a wise use because
of the satisfaction that a home produces. If the home is well located, well built, and well
kept up, it will probably also increase in money value. Savings may be invested in machinery
for farming, manufacturing, or mining; in a stock of goods to be sold at a profit; in houses
or office buildings to be rented to others; or they may be lent to others who pay interest
for their use. In all these cases money represents CAPITAL--capital being the machinery or
tools and other equipment with which wealth is produced.

Capital is brought into existence in only one way--that is, by consuming less than is produced.
If one has a dollar one can spend it either for an article of consumption, say confectionery,
or for an article of production, say a spade. He who buys a spade becomes a capitalist to the
amount of a dollar--that is, he becomes the owner of tools. The process is precisely the same
whether the amount in question is a dollar or a million dollars. [Footnote: T.N. Carver, "How
to Use Farm Credit," FARMERS' BULLETIN 593, U.S. Department of Agriculture, p. 2.]

BORROWING

Every business requires capital, some more than others. Farming requires more capital to-day
than formerly because of the increased use of machinery. The necessary capital must either
be saved by the person who wants to use it, or borrowed from others who have saved it.

The advantage of borrowing is that one does not have to wait so long to get possession of the
tools and equipment. One can get them at once and make them produce the means of paying for
themselves. Without them the farmer's production might be so low as to make it difficult ever
to accumulate enough with which to buy them. With their help he may be able to pay for them--that
is, to pay off the debt--in a shorter time than it would take to accumulate the purchase price
without them. That is the only advantage of credit in any business, but it is a great advantage
to those who know how to use it. This confidence depends on his reputation for honesty and
his known ability to repay. A man, as a rule, has to HAVE something--land or property of other
kind-- that he can offer as security before he can borrow much. It is for this reason that
thrift is essential to a man's credit--thrift and honesty.

There is no magic about credit. It is a powerful agency for good in the hands of those who
know how to use it. So is a buzz saw. They are about equally dangerous in the hands of those
who do not understand them. ... Many a farmer would be better off to-day if he had never had
a chance to borrow money at all, or go into debt for the things which he bought. However, there
is no reason why those farmers who do know how to use credit should not have it.

Shortsighted people, however, who do not realize how inexorably the time of payment arrives,
who do not know how rapidly tools wear out and have to be replaced, or do not keep accounts
in order that they may tell exactly where they stand financially, will do well to avoid borrowing.
Debts have to be paid with deadly certainty, and they who do not have the wherewithal when
the day of reckoning arrives become bankrupt with equal certainty.

On the other hand there is nothing disgraceful in borrowing for productive purposes. The feeling
that it is not quite respectable to go into debt has grown out of the old habit of borrowing
to pay living expenses. That was regarded, perhaps rightly, as a sign of incompetency. ...
But to borrow for a genuinely productive purpose, for a purpose that will bring you in more
than enough to pay off your debt, principal and interest, is a profitable enterprise. It shows
business sagacity and courage, and is not a thing to be ashamed of. But it cannot be too much
emphasized that the would-be borrower must calculate very carefully and be sure that it is
a productive enterprise before he goes into debt. [Footnote: T. N. Carver, "How to Use Farm
Credit," p. 2.]

COOPERATION FOR CREDIT

Even though a farmer be thrifty, industrious, and honest, the conditions of farm business are
such that it has not always been easy for him to borrow capital. Here again cooperation helps.
In some of our states the law permits the organization of CREDIT UNIONS. The members are farmers
of a neighborhood or district and, therefore, are acquainted with one another. Each member
must buy shares of stock, which provides a certain amount of funds. The union may also receive
deposits of money, paying interest on them as a savings bank would do. This increases the funds
and also encourages thrift on the part of the farmer. Idle money, or money that might otherwise
be spent unwisely, is thus made productive. In some unions, as in Massachusetts, children are
encouraged to deposit their small savings, and in some cases half the capital of the union
is made up of such small savings deposits. From these funds loans are made to members of the
union on reasonable terms, provided they are to be used for productive purposes. The union
may also borrow money from the bank in town on the COLLECTIVE CREDIT of its members for the
improvement of agricultural conditions in the neighborhood.

NATIONAL AID TO THE FARMERS' CREDIT

Similar aid to the farmers' credit has been given by the national government through the Federal
Farm Loan Act of 1916. This Act created a Federal Farm Loan Board in the Treasury Department,
and twelve Federal Land Banks, one in each of twelve districts into which the United States
was divided for that purpose. Through the organization provided by the board and the banks,
a farmer may now borrow money on more favorable terms, but only on condition that he agrees
to use the money for the purchase and improvement of land or for equipment, and to engage in
the actual cultivation of the farm for the development of which he desired the money.

The provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act afford an excellent illustration of how government
promotes citizen cooperation. The government does not lend the money to the farmers; it merely
provides the machinery by which the farmers may cooperate among themselves, and also secure
the cooperation of investors in all parts of the country, to obtain capital necessary for the
proper development of the land. As a rule the farmer can borrow money from the land bank only
by being a member of a local "national farm loan association." His dealings with the bank are
through this association. His membership in the association gives him better standing and secures
for him better terms than he could get if acting separately. Moreover, the money that the bank
lends to the farmer comes from the farmers who belong to the association, and from investors
in all parts of the country, who buy shares of stock in the bank and bonds issued by the bank
on the security of the farmers' land and equipment. The whole scheme is one of cooperation
which would be impossible but for the legislation, financial support, and supervision of the
government at Washington.

PARTNERSHIP IN THE NATION'S BUSINESS

It will be seen then that much of the capital that a farmer uses is borrowed, and is made up
of small savings of other people--some of them his neighbors, others in distant places. The
same is true with respect to the capital used in all other businesses. The enormous capital
of railroads is derived chiefly from the savings of millions of people, some of whom buy shares
of railroad stock directly, but most of whom deposit their savings in banks or other institutions
which, in turn, lend it to the railroads or invest it in their stock. The farmer or the school
boy who has a savings account in a neighboring bank thus may become a partner in various business
enterprises of the country. His dollars or dimes, added to the dollars and dimes of many other
people, are used to buy machinery and tools and materials, and to pay labor. Because of the
service performed by his savings he receives interest on his money.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT

There are many opportunities for young people to invest savings in productive enterprises,--perhaps
more in rural communities than elsewhere. The different kinds of boys' and girls' clubs illustrate
the variety of channels through which money may be both earned and invested. As soon as a boy
invests a little money in a pig, or a calf, or garden tools, he becomes a capitalist to that
extent. It is to be hoped that not many have the experience of the boy described in the following
lines: [Footnote: Read by R.H. Wilson, in an address before the National Council of Education,
N.E.A. PROCEEDINGS, 1917, p. 133.]

    Johnnie bought a little pig with money he had earned,
    He named her Nell and fed her well, and lots of tricks she learned.
    But Nellie grew to be a sow, had piggies quite a few,
    Then father up and sold them, and kept the money, too.

    Johnnie took a little calf as pay for hoeing corn,
    He loved the calf and the calf loved him as sure as you are born.
    The calfie grew to be a cow, as all good calfies do,
    Then father up and sold her, and kept the money, too.

    Now, Johnnie loved his little pets, but father loved the pelf,
    So Johnnie left his father's farm and struck out for himself.
    Said Johnnie's pa, one summer day, "I often wonder why
    Boys don't like life upon the farm, 'the city' is their cry."

    "It always will be strange to me," continued Johnnie's pa,
    "It only goes to prove, though, how ungrateful children are."
    When Johnnie heard what father said, he gave a bitter laugh,
    And thought of his empty childhood and of his pig and calf.

Savings may be deposited in savings banks, which accept small deposits and pay compound interest,
usually at a rate of 3 per cent or 3 1/2 per cent. Such banks operate in accordance with state
or national laws to protect the depositor against loss. Many schools conduct school savings
banks. The pupils bring their small amounts to the teacher or to some pupil acting as "teller,"
the collected funds then being deposited in some bank in the community. These school banks
promote habits of thrift and afford experience in business methods, besides bringing into use
in the world's work many small amounts of money that would otherwise be lying idle or spent
unwisely.

POSTAL SAVINGS SYSTEM

In 1910 Congress established the Postal Savings System under which any post office may be a
savings bank. Any person over ten years of age may deposit money at the postal savings bank
in amounts of from $1.00 to $25.00, receiving from the postmaster POSTAL SAVINGS CERTIFICATES
as evidence of the deposit. Provision is made for savings accounts of less than a dollar by
selling POSTAL SAVINGS STAMPS at ten cents each, ten of which may be exchanged for a dollar
certificate. Two per cent interest is paid on postal savings, but savings certificates may
be exchanged for POSTAL SAVINGS BONDS, bearing interest at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent.

LENDING TO THE GOVERNMENT

The purchase of Liberty Bonds or Savings Stamps and Thrift Stamps is a good investment and
a patriotic act. The money raised in this way is used for the national defense and for reconstruction
after the war. The Savings Division of the United States Treasury Department carries on a campaign
of thrift education. Among other things, it promotes the organization of savings societies
and thrift clubs, because thrift is a habit which is encouraged by the example and cooperation
of others. In Randolph County, Indiana, for example, each consolidated school has its thrift
club, and over 75 per cent of the pupils are members. One of these schools sold over $11,000
worth of thrift stamps, and others sold from $1500 to $3500 worth. Savings societies exist
among the workmen of many industries, and employers report that these have increased the purchase
of homes, and have resulted in a saving of materials and tools because of the habits of thrift
established.

INSURANCE

Among the many other agencies to promote thrift we shall only mention BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS
and INSURANCE. The purpose of building and loan associations is to help people of small means
to purchase or build homes. Insurance affords a particularly good illustration of organized
cooperation. The PREMIUMS paid by thousands of policy holders produce a large sum of money,
part of which goes to pay the expenses of the insurance company, but most of which is invested
in enterprises that cause the amount rapidly to increase. Out of this fund the occasional losses
of individuals are paid. Life insurance is a good form of investment. It provides for the future
of the family of the insured in case of his death. By the ENDOWMENT plan the insured may himself
receive, at the end of a specified number of years, all that he has paid in premiums together
with interest.

During the war our national government itself insured the soldiers against death or injury.
This was known as WAR RISK INSURANCE. At the end of the war the soldier had the privilege of
converting the war risk insurance into a regular form of insurance, still provided, however,
by the government itself. One of our states also, Wisconsin, sells life insurance to its citizens.

As we proceed with our study we shall encounter other aspects of thrift in various chapters.
As a nation we may be thrifty or unthrifty in the use of our resources (see Chapters XIV and
XV). Thrift is as essential in our "community housekeeping," which is carried on by government,
as in our homes and business. But we can hardly expect thrift to become a national characteristic
unless it first becomes a personal habit.

Are you a capitalist? If so, explain in what way.

What forms does the capital take with which your father does business?

What capital does an Eskimo have? the American Indians when the country was first settled?

Do you belong to a thrift club? Would it be desirable to organize one in your school? Confer
with your teacher and principal about it. Write to the Savings Division, U.S. Treasury Department,
Washington, D.C., for literature regarding organization.

Is there a credit union, or a savings association, or other organization to promote thrift
in your community? If so, find out how it operates.

Write a story on the subject, "What my five dollars may accomplish after I put it in the savings
bank, before it comes back to me with interest."

Why are people willing to accept a lower rate of interest from a postal savings bank than from
an ordinary savings bank?

CHAPTER XIV

THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE LAND

"NATURE WAS MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN MAN. SHE WOULD SUFFER NO SUDDEN HIGHWAYS TO BE THROWN
ACROSS HER SPACES; SHE ABATED NOT AN INCH OF HER MOUNTAINS, COMPROMISED NOT A FOOT OF HER FORESTS.
... FOR THE CREATION OF THE NATION THE CONQUEST OF HER PROPER TERRITORY FROM NATURE WAS FIRST
NECESSARY ... A BOLD RACE HAS DERIVED INSPIRATION FROM THE SIZE, THE DIFFICULTY, THE DANGER
OF THE TASK."

If you wanted to buy a farm, what facts would you investigate in regard to land and location?

What farm in your neighborhood comes nearest to meeting your requirements in these matters?
Explain fully why.

Make a sketch map of a farm in your neighborhood, preferably one upon which you have lived,
showing as nearly as you can the boundaries, the position of highlands and lowlands, marshes,
timber, streams, etc. Also the position of house, barns, bridges, roads, and other important
features.

Did the features of the land indicated on your map determine the location of the buildings?
of the roads and bridges? the kinds of crops raised on different parts of the farm?

Should the surface features of the land be taken into account in determining the position of
the house and barns in relation to each other? Why?

Has the character of the land influenced the life of the farmer's family in any way? Explain.

IMPORTANCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS

Directly or indirectly, geographical conditions affect every aspect of community life and help
or hinder us in satisfying all of our wants (see Chapter I). Their influence is chiefly felt,
however, in their relation to the economic interest of the people; that is, in relation to
earning a living and the production of wealth.

ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE LAND

Every step that man has taken to make his relations with the land permanent and definite has
been a step of progress in civilization, as when, for example, the savage hunter became a herdsman,
or the herdsman an agriculturist. We live to-day in an age of machinery, which is a result
of turning to our use the metals from the depths of the earth and the power derived from the
forces of nature, as in the application of steam, electricity, and the explosive force of gasoline.
Many have had a part in this work of establishing relations with the land: explorers; scientists
who have discovered the uses of our varied mineral and vegetable resources and how to make
the forces of nature serve us; engineers who have built our railroads and bridges and tunneled
our mountains. A most important part has been taken by those who win their living directly
from nature's resources--the woodsman, the miner, the farmer; and the service of the farmer
has been especially great in giving stability to our community life.

AGRICULTURE MEANS A SETTLED LIFE

Those American Indians were most civilized who had developed agriculture to the highest point,
because this meant a settled life. If we recall the story of the colonization of America we
shall remember that it was not successfully accomplished by the gold hunters and fur traders
who came first, but only when those came who, as farmers, began to cultivate the soil. Later,
as the population moved westward across the Alleghenies into the Mississippi Valley and on
to the Pacific Coast, the hunters and trappers were the scouts who found the way, while the
real army that took possession of the land was an army of farmers.

Did the American Indians who formerly lived in your locality lead a settled life? Why? Were
they agriculturists to any extent? If so, what do you know of their method of agriculture?

Of what pastoral peoples have you read? Why was their life more settled than that of hunting
peoples? Why less settled than that of farmers?

Why were settlements by gold hunters and fur traders likely not to be permanent?

Do you know of important mining towns that have had a brief life?

PROTECTING OWNERSHIP OF LAND

The story of how individuals acquired the right to own land is an interesting one, but too
long to be told here. The right has long been recognized and protected by government. If your
father owns a piece of land he doubtless has a DEED for it, containing an accurate description
of the land and giving him title to ownership. In each county there is an office of government
where all deeds are recorded--the office of the recorder or register of deeds.

The record of every piece of land is thus kept and is open to examination by any one. If a
man wishes to buy a piece of land he will go to the office of the recorder and find out whether
the title to the land is clear. Only by so doing may he be protected against error or fraud.

TRANSFERS OF LAND

Since lands are likely to change hands a number of times, and since men frequently MORTGAGE
their lands as security for loans or other indebtedness, thus giving to others a claim to their
land, it is sometimes a tedious and difficult task for a buyer to trace the record back and
to be sure that the title to the land is clear. It sometimes requires months. There are lawyers
who make a business of examining the records and making ABSTRACTS OF TITLES. This involves
expense. Besides, there is always the chance that a mistake may be made somewhere. For this
reason some states have adopted a plan known as the TORRENS SYSTEM of land transfer, from the
name of the man who devised it in Australia.

Under the Torrens System the government itself, through its proper officer, may examine the
title to any piece of land. The land is then REGISTERED, and the owner is given a certificate
as evidence. If a mortgage is placed on the land or if it changes hands the transaction is
recorded on the certificate and in the office records. A mere glance at the record of registry
or at the certificate is sufficient to ascertain the title to the land. Thus time and expense
are saved; and moreover the government gives its absolute guarantee to the owner or buyer as
to his rights in the land.

The Torrens System is in use in some form in fourteen states of the Union, in the Philippines
and Hawaii, and in various other countries of the world.

THE SURVEY OF THE PUBLIC LANDS

When settlers began to occupy the lands west of the Alleghenies, many of them laid claim to
tracts without much regard for the claims of others. Boundary lines were indefinite. Where
surveys were made they were often inaccurate. Much confusion resulted. Disputes arose that
frequently found their way into the courts and dragged on for many years. The government sought
to put an end to this state of affairs, and in Thomas Jefferson's administration a survey was
begun to establish lines by which any piece of land might be located and defined with exactness.

The government survey was begun by establishing certain north and south lines known as PRINCIPAL
MERIDIANS. There are twenty-four of these, the first being the meridian that separates Indiana
from Ohio, while the last runs through the state of Oregon. At intervals of six miles east
and west of the principal meridians were established other meridians called RANGE LINES. A
parallel of latitude was then chosen as a BASE LINE, and at intervals of six miles north and
south of the base line were established TOWNSHIP LINES. These township lines with the range
lines divide the country into areas six miles square called TOWNSHIPS. A township may thus
be located with reference to its nearest base line and principal meridian (see diagram I).

Since meridians converge as we go north (look at a globe), the townships are not exactly square,
and become slightly smaller toward the north. To correct this, certain parallels north and
south of the base line were chosen as CORRECTION LINES, from which the survey began again as
from the original base line.

Each township is divided into SECTIONS one mile square, and therefore containing 640 acres
each. These sections are numbered in each township from 1 to 36 as indicated in diagram III.
Each section is further subdivided into halves and quarters, which are designated as in diagram IV.

This government survey has been made only in the "public lands" (see below, p. 197). It is
still being carried on by the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior. In 1917
more than 10,000,000 acres, or nearly 16,000 square miles, were surveyed. In that year there
still remained unsurveyed more than 900,000 square miles of public land, 590,000 of which were
in Alaska and 320,000 in the United States proper. In the original thirteen states along the
Atlantic seaboard a similar survey has been made, but either by private enterprise or under
the authority of the state or county governments. Massachusetts has recently spent a large
sum of money in a new survey of the state for the purpose of verifying and correcting doubtful
boundaries.

Has your father a deed to the land you live on? If so, ask him to show it to you and explain
it. How is the land described?

At the first convenient time, make a visit to the office of the recorder of deeds in your county,
and ask to have some of the records shown and explained to you, preferably the record of the
property you occupy. Where is the office of the recorder? (A visit of this sort should be in
company with the teacher or parent. A class excursion for this and other purposes may well
be arranged for.)

What is a MORTGAGE? An ABSTRACT OF TITLE? (Consult parents.)

Is the Torrens System in use in your state?

Is your state a "public land state"?

machinery of government exists to settle such disputes?

THE PUBLIC LANDS

At the close of the Revolutionary War, the territory of the United States extended west as
far as the Mississippi River. That part of this territory which lay west of the Allegheny Mountains
had been claimed by seven of the thirteen states that formed the Union; but soon after the
war they ceded these western possessions to the United States, having received a promise from
Congress that these lands, which were largely unoccupied at the time, should be disposed of
"FOR THE COMMON BENEFIT OF THE UNITED STATES." They thus became PUBLIC LANDS; that is, they
belonged to the people of the nation as a whole. The common interest in these public lands
was one of the chief influences that kept the thirteen states united under one government during
the troubled times between the close of the Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution
in 1789. As time went on, the public lands of the nation were increased by the acquisition
of new territory, [Footnote: Louisiana Territory was acquired in 1803, Oregon in 1805, Florida
in 1812 and 1819, Texas in 1845, California and New Mexico in 1846-48, the Gadsden Purchase
in 1853, Alaska in 1867.] Of the 3,600,000 square miles comprising the United States and Alaska
more than three fourths has at some time been public land; but of this there now remain, exclusive
of Alaska, only about 360,000 square miles, much of which is forest and mineral land, unsuitable
for agriculture.

DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLIC LANDS

To turn this great domain with all its resources to the fullest service of the nation has been
one of the greatest problems with which our government has had to deal. In the early part of
our history various plans were tried by which to secure the occupancy and development of the
agricultural lands by farmers, until in 1862 the first Homestead Act was passed by Congress.

About 10,000,000 acres of the public land were given to soldiers who fought in the Revolution
and in the War of 1812 in recognition of then-service to their country. About 60,000,000 acres
were later given to veterans of the Mexican War.

Until the year 1800 the plan in use for the disposition of the public lands was to sell large
areas to colonizing companies, with the expectation that these companies would find settlers
to whom they would sell the land in small quantities at a profit. This was not successful,
as actual settlers found it difficult to get land they wanted at prices they could afford.

From 1800 to 1820 lands were sold in small areas ON CREDIT. Many bought more than they were
able to pay for, and much land so disposed of had to be taken back by the government.

In 1820 a third plan was adopted: That of selling land for cash in any quantity to any purchaser.
This led to speculation, individuals and companies of individuals buying recklessly, without
intention of actual settlement, but with the purpose of selling again at a profit. This brought
on a financial panic in 1837.

Then followed the "PREEMPTION" plan, by which actual settlers could "preempt" land (get the
first right to it) by merely taking possession and paying a cash price of $1.25 an acre.

The Homestead Act of 1862 was an extension of the preemption plan; but instead of paying a
cash price, the settler could acquire the land merely by living on it for a period of five
years (now three) and paying fees of about $40.00.

HOMESTEAD ACTS

The Homestead Act, like earlier laws, made a direct appeal to men's desire to earn a living,
to acquire property, and especially to own homes. It has been modified from time to time, but
in all essentials it still remains in force and provides that any citizen of the United States
who has reached the age of twenty-one, or who is the head of a family, may acquire a farm on
condition of living upon it for a period of three years, cultivating the land and erecting
a dwelling, and paying to the government a small fee. The size of the farm that he may so acquire
varies according to the nature of the land, but the usual homestead on good agricultural land
is limited to 160 acres.

The purpose of the government has been to encourage ACTUAL SETTLEMENT in order to secure the
development of the nation's resources, and for this purpose to allow each settler enough land
to enable him to support a family in comfort. It was decided that 160 acres of GOOD FARM LAND
was enough.

Some portions of the public land, however, are less productive than others. Where the rainfall
is slight and where irrigation is impracticable, and yet where crops can be raised by the "dry
farming" process, the law allows a settler to take 320 acres.

A settler may also obtain 320 acres in the "desert lands" of some of the western states. These
lands may be made productive by irrigation, but the settler must construct his own irrigation
system. Originally 640 acres were allowed in such lands, but the amount has been reduced to
320 acres, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office now recommends (1916) that it be
further reduced to 160 acres.

In those parts of the desert region which the government has already reclaimed by irrigation,
thus making the land extremely fruitful, the amount usually allowed a settler is from 40 to
80 acres.

There are regions where the land is suitable only for stock raising and for forage crops. Here
Congress has decided that 640 acres is a fair amount for the support of a family.

Lands that are valuable for their timber and mineral resources are disposed of on different
terms, but on somewhat the same principle.

RECLAMATION OF LANDS BY SOLDIERS

At the close of the war in 1918 a plan was proposed by the Secretary of the Interior to secure
the occupation of land by returning soldiers. Since the lands suitable for farming in their
natural state have practically all been disposed of; the plan contemplates the reclamation
of arid and swamp lands, and of land from which the forests have been cut but which are still
covered with stumps. It is proposed that returned soldiers shall be employed by the government
in the work of reclaiming the land, and that those who desire to become farmers may buy their
farms in the reclaimed lands at a reasonable price, and with a period of thirty or forty years
in which to pay for them. The Secretary of the Interior said: "This plan does not contemplate
anything like charity to the soldier ... He is not to be made to feel that he is a dependent.
On the contrary, he is to continue in a sense in the service of the Government. Instead of
destroying our enemies he is to develop our resources." Much of the land whose reclamation
by and for returning soldiers is thus contemplated is not now public land, but is lying idle
in the hands of private owners.

LAND SETTLEMENT IN CALIFORNIA

The state of California has recently enacted a law known as the Land Settlement Act, which
provides for "a demonstration in planned rural development." "Its first idea is educational,
to show what democracy in action can accomplish." Under the terms of this act the state acting
through a Land Settlement Board and with the cooperation of experts from the University of
California, has purchased several thousand acres of land at Durham, in Butte County, which
it sells to settlers on easy terms. It also lends money to settlers for improvement and equipment
for the farmers.

The California Land Settlement Act is significant, because it eliminates speculation, it aims
to create fixed communities by anticipating and providing those things essential to early and
enduring success.

Another feature is the use it makes of cooperation. The settlers are at the outset brought
into close business and social relations. It reproduces the best feature of the New England
town meeting, as every member of the community has a share in the discussions and planning
for the general welfare. This influence in rural life has been lacking in new communities in
recent years. In the great movement of people westward with its profligate disposal of public
land, settlement became migratory and speculative. Every man was expected to look out for himself.
Rural neighborhoods became separated into social and economic strata. There was the nonresident
landowner; the influential resident landowner; the tenant, aloof and indifferent to community
improvements; and, below that, the farm laborer who had no social status and who in recent
years, because of lack of opportunity and social recognition, has migrated into the cities
where he could have independence and self-respect, or has degenerated into a hobo.

 At Durham, for the first time in American land settlement, the
farm laborer who works for wages is recognized as having as useful
and valuable a part in rural economy as the farm owner. The
provisions made for his home are intended to give to his wife and
children comfort, independence, and self-respect; in other words,
the things that help create character and sustain patriotism. The
farm laborers' homes already built are one of the most attractive
features of the settlement; and when the community members gather
together, as they do, to discuss matters that affect the progress
of the settlement, or to arrange for cooperative buying and
selling, the farm laborer and his family are active and respected
members of the meetings.

THE NATION'S INTERESTS ARE FIRST

The policy of the government of disposing of the public lands to individuals has of course
been of great benefit to the latter; but we should not lose sight of the fact that the national
well-being is the first consideration. As the Commissioner of the General Land Office said
in a recent report (1916), "Every acre of public land disposed of under this line of legislation
is AN INVESTMENT, the profits to be found in the general development of the welfare of the
nation at large."

SAFEGUARDING THE INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUALS

It has been no simple matter to administer our public lands, and mistakes have been made. Sometimes
the interests of individuals have not been sufficiently safeguarded. Many settlers have suffered
serious loss, and many promising communities have failed, through the taking of homesteads
in regions of little rainfall, as in western Kansas and Nebraska. The government now seeks
to protect homesteaders against such errors by distinguishing carefully between lands suitable
for ordinary agriculture and those suitable only for dry-farming and stock-raising, by informing
prospective settlers in regard to the facts, and by allowing larger entries in lands of the
latter classes. Another mistake was made in allowing many of the first claimants to stock-
raising lands so to locate their claims as to acquire the exclusive use of the only available
water supply for miles around, thus making useless other large tracts. This might have been
avoided by a little foresight.

ABUSE OF LAND LAWS

On the other hand, the land laws have sometimes been abused. Large quantities of public land
have fallen into the hands of speculators whose purpose is not to develop its resources, but
to make a profit from the increased value of the land due to the efforts of others. Immense
areas of land have thus been withheld from production, or have been made to produce to a limited
extent only, to the great loss of the nation.

RAILROAD LANDS

In the days of transcontinental railroad building, large tracts of land were given to the railroad
companies by the government, with the expectation that they would dispose of it at reasonable
prices to settlers attracted by the new transportation facilities, and would use the proceeds
in railway development. In fact, however, large quantities of this land have been held in an
unproductive state for speculative purposes.

An illustration of this is the case of the Oregon and California Railroad land grant, made
by Congress in 1869 and 1870, and comprising more than 4,200,000 acres, most of which bore
a heavy growth of valuable timber. "This railroad grant ... contained a special provision to
the effect that the railroad company should sell the land it received to actual settlers only,
in quantities not greater than one-quarter section to one purchaser and at a price not exceeding
$2.50 an acre. By this precaution it was intended that in aiding the construction of the railroad
an immediate impetus should also be given to the settlement and development of the country
through which the road was to be constructed."

After selling some of the lands according to the terms of the agreement, the railroad company
ceased to live up to these terms and sold large bodies of the land to lumber interests, thus
putting a stop to the development of the region in the way intended by the government. The
government brought action against the railroad company, the outcome of which is that the government
has bought back from the company at $2.50 an acre all of the lands of the grant which remained
unsold, amounting to about 2,300,000 acres and valued at from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000.

These lands are being classified "in accordance with their chief value, either in power-site
lands, timber lands, or agricultural lands," and are to be disposed of accordingly. The timber
will be sold separately from the land, and the land will then be opened to homestead entry.

By this arrangement the railroad company gets for the land all that it was entitled to under
the terms of the original grant. In addition, provision is made for the payment to the counties
in which the land lies of the taxes which the railroad company has not paid. As the lands are
sold, the proceeds are to be divided between the state and the United States, the state receiving
50 percent, 40 percent being paid into the general reclamation fund of the United States (see
Chapter XIV, p. 213), and 10 per cent into the general funds of the United States Treasury.

(From the Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, 1916, pp. 46-49).

This is a striking illustration of how our government, acting through Congress, the Courts,
and the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior, has sought to obtain justice
for all parties concerned, and to fulfill the original purpose of securing the development
of the land in the interest of the state and the nation.

LANDS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Something like 133,000,000 acres of our public lands have from time to time been turned over
to the states, the proceeds to be used for the promotion of public education, for the construction
of roads, and for other purposes (see Chapters XVII and XIX). In some cases these lands have
not been used altogether for the purposes for which they were granted. School lands have sometimes
been sold at a nominal price to individuals who have reaped the profit, whereas the lands might
have been so administered by the states as to have brought large returns for educational purposes.
In some cases, state officials have made unwise investments of the funds derived from the sale
of the lands, thereby losing them for the use of the state.

LAND MONOPOLY AND TENANTRY

The control, or "monopolizing," of the public land by large holders is said to be one of the
causes of increasing tenantry (Chapter X, p. 116); for as the available supply of desirable
farming land is diminished, the actual home-seeker is driven to take less productive lands,
or to purchase from the large holders at a higher price. The more recent land laws limit the
amount of public land that an individual may acquire to an area sufficient to enable him to
make a comfortable living for a family (see above, p. 199). They also exact from the homesteader
an agreement that he will actually occupy and cultivate the land.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAND FRAUDS

The responsibility for the defects in our methods of administering the public lands rests in
part upon our governmental representatives, who have not always dealt wisely with the extremely
difficult problem. But it rests also upon each individual citizen. There are those, be it said
to our shame, who deliberately seek to defeat the purpose of the laws and to appropriate to
their own selfish uses the lands which belong to the nation as a whole. There is one division
of the General Land Office in Washington known as the Contest Division. Before it come, not
only the ordinary disputes that are likely to arise between rival claimants, but also cases
of alleged fraud and violation of the land laws. In the year 1916 MORE THAN 12,000 CASES OF
ALLEGED FRAUD WERE ACTED UPON, AND NEARLY 12,000 OTHER CASES AWAITED ACTION AT THE END OF THE
YEAR! But the responsibility comes much closer home than this. Many of us who would not think
of violating the law have failed to appreciate the value of the gifts that nature has given
us, and have apparently been "too busy" to inform ourselves as to whether or not our public
lands have been administered solely for the purpose to which Congress devoted them just after
the Revolution. This, like every other matter of community interest, requires team work.

The community has certain rights to a citizen's land that are clearly recognized as superior
to the citizen's rights. Acting through its government, it may take a part of a citizen's property
by taxation (see Chapter XXIII). Taxes are paid in money; but if a citizen does not pay the
tax upon his land, the government may sell the land for enough to cover the obligation.

THE RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN

Again, the government may take a citizen's land for public uses, if the interests of the community
demand it, by what is called the RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN. For example, if the interests of
the community demand that a new road be built, the government will seek to buy the necessary
land from the farmers along the line of the proposed highway. Some farmer may say that he does
not want the road to run through his farm, or he may try to get a price beyond what his land
is worth. The government may then CONDEMN the required land and fix a price despite the farmer's
objections. The citizen whose land is taken must, however, be paid for it; the Constitution
of the United States protects him by the provision, "nor shall private property be taken for
public use without just compensation" (Amendment V, last clause).

The right of eminent domain may be exercised to secure a site for a schoolhouse, a post-office,
an army post, or courthouse, or for any other public purpose. The government also authorizes
corporations that perform a public service to exercise the right, as in the case of railroads
which must obtain a right of way for their tracks, and sites for their yards and stations.

THE POLICE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT

Finally, by the exercise of what is known as the POLICE POWER, the government may control the
use to which a citizen may put his land. Occasion for the exercise of the police power arises
most frequently in cities, where it is necessary to control the construction of buildings for
fire protection, and to regulate the kinds of business that may be conducted. In country districts
it does not usually make so much difference what a man does on his own land; but even there
the police power may be exercised, as when the state of Idaho passed a law forbidding the herding
of sheep within a certain distance of towns.

POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH THE LAND

There is another way in which government establishes relations between the people and the land.
Citizens of the United States have certain political rights and duties, such as voting, holding
office, and paying taxes. These rights may be enjoyed and the duties performed only within
certain districts which the government creates for this purpose. Thus, a citizen has a right
to vote within the state where he lives, but not in any other state. He must cast his vote
within his own county, township, and precinct. The boundaries of the states are established
by the national government (except the original thirteen states of the Union, whose boundaries
were fixed before the national government was organized); but they may not be changed afterward
without the consent of the states affected. The states organize their own counties and townships
[Footnote: In the public land states the political township usually, but not always, corresponds
with the township surveyed by the national government. See pp. 194-196.] and other districts.
Villages and cities are granted definite boundaries by the state, and organize themselves into
wards and precincts. There are legislative, congressional, judicial, and revenue districts,
the boundaries of which are fixed by state and national governments. Locally, there are school
districts. The boundaries which separate one nation from another are determined by agreement,
or treaty, between the nations concerned. Uncertainty or indefiniteness in regard to national
boundary lines has been the cause of much international strife, and was an important factor
in the European war begun by Germany in 1914.

If you live in a "public land" state, for what uses have public lands been given to the state?
Have the school lands in your state been wisely used?

Is it easy for a young man to acquire a farm in your locality? to keep up improvements on a
farm that he owns? Has it been easy for a farmer in your locality to borrow money? (Consult
parents and friends.)

Have the farmers of your locality made much use of the Federal Farm Loan Act? Do they think
it is a good law?

Have you heard of forced sales of land in your community to pay taxes?

Do you know of cases of the exercise of the right of eminent domain in your community? For
what purposes? Was it exercised by local, state, or national government?

In what ways does government control the use to which you may put the land on which you live?

In what township do you live? school district? congressional district? state legislative district?
revenue district?

CHAPTER XV

CONSERVING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES

RESOURCES OF THE SOIL

In the preceding chapter we learned that as a nation we have not been altogether thrifty in
the disposal and use of our public lands. The same thing will have to be said regarding the
use of the resources of the land, of which the soil is by far the most valuable.

It is said that 1200 boys in Ohio, organized in clubs, increased the average yield of corn
from 35 bushels to 81 bushels per acre. The average returns per acre from the soil of the United
States were lower before the war than in any European country, except Russia. The following
table gives the production per acre of four cereals in the United States and five European
countries in 1913. The same relative position of the United States would be shown if we took
the average production of these countries for a series of years.

PRODUCTION IN BUSHELS PER ACRE UNDER CULTIVATION IN 1913

ABILITY OF THE AMERICAN FARMER

The low position of the United States in agriculture is by no means due to inferior ability
on the part of the American farmer. The Secretary of Agriculture says that

Even now no farmer in the world can compare with the American farmer in agricultural efficiency.
His adaptability to new and changing conditions, to the use of improved machinery and processes,
coupled with the great natural resources with which the nation is endowed, make him far superior
to any of his competitors. It is true that he does not produce more per acre than the farmers
of some other nations. Production per acre, however, is not the American standard. The standard
is the amount of production for each person engaged in agriculture, and by this test the American
farmer appears to be from two to six times as efficient as most of his competitors.

WASTEFULNESS OF EARLY FARMING

As long as we had a great abundance of unoccupied land it would perhaps have been uneconomic
to increase the production of that which was occupied by the costly methods of agriculture
used in Belgium, Germany, and other thickly settled countries. But the old methods of farming
not only failed to get from the soil all that it was then capable of producing, they also robbed
it of fertility without restoring to it what was taken from it. Thus the loss caused by wasteful
methods was passed on to future generations. To continue such methods in the light of our present
knowledge and with our growing population is thriftless in the extreme. Methods of preserving
and restoring the fertility of the soil and of obtaining the largest returns from it are now
receiving the most careful attention from both state and national governments.

IDLE LANDS

A great deal of land lies idle that might be productive of food-- not only arid, swamp, and
cut-over lands, mentioned in later paragraphs, and land held for speculation, but also vacant
lots and unused back yards in cities and villages, and waste or unused portions of cultivated
farms. It is largely from city and village lots that the School Garden Army obtained its remarkable
results. It is astonishing how many farmers buy instead of raising their vegetables for the
table, as well as feed for their stock.

Texas, for instance, has purchased $200,000,000 worth of food products yearly from northern
markets which might have been produced more cheaply at home. It takes 15 to 20 acres of land
in Texas to grow cotton enough to buy 160 bushels of canned sweet potatoes, while one acre
of Texas soil would produce the same quantity, and uncanned. [Footnote: THRIFT, a monograph
published by the National Education Association, 1918.]

Such topics as the following should be studied, consulting parents, farmers of the locality,
and such printed sources of information as are available.

The important cereal crops of your state. The average yield per acre of each. Increase or decrease
in yield in recent years.

The work of corn clubs and other boys' and girls' clubs to increase the yield of crops in your
state.

The difference between "production per acre" and "production per person engaged in agriculture."

The difference between "intensive" and "extensive" agriculture.

"Single crop" and "diversified crop" types of agriculture in your locality. Advantages of each.

Extent to which farmers of your locality raise their own table vegetables and stock feed.

Evidence furnished by your town, or neighboring towns, during the war, of the wealth-producing
power of vacant lots or unused backyards.

RECLAMATION OF ARID LANDS

Much of our public land has been nonproductive solely because of the lack of moisture. In 1902
a law known as the Reclamation Act was passed by Congress, providing that the proceeds from
the sale of public lands in states containing arid regions,[Footnote: The states to which this
law applies are Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. See map.]
except such as were already devoted to educational and other public purposes, should be used
for the construction and maintenance of irrigation works. This reclamation work is in charge
of the Reclamation Service of the Department of the Interior, whose engineers have built great
dams and reservoirs from which the water has been led by canals and ditches into the desert.
By 1916 more than 1,000,000 acres had been irrigated under this act, the crop value in that
year reaching $35,000,000. The reclaimed land is disposed of to actual settlers in accordance
with the homestead laws, each homesteader repaying the government in annual installments the
cost of reclaiming the land he occupies. The fund so created is used by the government for
further reclamation projects. The Department of Agriculture sends its experts to advise with
the farmers in regard to the problems peculiar to the reclaimed regions. "Every effort should
be and is, therefore, being made to promote the success of the farmer, and on the basis of
his success to increase the prosperity of the country." [Footnote 2: Report of the Reclamation
Service, 1912- 1913, p. 4.]

The Yuma project in Arizona opened a new Valley of the Nile where four crops of alfalfa are
now raised on what once were arid lands. The streets of Yuma and Somerton are crowded with
the automobiles of farmers, enriched by thousands of acres of splendid long-staple cotton,
alfalfa, corn, and feterita. Another irrigated valley in Arizona, that of the Salt River, has
few superiors in the world and has come in three years into great prosperity. Arizona planted
to cotton last year 92,000 acres. Its crop was 96 per cent perfect, the best record in the
United States. [Footnote: Arthur D. Little, "Developing the Estate," ATLANTIC MONTHLY, March,
1919.]

The principal irrigation projects of the Reclamation Service are shown on the accompanying map.

RECLAMATION BY STATES AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE

Five or six times as much arid land has been reclaimed by private enterprise as by the Reclamation
Service. The first extensive irrigation project in the West was a cooperative enterprise by
the Mormon colonists in Utah. It is said that about two fifths of the land irrigated in the
United States is supplied with water by works built and controlled by individual farmers or
by a few neighbors, while another one third is supplied by stock companies. As early as 1877
Congress passed "a desert land law," by which homesteads were granted in the arid lands on
condition that the settlers should irrigate the land. In 1894 the Carey Act was passed by Congress
under which the national government may give to a state as much as a million acres of arid
public land within its borders, on condition that the state provides for its irrigation. The
work is done by private stock companies, with whom the state makes a contract for the purpose.
The most extensive irrigation project undertaken by private enterprise is that of the Imperial
Valley in California, which derives its water from the Colorado River. Under the laws of California
the Imperial Valley region has been organized as an "irrigation district," with power to levy
taxes for the development and support of the irrigation work. Each state in which irrigation
is practiced has its own laws regulating the use of water by farmers and other consumers.

The theory is that the state regulates the appropriation of the water, exercising this power
and holding the land in trust for the public ... It is the duty of every state to which the
Reclamation Act is applicable to assist with every resource under its control.[Footnote: Water
Supply Paper, 234, U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, p. 66.]

Reference has been made in Chapter XIV to the proposed plan for the reclamation and settlement
of new areas of arid land by returning soldiers.

SWAMP LANDS

There are probably 80,000,000 acres of swamp lands in the United States which could be made
productive by drainage. Farmers themselves could reclaim much of this land at comparatively
small cost, greatly increasing their own profit and the wealth of the country.

One farm in Wisconsin has 40 acres of poorly drained land that in its present condition is
practically worthless. $25.00 per acre spent in drainage will make this 40-acre tract the equal
of any in the district, and good land is selling there at $150.00 per acre. [Footnote 2: "Unprofitable
Acres," in YEAR BOOK, Department of Agriculture, 1915, P. 147.]

The national government has at various times granted to the states swamp lands aggregating
60,000,000 acres, with the expectation that the states would reclaim them. The states have,
however, done very little to fulfill the expectation. These swamp lands are among those whose
reclamation by returning soldiers is proposed by the government.

Investigate and report on the following topics:

CONSERVATION OF WATER POWER

By the construction of dams, reservoirs, and canals the waters of a few of our streams are
turned to the work of reclaiming land. Our unused water resources are very great. Niagara Falls
have been harnessed for industrial uses, and with only a small part of their power in use they
light the streets and houses, run the street cars, and turn the wheels of industry in Buffalo
and Toronto and the neighboring region. But so far we are making use of less than 10 per cent
of the power easily available from our streams. "The water now flowing idly from our hills
to the sea could turn every factory wheel and every electric generator, operate our railroads,
and still leave much energy to spare for new developments." Our nation has allowed many of
the best water power sites of the country to fall into the hands of private speculators who
hold them undeveloped, as in the case of farmlands, forests, and other resources.

CONSERVATION OF FLOOD WATERS

Floods are not only immensely destructive of property, causing a loss of $100,000,000 along
the Mississippi River alone in a single year, but they carry to the sea water that might be
used for irrigation and for industry. Reservoirs, such as are built for irrigating projects,
regulate the flow of water in streams and prevent floods. In New England and New York reservoirs
have been built for this very purpose, and probably 10 per cent of the flood waters that originate
in these states is saved in this way and turned to industrial uses. Similar conservation of
flood waters occurs in Minnesota, but it is estimated that for the country as a whole not more
than one per cent of the flood waters is saved. [Footnote: "Conservation of Water Resources,"
Water Supply Paper 234, U.S. Geological Survey, 1919.] There are areas in which the reservoir
system is impracticable, as in the lower Mississippi Valley. Here all that can be done is to
protect the adjacent land by means of levees while controlling the floods farther up the valley.

FUEL RESOURCES

Larger use of water power would conserve another valuable resource--coal. Of this fuel we have
vast resources--"in West Virginia alone more than Great Britain and Germany combined." But
the supply is not inexhaustible and we are mining it and using it in an extravagant manner.
The loss here is not merely of heat and power and light, but of many valuable products of coal,
including dyes, ammonia, vaseline, and many others.

DESTRUCTION BY FLOODS

Floods are increasing in the United States. This is due chiefly to the destruction of our forests
by wasteful lumbering and by fire. In forested areas the ground absorbs the rainfall more easily,
while in areas barren of trees and other vegetation it runs off the surface. The destruction
of the forests, therefore, involves not only the loss of the timber, but also the loss caused
by the floods, including the washing away of the soil.

THE FOREST RESERVES

In 1891 Congress authorized the President to establish "forest reserves," the first to be created
being the "Yellowstone Park Timberland Reserve." From time to time new reserves were established,
and in 1907 the name was changed to the National Forests. In 1917, more than 176 million acres
were included within the National Forest boundaries, 21 million acres of which, however, belonged
to private owners. They are administered by the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture,
at the head of which is the Chief Forester. They are grouped in seven districts with a district
forester in charge of each. Over each of the 150 forests in the seven districts there is a
forest supervisor; and each forest is further subdivided into ranger districts under district
rangers who not only look after timber sales and the use of the forests generally, but also
"help build roads, trails, bridges, telephone lines, and other permanent improvements."

A ranger must naturally be sound in body, for he is called upon to work for long periods in
all kinds of weather. He must also know how to pack supplies and find food for himself and
his horse in a country where it is often scarce. Besides a written test, prospective rangers
are examined in compass surveying, timber work, and the handling of horses. [Footnote: "Government
Forest Work," Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, p. 15.]

There are also employed in the Forests great numbers of logging engineers, lumbermen, scalers,
planting assistants, guards, and others. In the great war, the Forest Service raised two regiments
of men who went to France to assist in the various kinds of forestry work necessitated by the war.

WORK OF THE FOREST SERVICE

The purpose of the Forest Service is to secure the use of the forests "in such a way that they
will yield all their resources to the fullest extent without exhausting them, for the benefit
primarily of the home builder. The controlling policy is serving the public while conserving
the forests." [Footnote: "The Status of Forestry in the United States," Forest Service Circular
167, 1909, p. 5.] Timber is cut and sold, but always with a view to developing future growth.
The forests are protected against fire. Burned-over areas are reforested by planting. Water
power sites are protected. The freest possible use of forest pasture land is permitted, but
under such regulations as to prevent injury to the forests and the denudation of the land by
overgrazing. In 1915, nine million cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were pastured in the forests.
In 1916 it was said that "more than 20 million dollars will probably be spent in the next ten
years in building good roads in the National Forests." [Footnote 2: "Opening up the National
Forests by Road Building," YEAR BOOK of the Department of Agriculture, 1916. Also reprinted
in separate Leaflet No. 696.]

WASTE OF TIMBER RESOURCES

But our timber resources are not all in the National Forests, and the waste continues to an
appalling extent.

With a total annual cut of 40,000,000,000 feet, board-measure, of merchantable lumber, another
70,000,000,000 feet are wasted in the field and at the mill. In the yellow-pine belt the values
in rosin, turpentine, ethyl alcohol, pine oil, tar, charcoal, and paper stock lost in the waste
are three or four times the value of the lumber produced. Enough yellow-pine pulp-wood is consumed
in burners, or left to rot, to make double the total tonnage of paper produced in the United
States.

But the wastes in lumbering, colossal though they are in absolute amount, are trivial compared
to the losses which our estate has suffered, and still endures, from forest fires. The French
properly regard as a national calamity the destruction of perhaps a thousand square miles of
their fine forests by German shells. And yet the photographs that they show of this wreck and
utter demolition may be reproduced indefinitely on 10,000,000 acres of our forest lands swept
each year by equally devastating fire for which our own people are responsible. You have doubtless
already forgotten that forest fire which last autumn, in Minnesota, burned over an area half
as large again as Massachusetts, destroying more than twenty-five towns, killing 400 people,
and leaving 13,000 homeless. [Footnote: "Developing the Estate," ATLANTIC MONTHLY, March, 1919,
pp. 384-385.]

The nation has been defrauded of a great deal of wealth in timber by speculators who have taken
advantage of the homestead laws.

Single tracts of 160 acres often have a value for the timber alone of $20,000 ... Lands acquired
... under the guise of the homestead law are to-day in the hands of lumber companies who promptly
purchased them from the settlers as soon as the title passed, and are either reserving them
for later cutting or are holding the land itself after cutting for from $40 to $60 an acre,
or even more--a speculative process which effectively prevents the possibility of men of small
means acquiring and establishing homes there. [Footnote 2: "The National Forests and the Farmer,"
in YEAR BOOK, Department of Agriculture, 1914, p. 70.]

To prevent this sort of thing, the government now sells the timber and the land separately,
withholding from agricultural entry heavily timbered land until the timber is cut off.

In the Kaniksy National Forest, in Idaho and Washington, timber sales have been made to include
much of the remaining agricultural timberland. Within eight years fully 10,000 acres of land
will be made available for settlement. Permanent homes will be established and there will be
available for the use of the communities approximately $225,000 for roads and schools, their
share of the proceeds from the sale of the timber. [Footnote 3: IBID., p. 71.]

STATE FORESTS

Besides the National Forests, there are more than 4,000,000 acres of STATE FORESTS.

Twenty-four states have forestry departments, sometimes under a state board or a commission,
sometimes under the control of a single state forester, as in Massachusetts and Virginia. In
New York, New Jersey, and Wisconsin the state forestry is a part of the work of a general "conservation
commission." In Connecticut it is centered in the state agricultural experiment station, and
in Texas in the agricultural college. In South Dakota the state forester is under the "commissioner
of schools and public lands." So there is great variety in the organization of forestry work,
and great variation in the amount and kind of attention given to it.

PRIVATELY OWNED TIMBERLANDS

The difference between the number of states having state forests and the number having forestry
departments is due to the fact that the public forests embrace only a small part of the timbered
land of a state. It will be noted from the table on page 225 that only one southern state (North
Carolina; two if Maryland is counted) has state forests. Six of them (eight with Maryland and
Virginia) have state forestry departments. More attention is now being given to forest preservation
and use in the South than these facts indicate, because of cooperation between state and national
governments, chiefly through the county agents. Such cooperation also exists in the northern
states. The map on page 242 shows cooperation for fire protection in New Hampshire.

VOLUNTARY PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS

The conservation of our forest resources requires cooperation on the part of citizens. In many
states there are "timberland owners' fire protective associations," in 1917 about fifty of
them. There is an American Forestry Association that publishes a magazine devoted to forestry,
AMERICAN FORESTRY; a Society of American Foresters; The Camp Fire Club of America, with a committee
on conservation of forests and wild life. Besides, there is a considerable number of local
associations with similar purposes.

EROSION

It is not always realized how important to our welfare the forests are, especially from the
point of view of agricultural production. A very large part of the timbered area of the United
States is in small woodlands on privately owned farms. Not only are the timber resources themselves
of great value, but the relation of woodland to agriculture is very close, especially in its
effect upon soil erosion.

Altogether it has been estimated that erosion is responsible for an annual loss in this country
of approximately $100,000,000. To the farmer it means money out of pocket from start to finish.
It impairs the fertility and decreases the productivity of his land, and may even ruin it altogether;
it renders irrigation more difficult and more costly; by reducing the possibilities of cheap
water power development it tends to keep up the price and check the more extended use of electricity;
and by interfering with navigation it helps to prevent the development of a comprehensive system
of cheap inland water transportation. But the farmer is not the only sufferer. The entire community
is directly affected by the loss and is justified in taking heroic measures to remedy the evil.

If the problem is to be solved we must cease to accelerate surface run-off by burning the forests
and brush fields, overgrazing the range, clearing steep slopes for agriculture, and practicing
antiquated methods of cultivation. On the contrary, the farmer, the forester, and the stockman
must cooperate in seeing that the land is so used that surface run-off, particularly at the
higher elevations, is reduced to a minimum.

Children in particular should have their interest actively aroused and their support enlisted.
In one state, "gully clubs" have been organized by the state forester. These are composed largely
of school children who take an active part in the work of gully reclamation and particularly
in finding and checking incipient gullies before it is too late. Why could not such organizations
as boy scouts, girl scouts, and campfire girls be used in the same way? [Footnote: "Farms,
Forests, and Erosion," YEAR BOOK of the Department of Agriculture, 1916, pp. 107-134.]

MINERAL RESOURCES

Soil, water, and forests are only a few of the rich natural resources of our country, although
they are among the most important. Great as the mineral production of our country now is, we
have only begun to open the mineral storehouse. On the other hand, we have been extremely wasteful
of some of our minerals, as in the case of natural gas, oil, and coal. The war has done more,
perhaps, than anything else to open our eyes to our mineral wealth and to convict us of our
wastefulness in the past. In the light of what it has shown us we should redouble our efforts
to conserve our resources. Our government has been gradually developing a program of conservation
which we should help to make effective. At the end of this chapter will be found references
to interesting accounts of our national wealth, and of what the government is doing to conserve
it in other directions than those described in this chapter. Many of these references are to
publications issued by the government itself, which can be obtained for the asking.

CHAPTER XVI

PROTECTION OF PROPERTY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS

DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY

There is nothing more discouraging than to have the product of one's labor swept away by disaster.
The farmer who has every prospect of a bumper crop after a hard season's work may have his
hope dashed by smut in his grain, or by a visitation of grasshoppers, or by storm and flood.
Cholera may carry off his hogs, or hoof-and-mouth disease his cattle. Rats and other rodents
may eat his grain. Fire may destroy his barn or his home. The thief may steal his pocketbook
or his automobile. His investments may prove unfortunate, or be swept away by somebody's bad
management or fraud. Some thoughtless boys or deliberate vandals may ruin in a few minutes
a beautiful lawn or trees that have taken years to grow and have involved great expense and effort.

THE NATIONAL LOSS FROM PROPERTY DESTRUCTION

The individual's loss is also a loss to the community. It is reported by the Department of
Agriculture that nearly $800,000,000 damage was done to crops by insects in a single year.
Animal diseases cause a direct loss to our country estimated at $212,000,000 annually. Hog
cholera alone costs $75,000,000 a year. Smut destroys more than $50,000,000 a year in cereals.
Food and feed products to the value of $150,000,000 a year are destroyed by prairie dogs, ground
squirrels, and other rodents. It is said that prairie dogs often take half the pasturage of
western cattle ranges. It is estimated that the killing of wolves, coyotes, mountain lions,
bobcats, and lynxes saved more than $2,000,000 worth of livestock in 1918. Floods have destroyed
$100,000,000 in property in the Mississippi Valley alone.

The loss from fire in the United States is said to equal the value of our total product of
gold, silver, copper, and petroleum.

The buildings consumed by fire in 1914, if placed on lots of 65 feet frontage, would line both
sides of a street extending from New York to Chicago. A person journeying along this street
of desolation would pass in every thousand feet a ruin from which an injured person was taken.
At every three fourths of a mile in this journey he would encounter the charred remains of
a human being who has been burned to death. [Footnote: "The Fire Tax and Waste of Structural
Materials in the United States," Bulletin 814, U. S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior.]

THE SERVICE OF GOVERMENT

Protection against loss of property is one of the chief services performed for us by our government.
We have already noted in Chapter XII what a great deal of work both the national and state
governments are doing to prevent loss of crops and of livestock from disease, insects, and
other causes. What this may mean to the individual farmer and to the country is suggested by
the case of a farmer who had hundreds of acres of corn destroyed in some manner unknown to
him. A single visit from a representative of the Department of Agriculture showed him the cause
of the trouble, the corn rootworm, and how it could be eradicated by a simple rotation of crops.
The farmer said that this knowledge would save him $10,000 a year.

LEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION

The state and national governments spend a great deal of money in equipping experimental laboratories
and employing scientists to seek out these enemies of the farmer and of the nation, to find
methods of destroying them or counteracting their effects, and to advise the farmer how he
may protect himself and his neighbors. While the government provides leadership in these matters,
it depends upon the cooperation of the people to get results, as we have seen in so many cases.
A farmer may destroy all the rats, or ground squirrels, or prairie dogs on his place, but the
trouble will be repeated unless there is community cooperation. The same thing is true of animal
and plant diseases, insect enemies, and so on.

NATIONAL COOPERATION FOR FLOOD PREVENTION

Some kinds of protection require effort beyond the powers of individual citizens, or even of
combined citizen action. This is the case with flood protection. Millions of dollars in property
have been destroyed, thousands of lives lost, and untold suffering caused by the periodic recurrence
of floods in certain sections of the country, as in the lower Mississippi Valley, or as in
Ohio, a few years ago. The individual farmer has some responsibility for such floods, because
by looking after his own drainage and preserving his own timberland he may help decrease the
amount of water that flows into the streams and ultimately causes such havoc farther down the
valley. But such efforts are helpful only in connection, with the larger efforts of the government.
Even state governments cannot alone control the floods, because the waters that cause damage
in Louisiana and Mississippi come from the states along the entire course of the Mississippi
River and its tributaries. Moreover, the destruction caused in Louisiana or any other state
is a loss to the entire nation. The control of floods requires the combined efforts of national
and state governments, as well as of local communities and individuals.

Levees have been built along some of our rivers that are subject to flood, notably the lower
Mississippi, where the work has been done by the joint action of the states affected, through
their local levee boards and their state boards of engineers, and the United States Mississippi
River Commission. The United States government has spent large sums for river improvements,
but there is a general feeling that the money has not always been wisely spent. At all events
the work has been restricted to navigable streams under the power of the national government
to regulate interstate commerce. Recently, however, the President has approved a law passed
by Congress appropriating $45,000,000 for the control of the floods of the Mississippi by improvements
from the headwaters of the river to the mouth of the Ohio. The law also includes the appropriation
of $5,000,000 for the protection of the Sacramento Valley in California. This law was passed
under the power given to Congress by the Constitution "to lay and collect taxes...for the common
defense and general welfare of the United States" (Art. I, sec. 8, clause i).

WORK OF THE UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU

Great saving of property has been effected by the United States Weather Bureau. The work of
this Bureau is wonderful, but it is not mysterious. Just as the movements of a ship or of a
railroad train may be reported day by day, and hour by hour, by telegraph, so the appearance
and movement of a storm center or of a cold wave or of a flood are reported from a multitude
of observing stations. There are central weather-forecasting stations at Chicago, New Orleans,
Denver, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C. Weather forecasts are made up at
these points from observations telegraphed in from observing stations, and within two hours
are telegraphed to about 1600 distributing stations, from which they are further distributed
to about 90,000 mail addresses daily, to all newspapers, and are made available to 5,500,00
x3 telephone subscribers. A farmer may call central by telephone and learn with remarkable
certainty what the weather for twenty-four hours will be, except in the case of local thunder
showers which may drench his fields while passing by those of his neighbor.

"It may be said without exaggeration that the San Francisco office of the Weather Bureau has
saved to the citrus fruit growers of California more money within the last five years than
the annual appropriation for the entire Bureau during a period of twenty years." "In the citrus
fruit districts of California it is reported that fruit to the value of $14,000,000 was saved...
during one cold wave." "The value of the orange bloom, vegetables, and strawberries protected
and saved on a single night in a limited district in Florida...was reported at over $100,000."
"The warnings issued for a single cold wave... resulted in saving over $3,500,000 through the
protection of property." "Signals displayed for a single hurricane are known to have detained
in port on our Atlantic coast vessels valued with their cargoes at over $30,000,000." Flood
warnings are sent in from about 60 centers along our rivers, enabling farmers to remove their
cattle from bottom lands, to save their crops when they are ready for cutting, and otherwise
to determine their farming operations. They are also of the greatest service to railroads,
business men, and home owners, in cities. These are but a few illustrations of the services
performed by the Weather Bureau.

Preventable Losses

A great deal of the property loss referred to is due to causes for which we are not responsible,
such as storms, the depredations of insects, and epidemics of animal disease. But some of it
is due to our own carelessness. It was said on page 176 that wastefulness is our chief national
sin. Carelessness is the twin sister of wastefulness; they go hand in hand. Enormous waste
is caused by fire, and most fires are due to carelessness--carelessness in handling matches,
in the use of oil stoves, in accumulations of rubbish, in disposing of hot ashes, in smoking
where there are inflammable materials.

Fire Protection in Cities

In cities and towns the safety of our own property from fire is largely dependent upon the
care of others. If our neighbor is careless, our property as well as his may be destroyed.
Under such circumstances it is necessary to have rules to regulate conduct for the common safety.
The materials with which we may build, the thickness of our walls, the construction of our
flues, the storage of explosive or inflammable materials, the disposal of rubbish and ashes,
and many other things, are regulated by law. This is cooperation for fire prevention. Much
money is also spent by cities for fire protection, including water supply and organized fire
departments.

FIRE PROTECTION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

Where people live widely separated from one another, as in rural communities, such regulations
are less necessary and organized fire protection is less easy to afford. A farmer's property
may be destroyed by fire from a spark from a passing locomotive, or from the camp of a careless
hunter in the adjoining woods. There may be state laws to control such cases. But in the main,
if his property burns it is due to the carelessness of some one who lives on the premises,
and he is dependent upon his own efforts to control the fire. Improved farm water supply with
adequate pumping facilities, the telephone by which neighbors may be summoned, and the automobile
by which help may quickly be brought, have increased the farmer's safety; but his chief safeguard
is the exercise of care by all who live on the farm at every point where a fire might possibly
be started.

FIRE INSURANCE

Fire insurance is a means of reducing the fire loss of individual property owners by a form
of cooperation. Insurance companies, operating under state laws, sell insurance to property
owners. The latter pay a small premium for the protection afforded. From the funds produced
by the premiums and the interest on their investment, the occasional losses of individuals
are paid. This does not prevent the destruction of the property, but it distributes the loss
among thousands of people, perhaps in all parts of the country.

FARMERS' COOPERATIVE INSURANCE

There are in the United States about 2000 FARMERS' COOPERATIVE FIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES, carrying
insurance amounting to more than 5 billion dollars. These companies are associations of farmers
who elect their own directors and manage their own insurance business. They provide insurance
at a much lower rate than the ordinary commercial insurance companies. A usual provision of
the laws under which these cooperative companies operate is that no member may insure his property
for its full value. His neighbors will help him bear his loss, but will not bear it all. This
has the effect of causing him to exercise greater care to prevent fire on his premises. For
this reason insurance does reduce the actual fire loss to some extent. Property may also be
insured against loss from storm and flood.

Improved means of fire prevention in country districts.

POLICE PROTECTION

All states have laws to protect their citizens against the "ill- mannered" who do not respect
property rights--thieves, burglars, highwaymen, vandals, sharpers, and others. The enforcement
of these laws is left largely in the hands of local community officers. Cities have police
departments, with large numbers of patrolmen and detectives whose business it is not only to
arrest violators of the law after the violation has taken place, but also by their vigilance
to prevent the violation from occurring.

RURAL POLICE PROTECTION

The state laws against the violation of property rights apply to rural communities as well
as to cities, and rural communities have officers for their enforcement--the constable in townships,
the sheriff and his deputies in counties. Where the population is small and widely scattered,
as in a rural township or county, about all the officers can do is to arrest law violators
after the commission of the unlawful act, if they can be found. The officers are too few to
watch isolated and remote property, and in case of serious disturbance, such as a riot, they
are too few to handle the situation effectively. Rural communities and many small industrial
or mining communities do not always have the protection they need against lawlessness. In such
cases the tendency is sometimes for the people to "take the law in their own hands." In times
of labor trouble mining companies and other industrial corporations have sometimes organized
their own police. Such practice is dangerous, for the enforcement of law should be in the hands
of the state, and not in the hands of an interested party. In early days on the frontier, in
mining and lumber camps, "vigilance committees" were common; and even now, in various localities,
we hear too frequently of "lynching parties," which are as lawless as the original offenders
against the law, and tend to create a disrespect for law.

And yet disrespect for law may also result from failure on the part of the community to enforce
the law through regular agencies, from failure of officers to apprehend offenders promptly,
or of courts to mete out justice promptly and impartially.

STATE POLICE Canada has been more efficient than the United States in affording protection
to remote and rural communities, by means of her national mounted police. "The isolated farmer
and his wife slept securely in their sod hovel beyond the frontier, because they knew that
a brave and swift corps of vigilant young athletes ... kept sleepless vigil. Life and property
were secure ... ." [Footnote: C.R. Henderson, "Rural Police," ANNALS American Academy of Political
and Social Science, 1912, p. 228.] In our own country Texas has her "rangers" who protect her
borders against raids; but the best example of rural policing in the United States is in Pennsylvania,
where there is a well-organized state police, or "constabulary," which has many times proved
its efficiency in protecting remote rural communities and homes, in bringing criminals to justice,
and in quelling riots in mining centers.

VANDALISM

A great deal of property is destroyed or injured by VANDALS. The original Vandals were a tribe
of Germanic peoples who invaded southern and western Europe in the Middle Ages, and who were
noted for their destructiveness of the beautiful buildings and other evidences of Roman civilization.
There seem to be vandals in almost every community, and sometimes they seem to be especially
numerous in small communities, perhaps because of the lack of police protection. Sometimes
vandalism is wanton,--that is, it results from an apparent love of being destructive. Most
often it is purely thoughtless. Few people would knowingly injure the property of another if
they would stop to think of their feelings if another should injure THEIR property. It is a
case of "bad manners." Moreover, it is not a "square deal" to injure another's property while
expecting one's own property to be secure. When vandalism occurs in a community it creates
a general feeling of insecurity and destroys the sense of freedom.

PUBLIC PROPERTY is often more likely to suffer from vandalism than private property. Some people
will mar the walls of public buildings, or make their floors filthy with expectoration, when
they would not think of doing so in private buildings. They will break shrubbery in public
parks, or despoil public flower beds, when they would not think of entering private premises
for such purpose. There seems to be a feeling that public property belongs to no one, or else
that, since it is public, any one is at liberty to do as he pleases with it. This, of course,
is foolish. It is as if a stockholder in a business corporation should injure or destroy the
corporation property, forgetting that he owned a share in it and suffered a share of the loss.

they are disfigured in any way.

THE SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS

When a thief or vandal takes or destroys another person's property, the loss of the property
is not the worst thing that happens, but the attack upon PROPERTY RIGHTS. The right to security
in one's possessions is among the most sacred rights of a free people, being classed with the
right to life, the right of free speech, the right of petition, the right to freedom of religion.
It is by securing these rights that the law makes us free. The sacred right to property is
as truly violated by one who steals a nickel as by one who robs a bank of a thousand dollars,
by one who ruins our flower bed as well as by one who burns our house. The amount has nothing
to do with it. The tax which the English government imposed on tea imported by the American
colonists was not a heavy tax, but the colonists objected because it was imposed without their
consent.

CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS

The citizens of a free country require protection of their property rights against infringement
by their government as well as by one another. The Revolutionary War was fought in defense
of this and other rights against violation by the English government. When the Constitution
of the United States was framed, the people refused to ratify it unless amendments were added
guaranteeing these rights. (Amendment V. See also Chapter XIV, p. 207). The Constitution also
provides that "no state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts" (Art.
I, sec. 10, clause I), and in various other ways protects our property rights. Our state constitutions
contain many similar provisions. Our governments have the power to take property in the form
of taxes, but under certain restrictions imposed by our constitutions to safeguard the rights
of the people (see Chapter XXIII).

OUR NATIONAL ARMY

It is to protect these RIGHTS, rather than property itself, that communities have their police,
that states have their militia, and that the nation has its army and its navy. Among the chief
causes that led us into war with Germany was the fact that Germany was violating the property
rights of our citizens. While our Constitution provides for state militia and a national army
for the defense of our rights, property rights included, it has always been our national policy
to maintain as small a standing army as is consistent with the national safety; and this for
the very reason that a large standing army and a large navy are not only a great burden of
expense, but also, as the founders of our nation believed, a menace to the liberties of the
people and to the peace of the world.

THE SERVICE OF THE COURTS

We have seen that no person may be deprived of property by the government "without due process
of law." This means that the procedure provided by law must be followed, and that the citizen
whose property is taken may have his side of the case presented, the value of the property
in question appraised by impartial judges, and so on. It is the business of THE COURTS to see
that justice is done. They inquire into the facts in the case, and interpret the law bearing
on it. The courts are the final safeguard to our liberties. Our government comprises, therefore,
not only a law-making branch and a law-enforcing branch, but also a LAW-INTERPRETING, OR JUDICIAL,
branch--the courts.

THE RIGHTS OF ACCUSED PERSONS

The Constitution guarantees justice to persons accused of violating the property rights, or
other rights of citizens, by theft, fraud, or otherwise, as well as to the citizen who has
been wronged. (Amendment VI). (Amendment VIII).

CHAPTER XVII

ROADS AND TRANSPORTATION

STUDIES OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ROADS

During the years 1910-1915 the Office of Public Roads of the United States Department of Agriculture
made a continuous study, year by year, of the methods and results of road improvement in eight
selected counties of the United States. [Footnote: Spotsylvania, Dinwiddie, Lee, and Wise counties
in Virginia; Franklyn County in New York; Dallas County in Alabama; Lauderdale County in Mississippi;
and Manatee County in Florida.] The results of the investigation are described in Bulletin
No. 393 (1916) of the Department of Agriculture, which is worth sending for and studying by
any school that is interested in the improvement of the community.

SPOTSYLVANIA COUNTY, VA

One of these counties was Spotsylvania County, Virginia, a map of which is shown on the opposite
page. Since the Civil War the farmland in this county had gradually declined from its prosperous
condition before the war until it was little better than a wilderness of second-growth timber,
valued at from $5 to $15 an acre. For many months of the year the roads were well-nigh impassable.
There was much wealth in timber, but it could not be marketed to advantage. The soil was very
little cultivated. More farm products were shipped into Fredericksburg, the only city in the
county, by rail from outside than were shipped out from the farms of the county.

MOVEMENT FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENT

Nearly one third of the population of the county lived in Fredericksburg; but under the law
of the state of Virginia the people of the city could not be taxed for county purposes outside
of the city. Moreover, two of the four districts of the county at first took little interest
in the matter of road improvement, although they had to use the roads in going to market at
Fredericksburg. Courtland and Chancellor districts, however, were determined to have better
roads, and voted to raise the necessary money by selling bonds to the amount of $100,000. Three
years later the other two districts, inspired by the success of Courtland and Chancellor districts,
also voted bonds for road improvement to the amount of $73,000. This debt would of course have
to be paid off by levying taxes upon the people of the districts. With a tax rate of $1.70
on every hundred dollars' worth of property, a farmer with a farm assessed at $3000 would pay
a total tax of $51, of which $19.48 would be for the roads.

COST MUST BE JUSTIFIED

It is not always easy to convince the people of a community that it is worth while to spend
so much money on their roads. They have to be shown that the expenditure will in due time pay
for itself, as well as add to the convenience and pleasure of the community. Too much money
spent in costly improvements on roads that are little used, or in construction that does not
stand the traffic and soon wears out, is of course a bad investment. But the results in Spotsylvania
County, as well as in the seven other counties studied by the Office of Public Roads, justified
the cost.

STATE AND LOCAL COOPERATION

The law of Virginia provided that all highway construction in the state must be supervised
by the STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSIONER. He accordingly appointed an engineer to supervise the work
in Spotsylvania County, the engineer's salary being paid by the state. The work of construction,
however, was under the direction of a COUNTY BOARD OF PUBLIC ROADS. The board appointed a superintendent
who hired all labor and teams and purchased all equipment and materials. Three main highways
in Courtland and Chancellor districts, and leading into Fredericksburg, were chosen for improvement.
Within two years more than forty miles of road were completed, or about 10 per cent of all
the roads in the entire county.

MONEY FOR REPAIRS

Roads have to be kept in repair after they are constructed. By 1914 money was needed for this
purpose. The farmers objected to further increase of the tax rate, so it was decided to charge
TOLLS for the use of the improved highways--5 cents for a single horse and vehicle, 10 cents
for two horses and a buggy, 15 cents for two horses and a wagon, 25 cents for four horses and
a wagon, and from 20 cents to 35 cents for automobiles. More money than was needed was raised
in this way in the first month, and the tolls were therefore reduced one half. One advantage
to the county of the toll system was that automobilists and others from other districts, counties,
and states would contribute to the upkeep of the roads.

EFFECT OF IMPROVEMENTS ON LAND VALUES

On the roads selected for improvement there were 35 farms including 5518 acres. In 1910, the
average value of these farms, including buildings, was $14 per acre, and seldom did any one
want to buy land in the neighborhood. But within two years after the road improvement seven
of the 35 farms had been sold, and a large part of another, as shown in the following:

In the next two or three years a number of other farms were sold at similar increased prices,
and some farms that had been abandoned were reoccupied. Large areas of land were cultivated
for the first time since the Civil War. The farmers were, however, most interested for the
time being in their timber wealth, and between 1909 and 1913 the shipments of forest products
from Fredericksburg increased 78.2 per cent.

THE AVERAGE HAUL

Before the improvement of the roads, the average weight of load for a two-horse team in the
winter and spring, when the roads were bad, was about 1200 pounds; when the roads were dry,
about 2400 pounds. The cost for hauling at this rate averaged, for the year round, about 30
cents per ton per mile. After the roads were improved, the average load the year round was
4000 pounds, and the cost for hauling only 15 cents per ton per mile.

Investigate and report on:

MONEY VALUE OF GOOD ROADS

Good roads pay, in dollars and cents, provided they are made of suitable materials and with
due regard to the kind and amount of traffic they are to carry. They permit of larger loads,
and more loads in a given time; they save wear and tear on horses, harness, wagons, and automobiles;
in the case of automobiles they save gasoline; they save the time of the farmer; they make
possible a more varied agriculture by making marketing easier; they add to the value of the land.

GOOD ROADS AND COMMUNITY LIFE

But good roads pay in many other ways than in dollars and cents. In Spotsylvania County, as
in other counties investigated at the same time, the improvement of the roads was followed
by a decided improvement in school attendance. In more than one case it led to the improvement
of the quality of the schools by the consolidation of a number of poor, one-room schoolhouses
into a single larger school with better equipment and better teachers (see Chapter XIX). The
relation between good roads and good schools is clearly suggested in one of the illustrations
in this chapter. So, also, good roads increase the ease with which the people of the community
may associate with one another, attend church or community meetings at the schoolhouse, and
enjoy the social life and entertainment of the neighboring city or village. When the road is
improved, the farmers along the way are more likely to keep the weeds cut, to repair broken
fences or build new ones, and otherwise to beautify the adjoining premises, which adds both
to the money value of property and to the enjoyment of life.

ROAD MAKING A COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE

Road making is necessarily a cooperative enterprise. In the first place, a public road serves
the common interest of the entire community. The community may, through its government, exercise
the RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN, taking land from adjacent farms for the purpose of laying out
a new road, provided, of course, that the farmers are paid for it. In the second place, the
making of a road is far too costly and difficult for an individual farmer to undertake for
the benefit he himself would derive from it. It requires a great deal of labor and a high degree
of technical skill.

ROAD MAKING A JOB FOR EXPERTS

It has been quite common for farmers themselves to work on the roads of their locality--"working
out" their road taxes. But roads so made are seldom very good, unless the work is supervised
by someone trained in the business. Whether a farmer works on the roads himself or merely pays
for having it done, it is to his advantage to know something about road making. The Department
of Agriculture and the state agricultural colleges now give extension courses in road making
for the benefit of the farmers. It is reported that in one county of Oklahoma the pupils of
forty different school districts have built more than forty miles of good roads, of course
working under supervision.

VALUE OF COUNTRY ROADS TO CITIES

Good country roads are of the greatest importance, not only to the farmers and rural communities,
but also to the people of cities. The road improvement in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, was
of as much benefit to the people and the business of Fredericksburg as to the farmers. An excellent
illustration of the recognition of the common interest of city and country in the public roads,
and of effective cooperation in improving them, was given in Chapter III, page 32, in the case
of Christian County, Kentucky. The wide use of the automobile has done a great deal to awaken
the people of cities to their interest in country roads, and associations and journals devoted
to the interests of automobilists have been active in advocating the improvement of the public
highways.

GOOD ROADS NOT MERELY OF LOCAL CONCERN

In Spotsylvania County we saw, also, that the improvement of roads in two districts was a direct
advantage to the farmers of the other two districts. Carrying this idea further, we shall see
that the roads of one county may be of the greatest importance to other counties in the state;
and those of one state of importance to other states. The crossties produced from the timber
of Spotsylvania County may be wanted for railroad building in a distant state. The cotton from
the plantations of Tennessee or Texas is needed at the mills in New England. The wheat of the
great farms of the northwest supplies the whole nation. Most of the freight carried on the
railroads and steamships has at some time and in some form been hauled in wagons and trucks
over country roads. It is clear, then, that the character of the highways in any locality is
a matter of national interest, and even of world-wide interest.

EARLY NATIONAL INTEREST IN ROAD BUILDING

When our nation was created, the question of highways at once became very important. The states
needed to be bound together, and the public lands must be settled. The Constitution gave Congress
the power "to establish post offices and post roads," and "to regulate commerce ... among the
several states"; but it was not clear how far these powers could be exercised for "internal
improvements." Roads and canals were proposed in great numbers. In 1806 Congress authorized
the building of the Cumberland Road, which began at Cumberland, Md., and was finally completed
as far west as Illinois. Road building was, however, left chiefly to the states and to private
enterprise. The Cumberland Road finally passed under the control of the states through which
it ran, and by them was given into the management of the counties. Many "turnpikes" were built
by private companies, which charged tolls for their use.

POOR ROADS IN THE UNITED STATES

The building of many canals and, later, the coming of railroads caused interest in public highways
to decline, and their building was left almost wholly to local initiative, where it remained
until very recently. The result is that the United States has had the poorest roads in the
civilized world. Under local management the cost of public roads fell chiefly upon the farmers,
cities escaping taxation for this purpose, except for their own streets. A road running across
a state might be well kept in some localities while allowed to run down in others. A community
was reluctant to spend money on a highway only to have the improvements destroyed by through
traffic from neighboring communities who had no responsibility for maintaining the road. Local
communities could not afford to employ expert officials to plan and supervise road construction.

STATE CONTROL OF HIGHWAYS

Under these conditions the road situation became so bad that public sentiment was gradually
aroused on the subject, and it was seen that a road was of more than merely local importance.
State control was agitated. New Jersey was the first state to pass a law placing the highways
within the state under state regulation. This was in 1891. Other states followed New Jersey's
example, until by 1914 forty-two states had state highway departments. These differ greatly
from one another in organization, powers, and efficiency. Unfortunately, "political influence"
has entered into road building and management in many states in such a way as to interfere
with efficiency;--that is, those in charge of roads have often been chosen for political reasons
rather than for their fitness for the work, and large sums of money have been spent unwisely,
if not dishonestly in some cases.

RECENT PROGRESS UNDER STATE CONTROL

In a number of states, STATE HIGHWAYS have been built. These are wholly state enterprises,
paid for and managed by the state. California has two trunk lines running the entire length
of the state, with branch lines connecting them with the county seats. To January 1, 1914,
Massachusetts had completed more than 1000 miles of state highways. New York has an extensive
system, and Maryland is another example. But the plan most commonly in use is state aid and
supervision in the construction of roads by counties. This was the New Jersey plan of 1891.
By it, plans for road improvement with state aid in any county must be approved by the state
highway department, and construction is supervised by state engineers. The cost is divided
between the state and the local community.

In New Jersey the property owners along the highway, who of course are most directly benefited,
were to pay one-tenth of the cost, the state one-third, and the county the remainder. In Wisconsin,
the board of county commissioners in each county is required to plan a "county system" of highways
to be a part of the state system. The cost of each county system is divided equally among township,
county, and state. The work is directed by a county highway commissioner, but in accordance
with plans and specifications of the state highway commission. In Ohio, a system of "intercounty
highways" is being built, connecting all the county seats of the state. Counties, towns, and
property owners along the highway must provide an amount equal to that provided by the state,
and the work is under the direction of the state highway department.

In Virginia the cost of highway construction is divided equally between state and local communities;
but the counties often accept from the state the labor of prison convicts instead of money.
Convict labor on the roads is quite common in southern states.

The money for state aid in highway building is commonly raised by the sale of bonds by the
state. For the maintenance of the roads after they are built, the proceeds from automobile
licenses are applied.

Our roads, even in remote rural districts, are of national importance for the reasons stated
on page 259. Moreover, they are becoming more and more used for the transportation of freight
and passengers over long distances, for which the introduction of the automobile and the motor
truck is responsible. Therefore, national cooperation is necessary for adequate road improvement.

WORK OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENT

The work of the national government on behalf of good roads has heretofore been largely educational
and advisory. In 1893 the Office of Road Inquiry (now the Office of Public Roads) was created
in the United States Department of Agriculture to investigate methods of road making and management.
The results of its investigations have been published for the benefit of the country. Advice
was given when asked for. Instruction was given through extension courses (p. 257). Here and
there model or experimental roads were constructed to test new methods or to serve as object
lessons to the localities where they were built. Good road building has also been greatly stimulated
by the extension of the rural free mail delivery, routes not being established unless the roads
are in reasonably good condition. The national government has also given to many states public
lands within their borders, the proceeds from which were to be used for road construction;
and a part of the proceeds from the sale of timber in the national forests is devoted to road
building in the locality.

FEDERAL AID ROAD ACT

In 1916, however, Congress passed the law known as the Federal Aid Road Act. This law places
the national government in the same relation to the states, in the matter of road building,
that the state governments have borne to the counties in granting state aid.

The Federal Aid Road Act appropriated 75 million dollars to aid states in improving their "rural
post roads," and 10 million dollars for the construction and maintenance of roads in the national
forests. Of the 75 million dollars for state aid in building post roads, 5 million dollars
were to be available the first year, 10 million the second, 15 million the third, and so on
for five years, when the total amount will have been used. The money is given to the states
only on their request, and on condition that each state shall provide an amount equal to that
received from the national treasury. The money is apportioned among the states on the basis
of area, population, and the extent of post roads in the state.

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE

The administration of the law is in the hands of the Office of Public Roads. The entire country
is divided into ten districts, over each of which is a district engineer. When a state desires
aid from the national government, its highway department must draw up plans for the improvements
proposed and submit them to the district engineer, who in turn submits them with recommendations
to the Secretary of Agriculture, whose approval they must have. Having obtained this approval,
the work is carried on by the state as in the case of other roads entirely under state control.

RESULTS OF FEDERAL AID

It is too soon yet to tell what the results of this new cooperative enterprise of the national
government will be. But the first important effect has been to cause the organization of state
highway departments in the few states that did not already have them, and the reorganization
of such departments in the states where they were weak; for the Federal Aid Road Act provides
that aid may be given to the states only on condition that they have effective highway departments.
The result is that every state in the Union now has an active highway department, and road
improvement is going on at a rate never before known.

THE NATION'S INTEREST IN TRANSPORTATION

Those who live in the most remote rural communities have a vital interest in the nation's transportation
system, including railways and steamship lines. As we have seen (p. 203), there was the closest
relation between the building of railroads and the opening of the public lands. The market
of the farmer and the source of his supplies are not merely the neighboring trading center,
but in far distant parts of the country and of the world. Without railroads, the farmer, the
manufacturer, and the city merchant would alike be helpless.

GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF RAILROADS

While our government has at times given direct aid to encourage the building of railroads,
as by the gift of public lands, they have been developed chiefly by private enterprise. They
are owned by private corporations which do business under charters granted by the state governments
(rarely by the national government) and regulated by law. Control over them has been exercised
chiefly by the state governments, except in matters affecting interstate commerce, which falls
under the control of Congress. As the parts of our country have become more closely bound together
and interdependent, largely by the influence of the railroads themselves, an increasingly large
part of commerce has become "interstate" in character, and railway transportation has become
more and more a national concern. The result is an increasing control by the national government

INTERSTATE COMMERCE

In 1887, Congress created an Interstate Commerce Commission with power to inquire into the
management of the business of "common carriers," such as railroads, steamship lines, and express
companies. It was later given power to fix rates which such carriers could charge. Other laws
were passed, such as the Sherman Act, or "Anti-Trust Law," of 1890, which made unlawful any
"contract, combination ... or conspiracy in restraint of trade." These and other laws checked
abuses that characterized railroad management at that time, but, on the other hand, they are
said in some respects to have hampered the economic and efficient development of the country's
transportation system. The Sherman Law, for example, absolutely forbade the consolidation of
competing railroad lines under one management, although such consolidation often makes for
efficiency and economy.

GOVERNMENT RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION IN WAR

When the United States entered the recent war, the weakness of our transportation system quickly
became apparent, and the need for the most effective transportation service led the government
to take unusual steps to secure it. The President issued a proclamation by which, in the exercise
of his WAR POWERS, he "took possession and assumed control of each and every system of transportation
in the United States and the appurtenances thereof." This meant assuming control over 397,000
miles of railways owned by 2905 corporations and employing more than 1,700,000 persons. The
management of this great transportation system was intrusted to a Railroad Administration with
a Director General of Railroads at its head. The ownership of these railroads, however, remained
with the private companies, which were to receive compensation for the use of their property,
and were to receive back the railroads after the war was over.

ADVANTAGES OF GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT

The whole purpose of the government in its management of the railroads was to win the war,
the convenience of the public being a minor consideration. The people cheerfully put up with
inconveniences of travel and with rates that they had not experienced while the roads were
under private management. On the other hand, there were certain decided advantages in the management
of all railroads as one great system. It meant the consolidation of competing lines that the
law itself prevented the railway companies from effecting, it meant shortening routes in many
cases, the use of common freight terminals by different lines, the increase of track facilities
and storage areas at seaport terminals, the selling of passenger tickets good over any one
of several roads running between two points.

There are those who believe that the railroads should be managed, or even owned, by the government
in time of peace as well as during war. There are others who believe as strongly in private
ownership and direction. Many of the latter believe, however, that a more perfect control should
be exercised over the privately owned roads by the government under laws that protect the interests
of the public and that at the same time permit, or even require, greater cooperation among
the roads than has heretofore existed. Since the war, bills have been introduced in Congress
looking to these ends, and doubtless the experience of the war will result in an appreciable
improvement in our country's railway transportation system.

WATER TRANSPORTATION

In the early days of our nation, rivers were used for transportation to a large extent, and
canals were proposed in great numbers, some of them being built and carrying a large amount
of traffic. The coming of the railroads caused water transportation to decline, to the nation's
great loss. The war stimulated the use of our waterways to a considerable extent, and any scheme
for transportation control in the future should provide for their fullest development as a
means of marketing the products of our farms, forests, mines, and factories.

There was also a time, in the early part of our history, when our seaports swarmed with American
ships that sailed every sea. Our shipping afterward declined because other nations built and
manned ships more cheaply than we could do. We allowed these other nations to carry our commerce.
We deplored the fact that our merchant marine had disappeared and discussed ways and means
to restore it. But all to no purpose, until the great war came; then we HAD to have ships.

EFFECT OF WAR UPON OUR MERCHANT MARINE

When we entered the war we had almost no ships. Congress created the United States Shipping
Board and its Emergency Fleet Corporation. As a result, and within a year's time, the United
States took rank as the leading shipbuilding nation in the world. It has more shipyards, more
shipways, more ship workers, more ships under construction, and is building more ships every
month during the war than any other country. Prior to the war the United States stood a poor
third among the shipbuilding nations. Since August, 1917, more seagoing tonnage has been launched
from American shipyards than was ever launched before in a similar period anywhere. [Footnote:
"Shipping Facts," issued by the U.S. Shipping Board, September, 1918.]

Moreover, under the stress of necessity methods of shipbuilding and operation were developed
that ought to make it possible for the United States to compete successfully in the future
with other nations, even though our workmen and sailors are paid more than those of other nations.

The chairman of the shipping board said, "The American community must think of ships as a local
improvement." This means that the business and welfare of every American community, whether
a seaport or a remote farming community, are dependent upon ships. By our merchant marine the
American farmer and the American businessman are brought into touch with the remotest parts
of the earth.

CHAPTER XVIII

COMMUNICATION

Roads and other means of transportation are important not only as a means of transporting products,
but also as a means of communication among the members of the community. Team work is impossible
without prompt and effective means of communication.

Tell what you know about the value of signals in getting team work in a football or baseball team.

Discuss the importance of means of communication in conducting military operations. What means
were used for this purpose in our Army in France?

How were military movements reported and directed in the Revolutionary War?

Andrew Jackson's victory at New Orleans was won a month after the War of 1812 was officially
ended. How did this happen?

What were some of the methods used by the American Indians to convey information between distant
points?

LANGUAGE AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION

One of the most interesting chapters in history is that relating to the development of means
of communication. Language itself is the most important of these means. It is not altogether
clear what the first steps were in the development of spoken language; but we know that among
uncivilized peoples conversation is aided, and often largely carried on, by signs made with
the hands. Written language certainly developed from the use of pictures, which were gradually
curtailed into HIEROGLYPHICS, such as were used by the ancient Egyptians, and finally developed
into the ALPHABET, each letter of which was originally a picture.

A story is told of a group of American Indians who some years ago visited an eastern city.
They could not make themselves understood, nor could they understand others, and became very
lonely. They were taken to visit a deaf-and-dumb institution, where they were quite delighted
to find that they could converse freely by the use of a natural sign language.

Uncivilized peoples are in the habit of conveying ideas in the most astonishing ways. For example,
among a certain African tribe the gift of a tooth brush carries a message of affection. These
Africans take great pride in their white teeth, and the tooth brush carries the message, "As
I think of my teeth morning, noon, and night, so I think often of you."

To illustrate the development of the alphabet from pictures, our letter M represents the ears
of an owl, which in Egypt was called MU, and the picture of which, later reduced to the ears,
came to represent the sound of M..

EFFECTS OF ILLITERACY AND INABILITY TO USE ENGLISH

The fascinating story of the development of language cannot be told here. It is referred to
because we are likely to forget what an important factor it is in making community life possible.
Inability to use a common language prevents intercourse and team work. Large numbers of men
drafted in the American Army were unable to understand the English language. Between 30,000
and 40,000 illiterates were taken in the first draft and it is said that there were nearly
700,000 men of draft age in the United States who could neither read nor write. They could
not sign their names, nor read orders or instructions. They had to be separated and taught,
thus greatly delaying the complete organization of our available fighting forces. Inability
to use a common language is equally an obstacle in industrial life, for non-English speaking
workmen are unable to understand instructions, or to read signs and warnings. Many accidents
are due to this cause. It is said that approximately 5 1/2 million of our population above
ten years of age cannot read or write in any language, and that 5 million of our foreign population
cannot use English. An active campaign is now being conducted to teach English to foreigners
and to eradicate illiteracy. A bill has recently been introduced in Congress to provide Federal
aid for this purpose.

If the productive labor value of an illiterate is less by only 50 cents a day than that of
an educated man or woman, the country is losing $825,000,000 a year through illiteracy ...
The Federal Government and the States spend millions of dollars in trying to give information
to the people in rural districts about farming and home making. Yet 3,700,000, or 10 per cent,
of our country folk can not read or write a word. They can not read a bulletin on agriculture,
a farm paper, a food-pledge card, a liberty-loan appeal, a newspaper, the Constitution of the
United States, or their Bibles, nor can they keep personal or business accounts. An uninformed
democracy is not a democracy. A people who cannot have means of access to the mediums of public
opinion and to the messages of the President and the acts of Congress can hardly be expected
to understand the full meaning of this war, to which they all must contribute in life or property
or labor.--SECRETARY LANE, Annual Report, 1918, p. 30. From letter to the President.

Ask at home: What is "illiteracy"? What is the difference between an "illiterate" and a non-English
speaking person?

Debate (or discuss):

RESOLVED, That ALL persons of sound mind in the United States should be required by law to
attend school until they are able to speak, read, and write English fluently.

RESOLVED, That the elimination of illiteracy and the teaching of English to foreigners should
be left wholly to the states without interference or aid from the national government.

Why are foreigners required to read sections from the Constitution of the United States before
they receive their "naturalization" papers?

What does "knowing how to read" mean?

Debate:

RESOLVED, That no native-born American should be permitted to vote who cannot read intelligently.

What is being done in your community and in your state to eradicate illiteracy and to teach
English to foreigners?

THE PRINTING PRESS AND NEWSPAPERS

Next to language itself, the most important invention for the communication of ideas is the
art of printing. It made possible the book, the magazine, the newspaper. The writer of this
book is enabled to communicate with boys and girls whom he will never see by means of the printed
page and the pictures which the book contains. By the same means the ideas of people who lived
long ago have been handed down to us, and the ideas of to-day will be passed on to later generations.
Most wonderful is the modern newspaper, which daily carries into almost every home of the land
the important happenings in the world during the preceding twenty- four hours. In cities several
editions are printed during the day. The newspaper enables the merchant to communicate, through
advertisements, with possible buyers, and the farmer and business man to keep posted regarding
crop conditions and market prices. Most newspapers have special departments for different classes
of readers--a woman's page, a children's column, a page devoted to sports, another to market
conditions. Most of them also have a department in which individuals may ask questions or express
their own opinions regarding questions of the day. The "local newspaper," with a circulation
that seldom extends far beyond the county in which it is published, is of the greatest value
in stimulating a community spirit.

THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH

The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that:

Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right
of the people peaceably to assemble...

The right of free speech and of a free press is a very sacred one, and its maintenance is one
of the chief safeguards of democracy. It is the means by which PUBLIC OPINION is formed and
made known; and public opinion is one of the chief means of control in a democracy. It controls
the conduct of individuals, and it controls the actions of government. The representatives
and leaders of the people in the government seek constantly to know what public opinion is,
and the public press is one of the chief channels through which they may find out. On the other
hand, leaders and parties seek to FORM public opinion, to lead the people to think in certain
ways and to support certain ideas. The press affords an effective means for doing this.

PROPAGANDA

It is easy to see that both good leaders and bad leaders may thus create public opinion, that
both good and bad ideas may be spread through the press. During the war we heard much about
German PROPAGANDA. This means that ideas were systematically spread to create a public opinion
favorable to the German cause. It was done largely by rumors, springing from no one knows where,
and spreading by word of mouth. But it was also accomplished through the newspapers, by news
items and stories that appeared to be true and that were published innocently enough in most
cases, but that afterward were found to be false.

THE DEVELOMENT OF PUBLIC OPINION

It is not to be supposed that all propaganda is harmful or dangerous. There is propaganda in
good causes, or on both sides of a disputed question. By this means public opinion is educated.
When the peace conference at Paris proposed a plan for a League of Nations, it was at once
taken up for discussion through the newspapers and magazines. People who believed in the idea
organized a campaign of PUBLICITY to support the plan and to create a public opinion for it,
while those opposed to it were equally active in their attempt to create a public opinion against
it. In this way the people became informed regarding the question, provided they read both
sides of the discussion and not one only. Leaders in the community may conduct propaganda through
the newspapers in behalf of better schools, better roads, woman suffrage, prohibition, or any
other cause.

The good citizen cannot well get along without the newspaper and magazine. But he needs to
keep in mind the fact that news items may be in error, and that the opinions expressed by editors
and other writers usually represent the opinions of but a single group of people, which may
be large or small, right or wrong. In most cases these writers are sincere, but there is always
the chance for error. The intelligent citizen will not base his own opinions and actions solely
on what he reads in ONE paper or magazine or book, but will seek to understand ALL sides of
a question. He is helped to do this by the great variety of publications available representing
every shade of belief, and by the freedom of speech and of the press under our system of government.

THE CONTROL OF FREE SPEECH AND A FREE PRESS

Freedom of speech and of the press does not mean that a citizen may always say anything he
pleases in public. At no time has one the right to attack the character of another by false
or malicious statements. This constitutes slander, or libel, and may be punished by the courts.
In time of war freedom of speech and of the press may be restricted to an extent that would
not be tolerated in time of peace, because if absolute freedom were permitted information might
be made public that would be helpful to the enemy, and propaganda started that would be dangerous
to the public safety. But even in war time, the people of a democracy chafe under restrictions
upon free speech and a free press, and it is often a delicate question to determine how far
such restriction is justifiable or wise.

Make a report on the invention of the printing press.

Is there more than one "local paper" in your town or county? Do these local papers take the
same position in regard to public questions? Do you read more than one?

POST-OFFICES AND POST-ROADS

Congress was given power by the Constitution "to establish post- offices and post-roads." There
had been a postal service in the colonies before the Revolution. During the Revolution Benjamin
Franklin was made Postmaster General, and he made the service as effective as it could well
be made under the conditions that existed in those times. The plan that he devised was continued
after the Constitution was adopted. In those days mails were sent from New York to Boston and
to Philadelphia two or three times a week. They were carried on horseback or by stage and by
boat. Sometimes a month was consumed by a trip that can now be made in a half-day. Postage
cost from six cents to twenty-five cents for each letter, according to the distance it was
carried, and had to be paid in cash in advance. Postage stamps were not introduced until 1847.
Often mail was allowed to accumulate until there was enough to pay for the trip. The isolation
of a remote rural community can well be imagined where the difficulties of communication were
so great, and where the scarcity of money made postage an important item.

RURAL MAIL ROUTES

In 1918 there were 54,345 post-offices in the United States managed by the Post-Office Department
at Washington, besides nearly 600 in the Philippines managed by the war Department, and a few
in the Panama Canal Zone. Of the 3030 counties in the United States, 3008 had rural mail routes
aggregating more than a million miles in extent, serving more than 6 million families, and
costing for operation more than 53 million dollars. This cost, however amounts to only about
$1.90 for each person served, or a little more than one cent for each piece of mail handled.
The aim is to make the postal service pay for itself, and in 1918 the receipts exceeded the
expenditures by more than 60 million dollars.

SPECIAL SERVICES OF THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT

The Post-Office Department not only provides for the transportation of ordinary mail, but through
its post-offices it sells money orders for the transmission of money safely through the mails;
it operates the parcel post by which merchandise may be transported, including farm produce
of many kinds; it administers the postal savings system. One of the interesting divisions of
the Post-Office Department is the Division of Dead Letters, to which is returned all mail that
fails to reach its destination. In 1918 there were returned to the Dead-Letter Division 14,451,953
pieces of mail. In these "dead letters" there were drafts, checks, money orders, and loose
money, amounting to $4,194,839.68. The failure of this mail to reach its proper destination
is due in very large measure to carelessness in addressing and to failure to place on the envelope
or package a return address. A great deal of loss and inconvenience could be avoided, and much
labor and expense saved for the postal service, if every one would see that every piece of
mail sent out is properly addressed and stamped, and has a return address in the upper left-hand
corner.

TRANSPORTATION OF THE MAILS

The efficiency of the postal service depends very largely upon the means of transportation,
from steamship and railway lines down to the country roads. Nothing else, perhaps, has stimulated
the improvement of roads so much as the rural mail service. It is the power granted by the
Constitution to Congress to establish POST- roads that enables the Federal government to aid
the states in road improvement. The development of fast mail trains and the introduction of
motor-truck service have been important steps in the improvement of the postal service in city
and country. The latest development is the transportation of mail by airplane. An aerial mail
route between Washington, D. C., and New York City was established May 15, 1918, and a round
trip daily is now made over this route, regardless of weather conditions. The flying time from
Washington to New York, with a stop at Philadelphia, averages two hours and thirty minutes,
or one half the time of the fastest trains. The Post-Office Department is planning an extensive
airplane mail service from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with various side lines; also to the
West Indies, Panama, and South America. The routes are partially worked out, and trial trips
have been made in some cases, as between New York and Chicago.

THE TELEGRAPH

We need only mention the important part played by the telegraph, the submarine cable, and RADIO-COMMUNICATION,
in binding together our nation and the world as a whole. Without them the modern newspaper,
with its daily news from every corner of the globe, would be impossible, our cooperation in
the great World War would have been extremely difficult, and the President probably would not
have left the United States to participate in the peace negotiations at Paris. Although the
first telegraph line in the United States was owned and operated by the government as a part
of the postal service, the telegraph service of the country has since been in the hands of
private corporations; except that during the war the Post-Office Department took over the management
of the telegraph and the telephone, as the Railroad Administration took over the transportation
lines.

THE TELEPHONE

As this chapter is being written, word has come that the Secretary of the Navy has talked by
WIRELESS TELEPHONE with the President of the United States while the latter was 800 miles out
at sea on his return from France. At the close of the war American aviators were talking with
one another from airplane to airplane, and receiving orders from the ground, by wireless telephone.
These instances suggest new possibilities of communication in the near future. Already the
ordinary telephone has practically made over our community life in many particulars. We can
hardly estimate its value in business and home life, in the city or on the farm. There are
about 8000 rural telephone systems in the United States serving the homes of two million farmers.
In 1912, out of seven hundred and eighteen telephone systems in North Carolina, about six hundred
and fifty were country telephone systems owned and operated privately by groups of farmers.
These included about 20,000 telephones and used approximately 35,000 miles of wire.

SERVICE OF THE RURAL TELEPHONE To call a neighbor and ask for the exchange of labor on certain
work, as threshing, haying, etc., is only the work of a moment. To have a definite answer immediately
is often worth much. To be able to 'phone the village storekeeper, who runs a country delivery,
and ask that supplies be sent out is a great convenience to the housewife. To 'phone the implement
dealer and learn whether he has needed repairs in stock and, if so, to have them sent out on
the next trolley car, if not to ask him to telegraph the factory to forward them immediately
by express, is a saving of time that often amounts to a large saving when the planting or harvesting
of crops is delayed because of needed repairs.

... farm homes have been saved from destruction by fire because of prompt help secured by word
over the telephone; ... valuable animals have been saved through the early arrival of the veterinarian
who was summoned by 'phone. ... Many an itinerant sharper's plans have been frustrated. ...
The sharper in disgust turns to other fields where there are no telephones over which to notify
his prospective victims of his game.

Business appointments, social appointments, discussions of social and church plans, to say
nothing of the mere friendly exchange of greeting over the telephone have probably compensated
every owner of a rural telephone many times over for the expense of it, if all business advantages
were ignored.

... At some seasons of the year the general summons to the 'phone gives notice that central
is ready to report the weather bureau's prognostication for the following day.

Ask at home, or have committee interview postmaster:

How is the postmaster in your post-office chosen? Are all postmasters chosen in the same way?

What are first-class, second-class, third-class, and fourth-class post-offices?

How are rural mail-carriers chosen?

Has rural mail delivery had the effect of causing road improvement in your county? If so, give
instances.

CHAPTER XIX

EDUCATION

DEMOCRACY DEPENDS UPON EDUCATION

Both the efficiency and the democracy of a community depend upon the extent and the kind of
education it affords to its people. Autocratic Germany had a most thorough-going system of
education, but a system that made autocracy possible. The common people were trained to be
efficient workers, and thus to contribute to the national strength; but they were trained TO
SUBMIT to authority, and not to exercise control over it. The kind of education that develops
leaders was given only to the few. The leaders of the German people were imposed upon them
from above; in the United States we are supposed to CHOOSE our leaders. In a nation whose aim
is to afford to every citizen an equal opportunity to make the most of himself and whose people
are self-governing, education must be widespread, it must develop the power of self-direction,
it must train leaders, and it must enable the people to choose their leaders intelligently.
When Governor Berkeley of Virginia reported to the king of England in 1671, "I thank God there
are no free schools nor printing; and I hope we shall not have these hundred years," he spoke
for the autocratic form of government which a hundred years later led the colonies to revolt,
and which in 1917 forced the United Stares into a world war.

GOVERNMENT BY MEANS OF EDUCATION

In a democracy government must be carried on largely BY MEANS OF education. There must be trained
leadership. And since the aim of democratic government is to secure team work in public affairs,
the people must have the tools of team work, such as a common language and other knowledge
that makes living and working together possible; they must have training that will enable them
to contribute effectively to the community's work, and an intelligent understanding of the
community's aims and ideals. And since government is controlled largely by public opinion,
the people must have an intelligent understanding of the community's problems. We had abundant
illustration during the recent war of the extent to which our government not only depended
upon highly educated men and women for leadership, but also used educational methods to secure
its ends.

THE COST OF EDUCATION

These facts explain why public education is the largest single item of expense in our government
(except in time of war). In 1914 nearly 600 million dollars were spent for public elementary
and high schools. Some 200 million dollars more were spent for private elementary and high
schools, and for universities, colleges, and normal schools, some of which are public and some
private.

INEQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL REQIUIREMENTS

If democracy is to be safe and efficient, every member must have a reasonable education. Every
state now has a compulsory education law, though these laws vary greatly. In some states every
child must attend school for seven years (7 to 14, or 8 to 15), and in one state (Maryland)
for eight years. In other states the period is less, sometimes as little as four years. In
most of the states there is an additional period, usually of two years (14 to 16), during which
children must remain in school unless they go to work. As a rule there are laws that forbid
the employment of children in industry before the age of 14. In some states they may go to
work as soon as they reach the age limit regardless of what their educational qualifications
are; in others they must have completed the eight grades of the elementary school; in others

[Editor's Note: Missing text.]

laws are not well enforced in some states. The facing table shows the number of children of
school age in and out of school in the several states in 1915-1916. For the country as a whole,
17.4 per cent of the children of school age were not in school.

"School terms are so short in many states and compulsory attendance is so badly enforced that
THE SCHOOL LIFE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON GROWING UP IN RURAL SECTIONS IS ONLY 4.5 SCHOOL YEARS
OF 140 DAYS EACH. In urban communities conditions are better, but far from satisfactory." [Footnote:
Bulletin, 1919, No. 4, U. S. Bureau of Education, "A Manual of Educational Legislation," p. 6.]

The facing table shows the number of days the public schools were open, the average number
of days of attendance by each pupil enrolled, and the rank of the state in each case, for each
state in the school year 1915-1916.

Why would it not be more democratic to permit children to attend school or not as they or their
parents wish?

similar statement made on page 136, Chapter XI.

It is advocated by many that schools should be open the year round. What advantages can you
see in the plan? Debate the question.

THE DISTRICT SCHOOL

The pioneer family was dependent at first upon its own efforts for the education of its children.
When other families came, a schoolhouse was built, a teacher employed and the work of teaching
the elements of knowledge was handed over to the school. This was the origin of the "district
school," which is characteristic of pioneer conditions. As the population grew and local government
was organized, the unit of local government tended to become the unit for school administration.
In New England this was the "town" or township; in the South it was the county; in the West
it was sometimes the township and sometimes the county, or else a combination of the two. In
a large number of the western states, however, and in a few of the eastern states, the district
school persists in many rural communities, a relic of pioneer conditions. It is often felt
that it is more democratic for each district to administer its own school, subject only to
the laws of the state.

Under the district system there is an annual school meeting of the voters of the district,
who vote the school taxes, determine the length of the school year, and elect a board of education
or school trustees. The trustees look after the school property, choose the teacher and fix
his salary, and in a general way manage the school business. Each school is independent of
all other schools.

TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION

Under the township system all of the schools of the township are administered by a township
board or committee (or by a single trustee in Indiana) elected by the people of the township.
The chief advantages over the district system are that all the schools of the township are
administered by a single plan, the taxes are apportioned to the schools according to needs,
and pupils may be transferred from one school to another at convenience. In New England two
or three townships are sometimes united into a "union district" supervised by a single superintendent.

COUNTY ORGANIZATION

Under the county system all the schools of the county are under the management of a county
board and, usually, a county superintendent. In 29 of the 39 states that have county superintendents
they are elected by the people, in 8 states they are appointed by the county board, in Delaware
they are appointed by the governor, and in New Jersey by the state commissioner of education.
Election of the county superintendent is losing favor on the ground that there is less assurance
of securing a highly trained man. The chart on page 293 shows a plan of organization for county
schools proposed to the legislature of South Dakota by the United States Bureau of Education.

ADVANTAGES OF SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION

Among the advantages of the county system are greater economy, more nearly equal educational
opportunity for all children of the county, and better supervision because of the larger funds
available for this purpose. It is under the county system of organization that the movement
for SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION is progressing most rapidly. By this is meant the union of a number
of small, poorly equipped schools into a larger, well-graded, and well equipped school. Its
advantages may best be suggested by an example.

By consolidation, 113 one-room schools and 4 two-room schools were supplanted by 20 consolidated
schools with two grade teachers; 6 with four grade teachers, 6 with five grade teachers; 2
with six grade teachers; and 1 with eight grade teachers--a total of 86 grade teachers doing
the work formerly done by 148 teachers, and doing it better. Fifteen of the schools have a
four-year high school course with an eight months' term. For the five-year period preceding
consolidation not more than half of the eighth-grade pupils attended high school; after consolidation,
an average of 96 per cent of the eighth-grade pupils went to high school.

The pupils are transported to and from school in hacks or motor- busses heated in winter. The
school buildings are equipped with running water, modern heating and sanitation, telephone,
restrooms for pupils and teachers, gymnasiums and outdoor physical apparatus, physical training
and athletic competition being carried on under supervision. The courses of study have been
enriched, increased attention is given to vocational work, and music and art receive attention
impossible in the district schools. Eleven of the schools have orchestras, and concerts are
held which the community as well as the schools attend. There are auditoriums used for community
lectures and concerts, Sunday- school conventions, community sings, parent-teachers' meetings,
and exhibits of various kinds.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

Public education was long restricted to the elementary school. High schools were at first private
academies designed to prepare for college the few who wished to continue their education. While
they still continue to give preparation for college, their development in recent years has
been largely for the benefit of the greater number of boys and girls who do not expect to go
to college. The high school naturally made its first appearance in cities. It requires more
elaborate equipment and more highly trained teachers, and its cost is at least twice that of
elementary schools. These facts, together with the small and scattered population of rural
communities, have been obstacles to the development of rural high schools. The consolidated
school has in large measure removed these obstacles, and a high school education is rapidly
becoming as available for rural boys and girls as for those who live in cities.

Report on:

school.

school.

Education must not only be within the reach of every citizen of a democracy, but it must be
of a kind that will fit him to play well his part as a member of the community.

EDUCATION FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS

The public schools now give more attention than formerly to the physical education and welfare
of the pupils (see Chapter XX, pp. 314, 315). The wide prevalence of physical defects disclosed
in the effort to raise an army during the recent war will doubtless cause still greater emphasis
to be placed on this aspect of education. Physical fitness is the foundation of good citizenship.
Provision for physical education and welfare has found its way into rural schools more slowly
than in city schools, as the following table shows. But our nation can be neither efficient
nor fully democratic until the physical well-being of all its citizens is provided for, and
the responsibility rests largely with the public school.

HEALTH WORK IN CITY AND RURAL SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES

[Footnote: Adapted from Dr. Thomas D. Wood, in New York TIMES Magazine, April 2, 1916.]

EDUCATION FOR VOCATIONAL FITNESS

It is a part of the business of education to fit every citizen to earn a living, for every
efficient citizen must be self-supporting and able to contribute effectively to the productive
work of the community. The interdependence of all occupations in modern industry and the necessity
for every worker to be a specialist make training essential for every worker who is to attain
success for himself and contribute his full share to the community's work. The war emphasized
strongly the nation's dependence upon trained workers in every field of industry.

NATIONAL AID FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION

One of the direct results of war needs was the passage by Congress, in 1917, of the Smith-Hughes
Act, providing for national aid for vocational instruction for persons over 14 years of age
who have already entered upon, or are preparing to enter, some trade. The instruction given
under the terms of this act must be of less than college grade. Every state in the Union has
met the conditions imposed by this law.

The Smith-Hughes Act created a Federal Board for Vocational Education to consist of the Secretaries
of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, the United States Commissioner of Education,
and three citizens appointed by the President, one to represent labor interests, one commercial
and manufacturing interests, and the third agricultural interests. The law appropriates national
funds to be given to the state for the establishment of vocational schools and for the training
of teachers for these schools; but each state must appropriate an amount equal to that received
from the national government. Each state must also have a board for vocational education, through
which the national board has its dealings with the state.

BREADTH OF PREPARATION FOR VOCATIONAL LIFE

The duty of the regular elementary and high schools is not to cultivate special vocational
skills; not to turn out trained farmers, or mechanics, and so on. But the work of these schools
should be such that their graduates will be better farmers, or mechanics, or lawyers, or doctors,
or engineers, or teachers, than they would be without it. First of all these schools should
produce workers who are physically fit for the work they enter. They should educate the hand
and the eye along with the brain. They should cultivate habits of working together, give instruction
regarding the significance of all work in community and national life, and by every means possible
prepare the pupil to make a wise choice of vocation. Moreover, the schools should provide a
breadth of education that will "transmute days of dreary work into happier lives."

MAKING LIFE EDUCATIONAL

Mr. Herbert Quick in his story of "The Brown Mouse," which is a plea for better rural schools,
says:

Let us cease thinking so much of agricultural education, and devote ourselves to educational
agriculture. So will the nation be made strong.

The life we live, even on the farm, is full of science and history, civics and economics, arithmetic
and geography, poetry and art. The modern school helps the pupil to find these things in his
daily life and, having found them, to apply them to living for his profit and enjoyment. For
this reason it works largely through the "home project," boys' and girls' clubs, gardening,
and many other activities.

A recent writer has said,

What is the true end of American education? Is it life or a living? ... Education finds itself
face to face with a bigger thing than life or the getting of a living. It is face to face with
a big enough thing to die for in France, a big enough thing to go to school for in America
... Neither life nor the getting of a living, but LIVING TOGETHER, this must be the single
PUBLIC end of a common public education hereafter. [Footnote: D. R. Sharp, "Patrons of Democracy,"
in ATLANTIC MONTHLY, November, 1919, p. 650.]

EDUCATION FOR LIVING TOGETHER

The more nearly the conditions of living in the school community correspond to the conditions
of living in the community outside of school, the better the training afforded for living together.
In many schools the spirit and methods of community life prevail, even to the extent of school
government in which the pupils participate.

Of this community pupils and teachers are members with certain common interests. Cooperation
is the keynote of the community life. The realization of this cooperation is seen in the classrooms,
in study halls, in the assembly room, in the corridors, on the playground. It manifests itself
in the method of preparing and conducting recitations; in the care of school property; in protecting
the rights of younger children; in maintaining the sanitary conditions of the building and
grounds; in the elimination of cases of "discipline" and of irregularity of attendance; in
the preparation and conduct of opening exercises, school entertainments, and graduating exercises;
in beautifying the school grounds; in the making of repairs and equipment for "our school";
in fact, in every aspect of the school life.

[Footnote: "Civic Education in Elementary Schools," p. 31, United States Bureau of Education
Bulletin, 1915, No. 17.]

THE SCHOOL AS A COMMUNITY CENTER

The schoolhouse is becoming more and more the center of community life. We have noticed how,
in Randolph County, Indiana, the consolidated school building affords a meeting place for all
sorts of community activities. The school law of California provides that:

There is hereby established a civic center at each and every public schoolhouse within the
State of California, where the citizens of the respective public school districts ... may engage
in supervised recreational activities, and where they may meet and discuss ... any and all
subjects and questions which in their judgment may appertain to the educational, political,
economic, artistic, and moral interests of the respective communities in which they may reside;
Provided, that such use of said public schoolhouse and grounds for said meetings shall in no
wise interfere with such use and occupancy of said public schoolhouse and grounds as is now,
or hereafter may be, required for the purpose of said public schools of the State of California.

STATE ORGANIZATION FOR EDUCATION

The schools of the local community are a part of the state school system. Education is considered
a duty of the state, though it is performed largely by local agencies. The constitutions of
all states make provision for it. State control and support of education are necessary if there
is to be equality of educational opportunity for all children of the state. Every state has
a department of education, and in most states each local community receives a portion of a
general state tax for school purposes. The state departments of education differ widely from
one another both in organization and in the effectiveness of their work. In most states there
is a state board of education, composed sometimes of certain state officials, including the
governor and the state superintendent of education, sometimes of citizens appointed for this
purpose alone by the governor or (in four states) by the legislature. In only one state is
it elected by popular vote. In all states there is also a chief educational officer, usually
called state superintendent or commissioner of education or of public instruction. In several
states women hold this position. The state superintendent is sometimes elected by popular vote,
sometimes appointed by the state board of education or by the governor. Under the state superintendent
there are deputy superintendents, heads of departments, and supervisors of the various branches
of educational work. The diagram on page 293 shows a plan of organization proposed for one
state by the United States Bureau of Education.

RELATION OF STATE TO LOCAL ORGANIZATION

The extent of the supervision and control exercised by the state department of education over
the schools of the state varies within wide limits. In some cases it is very little. In many
states there are state courses of study that are followed more or less closely by local communities.
In a number of states the textbooks used by all schools are selected either by the state board
of education or by a special state textbook commission. In New York State the examination questions
used in all schools are prepared by the state educational authorities. Some states furnish
text books free, and in a very few the state even prints all textbooks. It has not been easy
to work out a well-balanced plan of state administration of schools that would ensure a thoroughgoing
education for the entire state, and that would at the same time leave sufficient freedom to
local school authorities to adjust the work to local needs.

HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

Many of the states support higher educational institutions, such as state universities and
state agricultural colleges, at which attendance is free for citizens of the state. There are
also special state schools for defectives, such as the blind and the deaf.

POLICY OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TOWARD EDUCATION

The national government gave its first support to public education by the Ordinance of 1787
under which the Northwest Territory was organized. As new states were organized, sections of
the public lands were to be reserved for school purposes. Grants of public land were also made
for the establishment of agricultural colleges and experiment stations.

THE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION

We have also noted the national cooperation with the states for agricultural extension work
and for vocational education. The United States Bureau of Education is under the direction
of the United States Commissioner of Education. It has exerted its chief influence through
its investigations of educational methods and its numerous reports and other publications.
It serves as a sort of educational "clearing house" for local and state school authorities.
One of its chief endeavors has been to increase the educational opportunities in rural communities.

Report on the following:

Provisions of your state constitution with regard to education.

CHAPTER XX

THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH

PHYSICAL DEFECTS AND THE NATIONAL DEFENSE

There is nothing else that concerns the community or the nation so much as the health of its
citizens. Of more than three million men between the ages of 21 and 31 examined for military
service in 1918, only about 65 per cent were passed as physically fit to fight for their country.
[Footnote: Public Health Reports, U. S. Public Health Service, vol. 34, No. 13, p. 633 (March
28, 1919).]

The remaining 35 per cent were either totally unfit for any kind of service, or were capable
only of the less strenuous activities connected with warfare. Most of the defects found could
have been remedied, or prevented altogether, if proper care had been taken in earlier years.

PHYSICAL DEFECTS AND THE NATION'S INDUSTRY

The nation loses by this physical unfitness in other ways than in fighting power. Investigations
have shown that wage earners lose from their work an average of from six to nine days each
year on account of sickness. In addition to this, the country loses the wage earner's production.
Sometimes death brings to the family permanent loss of income, and to the nation complete loss
of the product of the wage earner's work. The nation spends large sums of money every year
in providing for dependent families and individuals.

If each of the 38 million wage earners in the United States in 1910 lost 6 days from work in
a year, how many days' work would the nation lose? How many years of work would this amount to?

At $2.50 a day (is this a high wage?) how much would be lost in wages in a year?

Get information regarding the cost of a long case of sickness, such as typhoid fever, in some
family of your acquaintance (perhaps your own), including doctor's bills, medicines, time lost
from work, etc.

What would such expense mean to a family living on as low wages as those mentioned on page 167?

EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL DEFECTS

Moreover, the nation loses a great deal (how much cannot be calculated) from the physical unfitness
of many who keep on working, but who are not fully efficient because of bodily defects or ailments.
We see the results of this even in school. Pupils who lag behind their mates in their studies
are often suffering from physical defects of which their teachers, and even they themselves,
may be unaware. It may be that they are ill-nourished, or that they have defective vision,
or hearing, or teeth, or that they sleep in poorly ventilated rooms. The community does not
get its money's worth from its schools if its children are not in physical condition to profit
by them. In a similar manner earning and productive power are reduced.

PHYSICAL UNFITNESS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

It has usually been assumed that the people in rural districts are more healthy than those
who live in cities; but it has been found that there is as much physical unfitness there as
elsewhere. It is true that the records of the war department seem to show fewer men rejected
in rural districts as totally unfit for any kind of military service; but evidence of other
kinds has been collected that indicates that some kinds of disease, at least, and many physical
defects are more prevalent in the country than in the city. In THE LURE OF THE LAND, Dr. Harvey
Wiley makes a comparison of the death rate from certain diseases in a few states where the
figures are available for both city and country.

[Footnote: Dr. Harvey Wiley, THE LURE OF THE LAND, Chapter VIII, "Health on the Farm," pp. 53-60.]

RURAL AND CITY SCHOOL CHILDREN COMPARED

Studies have been made of the comparative health of city and rural school children, which show
results in favor of the former. Of 330,179 children examined in New York City 70 percent were
found defective, while of 294,427 examined in 1831 rural districts of Pennsylvania 75 per cent
were defective. The preceding chart shows the comparative prevalence of health defects among
city and country children.

Investigate the following:

Meaning of "vital statistics." Importance of vital statistics to your community. Where recorded
for your county or town. What the vital statistics of your community for the last year show.

Causes of deaths in your community for the last year. The percentage of these deaths that were
"preventable." Increase or decrease of death rate in your community during recent years, in
your state.

The nature of the prevailing sicknesses in your community during the last year. Per cent of
these that were contagious. List of contagious diseases in the order of their prevalence.

Quarantine regulations in your community against contagious diseases. Extent to which they
are observed. Who is responsible for their observance? For their enforcement?

Observe condition of sidewalks and other public places with respect to expectoration. Is there
a law on the subject in your community'? Is it observed or enforced? Who is responsible? Dangers
from expectoration.

Medical inspection in the schools of your county, town, and state. If any, its results. Kinds
of defects most commonly found. How is it conducted? Who sends the inspectors? To what extent
the homes of the community cooperate with the schools in getting results from medical inspection.

BETTER CONDITIONS IN CITIES DUE TO ORGANIZED TEAM WORK

We may well ask why ill health and physical defects seem to be more prevalent in rural communities
than in cities. The answer probably is, simply, that in cities they are PREVENTED more effectively.
The chart on page 313 shows that while the death rate in New York City was 20.6 per thousand
in 1900, it had declined to 14 per thousand in 1914; while that in the rural districts of New
York State remained practically the same during these years (15.5 per thousand in 1900, 15.3
in 1914).

This indicates that health conditions in the city were originally much worse than in the country.
They were rapidly improved by organization for health protection. There is not the occasion,
in rural communities, for the elaborate health-protecting organization that is now found in
all large cities, because the people in rural communities are not so completely dependent upon
one another nor at the mercy of conditions over which, as individuals, they have no control.
And yet even in rural communities physical well-being depends largely upon organized team work.

SCHOOLS AS AN AGENCY FOR HEALTH CONSERVATION

Cities have used their school organization to combat physical defects and weaknesses of pupils,
and that is why they make a better showing than rural communities in such matters as those
shown in the table on page 312. Removing such defects from young people means a stronger and
more efficient adult population ten or twenty years from now; for these defects are often the
causes of more serious illness in later years. The table on page 299, Chapter XIX, shows how
much behind cities rural communities have been in the use of their school organization for
this purpose. The encouraging thing is, however, that rural communities are beginning to find
the means to use their schools in this way. The way has been opened by school consolidation
(p. 295), by the grouping of all the small and isolated schools of a county under a central
county administration (p. 294), by aid from the state, both in money and in supervision, and
by cooperation from the national government.

HEALTH EDUCATION FOR ADULTS IN CITIES

Cities have extended their health-educational work to the adult population. This takes place
in part through the schools also. Instruction given to children is of course taken home by
them. Visiting nurses employed by the schools visit the homes. Classes for mothers are conducted
at the school in the afternoon or evening. But more than this, city boards of health, often
in cooperation with the school authorities, conduct educational campaigns by means of literature
distributed to the homes through school children, by means of evening lectures and moving pictures,
and through the newspapers.

AGENCIES FOR HEALTH EDUCATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

Means are not wanting for similar work in rural communities. The homes may be reached by the
right kind of instruction in the schools. The classes or clubs for women conducted by women
county agents may be, and often are, used as means of health instruction. Public meetings at
the "community center" at the schoolhouse may be devoted at times to public health problems,
with lectures, moving pictures, and discussions. The local newspapers always afford a channel
through which to get matters of this kind before the people. Local and state boards of health,
the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Public Health Service may and do use these
and other agencies to reach the people.

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HOME

No matter how much machinery for cooperation we may have in our community, like that described
above, it cannot help much unless every family and every citizen cooperates intelligently.

In a large city, a small group of men, constituting the city council, may inaugurate measures
which will accomplish sanitary improvements at thousands of homes; but for the accomplishment
of sanitary improvements at 1000 farm homes at least 1000 persons ... must be convinced that
the sanitary measures are needed, become informed how to apply them, and be willing to put
them into operation.

[Footnote: RURAL SANITATION, by L. L. Lumsden, Public Health Bulletin No. 94, United States
Public Health Service, p. 10.]

THE IMPORTANCE OF PURE AIR

Pure air is essential to good health. It is not always easy to get in the crowded living and
working conditions of cities. There it is necessary to regulate these conditions by law, and
factories and tenements are inspected to see that they are properly ventilated and not overcrowded.
In rural communities there is less excuse for bad air, and the responsibility for it rests
more directly upon the individual, as illustrated on page 112, Chapter X.

BAD AIR AND THE SPREAD OF DISEASE

It might seem that it is nobody's business but our own how we live in our homes or at our work.
But bad air lessens vitality and nurtures disease. This reduces productive power. Moreover,
colds, influenza, and tuberculosis (of which more than a million people are constantly sick
in the United States), all of which are nourished in bad air, may be spread by contact, or
by food handled by those who are sick. People who live in bad air at home mingle with others
at church, in moving picture theaters, at school, in the courtroom, and in other public meeting
places, which are themselves often poorly ventilated. It is strange that court rooms, where
justice is administered, schools where children are prepared for life, and churches where people
worship, are so often badly ventilated.

Report on the following:

Is your schoolroom well ventilated? How do you know? What effect does poor ventilation have
upon your feelings and your work?

If the law requires school attendance, why should it also require good ventilation of the school?

If the ventilation of your school is not good, what may you do about it? Who is responsible for it?

Observe and report upon the ventilation of the court rooms, moving picture theaters, churches,
and other meeting places in your community.

PURE WATER AND HEALTH

Cities go to great expense to get an abundant pure-water supply. It is of the greatest importance
in community sanitation Impure water is one of the chief sources of typhoid fever and other
diseases of the intestines. About 400,000 persons have typhoid fever every year in the United
States, and 30,000 are killed by it; and it is unnecessary. We have from three to five times
as much typhoid as many European countries have, and for no other reason than that we are negligent.

PURE FOOD AND HEALTH

Pure, clean, wholesome food is equally essential. We need not dwell upon the importance of
the right kinds of food and well- cooked food. Much illness is caused by "spoiled" foods. Disease
germs may be carried by food as well as by water. Tuberculosis may be carried by milk, either
from diseased cattle, or from victims of the disease who handle the milk at some point in its
progress from the dairy farm to the home. The death rate among babies is appalling, especially
in cities, because of the use of milk containing germs of intestinal diseases. Typhoid fever
may be contracted from milk, green vegetables, and oysters from beds contaminated with sewage.

The food supply of cities passes through many hands before it reaches the consumer. At almost
every point it is protected by regulations and inspection. Most of it, however, comes originally
from the farm which is beyond the control of the city authorities. The producers and handlers
of food products in rural districts therefore owe it not only to themselves but also to their
city neighbors to exercise every possible precaution against the spread of disease. Such precautions
consist in cleanliness in handling and storing milk, butter, and meats; in the cleansing of
milk receptacles with pure water; in the proper location and construction of wells; in protecting
springs from surface drainage; in sanitary disposal of sewage and other wastes from the household;
in protection of food against flies.

SANITATION IN CITIES

In cities a great deal of attention is given to sanitation. Sewage is carried off by public
sewers. Householders are required to place garbage in sanitary cans, whence it is collected
and disposed of in such a way as not to pollute the soil. Ashes and refuse are carried away
from homes and shops, and the streets are cleaned daily. In rural communities such matters
are left almost entirely to the householder.

FLIES AS DISEASE CARRIERS

Exposed garbage, improperly built outdoor toilets, and stable manure are breeding places of
flies; and flies are notorious carriers of disease. Yet, out of more than 3000 homes in one
county in Indiana only 31 made provision to prevent stable manure from breeding flies, and
the same was true of only 1 out of more than 2000 homes in a county in North Carolina, and
only 86 out of nearly 5000 homes in an Alabama county.

DANGER FROM MOSQUITOES

Malaria is widespread in the United States and imposes a heavy toll upon the nation's health.
It is carried from one victim to another by a certain kind of mosquito, of which it is comparatively
easy to get rid by proper drainage of breeding places, by treating the surface of pools with
kerosene, by screening, and by seeing to it that rain barrels are covered and that tin cans
and other receptacles of water are not left lying around. But flies and mosquitoes do not stop
with fences, nor do they recognize city or county boundaries. Hence, individual effort without
community cooperation is likely to be useless.

POLLUTED SOIL AND HOOKWORM DISEASE

The terrible hookworm disease so prevalent in our southern states is caused by a minute worm
that infests soil polluted with sewage. It penetrates the soles of the feet of those who go
barefoot and the palms of the hands of those who work in the soils, finds its way through the
blood to the intestines, and thence to the soil again. An investigation in 770 counties in
11 states where hookworm disease is prevalent showed that out of 287,606 farm homes only six
tenths of one per cent disposed of their sewage in such a way as to prevent soil pollution.

Out of 305 homes in a little community in Mississippi, only 4 properly disposed of sewage.
When the first investigations were made, there were 407 cases of hookworm disease out of 1002
residents. Besides, there had been recently 12 cases of tuberculosis, 47 of typhoid fever,
184 of malaria, and 384 of dysentery.

Safe methods of disposing of sewage were introduced, houses were screened, an artesian well
was bored for a public water supply, and the community cleaned up generally. After these improvements
the various diseases almost entirely disappeared. Similar results were obtained in 99 other
communities in the southern states.

[Footnote: Report of the Rockefeller Foundation, 1917, pp. 136- 138.]

Topics for investigation:

NATIONAL CONTROL OF HEALTH CONSERVATION

Health protection, like education, has been considered primarily the duty of the state. But
many conditions affecting health have arisen that the state cannot completely control. Chiefly
under the power given to it by the Constitution to regulate foreign and interstate commerce
(p. 451), Congress has passed many laws that protect health, placing their enforcement in the
hands of the several departments of the national government.

HEALTH WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

The Department of Agriculture conducts much public health work, through its home demonstration
agents, its Office of Rural Engineering, which deals with problems of farm water supply and
rural sanitation, its Bureau of Entomology which wages war against flies and other disease-carrying
insects, and its Bureau of Animal Industry which inspects cattle, meats, and dairy products.
The Department of Agriculture also administers the Food and Drugs Act, the purpose of which
is to secure purity of food products and to require that they and medicinal drugs shall be
labeled in such a way as to show what they contain. Fraudulent and harmful "cures" and "patent
medicines" may thus be exposed.

THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE

The United States Public Health Service investigates diseases and health conditions and the
means of controlling them. It has given considerable attention to rural sanitation. It issues
reports and other publications of great value to the citizen, some of them being listed at
the end of this chapter. It has representatives in all important foreign ports, inspects all
ships that enter American harbors, and holds them in quarantine until they and their passengers
are given a clean bill of health. Cholera and other dangerous diseases have thus been prevented
from gaining a foothold on American soil.

HEALTH WORK OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS

The War Department has also waged a relentless warfare against disease, not only in the army
itself, but also in the Panama Canal Zone, Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and other regions
occupied by the army. The Department of Labor seeks to improve the physical conditions of labor
for both men and women, and its Children's Bureau is charged with a study of all matters pertaining
to the welfare of children. In the Department of the Interior the Census Bureau collects national
vital statistics; the Bureau of Mines has done valuable work for the prevention of accidents
in mines and mining industries; and the Bureau of Education seeks to promote physical education,
instruction in home economics, and education in the home relating to the care of children.

STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HEALTH PROTECTION

A very large part of the duty of health protection must, however, remain with the states. Every
state has its department of health, headed by a state board of health, or a commissioner of
health, or both. These departments differ greatly in their organization and in the extent and
effectiveness of their work.

NEW YORK STATE ORGANIZATION

One of the best organized state departments of health is that of New York. Among its most important
features are (1) a PUBLIC HEALTH COUNCIL which has power to establish a state-wide SANITARY
CODE; (2) the concentration of all administrative power in the hands of a single state COMMISSIONER
OF HEALTH, who has a staff of experts to direct special lines of health work; and (3) a well-
organized scheme of cooperation between the state department and local health authorities.

LOCAL ORGANIZATION FOR HEALTH PROTECTION

The absence or weakness of local organization for health protection has been one of the obstacles
to progress in physical well-being in the United States. Driven by an appalling death rate
and frequent epidemics, our large cities have developed health departments which in many cases
have proved very effective. But in smaller communities, while health departments or health
officers usually exist, the organization has for the most part been very ineffective. The people
themselves have not been sufficiently aroused to their needs and to methods of meeting them.
New York and Massachusetts are among the most progressive states in this matter. Each local
community in these states (town, village, or small city) has its board of health and health
officer; but these communities are grouped into HEALTH DISTRICTS (8 in Massachusetts, 20 in
New York), each district being in charge of a health officer appointed by the state commissioner
or board of health. In New York the district health officer, who is there called the SANITARY
SUPERVISOR, has the following duties:

To keep informed regarding the work of each local health officer within his sanitary district.

To aid the local health officers in making health surveys of the community under their control.

To aid each local health officer in the performance of his duties, particularly on the appearance
of contagious diseases.

To hold conferences of local health officers.

To study the causes of excessive death rates.

To promote efficient registration of births and deaths.

To inspect all labor camps and to enforce in them all public health regulations.

To inspect Indian reservations and to enforce all provisions of the sanitary code in them.

To secure the cooperation of medical organizations for the improvement of the public health.

To promote the information of the public in matters pertaining to the public health.

EXAMPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA

Another type of local health organization and of cooperation between local and state authorities
for health protection and promotion has been developed in North Carolina, where 85 per cent
of the population is rural. Here the county has been taken as the unit of local organization.
Health conditions had been very bad in this state, hookworm disease, tuberculosis, malaria,
and other diseases being prevalent. The state board of health, assisted by the Rockefeller
Sanitary Commission (see above, page 320, and references below), began an investigation and
an educational campaign among the people, with the result that many of the counties of the
state now have an organization for health cooperation unsurpassed, perhaps, in any other state.
Each county has a health department, which is controlled jointly by the state board of health
and a county board of health. The county board of health consists of the mayor of the county
seat, the chairman of the board of county commissioners, the county superintendent of schools,
and two physicians of the county elected by the other three members. The work of the health
department is directed by a county health officer, who is appointed by the state board of health
of which he is also a member. He has a staff of trained assistants.

In this plan note the cooperation between state and local communities, between town and county
officials, and between the school authorities and the health organization. Note, also, the
leadership of specialists in health matters.

Topics for investigation:

Organization of the department of health in your community (both county and town): the board
of health; the executive health officer or officers; the kinds of work done.

Reports of the Rockefeller Foundation, 61 Broadway, New York City. This does not mean to get

depends largely upon our freedom and ability to choose the kind of service for which we are
best fitted, and upon the extent to which we prepare ourselves for it. It also depends to a
large extent upon good health (p. 309).

SATISFACTION OF HIGHER WANTS

But there never was a truer statement than that "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
In return for his work every citizen is entitled to enough compensation to enable him to provide
not only for the bare necessities of life, such as food and shelter, but also for the pleasure
that he derives from the satisfaction of his higher wants, such as social life and recreation,
an education that will give him a richer enjoyment of life, pleasant surroundings, religious
advantages.

EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY LIFE

All these things have much to do with our national well-being and our citizenship. Our nation
is democratic only in proportion to the equality of opportunity enjoyed by all citizens to
satisfy these wants. Moreover, the efficiency of each citizen in productive work and as a participator
in self-government depends more than we sometimes think upon his opportunity to "enjoy life"
in pleasant surroundings and in wholesome social relations. In the past the citizen has been
left largely to his own resources and to purely voluntary cooperation to provide for these
wants. Government has not even adequately PROTECTED his rights of this kind, to say nothing
of positively PROMOTING them. At present, however, community team work through government is
being organized as never before both to promote and to protect the interests of all citizens
in the fullest possible enjoyment of life.

RECREATION AND SOCIAL LIFE

THE VALUE OF PLAY

Children enjoy play because it satisfies physical, mental, and social wants. But it is also
the principal means by which they prepare for the more serious duties of later life. It builds
up health, trains the muscles and the senses, and sharpens the wits. It gives practice in team
work, develops leadership, and teaches the value of "rules of the game." Every child is entitled
to an abundant opportunity to play, both because of the happiness it affords him and because
by it he is trained for membership in the community. It is to the interest of the community
to afford him the opportunity. It is largely for this reason that most of the states protect
children by law from being put to work for a living at too early an age.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLAY IN CITIES

In large cities thousands of children live in crowded districts where there is no place to
play except in the public streets. So little appreciative have we been of the importance of
play in the development of young citizens that great numbers of city schools have been built
with no provision whatever for playgrounds. This mistake is slowly being corrected, often at
great expense. No city school is now considered first-class if it does not have an ample and
well-equipped playground, with competent directors to teach children how to get the most out
of their play. Most cities are also establishing public playgrounds apart from the schools,
sometimes under the management of the school board, but often under that of a special playground
or recreation commission.

PLAY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

Play for the children of rural communities is as important as for those of cities, but even
less attention has been given to it. Many a country school has no playground, and if it has
one it is likely to be small and not equipped with play apparatus. Why should there be playgrounds
when there is all outdoors in which to play? Why should there be expensive play apparatus and
play directors when boys and girls can get all the "exercise" they need at home or on the farm?
"Play" means more than mere physical exercise, and must be pleasurable if it is to have value.
Organized play is as truly a means of education as any school instruction, and must have competent
leadership or direction. In rural districts, where the children live far apart, there is particular
need for a common meeting place for organized group play, and the school is the most appropriate
place for it.

ARGUMENT FOR SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION

The need for organized play in rural communities is one of the best arguments for school consolidation,
for it brings together larger numbers and makes possible the employment of a competent play
director and the proper equipment of the playground. Teacher- training schools now make a point
of training play leaders as well as teachers of arithmetic and geography.

MEANING OF RECREATION

As children grow older, an increasing part of their time must be given to work--school work,
tasks at home, remunerative employment outside of the home. After leaving school and throughout
adult life, work absorbs the major part of one's time and attention. But even then, "all work
and no play" will continue to "make Jack a dull boy." We now call play "recreation," for by
it body and mind and spirit are refreshed, renewed, RE-CREATED, after close application to
work. That is why school work is broken by "recesses." Recreation is necessary as a means of
providing for physical, mental, and social wants; for the pleasure that it affords. But it
is also important in its relation to work, for without it body and mind become "fagged," people
grow "stale" at their work, producing power and power of service are reduced.

THE HABIT OF PLAY

It is very easy to get out of the habit of play, and especially difficult to form the habit
in adult life if it has not been done in youth. People often become so absorbed in work that
there seems to be no time for recreation. In such cases not only is the enjoyment of life narrowed,
but there is a risk of damaging the quality of one's work and even of shortening one's life
of productive activity, or of service.

LEISURE A REQUIREMENT

Every worker is entitled to opportunity for recreation, both for his own sake and for the well-being
of the community. This means, first of all, that he must have LEISURE for it. When people have
to work hard for ten or twelve or more hours a day, year in and year out, as was once customary
in industry, there is neither time nor energy for wholesome recreation. That such conditions
existed, and still exist to a considerable extent, is due to gross imperfections in the industrial
organization of the community. One of the evidences of progress toward "transmuting days of
dreary work into happier lives" is the reduction in the hours of toil in many industries, and
the consequent increase of leisure for the enjoyment of life and for self-improvement.

One of the things for which labor unions have struggled is the shortening of the working day.
Through their efforts, and through the awakening of public interest and knowledge in regard
to the matter, the working day is now fixed by law at eight hours in most industries, often
with a half holiday on Saturdays. Experience has shown that this change has in no way reduced
the product of industry. There are still some industries, however, in which men toil at the
hardest kind of labor for twelve or more hours a day, sometimes even including Sundays.

A LIVING WAGE A NECESSITY

A second thing necessary to afford opportunity for recreation is an income from one's work
sufficient to provide more than the bare necessities of life. Before the war, it is said, more
than five million families, or about one fourth of the families in the United States, were
trying to live on a wage of $50 a month, or less. During the war, wages of skilled and unskilled
labor shot upward; but so, also, did the cost of living. It is not easy to determine just what
share of the proceeds of industry should, in justice, go to the laborer in wages. But it should
be enough to provide not only for food and clothing and shelter, but also for decent family
life, for healthful surroundings, for education for the children, and for wholesome recreation.

Labor unions and others interested in a fairer distribution of the proceeds of industry have
long been working for the enactment of "minimum wage laws," that is, laws fixing the least
wage that may be paid for each class of labor, this to be enough to provide a reasonable satisfaction
of all the wants of life. Some states have already enacted such laws, and during the recent
war the federal government in some cases fixed rates of wages, and appointed labor boards to
adjust wages to the rising cost of living.

THE WISE USE OF LEISURE

Neither leisure nor income, however, suffice for recreation unless they are wisely used. Mere
idleness is not recreation; and many people use their leisure in DISSIPATION instead of in
recreation. "Dissipation" is the opposite of thrift. It means to "throw away," or to be wasteful.
A person may "dissipate" his income. We have come to understand the word "dissipation," however,
to mean excessive indulgence in pleasures or amusements that are wasteful of time, energy,
or health, or all three, and we call the person "dissipated" who is addicted to such indulgence.
Any amusement, even though harmless in itself, may become dissipation if indulged in to excess,
or at the sacrifice of other things that are better.

RURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECREATION

One of the principal disadvantages often put forward against life in rural communities is the
lack of opportunity for recreation. It partly explains the difficulty of obtaining an abundance
of farm labor, and is one of the obstacles to inducing young people to remain on the farm.
Unfortunately, too, the women on the farm have often been the chief sufferers from close confinement
to the drudgery of housework, with little opportunity for recreation and less chance than the
men have to enjoy the companionship of other people.

The very nature of farming entails hard work and long hours, especially at certain seasons.
Under existing conditions it is hard to see how the farmer's working day could be limited to
eight hours as in most other occupations.

The citizen farmer who lives in the same community with the miner ... must invest in land and
buildings, tools and livestock. He must pay taxes and insurance and repairs and veterinary
fees. He must work often sixteen hours, seldom less than ten, and he must be on duty day and
night, ready always to care for his independent plant--all this, and yet in order to receive
a labor income equal to that of the soft coal miner ... the farmer must not only work himself
as no professional laborer ever works, but he must also work his children without pay.

[Footnote: E. Davenport, Dean of the College of Agriculture, University of Illinois, in "Proceedings
of the First National Country Life Conference," Baltimore, 1919. p. 183.]

IMPROVED CONDITIONS ON THE FARM

Although this only too faithfully describes living conditions on the farm as they have been
in the past and still are in many cases, much improvement has taken place. Improvement of agricultural
machinery and methods has brought a greater measure of leisure to the farmer, while better
means of transportation and communication have both saved him time and made easier for him
and his family association with other people and the enjoyment of entertainment in the neighboring
village or city. The farm woman has benefited by the introduction of labor-saving devices and
better management in the household, and by the development of community cooperation in such
matters as dairying and laundry work (see pp. 106, 107). In fact, better team work in every
phase of the business of agriculture means greater opportunity for the enjoyment of living,
and the efforts of the national and state governments to encourage such team work and to improve
the methods of agriculture have for their purpose not merely the increase of the agricultural
product, but also the greater happiness of the rural citizen.

FACILITIES FOR DISSIPATION

When leisure may be found for recreation, the facilities for it are often inadequate. The city,
and even the village, affords facilities for amusement and social enjoyment that good roads,
automobiles, and trolley lines have made more accessible than formerly to the country round
about. While the urban community naturally affords greater opportunity than the rural community
for social recreation, its opportunities for dissipation are equally great. "Going to the movies"
may be a real recreation, or it may become a dissipation when indulged in to excess without
discrimination as to the merit of the performance. Almost every village has its well-known
"loafing places," and the saloon used to be a favorite meeting place for certain classes of
people. Amusements that are especially harmful are more or less regulated by law. Even moving
pictures are "censored." Saloons have now been totally abolished.

FACILITIES FOR RECREATION

The most effective preventive of dissipation is ample provision for wholesome recreation. Various
agencies in urban communities seek to supply this need, both for their own residents and for
visitors from outside. Men's clubs, such as chambers of commerce, afford social and amusement
advantages for the business men of the town, and for visiting farmers who formerly met only
at the store or courthouse, in the saloon or on the street corner. Public libraries, often
with the cooperation of women's clubs, provide "rest rooms," arranged for the comfort and entertainment
of visiting women, and afford means of profitable and enjoyable recreation for young people.
Town churches sometimes maintain social rooms, open during the week for similar purposes. The
Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations have performed a great service by providing
entertainment and social life for young people. One of the more recent developments is the
"community center," usually at the schoolhouse, where there are offered lectures and concerts,
social entertainments, dances, games, and sports. In some large cities such "recreation centers"
are of the greatest value in the crowded districts.

OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL

Rural communities have suffered from a dearth of recreational facilities of their own, especially
of a SOCIAL type. One of the most promising influences to supply this deficiency is the CONSOLIDATED
SCHOOL, which makes provision for assembly halls, social gatherings, and recreation grounds
for young and old alike. An illustration of this is given in Chapter XIX (p. 296). Development
of community recreation centers at consolidated rural schools is going on rapidly in many parts
of the country.

Iowa affords a striking example of this. In that state more than 2000 one-room country schools
have been consolidated into something more than 300, and consolidation is still going on. Some
of these consolidated schools have five acres of land, where provision is made, not only for
gardening and farming activities, but also for picnic grounds and for fields for athletic sports
and contests. The buildings contain assembly halls, gymnasiums, and kitchens where food is
prepared for social entertainments as well as for school lunches and for the teaching of cooking.

NEED FOR LEADERSHIP

One of the chief obstacles to the development of rural community recreation has been the absence
of leadership. The consolidated school helps to remedy this. Other agencies, however, are doing
something to provide such leadership, among the most active of which is the county work department
of the Young Men's Christian Association, which has organized county-wide athletic associations
and rural play festivals and field days in many localities.

KNOWING HOW TO USE OPPORTUNITIES

There are agencies, or organizations, in almost every community that could and should serve
recreational ends. The trouble with many of us is not so much the lack of time or of the means
for recreation, but a lack of knowledge of how to get the most out of our recreational opportunities.
Hence the need for leadership. Hence, also, the need for an education that will open up to
us new avenues of enjoyment. Recreation may be obtained not only from athletic sports and social
entertainments, but from the fields and woods, from books and music and pictures, even from
VARIETY IN OUR WORK, if we only knew how to find it. The school is under as great obligation
to provide us with an education that will teach us this as it is to equip us to earn a living.

ATTRACTIVE SURROUNDINGS

APPRECIATION OF THAT WHICH IS BEAUTIFUL

Beauty in one's surroundings adds much to the enjoyment of life, and therefore, also, to one's
efficiency in work and as a citizen.

People are often apparently blind to the beauty that is around them. "Having eyes, they see
not; and ears, they hear not." Those who live in the open country are surrounded by natural
beauties of which city dwellers are largely deprived. Too often, however, they are unconscious
of them or indifferent to them. To the hard- working farmer a gorgeous sunset may be little
more than a sign of the weather on the morrow, and the beauty of a field of wheat or corn may
be lost in the thought of the toil that has gone into it, or of the dollars that may come out
of it. Fortunate is the rural dweller whose toil and isolation are tempered by an appreciation
of the beauties of the natural world about him!

ITS CULTIVATION

Love for and appreciation of that which is beautiful may be cultivated. It is a part of one's
education. The schools now give more attention to it than formerly; but many of them do not
yet give enough. Appreciation of beauty is cultivated not merely by instruction in "art," but
also by those studies that increase one's knowledge of the common things about us. The teaching
of agriculture and of science has a very practical purpose; but its purpose is only partly
accomplished if it teaches us how to raise corn or cotton without opening our eyes to the wonders
of nature involved in the process.

An appreciation of beauty may be cultivated, also, by association with it, as it may be destroyed
by constant association with that which is ugly. People who live in unkempt and slovenly surroundings
are likely to become indifferent to them. It is the duty of every one to have a care for the
appearance of his surroundings both because of its effect upon himself and its influence upon
others.

IMPORTANCE OF APPEARANCES

A stranger who visits our school is likely to judge it, first of all, by its appearance. He
will note whether or not the building is in good repair, the condition of the grounds and fences,
the presence or absence of flower beds, shrubs, and trees. Inside, he will observe the cleanliness
and orderliness of the room, the decorations on the walls, the presence or absence of pictures
and flowers and plants; yes, and also the care the pupils and teacher take of their personal
appearance. These things are signs to the visitor of the interest taken by pupils, school authorities,
and the community in their school. They are also signs of the character of the work done in
the school, and of the happiness of the pupils.

A COMMUNITY JUDGED BY APPEARANCES

In a similar manner, the visitor to your community will form his first opinion of it by its
appearance. He will note, first of all the appearance of the homes, and then, probably, the
cleanliness and state of repair of the streets or roads. He will observe the condition of the
fences, and whether or not the weeds are cut along the roads. He will notice, also, the extent
to which the people love flowers, and care for trees and vacant lots. All of these things will
be signs to him of the prosperity, the happiness, the "community spirit," of the citizens.
They will doubtless enter into his decision as to whether or not he cares to live, or establish
a business, or educate his children, in that community.

COMMUNITY INTEREST IN BEAUTY

In cities a good deal of attention is usually given to such matters, and laws exist, with government
officers to administer them, for the protection and promotion of community beauty. In rural
communities these matters are left more largely to individual initiative and voluntary cooperation.
It becomes a matter of public interest and spirit on the part of the individual and the family.
It is true that some things are done through government authorities, as in the improvement
of the roads and the building of bridges and culverts that are of pleasing design as well as
serviceable. In some New England "towns" there are "town planning" boards, which carefully
plan for the laying out of streets and their improvement, the proper location of public buildings
and the style of architecture to be used, the location and development of parks and playgrounds,
the enactment of suitable housing laws, and other matters pertaining to the beauty of the community
as well as to the well-being of its citizens.

COMMUNITY PLANNING

Systematic planning of rural communities with a view to making them beautiful has not been
carried very far in this country. In fact, as one travels over a large part of the United States
one is impressed by the monotonous and unattractive character of the towns and villages. This
is not true everywhere, for in some parts of the country, usually those that have been settled
longest, one sees beautiful villages that fit harmoniously into the landscape. But over large
areas of the country it seems that wherever man has gone he has marred the beauty of nature.

INFLUENCE OF EXAMPLE

There is nothing in which the influence of example is so quickly seen as in matters relating
to appearance. People are prone to copy their neighbors in matters of style, whether it be
in dress or in architecture.

In one rather wretched community a few boys who were studying civics sought permission to lay
sod in the dooryard of a tenement house. Having obtained permission and laid the sod, it was
not long before some one else in the neighborhood did likewise, and soon people all around
were sodding their yards or sowing grass seed. Then they began to repair and paint their fences
and otherwise "tidy up" their places, until the whole neighborhood was transformed in appearance.
It is interesting to note, also, that as the community improved in appearance, it also became
less lawless than it had been.

This is one phase of community life in which it is easy to establish leadership, and in which
young people can perform valuable civic service and contribute materially toward "transmuting
days of dreary work into happier lives."

RELIGIOUS LIFE AND AGENCIES

GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION

In some countries church and state are inseparably bound together. Before the recent war the
Russian Czar was also the head of the Russian church. In our own country in colonial times,
no citizen was permitted to vote in the New England town meeting who did not belong to the
Puritan church of the community. This religious qualification for participation in government
was in the course of time dispensed with, and one of the fundamental principles of our democracy
is that every citizen shall have complete liberty of religious belief. Our government exercises
no control over the religious life of the people other than to guarantee this liberty. (United
States Constitution, Amendment I). State constitutions contain similar guarantees. To prevent
government interference with religion, religious institutions are exempt from taxation.

RELIGION A MEANS OF CONTROL

On the other hand, the church and other religious institutions are an important means of community
control. They do not exercise this control through government, but through the influence of
their own beliefs and organization upon the conduct of their members. If everybody should live
in accordance with the Golden Rule, there would be no need for government as a means of repression,
but only as a means of performing service.

RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AN OBSTACLE TO TEAM WORK

One of the unfortunate things about the church has been the fact that more or less important
differences in religious belief have tended to break up the community into numerous religious
groups, or churches. This may be necessary in purely religious matters, but it has too often
happened that the people have allowed their religious differences to prevent united action
in other matters of common interest to the entire community. In some cases communities have
been broken up into rival, or even hostile, factions because of this. There is, however, a
growing tolerance of one religious sect or denomination by others, which is in accord with
the Christian spirit, and is necessary if community life is to be well developed. It often
happens that there are more churches of the same denomination in a community than it can support.
In such cases, at least, there is need for church consolidation similar to the consolidation
of schools, and for the same reason.

SOCIAL SERVICE OF THE CHURCH

The church may be, and often is, an important agency in the community for the performance of
services other than that of ministering to the religious wants of the people. Or, to speak
more correctly, it has realized more or less fully that the religious wants of the people are
closely bound up with their other wants, and seeks to minister to these other wants as a part
of its religious duty. Thus, we find the church growing more active in looking after the health
interests, educational interests, and social and recreational interests of its members and others.

CHAPTER XXII

DEPENDENT, DEFECTIVE, AND DELINQUENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY

In every community there are some members who are not self- supporting and who do not contribute
materially to the community's progress (see Chapter V and Chapter XI).

WHO CONSTITUTE DEPENDENTS, DEFECTIVES, AND DELINQUENTS

The very young and the very aged come within this group. Both are peculiarly dependent upon
others, though the aged may, by thrift in earlier years, have acquired a competence with which
to meet the needs of old age; and the young are expected, in later years, to compensate the
community for the care they have received from others during childhood.

There are those, also, of all ages, who are incapacitated for self-support and for service
by disease, or by physical or mental defects such as bodily deformities, blindness, or feeble-
mindedness. In addition, there are some who, though physically able to perform service, deliberately
prey upon the community in one manner or another without giving anything in return. The latter
constitute the DELINQUENT class, and include criminals.

RELATION OF THE FAMILY TO THE PROBLEM

Normally, the needs of those who are unable to support themselves, whether because of extreme
youth or old age or because of physical or mental defects, are provided for by the family.
It frequently happens, however, that the family is unable to perform this service. It may be
entirely broken up. Children may be left without parents, and the aged without children. The
natural supporters of the family may be stricken by disease, or by accident, or by financial
misfortune. Moreover, the proper care and treatment of many defectives require better facilities
and greater skill than can be provided even by well-to-do families. Thus a class of DEPENDENTS
is produced--dependents upon the community as a whole. They may or may not be DEFECTIVES, physical
or mental. Dissipation and thriftlessness are two of the chief causes of dependency.

TREATMENT IN EARLY TIMES

In the lower stages of civilization it was not uncommon for the feeble and the helpless to
be put to death, even sickly children and persons infirm from old age. This was done in the
name of community interest. The struggle for existence was so severe that the presence of non-producing
or non-fighting members endangered the entire group. Besides, it was the belief in most cases
that the sacrifice of the helpless simply hastened their passage into a happier life.

REDUCING THE WASTAGE OF HUMAN LIFE

Humane considerations now prevent such treatment of the helpless. Moreover, with our increased
skill in medicine and surgery and education, the diseased and defective may often be restored
to health or fitted for some form of self-support that makes them happier and of use to the
community. The wastage of human life has been greatly reduced in recent years. Many of the
soldiers who returned from the war in Europe so broken in body or mind that in former times
they would have dragged out the remainder of their lives a burden to themselves and to others
have, by surgical skill and special forms of education, been restored wholly or partially to
the ranks of the self-supporting and useful members of the community. This REHABILITATION of
the dependent and defective members of the community, whether their misfortune is due to war
or other causes, is the chief aim of the treatment given them by the community at the present time.

RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH COMMUNITY

It is an accepted principle that each community should, so far as possible, care for its own
unfortunates, and the effectiveness with which it is done varies. But everywhere it has taken
a long time to change from the old policy of mere RELIEF to the new policy of REHABILITATION
(see above).

THE LOCAL ALMSHOUSE AND ITS DEFECTS

In New England and in a few other states the town, or township, is the unit for administering
"poor relief," but elsewhere it is the county. The "almshouse," or "poor farm," or "county
infirmary" is the usual local institution for this purpose. Unfortunately it has been, as a
rule, badly managed. Men and women, old people and children, healthy and diseased, blind and
crippled, moral and immoral, even the insane, have been housed together, often mingling with
one another with little restriction. The evils of such a system are apparent.

SHORT-SIGHTED POLICY

Moreover, the policy of the typical almshouse has been merely to give shelter and food and
clothing to those who appeal for it, rather than to remedy the causes of dependency or to restore
the unfortunate to a basis of self-support and usefulness. Medical treatment is of course given,
but the means do not exist to give special expert treatment to particular classes of defectives.
Little educational opportunity worthy of the name is afforded. While able-bodied inmates usually
have some work to do, it is seldom of a character to train for self-support or to create habits
of industry.

REMEDIES PROPOSED

To provide this special treatment requires elaborate equipment and expert service, which cost
a great deal of money, more than most counties or towns feel that they can afford. Communities
must come to realize that they cannot afford to neglect their unfortunate members, no matter
what it costs to care for them. But the cost need not be so great as it seems. A great deal
of money is now WASTED on almshouses without adequate results. This can largely be remedied
by insisting upon more expert supervision in such institutions, and by a system of regular
inspection by expert state officers. Greater care should be exercised with respect to those
who are admitted to the institutions. Only the deserving should be allowed to live on the public
funds. It is not uncommon for some classes of shiftless people to make a practice of seeking
shelter in the almshouse during the winter, where they live in comparative comfort and idleness
at the public expense, only to leave in the spring for a life of aimless indolence, imposing
as beggars upon kind-hearted people.

PURPOSE OF STATE INSTITUTIONS

Moreover, the county almshouse should be only a temporary place of detention for many of the
people who now are kept there permanently. Those who need special treatment or training should
be passed on as quickly as possible to special institutions that are equipped to care for them.
Since most local communities could not well afford to maintain such special institutions for
the comparatively few who would need them, the state should maintain enough of them at central
points to provide for the needs of all local communities.

The states do maintain such institutions--hospitals and sanitariums for various types of mental
disease, homes for orphans and for the aged, and for persons with incurable diseases, asylums
and schools for the blind and the deaf-and-dumb, industrial schools for boys and girls. The
problem of the state is, first, to develop such institutions to the highest possible degree
of efficiency for the REHABILITATION of their patients or inmates, and, second, to secure effective
cooperation on the part of local authorities and institutions in transferring those, and only
those, who are entitled to state assistance.

COOPERATION FOR "OUTDOOR" RELIEF

When dependents are cared for in institutions, it is called INDOOR RELIEF; when they are cared
for outside of institutions, in their homes, it is called OUTDOOR RELIEF. Outdoor relief requires
community organization and cooperation and expert leadership quite as much as indoor relief.
The lack of these has often resulted in great harm both to the community and to the needy person.
Promiscuous giving of charity by well-intentioned persons often results in giving to the undeserving
as well as to the deserving. There are lazy and shiftless individuals who find it easier to
live on charity than by honest work, and whose lack of self- respect permits them to do so.
Sometimes they do so by fraudulent methods. Giving to such persons encourages pauperism and
fraud instead of curing it. Kind-hearted people often say that they would rather be cheated
occasionally by dishonest applicants for charity than to fail to help the really needy by too
great caution. The answer to this is that by proper community organization and cooperation
the needy will be found with much greater certainty, the fraudulent will be detected, and the
aid given to those who should have it will be much more effective. The citizen who turns an
applicant for aid over to an effective organization in a great majority of cases performs a
much greater service both to the applicant and to the community than by attempting to give
aid directly. A few pennies or a few dollars given even to a worthy applicant may not reach
the root of the trouble at all, and may be the innocent cause of perpetuating the trouble.

VOLUNTARY AGENCIES

Many voluntary organizations exist for charitable and philanthropic purposes. The church has
always been one of the chief agencies to care for the poor and unfortunate; but there are many
others, especially in our large cities. Sometimes they maintain hospitals and other institutions
for the treatment of those who need indoor relief. They have done a great deal of good. But
they are subject to the same difficulties that individuals encounter in dealing wisely with
particular cases. They have often devoted themselves too exclusively to giving temporary relief
instead of seeking to cure causes and to rehabilitate the unfortunate. They are frequently
deceived by impostors. Seldom do they have expert investigators to follow up individual cases
and to prescribe the most effective remedy. They frequently duplicate one another's work in
a wasteful manner.

CHARITY ORGANIZATION

This lack of team work has been in large measure remedied, especially in city communities,
by the establishment of CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETIES. Such societies do not as a rule give
direct relief, but act as a "clearing house" for existing charitable agencies in the community.
That is, they organize the effort of the various existing agencies. They have a corps of trained
investigators who look into each case reported by any individual or charitable agency in the
community, make a careful record of it, and prescribe the proper treatment. The case is usually
turned over to one of the existing agencies that is properly equipped to handle it. Philanthropic
persons may turn to the charity organization society for advice as to purposes for which money
is most needed. The aim of charity organization is to remedy causes of dependency and to restore
dependents to a self- sustaining basis so far as that is possible.

GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION FOR POOR RELIEF

Charity organization societies are wholly voluntary organizations; and there is need for such
voluntary cooperation to care for the community's unfortunate and to root out the causes of
dependency. Such organizations should, however, work in cooperation with governmental agencies.
There are state boards of charities which usually have supervision over the various state institutions
for dependents and defectives. Every large city government has its department of charities,
sometimes combined with the department of health. The "overseer of the poor" is one of the
oldest of town officers. The care of dependents and defectives in small, or rural, communities
has, however, been very poorly organized.

RELATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL ORGANIZATION

An effective attack upon the public welfare problems of a state is twofold: (1) by a state
welfare board and state welfare institutions, and (2) by town and county welfare boards and
institutions... .

Public welfare work calls for a state board of public welfare, statewide in authority ... and
for state institutions that are large enough to care for the delinquents, the dependents, the
defectives, and the neglected who cannot be better cared for by local authority and institutions.
...

But, on the other hand, it calls for county boards of public welfare with county-wide authority
and trained executive secretaries. ... Many of our ills bulk up so big that they can be successfully
attacked only in detail by local interest, local effort, and local institutions. Tuberculosis
and poverty are capital instances of social problems that are beyond the possibilities of state
institutions, and that necessarily wait upon organized county efforts of effective sort. ...
We do not know the deaf, the blind, the feeble-minded, the epileptic, the crippled, and the
neglected or wayward boys and girls--their number, their names, and their residences in any
county of the state ... because there is at present no local organization charged with the
responsibility of accounting for such unfortunates. ...

Club YEAR BOOK, 1917-1918, pp. 161, 162 (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N. C.).]

CAUSES OF DEPENDENCY MUST BE REMOVED

There will doubtless always be some dependent and defective members of the community for whom
the community must care. Their number, however, may be greatly reduced by creating conditions
that will remove their causes. It has been reported from many localities, for example, that
the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors has resulted in the emptying of the "work
houses" which communities have sustained for the confinement of vagrants and persons convicted
of petty misdemeanors. Much dependency has resulted from the crippling of wage earners by industrial
accidents and from "industrial diseases" arising from work in unwholesome conditions. These
causes may be removed by the maintenance of wholesome working conditions, by the installation
of safety devices, and by the exercise of greater care by workers and employers. The "safety
first" movement strikes at the root of much dependency. Inability to read signs and to understand
instructions on the part of illiterate and foreign workers is the cause of many accidents.

SOCIAL INSURANCE

Some states have passed "employers' liability laws," designed to hold employers responsible
for accidents resulting from failure to provide safe working conditions. Others have "workmen's
compensation laws" which provide that an injured workman shall receive a portion of his wages
during incapacity from accident or illness. In some countries various forms of COMPULSORY STATE
INSURANCE have been adopted. Germany, for example, has long had laws requiring employees to
take out accident insurance and insurance against sickness, both employees and employers contributing
to the insurance fund. Pensions for the aged and for widows are also provided for, the government
itself contributing to the fund for this purpose. At the close of the year 1919, 39 of our
48 states had laws providing for aid by the state to mothers who were unable to provide properly
for their children.

The aim in our community life should be as far as possible to PREVENT dependency and not merely
to relieve suffering after it occurs. We shall find that the problem will tend to disappear
in proportion as we develop in our communities adequate provision for health protection and
physical development (Chapter XX), for vocational and general education (Chapter XIX), for
wholesome recreation (Chapter XXI), for the cultivation of habits of thrift (Chapter XIII);
and as we are successful in producing a right attitude toward the problem of earning a living
and wholesome relations between employer and employee (Chapter XI).

THE CRIMINAL CLASS

It is said that there are at least 250,000 people in the United States who make their living
by crime, and there are many more who commit crime on occasion. It is said, also, that to support
and control this criminal class costs the people of the United States not less than $600,000,000
per annum, or as much as is expended for the entire educational system of the country.

WHAT CRIME IS

Crime is the violation of law. The criminal is a member of the community who refuses to cooperate
with others in accordance with the law. The conduct of an individual may be wrong and harmful
to the community without being criminal; it becomes criminal only when the law actually forbids
it. A given act may be a crime in one state and not in another state, because the laws of the
states differ in their definition of crimes. They also differ in the penalties imposed for
the same crime.

EARLY METHODS OF TREATING CRIMINALS

The methods of dealing with criminals have changed greatly with the progress of civilization,
and especially in recent years since the causes of crime have become better understood. In
the earlier methods two ideas were prominent: the infliction of punishment, and the deterrence
of others from committing the same offense. The penalties inflicted were therefore very severe.
The death penalty was inflicted not only for taking human life but also for minor offenses,
such as stealing. Even in our own country in colonial times bodily mutilation was not uncommon,
such as branding with a hot iron, or cutting off the ears. Prisons were vile and loathsome places.

REHABILITATION OF CRIMINALS

Humane feelings have caused the abandonment of such treatment. The death penalty still remains
for the worst of crimes; but even it has become more humane in its methods. Many believe that
it should be entirely abandoned. Moreover, a new idea has entered into the matter. It is the
same idea that controls the modern treatment of dependents, namely, that of REHABILITATING
the criminal. It is now recognized that crime results in most cases from diseased conditions
either in the individual or in the community. Some individuals commit crime merely because
it seems to them the easiest way to make a living or to gain some other end; but even such
individuals are MORALLY diseased. Much crime is due to temporary mental disturbance, as from
the use of intoxicants or other drugs. Sometimes it is the act of persons who are actually
insane or feeble-minded. Very often it is committed under pressure of poverty.

In view of these facts, while the deliberate violator of law should doubtless be punished,
it is even more important that the causes of crime should be removed, and that the criminal
should, in as many cases as possible, be restored to a useful and an honest manner of life.
The proper treatment of dependents and defectives, and the removal of causes of dependency
and defectiveness, are essential steps toward the lessening of crime.

THE LOCAL JAIL

The county jail and the town "lock-up" are the usual local institutions where persons suspected
of having violated the law are detained while awaiting trial in the courts, and also where
those convicted of petty misdemeanors are imprisoned for punishment. The jail and the "lock-up"
are as notorious as the almshouse for unwholesome conditions and mismanagement, though conditions
have greatly improved under the influence of an awakened public opinion. They have often, been
unsanitary in the extreme. Prisoners have often been treated more like cattle than like human
beings. Young and old are thrown together, the hardened criminal with the youthful "first offender,"
and with those merely suspected of crime, many of whom will be proved to be innocent. The result
is demoralizing. Our jails have sometimes been said to be "schools of vice and crime."

NEEDED REFORM OF THE JAIL

Two reforms, at least, are needed in local jails. First, they should be made as wholesome as
possible, both physically and morally. They should be perfectly sanitary, and the food should
at least be clean and nourishing. Arrangements should be made to keep the different classes
of inmates separate, especially the hardened and vicious criminals from youthful transgressors
and suspects. In the second place, the local jail should be merely a place of detention for
those awaiting trial or, after trial, transfer to other institutions. Those found guilty by
the courts should be transferred as quickly as possible to institutions where they may receive
treatment fitted to their needs.

FITTING THE TREATMENT TO THE OFFENDER

Of three persons who steal ten dollars, one may be a deliberate thief who prefers to make his
living this way; another may be driven by hunger; and the third may be mentally unbalanced.
It is obvious that the treatment accorded to each should be determined by these facts rather
than by the mere amount of the theft. The first doubtless needs punishment; but he should also
have treatment designed to change his attitude toward the community and to fit him to make
an honest living. The second needs to be relieved of his want and to be given an opportunity
for self- support. The third needs hospital treatment. We are only beginning to see that punishment
is only a part of the treatment necessary, and that the treatment should be made to fit the
criminal fully as much as to fit the crime.

STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR DELINQUENTS

Proper treatment for all the various classes of cases cannot well be given in the county jail;
nor can the local community as a rule afford to maintain separate institutions for them, as
the number in each class is very small in a given community. Hence the necessity for state
institutions to which those convicted in the local courts may be sent. Such institutions exist,
although not always adequate to the needs of the state. They include state penitentiaries,
reform and industrial schools, hospitals for the insane, special schools for the feeble-minded,
and others. These institutions have been steadily improving in their efficiency. The greater
difficulty seems to be in the local communities, in securing the assignment of offenders to
the proper institutions.

ADMINISTRATION OF STATE PRISONS

Great changes have occurred in recent years in the methods of administering state penitentiaries,
especially in some states. Under old conditions convicts were either confined in isolation
and idleness or condemned to hard labor, punishment being the sole idea in both cases. The
most rigid and arbitrary discipline was enforced. Modern penitentiaries keep prisoners employed
in occupations that are of use to the state, that are designed to train the prisoner for useful
service, and that yield him some compensation that will help to make him self-supporting when
he leaves. They also maintain schools for the instruction of prisoners in at least the common
branches of knowledge and in vocational subjects. Great care is taken of the health. In some
cases the prisoners are graded according to their conduct and their ability to assume responsibility,
certain privileges and freedom and participation in the administration of the prison being
bestowed upon them so long as they show a sense of their responsibility. The period of imprisonment
may be shortened as a reward for good conduct.

JUVENILE OFFENDERS

One of the most important reforms that have been made is that in the treatment of juvenile
offenders. The main feature of this is the establishment of a JUVENILE COURT, where the usual
procedure and publicity of a criminal court are avoided, and where the judge takes a fatherly
attitude toward the accused. Each case is carefully investigated to discover the cause of trouble
and to arrive at a wise conclusion as to the treatment to be given. In the case of first offenders,
or where other conditions justify it, the prisoner is released ON PROBATION. That is, he is
given his freedom on his honor, but under the supervision of a PROBATION OFFICER to whom he
must report at regular intervals. In the case of more serious offenses, or of repeated wrong-doing,
or of violation of parole, offenders are sent to reform schools or industrial schools. The
entire effort is to set the young offender on the right road to honest self-support and good
citizenship. Unfortunately, however, this machinery for the treatment of juvenile delinquency
is so far found almost exclusively in cities. The problem of juvenile delinquency in rural
communities is one that requires more attention than has been given to it. It is a problem
that the young citizen himself can greatly help to solve by the cultivation, in himself and
in his friends, of right conceptions of citizenship.

CHAPTER XXIII

TEAM WORK IN TAXATION

THE DISLIKE OF THE PEOPLE FOR TAXATION

People have never liked to pay taxes. Their repugnance to it is largely a survival of the times
when an autocratic ruling class imposed taxes upon the people for its own selfish purposes.
Struggling for the bare necessities of life, the people had to pay the bills of the ruling
class who lived in luxury. The long struggle for liberty in England and in the English colonies
was a struggle against the power of rulers to impose taxes without the consent of the people.
The habit of mind with respect to taxation formed under such conditions has to a considerable
extent persisted into the present, when conditions are very different.

WHAT TAXATION MEANS IN A DEMOCRACY

The change to government "of the people, by the people, for the people" should put the paying
of taxes in a very different light. We decide upon a service we want performed for us, we provide
the governing machinery to perform the service, and the service must be paid for. We do not
object to paying for having our house built, our food provided, our clothes made, and our goods
hauled. Why should we object to paying for the service of schools, roads, protection of health
and property, the defense of our liberties?

THE RETURNS FROM TAXATION

Such objection seems especially unreasonable when we consider that the value of the service
rendered by government is, as a rule, far in excess of what it costs the individual citizen.
In Chapter XVII we saw that a Virginia farmer, the value of whose farm was assessed at $3000,
was taxed $19.48 for road improvements. In return for this he acquired the use of a system
of roads throughout the county that cost at least $173,000. This local system connected him
with the transportation system of the entire country, gave him a market for his produce, greatly
increased the value of his land, brought better school facilities, and enriched his life in
many ways.

The recent war imposed an unusually heavy burden of taxation upon us. But when we think of
the millions of people who paid for the war with their LIVES, and of the fact that the war
was fought for the most precious of all things,--human liberty,--the money tax that each citizen
had to pay in some form or other seems very insignificant.

BENEFITS OF TEAM WORK IN TAXATION

In Chapter IV we read how Benjamin Franklin secured the services of a man to keep the pavements
of the neighborhood clean "for the sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house." By
this bit of cooperation, each householder was relieved of a burden, and had the benefit not
only of having his own pavement cleaned, but also of knowing that those of all his neighbors
would be equally clean, and thus of having a pleasanter neighborhood, and the cost was insignificant.
This incident illustrates the underlying principle of taxation in a self-governing community.
The poorest citizen is made rich in the benefits that he may enjoy, while the cost is made
proportional to his ability to pay.

MISUSE OF TAXES

Like the rest of our governing machinery, however, our system of levying, collecting, and paying
taxes does not always work perfectly, and there is more or less ground for dissatisfaction
with it. In the first place, the people do not always get full value for their taxes. While
it is true that the farmer receives, in return for his road tax, vastly more than he could
purchase privately with the same amount of money, yet, if the road improvements are poorly
made, he gets less than he should. It usually costs as much to employ an inefficient road supervisor,
or school teacher or superintendent, or sheriff, as to employ an efficient one--in fact, in
the long run it costs more. Sometimes more persons are employed in government offices than
there is any need for, or some of those employed are shirkers, or otherwise inefficient. There
is wastefulness in the methods by which appropriations are made for the expenses of government.
Sometimes there is "graft," by which public money is diverted to the private uses of officials,
contractors, or others.

A CAUSE OF DISSATISFACTION

Such abuses as these are, of course, not faults of the TAXING system, but they naturally make
citizens reluctant to pay taxes. People want to know that their money is spent for the purposes
for which it was paid, and that it is used economically and effectively for these purposes.
Nothing else will do so much to remove the dislike of taxation as assurance on these points.

TAXATION MUST BE JUST

A system of taxation must be JUST if it is to meet with popular approval. It is not easy, nor
indeed possible, to devise a system that works with absolute justice in every case; for the
assessment of taxes is a complicated process, and reliance must be placed to a considerable
extent upon the honesty and conscientiousness of individual citizens. The people are satisfied,
however, if they see that every reasonable effort is made to secure justice.

The first essential in a just system is that EVERY CITIZEN SHALL BEAR HIS SHARE of the burden.
Therefore the paying of taxes is compulsory by law. It is also just that each citizen shall
pay only IN PROPORTION TO HIS ABILITY. These two principles of taxation are similar to those
applied in the selective draft for war service. It is in assessing taxes according to ability
to pay that one of the principal difficulties appears. But an effort has been made to do this
by the following procedure.

HOW THE AMOUNT TO BE RAISED IS DETERMINED

It is first necessary to know how much money will be needed by the government. Each year, therefore,
the heads of the various branches and departments of government make an estimate for the coming
year, based on their knowledge of past expenditures and present and future needs. Such estimate
can be made intelligently only when there is an accurate and businesslike system of keeping
accounts and records, and a well-planned BUDGET SYSTEM. Unbusinesslike methods of keeping accounts
and the lack of a budget system have been among the chief weaknesses of our governments, equally
characteristic of local, state, and national governments. Efforts are being made to remedy
these defects and are described in Chapters XXV, XXVI, and XXVII.

TAXES ON PERSONS, PROPERTY, AND PRIVILEGES

The second thing to be ascertained is the ability of each citizen to pay. In some states a
uniform POLL TAX is assessed upon every adult citizen. This is a tax upon the PERSON and usually
amounts to about two dollars. Only those are exempt who are incapable of self-support. But
the chief reliance is upon a property tax. State and local governments depend principally upon
a GENERAL PROPERTY TAX, for which purpose property is divided into two kinds: REAL ESTATE,
which includes land and buildings, and PERSONAL PROPERTY, which includes furniture, tools,
livestock, money, and valuables of various kinds. In addition to the general property tax there
may be taxes upon INCOMES and upon INHERITANCES. There are also LICENSE TAXES, such as dog
and automobile licenses. Finally there are taxes upon certain PRIVILEGES which are bestowed
upon the individual by the community and have a money value. Of such a nature is the license
tax imposed upon a peddler or upon a person who maintains a market stand on the public street.
Such, also, are the taxes placed upon corporations for the privilege of using the public highways
for car tracks, water mains, or telephone poles.

It is necessary, therefore, for the government to ASSESS THE VALUE of the property (or privilege)
of each citizen, and it has its organization for this purpose. Each local community The assessment
of (township, county, or city) has one or more TAX ASESSORS, who endeavor to ascertain by inquiry
values or inspection the value of each citizen's property. The sum of the individual assessments
constitutes the assessment valuation for the town, or county, or city; and the sum of the valuations
of these local communities constitutes the valuation for the entire state.

THE RATE OF TAXATION

The third step is to ascertain the RATE of taxation. This is found by dividing the total amount
to be raised by taxation The rate of by the total property valuation of the county or taxation
state, as the case may be. If the amount to be raised is $500,000, and the property valuation
is $10,000,000, the rate would be 5 per cent, and the tax is levied against each citizen at
this rate. A citizen who owns twice as much property as another should pay twice as much tax.
Each should pay according to his ability.

DIFFICULTY OF JUST ASSESSMENT

This seems like a simple procedure; but it is very difficult to get a just result. The difficulty
lies chiefly in the assessment It requires a good deal of intelligence to assess property fairly,
even with the best of intentions. Assessors are not always competent. Two assessors may differ
in their judgment, so that assessments in one part of the community may run at a lower level
than in another part. Thus assessments vary in their fairness in different townships of the
same county, and in different counties of the same state. An attempt is made to avoid this
by means of county and state TAX EQUALIZATION BOARDS, which seek to adjust differences of this
sort. But their efforts are only partially successful.

RESPONSIBILITY OF PROPERTY OWNERS

Property owners are themselves, however, more responsible than anyone else for the inequities
of taxation in our country. It is a common practice of tax assessors to accept the property
owner's own statement of the valuation of his property. In an astonishingly large proportion
of cases he gives a valuation far below the real one. Even when the assessor inspects the property,
it is easy to conceal from his eyes certain forms of personal property, such as money, stocks
and bonds, and jewelry. Land and livestock cannot be concealed; and for this reason farmers
are likely to pay a heavier share of taxes than others whose property is in less conspicuous
forms. But they may make false valuations.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF UNJUST ASSESSMENTS

In one state, where the law requires the assessment of real estate "at its true value in money
when sold in the ordinary manner of sale," a study in one township showed that "the average
TAX value of farm land in the open country ... is $7.89, while the average MARKET value runs
around $20. The 73 largest taxpayers give in their farm holdings at values ranging from $6
to $20 an acre. Thus the burden of state and county support falls three or four times as heavily
on one acre of farm land as on another--on farms lying side by side.

"When we look at suburban farm land the tax values range from $17 to $2220 an acre.

"But the most amazing 'jokes' appear in the values put by their owners on improved town lots.
In the same end of the town we found three handsome town properties worth around $15,000 each,
the tax values were $550, $4400, $4950. In another neighborhood, two adjoining homes about
equal in value were listed at $500 and $3400; one at about 50 per cent and the other at about
8 per cent of the actual value."

With regard to personal property in the same township, the wealthiest private taxpayer in the
township lists household goods and utensils, work-stock, vehicles, money, jewelry ... at $216.
The next wealthiest private taxpayer covers all these properties with $105. He's a farmer and
well-to-do, but his household furniture, farm animals, vehicles, implements, and the like,
are worth only $105--on the tax list.

"Another large landowner covers his household goods, farm animals, vehicles, and the like,
with $82; another with $457, and another with $2272. One of the strange things about it is
that citizens evade taxation who would not think of being dishonest or unfair in a private
business transaction. The reason is not easy to understand. Doubtless it is partly due to the
feeling that as long as "everybody does it" it is justifiable. Of course this is not true.
One taxpayer is reported as saying, "I feel dog-mean whenever I give in my taxes; but I'm doing
as well as the rest and a little better than most."

GOOD SENSE AND GOOD BUSINESS

Dishonest returns by one taxpayer defraud the citizen who is honest, because they place a heavier
burden of taxation upon the latter. Moreover, the dishonest taxpayer and good cheats himself
along with others, for the lower the business valuation of property, the higher the rate of
taxation, or the poorer the service received from the government. "It is good sense and good
business for a state to show up with large tax values and low tax rates. It shows a brisk and
lively prosperity that is attractive to outside capital and enterprise." [Footnote: E. C. Branson,
A Township Tax-List Study]

INTELLIGENCE AND PUBLICITY NEEDED

To secure fairer taxation and better returns from taxation there is need of improvement in
the organization for tax assessment and tax equalization. It is especially important to make
it more difficult for the "tax dodger" to evade his responsibility. It would seem, however,
that there would be fewer "tax dodgers" if the people once got "the right idea" of what taxation
really means in a democracy. Great improvement would doubtless result, even under present conditions,
if honest citizens would take more interest in the results of assessments as shown in the tax
lists. The writer quoted in the paragraphs above asserts that, next to the Bible, "the most
important book in any county is the Tax List, and it is the one book that the people in general
know least about."

Everybody knows in a vague, general way that something is wrong with our tax system ... but
what everybody does not know is what the facts are in concrete, accurate detail. There is no
cure like publicity for wrongs in a democracy. Give the folks the facts, whatever they are,
and the folks will do the rest. ... But at present nobody knows the facts. That is to say,
nobody but the tax listers, the registers, and the sheriffs. And they are dumb because their
official lives depend on silence. [Footnote:. C. Branson, A Township Tax-List Study.]

TAXATION BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT

We have been speaking so far of taxation, for the purposes of state and local governments.
(Constitution, Art. I, sec. 8, clause i). State and local governments raise most of their revenues
by DIRECT taxation upon the property of citizens. The national government, on the other hand,
has always relied chiefly upon INDIRECT taxation. Congress levies DUTIES ON IMPORTS. These
duties are paid in the first instance by the importer. The latter, however, adds the tax to
the price of the goods, so that it is paid finally by the consumers and not by the importer.
In a similar manner Congress levies EXCISE TAXES, which are taxes upon products manufactured
in this country. The principal excise taxes have been those levied on alcoholic liquors and
tobacco. But here again the tax is paid by the consumer in the price which he pays for the
liquor or tobacco.

ADVANTAGES OF INDIRECT TAXATION

The chief advantage of indirect taxes is the ease and certainty with which they may be collected
by the government. the citizen pays them whenever he buys the articles on which the tax is
levied. The retail dealer passes them on to the wholesaler, and so finally the importer is
reimbursed. The government collects the taxes at customs houses at ports of entry, or at the
tobacco factories and, formerly, at distilleries. Prohibition has deprived the government of
one of its chief sources of revenue. Indirect taxes are also less objectionable to the people,
for they are seldom conscious of paying them when they buy goods upon which they are levied.
It has been found difficult in practice to make such apportionment. Various attempts by Congress
to levy a direct tax on incomes have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court because
it was not so apportioned.

A large revenue is now derived from the national income tax. The law at first exempted from
it single persons whose income was less than $3000, and married persons whose income was less
than $4000. As a result of the war, only those are now exempt whose incomes are less than $1000,
if single, and $2000 if married, with an additional exemption for each dependent child. The
tax is PROGRESSIVE: that is, the larger one's income, the higher RATE one pays.

WAR TAXES

In ordinary times of peace, state and local governments together spend much more money than
the national government. In war time the reverse is true. Enormous sums of money were required
for the conduct of the recent war. As a result the rates of import, excise, and income taxes
were greatly increased, and unusual forms of taxation were adopted. A war tax was placed upon
many articles of common use, an inheritance tax was imposed similar to that in some of the
states, and the EXCESS PROFITS of businesses which the war made unusually prosperous were taxed
heavily. The effort in every case was to distribute the tax so that every one should do his
share, while the burden should rest most heavily upon those who could best bear it.

GOVERNMENT LOANS

A large part of the money necessary for war purposes, and for permanent improvements in time
of peace, is raised by borrowing. Governments, whether national, state, or local, borrow money
by the sale of BONDS, the purchase price with interest being returned to the purchaser after
a stated period of years. The national government borrowed more than 22 billion dollars during
the war by the sale of "liberty bonds," and an additional large sum by the sale of "war savings
stamps". These loans made by the people are ultimately paid off with funds raised by taxation.
The people to- day advance money to the government, which the people of to-morrow pay back
by taxation. This is justifiable because the war was fought for the benefit of future generations
as well as of the people to-day. For the same reason, the cost of permanent improvements, such
as roads and public buildings, is distributed over a period of years.

CHAPTER XXIV

HOW WE GOVERN OURSELVES

Early in our study we considered the question WHY we have government (Chapter IV). We saw then
that it is the people's organization for teamwork in protecting and promoting their common
interests. Succeeding chapters contain evidence that this is so, although they also show that
the results achieved by government are by no means perfect. Now we are to consider HOW we have
organized to get teamwork and how well our organization is suited to its purpose.

GOVERNMENT AS A PROTECTOR OF INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE

"American experience indicates that what men do for themselves, on their own initiative, is
better done than what paternalistic government attempts to do for them." [Footnote: Editorial,
SATURDAY EVENING POST, February 12, 1921.] Americans have always disliked PATERNALISM in government,
which means an attempt on the part of government to control the personal affairs of the people
as a father (Latin, PATER) controls the affairs of a small child. Democracy is founded on faith
in the ability of the people to manage their own affairs with due regard for the equal rights
of other people. We look upon our government chiefly as an instrument to ensure an equal opportunity
to all to exercise initiative and to manage their own affairs; or, to use the terms we have
used before, not so much to do things for us, as to secure teamwork in doing things for ourselves.
We have had numerous examples of this principle in preceding chapters, one of which was the
extent to which private initiative and enterprise were depended upon for the development of
our public lands.

GOVERNMENT AS A PERFORMER OF SERVICE

As our community life has become more complex, and as our dependence upon one another has become
greater, we have gradually come to expect government to do many things for us, and to control
our individual conduct in many ways, that were not thought of at an earlier time. We have had
illustrations of this, also, in foregoing chapters. For example, whereas roads were at first
built and controlled almost entirely by private enterprise, now they are mostly PUBLIC highways,
maintained by state and local governments with the cooperation of the national government.
Proposals to place railroads under government management have always met, and still meet, with
opposition; but government exercises a much greater control over them than formerly. Even education
has only gradually become compulsory by law, and the "public" high school is of recent origin.
Until quite recently the people have been left largely to their own resources for the protection
of health, and for recreation and social life.

VIEWS OF THE SOCIALISTS

There are those who take the extreme position that government should manage practically everything
for us. Such are the Socialists, who believe that the unequal distribution of wealth and the
resulting inequalities in opportunity to satisfy wants are due to the control of industry by
a small and essentially selfish capitalistic class. They believe that all natural resources
and all capital should belong to the people jointly, and that the people's government should
control both the production and the distribution of wealth.

It has been objected to the socialist scheme that, since government would still be in the hands
of imperfect human beings, it would not be wise enough to accomplish the desired result; that
political motives would enter into government management, as they do in government enterprises
to-day, and would prevent the achievement of the desired results; and that, the opportunity
for private initiative and enterprise having been removed, there would be lacking one of the
chief inducements to human progress.

Socialism has made considerable progress in some nations of the world, but it is by no means
popular in the United States, although it has many advocates. We adhere in the main to the
principle that government should do things for us only when they could not be so well done
by private enterprise, and should control our conduct only so far as to secure equality of
personal freedom. The fact remains, however, that an increasing amount of service is being
performed for us by government, and an increasing control exercised by it over private enterprise.

ORGANIZATION FOR SERVICE AND FOR CONTROL

Insofar as government performs service for us, it must have an organization for that purpose,
with competent leadership. And if it is not to interfere unduly with freedom of action or personal
liberty, the people must have an organization by which to maintain control over it. Thus there
must be an organization to ensure efficient SERVICE, and there must be an organization to ensure
democracy, or POPULAR CONTROL. If both organizations are effective, we have an EFFICIENT DEMOCRACY,
toward which we have been striving through all our history, but which we have not yet completely
attained.

A government may be efficient in performing service for the people without being democratic.
In fact, it may be easier to get efficient service under an autocratic government. Germany
before the war illustrated this. But we believe that a government may be both efficient and
democratic. This depends upon competent leadership and popular control; and both of these depend
upon education (Chapter XIX).

In the remaining pages of this book we shall consider both the organization of our government
for service and that for popular control. In this chapter we shall examine some of the methods
by which we seek to control government, or to be SELF-governing.

DIRECT SELF-GOVERNMENT

The people of a community may govern themselves by direct action or indirectly through representatives,
just as a group of farmers may build their own schoolhouse or church, or employ someone to
do it for them. When English colonists settled New England, geographical conditions and other
reasons led them to form small, compact communities, in which it was easy to assemble frequently
at the meetinghouse to discuss matters of community concern and to agree upon, rules, or laws,
to regulate them. This local government by "town meeting" has persisted in many New England
"towns," or "townships," to the present day.

REPRESENTATIVE SELF-GOVERNMENT

This direct action of the people in the New England town is for the purpose of MAKING the laws
only. When it comes to the enforcement of these laws, it is necessary to delegate the authority
to someone. The town meeting could make a law against permitting hogs to run at large, but
it chose someone, a "hog reeve," to see that the law was observed. When the community is large
it is found more convenient to choose representatives also to make the laws. Thus each Massachusetts
town had its representative in the lawmaking assembly of the colony as a whole. This representative
system of government now prevails in our cities, counties, states, and nation.

DIRECT SELF-GOVERNMENT THROUGH CONSTITUTIONS

Even in the larger communities, however, such as cities, states, and the nation itself, the
people have sought to retain more or less direct control over lawmaking. In the first place,
the "fundamental law" of the states and nation found in their constitutions, which determine
what the form and powers of government shall be, has been adopted by more direct action of
the people than most other laws. The Preamble to the federal Constitution asserts that "We,
the people of the United States...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
States of America." Neither state nor national constitutions can be altered except by special
action by the people themselves, either by direct vote at the polls or by conventions of representatives
chosen especially for the purpose.

DIRECT LAWMAKING: INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM

It has long been the practice in many communities to submit important local questions to popular
vote for decision, such as the question of issuing bonds for public improvements, or of licensing
saloons. Within recent years in a number of states the people have gained direct control over
lawmaking in regard to any subject whatever, both in local and state affairs, by means of the
"initiative and referendum." The "initiative" is the right of the voters themselves to "initiate,"
or propose, legislation. This is done by means of a petition signed by a specified number of
voters. The legislature may then act upon the proposed law; but if it does not do so, the law
is submitted to the people for their vote at the next election. On the other hand, if the legislature
passes a law that is objectionable to some of the voters a petition signed by a specified number
of voters requires the law to be REFERRED to the people for their approval or rejection. This
is the "referendum."

DEMOCRACY OF THE WEST

Of the 21 states that had adopted the initiative and referendum (to 1917) only four were east
of the Mississippi River (Maine, Maryland, Michigan, and Ohio). [Footnote: "The Initiative
and Referendum," Bulletin No. 6, submitted to the Constitutional Convention of Massachusetts
(1917) by the Commission to Compile Information and Data, p. 10.] The movement to increase
popular control over government has always been stronger in the West, as we shall see in other
connections.

For the most part, however, our laws are made by our representatives, over whom we exercise
more or less control. Some of the more important means by which this control is exercised are
described in following chapters; but first of all we exercise control by CHOOSING our representatives
at frequent intervals. Let us inquire to what extent the people have a voice in this choice.

THE SUFFRAGE

It is not true that all citizens have a voice in choosing their representatives, though it
is more nearly true today than ever before. The right to a voice in this choice is called the
SUFFRAGE. It is bestowed only on those citizens who possess certain qualifications. The constitution
of each state fixes the qualifications for those who live within the boundaries of the state,
the national government having exercised no control over the matter except in two cases.

EARLY DISTRUST OF THE PEOPLE

The founders of our nation were far from democratic as we now understand the term. They believed
that the government should be controlled by the educated and propertied class, which was small.
The lack of confidence in the people was shown in various ways, but among others by the restriction
of the suffrage. This was true even in the New England town meeting, which we are in the habit
of considering as the most democratic of institutions. For instance, no one could vote in colonial
times who did not belong to the church. Religious qualifications were soon abolished however,
and property qualifications have almost completely disappeared, though in some states voters
must be taxpayers.

QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE SUFFRAGE

Today no citizen may vote in any state who has not reached the age of 21. The reason for this
is clear and just, but it excludes from the suffrage about 30 million young citizens. Persons
of unsound mind are denied the suffrage, and citizens may be disqualified by crime. In some
states illiterates are denied the right to vote. In most states foreigners must have completed
the process of naturalization, which requires five years before they may vote. All states require
residence in the state and in their local districts for specified periods prior to voting.
But with these exceptions, the suffrage is now possessed by practically all male citizens who
are 21 years of age or over, and is rapidly being extended to women on equal terms with the men.

WOMAN SUFFRAGE

There are instances in our early history where women were permitted to vote--in New Jersey,
for example, prior to 1807. In 1869, Wyoming, while still a territory, extended full suffrage
to women, and has been an equal suffrage state since her admission to the Union in 1890. Woman
suffrage has rapidly gained ground in recent years, most rapidly in the West, and at the present
writing (1919) 15 states have granted women equal suffrage with men, all but two of these states
being west of the Mississippi River. The women of Alaska also have this right. In many other
states they have the suffrage at certain elections. Moreover, nearly all of the 36 required
states have ratified the suffrage amendment to the federal Constitution.

MAJORITY AND MINORITY RULE

One of the important principles upon which democratic government rests is that the will of
the majority should control. It is the only arrangement that can be made with justice. It often
happens, however, that a minority, and sometimes a very small minority, gains control. It also
sometimes happens that the party in power in government, whether it is a majority or a minority,
governs without full consideration for the interests of other parties or of the community as
a whole. We shall try to get some idea of how this happens, and also of methods proposed to
prevent it; for as long as it happens we cannot lay claim to a full measure of democracy in
our government.

If the pupils of your class or school are voting on the kind of entertainment to be given,
and a difference of opinion arises, can you think of a fairer way to decide than by a vote
of the majority? How else might the matter be decided?

If the majority decides the question, should the minority yield gracefully to the decision? Why?

After the majority plan has been adopted, have the minority any rights in the matter?

Is the majority always right in its decisions? Give illustrations to prove your answer.

If your community takes a vote on the question of road improvement, or of school consolidation,
is it right that the majority should decide?

If the majority rules in such a case, is it right that the citizens of the minority party should
be taxed for the improvement as well as those of the majority? Why?

If your class president is elected by a majority of the class, or a county supervisor by a
majority of the voters of the county, to what extent is it the duty of this officer to consider
the interests of the minority which voted against him?

POLITICAL PARTIES

Our government is a government by political parties. That is, political parties control the
government. Voters acting independently of one another cannot exercise much influence. There
must be teamwork in political matters as in everything else. A political party consists of
those voters who think alike and act together on questions of government policy, or in electing
their representatives in government. It is a voluntary organization, entirely outside of the
government and not recognized in our constitutions, but exercising very great influence upon
government.

MISCHIEFS OF THE PARTY SPIRIT

As long as people differ on questions of public policy there are bound to be political parties,
as Washington knew, and they have always played an important part in our government. But necessary
and useful as parties have been, the events of our history have shown that Washington's warning
was exceedingly wise, the "party spirit" having often proved the "worst enemy" of our democratic
government.

VALUE OF MINORITY OPPOSITION

When some great question is before the country, like that of the adoption of the Constitution,
or that of slavery, the people are usually divided into two great parties. The party that marshals
the greater number of votes constitutes a majority and gains control of the government. The
defeated minority usually accepts its defeat in a sportsmanlike manner and loyally supports
the government. Nevertheless it does not cease its opposition to the principles of the party
in power. One of the chief values of the party system is that it keeps important questions
in constant discussion. The opposition of the minority serves as a check upon the acts of the
party in power, which is anxious to avoid arousing too much opposition. This is one means of
control over the government enjoyed by the minority party. A defeated minority at one election
may become a victorious majority at the next. The fact that a party is in the minority does
not necessarily mean that it is in the wrong.

HOW MINORITIES MAY GAIN CONTROL

Minorities, however, sometimes win elections. If more than two parties are contesting the election,
which often happens, that one wins which has the greatest number of votes, though this number
may be less than the combined votes of the opposing parties. No other arrangement seems possible.
President Wilson won his first election by a minority vote, the opposition being divided between
Taft and Roosevelt.

A minority may win through better teamwork. There are always some voters who, through indifference
or other causes, do not cast their vote. This is especially likely to happen in local elections,
in which there is almost never as large a vote cast as in the same district at a general election.
It is one of the chief objects of a party organization to keep its members informed and interested
and to see that they cast their votes. The party that is best organized for these purposes
is very likely to win over its opponents even though the latter are more numerous.

ORGANIZATION OF PARTIES AND ITS CONTROL

The organization of the national political parties is very thorough. Each party has a managing
committee in every local district, the local organizations are united in a state organization,
and the several state organizations in a national organization. The shrewdest men the party
affords are made chairmen of committees and chosen for other positions of leadership. Such
organization is necessary and proper; it is only commonsense teamwork. But unfortunately it
has frequently fallen into the hands of designing men who have used it to promote private interests
rather than those of the public. A political "boss," who is at the head of an inner "ring"
of politicians, often decides who shall be nominated for the various offices of government,
leaving no choice to the voters themselves. This makes of our government a real autocracy,
and the worst kind of autocracy, because the autocrat (the "boss") acts in secret, and is in
no way responsible to the people. It is the "frightful despotism" of which Washington warned
his countrymen (p. 385).

CAUSES OF SOCIAL UNREST

Political "bosses" are often allied with powerful business interests which seek legislation
and governmental administration favorable to themselves. This has given rise to the charge
sometimes made that our government is a "plutocracy," a government of the people by a small
wealthy class. It is the feeling that this is so that has caused much of the social unrest
at the present time, and that explains in part the growth of the socialists, and of other groups
that would go much further than the socialists in their proposed changes, such as the I.W.W.
(Independent Workers of the World) in our country, the Bolshevists in Russia, and anarchists
everywhere.

GOVERNMENT IN THE INTEREST OF ALL CLASSES

Unquestionably selfish groups representing great wealth have often exerted undue influence
in governmental affairs without regard for the public welfare. We have seen how the public
lands and the nation's natural resources have in some cases fallen into the hands of wealthy
individuals and corporations to the injury of the nation and of those who want to use them
for productive purposes. On the other hand, it is natural that men who have been successful
in managing their private business affairs should also be influential in managing public affairs
without necessarily having unworthy motives. Nevertheless, when government falls under the
control of ANY particular class or group, whether it represents wealth, or labor, or any other
interest, if it has not due regard for all classes, and if it denies to the members of other
groups the voice in government to which they are entitled, it establishes a despotism and overthrows
democracy.

WHY THE PEOPLE SUBMIT TO "BOSS RULE"

Why do the people submit to "boss rule"? In the first place, they do not always submit to it.
Occasionally, when the "bosses" go to unusual extremes, the people give way to "fits of public
rage," to use the words of former Senator Elihu Root, "in which the people rouse up and tear
down the political leader, first of one party and then of the other party." It is thus possible
for the people to escape the despotism of "boss rule." But two things seem to be necessary
to bring it about: first, the people must be sufficiently INTERESTED in the management of their
public affairs; and, second, they require LEADERSHIP. It takes close attention to public affairs
to enable a citizen to make wise decisions for himself; and the average citizen looks around
for guidance. The absence of RESPONSIBLE leadership gives the irresponsible "boss" his chance.

THE SHORT BALLOT

One difficulty encountered by the citizen who wishes to vote intelligently is the large number
of persons to be chosen. There have been cases where the names of several hundred candidates
appeared on the same ticket. In a small community a voter may know personally all the candidates,
but in larger communities this is not so. It was once thought that to make as many of the government
offices as possible elective was a step in the direction of democracy, and that it gave the
people direct control over them. But it has not worked out this way. It is impossible for the
average voter to choose wisely among so many candidates, and he therefore falls an easy prey
to "boss rule." The SHORT BALLOT is now quite generally advocated to meet this situation. By
this plan the number of officers to be elected is reduced, and includes only those who are
responsible for determining the policies of government, such as members of legislatures and
the chief executive officers. These few important officers and representatives are then made
responsible for the appointment of all other subordinate officers whose business is to carry
policies into effect. This really gives the people better control over their government by
fixing responsibility in a few places, and is therefore no less democratic than the older plan.

Do you have a long ballot or a short ballot in your county or town? In your state?

How many offices in your county government are elective? How many of the men holding these
offices do you know? Consult your parents as to the number of these officers they know personally.
How many does your teacher know?

At the next election, get a copy of the ballot used in your community and ascertain the number
of candidates for all offices, including local, state, and national.

What national political parties exist at present?

Are the voters of your local community divided into parties on local questions? If so, what
are some of these questions?

Investigate the organization in your county (or town) of the political party of which your
father is a member. Who is chairman of its local committee?

Investigate the work that a party organization does in your community during an election campaign;
on election day; in the time between elections.

Why is secret control over government dangerous?

What is meant by "social unrest"?

Are all men of your acquaintance equally capable of directing the affairs Of government in
office? Why?

What is meant by "responsible" and "irresponsible" leadership?

What does it mean to say that a leader must be "responsive as well as responsible" to the people?

THE SECRET BALLOT

Various schemes have been adopted to ensure to every voter a free expression of his choice
for representatives, and to the majority their right to govern. One of these is the SECRET
BALLOT. At the polls each voter enters a booth by himself to mark his ballot, or to operate
the voting machine, and need have no fear that a possible "watcher" may cause him to lose his
job or otherwise suffer for voting as he thinks best. The secret ballot also reduces the likelihood
that votes will be bought, for there is no way of telling whether the man who sells his vote
will vote as he has agreed; and the man who sells his vote is not to be trusted. The only voters
who are embarrassed by the secret ballot are those who cannot read their ballots. These have
to seek help, and are thus open to influence by agents of the "boss."

THE DIRECT PRIMARY

Another device to ensure to the voter a voice in his government is the DIRECT PRIMARY for the
nomination of candidates for office. By the older method candidates were nominated by party
conventions; but under "boss rule" they were in reality determined upon in advance by the "boss,"
the nomination by the convention being largely a matter of form, the delegates voting according
to instructions. The ordinary voter had nothing to say about it. Under the direct primary plan
any voter possessing the necessary qualifications for holding office may become a candidate
by merely securing the signatures of a specified number of voters to a petition. Then a PRIMARY
ELECTION is held at which the voters of each party go to the polls to express their choice
for one among the several candidates who have been announced for each office to be filled.
The candidates receiving the highest number of votes become the nominees of their party. The
direct primary is now used quite widely throughout the United States and is believed to be
a great improvement over the old method, though it does not always work as well as was expected
of it. The truth is that ANY organization is open to abuse by clever people who wish to abuse
it, and NO political organization will work effectively unless the voters are intelligent and
eternally vigilant.

PREFERENTIAL PRIMARIES

The President and Vice President of the United States are still nominated by national party
conventions. But in some states there are PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENTIAL PRIMARIES. These are direct
primaries at which the voters ex press their PREFERENCE for the presidential candidates. This
is intended to be a guide to the nominating convention, but there is nothing to compel the
convention to follow the guidance.

THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES

Democratic government demands certain rights for minorities. We have seen how a minority party
may exercise a wholesome check upon the party in power by constant opposition. We never have
a Congress or a state legislature in which the members are all of one party. This is a good
thing, for it results in discussion and debate in the legislative body by which the people
are kept informed.

The initiative and referendum (p. 380) are also weapons in the hands of a minority; for, as
we have seen, a small number of voters may compel the legislature to consider, or reconsider,
any piece of legislation, or to submit it to the people for their decision. Minority parties
may thus keep prominently before the people measures that have been adversely acted upon by
the majority.

THE RECALL

Another device that has been introduced in some states and local communities is the RECALL
of officials. By means of this a specified number of voters may demand that an officer of government
who is displeasing to them be brought before the people for their vote as to whether he shall
be removed from office or not. A small minority may thus call an elected officer to account.

PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION OF PARTIES

One plan strongly advocated by some students of government to insure to minorities an actual
voice in government is that of PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION of parties in legislative bodies.
By this plan each party would be represented in proportion to its strength. If two parties
were of about equal strength they would be represented equally; if one were twice as strong
as another, it would have twice the representation. The plan is actually in use in very few
localities. In Illinois, however, the CUMULATIVE-VOTE plan is in use, by which each voter is
permitted as many votes as there are places to be filled, and to distribute these votes among
the several candidates or to cast them all for one candidate. Thus, if there are three representatives
to be elected from his district, he may give one vote to each of the three, or he may give
three votes to one of them. A minority may thus, by concentrating all of their votes upon a
single candidate, be reasonably sure of representation. But it requires good team work to get
this result.

DIFFERENT BASES OF REPRESENTATION

Representation in our government is on a TERRITORIAL, OR GEOGRAPHICAL, BASIS. That is, each
representative represents the people in a given territory or district. Thus, in many counties
the board of supervisors is composed of representatives from each township, the members of
state legislatures represent districts of the state, members of the United States House of
Representatives represent congressional districts in each state, and United States Senators
represent states.

In each district under our present system, however, the representatives are ELECTED BY A MAJORITY,
though they are supposed to REPRESENT ALL the people when elected. If proportional representation
were adopted, it would be necessary to increase the number of representatives from each district,
in order that each party should have at least one. Then we should have REPRESENTATION BY PARTIES,
as well as by districts.

We now hear a good deal about SOVIET GOVERNMENT in Russia. The "soviet" is a representative
body with a different basis of representation than either of the above. Soviet government is
government by "workers" and each representative represents a TRADE OR OCCUPATION. It is as
if, in our country, all the farmers in a county, as a group, should elect their representatives
to the board of county supervisors, all the carpenters their representatives, all the merchants
theirs, and so on. It would be, as it is in Russia, REPRESENTATION BY OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS,
instead of by geographical districts as now. It would differ from proportional representation
by parties, as described above, because each political party is made up of representatives
of all occupations. Only in a few cases have political parties in our country tended to become
identified with occupational interests, as in the case of "labor parties," and the old "greenback
party," which was largely made up of farmers.

CHAPTER XXV

OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

When the first colonists of America undertook to organize governments for their local settlements,
they naturally adopted forms with which they had been familiar in England. There were two such
forms which met their needs, the TOWN, OR TOWNSHIP, AND THE COUNTY. These have remained to
this day the chief units of our local government.

THE NEW ENGLAND TOWN

Geographical conditions were such in New England that the colonists settled in compact communities.
There the township, or town, was adopted as the more convenient unit. It included a central
village and the neighboring farming region with irregular boundaries. It is still the unit
of local government throughout rural New England, and in many communities that have grown to
the proportion of cities. It has been said of the New England town government that it is "the
fullest and most perfect example of local self-government either then or now in existence ...
. The state might fall to pieces, and the town would still supply all the wants of everyday
government." [Footnote: Henry Cabot Lodge, A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA,
p. 414.]

THE TOWN MEETING

The chief feature of the New England town government is the TOWN MEETING, which is an assemblage
of the voters of the town at the town hall (formerly often at the church), the regular annual
town meeting being held in the spring or autumn, and special meetings as necessary. These meetings
are called by the SELECTMEN (see below) by means of a WARRANT which contains a statement of
the business to be transacted. At the annual meeting, reports are heard from the officers of
the preceding year, officers for the new year are elected, by-laws (town laws) are enacted,
taxes are levied and appropriations made for the various purposes of government. It is direct
self-government.

NEW ENGLAND TOWN OFFICERS

Among the officers elected by the town meeting are the selectmen, varying in number from three
to nine, who have charge of the town property and are responsible to the town meeting for the
conduct of the town's business; a town clerk, who keeps the town records, issues marriage licenses,
registers births and deaths, and performs other clerical services; an assessor of taxes; a
treasurer; several constables, who have police duties, execute warrants issued by the selectmen
and by the justices of the peace, and sometimes act as tax collectors; school committeemen;
overseers of the poor; members of the board of health and of other boards for public service.
In some of the New England states the justices of the peace, who are not strictly town officers,
are elected by the town meeting.

THE TOWN WARRANT

There is here given a copy of portions of a warrant for a special town meeting. This warrant
is very brief as compared with those issued for a regular annual meeting; but it gives an idea
of the variety of business transacted.

Town Warrant

MIDDLESEX, SS.

To Henry Atchison, one of the constables of the Town of Framingham or to either of them,

GREETING:

It has been said that

THE VALUE OF THE TOWN MEETING

The thing most characteristic of a town meeting is the lively and educating debate; for attendants
on town meeting from year to year become skilled in parliamentary law, and effective in sharp,
quick argument on their feet. Children and others than voters are allowed to be present as
spectators. In every such assembly, four or five men ordinarily do half the talking; but anybody
has a right to make suggestions or propose amendments, and occasionally even a non-voter is
allowed to make a statement; and the debate is often very effective. [Footnote: Albert Bushnell
Hart, ACTUAL GOVERNMENT, p. 171.]

Another writer says,

The retiring officers present their reports, which in the larger towns have been previously
printed and distributed. Any citizen present is free to express any criticism or ask any question.
No better method of checking the conduct of public officers has ever been discovered than this
system of report in open meeting. Keen questions and sharp comment rip open and expose to view
the true inwardness of the officers' behavior.

At its best, the New England town meeting has never been equaled as a mechanism for local government.
No mere representative system can give the opportunity for real participation in government
which a town meeting affords. Even the small boys who come to enjoy the fun from the gallery
are taught that government is a living reality. By grappling first-hand with their own small
local problems, men are trained to take part wisely in the bigger affairs of state and nation.
[Footnote: Thomas H. Reed, FORM AND FUNCTIONS OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, pp. 218, 220.]

WEAKENING OF GOVERNMENT BY TOWN MEETING

Changing conditions, however, have tended to bring about changes in town government. In the
early days the town meeting was a matter of great interest, and everybody attended, including
the women and children. Many of the towns have now acquired large populations, the people are
no longer acquainted with one another, and interest has declined. A few years ago it was reported
that

In Brookline, Mass., with about 2500 votes cast, there are from 300 to 500 at the business
sessions. In Hyde Park, Mass., with 2500 voters... from 500 to 600 attended the annual appropriation
meeting. In Leominster, Mass., with 1400 voting, the normal attendance is about 800.

The same writer says that:

In many places the town meeting is being undermined by the caucus, held beforehand, to nominate
candidates for office. Here a small group of persons not only narrow the choice for officers,
but often arrange the other business to be determined at the town meeting. Sometimes every
thing is "cut and dried" before it comes up for popular discussion; and that discussion thus
becomes a mere formality. [J.A. Fairlie, LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN COUNTIES, TOWNS AND VILLAGES, p. 148.]

INFLUENCES LEADING TO DECLINE

This illustrates what was said in the preceding chapter (p. 388) about the necessity for leadership
and the tendency of the people, under certain conditions, to accept self-appointed leaders,
sometimes not of the best, outside of the government. Conditions in large towns are likely
to favor this. The questions that have to be acted upon are more complicated than formerly,
and often involve the expenditure of large sums of money. The candidates for office are not
known to many of the voters. There may be a considerable number of uneducated people in the
town, and perhaps a foreign population that is unfamiliar with the English language and with
American methods. These things make intelligent self- government by direct methods difficult.

THE FINANCE COMMITTEE: A MEANS OF BETTER SERVICE

Various means have been adopted to meet these changing conditions. One of these is the creation
of a FINANCE COMMITTEE, before which are brought for consideration questions involving the
expenditure of money. This committee holds hearings, at which citizens may present arguments
for and against proposed measures. Thus important matters are sifted out by the committee which
then reports to the town meeting. The town meeting usually votes in accordance with the recommendations
of the committee. While this arrangement tends to secure careful consideration of financial
measures, and to result in wise decisions, provided the committee is composed of reliable men,
it tends, on the other hand, to prevent discussion in open town meeting, to make the vote in
the latter a mere matter of form, and to destroy interest in it. In other words, while it tends
to better SERVICE, it reduces the value of the town meeting as a means of EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRACY.

TOWN PLANNING

Another arrangement that has been adopted in a good many towns is the TOWN PLANNING BOARD.
This is a committee which, after careful study of existing conditions and tendencies of community
growth, formulates a definite PLAN for the promotion of the community's interests during a
period of years. It considers such matters as the laying out of new roads and streets and the
improvement of old ones, the location of parks, playgrounds, and public buildings, the construction
of sewers, water works, and lighting systems, the style of architecture for public buildings,
the enactment of housing laws. While town planning boards usually deal primarily with matters
pertaining to the physical development of the town, they may also plan with reference to the
improvement of the educational system, the promotion of public health, and of social needs
generally.

The town planning board is usually composed of trained men, such as engineers, architects,
and physicians, and it may call in expert advisers from other communities or from the state
government. The advantage of having such a board is that it provides the town with a program
of action carefully worked out from the point of view both of continuous community needs and
of economy. It affords expert leadership.

NEED FOR CITIZEN COOPERATION

As has been said many times in these pages, government is the community's official organization
to secure cooperation; but it is effective only to the extent that the people COOPERATE. It
is a machine that is valuable as the people USE it. The weakening of town, government, or of
any other government, is due largely to a lack of interest and of actual participation by the
people. Many people think they have done their share toward good government when they have
helped elect their officers and have paid their taxes. But when they take this view they are
likely to lose both interest in their government and control over it.

VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION

In many New England towns the decline in popular control of town government has been largely
counterbalanced by COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION FOR VOLUNTARY COOPERATION. Much community service
is, and probably always will be, performed by private enterprise and initiative rather than
by government; and the efficiency of government depends to a considerable extent upon the efficiency
of voluntary enterprise. Government must have the cooperation of the latter, and to some extent
work through it. In practically every community there are groups of people organized to cooperate
for one purpose or another; but they are often self-centered and act independently of one another,
if not actually at cross purposes. The situation that exists in many communities is illustrated
by the chart on page 402. [Footnote: This chart and the one on page 403 are taken from Extension
Bulletin No. 23, Massachusetts Agricultural College, by E.L. Morgan.]

COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN MASSACHUSETTS

In a good many Massachusetts towns this situation has been very largely remedied by means of
community organization for which the leadership has been provided in many cases by the Community
Organization Department of the Extension Service of the State Agricultural College. The organization
varies in detail in different communities to meet local needs, but the main features are the
following:

First: a COMMUNITY COUNCIL, consisting of representatives of the various community interests
and organizations including the town officials. This council serves at first as a sort of "steering
committee" to bring the various interests together and to plan the organization and the work
to be done.

Second: a COMMUNITY MEETING, the first one of which is called by the community council to consider
the questions: Is it possible for a community to plan for its future development? Do we care
to do it? Is it worthwhile? How can it be done? The community meeting becomes a sort of UNOFFICIAL
TOWN MEETING, and is often more largely attended than the official town meeting, partly because
it is attended by the women of the community.

Third: a number of WORKING COMMITTEES, appointed as a result of the first community meeting.
They may include:

A committee on farm production.

A committee on conservation.

A committee on boys' and girls' interests.

A committee on farm business.

A committee on community life (education, health, recreation, etc.)

These committees make a study of the conditions and needs of the community in their respective
fields, and prepare plans and projects, which are submitted to the community meeting in due time.

Fourth: a COMMUNITY PROGRAM, which has been agreed upon by the community meeting, is supervised
by the community council, and is carried out by the various community organizations represented,
including the public officials.

OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL TEAMWORK

This organization is entirely outside of the official govern mental organization. It may be
asked why it is necessary to have a "community meeting" when the official town meeting already
exists. The answer is that the official town meeting has its work pretty definitely cut out
for it. It meets for a half-day or a day at a time, and its time is occupied BY THE VOTERS
in passing laws, electing officials, levying taxes, making appropriations, and doing other
official business. The "community meeting," on the other hand, is attended by non-voters as
well as voters, the women taking an active part, and the young people being represented. Many
matters are discussed that could not properly be taken up in town meeting.

A large part of the program of the community organization is carried out by the voluntary agencies
of the community. But a great many of its proposals must have the approval of the official
town meeting, require appropriations which can only be made by the town meeting, and are finally
executed by the public officials of the town. The organization naturally stimulates interest
in the official government, and brings to its support all the organized agencies of the community
working together.

TOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT OUTSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND

The township is found as a unit of local government in many states outside of New England,
but in most of these cases its government is entirely representative in form. While the town
meeting is found in a few of these states, [Footnote: As in New York and New Jersey; and farther
west in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Illinois, and Nebraska.] it nowhere holds
the important place that it does in New England. One reason for this is the larger size and
more scattered population of the township. In the public land states the congressional township,
six miles square, is also the political township. At the head of the township government in
its representative form are TRUSTEES (sometimes three, sometimes only one) who, with the town
clerk, the constables, the tax assessor, the treasurer, the justices of the peace, and such
other officers as may be required, are elected by the people. The powers of the township government
outside of New England vary in different states, but are always quite limited, relating most
commonly to the maintenance of roads, school administration, and the care of the poor. In these
circumstances there is at least as great need for community organization to support and supplement
the work of government as in the New England towns.

Investigate and report on the following:

The services performed by your township government.

A complete list of your township officers, and the duties of each. (Committees of pupils may
interview some of the more important officers to get a description of their daily routine,
kinds of service performed, etc. Also discuss with parents.)

Officers of the colonial New England town that do not exist now, and their duties.

What is parliamentary law? (Valuable training may be secured by conducting school meetings,
club meetings, or occasional regular class exercises, in accordance with parliamentary procedure.)

Why public discussion is a check upon the conduct of persons holding responsible positions.

The popular interest in public questions in your township.

If there is a finance committee in your township (p. 399), how does it serve the community?
Does it hold hearings? (Attend and report upon some such hearing.)

Town planning in your community (what has been, or what might be, done).

The value of having a plan.

Is your community more like that represented by the chart on page 402, or by that on page 403?

The extent to which voluntary organizations in your community co operate with and through the
local government.

The extent to which your state agricultural college promotes community organization.

The feasibility of organizing your town (or community) by some such plan as that outlined on
page 402.

The value of a community "forum" as a means to good government.

Why the official town meeting should (or should not) be encouraged in your state.

Procure and examine recently published official reports of your township government. What do
these reports tell you? What is the value of such reports? Are the reports of your township
generally read by the people of the township? Why? Discuss ways in which your township reports
could be made more useful.

THE COUNTY

The other unit of local government with which the colonists were familiar was the county, which
in England embraced a number of townships. In the colonies of New York and Pennsylvania the
county and the town ship were developed together as in England; in the southern colonies the
county was organized without the township. Today the county exists in every state of the Union,
including the New England states. In Louisiana it is called the PARISH.

TYPES OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT

There are two main types of county government. According to one plan, as in New York, each
township elects a representative to a county BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, which is sometimes quite
large. According to the other plan, as in Pennsylvania, the people of the county as a whole
elect a small BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, the townships not being represented as such even when
they exist. The board of supervisors or commissioners levies taxes and makes appropriations
for various county purposes, such as constructing and maintaining roads, bridges, and county
buildings, paying the salaries of county officers, caring for the county poor, and conducting
the county schools. It is sometimes spoken of as the county legislative body, but it is rather
an administrative body, its lawmaking powers being very slight.

COUNTY OFFICERS

Among the important county officers are the sheriff, who is chief guardian of the peace in
the county, has charge of the jail, is the chief executive officer of the county court (see
p. 439), and sometimes acts as tax collector; the county prosecutor (also called the prosecuting
attorney, the district attorney, or the state's attorney), who prosecutes all criminal cases
in the county and represents the public authorities in civil suits; the county clerk, who keeps
the county records; the register of deeds, who records all transfers of property; the coroner,
who investigates the cause of violent and mysterious deaths; the tax assessor; the treasurer;
the auditor, who examines the accounts of county officers; the surveyor; the school superintendent;
the health officer. Some times there are others.

LACK OF INTEREST IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT

Although practically every citizen of the United States is also a citizen of a county, the
people have as a rule shown surprisingly little interest in county government. As generally
found it affords a striking example of poor service resulting from a lack of teamwork. County
government has the reputation of being one of the weakest spots in our whole system of government.

WILL COUNTY GOVERNMENT SURVIVE?

We seem to have gotten into the habit of not expecting much service from the county government.
Where the township government is strong, as in New England, it takes the place of county government.
Where people live in cities, they look to the city government to serve them rather than to
the county government. In rural districts the people have come more and more to look to the
state and national governments for such service as they expect government to give. These facts
might suggest the question whether or not we really need county government.

One recent writer says,

There are some parts of the country where I can see that the county will pass out of existence
entirely in a very short time, unless it does adjust itself to the new conditions. [Footnote:
H.S. Gilbertson, in the University of North Carolina RECORD, No. 159, October, 1918, p. 37.]

The same writer says,

Unless the county does measure up in this way, the powers of government and the services which
it renders will have to drift away from local control and be placed in the hands of some government
more fit and which will probably be further away from home.

EFFECTS OF THE LONG BALLOT

Students of county government attribute many of its defects to the "long ballot." In one county
in North Carolina, at a recent election, there were twenty-five different candidates for county
offices on each of three party tickets, making seventy-five candidates among whom each voter
had to choose. Township and state officers were also elected at the same election, bringing
the number of persons to be voted for up to about fifty out of 150 candidates. It is apparent
that the average voter would have difficulty in voting intelligently.

GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A HEAD

The long ballot has other results than the mere difficulty of intelligent voting. One of these
is a GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A HEAD. While the board of supervisors or commissioners is nominally
at the head of the county government, it has to work through the various administrative officers.
These are also elected by the people, and may be of the opposite political party. At all events,
they are independent of the board, not responsible to it, and may or may not work in harmony
with it. A former member of a county board in North Carolina says,

Most persons are under the impression that the board of commissioners, with its chairman, is
at the head of the county government. ... The board does have authority to say how about 19
cents of the entire tax levy may be spent, but its authority over the balance of the levy,
over any county official, such as the sheriff, clerk of the court, coroner, constable, county
judge, or recorder, is nil. The chairman of the board does have the honor ... of smiling and
trying to look pleasant when complaints are made about bad roads, excessive tax assessments,
or the delinquency of some county subordinate, over whom neither he nor the board has any control.[Footnote:
M. S. Willard, North Carolina Club Year Book, 1918, p. 87.]

THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE "BOSS"

Another result of the long ballot is the opportunity it gives the political "boss" to control
the selection of officers. It is not uncommon to hear rural citizens ask such questions as,
"What's the use of farmers taking off time for politics when the whole thing is run by political
bosses anyway?"[Footnote: Graham Taylor, in Rural Manhood, October, 1914, p. 328.] "In such
counties office- seeking has become not the means to the end of performing service, but exists
for the immediate reward, and whatever service is rendered to the people is incidental to that
other object. A faulty system of keeping accounts is as unbusinesslike and disastrous in public
business as in private business.

OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

When I was first connected with the government of my own county, I became very much interested
to know whether we were doing better or worse in the management of our road finances; in the
cost of maintaining our county prisoners; in the maintenance of our county home and numerous
other county institutions, than were other counties. I was anxious to find out what was being
done in other counties in the way of appropriations for hospitals and I selected twelve or
fifteen counties and wrote letters to the county officials asking for information. In answer
to probably two of my letters I received intelligent and satisfactory replies. Probably half
a dozen more gave me some figures which were of very little use for purposes of comparison,
and to my other letters I received no replies, although the first request was followed up by
a second and a third letter. I then began an effort to secure copies of the newspapers in which
had been printed the financial statements of the counties. I succeeded in securing probably
ten statements and, after a fruitless attempt to coordinate these statements so that I might
secure information which would enable me to know whether we were doing better or worse than
our neighbors, I became hopelessly lost in a jungle of statistics and reluctantly gave it up
as useless, and turned my attention to doing what I could to place our own county affairs in
such condition that they could be understood by those of our taxpayers who might be inquisitive
enough to want to know how the money was handled which they paid for taxes. [Footnote: M. S.
Willard, County Finances in North Carolina, in the University of North Carolina RECORD, No.
159, October, 1918, p. 80.]

THE FEE SYSTEM

The practice of compensating county officers from FEES received for special services and of
allowing them to retain the interest on public money is one illustration of extravagant business
methods.

For many of the services performed by county officers fees are charged, on the principle that
the person served should pay for the service. It did not occur to the people to inquire how
much their officers were getting in this way. In one county, in which there was a large city,
investigation showed that the sheriff had a net income from fees and commissions of $15,000,
the county treasurer $23,000, and the county auditor over $50,000.

From the point of view of economy and efficiency it is better to pay all officers an adequate
salary and to require that all fees, commissions, and interest on public money be returned
to the county treasury. It keeps the tax rate down and makes possible an increase of service.

The county office fees and commissions in North Carolina amount to something like one and a
quarter million dollars a year, if they are collected according to law. The total is large
enough to pay all salaries in at least 58 counties of the state, and leave large balances to
apply to schools, roads, jail expenses, interest, and sinking funds. These large surpluses
are being wasted in most of the salary counties.

THE FAULT WITH THE CITIZEN

"But after all," says the county official quoted above, "a great part of the shortcomings of
county officials and a great deal of the looseness which prevails in the management of county
affairs can be charged to the citizen people themselves." Another student of the situation says,

Among the country people themselves there is no demand for better local government or almost
none; they are satisfied or content themselves with grumbling about taxes and in fierce partisan
politics. ... The country people of America lack an adequate sense of civic and social responsibility,
and the deficiency is rising into critical, national importance. [Footnote 2: E.C. Branson,
Report of subcommittee on local government, National Country Life Conference, Baltimore Proceedings,
1919, pp. 68, 69.]

Another says,

The first thing to be reformed in county government is not the officers down at the courthouse,
but our own attitude toward the county, and particularly toward public office. Thomas Jefferson,
living in Virginia where the county was the sole unit of local government, was a great admirer
of the New England town meeting, and said that "public education and the subdivision of the
counties into wards," or townships, were the "two hooks" upon which republican government must
hang. On the other hand, we have observed an opposite tendency to concentrate the administration
of schools, roads, health, and other matters, in the county government (see pp. 294,325). The
fact is that both the organization for centralized, county-wide government, and that for the
government of local communities within the county, have their uses. Neither can do its best
work without the other. The problem is to deter mine what the business of each should be and
to establish a proper balance between them. One thing is sure, namely, that the government
of the county cannot be effective unless the people of the various communities within the county
are organized to cooperate both for their local interests and for the interests of the county
as a whole. This may be provided for in part through township governments, where they exist,
and in part through such unofficial organization as that described for the New England town
(p. 402), or as that furnished by the farm bureau with its local community committees (p. 30).

One of the most progressive states in the matter of county government is North Carolina. One
of the chief instruments by which this progress has been made is the NORTH CAROLINA CLUB, organized
by the University of North Carolina for the study and promotion of the interests of the state.
The North Carolina Club has affiliated with it COUNTY CLUBS, each of which studies its own
county and promotes its interests. In North Carolina they are working in both directions suggested
above: in the direction of an effective central county government, and in the direction of
organization of all local communities for the study of needs and for teamwork in providing
for them. See references.

THE COUNTY AS A SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE

Another important factor in county government is the control exercised over it by the state.
The county is not only a local self-governing unit, but it is also a division of the state
for the administration of state laws. Its powers of self-government are given to it by the
state, and along with these powers it has imposed upon it certain duties for the state. First
of all, the county is a STATE JUDICIAL DISTRICT. The most important building at the county
seat is the courthouse. The COUNTY COURT is one of the state courts described in the next chapter.
The county judge is sometimes chosen by the people of the county, but he is really a state
officer. In New England the county is almost solely a judicial district, and in all states
its judicial purposes are of supreme importance.

But more than this, the county schools are a part of the state school system and must be administered
in accordance with state laws, though by county and township officers. County officers must
enforce the health laws of the state. County authorities not only levy and collect county taxes,
but also collect state taxes from residents of the county.

THE NECESSITY FOR STATE CONTROL

Here again we have an illustration of the necessity for a careful balance between matters properly
subject to local self-government and those properly subject to state control. Counties have
suffered both from too much state control in some respects, and from too little in others.

The whole state is injured ... if one township lets its citizenship deteriorate through ignorance
or drunkenness, and so the state has a right to say that at least six months school term must
be given in every township and that no whiskey-selling shall be permitted. Or if one township
is infested with cattle ticks, other townships are injured, and so the state may set a minimum
standard here ...

It often happens that the citizens of one county pay more than their share of the state taxes
because it has better methods of assessing and collecting taxes and of keeping accounts than
other counties in the state. One of the greatest needs of counties, and one least provided
for, is uniformity among the counties of a state in methods of keeping accounts (see example
on page 410). Some states have established state systems of auditing county finances.

"HOME RULE" FOR COUNTIES

On the other hand, state governments often interfere in matters that might better be left to
local determination. Usually all the counties of a state have exactly the same form of government,
with exactly the same officers who exercise exactly the same duties. Yet some counties within
a state are almost wholly rural, some are almost wholly urban, others are mixed in character.
A form of government adapted to one may not be suited to another. So there has arisen a demand
for a larger degree of "home rule" in counties. In Illinois, counties have had the right to
determine for themselves whether the township should or should not be given prominence in local
government, and whether the "supervisor" or the "commissioner" plan of government should be
used. California now has a law which provides that counties may apply for "charters" in the
same way that cities do in all states. The "charter," like a constitution, determines the form
and powers of the government, and is framed by the people of the county themselves, though
it must then have the approval of the state legislature.

THE GROWTH OF URBAN COMMUNITIES

We have noted how the growth of cities with their elaborate organization for service tends
to divert attention from the less conspicuous county government. While probably half the counties
of the United States contain no city, or "town," or village of 2500 people, there is in almost
every township at least one compact settlement that has grown up around the trading center.
Sometimes there are several of them in a township and many in a county. In such compact communities
cooperation becomes necessary to provide for needs that are not felt in more rural districts,
such as paved streets, sewers, public water supply, fire and police protection, and so on.
A separate government becomes necessary. The people of such communities may appeal to the authorities
of township, county, or state, for incorporation as a village, borough, town, or city. "Village"
and "borough" are simply two names used in different localities for the same thing. The difference
between them and an incorporated town or city is principally one of size and corresponding
complexity of organization.

GOVERNMENT OF VILLAGES AND INCORPORATED TOWNS

The chief governing body of a village, or borough, or incorporated town, is a small council,
or board, elected by the people. It has legislative powers in a small way, enacting ORDINANCES
for the regulation of local officers and in the public interest.

In Michigan ... they may prescribe the terms and conditions for licensing taverns, peddlers,
and public vehicles. They have control of streets, bridges and public grounds; and have authority
to construct bridges and pavements, and to regulate the use and prevent the obstruction of
the highways. They may establish and maintain sewers and drains. They may construct and control
public wharves, and regulate and license ferries. They may establish and regulate markets.
They may provide a police force and a fire department. They may construct or purchase and operate
water works and lighting plants. They may own cemeteries, public pounds, public buildings and
parks.[Footnote: John A. Fairlie, Local Government in Counties, Towns, and Villages, pp. 207, 208.]

The council also has limited power to levy taxes and to borrow money for public purposes.

There is a chief executive officer, sometimes called MAYOR, sometimes president, or by other
names. Subordinate to him are various other officers, such as the police marshal, the street
commissioner, fire marshal, tax assessor, treasurer, clerk, and so on. In larger villages boards
of health and other boards and commissions exist to administer various forms of public service.
The village may also have its minor court presided over by a justice of the peace.

CITY GOVERNMENT

When villages or towns reach a certain population usually fixed by state law, they may be incorporated
as cities. The change that takes place is simply one of elaborating the governing machinery
and giving to it larger powers to correspond with the larger needs of city life. The complex
problems of city government we shall not attempt to study in this book.

CHANGES IN URBAN GOVERNMENT FOR BETTER SERVICE AND BETTER CONTROL

Great improvement in the government of towns and cities has been made in recent years. The
latest plan of government to be adopted, and it has spread to a considerable number of towns
and cities in the United States, is the CITY MANAGER, or TOWN MANAGER, form of government.
By this plan the voters elect a small council, or board of directors, who in turn appoint a
MANAGER who serves as a superintendent over the affairs of the city or town. He is a trained
specialist, often an engineer, and cities and towns sometimes search the country over for the
best man available for the place. The manager appoints the heads of the various departments
of government, such as health, police, public works, etc., and is responsible to the council
for their work. It is the application to town government of methods long used by successful
business corporations.

CHAPTER XXVI

OUR STATE GOVERNMENTS

SOURCE OF GOVERNING POWER

When the thirteen original states were colonies, they derived their governing powers from CHARTERS
granted to them by the king, as cities and some counties are granted charters by the state.
When they won their independence the people of each state substituted a CONSTITUTION for the
charter; the difference between a charter and a constitution being that the former is given
TO the people by some higher authority, while the latter is adopted BY the people themselves.
All of our states alike, whether created before or after the Union was formed, are self-governing
under constitutions of their own making.

Counties and towns, cities and villages, have no powers of self- government except those granted
to them BY THE STATE. The national government, also, may exercise only such powers as are given
to it by the people VOTING AS STATES. Each state, on the other hand, is self-governing in its
own right, and may exercise through its government any power whatever, excepting only those
which it voluntarily surrendered upon entering the Union. (See pp. 94, 449; also Constitution,
Art. I, Sec. 10 and Art. IV.)

THE STATE CONSTITUTION

The state constitution is the supreme law of the state and is supposed to represent the direct
voice of the people. Since the Union was formed, state constitutions have been framed by conventions
of delegates elected especially for the purpose, and in most cases have been submitted to the
people for their ratification. Amendments may be proposed either by such conventions or by
the state legislatures, but they must also be ratified by the people. Some of the states have
completely revised their constitutions several times, and amendments have been very numerous.

CAUSE OF LENGTH OF STATE CONSTITUTIONS

State constitutions are long documents, containing a great deal of detail regarding the organization
and powers of government. In this respect they differ from the national Constitution, which
is brief and speaks in broad, general terms. Recent constitutions are longer than earlier ones,
partly because there is a greater variety of problems to be dealt with, but also because of
a growing tendency to limit the powers of legislatures and administrative officers.

A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT

After a DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, which all state constitutions contain, the constitution is concerned
chiefly with the organization, powers and duties of the government. Each state may organize
its government as it sees fit, provided only that it is "republican" in form as required by
the federal Constitution (Art. IV, sec. 4). This means that it must be a form of representative
self-government.

SEPARATION OF POWERS

While the state governments differ from one another in matters of detail, the general plan
is the same in all. Each consists of three branches: the legislative branch for lawmaking;
the executive branch for law enforcement and administration; and the judicial branch for the
interpretation of the laws and for the administration of justice in accordance with the law.
These three branches are organized on the principle of a SEPARATION OF POWERS, to prevent encroachment
by one upon the powers of the others, and to make each a check upon the powers of the others.

In the government of this commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the
executive and judicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise the legislative
and judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and
executive powers, or either of them; to the end it may be a government of laws, and not of
men. [Footnote: Constitution of Massachusetts, Part I, Art. XXX.]

THE GOVERNOR

The chief executive officer of the state is the governor, who is elected by the people for
a term which varies, in the different states, from one to four years. It is his duty to see
that the laws of the state are faithfully executed. The constitution makes him the commander-in-chief
of the state militia, which he may call upon to enforce the laws or to quell disorders. It
also gives him the power to pardon persons convicted of crime, in the exercise of which power
he is sometimes assisted by a special board of pardons and sometimes by the legislature; but
the consideration of the pleas of such persons and their friends for pardon often consumes
much of his time.

THE GOVERNOR'S VARIED DUTIES

A great deal of the governor's time is also taken up with duties devolving upon him as the
official representative of the state on ceremonial occasions, as in the laying of corner-stones
of public buildings, attending state fairs, and making speeches at public meetings of all kinds.
By virtue of his office he is also a member of many boards and commissions whose meetings he
must attend.

THE GOVERNOR'S PART IN LAWMAKING

The governor also has some part in lawmaking. In all states except North Carolina he has the
power to VETO bills passed by the legislature. This check upon the legislature is not absolute,
for the legislature may overcome the governor's veto by again passing the bill, usually by
a two-thirds vote. The governor may also influence legislation by means of his messages to
the legislature in which he recommends measures which he believes should be enacted into law.
In case of opposition by the legislature, the governor often carries his proposals directly
to the people, who quickly make known whether or not they support him. The governor may call
special sessions of the legislature to consider measures of especial importance.

GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE GOVERNOR

The governor is a more influential officer today than he was in the early part of our history.
In colonial times he was the direct representative of the king, or of the colonial proprietor,
and the people sought in every way to limit his powers. After the colonies became states this
habitual fear of the governor continued, and he was placed under the control of the legislature.
As time went on, however, the legislature fell under the suspicion of the people, while the
governor was more and more looked to as their leader. Thus, for example, the veto power was
given to him, increasing his influence while it curbed that of the legislature.

WEAKNESS OF THE STATE EXECUTIVE

But the power and influence of the governor are by no means as great in relation to state government
as are the powers of the President in relation to the national government. In fact, the executive
branch of our state governments has been notoriously weak, and its weakness is of the same
kind as that noted in county government: the lack of an effective, responsible head.

COMPARISON OF STATE WITH NATIONAL EXECUTIVE

In our national government the executive power is concentrated in the hands of one man. State
constitutions seem to confer the same powers upon the governor. The constitution of Indiana
says, "The executive powers of the State shall be vested in a Governor"; and that of Pennsylvania
says, "The supreme executive power shall be vested in the Governor." But the Pennsylvania constitution
also says, "The executive department shall consist of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary
of the Commonwealth, Attorney General, Auditor General, State Treasurer, Secretary of Internal
Affairs and a Superintendent of Public Instruction" (Art. IV, Sec. I). Four of these officers
besides the governor are elected by the people.

BEWILDERING COMPLEXITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES

In all states the governor "shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed" (Pennsylvania
constitution). For the execution of the laws, however, he is dependent not only upon a number
of principal executive officers such as those named above, but also upon a large number of
less important administrative officers. Governor Lowden, of Illinois, a few years ago said:

Administrative agencies have been multiplied in bewildering confusion. They have been created
without reference to their ability economically and effectively to administer the laws. Separate
boards govern the penitentiaries, the reformatories, and the educational institutions. Several
boards and commissions have charge of matters affecting the agricultural interests. Administration
of laws affecting labor is parceled out among numerous agencies, including several boards having
jurisdiction of mining problems and several free employment agencies, each independent of the
other. Our finance administration is chaotic, illogical and confused.

The administration of the health laws is divided between boards and commissions, with no effective
means of coordination. Our educational agencies are not harmonious. Over one hundred officers,
boards, agencies, commissions, institutions and departments are charged with the administration
of our laws. No systematic organization exists, and no adequate control can be exercised ...
Under the present system the governor cannot exercise the supervision and control which the
people have a right to demand. [Footnote: Charles E. Woodward, "The Illinois Civil Administrative
Code," reprinted from Proceedings, Academy of Political Science, July, 1918.]

GOVERNOR LACKS POWER TO MEET HIS RESPONSIBILITY

This condition of affairs is characteristic of state governments generally. Some of the numerous
officers are appointed by the governor, but many of them are elected by the people or appointed
by the legislature. Their terms of office do not coincide with that of the governor, so that
he finds in office many persons whom he did not appoint, and whom he cannot remove. Often they
may be of an opposite political party. Thus the very organization of the state executive department
is such as to make it impossible for the governor to perform the duty, imposed upon him by
the constitution, of seeing to it that the laws are faithfully executed. It must be remembered,
moreover, that the execution of the laws is also dependent largely upon a multitude of local
officers over whom the state exercises little control. It is apparent how imperfect must be
the teamwork of the people through this organization.

UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS AT POPULAR CONTROL

Why have the people put up with this sort of thing? For one thing, they have not understood
where the trouble lies. There is also seen the influence of the political "boss," who thrives
under this confusion. But among the causes is the desire of the people to maintain control
over government. They have attempted, in their constitutions, not only to say just what services
should be performed for them, but also to specify just what machinery should be used for their
performance. For every new service, they have created a new and independent piece of machinery.
Then, to make their control complete, as they thought, they have made most of their new officers
elective. Experience has shown that control of this kind has been gained only at the sacrifice
of efficient service, through failure to provide trained leadership and effective organization.
Moreover, experience has also shown that control of this kind is largely a delusion; for the
people cannot keep in touch with their multitude of officers, and in many cases yield their
control, often unknowingly, to the political "boss."

EXPERIMENT NECESSARY TO PROGRESS

In noting these defects, it is not to be concluded that our state governments have been a failure
in all respects. Far from it. Notable progress has been made toward the ideals toward which
we have been striving. We have tried one experiment after another, some of which have been
highly successful, but others of which have not met the test of new conditions. It is important,
however, that we should face our failures squarely and profit by them.

REORGANIZATION OF EXECUTIVE

At the present time there is a marked effort to overcome the defects that we have just noted,
and a good deal of progress toward it has been made in some states. One of the most progressive
states in this particular is Illinois, which has recently enacted a law for the reorganization
of its executive branch of government.

Under the new "Civil Administrative Code" of Illinois, the executive branch of government is
organized in nine departments: the departments of finance, of agriculture, of labor, of mines
and minerals, of public works and buildings, of public welfare, of public health, of trade
and commerce, and of registration and education.

At the head of each department is a director, who is appointed by the governor, is responsible
to him, and whose term of office is the same as that of the governor.

Each department is organized into various bureaus, or other subdivisions, with officers in
charge who are directly responsible to the director of the department. Thus, in the department
of agriculture there is an assistant director, a general manager of the state fair, a superintendent
of foods and dairies, a superintendent of animal industry, a superintendent of plant industry,
a chief veterinarian, a chief game and fish warden, and a food standard commission of three
members.

All subordinate employees in all departments are appointed under a civil service law which
requires competitive examinations.

Associated with most of the departments are "advisory boards" consisting of citizens who serve
without pay. Thus, the department of agriculture has a board of agricultural advisers composed
of fifteen persons, and a board of state fair advisers of nine persons, not more than three
of whom shall be appointed from any one county.

The things aimed at in this reorganization are: (I) fixing responsibility for the entire service-organization
in one place-- with the governor; (2) responsible, trained leadership in each department of
service; (3) responsiveness of leadership to the people's wants, as provided for by the advisory
boards; (4) a system of accounting and records that will make for efficiency and economy, and
that will inform the people as well as the officers of government.

THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

The legislative branch of government consists, in all states, of a legislature ("general assembly,"
"legislative assembly," or "general court") composed of two "houses" or "chambers," the house
of representatives and the senate. The senate is the "upper house," and is usually from one-third
to one-half the size of the "lower house"; in Massachusetts only one-sixth the size.

THE TWO HOUSES

A bill to become a law must pass both houses separately, each house acting as a check upon
the other, thus securing greater deliberation in lawmaking. The senate is supposed to be, and
usually is, a more conservative, or cautious, body than the house of representatives, partly
because of its smaller size which makes possible a more careful consideration of business.
Its members are elected from larger districts, thus increasing the opportunity to select able
men. A higher age qualification is required for membership in the senate than in the house
of representatives; and only a part of the senate is elected at each election, so that it is
a continuing body, always containing members of experience, while the lower house may be almost
entirely changed at each election.

DEFECTS IN DISTRIBUTION OF REPRESENTATION

It is a theory of our representative government that representation should be proportional
to population. To secure this result, each state is divided into election districts presumably
of as nearly equal population as possible, the senatorial districts being the larger. In practice,
however, these districts do not always have representation proportional to their population.
The county is often the unit of representation, or in New England the town, and these districts
vary greatly in population. An attempt is made to equalize the difference by providing that
no district shall have less than one representative, and often that none shall have more than
a certain number. Inequalities nevertheless exist. In Connecticut, thirty- four of the most
populous towns and cities have sixty-eight members in the lower house, whereas if the distribution
were made on the basis of population they would be entitled to 186 members. Again, four of
the smallest Connecticut towns, with a total population of 1567, have five members; four of
the most populous cities, containing 309,982 inhabitants, have only eight members, whereas
on the basis of population they would be entitled to eighty-seven. [Footnote: C.A., Beard,
America Government and Politics, p. 521.]

Partisan influences often enter into the districting of states for representation, the party
in power trying to fix boundaries so as to ensure keeping their majority in the legislature.

The "gerrymander": what is it, and has it been used in your state?

The legislature controls our lives at almost every turn.

It has control over the whole domain of civil law; [Footnote 2: See below, p. 437.] that is,
it lays down the rules governing contracts, real and personal property, inheritance, corporations,
mortgages, marriage and divorce, and other civil matters. It defines crime; that is, it prescribes
those actions of the citizen which are to be punished by fine or imprisonment or death. It
touches the property of the citizen not only by regulating its use, but also by imposing upon
it a burden of taxation. Finally, it has control over the vast domain known as the police power,
under which it makes regulations concerning public health, morals, and welfare, devises rules
for the conduct of business and professions, and in other ways restrains the liberty of the
citizen to do as he pleases. [Footnote 3: C.A. Beard, America Government and Politics,, p. 516.]

ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE TOWARD THEIR LEGISLATURES

In view of this importance, it would seem that the people would have the keenest interest in
their state legislatures and the greatest respect for them. This has not always been the case.
As one writer says, "it has become almost fashionable" to speak slightingly of legislatures
and their members, and to talk of them as if they were wholly corrupt and dishonorable. If
the very best men the community affords are not always chosen for the difficult and responsible
work of lawmaking, the people have no one to blame but themselves. Moreover, the members of
our legislatures average up very much like their neighbors, and most of them are sincerely
desirous of serving their state and do so to the fullest extent possible under the conditions
that exist.

It is indeed time that a different attitude should be assumed toward these bodies. ... Acquaintance
with actual legislatures will immediately reveal the fact that they are fairly representative
of the American people, and that there is in them, a great deal of honest effort to grapple
with the difficult problems of legislation. ... Before all, there ought to be a sustained effort
to support the men who are with honest purpose struggling for equitable and effective legislation.
...[Footnote: Paul S. Reinsch, American Legislatures and Legislative Methods, p. 126.]

 DIFFICULTIES OF WISE LEGISLATION

Most of the unwise and harmful legislation has been due, not to wrong intentions on the part
of legislators, but to the difficulty encountered by a body of men of average intelligence
and of little experience in dealing with public questions, in getting information necessary
to enable them to decide wisely with respect to the multitude of complicated problems that
come before them during the brief session of the legislature.

In the lower house of one typical legislature only 19 out of the 252 members had ever been
members of a legislature before, 123 were farmers, 6 lawyers, 10 physicians, 48 merchants and
manufacturers, 3 bankers, 5 preachers, 6 insurance men, 2 hotel proprietors, 3 liverymen, 14
laborers or artisans, 6 "apparently with no occupation except that of general politician and
office- seeker."

Of the thirty members of the senate of the same legislature, 9 were farmers, 4 lawyers, 4 physicians,
and 13 merchants. Seven of these had completed their education in "academies," while 13 had
never got beyond the public schools.

These men had to decide, in the course of a few weeks, upon an astonishing variety of problems,
some of them of the greatest complexity, and all of them affecting the lives of the citizens
of the state in a multitude of ways. It is not surprising that serious mistakes are sometimes
made. [Footnote: C. A. Beard, American Government and Politics, p. 525 (from S. P. Orth, "Our
State Legislatures," Atlantic Monthly, vol. xciv, pp. 728 ff.)]

The mere writing of a bill in language that will convey the exact meaning intended, and that
will not involve undesirable and unexpected results, is a difficult matter that requires the
skill of men trained for it.

LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE BUREAUS

In a number of states an attempt has been made to meet these natural difficulties by the establishment
of legislative reference libraries, or bureaus, in charge of highly trained students who collect
all available information relating to every possible subject of legislation, keep records of
legislation in other states, and place the material in convenient form at the disposal of the
legislators. Sometimes they provide expert service in the writing of bills in the proper form.
It is said that such legislative reference bureaus have already greatly improved the quality
of legislation in some of the states.

It would be impossible for a legislature, acting as a body, to give consideration to more than
a small fraction of the bills that come before it.

It is said that it is not unusual for more than 2500 bills to be introduced at a single session.
Legislatures are in session from 40 to 90 days. If the session were 60 days, and the working
day 10 hours, there would be but 15 minutes for each of 2500 bills. This time would be divided
between the two houses. Besides, a great deal of business must be transacted other than the
consideration and passage of bills.

THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM OF LEGISLATION

To make possible the handling of all this work, each house is organized in standing committees.
As bills are introduced, they are referred to their appropriate committees, in which most of
the work of lawmaking is done. Most of the bills so referred are never reported back to the
legislature at all, and those that are reported are in most cases acted upon by the legislature
in accordance with the committees' reports, with little general discussion. The procedure followed
in referring bills to committees and in considering them when they are reported back is determined
by a complexity of rules that are confusing to the outsider and that cannot be explained in
detail here. But their declared purpose is to save time and to enable the legislative business
to move smoothly. The small committees can work to better advantage than the large body of
men in either chamber. The work is divided up so that the few members of each committee can
concentrate their attention upon a few subjects and gain experience in handling special kinds
of problems.

INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT

On the other hand, it is to this organization that we owe some of the bad lawmaking for which
our legislatures are blamed. It tends to remove legislation from the control of the people,
and results in what is often called "invisible government," government that is carried on out
of sight of the people. It opens a door to partisan influences and to control by political
"bosses" and self-seeking "interests." In the lower house the committees are appointed by the
speaker, who is the presiding officer, and who is always chosen by the members of the majority
party in the house from their own number. The senate committees are sometimes appointed by
the presiding officer of the senate, who is often the lieutenant- governor, and sometimes elected
by the senate itself. But the chairmen and the majority of the members of all committees in
both houses belong to the majority party, which is thus enabled to control legislation for
partisan ends if it so desires, and it often does so.

EVILS OF THE SYSTEM

Bills may be "killed" in committee, or reported unfavorably, or so amended as to change their
meaning entirely, merely at the will of the party leaders, or of "bosses" and interests outside
of the legislature. A large part of the work of the committees is carried on in secret. Although
"hearings" may be held at which citizens may present arguments for and against proposed measures,
these may be mere matters of form. Influential interests may maintain a lobby at the legislature,
which means that they are represented there by agents who seek to influence the members of
the legislature, and especially of the committees, sometimes by corrupt methods. The lobby
often works by secret methods, whereas the "hearings" are public.

The party leaders in control, of whom the most important are the speaker of the house, the
rules committee, the chairmen of committees, and the "floor manager," by dictating the procedure
to be followed, may at times make it practically impossible for a member of the minority party,
or one who has incurred the displeasure of the leaders, to gain a hearing. The following description
gives an idea of what may happen: [Footnote: From a pamphlet issued by the Illinois Legislative
Voters' League in 1903, and quoted by C. A. Beard, American Government and Politics, pp 539, 540.]

Consider the petty annoyances to which a decent member outside the "organization" may be subjected,
and the methods by which legitimate legislation, backed by him, may be blocked. The bill goes
to an unfriendly committee. The chairman refuses to call the committee together, or when forced
to call it, a quorum does not attend. ... Action may be postponed on various pretexts, or the
bill may be referred to a sub-committee. The committee may kill the bill by laying it on the
table. On the other hand, the committee may decide that the bill be reported to the house to
pass. Then a common practice is for the chairman to pocket the bill, delaying to report it
to the house till too late to pass it. When finally reported to the house, it goes on the calendar
to be read a first time in its order. Then begins the advancing of bills by unanimous consent,
without waiting to reach them in order. Here is where the organization has absolute control.
Unanimous consent is subject to the speaker's acuteness of hearing. His hearing is sharpened
or dulled according to the good standing of the objector or of the member pushing the bill.
If one not friendly to the house "organization" wants to have his bill considered over an objection,
he must move to suspend the rules. The speaker may refuse to recognize him, or may put his
motion and declare it carried or not carried as suits his and the organization's desires. If
the bill of the independent member reaches a second reading, it may be killed by striking out
the enacting clause or by tacking on an obnoxious amendment that makes it repulsive to its
former friends. ... To carry out the will of the organization, the speaker declares amendments
carried or the contrary by a viva voce vote. Demands for roll-calls are ignored by him in violation
of the members' constitutional rights. ...

EFFORTS TO CURB POWER OF LEGISLATURES

It is such practices as these that have brought state legislatures into bad repute, and that
have resulted in measures to curb their power. Instead of leaving it entirely to them to make
their own rules of procedure, many of these rules are now prescribed by the state constitutions.
It was in order to restrain the legislatures that the veto power has been given to the governors
of all states but one, and that sessions of legislatures have been limited to brief periods
of from forty to ninety days, and then only once in two years. For the same reason state constitutions
have taken away powers that legislatures once commonly abused, as in running the state deeply
into debt, or in legislating in the interest of particular localities or particular groups;
and have provided in great detail for many things that were formerly left to the discretion
of the legislatures. For the same reason some states have adopted the initiative and referendum.

INEFFICIENT BUSINESS METHODS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS

Some of the greatest abuses of governing power have been in connection with the appropriation
of money. They have been due not so much to dishonesty as to bad organization and loose business
methods, both in the executive and legislative branches of government. When the executive branch
consists of a large number of more or less independent parts, each trying to make the best
showing possible, it is quite to be expected that each will seek to get from the public treasury
all the money possible without reference to the needs of other parts or to the resources of
the state. When, in addition, there is no central executive authority with power to hold the
heads of the various parts responsible for their acts, and no uniform or businesslike system
of keeping accounts, either of money expended or of work accomplished, it is easy to see the
opportunity for wastefulness and inefficiency.

WASTEFUL METHODS OF MAKING APPROPRIATIONS

On the other hand, the methods of making appropriations in the legislature have been equally
conducive to wastefulness. Appropriation bills pass through the same legislative machinery
as all other bills and are subject to the same dangers. Moreover, they are handled by different
committees that act as independently of one another as do the various executive departments.
In Illinois, for example, until recently "requests for appropriations were submitted informally
by each office, department, or board; and separate bills were prepared by the several departments
and institutions, and introduced by individual members of the General Assembly," l[Footnote:
John A. Fairlie, Budget Methods in Illinois, Annals of the American Academy of Political and
Social Science, November, 1915; quoted by W. F. Willoughby, in The Movement for Budgetary Reform
in the States, p. 45.] then being referred to different committees according to the subjects
to which they related. At the session of 1913, 94 separate appropriation acts were passed.

THE BUDGET SYSTEM

A number of the states have sought to remedy this defect in government by the adoption of a
budget system (see Chapter XIII). Illinois has perhaps made the complete reform in this matter.
We have already seen how that state has reorganized its executive branch of government, which
is the first necessary step. In this reorganization there was created a finance department,
to which all the administrative departments submit a careful estimate of the money needed for
their various lines of work, together with a detailed statement of work done and money spent
during the two preceding years. The finance department considers all these statements and estimates
in their relation to one another and to the financial resources available for the next two
years, and submits to the governor a comprehensive and detailed budget. On the basis of this,
a single appropriation bill is prepared by a single committee of the legislature. Public hearings
are held, the people are given opportunity to know just what the government has done and intends
to do, and the governor and his finance department may be held responsible.

No single change would add so largely to both democracy and efficiency as the introduction
of proper budget methods.

THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

Questions are continually arising as to the meaning of laws, or as to how they apply in particular
cases. To answer these questions the judicial branch of government exists, comprising a system
of courts. The courts are sometimes called upon to decide whether a law passed by the legislature,
or an act of an administrative officer, is in harmony with the constitution, and if not, to
declare such law or act invalid. The judicial branch of government is therefore the people's
organization to keep the other branches of government within their constitutional powers.

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES

In most cases that come before the courts, however, the law is perfectly clear when once the
facts in the case are known. It is therefore the business of the courts also to ascertain the
facts. There are two classes of cases that come before the courts, civil cases and criminal
cases; and the law that applies to the two classes is known as civil law and criminal law.
A civil case is one that involves a dispute between individuals, or an injury done by one individual
to another. Such would be a dispute over a boundary line between the properties of two individuals,
or over the payment of a debt; or a personal injury due to the carelessness of some one, or
an injury to property or to health through maintaining a nuisance of some kind. In such cases
the court, after ascertaining the facts, merely sees that justice is done, as by the payment
of damages to the injured party by the one doing the injury. A criminal case is one in which
a person is charged with having violated a law of the community. The injury is one against
the community as a whole, and not merely against an individual. It is the community that appears
in court against the accused person, and not merely one of his neighbors. In such cases the
court first ascertains the guilt or innocence of the accused person; and if he is guilty, imposes
a PUNISHMENT upon him, such as a fine, or imprisonment, or even death, according to the nature
of the crime.

The judicial branch of government, then, is that part of the governmental organization that
seeks to adjust, by peaceful and just means, the inevitable conflicts that arise in community life.

JUSTICES' COURTS

The lowest in the series of state courts are the JUSTICES' COURTS, of which there is at least
one in every township. They are presided over by justices of the peace. Only cases of small
moment come before justices' courts: civil cases involving very small amounts, and cases of
minor infractions of the law punishable by small fines or by short terms in jail. Persons accused
of more serious crimes may have a preliminary examination in a justice's court and, if the
evidence warrants it, be committed to jail to await the action of the grand jury (see below).
Most cases in a justice's court are disposed of by the justice of the peace alone; but a jury
trial may be demanded in all criminal cases, and in civil suits "where the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars" (Const., Amendments VI, VII).

COUNTY COURTS

More serious cases, civil or criminal, are tried in the COUNTY, or DISTRICT, courts before
a judge and a JURY. Cases that have been tried in a justice's court may be APPEALED to the
county or district court, where there is sure to be a jury trial, and where the judge is more
learned in the law than is a justice of the peace. It is the business of the jury to decide
on the facts in the case on the evidence furnished in the trial, and in civil cases to award
the amount of damages, if any, to be paid; while the judge sees that the procedure is in accordance
with the law, instructs the jury as to the law in the case, and in criminal cases fixes the
penalty within the limits permitted by the law.

THE COMMUNITY IN COURT

It was stated above that in criminal cases it is the COMMUNITY that appears against the accused.
The community appears in the person of the district attorney, otherwise called the prosecuting
attorney, state's attorney, or county solicitor. It is the business of this officer to gather
evidence of crimes committed in the community and, in most cases, to submit it to the GRAND
JURY, which is a body of citizens carefully chosen to consider such evidence. If the grand
jury considers the evidence against the accused sufficient to warrant bringing him to trial,
it brings in an INDICTMENT against him. The prosecuting attorney then prosecutes the case for
the community against the accused. It is of course his duty to secure exact justice; sometimes,
however, he seems interested only in securing the CONVICTION of the accused.

RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED

Our state and national constitutions seek to protect carefully the rights of a person accused
of crime. He is assumed to be innocent until he has been proved otherwise. He is guaranteed
a "speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury." (Const., Amendment VI). (Amendment VIII).

CIRCUIT OR SUPERIOR COURTS

In some states there is another set of courts immediately above the county courts, known as
CIRCUIT, DISTRICT, or SUPERIOR, courts. The districts in which these courts have jurisdiction
include several counties. The cases courts handled by them are either cases of appeal from
the lower courts, or cases of greater importance than those over which the lower courts have
jurisdiction.

THE STATE SUPREME COURT

The highest court in the state is the SUPREME COURT, sometimes called the COURT OF APPEALS,
or the COURT OF ERRORS. In the supreme court several judges sit together, and there is no jury.
The cases that come before it are for the most part cases of appeal from the lower courts,
although there are certain classes of cases that come before it in the first instance. The
supreme court is the final judge as to whether acts of the legislature are in conformity with
the state constitution.

OTHER COURTS

In addition to the courts named above there are sometimes others to deal with special classes
of cases. In cities there are MUNICIPAL COURTS and POLICE COURTS, both in the same class with
justices' courts. There are JUVENILE COURTS to deal with juvenile offenders; PROBATE, or SURROGATE,
COURTS to settle the estates of persons who have died; COURTS OF CLAIMS to settle claims against
the state; and CHANCERY COURTS, or courts of EQUITY, which administer justice in cases that
the ordinary law will not reach.

For example, the LAW will permit a man's property to be taken to satisfy a mortgage; EQUITY
requires that the property be sold and the surplus over the amount of the mortgage returned
to the owner. The LAW will grant damages for any injury inflicted; EQUITY will, by an injunction,
forbid a repetition of the injury.

SELECTION OF JUDGES

The judges of the state courts were originally appointed by the governors, or by the legislatures.
With the movement toward more democratic forms of government, the states began to introduce
provisions in their constitutions for the election of judges by the people, and they are now
so chosen in most states, though in a number they are appointed by the governor, and in a few
by the legislature. It is highly important that judges should be controlled in their decisions
solely by the desire to render justice, and that they should be removed as far as possible
from partisan influences. Popular election of judges is most prevalent because it seems to
give to the people the most direct control over their courts. On the other hand, it is opposed
by many because it makes possible the election of incompetent judges, and because it does not
necessarily remove the matter from partisan influences. In three states (California, Oregon
and Arizona) the judges are subject to recall by the people.

The terms during which judges hold office also vary greatly among the states. In three states
they hold office for life (Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire). In the other states
their terms vary from two to twenty-one years.

It seems to be the opinion of most students that the state courts would be improved if their
judges were appointed by the chief executive and should hold office for life, or during good
behavior, as is the case in the federal courts.

CHAPTER XXVII

OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT

THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT

It was the necessity for team work in carrying on the War for Independence that led the thirteen
American colonies for the first time to unite under a common government. They had revolted
to escape from an autocratic government, and they sought to avoid setting up another in its
place. Since it had been the king whom they distrusted most, they endeavored to get along without
any executive head at all. Their new government consisted solely of a Congress of delegates
from the thirteen states.

THE CRITICAL PERIOD

This form of government was continued for several years after the Revolution under a constitution
known as the Articles of Confederation. It was, however, unsuccessful in securing anything
like real national cooperation. The Congress had no power to levy and collect taxes, it had
little power to make laws, and it was without means to execute the laws that it did make. The
real governing power during this period was with the several states. The result was a period
of unutterable confusion which has been called "the critical period of American history." The
question at stake was whether a number of self-governing state communities with a multitude
of apparently conflicting interests could really become a nation.

THE NEW CONSTITUTION

During the war Benjamin Franklin had said, "We must all hang together or we shall all hang
separately." The states had "hung together" sufficiently to win the war; but the wise men of
the time now saw the need for a government so organized and with such powers as to secure effective
cooperation among all the states and all the people at all times for the welfare of the entire
Union, while leaving each state free to manage its own local affairs. Therefore a convention
of delegates from all the states was called together at Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the
Articles of Confederation. The result was our present Constitution under which our present
national government went into effect in 1789.

Investigate and report:

Art. VII).

POPULAR CONTROL THROUGH THE CONSTITUTION

"We, the people of the United States" "ordained and established" the Constitution (see the
Preamble). It was also "ordained" in the Constitution (Art. V) that it could be amended only
by methods designed to give the people control over the matter--greater control than they have
over ordinary lawmaking. A great many amendments have been proposed in the course of time,
but only eighteen have so far been adopted,[Footnote: A nineteenth amendment is at this writing
before the states for ratification-- the woman suffrage amendment.] ten of these having been
adopted in the very beginning as a condition on which the states would accept the Constitution
at all. None of these amendments changed the form of our government except with respect to
the methods of electing the President and United States senators (Amendments XII and XVII).

Explain the two methods of proposing, and the two methods of ratifying, amendments (Constitution,
Art. VII).

Has there ever been a national constitutional convention called by the states?

Which of the two methods of ratifying was used in the case of the last amendment adopted? [Footnote:
Ohio by a referendum in 1919 submitted the eighteenth amendment to the people of the state
for their vote, after it had been ratified by the legislature. This was the first time in our
history that an amendment to the Constitution was submitted to popular vote for ratification.]

Did your state vote to ratify or to reject the last amendment?

If any amendment is now before the states for ratification, watch the newspapers for the action
of the various states.

OUR GOVERNMENT A GROWING THING

The Constitution adopted in 1787 has met the needs of our growing nation in a most remarkable
way. It would be a mistake, however, to think that it has always met new conditions perfectly,
or that we are governed to-day exactly as was intended by the framers of the Constitution.
Although few amendments have been made, INTERPRETATIONS have been placed on the Constitution
that were probably unthought of by the framers or by the people who ratified it; and PRACTICES
have grown up in our government that have made it quite a different government from that which
was anticipated. Our government is a GROWING thing, and one of the chief merits of our Constitution
is the fact that it speaks in such general terms that it has been possible, under it, to adapt
our government to new and unexpected conditions. In this respect it differs from the detailed
state constitutions.

DEFECTS INEVITABLE

On the other hand, conditions have arisen with the growth of our nation that our Constitution
has not enabled us to meet with the greatest success, and that we have not yet met by amendment.
In some cases we have tried to get around the difficulties by devices not provided for in the
Constitution, sometimes with unfortunate results. But a recognition of defects in our government
should not cause us to lose respect for the Constitution. They are due not to positive blunders
on the part of the framers, but to the mere absence of provision for conditions that did not
exist when the Constitution was framed and that could not be foreseen by the wisest men of
that time. The wise course for all good citizens is to seek to understand clearly wherein our
government fails to meet our needs, if it does fail, and then to seek to correct the difficulty,
under the existing terms of the Constitution if possible, or by amendment of the Constitution
if that becomes clearly necessary. Amendment of the Constitution was purposely made difficult,
and this was doubtless wise, for it tends to prevent changes without full consideration of
their needs and probable effects. Radical changes in our form of government and in our established
laws are always fraught with danger. Because of the extreme complexity of community life a
change effected at one point to meet a particular evil may have consequences of the most far-reaching
kind and in the most unexpected directions. A change that corrects one evil may produce conditions
resulting in evils even worse than the first. Changes are necessary at times, but they should
be made only after the most careful consideration by men of the widest possible experience.

THE BILL OF RIGHTS

One thing that stood out clearly after the Revolution was the fear of a strong national government.
Some of the states refused to ratify the Constitution unless amendments were added at once
guaranteeing the liberties of the people. The first ten amendments, known as the "bill of rights,"
were the result.

Read the first ten amendments and discuss the meaning of each.

A GOVERNMENT OF DELEGATED POWERS

It was clearly expected that most of the governing powers to which the people were subject
should be exercised by the states, and not by the national government. The national government
was to exercise no powers except such as were DELEGATED to it in the Constitution. Certain
powers were also expressly denied to the national government in section 9 of Article I.

Discuss the meaning of each clause in Article I, section 8.

Discuss the meaning of each clause in Article I, section 9.

THE SCOPE OF NATIONAL POWERS

The powers of the national government relate to interstate and foreign affairs, or to matters
that the several states could not well regulate without confusion or injustice. For example,
it was chiefly the confusion in matters pertaining to trade in the period following the Revolution
that made the new government necessary. For similar reasons it was empowered "to establish
post-offices and post-roads," "to establish an uniform rule of naturalization" for immigrants,
and "to promote the progress of science and useful arts" by giving copyrights and patents to
authors and inventors. The states, on the other hand, were expressly forbidden to exercise
any control over some such matters of national and international concern in section 10 of Article
I.

Read section 10, Art I, and discuss the reasons why the powers there mentioned should have
been denied to the states.

THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES

Not only did the framers of the Constitution carefully limit the powers that the national government
might exercise, but they also introduced into the organization of the government various devices
to control it and to prevent any of its parts from assuming too much power. The most important
of these is the system of CHECKS AND BALANCES. In our national government, as in the state
governments, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers are SEPARATED. In early times
in England, the king could make any laws he wished, he could enforce them as he pleased, and
he controlled the courts of justice. In our government the legislature, composed of representatives
of the people, makes the laws; the executive branch of government sees to their enforcement;
and the courts, which are responsible neither to the legislature nor to the executive, interpret
the laws and administer justice in accordance with the laws. This separation of powers is to
prevent any one person or group of persons from exercising too much power, as the king did,
and is a safeguard to the liberty of the people. But the separation of powers IS NOT COMPLETE.
Each branch of government has A LIMITED CONTROL over the others. This constitutes THE SYSTEM
OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, which still further protects the people's liberties.

While the President cannot make the laws, he is given a check upon the lawmaking power of Congress
by his veto power. On the other hand, he cannot, by an excessive use of his veto power, destroy
the lawmaking power of Congress, because Congress may pass laws over the President's veto by
means of a two-thirds vote.

The President cannot make a treaty, nor appoint men to office, without the consent of the senate;
neither can he exercise his executive powers until Congress votes him the necessary money.

If Congress passes a law that is contrary to the Constitution the courts may declare the law
void, and the executive cannot enforce it. The courts, on the other hand, are in a measure
under the control of both Congress and the President, for Congress may create and destroy courts
(except those created by the Constitution), and the President, with the consent of the senate,
appoints the judges.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CHECKS AND BALANCES

The "checks and balances" in the organization of our government have been very effective in
accomplishing the purpose for which they were intended, namely, to protect the liberties of
the people against despotic government. But they have also, at times, been an obstacle to team
work and to effective service. It sometimes happens, for example, that the President represents
one political party, while the majority of one or both houses of Congress are of the opposing
party. The two branches of government may then enter into a struggle on partisan grounds, each
trying to defeat the program of the other. Such a situation was probably unforeseen by the
framers of the Constitution, although it again reminds us of Washington's warning with regard
to the dangers of the party spirit.

THE IMPLIED POWERS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT

With the growth of our nation, the national government has come to perform a vast amount of
service, as we have seen in earlier chapters, and to regulate the lives of the people in a
multitude of ways little dreamed of by the makers of the Constitution. This has been possible
because of the principle of IMPLIED POWERS in the Constitution. This means that some of the
powers expressly granted in the Constitution have been broadly interpreted to IMPLY powers
not expressly stated. There are certain clauses in the Constitution that especially lend themselves
to such broad interpretation. Another clause whose liberal interpretation has been responsible
for much of the service performed by the national government is that giving it the power to
regulate interstate commerce (Art. I, sec. 8, clause 3).

In the early days of our government the Federalist party, under the leadership of Alexander
Hamilton, proposed the creation of a NATIONAL BANK. The Republican party under Jefferson opposed
this because the Constitution did not expressly provide for it, and because it was feared that
it would give the national government too much power. But the "broad constructionists" argued
that a national bank was a "necessary and proper" means to enable the national government "to
borrow money on the credit of the United States" and to exercise other financial powers expressly
granted in the Constitution. The supreme court of the United States supported the latter view,
and the national bank became a fact.

The building of roads and other internal improvements by the national government have always
been opposed by the "strict constructionists," except where roads were clearly "post-roads"
(Article 1, section.8, clause 7). But the "broad constructionists" argued that roads were "necessary
and proper" to provide "for the common defense," and also as a means "to regulate commerce
among the several states."

Most of the work that the national government has done for the promotion of the public health,
such as the passage and enforcement of the "pure food and drugs act," the inspection of livestock
and of slaughterhouses, and the attempt to regulate child labor, has been done under the authority
of the clause giving Congress power to regulate interstate commerce.

EXPANSION OF POWERS BY JUDICIAL DECISION

It has been the duty of the Supreme Court of the United States to decide finally whether much
of the new service undertaken by the national government is in accordance with the Constitution
or not, and this court has been responsible for most of the expansion of the service rendered,
because of its liberal interpretation of the Constitution.

Why should the power to regulate interstate commerce also give Congress the power to require
the inspection of cattle in your neighborhood? or to forbid the use of harmful substances in
patent medicines? or to forbid the employment in factories of children?

Find out what you can about the influence of John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
in extending the powers of the national government.

THE EXECUTIVE CENTRALIZED AND CONTROLLED

The Constitution vests the executive power in the President of the United States (Art. II,
sec. I), and he alone is responsible to the people for the execution of the laws. The people
are protected against abuse of this power in the hands of one man by various constitutional
provisions. The President's term of office is limited to four years, though he may be reelected.
In case of improper conduct in office, he may be removed by IMPEACHMENT. The impeachment charges
must be brought against him by the House of Representatives, and the Senate, presided over
by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, must act as a court to try the case. Moreover, even
the President must act according to law, and in so far as his duties are not prescribed by
the Constitution they are prescribed by Congress. Congress must also create the machinery by
which the President executes the laws, and it must appropriate the necessary money. The Senate
exercises a further control over the President in that it must approve all appointments and
all treaties made by him.

METHOD OF ELECTING THE PRESIDENT

The method of electing the President provided in the Constitution was intended to insure a
wise choice, and also shows a lack of complete confidence in the people on the part of the
framers of the Constitution. He was to be elected by a body of ELECTORS, chosen by the several
states "in such manner as the legislatures thereof may direct," the number of electors from
each state to equal the whole number of senators and representatives from that state (Art.
II, sec. 2). These electors were originally chosen by the legislatures of the states, but are
now elected by the people. When voters "vote for the President" every four years, they in reality
only vote for these electors who, in turn, cast their votes for the President.

DEPARTURE FROM THE INTENTION OF THE CONSTITUTION

In the method of electing the President we find one of the points where the intention of the
framers of the Constitution has clearly been thwarted. It was obviously the intention that
the electors chosen by the states should use their own discretion in the choice of the President.
But in practice to-day, the entire body of electors from each state always represents the victorious
political party, and casts its vote invariably for the presidential candidate already nominated
by the party machinery. We still elect the electors, and the electors go through the form of
electing the President; but their part in the procedure is now entirely useless.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT

The Vice-President of the United States is elected at the same time and by the same method
as the President. But he has no executive duties whatever so long as the President is capable
of performing his duties. In order that he might have something to do, he was made presiding
officer of the Senate, but even there he has no vote.

GROWTH OF THE NATIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION

The President is at the head of a stupendous service organization which was not ready-made
by the Constitution, but which has been gradually created by acts of Congress under its express
and implied powers. (Art. II, sec. 2, cl. i). The heads of these departments are appointed
by the President, are responsible to him, and may be removed by him. Together they constitute
the President's CABINET, meeting with him frequently to discuss the affairs of their departments
and matters of public policy.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS

Five of these administrative departments were created during Washington's administration. These
five have grown to cover a multitude of activities that were not at first contemplated, and
five other great departments have since been created.

The DEPARTMENT OF STATE maintains relations between the United States and foreign powers. The
Secretary of State, acting for the President, negotiates treaties with foreign governments,
and is in constant communication with the ambassadors, ministers, consuls, and other representatives
of our government in foreign countries, and with similar representatives of foreign governments
in this country. This department is the medium of communication between the President and the
governors of the several states. The Secretary of State has in his keeping the treaties and
laws of the United States, and also the Great Seal of the United States, which he affixes to
proclamations, commissions, and other official papers. Through him the rights of American citizens
in foreign countries are looked after. He is first in rank among the members of the cabinet,
and by law would succeed to the Presidency in case of the death or disability of both the President
and the Vice- President.

The DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY has at its head the Secretary of the Treasury, who is the financial
manager of the national government. He prepares plans for, and superintends the collection
of, the public revenues; determines the manner of keeping the public accounts; directs the
coinage and printing of money. He also controls the construction and maintenance of public
buildings, and administers the public health service and the life- saving service.

The DEPARTMENT OF WAR is directed by the Secretary of War, who, under the President, controls
the military establishment and superintends the national defense. He also administers river
and harbor improvements, the prevention of obstruction to navigation, and the building of bridges
over navigable rivers when authorized by Congress. He also has direction of the Bureau of Insular
Affairs, which supervises the government of Porto Rico and the Philippines.

The DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE has at its head the Attorney General, who is the chief law officer
of the government, and represents it in all matters of a legal nature. He is the legal adviser
of the President and of the several executive departments, and supervises all United States
attorneys and marshals in the judicial districts into which the country is divided.

The POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT is administered by the Postmaster General.

The DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, under the Secretary of the Navy, has charge of the "construction,
manning, equipment, and employment of vessels of war."

The DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR was created to relieve the Department of State of work relating
to internal affairs, and now embraces a wide variety of duties. At its head is the Secretary
of the Interior. Through many bureaus and divisions it administers the public lands, the national
parks, the giving of patents for inventions, the pensioning of soldiers, Indian affairs, education,
the reclamation service, the geological survey, the improvement of mining methods for the safety
of miners, certain matters pertaining to the territories of the United States, and certain
institutions in the District of Columbia.

The DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE is directed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Its work is described
in Chapter XII.

The DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, under the Secretary of Commerce, promotes the commercial interests
of the country in many ways. It includes in its organization the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic
Commerce, the Bureau of Corporations, the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Lighthouses, the Bureau
of Navigation, the Bureau of Fisheries, and the Bureau of Standards.

The DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, under the Secretary of Labor, has for its purpose "fostering, promoting,
and developing the welfare of the wage earners of the United States, improving their working
conditions, and advancing their opportunities for profitable employment." Among its important
bureaus are those of Immigration and of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau, which investigates
and reports upon "all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all
classes of our people."

OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

In addition to these great administrative departments with their numerous bureaus and subdivisions,
there are various boards, commissions and establishments that are independent of the departments.

Some of the most important of these are the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Civil Service
Commission (see below), the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the United
States Tariff Commission, the Board of Mediation and Conciliation, the United States Bureau
of Efficiency, the Federal Board of Vocational Education, the Panama Canal.

Of another kind are the Library of Congress which includes the Copyright Office; the Government
Printing Office; the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Museum and the National
Zoological Park.

There are many others. During the recent war a great variety of new administrative commissions
and boards were created for the emergency. Most of these have been, or are to be, discontinued,
though some of them may survive. Such were the Council of National Defense, the Committee on
Public Information, the Food Administration, the Fuel Administration, the United States Shipping
Board, the War Trade Board, the Director General of Railroads.

THE CIVIL SERVICE

The detailed work of this vast service organization is carried on by about 400,000 employees
(not counting the army and the navy). These constitute the CIVIL SERVICE. The quality of service
depends largely upon the efficiency of these employees. The task of filling all these places
is a large one. In Andrew Jackson's administration (1829-1837) the "spoils system" was introduced,
which means that government positions were treated by the victorious party as "the spoils of
victory," to be given to members of the victorious party as rewards for party service without
much regard to fitness for the work to be done. Whenever the administration passed from one
party to another, the army of civil service employees was displaced by another of new employees.
Not only did this result in inefficient service, but the time of the President and the heads
of the departments was largely consumed in considering the claims of those seeking appointment.

Moreover, since appointments could be made only "with the advice and consent" of the Senate,
senators were besieged by applicants for positions and their friends. The President, overwhelmed
by the multitude of appointments to be made, came to rely almost wholly upon the advice of
the senators, and even of members of the House of Representatives, for appointments in their
states and districts. Thus, in effect, appointments were made by members of Congress rather
than by the President who was really responsible. No system could have been devised more wasteful
of the time of the executive and legislative branches of the government, or more conducive
to inefficiency.

REFORM OF THE CIVIL SERVICE

The spoils system became a great offense to the nation, but it was not until President Garfield
was murdered by a disappointed office seeker that Congress, in 1883, passed a law for the reform
of the civil service. Candidates for many positions in the civil service were required to pass
an examination designed to prove their fitness for the work to be done, and a CIVIL SERVICE
COMMISSION was created to administer the law and to conduct the examinations, which are held
at stated intervals in different parts of the country. Those appointed under this system cannot
be removed except for cause. Even at the present time, however, only about half of the civil
service is subject to this MERIT SYSTEM. From the above description of the work of the several
executive departments select topics for special investigation and report; such as:

The work of United States Consuls. Coining money; the United States Bureau of Engraving.

RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP

Efficient government requires strong, clearly recognized leadership. Democratic government
requires that its leadership shall be responsive to the needs of the people and under their
control. The problem of how to secure strong leadership and controlled leadership at one and
the same time is a difficult one. So far as the executive branch of government alone is concerned,
the framers of the Constitution secured strength by concentrating full responsibility in the
President. But did they expect him to be their leader in the government as a whole; that is,
in formulating the policies of government that should serve as the basis for legislation? We
are in the habit of thinking of him as our national leader, but was he made so in fact?

LEADERSHIP OF THE PRESIDENT

In fact, the framers of the Constitution were apparently more concerned about maintaining control
over the President than about clearly making him the nation's leader. (Art. II, sec.3). He
does submit recommendations to Congress at the opening of each of its terms and often at other
times. If the President and the majority in Congress are of the same political party, Congress
is pretty likely to follow the President's lead; or, if the President has a commanding personality
and is clearly popular with the people, he may force measures through even an unwilling Congress.
But if differences arise between the President and Congress, especially when one or both houses
of Congress are of the opposite party from the President, his recommendations may be entirely
ignored. By our system of "checks and balances" the President is "controlled," but he ceases
to be a leader when he does not have the "following" of Congress, or of the majority of the people.

President Wilson began his second administration with a majority in both houses of Congress
of his political party, and apparently in popular favor. He was clearly accepted as leader
and practically all of his proposed measures were favorably acted upon by Congress. In the
middle of this administration a congressional election occurred which resulted in a majority
in both houses of the opposing party. This result might be considered as a popular vote against
the leadership of the President, and his opponents did consider it so. It cannot be absolutely
certain that this was intended, for the people were not voting directly on this question. Whether
this was true or not, Congress refused to follow his leadership in many important questions,
including the treaty of peace with Germany.

CONTROL OF LEADERSHIP IN ENGLAND

It will be helpful to compare this situation with the method by which England has worked out
the problem of leadership and control of leadership.

The real executive head in the English government is the prime minister. The king appoints
the prime minister, but he always chooses for the position THE RECOGNIZED LEADER OF THE POLITICAL
PARTY THAT IS IN THE MAJORITY in the House of Commons (which corresponds to our House of Representatives).

The prime minister having been appointed, he then selects the other members of his cabinet,
who are to be the heads of the executive departments, and WHO ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.

The prime minister and the other members of the cabinet have seats in the House of Commons,
contrary to the practice in our country. THEY ALSO TAKE THE LEAD IN LEGISLATION, for most of
the important bills considered in the House of Commons are planned and introduced by the cabinet.
So the executive and legislative branches of the English government are not separated as in
our country. The same group of men manage the service organization and lead in planning the
legislation that makes the service possible.

It sometimes happens, however, that the cabinet introduces a measure which, after discussion,
a majority of the House of Commons rejects. This means that on this question the cabinet no
longer represents the majority in the House. Then one of two things happens. EITHER THE CABINET
RESIGNS in a body to make way for a new cabinet that does represent the majority; OR THE PRIME
MINISTER ASKS FOR A GENERAL ELECTION FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. If at this election
a majority is again returned that is opposed to the cabinet, it means that the cabinet no longer
leads the people, and it resigns. If a majority is returned in support of the cabinet, it means
that the old House was no longer representative of the people, and the old cabinet retains
its leadership.

This system gives the English people MORE DIRECT CONTROL over their government than we have
in our country; it is very much like the method of RECALL that is used in some of our states.
At the same time, it assures a real executive leadership WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, a leadership
that is both responsive and responsible to the people.

GROWTH OF IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP

Not only does our Constitution fail to provide clearly for responsible leadership within the
government, but our system of "checks and balances," our party system of government, and the
organization and rules of Congress, all taken together, have tended to confuse our leadership,
and to impose upon us an irresponsible leadership, OUTSIDE of the government as outlined by
the Constitution. To understand this it will first be necessary to examine the organization
of Congress.

THE CONGRESS

Congress, like the state legislatures, consists of two chambers, the House of Representatives
and the Senate; this being another instance of "checks and balances."

The creation of two chambers in the Congress made possible a satisfactory settlement of a dispute
in the Constitutional Convention with regard to the basis of representation. The larger states
wanted representation proportional to their population, while the smaller states, insisted
upon EQUAL representation for all the states. It was settled that there should be equal representation
in the Senate, and proportional representation in the House of Representatives. This is one
of a series of compromises that had to be made between the two parties in the convention. In
fact, the Constitution is a series of compromises from beginning to end. Only thirty-nine of
the fifty-five delegates in the convention signed the Constitution, and it is probable that
no one even of the thirty-nine was wholly pleased with it.

THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The number of representatives in the first Congress from each state was fixed in the Constitution,
and provision made for a census in 1790 and every ten years thereafter, on the basis of which
a reapportionment should be made. At present there are 435 members of the House, one for about
every 212,000 of the population. They are elected by direct vote of the people, one from each
of the CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS into which each state is divided, and for a term of two years.

THE SENATE

There are two senators from each state. The Constitution provided that they were to be elected
by the state legislatures, another evidence of distrust of the people. In 1913, the seventeenth
amendment to the Constitution was enacted, providing for the election of senators by popular
vote, showing the growing spirit of democracy and the distrust of the state legislatures. Senators
are elected for six years, but the term of only one third of them expires at the same time,
so that at least two thirds of the Senate have always had at least two years' experience. No
citizen may become a senator until he is thirty years of age, while one may become a member
of the lower house at twenty-five.

EXCLUSIVE POWERS OF EACH HOUSE

The House of Representatives has one important power not possessed by the Senate: it alone
can originate bills for raising revenue. This is because the representatives were supposed
to be more directly representative of the people than the senators. However, the Senate may
amend such bills, and often succeeds in forcing the House to accept such radical amendments
as practically to destroy the advantage possessed by the latter in its power to originate the
bills.

In addition to its lawmaking powers, the Senate was intended to be an advisory council to the
President. Only with its "advice and consent" may the President make appointments and treaties.

cabinet government" as in England.

ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

The presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice-President of the United States, while that
of the House of Representatives is a SPEAKER elected by the House. The Vice-President has no
vote in the Senate except in case of a tie, when he may cast the deciding vote. The Speaker,
on the other hand, has all the rights of any other member and has large powers by virtue of
his position. He is always elected by a strictly party vote, and therefore represents the majority
party in the House.

THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM

As in the state legislatures, and for the same reason, most of the work of legislation in Congress
is done by standing committees, of which there are about sixty in the House and about seventy-five
in the Senate. As in the state legislatures, these committees are chosen on party lines, the
chairmen and the majority of the members always being of the majority party. The procedure
by which legislation is carried on in Congress is very much the same as that in the state legislatures,
and has the same advantages and disadvantages. There is even greater necessity for the committee
organization and for rules because of the vastly greater number of bills introduced. In a recent
Congress more than 33,000 bills were introduced in the House of Representatives alone. Whereas
in the state legislatures some of the rules of procedure are fixed by the state constitutions,
the rules of Congress are determined entirely by each house for itself. The committee on rules
in each house, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairmen of the committees
in both houses, may run things as they see fit. That this is done there is plenty of evidence,
such as the following words of a member of Congress:

You send important questions to a committee, you put into the hands of a few men the power
to bring in bills, and then they are brought in with an ironclad rule, and rammed down the
throats of members; and then those measures are sent out as being the deliberate judgment of
the Congress of the United States when no deliberate judgment has been expressed by any man.

DIFFUSED LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS

It is this procedure in Congress that causes leadership to become diffused, hidden, and often
to pass outside of the government altogether into the hands of "bosses" and special "interests."
There can be no well-conceived PLAN worked out by responsible leaders and approved by Congress
as a whole. There may be "plans," worked out by leaders in Congress, but they are likely to
be plans designed to serve party ends rather than to promote a well- thought-out program of
national development. Thousands of bills of the greatest variety are introduced by individual
members and handled by different committees acting independently of one another and often at
cross purposes.

RELATION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE AND LEGISTLATIVE BRANCHES

The legislative and executive branches of government are each extremely jealous of any encroachment
upon its powers by the other. It is not always easy to decide just where the dividing line
lies between the powers properly exercised by each. It is maintained on the one hand that Congress
is encroaching on the rightful domain of the executive; and at least it is true that while
it denies the President responsible leadership in determining the policies of the government,
it has failed to substitute any other responsible leadership, and has even made leadership
obscure. On the other hand, it is maintained that the executive encroaches upon the powers
of Congress. While this chapter was being written a member of the House of Representatives
made a speech in which he said:

This bill presents a fine specimen of bureaucratic legislation. [Footnote: "Bureaucratic legislation"
here means lawmaking by bureaus in the executive branch of the government.] If the Congress
ever intends, as it surely does, to regain the powers granted it by the fathers, of which it
is now temporarily deprived by bureaucratic encroachment, now is the time to start upon such
a campaign by defeating by a decisive majority the bill now offered for your consideration
... Every time you weaken Congress by the establishment of a bureau in which the authority
of Congress is lessened, you lay one more stone in the erection of the temple of autocracy
... These bureaus are not only legislating by administrative processes but are usurping the
power and prerogatives of the people's courts ...

THE DUTY OF CONGRESS TO WATCH THE EXECUTIVE

It is the business of the people's representatives in the law- making branch of government
not merely to make laws, but also to watch and control the executive. The great English philosopher,
John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), thus stated the purpose of the English House of Commons:

To watch and control the government; [Footnote: "Government" here refers to the executive branch.]
to throw the light of publicity on its acts; to compel a full explanation and justification
of all of them which any one considers questionable; to censure them if found condemnable;
to be at once the nation's committee on grievances; an arena in which not only the opinion
of the nation, but that of every section of it, and as far as possible, of every eminent individual
that it contains, can produce itself in full sight and challenge full discussion.

As we have seen, the English House of Commons has a way to control executive leadership without
destroying it. Even if we desired to do so, we could not adopt the English plan without changing
our Constitution. But there are ways in which the same result could in a measure be accomplished
without such change. One of these is by a well-organized BUDGET SYSTEM.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROPRIATIONS

The methods of making appropriations for the purposes of our national government have been
as unbusinesslike as in the states. Charges of extravagance and inefficiency have been made
freely, the blame being placed sometimes upon Congress and sometimes upon the executive departments.
Both are at fault; and the difficulty is that it is almost impossible to fix the responsibility
anywhere.

DUPLICATION AND CONFUSION IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

Although the national government, unlike the states, has a single- headed executive, the executive
departments are composed of a multitude of bureaus and other subdivisions that are not well
organized in their relations to one another. There is overlapping, duplication, and even conflict
of work. The director of finance of the War Department said that in the recent war,

The War Department entered this war without any fixed or carefully digested and prepared financial
system. There were at the beginning of the war five ... bureaus each independent of the others,
each making its own contracts, doing its own purchasing, doing its own accounting, with as
many different methods as there were bureaus. As a result they were competing with each other
in a market where the supplies in many cases for which they were competing were restricted
in amount ... There was no central authority to prune, revise, or compare estimates submitted
and to coordinate expenditures, and that naturally resulted in overlappings and duplications,
and some of them of a large amount. [Footnote: Testimony before Budget Committee, quoted by
Will Payne, "Your Budget," Saturday Evening Post, Jan. 3, 1920, p. 32.]

The responsibility is partly in the executive department; but it is also partly in Congress,
for it creates bureaus, defines their duties, appropriates money for them. And in Congress
the responsibility is divided among various committees.

One committee or subcommittee has supervision of building the barracks at a given army post
while another committee or subcommittee has supervision of building the hospital at the same
post. One committee has jurisdiction of the guns, another committee has jurisdiction of the
emplacement of the guns. All committees are jealous of their own prerogatives and sometimes
more or less jealous of other committees. The Secretary of the Treasury puts these estimates
together without revision and without criticism and submits them to Congress, together with
an estimate of the probable revenues available. While there is a committee on appropriations
in each house of Congress,

... one class of appropriations after another has been taken away from this committee and intrusted
to other committees until, as a result, the work of preparing appropriations in the House of
Representatives is broken up so that there are now no less than fourteen general appropriation
bills prepared by seven different committees ... In the preparation of their bills the committee
on appropriations and the other committees in charge of appropriations are really compelled
to work more or less blindly. Sometimes they hold extensive hearings endeavoring to get a complete
grasp of the multitudinous detailed expenditures for which they must provide. But, of course,
it is impossible for the several committees, in the time at their disposal, to give even minor
matters the amount of attention demanded by sound public economy. [Footnote: C. A. Beard, AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS, pp. 366, 367.]

THE PRINCIPLES OF A BUDGET SYSTEM

The first principles of a budget, according to students of government, are that it should be
prepared by the executive branch of the government, which is responsible for spending the money;
that it should be prepared by an agency responsible directly to the President, and with authority
to revise and adjust the estimates of the several departments in the light of the needs and
resources of the government as a whole; and that it should be based upon an accounting system
that will show clearly how efficiently each department and minor subdivision is doing its work.
As this chapter is being written, a bill is before Congress which, if passed, will more or
less completely accomplish these results.

THE NEED FOR CENTRALIZING APPROPRIATIONS

It remains for Congress, however, to make the appropriations requested in the budget, with
such modifications as may be shown to be wise. It is generally accepted that appropriations
cannot be wisely made under the present system, and that responsibility for them must be centered
in one committee in each house.

This change will necessitate a change in the rules which can only be made by each house for
itself. A resolution has been introduced in the House of Representatives recommending this
change, but it has not at this writing been acted upon.

In the English House of Commons, when the appropriation bill is introduced, the House becomes
in effect a court before which the prime minister and his cabinet are placed on trial to defend
their budget. The whole House is in session. The minority party, which conducts the opposition,
employs counsel, and by its searching inquiries compels the cabinet to explain and defend the
budget at every point. By this procedure the public is informed as to the work and program
of the government, and the executive leaders held strictly to account.

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITIZEN

A budget system, however good it may be, like all other governmental machinery is merely an
organization for team work, and will do very little good unless the team work is forthcoming,
not only among the various branches and departments of government, but also on the part of
the citizens.

If there is a real budget it has got to be your budget. It will be good, bad or indifferent
finally just in proportion to your interest in it and your expression of that interest at the
polls and elsewhere. If there is a good budget system--not on paper, but in actual practice--you've
got to make it. If, when a budget bill is finally enacted you say, "Well, that job is done,"
and dismiss it from your mind there will be no lasting gain ... [Footnote: Will Payne, "Your
Budget," SATURDAY EVENING POST January 3, 1920, p. 30.]

Effective control over government can be exercised only by PUBLIC OPINION and PUBLIC INTEREST.
We may have any kind of government we want, if we only want it badly enough, and only when
we want it badly enough. The blame for inefficiency and wastefulness on the part of government
at Washington, or at the state capital, or at the county seat, rests largely with the people
back home, who are either selfish or blind to the fact that the interests of the nation are
larger than their own or those of their own little community. The very people who talk most
loudly about the extravagance of government, or about the burden of taxes, are likely to be
the ones who expect most from their congressmen for purely personal or local advantage. They
are likely to judge their representative's fitness for his position more by his ability to
get funds from the public treasury for local gratification than by his attitude toward great
national questions.

Congress, and they are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Its sessions are held in the Capitol building at Washington. Congress has created circuit courts
of appeals, of which there are now nine, each "circuit" including several states; and district
courts, of which there is at least one in every state, and sometimes several. In addition to
these there is a court of customs appeals and a court of claims, for special classes of cases.
The courts of the District of Columbia are also United States courts, inasmuch as the District
is governed entirely by the national government. The judges of all United States courts are
appointed by the President and hold office for life.

POWERS OF THE FEDERAL COURTS

The powers of the federal courts are stated in Article III, section 2, of the Constitution.
In general, they have jurisdiction over cases of a national or interstate character. Most cases
that come in the first instance before the federal courts are tried in the United States district
courts, going to the higher courts only on appeal; but there are certain classes of cases that
go to the Supreme Court at once (Art. III, sec. 2, cl. 2). A case brought to trial before a
state court may be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States when the Constitution,
the laws, or the treaties of the United States are involved, and its decision is final. The
Supreme Court may declare a law passed by Congress or an act of the President null and void
if, in its opinion, such law or act is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. It has
been questioned whether the framers of the Constitution intended the Supreme Court to have
this power, but it exercises the power on the ground that the Constitution is the supreme law
of the land to which even Congress and the President are subject, and that it is the sacred
duty of the courts to preserve it from violation. We have noted the influence exercised by
the Supreme Court in extending the activities of the United States government by its broad
interpretations of the Constitution.
