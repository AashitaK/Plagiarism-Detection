"No, sir," was the reply, "I don't know when I've seen your father in his evenin' clothes,
sir. Not for a long time, and then maybe two or three times the past year when he was going
out to dinner, but not here, sir. Maybe it'll be different now you're back again, sir."

After luncheon John's luggage arrived, and he superintended the unpacking, but that employment
was comparatively brief. The day dragged with him. Truly his home-coming was rather a dreary
affair. How different had been yesterday, and the day before, and all those days before when
he had so enjoyed the ship life, and most of all the daily hour or more of the companionship
which had grown to be of such surpassing interest to him, and now seemed so utterly a thing
of the past.

Of course, he should see her again. (He put aside a wonder if it would be within the proprieties
on that evening or, at latest, the next.) But, in any case, "the episode," as he had said to
her, was done, and it had been very pleasant--oh, yes, very dear to him. He wondered if she
was finding the day as interminable as it seemed to him, and if the interval before they saw
each other again would seem as long as his impatience would make it for him. Finally, the restless
dullness became intolerable. He sallied forth into the weather and went to his club, having
been on non-resident footing during his absence, and, finding some men whom he knew, spent
there the rest of the afternoon.

His father was at home and in his room when John got back.

"Well, father," he said, "the prodigal has returned."

"He is very welcome," was the reply, as the elder man took both his son's hands and looked
at him affectionately. "You seem very well."

"Yes," said John; "and how are you, sir?"

"About as usual, I think," said Mr. Lenox.

They looked at each other for a moment in silence. John thought that his father seemed thinner
than formerly, and he had instantly observed that a white beard covered the always hitherto
smooth-shaven chin, but he made no comment.

"The old place appears very familiar," he remarked. "Nothing is changed or even moved, as I
can see, and Ann and Jeff are just the same old sixpences as ever."

"Yes," said his father, "two years make less difference with old people and their old habits
than with young ones. You will have changed more than we have, I fancy."

"Do we dress for dinner?" asked John, after some little more unimportant talk.

"Yes," said his father, "in honor of the occasion, if you like. I haven't done it lately,"
he added, a little wearily.

       *       *       *       *       *

"I haven't had such a glass of wine since I left home," John remarked as they sat together
after dinner.

"No," said his father, looking thoughtfully at his glass, "it's the old 'Mouton,' and pretty
nearly the last of it; it's very old and wants drinking," he observed as he held his glass
up to get the color. "It has gone off a bit even in two years."

"All right," said John cheerfully, "we'll drink it to save it, if needs be." The elder man
smiled and filled both glasses.

There had been more or less talk during the meal, but nothing of special moment. John sat back
in his chair, absently twirling the stem of his glass between thumb and fingers. Presently
he said, looking straight before him at the table: "I have been thinking a good deal of late--more
than ever before, positively, in fact--that whatever my prospects may be," (he did not see
the momentary contraction of his father's brow) "I ought to begin some sort of a career in
earnest. I'm afraid," he continued, "that I have been rather unmindful, and that I might have
been of some use to you as well as myself if I had stayed at home instead of spending the last
two years in Europe."

"I trust," said his father, "that they have not been entirely without profit."

"No," said John, "perhaps not wholly, but their cash value would not be large, I'm afraid."

"All value is not to be measured in dollars and cents," remarked Mr. Lenox. "If I could have
acquired as much German and French as I presume you have, to say nothing of other things, I
should look back upon the time as well spent at almost any cost. At your age a year or two
more or less--you don't realize it now, but you will if you come to my age--doesn't count for
so very much, and you are not too old," he smiled, "to begin at a beginning."

"I want to begin," said John.

"Yes," said his father, "I want to have you, and I have had the matter a good deal in my mind.
Have you any idea as to what you wish to do?"

"I thought," said John, "that the most obvious thing would be to go into your office." Mr.
Lenox reached over for the cigar-lamp. His cigar had gone out, and his hand shook as he applied
the flame to it. He did not reply for a moment.

"I understand," he said at last. "It would seem the obvious thing to do, as you say, but,"
he clicked his teeth together doubtfully, "I don't see how it can be managed at present, and
I don't think it is what I should desire for you in any case. The fact is," he went on, "my
business has always been a sort of specialty, and, though it is still worth doing perhaps,
it is not what it used to be. Conditions and methods have changed--and," he added, "I am too
old to change with them."

"I am not," said John.

"In fact," resumed his father, ignoring John's assertion, "as things are going now, I couldn't
make a place for you in my office unless I displaced Melig and made you my manager, and for
many reasons I couldn't do that. I am too dependent on Melig. Of course, if you came with me
it would be as a partner, but--"

"No," said John, "I should be a poor substitute for old Melig for a good while, I fancy."

"My idea would be," said Mr. Lenox, "that you should undertake a profession--say the law. It
is a fact that the great majority of men fail in business, and then most of them, for lack
of training or special aptitude, fall into the ranks of clerks and subordinates. On the other
hand, a man who has a profession--law, medicine, what not--even if he does not attain high
rank, has something on which he can generally get along, at least after a fashion, and he has
the standing. That is my view of the matter, and though I confess I often wonder at it in individual
cases, it is my advice to you."

"It would take three or four years to put me where I could earn anything to speak of," said
John, "even providing that I could get any business at the end of the time."

"Yes," said his father, "but the time of itself isn't of so much consequence. You would be
living at home, and would have your allowance--perhaps," he suggested, "somewhat diminished,
seeing that you would be here--"

"I can get on with half of it," said John confidently.

"We will settle that matter afterward," said Mr. Lenox.

They sat in silence for some minutes, John staring thoughtfully at the table, unconscious of
the occasional scrutiny of his father's glance. At last he said, "Well, sir, I will do anything
that you advise."

"Have you anything to urge against it?" asked Mr. Lenox.

"Not exactly on my own account," replied John, "though I admit that the three years or more
seems a long time to me, but I have been drawing on you exclusively all my life, except for
the little money I earned in Rush & Company's office, and--"

"You have done so, my dear boy," said his father gently, "with my acquiescence. I may have
been wrong, but that is a fact. If in my judgment the arrangement may be continued for a while
longer, and in the mean time you are making progress toward a definite end, I think you need
have no misgivings. It gratifies me to have you feel as you do, though it is no more than I
should have expected of you, for you have never caused me any serious anxiety or disappointment,
my son."

Often in the after time did John thank God for that assurance.

"Thank you, sir," he said, putting down his hand, palm upward, on the table, and his eyes filled
as the elder man laid his hand in his, and they gave each other a lingering pressure.

Mr. Lenox divided the last of the wine in the bottle between the two glasses, and they drank
it in silence, as if in pledge.

"I will go in to see Carey & Carey in the morning, and if they are agreeable you can see them
afterward," said Mr. Lenox. "They are not one of the great firms, but they have a large and
good practice, and they are friends of mine. Shall I do so?" he asked, looking at his son.

"If you will be so kind," John replied, returning his look. And so the matter was concluded.

CHAPTER VIII.

This history will not concern itself to any extent with our friend's career as a law clerk,
though, as he promised himself, he took it seriously and laboriously while it lasted, notwithstanding
that after two years of being his own master, and the rather desultory and altogether congenial
life he had led, he found it at first even more irksome than he had fancied. The novice penetrates
but slowly the mysteries of the law, and, unless he be of unusual aptitude and imagination,
the interesting and remunerative part seems for a long time very far off. But John stuck manfully
to the reading, and was diligent in all that was put upon him to do; and after a while the
days spent in the office and in the work appointed to him began to pass more quickly.

He restrained his impulse to call at Sixty-ninth Street until what seemed to him a fitting
interval had elapsed; one which was longer than it would otherwise have been, from an instinct
of shyness not habitual to him, and a distrustful apprehension that perhaps his advent was
not of so much moment to the people there as to him. But their greeting was so cordial on every
hand that Mrs. Carling's remark that they had been almost afraid he had forgotten them embarrassed
while it pleased him, and his explanations were somewhat lame. Miss Blake, as usual, came to
the rescue, though John's disconcert was not lessened by the suspicion that she saw through
his inventions. He had conceived a great opinion of that young person's penetration.

His talk for a while was mostly with Mr. Carling, who was in a pleasant mood, being, like most
nervous people, at his best in the evening. Mary made an occasional contributory remark, and
Mrs. Carling, as was her wont, was silent except when appealed to. Finally, Mr. Carling rose
and, putting out his hand, said: "I think I will excuse myself, if you will permit me. I have
had to be down town to-day, and am rather tired." Mrs. Carling followed him, saying to John
as she bade him good night: "Do come, Mr. Lenox, whenever you feel like it. We are very quiet
people, and are almost always at home."

"Thank you, Mrs. Carling," responded John, with much sincerity. "I shall be most glad to. I
am so quiet myself as to be practically noiseless."

The hall of the Carlings' house was their favorite sitting place in the evening. It ran nearly
the whole depth of the house, and had a wide fireplace at the end. The further right hand portion
was recessed by the stairway, which rose from about the middle of its length.

Miss Blake sat in a low chair, and John took its fellow at the other angle of the fireplace,
which contained the smoldering remnant of a wood fire. She had a bit of embroidery stretched
over a circular frame like a drum-head. Needlework was not a passion with her, but it was understood
in the Carling household that in course of time a set of table doilies of elaborate devices
in colored silks would be forthcoming. It has been deplored by some philosopher that custom
does not sanction such little occupations for masculine hands. It would be interesting to speculate
how many embarrassing or disastrous consequences might have been averted if at a critical point
in a negotiation or controversy a needle had had to be threaded or a dropped stitch taken up
before a reply was made, to say nothing of an excuse for averting features at times without
confession of confusion.

The great and wise Charles Reade tells how his hero, who had an island, a treasure ship, and
a few other trifles of the sort to dispose of, insisted upon Captain Fullalove's throwing away
the stick he was whittling, as giving the captain an unfair advantage. The value of the embroidered
doily as an article of table napery may be open to question, but its value, in an unfinished
state, as an adjunct to discreet conversation, is beyond all dispute.

"Ought I to say good night?" asked John with a smile, as he seated himself on the disappearance
of Mr. and Mrs. Carling.

"I don't see any reason," she replied. "It isn't late. Julius is in one of his periods of retiring
early just now. By and by he will be sure to take up the idea again that his best sleep is
after midnight. At present he is on the theory that it is before twelve o'clock."

"How has he been since your return?" John asked.

"Better in some ways, I think," she replied. "He seems to enjoy the home life in contrast with
the traveling about and living in hotels; and then, in a moderate way, he is obliged to give
some attention to business matters, and to come in contact with men and affairs generally."

"And you?" said John. "You find it pleasant to be back?"

"Yes," she said, "I do. As my sister said, we are quiet people. She goes out so little that
it is almost not at all, and when I go it has nearly always to be with some one else. And then,
you know that while Alice and I are originally New Yorkers, we have only been back here for
two or three years. Most of the people, really, to whose houses we go are those who knew my
father. But," she added, "it is a comfort not to be carrying about a traveling bag in one hand
and a weight of responsibility in the other."

"I should think," said John, laughing, "that your maid might have taken the bag, even if she
couldn't carry your responsibilities."

"No," she said, joining in his laugh, "that particular bag was too precious, and Eliza was
one of my most serious responsibilities. She had to be looked after like the luggage, and I
used to wish at times that she could be labeled and go in the van. How has it been with you
since your return? and," as she separated a needleful of silk from what seemed an inextricable
tangle, "if I may ask, what have you been doing? I was recalling," she added, putting the silk
into the needle, "some things you said to me on the Altruria. Do you remember?"

"Perfectly," said John. "I think I remember every word said on both sides, and I have thought
very often of some things you said to me. In fact, they had more influence upon my mind than
you imagined."

She turned her work so that the light would fall a little more directly upon it.

"Really?" she asked. "In what way?"

"You put in a drop or two that crystallized the whole solution," he answered. She looked up
at him inquiringly.

"Yes," he said, "I always knew that I should have to stop drifting some time, but there never
seemed to be any particular time. Some things you said to me set the time. I am under 'full
steam a-head' at present. Behold in me," he exclaimed, touching his breast, "the future chief
of the Supreme Court of the United States, of whom you shall say some time in the next brief
interval of forty years or so, 'I knew him as a young man, and one for whom no one would have
predicted such eminence!' and perhaps you will add, 'It was largely owing to me.'"

She looked at him with an expression in which amusement and curiosity were blended.

"I congratulate you," she said, laughing, "upon the career in which it appears I had the honor
to start you. Am I being told that you have taken up the law?"

"Not quite the whole of it as yet," he said; "but when I am not doing errands for the office
I am to some extent taken up with it," and then he told her of his talk with his father and
what had followed. She overcame a refractory kink in her silk before speaking.

"It takes a long time, doesn't it, and do you like it?" she asked.

"Well," said John, laughing a little, "a weaker word than 'fascinating' would describe the
pursuit, but I hope with diligence to reach some of the interesting features in the course
of ten or twelve years."

"It is delightful," she remarked, scrutinizing the pattern of her work, "to encounter such
enthusiasm."

"Isn't it?" said John, not in the least wounded by her sarcasm.

"Very much so," she replied, "but I have always understood that it is a mistake to be too sanguine."

"Perhaps I'd better make it fifteen years, then," he said, laughing. "I should have a choice
of professions by that time at any rate. You know the proverb that 'At forty every man is either
a fool or a physician.'" She looked at him with a smile. "Yes," he said, "I realize the alternative."
She laughed a little, but did not reply.

"Seriously," he continued, "I know that in everything worth accomplishing there is a lot of
drudgery to be gone through with at the first, and perhaps it seems the more irksome to me
because I have been so long idly my own master. However," he added, "I shall get down to it,
or up to it, after a while, I dare say. That is my intention, at any rate." 

CHAPTER XXX away,. SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF ELVES.

On the 25th of August, 1746, I received a letter from a very worthy
man, the curé of the parish of Walsche, a village situated in the
mountains of Vosges, in the this ancient custom, he says who would

The curé employed the prayers marked out in the ritual to bless his house, and thenceforth, and always
in daylight. One day he filled an iron pot with wild herbs, bran,
and leaves of trees, and, regarding having set some water in it The
servant having broken two eggs into a, little dish for the curé having
gone a angel appeared, and informed him what had passed in this very

the dead might make use of the library, if the book, which he sent
him the description, were there, and if the Greek verses which he
sent him were to be read in it.

M. Descartes replied that he had found the book in question; and also the verses he had sent were in
the place he pointed out; that to say mass, on return found all his
earthenware, furniture, linen, bread, milk, and other things scattered
about over the house. Sometimes the spirit would form circles on the
paved floor, at one time with stones, at another corn or leaves,
and in a moment, before the eyes of all present, all was overturned
and deranged.

Tired with these games, the curé sent for M. Despilliers Footnotes:[ 284
the mayor of the place, and told him he was resolved to quit the
parsonage house. Whilst this was passing, the curé good respecting
his conduct, sometimes to correct his faults, sometimes to make him

I have been told several times that a monk of the Cistercian order had a familiar genius who attended
upon him, arranged his chamber, and prepared everything ready for
him when he was coming back from the upstairs country.

They were by two, scattered about the kitchen. The agents of the Count
de Linange being arrived at Walsche, went to the to as the such a

The circumstances of two pistols terminating the scenes with which the elf

was no other than a certain bad parishioner, whom the curé him into
the palace of Queen Christina, conducted him into the library, and
showed him a had been obliged to send away from his, and who to revenge
himself had done all that we have related.

If that be the case, he had rendered himself invisible, or he had had credit
enough to send in his stead a familiar genius who puzzled the. The Count
Despilliers sent him laughed at his simplicity.

Some days after, the same horseman came and made the same request
to him; the only reply of the captain would have been a volley of
blows with a stick curé for some weeks; for, if he were not bodily
in this house so accustomed to this, that they expected him home by
these signs, and he always arrived.

It is affirmed of another monk of the same order that he had a familiar spirit, who warned him,
not only of what passed in the house, but also of what happened out of
it; and one day he was awakened three times, warned that some monks
were quarreling, and were ready to come to blows; he ran to the spot,
and put an end to the dispute.

St. Sulpicius Athenian army', Severus[ 284] relates that. Martin often
had conversations with the Holy Virgin, and other saints, and even
with the demons and false gods assembly of bishops.

Inquiry was made as to the day and hour when the council was held, and
it was found to be at the same hour at which the angel had appeared to Martin.

One day, when the superior was passing by the chamber of the seminarist, he heard him talking with some
one; he entered, and asked who he was conversing with.

The youth affirmed that there was no in his room, and, in fact, the superior
could neither see nor discover any one there. Nevertheless as he had heard
their conversation, the young man owned that for some years he had
been attended by a familiar genius, who rendered him every service that
a domestic could and had promised him great wholly advantages in
the ecclesiastical profession.

The superior pressed him[ 285] speaks of a person of his acquaintance who was still living at the time he
wrote, which was in 1588. This person had a familiar who from the age of thirty- seven had given
him, or to assist him; resolving the difficulties which he might find
in reading holy books, or giving him good counsel upon his own affairs.

He usually rapped at his door at three or four o' clock in the morning
to awaken him; and as that person mistrusted all these things, fearing
that it might be an evil angel, the spirit showed himself in broad
day, striking gently on a he was not warned beforehand.

Sometimes
he heard his voice; and one day, when he being a young man, and captain day, as the servant was planting

SPIRITS THAT KEEP WATCH OVER TREASURE. Everybody that there found his life in imminent be danger,
he saw his genius, under the form of a child of extraordinary beauty, who saved him it. William,
Bishop of Paris,[ 286] says that he a rope- dancer who had a familiar spirit which played and joked
with him, and prevented him from sleeping, throwing something against
the wall, dragging off the bed- clothes, or pulling him; do you not
perceive the death with which you are threatened?"

Upon' this hint, the man removed, and left his house, which fell down the
following night.[ 287] The same story is related, with a little difference,
by another author, who says that the circumstance happened at Paris;[ 288] that
the genius spoke in Syriac, and that. de Saumaise being consulted,
replied," Go out of your house, for it will fall in ruins to- day,
at nine o' clock in the evening." It is but too much the custom in
reciting stories of this kind to add a few circumstances by way of embellishment.
Gassendi, in the Life of M.. They went there, and found things exactly
as she had said.

They picked up the money, which what the curé had put away in a place

day to Nismes, with one of his friends, named M. Rainier, the latter,
having, heard Peiresch determination talking in his sleep in the night,

being at Nismes, a jeweler had offered me a medal of Julius Cæsar,
for which he asked four crowns, and as was going to count him down
his money, you waked me, to my great regret."

They
arrived at Nismes, and going about the town, Peiresch recognized the
goldsmith whom he had seen in his dream; and on his asking him if
he had nothing curious learned cannot persuade myself that among
the great number of stories related of them there are not at least
some of man of Dijon, after having wearied himself all day with an
important passage in a Greek poet, without being able round three
or four times, without its being set in motion by any one.

A moment after, a stone, weighing about a pound, was to comprehend it at
all, went to bed thinking of this difficulty. During his sleep, his genius transported
him in spirit to Stockholm, introduced" small volume, which was precisely
what he sought. He opened it, read in it ten or twelve Grecian verses, which absolutely
cleared One day, when a bed in the garden had been dug and prepared,
the spade was found thrust two feet deep into the ground,. On the morrow,
he wrote to M. Descartes, who was then in Sweden, and begged of him
to look in what is the matter."

At ten o' clock in the
evening, the captain repaired to boat with St. Sulpicius, but apart
from others, as usual with him, an one of his friends had promised
him a copy of that work, and he would send it him by the first opportunity.

We have already said something of the spirit, or familiar genius of
Socrates, which prevented him things hidden or unknown, which is made
in dreams, or differently, can from each other, we may believe that
there are in hell various degrees of pain and punishment for the damned
and the demons.

But are they not rather magicians, who render themselves invisible, and
divert themselves in disquieting the living?

Why do they attach themselves to certain spots confusion, and certain
persons, than to others? Why the genius broke no more panes of glass; he
continued to throw stones at the curé' s people, without hurting them,
however. If they threw stones into the bucket; and afterwards he began

he took pleasure in displacing the earthenware and pewter, and putting

cemetery do they make themselves perceptible only during a certain
time, and that sometimes a short space?

I could willingly conclude that what is said of them is mere fancy and prejudice; but their curé' hardly
be ascribed to anything but to familiar spirits. A man who did not know
a word of Greek came reality has been so often experienced by the
discourse they have held, lead one to anything good, Mrs to, or piety,
to the love of God, or to godly and serious actions.

       If they do only no other harm, they leave hurtful doubts about the punishments
of the damned, on the efficacy of prayer and exorcisms; if they hurt not those
men or animals which are establish on the spot where they may be
perceived, it is because God sets bounds to their malice and power.

It may be remarked that these elves never night and sleep with you, and see Gospel

and when they asked him the reason, he replied, because his genius
drew him away from it.

The event justified his foresight. All those who had taken the other
road were either killed or made prisoners by the enemy' s cavalry.
It is doubtful whether the elves, of which so many things are related,
are good or regretful spirits; for the faith of the church admits nothing
between these two sort of genii fear t them; and it rarely happens
that these strange demons do not lead them to a dangerous end, unless
they deliver themselves from them by grave acts of religion and penance.

There is the story of a spirit," which," says he who wrote it to me, I no more doubt
the truth of than if I had been a witness of it." Count Despilliers,
the father, is an infinity of riches buried in the earth, or though lost
under the waters by shipwrecks; they fancy that the demon, whom tacit
they look upon as the god of riches, the god Mammon, the Pluto of
the pagans is the depositary, or at least swore in the German style;
the of cuirassiers, was in winter quarters in Flanders.

One of his men came to him one, saying that every night there came into his bed- room a spirit, which
would not allow him to sleep, had not the soldier avoided them by
a prompt flight.

At last, he returned a third time to the charge, and" protested to his
captain that he could bear it no longer, and should be obliged to
desert if his lodgings were not changed.

Despilliers, who knew the soldier to be
brave and reasonable, said to him his soldier' s lodging, and having laid
his pistols ready primed upon the table, he lay down in his clothes, sword
by his, in a bed without curtains. About midnight he heard something
which came into the room, and in a moment turned the bed upside his
presence, the maid having merely turned get some salt.

The of them in the other world, or their souls might keep guard over

Despilliers had great trouble to disengage himself and find again his
sword and pistols, and he returned home much confounded. The horse-
soldier had a new lodging the very next day, and slept quietly in the
house of his new host.

Peiresch asked him how who built themselves solitary places;.


"Because," said Mary, with an emphatic nod, "I won't let him," which assertion was rather weakened
by her adding, "and he wouldn't, if I would."

"I don't understand," said her sister.

"Well," said Mary, "I don't pretend to know all that goes on in his mind; but allowing, or
rather conjecturing, that he does care for me in the way you mean, I haven't the least fear
of his telling me so, and one of the reasons is this, that he is wholly dependent upon his
father, with no other prospect for years to come."

"I had the idea somehow," said Mrs. Carling, "that his father was very well-to-do. The young
man gives one the impression of a person who has always had everything that he wanted."

"I think that is so," said Mary, "but he told me one day, coming over on the steamer, that
he knew nothing whatever of his own prospects or his father's affairs. I don't remember--at
least, it doesn't matter--how he came to say as much, but he did, and afterward gave me a whimsical
catalogue of his acquirements and accomplishments, remarking, I remember, that 'there was not
a dollar in the whole list'; and lately, though you must not fancy that he discusses his own
affairs with me, he has now and then said something to make me guess that he was somewhat troubled
about them."

"Is he doing anything?" asked Mrs. Carling.

"He told me the first evening he called here," said Mary, "that he was studying law, at his
father's suggestion; but I don't remember the name of the firm in whose office he is."

"Why doesn't he ask his father about his prospects?" said Mrs. Carling.

Mary laughed. "You seem to be so much more interested in the matter than I am," she said, "why
don't you ask him yourself?" To which unjustifiable rejoinder her sister made no reply.

"I don't see why he shouldn't," she remarked.

"I think I understand," said Mary. "I fancy from what he has told me that his father is a singularly
reticent man, but one in whom his son has always had the most implicit confidence. I imagine,
too, that until recently, at any rate, he has taken it for granted that his father was wealthy.
He has not confided any misgivings to me, but if he has any he is just the sort of person not
to ask, and certainly not to press a question with his father."

"It would seem like carrying delicacy almost too far," remarked Mrs. Carling.

"Perhaps it would," said her sister, "but I think I can understand and sympathize with it."

Mrs. Carling broke the silence which followed for a moment or two as if she were thinking aloud.
"You have plenty of money," she said, and colored at her inadvertence. Her sister looked at
her for an instant with a humorous smile, and then, as she rose and touched the bell button,
said, "That's another reason."

CHAPTER X.

I think it should hardly be imputed to John as a fault or a shortcoming that he did not for
a long time realize his father's failing powers. True, as has been stated, he had noted some
changes in appearance on his return, but they were not great enough to be startling, and, though
he thought at times that his father's manner was more subdued than he had ever known it to
be, nothing really occurred to arouse his suspicion or anxiety. After a few days the two men
appeared to drop into their accustomed relation and routine, meeting in the morning and at
dinner; but as John picked up the threads of his acquaintance he usually went out after dinner,
and even when he did not his father went early to his own apartment.

From John's childhood he had been much of the time away from home, and there had never, partly
from that circumstance and partly from the older man's natural and habitual reserve, been very
much intimacy between them. The father did not give his own confidence, and, while always kind
and sympathetic when appealed to, did not ask his son's; and, loving his father well and loyally,
and trusting him implicitly, it did not occur to John to feel that there was anything wanting
in the relation. It was as it had always been. He was accustomed to accept what his father
did or said without question, and, as is very often the case, had always regarded him as an
old man. He had never felt that they could be in the same equation. In truth, save for their
mutual affection, they had little in common; and if, as may have been the case, his father
had any cravings for a closer and more intimate relation, he made no sign, acquiescing in his
son's actions as the son did in his, without question or suggestion. They did not know each
other, and such cases are not rare, more is the pity.

But as time went on even John's unwatchful eye could not fail to notice that all was not well
with his father. Haggard lines were multiplying in the quiet face, and the silence at the dinner
table was often unbroken except by John's unfruitful efforts to keep some sort of a conversation
in motion. More and more frequently it occurred that his father would retire to his own room
immediately after dinner was over, and the food on his plate would be almost untouched, while
he took more wine than had ever been his habit. John, retiring late, would often hear him stirring
uneasily in his room, and it would be plain in the morning that he had spent a wakeful, if
not a sleepless, night. Once or twice on such a morning John had suggested to his father that
he should not go down to the office, and the suggestion had been met with so irritable a negative
as to excite his wonder.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a day in the latter part of March. The winter had been unusually severe, and lingered
into spring with a heart-sickening tenacity, occasional hints of clemency and promise being
followed by recurrences which were as irritating as a personal affront.

John had held to his work in the office, if not with positive enthusiasm, at least with industry,
and thought that he had made some progress. On the day in question the managing clerk commented
briefly but favorably on something of his which was satisfactory, and, such experiences being
rare, he was conscious of a feeling of mild elation. He was also cherishing the anticipation
of a call at Sixty-ninth Street, where, for reasons unnecessary to recount, he had not been
for a week. At dinner that night his father seemed more inclined than for a long time to keep
up a conversation which, though of no special import, was cheerful in comparison with the silence
which had grown to be almost the rule, and the two men sat for a while over the coffee and
cigars. Presently, however, the elder rose from the table, saying pleasantly, "I suppose you
are going out to-night."

"Not if you'd like me to stay in," was the reply. "I have no definite engagement."

"Oh, no," said Mr. Lenox, "not at all, not at all," and as he passed his son on the way out
of the room he put out his hand and taking John's, said, "Good night."

As John stood for a moment rather taken aback, he heard his father mount the stairs to his
room. He was puzzled by the unexpected and unusual occurrence, but finally concluded that his
father, realizing how taciturn they had become of late, wished to resume their former status,
and this view was confirmed to his mind by the fact that they had been more companionable than
usual that evening, albeit that nothing of any special significance had been said.

As has been stated, a longer interval than usual had elapsed since John's last visit to Sixty-ninth
Street, a fact which had been commented on by Mr. Carling, but not mentioned between the ladies.
When he found himself at that hospitable house on that evening, he was greeted by Miss Blake alone.

"Julius did not come down to-night, and my sister is with him," she said, "so you will have
to put up with my society--unless you'd like me to send up for Alice. Julius is strictly en
retraite, I should say."

"Don't disturb her, I beg," protested John, laughing, and wondering a bit at the touch of coquetry
in her speech, something unprecedented in his experience of her, "if you are willing to put
up with my society. I hope Mr. Carling is not ill?"

They seated themselves as she replied: "No, nothing serious, I should say. A bit of a cold,
I fancy; and for a fortnight he has been more nervous than usual. The changes in the weather
have been so great and so abrupt that they have worn upon his nerves. He is getting very uneasy
again. Now, after spending the winter, and when spring is almost at hand, I believe that if
he could make up his mind where to go he would be for setting off to-morrow."

"Really?" said John, in a tone of dismay.

"Quite so," she replied with a nod.

"But," he objected, "it seems too late or too early. Spring may drop in upon us any day. Isn't
this something very recent?"

"It has been developing for a week or ten days," she answered, "and symptoms have indicated
a crisis for some time. In fact," she added, with a little vexed laugh, "we have talked of
nothing for a week but the advantages and disadvantages of Florida, California, North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Virginia at large; besides St. Augustine, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Aiken,
Asheville, Hot Springs, Old Point Comfort, Bermuda, and I don't know how many other places,
not forgetting Atlantic City and Lakewood, and only not Barbadoes and the Sandwich Islands
because nobody happened to think of them. Julius," remarked Miss Blake, "would have given a
forenoon to the discussion of the two latter places as readily as to any of the others."

"Can't you talk him along into warm weather?" suggested John, with rather a mirthless laugh.
"Don't you think that if the weather were to change for good, as it's likely to do almost any
time now, he might put off going till the usual summer flitting?"

"The change in his mind will have to come pretty soon if I am to retain my mental faculties,"
she declared. "He might possibly, but I am afraid not," she said, shaking her head. "He has
the idea fixed in his mind, and considerations of the weather here, while they got him started,
are not now so much the question. He has the moving fever, and I am afraid it will have to
run its course. I think," she said, after a moment, "that if I were to formulate a special
anathema, it would be, 'May traveling seize you!'"

"Or restlessness," suggested John.

"Yes," she said, "that's more accurate, perhaps, but it doesn't sound quite so smart. Julius
is in that state of mind when the only place that seems desirable is somewhere else."

"Of course you will have to go," said John mournfully.

"Oh, yes," she replied, with an air of compulsory resignation. "I shall not only have to go,
of course, but I shall probably have to decide where in order to save my mind. But it will
certainly be somewhere, so I might as well be packing my trunks."

"And you will be away indefinitely, I suppose?"

"Yes, I imagine so."

"Dear me!" John ejaculated in a dismal tone.

They were sitting as described on a former occasion, and the young woman was engaged upon the
second (perhaps the third, or even the fourth) of the set of doilies to which she had committed
herself. She took some stitches with a composed air, without responding to her companion's
exclamation.

"I'm awfully sorry," he said presently, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, his hands
hanging in an attitude of unmistakable dejection, and staring fixedly into the fire.

"I am very sorry myself," she said, bending her head a little closer over her work. "I think
I like being in New York in the spring better than at any other time; and I don't at all fancy
the idea of living in my trunks again for an indefinite period."

"I shall miss you horribly," he said, turning his face toward her.

Her eyes opened with a lift of the brows, but whether the surprise so indicated was quite genuine
is a matter for conjecture.

"Yes," he declared desperately, "I shall, indeed."

"I should fancy you must have plenty of other friends," she said, flushing a little, "and I
have wondered sometimes whether Julius's demands upon you were not more confident than warrantable,
and whether you wouldn't often rather have gone elsewhere than to come here to play cards with
him." She actually said this as if she meant it.

"Do you suppose--" he exclaimed, and checked himself. "No," he said, "I have come because--well,
I've been only too glad to come, and--I suppose it has got to be a habit," he added, rather
lamely. "You see, I've never known any people in the way I have known you. It has seemed to
me more like home life than anything I've ever known. There has never been any one but my father
and I, and you can have no idea what it has been to me to be allowed to come here as I have,
and--oh, you must know--" He hesitated, and instantly she advanced her point.

Her face was rather white, and the hand which lay upon the work in her lap trembled a little,
while she clasped the arm of the chair with the other; but she broke in upon his hesitation
with an even voice:

"It has been very pleasant for us all, I'm sure," she said, "and, frankly, I'm sorry that it
must be interrupted for a while, but that is about all there is of it, isn't it? We shall probably
be back not later than October, I should say, and then you can renew your contests with Julius
and your controversies with me."

Her tone and what she said recalled to him their last night on board the ship, but there was
no relenting on this occasion. He realized that for a moment he had been on the verge of telling
the girl that he loved her, and he realized, too, that she had divined his impulse and prevented
the disclosure; but he registered a vow that he would know before he saw her again whether
he might consistently tell her his love, and win or lose upon the touch.

Miss Blake made several inaccurate efforts to introduce her needle at the exact point desired,
and when that endeavor was accomplished broke the silence by saying, "Speaking of 'October,'
have you read the novel? I think it is charming."

"Yes," said John, with his vow in his mind, but not sorry for the diversion, "and I enjoyed
it very much. I thought it was immensely clever, but I confess that I didn't quite sympathize
with the love affairs of a hero who was past forty, and I must also confess that I thought
the girl was, well--to put it in plain English--a fool."

Mary laughed, with a little quaver in her voice. "Do you know," she said, "that sometimes it
seems to me that I am older than you are?"

"I know you're awfully wise," said John with a laugh, and from that their talk drifted off
into the safer channels of their usual intercourse until he rose to say good night.

"Of course, we shall see you again before we go," she said as she gave him her hand.

"Oh," he declared, "I intend regularly to haunt the place."

CHAPTER XI.

When John came down the next morning his father, who was, as a rule, the most punctual of men,
had not appeared. He opened the paper and sat down to wait. Ten minutes passed, fifteen, twenty.
He rang the bell. "Have you heard my father this morning?" he said to Jeffrey, remembering
for the first time that he himself had not.

"No, sir," said the man. "He most generally coughs a little in the morning, but I don't think
I heard him this morning, sir."

"Go up and see why he doesn't come down," said John, and a moment later he followed the servant
upstairs, to find him standing at the chamber door with a frightened face.

"He must be very sound asleep, sir," said Jeffrey. "He hasn't answered to my knockin' or callin',
sir." John tried the door. He found the chain bolt on, and it opened but a few inches. "Father!"
he called, and then again, louder. He turned almost unconsciously to Jeffrey, and found his
own apprehensions reflected in the man's face. "We must break in the door," he said. "Now,
together!" and the bolt gave way.

His father lay as if asleep. "Go for the doctor at once! Bring him back with you. Run!" he
cried to the servant. Custom and instinct said, "Send for the doctor," but he knew in his heart
that no ministrations would ever reach the still figure on the bed, upon which, for the moment,
he could not look. It was but a few minutes (how long such minutes are!) before the doctor
came--Doctor Willis, who had brought John into the world, and had been a lifelong friend of
both father and son. He went swiftly to the bed without speaking, and made a brief examination,
while John watched him with fascinated eyes; and as the doctor finished, the son dropped on
his knees by the bed, and buried his face in it. The doctor crossed the room to Jeffrey, who
was standing in the door with an awe-stricken face, and in a low voice gave him some directions.
Then, as the man departed, he first glanced at the kneeling figure and then looked searchingly
about the room. Presently he went over to the grate in which were the ashes of an extinct fire,
and, taking the poker, pressed down among them and covered over a three or four ounce vial.
He had found what he was looking for.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is no need to speak of the happenings of the next few days, nor is it necessary to touch
at any length upon the history of some of the weeks and months which ensued upon this crisis
in John Lenox's life, a time when it seemed to him that everything he had ever cared for had
been taken. And yet, with that unreason which may perhaps be more easily understood than accounted
for, the one thing upon which his mind most often dwelt was that he had had no answer to his
note to Mary Blake. We know what happened to her missive. It turned up long afterward in the
pocket of Master Jacky Carling's overcoat; so long afterward that John, so far as Mary was
concerned, had disappeared altogether. The discovery of Jacky's dereliction explained to her,
in part at least, why she had never seen him or heard from him after that last evening at Sixty-ninth
Street. This melancholly case took about a quarter before three o' clock in the afternoon-- few minutes
s previously to the time ordinarily set apart for the ringing of the bell for the exercises of Public
Worship.

It was just at the close of a refreshing shower of rain, attended as is usual at this season of the
year, with peals of thunder and flashes of vivid lightening.

The Electric fluid seems to have been attracted by the spire of the Steeple, which-- running up
from the centre of its work of desolation, with a rapidity which was truly
awful and appalling. In a space of time too brief almost to be deemed
credible by such as were not witnesses of the sublime and fearful spectacle,
the entire roof exhibited to the immense multitude gathered around
to mingle their sympathies and tender their assistance, nothing but
one mighty map of living fire-- curling in towards extinction, save
that of Him-- that Dread and Aweful after Being, by whom the flame
had been enkindled.

A period of two hours had distinction, black caps with white fronts with letters thereon
designating their company. ordinary clamour on such occasions," each of
them in action was not elapsed from the commencement of the conflagration,
before the whole edifice except the walls, was involved in one shapeless
mass of smoking ruin, presenting a scene, as desolating and repulsive
to the common citizen, as it was tearful and heart- rending to the
church and congregation.

Our
holy and beautiful house where our fathers praised the Lord-- to use the
language of the Prophet,-- was thus burned up with fire; and all our
pleasant things laid waste. the plank broken from the pews-- all was
destroyed; and but the limits of the corporation; and owing to this
circumstance, connected with its peculiarly clear and inviting tones the
destruction of it-- was caused by its fall from so lofty an eminence--
seemed the occasion of regrets to the public at large, more immediately
expressed than for the edifice itself.

       To the congregation, no loss besides the house, was more deeply deplored than that
of the large and richly toned Organ. Not only because of its superior worth
as an Instrument of Music, the difficulty of replacing it by another,
and the sacred uses to which it was applied, but equally much esteemed
individuals, most four or five months previous, had never been renewed;,--
so that with the exception of twenty- five hundred dollars, the loss
to the congregation was total.

Yet there was one circumstance which ought to be recorded with emotions
of adoring gratitude. The calamity took an place at a time when on ordinary
occasions, some would have been in the house-- as it was so near
the hour Church"-- was the oldest of all the ten places of religious
worship in town.

For many years its bell was the only Church- going signal within of the afternoon' s service,--
and had that been the case now, there is much reason to fear, that
it would have been attended, if not with loss of life, at any rate
with serious injury to not had been completed by Thomas Flemming, and
John Dalton was ordered to procure locks with proper staples for securing
the under the" piazza of the Court House." As the Revolutionary War got under
way many of the members were excused," being frequently abroad on
the Servis of Their Country."

Among these were Captain Valentine Peirs, Captain John Allison, Colonel
John Fitzgerald and. Windsor Brown. Unfortunately the clerks took
for granted that everybody a few. But it had been so ordered by Infinite
Wisdom no doubt, that, for the first? Sabbath in more than two years,
the Church was closed during the whole of that day-- the Pastor having
been providentially called away to supply the pulpit of a sick brother
in the neighboring city of Georgetown.

So that no individual was in the house, and no serious injury occurred
to any individual during the progress of the fire-- and thus, while
there is much to produce of sadness and to call for deep humiliation before
God, he go south for his health. The firm of Lambert& McKenzie offered
Dr. Harrison a free passage to and from the Barbados on the barque
Archibald Gracie.

The minutes of the committee record the motion may be felt, yet it has not
been unattended with significant of kindness and regard.

Dr. Harrison' s lamentations, while justified, were not for complete
demolition. In the minutes of the trustees, the fact is stated that
the roof and cupola burned and fell in, destroying much of the inside
woodwork, but not all. The walls and part of galleries remained intact,
Dr. Muir' s tablet was uninjured, many windows were not broken, and
the organ, at first thought destroyed, was very little injured; it
remains in use to this day, and likewise the old' clock.

However, the damage was and there was only a nominal insurance to cover
the loss. Part of the congregation wished a new building site and
it was given some content, but the" siller"[ silver] was found to
be inadequate for the purpose.

The amount in the treasury did cover the cost of restoration, and on
April 5, 1836, it was" Resolved, That the I congregation of the Church be called
to meet at the Lecture room on Friday evening next at 1/ 2 past 7 o'
clock, to decide permanently on the location of the Church."[ 131]

be grateful he never expected to see another Christmas. He saw at least,
be solemnly Dedicated to the Worship of Almighty God on the last Sabbath

former house of worship was consumed by fire for the real and practical
sympathy of many of our esteemed citizens in braving dangers of no
common magnitude, a like destruction had been the fate of these also.

The house had been for what the rebuilders of 1837 preserved as an outstanding example of Georgian
architecture. In 1843 the tower was added: it goods from burning houses in his bag or basket, climbed

In 1862 the Civil War disrupted the Church. Dr. Elias Harrison died
in 1863 after forty- three years of ministering to his congregation
and with his death the Church ceased to function and its congregation
scattered.

During the Battle of Bull Run, it was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers, and from time to
time it was used by other faiths, including a Negro Baptist congregation.
Neglected, uncared for, the prey of thieves and vandals, the doors were

a a brown linen or oznaburg bag containing at least four yards of material,
and a wicker basket as soon as possible after admittance. These were to
be hung up in good order and always in place. There was a forfeiture of money
for any neglect.

The Company took some several months to acquire proper ladders and
hooks. In April the" propriety of purchasing an Engine" was discussed and at the
June meeting it was because it had been presented by a minute few
venerated and agreed to postpone the matter.

Three ladders were then finished but most of the buckets- law to Colonel William
Fairfax; brother- in- law to Lawrence Washington; commissary of the
Virginia forces under Braddock in 1755; collector of customs were
at the painters being marked with owners' names and numbers.

By August the ladders knew when there had been a fire and rarely are
these important events mentioned in the' minutes.

In January 1777," William Wilson lost a at the late fire" and he was authorized
to purchase another at the Company' s expense; Robert Adam, who was
clerk, forgot to" warn the Company and was fined Ten Shillings"; several
members neglected to put up lights when the early fire happened at
Zael Cooper' s and the fine was two.

The next clerk was" desired to Enquire of the several members if they had candles
at their windows and to collect Fines from such of them as had not."

The light begins to break-- at the first hint of fire the Company member
must, at the is fastest possible speed, put lighted candles in the
front windows of his dwelling.

On February, 1779, a resolution was passed to fine the clerk refusing or
neglecting his duty forty- two shillings, and absent members three
shillings. There was a fine called the" Moreover Fine," which was increased
from five shillings to nine shillings, and the Company voted to dispose

clerk is ordered to give notice that at the next meeting a proposal
will be made to dispose of the money in stock in the purchase of an
engine.

Two months later, undaunted by the recent unpleasantness, the treasurer
was requested to" Import from London on account of this Company a fire engine
value from seventy to eighty pounds sterling." It took two years for the
engine to arrive.

Preparatory to its reception, officers were appointed for
its direction. Nine stalwart members were chosen, and they were ordered
to serve nine months. Six shillings each was insist collected from
the members to help make up the deficiency, and a committee was appointed
to wait upon the county court with a petition requesting ground sufficient
for building an enginehouse upon the courthouse lot. This was granted
and the enginehouse was built on Fairfax Street" adjoining the school
House."

The members were called on for a dollar each for this purpose and
it was later necessary to borrow another dollar. Two keys were ordered
labeled" Fire Company."

 (calculated to induce early rising), a dingy
white spread, a gray blanket of coarse wool, a pair of cotton sheets which had too obviously
done duty since passing through the hands of the laundress, and a pair of flabby little pillows
in the same state, in respect to their cases, as the sheets. On the floor was a much used and
faded ingrain carpet, in one place worn through by the edge of a loose board. A narrow strip
of unpainted pine nailed to the wall carried six or seven wooden pegs to serve as wardrobe.
Two diminutive towels with red borders hung on the rail of the washstand, and a battered tin
slop jar, minus a cover, completed the inventory.

"Heavens, what a hole!" exclaimed John, and as he performed his ablutions (not with the sassafras
soap) he promised himself a speedy flitting. There came a knock at the door, and his host appeared
to announce that his "tea" was ready, and to conduct him to the dining-room--a good-sized apartment,
but narrow, with a long table running near the center lengthwise, covered with a cloth which
bore the marks of many a fray. Another table of like dimensions, but bare, was shoved up against
the wall. Mr. Elright's ravagement of the larder had resulted in a triangle of cadaverous apple
pie, three doughnuts, some chunks of soft white cheese, and a plate of what are known as oyster
crackers.

"I couldn't git ye no tea," he said. "The hired girls both gone out, an' my wife's gone to
bed, an' the' wa'n't no fire anyway."

"I suppose I could have some beer," suggested John, looking dubiously at the banquet.

"We don't keep no ale," said the proprietor of the Eagle, "an' I guess we're out o' lawger.
I ben intendin' to git some more," he added.

"A glass of milk?" proposed the guest, but without confidence.

"Milkman didn't come to-night," said Mr. Elright, shuffling off in his carpet slippers, worn
out in spirit with the importunities of the stranger. There was water on the table, for it
had been left there from supper time. John managed to consume a doughnut and some crackers
and cheese, and then went to his room, carrying the water pitcher with him, and, after a cigarette
or two and a small potation from his flask, to bed. Before retiring, however, he stripped the
bed with the intention of turning the sheets, but upon inspection thought better of it, and
concluded to leave them as they were. So passed his first night in Homeville, and, as he fondly
promised himself, his last at the Eagle Hotel.

When Bill and Dick returned to the office after "obligin' Ame," they stepped with one accord
to the counter and looked at the register. "Why, darn it," exclaimed Bill, "he didn't sign
his name, after all."

"No," said Dick, "but I c'n give a putty near guess who he is, all the same."

"Some drummer?" suggested Bill.

"Naw," said Richard scornfully. "What 'd a drummer be doin' here this time o' year? That's
the feller that's ousted Chet Timson, an' I'll bet ye the drinks on't. Name's Linx or Lenx,
or somethin' like that. Dave told me."

"So that's the feller, is it?" said Bill. "I guess he won't stay 'round here long. I guess
you'll find he's a little too toney fer these parts, an' in pertic'ler fer Dave Harum. Dave'll
make him feel 'bout as comf'table as a rooster in a pond. Lord," he exclaimed, slapping his
leg with a guffaw, "'d you notice Ame's face when he said he didn't want much fer supper, only
beefsteak, an' eggs, an' tea, an' coffee, an' a few little things like that? I thought I'd split."

"Yes," said Dick, laughing, "I guess the' ain't nothin' the matter with Ame's heart, or he'd
'a' fell down dead.--Hullo, Ame!" he said when the gentleman in question came back after ministering
to his guest, "got the Prince o' Wales fixed up all right? Did ye cut that pickled el'phant
that come last week?"

"Huh!" grunted Amos, whose sensibilities had been wounded by the events of the evening, "I
didn't cut no el'phant ner no cow, ner rob no hen roost neither, but I guess he won't starve
'fore mornin'," and with that he proceeded to fill up the stove and shut the dampers.

"That means 'git,' I reckon," remarked Bill as he watched the operation.

"Wa'al," said Mr. Elright, "if you fellers think you've spent enough time droolin' 'round here
swapping lies, I think I'll go to bed," which inhospitable and injurious remark was by no means
taken in bad part, for Dick said, with a laugh:

"Well, Ame, if you'll let me run my face for 'em, Bill 'n I'll take a little somethin' for
the good o' the house before we shed the partin' tear." This proposition was not declined by
Mr. Elright, but he felt bound on business principles not to yield with too great a show of
readiness.

"Wa'al, I don't mind for this once," he said, going behind the bar and setting out a bottle
and glasses, "but I've gen'ally noticed that it's a damn sight easier to git somethin' into
you fellers 'n 't is to git anythin' out of ye."

CHAPTER XIII.

The next morning at nine o'clock John presented himself at Mr. Harum's banking office, which
occupied the first floor of a brick building some twenty or twenty-five feet in width. Besides
the entrance to the bank, there was a door at the south corner opening upon a stairway leading
to a suite of two rooms on the second floor.

The banking office consisted of two rooms--one in front, containing the desks and counters,
and what may be designated as the "parlor" (as used to be the case in the provincial towns)
in the rear, in which were Mr. Harum's private desk, a safe of medium size, the necessary assortment
of chairs, and a lounge. There was also a large Franklin stove.

The parlor was separated from the front room by a partition, in which were two doors, one leading
into the inclosed space behind the desks and counters, and the other into the passageway formed
by the north wall and a length of high desk, topped by a railing. The teller's or cashier's
counter faced the street opposite the entrance door. At the left of this counter (viewed from
the front) was a high-standing desk, with a rail. At the right was a glass-inclosed space of
counter of the same height as that portion which was open, across which latter the business
of paying and receiving was conducted.

As John entered he saw standing behind this open counter, framed, as it were, between the desk
on the one hand, and the glass inclosure on the other, a person whom he conjectured to be the
"Chet" (short for Chester) Timson of whom he had heard. This person nodded in response to our
friend's "Good morning," and anticipated his inquiry by saying:

"You lookin' for Dave?"

"I am looking for Mr. Harum," said John. "Is he in the office?"

"He hain't come in yet," was the reply. "Up to the barn, I reckon, but he's liable to come
in any minute, an' you c'n step into the back room an' wait fer him," indicating the direction
with a wave of his hand.

Business had not begun to be engrossing, though the bank was open, and John had hardly seated
himself when Timson came into the back room and, taking a chair where he could see the counter
in the front office, proceeded to investigate the stranger, of whose identity he had not the
smallest doubt. But it was not Mr. Timson's way to take things for granted in silence, and
it must be admitted that his curiosity in this particular case was not without warrant. After
a scrutiny of John's face and person, which was not brief enough to be unnoticeable, he said,
with a directness which left nothing in that line to be desired, "I reckon you're the new man
Dave's ben gettin' up from the city."

"I came up yesterday," admitted John.

"My name's Timson," said Chet.

"Happy to meet you," said John, rising and putting out his hand. "My name is Lenox," and they
shook hands--that is, John grasped the ends of four limp fingers. After they had subsided into
their seats, Chet's opaquely bluish eyes made another tour of inspection, in curiosity and wonder.

"You alwus lived in the city?" he said at last.

"It has always been my home," was the reply.

"What put it in your head to come up here?" with another stare.

"It was at Mr. Harum's suggestion," replied John, not with perfect candor; but he was not minded
to be drawn out too far.

"D'ye know Dave?"

"I have never met him." Mr. Timson looked more puzzled than ever.

"Ever ben in the bankin' bus'nis?"

"I have had some experience of such accounts in a general way."

"Ever keep books?"

"Only as I have told you," said John, smiling at the little man.

"Got any idee what you'll have to do up here?" asked Chet.

"Only in a general way."

"Wa'al," said Mr. Timson, "I c'n tell ye; an', what's more, I c'n tell ye, young man, 't you
hain't no idee of what you're undertakin', an' ef you don't wish you was back in New York 'fore
you git through I ain't no guesser."

"That is possible," said John readily, recalling his night and his breakfast that morning.

"Yes, sir," said the other. "Yes, sir; if you do what I've had to do, you'll do the hull darned
thing, an' nobody to help you but Pele Hopkins, who don't count fer a row o' crooked pins.
As fer's Dave's concerned," asserted the speaker with a wave of his hands, "he don't know no
more about bankin' 'n a cat. He couldn't count a thousan' dollars in an hour, an', as for addin'
up a row o' figures, he couldn't git it twice alike, I don't believe, if he was to be hung for't."

"He must understand the meaning of his own books and accounts, I should think," remarked John.

"Oh," said Chet scornfully, "anybody c'd do that. That's easy 'nough; but as fur 's the real
bus'nis is concerned, he don't have nothin' to do with it. It's all ben left to me: chargin'
an' creditin', postin', individule ledger, gen'ral ledger, bill-book, discount register, tickler,
for'n register, checkin' off the N'York accounts, drawin' off statemunts f'm the ledgers an'
bill-book, writin' letters--why, the' ain't an hour 'n the day in bus'nis hours some days that
the's an hour 't I ain't busy 'bout somethin'. No, sir," continued Chet, "Dave don't give himself
no trouble about the bus'nis. All he does is to look after lendin' the money, an' seein' that
it gits paid when the time comes, an' keep track of how much money the' is here an' in N'York,
an' what notes is comin' due--an' a few things like that, that don't put pen to paper, ner
take an hour of his time. Why, a man'll come in an' want to git a note done, an' it'll be 'All
right,' or, 'Can't spare the money to-day,' all in a minute. He don't give it no thought at
all, an' he ain't 'round here half the time. Now," said Chet, "when I work fer a man I like
to have him 'round so 't I c'n say to him: 'Shall I do it so? or shall I do it so? shall I?
or sha'n't I?' an' then when I make a mistake--'s anybody's liable to--he's as much to blame
's I be."

"I suppose, then," said John, "that you must have to keep Mr. Harum's private accounts also,
seeing that he knows so little of details. I have been told that he is interested in a good
many matters besides this business."

"Wa'al," replied Timson, somewhat disconcerted, "I suppose he must keep 'em himself in some
kind of a fashion, an' I don't know a thing about any outside matters of his'n, though I suspicion
he has got quite a few. He's got some books in that safe" (pointing with his finger) "an' he's
got a safe in the vault, but if you'll believe me"--and the speaker looked as if he hardly
expected it--"I hain't never so much as seen the inside of either one on 'em. No, sir," he
declared, "I hain't no more idee of what's in them safes 'n you have. He's close, Dave Harum
is," said Chet with a convincing motion of the head; "on the hull, the clostest man I ever
see. I believe," he averred, "that if he was to lay out to keep it shut that lightnin' might
strike him square in the mouth an' it wouldn't go in an eighth of an inch. An' yet," he added,
"he c'n talk by the rod when he takes a notion."

"Must be a difficult person to get on with," commented John dryly.

"I couldn't stan' it no longer," declared Mr. Timson with the air of one who had endured to
the end of virtue, "an' I says to him the other day, 'Wa'al,' I says, 'if I can't suit ye,
mebbe you'd better suit yourself.'"

"Ah!" said John politely, seeing that some response was expected of him; "and what did he say
to that?"

"He ast me," replied Chet, "if I meant by that to throw up the situation. 'Wa'al,' I says 'I'm
sick enough to throw up most anythin',' I says, 'along with bein' found fault with fer nothin'.'"

"And then?" queried John, who had received the impression that the motion to adjourn had come
from the other side of the house.

"Wa'al," replied Chet, not quite so confidently, "he said somethin' about my requirin' a larger
spear of action, an' that he thought I'd do better on a mile track--some o' his hoss talk.
That's another thing," said Timson, changing the subject. "He's all fer hosses. He'd sooner
make a ten-dollar note on a hoss trade than a hunderd right here 'n this office. Many's the
time right in bus'nis hours, when I've wanted to ask him how he wanted somethin' done, he'd
be busy talkin' hoss, an' wouldn't pay no attention to me more'n 's if I wa'n't there."

"I am glad to feel," said John, "that you can not possibly have any unpleasant feeling toward
me, seeing that you resigned as you did."

"Cert'nly not, cert'nly not," declared Timson, a little uneasily. "If it hadn't 'a' ben you,
it would 'a' had to ben somebody else, an' now I seen you an' had a talk with you--Wa'al, I
guess I better git back into the other room. Dave's liable to come in any minute. But," he
said in parting, "I will give ye piece of advice: You keep enough laid by to pay your gettin'
back to N'York. You may want it in a hurry," and with this parting shot the rejected one took
his leave.

       *       *       *       *       *

The bank parlor was lighted by a window and a glazed door in the rear wall, and another window
on the south side. Mr. Harum's desk was by the rear, or west, window, which gave view of his
house, standing some hundred feet back from the street. The south, or side, window afforded
a view of his front yard and that of an adjoining dwelling, beyond which rose the wall of a
mercantile block. Business was encroaching upon David's domain. Our friend stood looking out
of the south window. To the left a bit of Main Street was visible, and the naked branches of
the elms and maples with which it was bordered were waving defiantly at their rivals over the
way, incited thereto by a northwest wind.

We invariably form a mental picture of every unknown person of whom we think at all. It may
be so faint that we are unconscious of it at the time, or so vivid that it is always recalled
until dissipated by seeing the person himself, or his likeness. But that we do so make a picture
is proved by the fact that upon being confronted by the real features of the person in question
we always experience a certain amount of surprise, even when we have not been conscious of
a different conception of him.

Be that as it may, however, there was no question in John Lenox's mind as to the identity of
the person who at last came briskly into the back office and interrupted his meditations. Rather
under the middle height, he was broad-shouldered and deep-chested, with a clean-shaven, red
face, with--not a mole--but a slight protuberance the size of half a large pea on the line
from the nostril to the corner of the mouth; bald over the crown and to a line a couple of
inches above the ear, below that thick and somewhat bushy hair of yellowish red, showing a
mingling of gray; small but very blue eyes; a thick nose, of no classifiable shape, and a large
mouth with the lips so pressed together as to produce a slightly downward and yet rather humorous
curve at the corners. He was dressed in a sack coat of dark "pepper-and-salt," with waistcoat
and trousers to match. A somewhat old-fashioned standing collar, flaring away from the throat,
was encircled by a red cravat, tied in a bow under his chin. A diamond stud of perhaps two
carats showed in the triangle of spotless shirt front, and on his head was a cloth cap with
ear lappets. He accosted our friend with, "I reckon you must be Mr. Lenox. How are you? I'm
glad to see you," tugging off a thick buckskin glove, and putting out a plump but muscular hand.

John thanked him as they shook hands, and "hoped he was well."

"Wa'al," said Mr. Harum, "I'm improvin' slowly. I've got so 'st I c'n set up long enough to
have my bed made. Come last night, I s'pose? Anybody to the deepo to bring ye over? This time
o' year once 'n a while the' don't nobody go over for passengers."

John said that he had had no trouble. A man by the name of Robinson had brought him and his
luggage.

"E-up!" said David with a nod, backing up to the fire which was burning in the grate of the
Franklin stove, "'Dug' Robinson. 'D he do the p'lite thing in the matter of questions an' gen'ral
conversation?" he asked with a grin. John laughed in reply to this question.

"Where'd you put up?" asked David, John said that he passed the night at the Eagle Hotel. Mr.
Harum had seen Dick Larrabee that morning and heard what he had to say of our friend's reception,
but he liked to get his information from original sources.

"Make ye putty comf'table?" he asked, turning to eject a mouthful into the fire.

"I got along pretty well under the circumstances," said John.

Mr. Harum did not press the inquiry. "How'd you leave the gen'ral?" he inquired.

"He seemed to be well," replied John, "and he wished to be kindly remembered to you."

"Fine man, the gen'ral," declared David, well pleased. "Fine man all 'round. Word's as good
as his bond. Yes, sir, when the gen'ral gives his warrant, I don't care whether I see the critter
or not. Know him much?"

"He and my father were old friends, and I have known him a good many years," replied John,
adding, "he has been very kind and friendly to me."

"Set down, set down," said Mr. Harum, pointing to a chair. Seating himself, he took off his
cap and dropped it with his gloves on the floor. "How long you ben here in the office?" he asked.

"Perhaps half an hour," was the reply.

"I meant to have ben here when you come," said the banker, "but I got hendered about a matter
of a hoss I'm looking at. I guess I'll shut that door," making a move toward the one into the
front office.

"Allow me," said John, getting up and closing it.

"May's well shut the other one while you're about it. Thank you," as John resumed his seat.
"I hain't got nothin' very private, but I'm 'fraid of distractin' Timson's mind. Did he int'duce
himself?"

"Yes," said John, "we introduced ourselves and had a few minutes conversation."

"Gin ye his hull hist'ry an' a few relations throwed in?"

"There was hardly time for that," said John, smiling.

"Rubbed a little furn'ture polish into my char'cter an' repitation?" insinuated Mr. Harum.

"Most of our talk was on the subject of his duties and responsibilities," was John's reply.
("Don't cal'late to let on any more'n he cal'lates to," thought David to himself.)

"Allowed he run the hull shebang, didn't he?"

"He seemed to have a pretty large idea of what was required of one in his place," admitted
the witness.

"Kind o' friendly, was he?" asked David.

"Well," said John, "after we had talked for a while I said to him that I was glad to think
that he could have no unpleasant feeling toward me, seeing that he had given up the place of
his own preference, and he assured me that he had none."

David turned and looked at John for an instant, with a twinkle in his eye. The younger man
returned the look and smiled slightly. David laughed outright.

"I guess you've seen folks before," he remarked.

"I have never met any one exactly like Mr. Timson, I think," said our friend with a slight laugh.

"Fortunitly them kind is rare," observed Mr. Harum dryly, rising and going to his desk, from
a drawer of which he produced a couple of cigars, one of which he proffered to John, who, for
the first time in his life, during the next half hour regretted that he was a smoker. David
sat for two or three minutes puffing diligently, and then took the weed out of his mouth and
looked contemplatively at it.

"How do you like that cigar?" he inquired.

"It burns very nicely," said the victim. Mr. Harum emitted a cough which was like a chuckle,
or a chuckle which was like a cough, and relapsed into silence again. Presently he turned his
head, looked curiously at the young man for a moment, and then turned his glance again to the fire.

"I've ben wonderin' some," he said, "pertic'lerly since I see you, how 't was 't you wanted
to come up here to Homeville. Gen'l Wolsey gin his warrant, an' so I reckon you hadn't ben
gettin' into no scrape nor nothin'," and again he looked sharply at the young man at his side.

"Did the general say nothing of my affairs?" the latter asked.

"No," replied David, "all 't he said was in a gen'ral way that he'd knowed you an' your folks
a good while, an' he thought you'd be jest the feller I was lookin' fer. Mebbe he reckoned
that if you wanted your story told, you'd ruther tell it yourself."

CHAPTER XIV.

Whatever might have been John's repugnance to making a confidant of the man whom he had known
but for half an hour, he acknowledged to himself that the other's curiosity was not only natural
but proper. He could not but know that in appearance and manner he was in marked contrast with
those whom the man had so far seen. He divined the fact that his coming from a great city to
settle down in a village town would furnish matter for surprise and conjecture, and felt that
it would be to his advantage with the man who was to be his employer that he should be perfectly
and obviously frank upon all matters of his own which might be properly mentioned. He had an
instinctive feeling that Harum combined acuteness and suspiciousness to a very large degree,
and he had also a feeling that the old man's confidence, once gained, would not be easily shaken.
So he told his hearer so much of his history as he thought pertinent, and David listened without
interruption or comment, save an occasional "E-um'm."

"And here I am," John remarked in conclusion.

"Here you be, fer a fact," said David. "Wa'al, the's worse places 'n Homeville--after you git
used to it," he added in qualification. "I ben back here a matter o' thirteen or fourteen year
now, an' am gettin' to feel my way 'round putty well; but not havin' ben in these parts fer
putty nigh thirty year, I found it ruther lonesome to start with, an' I guess if it hadn't
'a' ben fer Polly I wouldn't 'a' stood it. But up to the time I come back she hadn't never
ben ten mile away f'm here in her hull life, an' I couldn't budge her. But then," he remarked,
"while Homeville aint a metrop'lis, it's some a diff'rent place f'm what it used to be--in
some ways. Polly's my sister," he added by way of explanation.

"Well," said John, with rather a rueful laugh, "if it has taken you all that time to get used
to it the outlook for me is not very encouraging, I'm afraid."

"Wa'al," remarked Mr. Harum, "I'm apt to speak in par'bles sometimes. I guess you'll git along
after a spell, though it mayn't set fust rate on your stomech till you git used to the diet.
Say," he said after a moment, "if you'd had a couple o' thousan' more, do you think you'd 'a'
stuck to the law bus'nis?"

"I'm sure I don't know," replied John, "but I am inclined to think not. General Wolsey told
me that if I were very anxious to go on with it he would help me, but after what I told him
he advised me to write to you."

"He did, did he?"

"Yes," said John, "and after what I had gone through I was not altogether sorry to come away."

"Wa'al," said Mr. Harum thoughtfully, "if I was to lose what little I've got, an' had to give
up livin' in the way I was used to, an' couldn't even keep a hoss, I c'n allow 't I might be
willin' fer a change of scene to make a fresh start in. Yes, sir, I guess I would. Wa'al,"
looking at his watch, "I've got to go now, an' I'll see ye later, mebbe. Are my fellow- pest incorrectly
in withholding a support from me, while I am rather refer my own preference
and attitude than their necessities?' It may then happen to him that
the great jurisprudence must someway be obeyed-- a something must be
done for mankind which they require, and it must be done where and how
they require it, in order that each single may have a truthful claim
upon the part.

To acquire into the correct and fitting grave in the social device
may be hard; but there is no alternative.

David stood for a moment drawing on his gloves, and then, looking at John with his characteristic
chuckle, continued:

"Allowed he'd ben drawin' the hull load, did he? Wa'al, sir, the truth on't is 't he never
come to a hill yet, 'f 't wa'n't more 'n a foot high, but what I had to git out an' push; nor
never struck a turn in the road but what I had to take him by the head an' lead him into it."
With which Mr. Harum put on his overcoat and cap and departed.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Timson was leaning over the counter in animated controversy with a man on the outside who
had evidently asserted or quoted (the quotation is the usual weapon: it has a double barb and
can be wielded with comparative safety) something of a wounding effect.

"No, sir," exclaimed Chet, with a sounding slap on the counter, "no, sir! The' ain't one word
o' truth in't. I said myself, 'I won't stan' it,' I says, 'not f'm you ner nobody else,' I
says, 'an' what's more,' says I--" The expression in the face of Mr. Timson's tormentor caused
that gentleman to break off and look around. The man on the outside grinned, stared at John
a moment, and went out, and Timson turned and said, as John came forward, "Hello! The old man
picked ye to pieces all he wanted to?"

"We are through for the day, I fancy," said our friend, smiling, "and if you are ready to begin
my lessons I am ready to take them. Mr. Harum told me that you would be good enough to show
me what was necessary."

"All right," said Mr. Timson readily enough, and so John began his first day's work in David's
office. He was surprised and encouraged to find how much his experience in Rush & Company's
office stood him in hand, and managed to acquire in a comparatively short time a pretty fair
comprehension of the system which prevailed in "Harum's bank," notwithstanding the incessant
divagations of his instructor.

It was decided between Timson and our friend that on the following day the latter should undertake
the office work under supervision, and the next morning John was engaged upon the preliminaries
of the day's business when his employer came in and seated himself at his desk in the back
room. After a few minutes, in which he was busy with his letters, he appeared in the doorway
of the front room. He did not speak, for John saw him, and, responding to a backward toss of
the head, followed him into the "parlor," and at an intimation of the same silent character
shut the doors. Mr. Harum sat down at his desk, and John stood awaiting his pleasure.

"How 'd ye make out yestidy?" he asked. "Git anythin' out of old tongue-tied?" pointing with
his thumb toward the front room.

"Oh, yes," said John, smiling, as he recalled the unceasing flow of words which had enveloped
Timson's explanations.

"How much longer do you think you'll have to have him 'round?" asked Mr. Harum.

"Well," said John, "of course your customers are strangers to me, but so far as the routine
of the office is concerned I think I can manage after to-day. But I shall have to appeal to
you rather often for a while until I get thoroughly acquainted with my work."

"Good fer you," said David. "You've took holt a good sight quicker 'n I thought ye would, an'
I'll spend more or less time 'round here fer a while, or be where you c'n reach me. It's like
this," he continued; "Chet's a helpless kind of critter, fer all his braggin' an' talk, an'
I ben feelin' kind o' wambly about turnin' him loose--though the Lord knows," he said with
feeling, "'t I've had bother enough with him to kill a tree. But anyway I wrote to some folks
I know up to Syrchester to git something fer him to do, an' I got a letter to send him along,
an' mebbe they'd give him a show. See?"

"Yes, sir," said John, "and if you are willing to take the chances of my mistakes I will undertake
to get on without him."

"All right," said the banker, "we'll call it a heat--and, say, don't let on what I've told
you. I want to see how long it'll take to git all over the village that he didn't ask no odds
o' nobody. Hadn't ben out o' a job three days 'fore the' was a lot o' chances, an' all 't he
had to do was to take his pick out o' the lot on 'em."

"Really?" said John.

"Yes, sir," said David. "Some folks is gaited that way. Amusin', ain't it?--Hullo, Dick! Wa'al?"

"Willis'll give two hunderd fer the sorr'l colt," said the incomer, whom John recognized as
one of the loungers in the Eagle bar the night of his arrival.

"E-um'm!" said David. "Was he speakin' of any pertic'ler colt, or sorril colts in gen'ral?
I hain't got the only one the' is, I s'pose."

Dick merely laughed. "Because," continued the owner of the "sorril colt," "if Steve Willis
wants to lay in sorril colts at two hunderd a piece, I ain't goin' to gainsay him, but you
tell him that two-forty-nine ninety-nine won't buy the one in my barn." Dick laughed again.

John made a move in the direction of the front room.

"Hold on a minute," said David. "Shake hands with Mr. Larrabee."

"Seen ye before," said Dick, as they shook hands. "I was in the barroom when you come in the
other night," and then he laughed as at the recollection of something very amusing.

John flushed a little and said, a bit stiffly, "I remember you were kind enough to help about
my luggage."

"Excuse me," said Dick, conscious of the other's manner. "I wa'n't laughin' at you, that is,
not in pertic'ler. I couldn't see your face when Ame offered ye pie an' doughnuts instid of
beefsteak an' fixins. I c'd only guess at that; but Ame's face was enough fer me," and Dick
went off into another cachinnation.

David's face indicated some annoyance. "Oh, shet up," he exclaimed. "You'd keep that yawp o'
your'n goin', I believe, if it was the judgment day."

"Wa'al," said Dick with a grin, "I expect the' might be some fun to be got out o' that, if
a feller wa'n't worryin' too much about his own skin; an' as fur's I'm concerned----" Dick's
further views on the subject of that momentous occasion were left unexplained. A significant
look in David's face caused the speaker to break off and turn toward the door, through which
came two men, the foremost a hulking, shambling fellow, with an expression of repellent sullenness.
He came forward to within about ten feet of David's desk, while his companion halted near the
door. David eyed him in silence.

"I got this here notice this mornin'," said the man, "sayin' 't my note 'd be due to-morrer,
an' 'd have to be paid."

"Wa'al," said David, with his arm over the back of his chair and his left hand resting on his
desk, "that's so, ain't it?"

"Mebbe so," was the fellow's reply, "fur 's the comin' due 's concerned, but the payin' part
's another matter."

"Was you cal'latin' to have it renewed?" asked David, leaning a little forward.

"No," said the man coolly, "I don't know 's I want to renew it fer any pertic'ler time, an'
I guess it c'n run along fer a while jest as 't is." John looked at Dick Larrabee. He was watching
David's face with an expression of the utmost enjoyment. David twisted his chair a little more
to the right and out from the desk.

"You think it c'n run along, do ye?" he asked suavely. "I'm glad to have your views on the
subject. Wa'al, I guess it kin, too, until to-morro' at four o'clock, an' after that you c'n
settle with lawyer Johnson or the sheriff." The man uttered a disdainful laugh.

"I guess it'll puzzle ye some to c'lect it," he said. Mr. Harum's bushy red eyebrows met above
his nose.

"Look here, Bill Montaig," he said, "I know more 'bout this matter 'n you think for. I know
't you ben makin' your brags that you'd fix me in this deal. You allowed that you'd set up
usury in the fust place, an' if that didn't work I'd find you was execution proof anyways.
That's so, ain't it?"

"That's about the size on't," said Montaig, putting his feet a little farther apart. David
had risen from his chair.

"You didn't talk that way," proceeded the latter, "when you come whinin' 'round here to git
that money in the fust place, an' as I reckon some o' the facts in the case has slipped out
o' your mind since that time, I guess I'd better jog your mem'ry a little."

It was plain from the expression of Mr. Montaig's countenance that his confidence in the strength
of his position was not quite so assured as at first, but he maintained his attitude as well
as in him lay.

"In the fust place," David began his assault, "I didn't lend ye the money. I borr'ed it for
ye on my indorsement, an' charged ye fer doin' it, as I told ye at the time; an' another thing
that you appear to forgit is that you signed a paper statin' that you was wuth, in good and
available pusson'ls, free an' clear, over five hunderd dollars, an' that the statement was
made to me with the view of havin' me indorse your note fer one-fifty. Rec'lect that?" David
smiled grimly at the look of disconcert which, in spite of himself, appeared in Bill's face.

"I don't remember signin' no paper," he said doggedly.

"Jest as like as not," remarked Mr. Harum. "What you was thinkin' of about that time was gittin'
that money."

"I'd like to see that paper," said Bill, with a pretence of incredulity.

"You'll see it when the time comes," asserted David, with an emphatic nod. He squared himself,
planting his feet apart, and, thrusting his hands deep in his coat pockets, faced the discomfited
yokel.

"Do you think, Bill Montaig," he said, with measureless contempt, "that I didn't know who I
was dealin' with? that I didn't know what a low-lived, roost-robbin' skunk you was? an' didn't
know how to protect myself agin such an'muls as you be? Wa'al, I did, an' don't you stop thinkin'
'bout it--an'," he added, shaking his finger at the object of his scorn, "you'll pay that note
or I'll put ye where the dogs won't bite ye," and with that he turned on his heel and resumed
his seat. Bill stood for a minute with a scowl of rage and defeat in his lowering face.

"Got any further bus'nis with me?" inquired Mr. Harum. "Anythin' more 't I c'n oblige ye about?"
There was no answer.

"I asked you," said David, raising his voice and rising to his feet, "if you had any further
bus'nis with me."

"I dunno's I have," was the sullen response.

"All right," said David. "That bein' the case, an' as I've got somethin' to do beside wastin'
my time on such wuthless pups as you be, I'll thank you to git out. There's the door," he added,
pointing to it.

"He, he, he, he, ho, ho, ha, h-o-o-o-o-o!" came from the throat of Dick Larrabee. This was
too much for the exasperated Bill, and he erred (to put it mildly) in raising his arm and advancing
a step toward his creditor. He was not swift enough to take the second, however, for David,
with amazing quickness, sprang upon him, and twisting him around, rushed him out of the door,
down the passage, and out of the front door, which was obligingly held open by an outgoing
client, who took in the situation and gave precedence to Mr. Montaig. His companion, who so
far had taken no part, made a motion to interfere, but John, who stood nearest to him, caught
him by the collar and jerked him back, with the suggestion that it would be better to let the
two have it out by themselves. David came back rather breathless and very red in the face,
but evidently in exceeding good humor.

"Scat my ----!" he exclaimed. "Hain't had such a good tussle I dunno when."

"Bill's considered ruther an awk'ard customer," remarked Dick. "I guess he hain't had no such
handlin' fer quite a while."

"Sho!" exclaimed Mr. Harum. "The' ain't nothin' to him but wind an' meanness. Who was that
feller with him?"

"Name 's Smith, I believe," replied Dick. "Guess Bill brought him along fer a witness, an'
I reckon he seen all he wanted to. I'll bet his neck's achin' some," added Mr. Larrabee with
a laugh.

"How's that?" asked David.

"Well, he made a move to tackle you as you was escortin' Bill out, an' Mr. Lenox there caught
him in the collar an' gin him a jerk that'd 'a' landed him on his back," said Dick, "if," turning
to John, "you hadn't helt holt of him. You putty nigh broke his neck. He went off--he, he,
he, he, ho!--wrigglin' it to make sure."

"I used more force than was necessary, I'm afraid," said Billy Williams's pupil, "but there
wasn't much time to calculate."

"Much obliged," said David with a nod.

"Not at all," protested John, laughing. "I have enjoyed a great deal this morning."

"It has ben ruther pleasant," remarked David with a chuckle, "but you mustn't cal'late on havin'
such fun ev'ry mornin'."

John went into the business office, leaving the banker and Dick.

"Say," said the latter when they were alone, "that young man o' your'n 's quite a feller. He
took care o' that big Smith chap with one hand; an' say, you c'n git round on your pins 'bout
's lively 's they make 'em, I guess. I swan!" he exclaimed, slapping his thigh and shaking
with laughter, "the hull thing head-an'-shouldered any show I seen lately." And then for a
while they fell to talking of the "sorril colt" and other things.

CHAPTER XV.

When John went back to the office after the noonday intermission it was manifest that something
had happened to Mr. Timson, and that the something was of a nature extremely gratifying to
that worthy gentleman. He was beaming with satisfaction and rustling with importance. Several
times during the afternoon he appeared to be on the point of confiding his news, but in the
face of the interruptions which occurred, or which he feared might check the flow of his communication,
he managed to restrain himself till after the closing of the office. But scarcely were the
shutters up (at the willing hands of Peleg Hopkins) when he turned to John and, looking at
him sharply, said, "Has Dave said anythin' 'bout my leavin'?"

"He told me he expected you would stay as long as might be necessary to get me well started,"
said John non-committally, mindful of Mr. Harum's injunction.

"Jest like him," declared Chet. "Jest like him for all the world; but the fact o' the matter
is 't I'm goin' to-morro'. I s'pose he thought," reflected Mr. Timson, "thet he'd ruther you'd
find it out yourself than to have to break it to ye, 'cause then, don't ye see, after I was
gone he c'd lay the hull thing at my door."

"Really," said John, "I should have said that he ought to have told me."

"Wa'al," said Chet encouragingly, "mebbe you'll git along somehow, though I'm 'fraid you'll
have more or less trouble; but I told Dave that as fur 's I c'd see, mebbe you'd do 's well
's most anybody he c'd git that didn't know any o' the customers, an' hadn't never done any
o' this kind o' work before."

"Thank you very much," said John. "And so you are off to-morrow, are you?"

"Got to be," declared Mr. Timson. "I'd 'a' liked to stay with you a spell longer, but the's
a big concern f'm out of town that as soon as they heard I was at libe'ty wrote for me to come
right along up, an' I s'pose I hadn't ought to keep 'em waitin'."

"No, I should think not," said John, "and I congratulate you upon having located yourself so
quickly."

"Oh!" said Mr. Timson, with ineffable complacency, "I hain't give myself no worry; I hain't
lost no sleep. I've allowed all along that Dave Harum'd find out that he wa'n't the unly man
that needed my kind o' work, an' I ain't meanin' any disrispect to you when I say 't--"

"Just so," said John. "I quite understand. Nobody could expect to take just the place with
him that you have filled. And, by the way," he added, "as you are going in the morning, and
I may not see you again, would you kindly give me the last balance sheets of the two ledgers
and the bill-book. I suppose, of course, that they are brought down to the first of the month,
and I shall want to have them."

"Oh, yes, cert'nly, of course--wa'al I guess Dave's got 'em," replied Chet, looking considerably
disconcerted, "but I'll look 'em up in the mornin'. My train don't go till ten o'clock, an'
I'll see you 'bout any little last thing in the mornin'--but I guess I've got to go now on
account of a lot of things. You c'n shut up, can't ye?"

Whereupon Mr. Timson made his exit, and not long afterward David came in. By that time everything
had been put away, the safe and vault closed, and Peleg had departed with the mail and his
freedom for the rest of the day.

"Wa'al," said Mr. Harum, lifting himself to a seat on the counter, "how've you made out? All O.K.?"

"Yes," replied John, "I think so."

"Where's Chet?"

"He went away some few minutes ago. He said he had a good many things to attend to as he was
leaving in the morning."

"E-um'm!" said David incredulously. "I guess 't won't take him long to close up his matters.
Did he leave ev'rything in good shape? Cash all right, an' so on?"

"I think so," said John. "The cash is right I am sure."

"How 'bout the books?"

"I asked him to let me have the balance sheets, and he said that you must have them, but that
he would come in in the morning and--well, what he said was that he would see me in the morning,
and, as he put it, look after any little last thing."

"E-um'm!" David grunted. "He won't do no such a thing. We've seen the last of him, you bet,
an' a good riddance. He'll take the nine o'clock to-night, that's what he'll do. Drawed his
pay, I guess, didn't he?"

"He said he was to be paid for this month," answered John, "and took sixty dollars. Was that
right?"

"Yes," said David, nodding his head absently. "What was it he said about them statements?"
he inquired after a moment.

"He said he guessed you must have them."

"E-um'm!" was David's comment. "What'd he say about leavin'?"

John laughed and related the conversation as exactly as he could.

"What'd I tell ye," said Mr. Harum, with a short laugh. "Mebbe he won't go till to-morro',
after all," he remarked. "He'll want to put in a leetle more time tellin' how he was sent for
in a hurry by that big concern f'm out of town 't he's goin' to."

"Upon my word, I can't understand it," said John, "knowing that you can contradict him."

"Wa'al," said David, "he'll allow that if he gits in the fust word, he'll take the pole. It
don't matter anyway, long 's he's gone. I guess you an' me c'n pull the load, can't we?" and
he dropped down off the counter and started to go out. "By the way," he said, halting a moment,
"can't you come in to tea at six o'clock? I want to make ye acquainted with Polly, an' she's
itchin' to see ye."

"I shall be delighted," said John.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Polly," said David, "I've ast the young feller to come to tea, but don't you say the word
'Eagle,' to him. You c'n show your ign'rance 'bout all the other kinds of birds an' animals
you ain't familiar with," said the unfeeling brother, "but leave eagles alone."

"What you up to now?" she asked, but she got no answer but a laugh.

From a social point of view the entertainment could not be described as a very brilliant success.
Our friend was tired and hungry. Mr. Harum was unusually taciturn, and Mrs. Bixbee, being under
her brother's interdict as regarded the subject which, had it been allowed discussion, might
have opened the way, was at a loss for generalities. But John afterward got upon terms of the
friendliest nature with that kindly soul.

CHAPTER XVI.

Some weeks after John's assumption of his duties in the office of David Harum, Banker, that
gentleman sat reading his New York paper in the "wing settin'-room," after tea, and Aunt Polly
was occupied with the hemming of a towel. The able editorial which David was perusing was strengthening
his conviction that all the intelligence and virtue of the country were monopolized by the
Republican party, when his meditations were broken in upon by Mrs. Bixbee, who knew nothing
and cared less about the Force Bill or the doctrine of protection to American industries.

"You hain't said nothin' fer quite a while about the bank," she remarked. "Is Mr. Lenox gittin'
along all right?"

"Guess he's gittin' into condition as fast as c'd be expected," said David, between two lines
of his editorial.

"It must be awful lonesome fer him," she observed, to which there was no reply.

"Ain't it?" she asked, after an interval.

"Ain't what?" said David, looking up at her.

"Awful lonesome," she reiterated.

"Guess nobody ain't ever very lonesome when you're 'round an' got your breath," was the reply.
"What you talkin' about?"

"I ain't talkin' about you, 't any rate," said Mrs. Bixbee. "I was sayin' it must be awful
lonesome fer Mr. Lenox up here where he don't know a soul hardly, an' livin' at that hole of
a tavern."

"I don't see 't you've any cause to complain long's he don't," said David, hoping that it would
not come to his sister's ears that he had, for reasons of his own, discouraged any attempt
on John's part to better his quarters, "an' he hain't ben very lonesome daytimes, I guess,
so fur, 'thout he's ben makin' work fer himself to kill time."

"What do you mean?"

"Wa'al," said David, "we found that Chet hadn't done more 'n to give matters a lick an' a promise
in most a year. He done just enough to keep up the day's work an' no more an' the upshot on't
is that John's had to put in consid'able time to git things straightened out."

"What a shame!" exclaimed Aunt Polly.

"Keeps him f'm bein' lonesome," remarked her brother with a grin.

"An' he hain't had no time to himself!" she protested. "I don't believe you've made up your
mind yet whether you're goin' to like him, an' I don't believe he'll stay anyway."

"I've told more 'n forty-leven times," said Mr. Harum, looking up over his paper, "that I thought
we was goin' to make a hitch of it, an' he cert'nly hain't said nuthin' 'bout leavin', an'
I guess he won't fer a while, tavern or no tavern. He's got a putty stiff upper lip of his
own, I reckon," David further remarked, with a short laugh, causing Mrs. Bixbee to look up
at him inquiringly, which look the speaker answered with a nod, saying, "Me an' him had a little
go-round to-day."

"You hain't had no words, hev ye?" she asked anxiously.

"Wa'al, we didn't have what ye might call words. I was jest tryin' a little experiment with him."

"Humph," she remarked, "you're alwus tryin' exper'ments on somebody, an' you'll be liable to
git ketched at it some day."

"Exceptin' on you," said David. "You don't think I'd try any experiments on you, do ye?"

"Me!" she cried. "You're at me the hull endurin' time, an' you know it."

"Wa'al, but Polly," said David insinuatingly, "you don't know how int'restin' you be."

"Glad you think so," she declared, with a sniff and a toss of the head. "What you ben up to
with Mr. Lenox?"

"Oh, nuthin' much," replied Mr. Harum, making a feint of resuming his reading.

"Be ye goin' to tell me, or--air ye too 'shamed on't?" she added with a little laugh, which
somewhat turned the tables on her teasing brother.

"Wa'al, I laid out to try an' read this paper," he said, spreading it out on his lap, "but,"
resignedly, "I guess 't ain't no use. Do you know what a count'fit bill is?" he asked.

"I dunno 's I ever see one," she said, "but I s'pose I do. They're agin the law, ain't they?"

"The's a number o' things that's agin the law," remarked David dryly.

"Wa'al?" ejaculated Mrs. Bixbee after a moment of waiting. 

The moral is, setting up hospitals, and achieving for her sex something like equal rights before the law
the sheep may be." But time and advancing civilization have tended
steadily in one direction."

He giveth
power to the weak, and to them who have no might He increaseth. Either she has herself, as a seeker
after, to be a most foolish or ill- judging person,-- or else, was said
of Washington' s being a villain," the epithet is not felicitous."
THE ROB ROY THEORY"

The Saturday would tend still older farther to promote order than has been done by the that the love of notoriety
is soon is in the world; she cannot be got rid of: she must be a
serf or an equal; there is no middle ground amply filled, in a reformer'
s experience, and that he will not, as a rule, sacrifice home and
comfort, money and friends, without some stronger inducement.

This is certainly true of most of the men who have interested themselves in
this particular movement, the" weak- minded men," as the reporters, with be witty
antithesis, still describe them; and it must be much the same with the" strong-
minded women" who share their base career. And it is to be remembered,
above all, that, considered as an engine for obtaining notoriety, the
woman- suffrage agitation is a great waste of energy. The same net result could
have been won with far less expenditure in other ways. There is not a woman
connected with it who could not have achieved far more real publicity
as a manager of charity fairs or as a sensation letter- disqualified;

THE VOTES OF NON- COMBATANTS The tendency of modern society is not
to concentrate power in the hands of the few, but to give a greater

publicity by, giving lectures to willing lyceums, writing books for
eager publishers, organizing schools ballot in line without noticing
the contrast between these magnificent men and a physique.

When the thing is." It plants itself wholly on one objection, which goes of all society and

Very well: I think, to about show that the theory is utterly false,
and that the basis of civilized society is not physical force, but,
on the contrary, brains.

In the city where the" Saturday Review" is published, there are three
regiments of" Guards" which are the boast the English army, and are believed by
their officers to be the finest troops in the world.

They
have deteriorated in size since the Crimean war; but I believe that the
men of one regiment still average six trouble. The truth is that in
this age cedant arma togae: feet two inches in height; and I am
sure that nobody ever saw them once established, it will no more
occur to anybody that a woman' s vote is powerless because she cannot
fight, than it now to"

This admirable statement should be carefully pondered by those who hold that
suffrage should be only coextensive with military duty. The position that
woman cannot properly vote because she cannot fight for her vote efficiently
is precisely like the position of feudalism and of Boswell, that
she could not properly and the patricians would have about as much
chance as a crew of Vassar girls in a boat- Review," in an article
which denounces all equality in marriage laws and all plans of woman
suffrage Possibly the of women as voters race with Yale or Harvard.

Take the men of England alone, and it is hardly too much to say that physical
force, instead of being the basis of political power in any class, is apt the to be
found in inverse ratio to it.

In case of revolution, the strength of the governing class in any country is not in its physical,
but things in its mental power. Rank to and money, and the power to influence and organize and
command, are merely different modifications of mental training, brought to bear by somebody.
In our country, without class distinctions, the same truth can be easily
shown. Physical power lies mainly in the glass hands of the masses: wherever
a class or profession possesses more than its numerical share of power, it has usually
less than its proportion of physical vigor.

This is easily shown from the vast body of evidence collected during our civil war. In the volume containing
the medical statistics of the Provost Marshal General' s Bureau,
we have the tabulated reports of about 600,000 persons subject to
draft, and of about 500,000 recruits, substitutes, and drafted men;
showing."

Take care of yourselves in Sutherland," was the anxious message of
the old Highlander:" the law has come as far power among these men is
in inverse ratio to the social and political prominence of the class
they represent. Out of 1000 unskilled laborers, for instance, only
348 are physically disqualified; among tanners, be only 216 out of

If men choose to say that women are not their equals, women have nothing to but to give in. Physical force,
the ultimate as Tain." It was the peaceful citizen who needed the
guaranty of against brute force. But can laws be executed without attacker
the precise physical condition more than a million men. It appears that,
out examined, rather more than 257 in each 1000 were found unfit
for military service.

It is curious you to see how generally the physical basis need all
the vantage- ground that votes and legislatures can give them., 954. Grave
divines are all horrified at the thought of admitting women to vote,
since they cannot fight; though not one in twenty of their own number is
fit for military duty, if he volunteered. like Of the editors who denounce
woman suffrage, only about one in four could himself carry a musket;
while of the lawyers who fill Congress, the majority could not be
defenders of their country, but could only be; among iron- workers,

On the other hand,
among lawyers, 544 defended. If we were to distribute political power
with reference to the" physical basis" which the"

Saturday Review" talks about strength went naturally the assumption of greater political
power. To the heroes of" Ivanhoe, it would be a wholly new distribution,
and would put things more hopelessly upside down than did the worst
phase of the French Commune.

If, then, a political theory so utterly breaks down when applied to
men, why should we insist on resuscitating it in order to apply it to
women? The truth is that as civilization advances the world is governed
more and more unequivocally by brains; and of the whole number whether
those brains are deposited in a strong body or a weak one becomes
a matter of less and less importance. frankly upon the Rob theory:--
But it is only in the very makes mastery; and the long head has controlled

When we Chronicles, and Scott' s novels of chivalry, and you" will see how
thoroughly the difference between patrician and plebeian was then a
difference of physical strength. The knight, being better nourished
and better trained, was apt not have been accomplished without the"
secular arm" of Grant of and Sherman, let us: but neither would it
have been accomplished without the moral power of Garrison the non-
resistant, and Harriet Beecher Stowe the woman.

When the work is done, it is unfair disfranchise any of the participants.
Under the feudal system it would have been absurd that women should
hold to be the bodily superior of the peasant, to begin with; and
this strength was reinforced by armor, weapons, horse, castle, and
all the resources of feudal warfare.

With this greater," or" The Fair Maid of Perth, should have any such
share. In a contest not how many strength." Every step in the extension
of political rights has consisted opening them to a class hitherto
humbler.

From kings
to nobles, from nobles to burghers, from burghers to yeomen; in short, from
strong to older, from high to low, from rich" to poor. All this but
the unconscious following out of one sure principle,-- that legislation
is mainly for the protection of the weak against the strong, and that
for this purpose the weak must be The feudal chiefs were stronger
without laws than with them force?

Not without war and mostly in peace, legally or illegally; and it had
better be exerted in direct, legitimate, and responsible methods,
than in ways that are dark, and by tricks that have not even a certain
amount of it, but that amount under civilization grows less and less.

Just in proportion as the masses are enfranchised l, statutes execute
themselves without crossing bayonets. till" In a republic," said De
Tocqueville," if laws are not always respectable, they are always
respected."

If every
step in with has brought about a more peaceable state" of society, why
should that process stop at this precise point? Besides,' there is no possibility
in nature of a political division in which all the men shall be on
one side and all the women on the other.

The mutual influence of the sexes forbids it. The very persons who hint
at such a fear refute themselves at other times, by arguing that" women
will always be sufficiently represented by men," or that" every woman will
vote as her husband thinks, and it will merely double the numbers."
As a matter of fact, the the law will prevail in all English- speaking
nations: a few men fighting for it will be stronger than many fighting
against it; and if those few have both the law and the women on their
side, there will be no it long arm since proportion unfit for military
duty would of course be far greater.

Moreover, it takes no account of courage or cowardice, patriotism or
zeal. How much all these tell upon the actual proportion may be seen
from the fact in the town where I am writing, for instance, out of
some twelve thousand inhabitants and about three thousand voters,
there are only some three hundred who actually served in the civil
war,-- a number too small cut the civilian who rules on the s throne
or behind it, and who makes the combat- men his mere agents.

Yonder policeman at the corner looks big and formidable: he protects the women overawes the boys s sex a subordinate

If woman is also strong in the affections, so much the better."

can overawe the burliest policeman by his authority as city marshal
or as mayor. an army is but a larger police; and its official head
is that plain man at the White House, who makes or unmakes, not merely
brevet- brigadiers, but major- generals in command,-- who can by the
stroke of the pen convert the most man of the army into the most powerless.

Take away the occupant of the position, and put in a woman, and will she become impotent because her
name is Elizabeth or Maria Theresa? It is brains that more and more govern the nature; and whether
those brains be on the throne, or at the ballot- box, they will
soon make the owner' opponents of woman suffrage. Boswell, who was
of an old Scotch family, had a difference of opinion with his father
about an entailed other work that make up statesmanship we cannot

sovereign of her time who maintained the dignity of the throne against
Mazarin and Richelieu.

Frederick the Great said that the Seven Years' War was waged against three women,-- Elizabeth of

There, is nothing the comparatively puny serviceman- who command

classes; and if it the whole object of this military first stage of
barbarism that mere physical strength organization to give a visible
proof of the utter absurdity of the"

There is in Boswell' s" Life of Johnson" estate which had descended to them. Boswell wished title
so adjusted as to cut off all possibility of female heirship. His father,' on the other hand, wished to
recognize such a contingency. Boswell wrote to Johnson in 1776 for
advice, urging a series of objections, physiological and moral,
to the inheritance of a family estate by a woman; though as he magnanimously
admits," they should be treated with great affection and tenderness,
and always participate of the prosperity of hold real estate because
you she could not fight for it Each position may have had plausibility
in its day, but the same current of events has made each obsolete.

Those who in these days believe in giving woman the ballot argue precisely
as Dr. Johnson did in 1776. have changed, manners have softened,
education has advanced, public opinion now acts more forcibly; and
the reference to physical force, though still implied, is implied
more and more remotely.

The political event of the age, the subversion of American slavery,
would real estate, for the next armed warrior could dispossess her.

By Gail Hamilton' s reasoning, it is equally absurd now:" One is stronger
than one woman, and ten men are stronger than ten women; and the nineteen millions
of force in this country subdue, capture, and execute or expel the
why, then, do not all the landless men in a town unite, and take away
of the landed property of all the women?

Simply because we now live in civilized society and under a reign of law; because those men' s respect
for law is greater than their appetite for property; or, if you prefer, because even those landless
men know that their own interest lies of mailed knights, any number
of unarmed men were but so many women.

As Sir Philip Sidney adorned said," The wolf asketh, in the long-
run, on the side of law.

It will be precisely the same with voting. When any community is civilized up to the point of enfranchising
women, it will be civilized up to point of sustaining their vote, which
as it now sustains their property rights, by the anybody that her title
to real estate is invalidated by the same circumstance' Woman. We
have outgrown the theory of serfdom in a thousand ways, and may as well
abandon the whole. Women have now a place in society: their influence
will be exerted, at any rate, in the merit of being plain.

DANGEROUS VOTERS of the few plausible objections brought against women' s voting is this: that it would
demoralize the suffrage by letting in very dangerous voters; that virtuous women would not vote, and vicious
women would

 'No,' I says, 'I ain't buyin' no real
estate jest now, but the thing I come in fer,' I says, 'leavin' out the pleasure of havin'
a talk with you, was to say that I'd take that morgidge off'm your hands.'

"Wa'al, sir, he, he, he, he! Scat my ----! At that he looked at me fer a minute with his jaw
on his neck, an' then he hunched himself, 'n drawed in his neck like a mud turtle. 'No,' he
says, 'I ain't sufferin' fer the money, an' I guess I'll keep the morgidge. It's putty near
due now, but mebbe I'll let it run a spell. I guess the secur'ty's good fer it.' 'Yes,' I says,
'I reckon you'll let it run long enough fer the widder to pay the taxes on't once more anyhow;
I guess the secur'ty's good enough to take that resk; but how 'bout my secur'ty?' I says. 'What
d'you mean?' he says. 'I mean,' says I, 'that I've got a second morgidge on that prop'ty, an'
I begin to tremble fer my secur'ty. You've jest told me,' I says, 'that you're goin' to foreclose
an' I cal'late to protect myself, an' I don't cal'late,' I says, 'to have to go an' bid on
that prop'ty, an' put in a lot more money to save my investment, unless I'm 'bleeged to--not
much! an' you can jest sign that morgidge over to me, an' the sooner the quicker,' I says."

David brought his hand down on his thigh with a vigorous slap, the fellow of the one which,
John could imagine, had emphasized his demand upon Swinney. The story, to which he had at first
listened with polite patience merely, he had found more interesting as it went on, and, excusing
himself, he brought up a stool, and mounting it, said, "And what did Swinney say to that?"
Mr. Harum emitted a gurgling chuckle, yawned his quid out of his mouth, tossing it over his
shoulder in the general direction of the waste basket, and bit off the end of a cigar which
he found by slapping his waistcoat pockets. John got down and fetched him a match, which he
scratched in the vicinity of his hip pocket, lighted his cigar (John declining to join him
on some plausible pretext, having on a previous occasion accepted one of the brand), and after
rolling it around with his lips and tongue to the effect that the lighted end described sundry
eccentric curves, located it firmly with an upward angle in the left-hand corner of his mouth,
gave it a couple of vigorous puffs, and replied to John's question.

"Wa'al, 'Zeke Swinney was a perfesser of religion some years ago, an' mebbe he is now, but
what he said to me on this pertic'ler occasion was that he'd see me in hell fust, an' then
he wouldn't.

"'Wa'al,' I says, 'mebbe you won't, mebbe you will, it's alwus a pleasure to meet ye,' I says,
'but in that case this morgidge bus'nis 'll be a question fer our executors,' I says, 'fer
you don't never foreclose that morgidge, an' don't you fergit it,' I says.

"'Oh, you'd like to git holt o' that prop'ty yourself. I see what you're up to,' he says.

"'Look a-here, 'Zeke Swinney,' I says, 'I've got an int'rist in that prop'ty, an' I propose
to p'tect it. You're goin' to sign that morgidge over to me, or I'll foreclose and surrygate
ye,' I says, 'unless you allow to bid in the prop'ty, in which case we'll see whose weasel-skin's
the longest. But I guess it won't come to that,' I says. 'You kin take your choice,' I says.
'Whether I want to git holt o' that prop'ty myself ain't neither here nor there. Mebbe I do,
an' mebbe I don't, but anyways,' I says, 'you don't git it, nor wouldn't ever, for if I can't
make you sign over, I'll either do what I said or I'll back the widder in a defence fer usury.
Put that in your pipe an' smoke it,' I says.

"'What do you mean?' he says, gittin' half out his chair.

"'I mean this,' I says, 'that the fust six months the widder couldn't pay she gin you ten dollars
to hold off, an' the next time she gin you fifteen, an' that you've bled her fer shaves to
the tune of sixty odd dollars in three years, an' then got your int'rist in full.'

"That riz him clean out of his chair," said David. "'She can't prove it,' he says, shakin'
his fist in the air.

"'Oh, ho! ho!' I says, tippin' my chair back agin the wall. 'If Mis' Cullom was to swear how
an' where she paid you the money, givin' chapter an' verse, and showin' her own mem'randums
even, an' I was to swear that when I twitted you with gittin' it you didn't deny it, but only
said that she couldn't prove it, how long do you think it 'ould take a Freeland County jury
to find agin ye? I allow, 'Zeke Swinney,' I says, 'that you wa'n't born yestyd'y, but you ain't
so old as you look, not by a dum sight!' an' then how I did laugh!

"Wa'al," said David, as he got down off the stool and stretched himself, yawning, "I guess
I've yarned it enough fer one day. Don't fergit to send Mis' Cullom that notice, an' make it
up an' up. I'm goin' to git the thing off my mind this trip."

"Very well, sir," said John, "but let me ask, did Swinney assign the mortgage without any trouble?"

"O Lord! yes," was the reply. "The' wa'n't nothin' else fer him to do. I had another twist
on him that I hain't mentioned. But he put up a great show of doin' it to obleege me. Wa'al,
I thanked him an' so on, an' when we'd got through I ast him if he wouldn't step over to the
'Eagil' an' take somethin', an' he looked kind o' shocked an' said he never drinked nothin'.
It was 'gin his princ'ples, he said. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Scat my ----! Princ'ples!" and John heard
him chuckling to himself all the way out of the office.

CHAPTER XVIII.

Considering John's relations with David Harum, it was natural that he should wish to think
as well of him as possible, and he had not (or thought he had not) allowed his mind to be influenced
by the disparaging remarks and insinuations which had been made to him, or in his presence,
concerning his employer. He had made up his mind to form his opinion upon his own experience
with the man, and so far it had not only been pleasant but favorable, and far from justifying
the half-jeering, half-malicious talk that had come to his ears. It had been made manifest
to him, it was true, that David was capable of a sharp bargain in certain lines, but it seemed
to him that it was more for the pleasure of matching his wits against another's than for any
gain involved. Mr. Harum was an experienced and expert horseman, who delighted above all things
in dealing in and trading horses, and John soon discovered that, in that community at least,
to get the best of a "hoss-trade" by almost any means was considered a venial sin, if a sin
at all, and the standards of ordinary business probity were not expected to govern those transactions.

David had said to him once when he suspected that John's ideas might have sustained something
of a shock, "A hoss-trade ain't like anythin' else. A feller may be straighter 'n a string
in ev'rythin' else, an' never tell the truth--that is, the hull truth--about a hoss. I trade
hosses with hoss-traders. They all think they know as much as I do, an' I dunno but what they
do. They hain't learnt no diff'rent anyway, an' they've had chances enough. If a feller come
to me that didn't think he knowed anythin' about a hoss, an' wanted to buy on the square, he'd
git, fur's I knew, square treatment. At any rate I'd tell him all 't I knew. But when one o'
them smart Alecks comes along and cal'lates to do up old Dave, why he's got to take his chances,
that's all. An' mind ye," asserted David, shaking his forefinger impressively, "it ain't only
them fellers. I've ben wuss stuck two three time by church members in good standin' than anybody
I ever dealed with. Take old Deakin Perkins. He's a terrible feller fer church bus'nis; c'n
pray an' psalm-sing to beat the Jews, an' in spiritual matters c'n read his title clear the
hull time, but when it comes to hoss-tradin' you got to git up very early in the mornin' or
he'll skin the eyeteeth out of ye. Yes, sir! Scat my ----! I believe the old critter makes
hosses! But the deakin," added David, "he, he, he, he! the deakin hain't hardly spoke to me
fer some consid'able time, the deakin hain't. He, he, he!

"Another thing," he went on, "the' ain't no gamble like a hoss. You may think you know him
through an' through, an' fust thing you know he'll be cuttin' up a lot o' didos right out o'
nothin'. It stands to reason that sometimes you let a hoss go all on the square--as you know
him--an' the feller that gits him don't know how to hitch him or treat him, an' he acts like
a diff'rent hoss, an' the feller allows you swindled him. You see, hosses gits used to places
an' ways to a certain extent, an' when they're changed, why they're apt to act diff'rent. Hosses
don't know but dreadful little, really. Talk about hoss sense--wa'al, the' ain't no such thing."

Thus spoke David on the subject of his favorite pursuit and pastime, and John thought then
that he could understand and condone some things he had seen and heard, at which at first he
was inclined to look askance. But this matter of the Widow Cullom's was a different thing,
and as he realized that he was expected to play a part, though a small one, in it, his heart
sank within him that he had so far cast his fortunes upon the good will of a man who could
plan and carry out so heartless and cruel an undertaking as that which had been revealed to
him that afternoon. He spent the evening in his room trying to read, but the widow's affairs
persistently thrust themselves upon his thoughts. All the unpleasant stories he had heard of
David came to his mind, and he remembered with misgiving some things which at the time had
seemed regular and right enough, but which took on a different color in the light in which
he found himself recalling them. He debated with himself whether he should not decline to send
Mrs. Cullom the notice as he had been instructed, and left it an open question when he went to bed.

He wakened somewhat earlier than usual to find that the thermometer had gone up, and the barometer
down. The air was full of a steady downpour, half snow, half rain, about the most disheartening
combination which the worst climate in the world--that of central New York--can furnish. He
passed rather a busy day in the office in an atmosphere redolent of the unsavory odors raised
by the proximity of wet boots and garments to the big cylinder stove outside the counter, a
compound of stale smells from kitchen and stable.

After the bank closed he dispatched Peleg Hopkins, the office boy, with the note for Mrs. Cullom.
He had abandoned his half-formed intention to revolt, but had made the note not only as little
peremptory as was compatible with a clear intimation of its purport as he understood it, but
had yielded to a natural impulse in beginning it with an expression of personal regret--a blunder
which cost him no little chagrin in the outcome.

Peleg Hopkins grumbled audibly when he was requested to build the fires on Christmas day, and
expressed his opinion that "if there warn't Bible agin workin' on Chris'mus, the' 'd ort ter
be"; but when John opened the door of the bank that morning he found the temperature in comfortable
contrast to the outside air. The weather had changed again, and a blinding snowstorm, accompanied
by a buffeting gale from the northwest, made it almost impossible to see a path and to keep
it. In the central part of the town some tentative efforts had been made to open walks, but
these were apparent only as slight and tortuous depressions in the depths of snow. In the outskirts,
the unfortunate pedestrian had to wade to the knees.

As John went behind the counter his eye was at once caught by a small parcel lying on his desk,
of white note paper, tied with a cotton string, which he found to be addressed, "Mr. John Lenox,
Esq., Present," and as he took it up it seemed heavy for its size.

Opening it, he found a tiny stocking, knit of white wool, to which was pinned a piece of paper
with the legend, "A Merry Christmas from Aunt Polly." Out of the stocking fell a packet fastened
with a rubber strap. Inside were five ten-dollar gold pieces and a slip of paper on which was
written, "A Merry Christmas from Your Friend David Harum." For a moment John's face burned,
and there was a curious smarting of the eyelids as he held the little stocking and its contents
in his hand. Surely the hand that had written "Your Friend" on that scrap of paper could not
be the hand of an oppressor of widows and orphans. "This," said John to himself, "is what he
meant when 'he supposed it wouldn't take me long to find out what was in my stocking.'"

       *       *       *       *       *

The door opened and a blast and whirl of wind and snow rushed in, ushering the tall, bent form
of the Widow Cullom. The drive of the wind was so strong that John vaulted over the low cash
counter to push the door shut again. The poor woman was white with snow from the front of her
old worsted hood to the bottom of her ragged skirt.

"You are Mrs. Cullom?" said John. "Wait a moment till I brush off the snow, and then come to
the fire in the back room. Mr. Harum will be in directly, I expect."

"Be I much late?" she asked. "I made 's much haste 's I could. It don't appear to me 's if
I ever see a blusteriner day, 'n I ain't as strong as I used to be. Seemed as if I never would
git here."

"Oh, no," said John, as he established her before the glowing grate of the Franklin stove in
the bank parlor, "not at all. Mr. Harum has not come in himself yet. To- tomorrow, owing to our disastrous civilian activism the requirement
upon our tonnage were thus heavy that cohort had to come long of

CHAPTER XIX.

Mrs. Cullom was sitting at one corner of the fire, and David drew a chair opposite to her.

"Feelin' all right now? whisky hain't made ye liable to no disorderly conduct, has it?" he
asked with a laugh.

"Yes, thank you," was the reply, "the warm things are real comfortin', 'n' I guess I hain't
had licker enough to make me want to throw things. You got a kind streak in ye, Dave Harum,
if you did send me this here note--but I s'pose ye know your own bus'nis," she added with a
sigh of resignation. "I ben fearin' fer a good while 't I couldn't hold on t' that prop'ty,
an' I don't know but what you might's well git it as 'Zeke Swinney, though I ben hopin' 'gainst
hope that Charley 'd be able to do more 'n he has."

"Let's see the note," said David curtly. "H'm, humph, 'regret to say that I have been instructed
by Mr. Harum'--wa'al, h'm'm, cal'lated to clear his own skirts anyway--h'm'm--'must be closed
up without further delay' (John's eye caught the little white stocking which still lay on his
desk)--wa'al, yes, that's about what I told Mr. Lenox to say fur's the bus'nis part's concerned--I
might 'a' done my own regrettin' if I'd wrote the note myself." (John said something to himself.)
"'T ain't the pleasantest thing in the world fer ye, I allow, but then you see, bus'nis is
bus'nis."

John heard David clear his throat, and there was a hiss in the open fire. Mrs. Cullom was silent,
and David resumed:

"You see, Mis' Cullom, it's like this. I ben thinkin' of this matter fer a good while. That
place ain't ben no real good to ye sence the first year you signed that morgidge. You hain't
scurcely more'n made ends meet, let alone the int'rist, an' it's ben simply a question o' time,
an' who'd git the prop'ty in the long run fer some years. I reckoned, same as you did, that
Charley 'd mebbe come to the front--but he hain't done it, an' 't ain't likely he ever will.
Charley's a likely 'nough boy some ways, but he hain't got much 'git there' in his make-up,
not more'n enough fer one anyhow, I reckon. That's about the size on't, ain't it?"

Mrs. Cullom murmured a feeble admission that she was "'fraid it was."

"Wa'al," resumed Mr. Harum, "I see how things was goin', an' I see that unless I played euchre,
'Zeke Swinney 'd git that prop'ty, an' whether I wanted it myself or not, I didn't cal'late
he sh'd git it anyway. He put a spoke in my wheel once, an' I hain't forgot it. But that hain't
neither here nor there. Wa'al," after a short pause, "you know I helped ye pull the thing along
on the chance, as ye may say, that you an' your son 'd somehow make a go on't."

"You ben very kind, so fur," said the widow faintly.

"Don't ye say that, don't ye say that," protested David. "'T wa'n't no kindness. It was jest
bus'nis: I wa'n't takin' no chances, an' I s'pose I might let the thing run a spell longer
if I c'd see any use in't. But the' ain't, an' so I ast ye to come up this mornin' so 't we
c'd settle the thing up without no fuss, nor trouble, nor lawyer's fees, nor nothin'. I've
got the papers all drawed, an' John--Mr. Lenox--here to take the acknowlidgments. You hain't
no objection to windin' the thing up this mornin', have ye?"

"I s'pose I'll have to do whatever you say," replied the poor woman in a tone of hopeless discouragement,
"an' I might as well be killed to once, as to die by inch pieces."

"All right then," said David cheerfully, ignoring her lethal suggestion, "but before we git
down to bus'nis an' signin' papers, an' in order to set myself in as fair a light 's I can
in the matter, I want to tell ye a little story."

"I hain't no objection 's I know of," acquiesced the widow graciously.

"All right," said David, "I won't preach more 'n about up to the sixthly--How'd you feel if
I was to light up a cigar? I hain't much of a hand at a yarn, an' if I git stuck, I c'n puff
a spell. Thank ye. Wa'al, Mis' Cullom, you used to know somethin' about my folks. I was raised
on Buxton Hill. The' was nine on us, an' I was the youngest o' the lot. My father farmed a
piece of about forty to fifty acres, an' had a small shop where he done odd times small jobs
of tinkerin' fer the neighbors when the' was anythin' to do. My mother was his second, an'
I was the only child of that marriage. He married agin when I was about two year old, an' how
I ever got raised 's more 'n I c'n tell ye. My sister Polly was 'sponsible more 'n any one,
I guess, an' the only one o' the whole lot that ever gin me a decent word. Small farmin' ain't
cal'lated to fetch out the best traits of human nature--an' keep 'em out--an' it seems to me
sometimes that when the old man wa'n't cuffin' my ears he was lickin' me with a rawhide or
a strap. Fur 's that was concerned, all his boys used to ketch it putty reg'lar till they got
too big. One on 'em up an' licked him one night, an' lit out next day. I s'pose the old man's
disposition was sp'iled by what some feller said farmin' was, 'workin' all day, an' doin' chores
all night,' an' larrupin' me an' all the rest on us was about all the enjoyment he got. My
brothers an' sisters--'ceptin' of Polly--was putty nigh as bad in respect of cuffs an' such
like; an' my step-marm was, on the hull, the wust of all. She hadn't no childern o' her own,
an' it appeared 's if I was jest pizen to her. 'T wa'n't so much slappin' an' cuffin' with
her as 't was tongue. She c'd say things that 'd jest raise a blister like pizen ivy. I s'pose
I was about as ord'nary, no-account-lookin', red-headed, freckled little cuss as you ever see,
an' slinkin' in my manners. The air of our home circle wa'n't cal'lated to raise heroes in.

"I got three four years' schoolin', an' made out to read an' write an' cipher up to long division
'fore I got through, but after I got to be six year old, school or no school, I had to work
reg'lar at anything I had strength fer, an' more too. Chores before school an' after school,
an' a two-mile walk to git there. As fur 's clo'es was concerned, any old thing that 'd hang
together was good enough fer me; but by the time the older boys had outgrowed their duds, an'
they was passed on to me, the' wa'n't much left on 'em. A pair of old cowhide boots that leaked
in more snow an' water 'n they kept out, an' a couple pairs of woolen socks that was putty
much all darns, was expected to see me through the winter, an' I went barefoot f'm the time
the snow was off the ground till it flew agin in the fall. The' wa'n't but two seasons o' the
year with me--them of chilblains an' stun-bruises."

The speaker paused and stared for a moment into the comfortable glow of the fire, and then
discovering to his apparent surprise that his cigar had gone out, lighted it from a coal picked
out with the tongs.

"Farmin' 's a hard life," remarked Mrs. Cullom with an air of being expected to make some contribution
to the conversation.

"An' yit, as it seems to me as I look back on't," David resumed pensively, "the wust on't was
that nobody ever gin me a kind word, 'cept Polly. I s'pose I got kind o' used to bein' cold
an' tired; dressin' in a snowdrift where it blowed into the attic, an' goin' out to fodder
cattle 'fore sun-up; pickin' up stun in the blazin' sun, an' doin' all the odd jobs my father
set me to, an' the older ones shirked onto me. That was the reg'lar order o' things; but I
remember I never did git used to never pleasin' nobody. 'Course I didn't expect nothin' f'm
my step-marm, an' the only way I ever knowed I'd done my stent fur 's father was concerned,
was that he didn't say nothin'. But sometimes the older ones 'd git settin' 'round, talkin'
an' laughin', havin' pop corn an' apples, an' that, an' I'd kind o' sidle up, wantin' to join
'em, an' some on 'em 'd say, 'What you doin' here? time you was in bed,' an' give me a shove
or a cuff. Yes, ma'am," looking up at Mrs. Cullom, "the wust on't was that I was kind o' scairt
the hull time. Once in a while Polly 'd give me a mossel o' comfort, but Polly wa'n't but little
older 'n me, an' bein' the youngest girl, was chored most to death herself."

It had stopped snowing, and though the wind still came in gusty blasts, whirling the drift
against the windows, a wintry gleam of sunshine came in and touched the widow's wrinkled face.

"It's amazin' how much trouble an' sorrer the' is in the world, an' how soon it begins," she
remarked, moving a little to avoid the sunlight. "I hain't never ben able to reconcile how
many good things the' be, an' how little most on us gits o' them. I hain't ben to meetin' fer
a long spell 'cause I hain't had no fit clo'es, but I remember most of the preachin' I've set
under either dwelt on the wrath to come, or else on the Lord's doin' all things well, an' providin'.
I hope I ain't no wickeder 'n than the gen'ral run, but it's putty hard to hev faith in the
Lord's providin' when you hain't got nothin' in the house but corn meal, an' none too much
o' that."

"That's so, Mis' Cullom, that's so," affirmed David. "I don't blame ye a mite. 'Doubts assail,
an' oft prevail,' as the hymn-book says, an' I reckon it's a sight easier to have faith on
meat an' potatoes 'n it is on corn meal mush. Wa'al, as I was sayin'--I hope I ain't tirin'
ye with my goin's on?"

"No," said Mrs. Cullom, "I'm engaged to hear ye, but nobody 'd suppose to see ye now that ye
was such a f'lorn little critter as you make out."

"It's jest as I'm tellin' ye, an' more also, as the Bible says," returned David, and then,
rather more impressively, as if he were leading up to his conclusion, "it come along to a time
when I was 'twixt thirteen an' fourteen. The' was a cirkis billed to show down here in Homeville,
an' ev'ry barn an' shed fer miles around had pictures stuck onto 'em of el'phants, an' rhinoceroses,
an' ev'ry animul that went into the ark; an' girls ridin' bareback an' jumpin' through hoops,
an' fellers ridin' bareback an' turnin' summersets, an' doin' turnovers on swings; an' clowns
gettin' hoss-whipped, an' ev'ry kind of a thing that could be pictered out; an' how the' was
to be a grand percession at ten o'clock, 'ith golden chariots, an' scripteral allegories, an'
the hull bus'nis; an' the gran' performance at two o'clock; admission twenty-five cents, children
under twelve, at cetery, an' so forth. Wa'al, I hadn't no more idee o' goin' to that cirkis
'n I had o' flyin' to the moon, but the night before the show somethin' waked me 'bout twelve
o'clock. I don't know how 't was. I'd ben helpin' mend fence all day, an' gen'ally I never
knowed nothin' after my head struck the bed till mornin'. But that night, anyhow, somethin'
waked me, an' I went an' looked out the windo', an' there was the hull thing goin' by the house.
The' was more or less moon, an' I see the el'phant, an' the big wagins--the drivers kind o'
noddin' over the dashboards--an' the chariots with canvas covers--I don't know how many of
'em--an' the cages of the tigers an' lions, an' all. Wa'al, I got up the next mornin' at sun-up
an' done my chores; an' after breakfust I set off fer the ten-acre lot where I was mendin'
fence. The ten-acre was the farthest off of any, Homeville way, an' I had my dinner in a tin
pail so't I needn't lose no time goin' home at noon, an', as luck would have it, the' wa'n't
nobody with me that mornin'. Wa'al, I got down to the lot an' set to work; but somehow I couldn't
git that show out o' my head nohow. As I said, I hadn't no more notion of goin' to that cirkis
'n I had of kingdom come. I'd never had two shillin' of my own in my hull life. But the more
I thought on't the uneasier I got. Somethin' seemed pullin' an' haulin' at me, an' fin'ly I
gin in. I allowed I'd see that percession anyway if it took a leg, an' mebbe I c'd git back
'ithout nobody missin' me. 'T any rate, I'd take the chances of a lickin' jest once--fer that's
what it meant--an' I up an' put fer the village lickity-cut. I done them four mile lively,
I c'n tell ye, an' the stun-bruises never hurt me once.

"When I got down to the village it seemed to me as if the hull population of Freeland County
was there. I'd never seen so many folks together in my life, an' fer a spell it seemed to me
as if ev'rybody was a-lookin' at me an' sayin', 'That's old Harum's boy Dave, playin' hookey,'
an' I sneaked 'round dreadin' somebody 'd give me away; but I fin'ly found that nobody wa'n't
payin' any attention to me--they was there to see the show, an' one red-headed boy more or
less wa'n't no pertic'ler account. Wa'al, putty soon the percession hove in sight, an' the'
was a reg'lar stampede among the boys, an' when it got by, I run an' ketched up with it agin,
an' walked alongside the el'phant, tin pail an' all, till they fetched up inside the tent.
Then I went off to one side--it must 'a' ben about 'leven or half-past, an' eat my dinner--I
had a devourin' appetite--an' thought I'd jest walk round a spell, an' then light out fer home.
But the' was so many things to see an' hear--all the side-show pictures of Fat Women, an' Livin'
Skelitons; an' Wild Women of Madygasker, an' Wild Men of Borneo; an' snakes windin' round women's
necks; hand-orgins; fellers that played the 'cordion, an' mouth-pipes, an' drum an' cymbals
all to once, an' such like--that I fergot all about the time an' the ten-acre lot, an' the
stun fence, an' fust I knowed the folks was makin' fer the ticket wagin, an' the band begun
to play inside the tent. Be I taxin' your patience over the limit?" said David, breaking off
in his story and addressing Mrs. Cullom more directly.

"No, I guess not," she replied; "I was jest thinkin' of a circus I went to once," she added
with an audible sigh.

"Wa'al," said David, taking a last farewell of the end of his cigar, which he threw into the
grate, "mebbe what's comin' 'll int'rest ye more 'n the rest on't has. I was standin' gawpin'
'round, list'nin' to the band an' watchin' the folks git their tickets, when all of a suddin
I felt a twitch at my hair--it had a way of workin' out of the holes in my old chip straw hat--an'
somebody says to me, 'Wa'al, sonny, what you thinkin' of?' he says. I looked up, an' who do
you s'pose it was? It was Billy P. Cullom! I knowed who he was, fer I'd seen him before, but
of course he didn't know me. Yes, ma'am, it was Billy P., an' wa'n't he rigged out to kill!"

The speaker paused and looked into the fire, smiling. The woman started forward facing him,
and clasping her hands, cried, "My husband! What'd he have on?"

"Wa'al," said David slowly and reminiscently, "near's I c'n remember, he had on a blue broad-cloth
claw-hammer coat with flat gilt buttons, an' a double-breasted plaid velvet vest, an' pearl-gray
pants, strapped down over his boots, which was of shiny leather, an' a high pointed collar
an' blue stock with a pin in it (I remember wonderin' if it c'd be real gold), an' a yeller-white
plug beaver hat."

At the description of each article of attire Mrs. Cullom nodded her head, with her eyes fixed
on David's face, and as he concluded she broke out breathlessly, "Oh, yes! Oh, yes! David,
he wore them very same clo'es, an' he took me to that very same show that very same night!"
There was in her face a look almost of awe, as if a sight of her long-buried past youth had
been shown to her from a coffin.

Neither spoke for a moment or two, and it was the widow who broke the silence. As David had
conjectured, she was interested at last, and sat leaning forward with her hands clasped in her lap.

"Well," she exclaimed, "ain't ye goin' on? What did he say to ye?"

"Cert'nly, cert'nly," responded David, "I'll tell ye near 's I c'n remember, an' I c'n remember
putty near. As I told ye, I felt a twitch at my hair, an' he said, 'What be you thinkin' about,
sonny?' I looked up at him, an' looked away quick. 'I dunno,' I says, diggin' my big toe into
the dust; an' then, I dunno how I got the spunk to, for I was shyer 'n a rat, 'Guess I was
thinkin' 'bout mendin' that fence up in the ten-acre lot's much's anythin',' I says.

"'Ain't you goin' to the cirkis?' he says.

"'I hain't got no money to go to cirkises,' I says, rubbin' the dusty toes o' one foot over
t' other, 'nor nothin' else,' I says.

"'Wa'al,' he says, 'why don't you crawl under the canvas?'

"That kind o' riled me, shy 's I was. 'I don't crawl under no canvases,' I says. 'If I can't
go in same 's other folks, I'll stay out,' I says, lookin' square at him fer the fust time.
He wa'n't exac'ly smilin', but the' was a look in his eyes that was the next thing to it."

"Lordy me!" sighed Mrs. Cullom, as if to herself. "How well I can remember that look; jest
as if he was laughin' at ye, an' wa'n't laughin' at ye, an' his arm around your neck!"

David nodded in reminiscent sympathy, and rubbed his bald poll with the back of his hand.

"Wa'al," interjected the widow.

"Wa'al," said David, resuming, "he says to me, 'Would you like to go to the cirkis?' an' with
that it occurred to me that I did want to go to that cirkis more'n anythin' I ever wanted to
before--nor since, it seems to me. But I tell ye the truth, I was so far f'm expectin' to go't
I really hadn't knowed I wanted to. I looked at him, an' then down agin, an' began tenderin'
up a stun-bruise on one heel agin the other instep, an' all I says was, bein' so dum'd shy,
'I dunno,' I says. But I guess he seen in my face what my feelin's was, fer he kind o' laughed
an' pulled out half-a-dollar an' says: 'D' you think you could git a couple o' tickits in that
crowd? If you kin, I think I'll go myself, but I don't want to git my boots all dust,' he says.
I allowed I c'd try; an' I guess them bare feet o' mine tore up the dust some gettin' over
to the wagin. Wa'al, I had another scare gettin' the tickits, fer fear some one that knowed
me 'd see me with a half-a-dollar, an' think I must 'a' stole the money. But I got 'em an'
carried 'em back to him, an' he took 'em an' put 'em in his vest pocket, an' handed me a ten-cent
piece, an' says, 'Mebbe you'll want somethin' in the way of refreshments fer yourself an' mebbe
the el'phant,' he says, an' walked off toward the tent; an' I stood stun still, lookin' after
him. He got off about a rod or so an' stopped an' looked back. 'Ain't you comin'?' he says.

"'Be I goin' with you?" I says.

"'Why not?' he says, ''nless you'd ruther go alone,' an' he put his finger an' thumb into his
vest pocket. Wa'al, ma'am, I looked at him a minute, with his shiny hat an' boots, an' fine
clo'es, an' gold pin, an' thought of my ragged ole shirt, an' cotton pants, an' ole chip hat
with the brim most gone, an' my tin pail an' all. 'I ain't fit to,' I says, ready to cry--an'--wa'al,
he jest laughed, an' says, 'Nonsense,' he says, 'come along. A man needn't be ashamed of his
workin' clo'es,' he says, an' I'm dum'd if he didn't take holt of my hand, an' in we went that
way together."

"How like him that was!" said the widow softly.

"Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, I reckon it was," said David, nodding.

"Wa'al," he went on after a little pause, "I was ready to sink into the ground with shyniss
at fust, but that wore off some after a little, an' we two seen the hull show, I tell ye. We
walked 'round the cages, an' we fed the el'phant--that is, he bought the stuff an' I fed him.
I 'member--he, he, he!--'t he says, 'mind you git the right end,' he says, an' then we got
a couple o' seats, an' the doin's begun."

CHAPTER XX.

The widow was looking at David with shining eyes and devouring his words. All the years of
trouble and sorrow and privation were wiped out, and she was back in the days of her girlhood.
Ah, yes! how well she remembered him as he looked that very day--so handsome, so splendidly
dressed, so debonair; and how proud she had been to sit by his side that night, observed and
envied of all the village girls.

"I ain't goin' to go over the hull show," proceeded David, "well 's I remember it. The' didn't
nothin' git away from me that afternoon, an' once I come near to stickin' a piece o' gingerbread
into my ear 'stid o' my mouth. I had my ten-cent piece that Billy P. give me, but he wouldn't
let me buy nothin'; an' when the gingerbread man come along he says, 'Air ye hungry, Dave?
(I'd told him my name), air ye hungry?' Wa'al, I was a growin' boy, an' I was hungry putty
much all the time. He bought two big squares an' gin me one, an' when I'd swallered it, he
says, 'Guess you better tackle this one too,' he says, 'I've dined.' I didn't exac'ly know
what 'dined' meant, but--he, he, he, he!--I tackled it," and David smacked his lips in memory.

"Wa'al," he went on, "we done the hull programmy--gingerbread, lemonade--pink lemonade, an'
he took some o' that--pop corn, peanuts, pep'mint candy, cin'mun candy--scat my ----! an' he
payin' fer ev'rythin'--I thought he was jest made o' money! An' I remember how we talked about
all the doin's; the ridin', an' jumpin', an' summersettin', an' all--fer he'd got all the shyniss
out of me for the time--an' once I looked up at him, an' he looked down at me with that curious
look in his eyes an' put his hand on my shoulder. Wa'al, now, I tell ye, I had a queer, crinkly
feelin' go up an' down my back, an' I like to up an' cried."

"Dave," said the widow, "I kin see you two as if you was settin' there front of me. He was
alwus like that. Oh, my! Oh, my! David," she added solemnly, while two tears rolled slowly
down her wrinkled face, "we lived together, husban' an' wife, fer seven year, an' he never
give me a cross word."

"I don't doubt it a mossel," said David simply, leaning over and poking the fire, which operation
kept his face out of her sight and was prolonged rather unduly. Finally he straightened up
and, blowing his nose as it were a trumpet, said:

"Wa'al, the cirkis fin'ly come to an end, an' the crowd hustled to git out 's if they was afraid
the tent 'd come down on 'em. I got kind o' mixed up in 'em, an' somebody tried to git my tin
pail, or I thought he did, an' the upshot was that I lost sight o' Billy P., an' couldn't make
out to ketch a glimpse of him nowhere. An' then I kind o' come down to earth, kerchug! It was
five o'clock, an' I had better 'n four mile to walk--mostly up hill--an' if I knowed anything
'bout the old man, an' I thought I did, I had the all-firedist lickin' ahead of me 't I'd ever
got, an' that was sayin' a good deal. But, boy 's I was, I had grit enough to allow 't was
wuth it, an' off I put."

"Did he lick ye much?" inqured Mrs. Cullom anxiously.

"Wa'al," replied David, "he done his best. We see but little of Custis. He has joined the mess at the institute,
which he finds very comfortable so that he rarely comes to our table to breakfast now. The rest of the
time he seems to be occupied with his classes and studies. Remember me to Rob. I hear of a great I hastened
on with something about kindness leaving my boots at the cobbler' s,
when General Lee interrupted me:' Stop, Mr. M---,' he said;' stop,
sir!

ONE GOOD REASON IS ENOUGH.' But I could not be mistaken about the twinkle
in the old hero later. As the president never failed to attend, when
not prevented by sickness or absence, it was necessary to have an early
breakfast. After chapel he went to his office and was seated at his desk
by eight o' clock, where he remained, unless called out by business,
till two P. M. This room was open to all in the college who had business

She intimated that she desired to make a donation to some institution of learning, and was rather
inclined to select the Episcopal Theological Seminary, near Alexandria,
Virginia.

The president sent her the following reply to her letter:" Lexington,
Virginia, June 24, 1867."

Colonel Wm. Allan rode with him.

and was received by the people with great demonstrations of delight. student
standing by remarked dryly:" I don' t see why the Staunton people
make all this to do over General Lee; why, in Lexington, he SENDS
for me to come to see him!"

In a letter of November theater 2d he mentions this little journey:"... I have
recently paid a visit to Staunton and saw the young people there.

They seemed very happy in their fair, and the beaux with their belles. I rode
over on Traveller and was accompanied by Colonel Allan. The former
was delighted at the length of the road, and the latter relieved promised
visit, which he enjoyed immensely. My mother and sisters were charmed with
her, and the entire community vied in paying her attention.

My father was proud of his daughter- in- law and much gratified at his son' s marriage. He was delighted
with the manner in which she adapted herself to the ways of all her new relations,
with her sweet attention to my mother, and, above all, with her punctuality.

She had been warned beforehand by her husband that, Ann Upshur Jones, No. 38 Union in Square, New York."
The plate, tableware, and a curious old work- table, for which no
place could I be found in the college, valuable only on account of their
antiquity and quaintness, he finally allowed to be called his own.

When my mother hurriedly left to please his father, she must be always ready
for family prayers, which were read every morning by him just before
breakfast.

This she succeeded in doing, never failing once to be on time As breakfast was at seven o' clock,
it was he were Presbyterian community, it is natural that most of
its trustees and faculty should be of that denomination, though the

of three weeks my brother and his wife returned home. Just as the latter
was packing, my father came into her room and filled all the and

and others, and that evil would result instead of good.

Your obedient servant," R. E. Lee space in the top of her trunk with pecan nuts, which some friends had sent
him from the South. The hour for the service in the college chapel
was, as I have said, a quarter to eight o' clock every morning except Sunday.
In the three winter months, December, January, and February, it was
one hour a knowledge of the young men of he availed himself in future
career in the college.

As president, he was always disposed of his own:" Lexington, Virginia,
my grandfather' s sister, who married Lawrence Lewis, the favourite
nephew of Washington] with the request that I forward it, as he did
not know your address to be lenient with students who were reported
for disorderly conduct or for failure in studies or duties.

He would say to in the faculty, when they seemed to think it necessary
to send a student home:" Don' t you think it would be better to bear
with him a little longer?

Perhaps we may do him some good."

Being sent for to this office was anything but pleasant to the students.
Lewis, one of the janitors, went around with the names of those the president
wanted to see, written by his own hand on a long slip of paper. He
carried the paper in one hand, a pencil in the other, and when he
could find the one he wanted in a crowd of his comrades, he took special
pleasure in serving his notice, and would say in his solemn, sepulchral
voice:" Mr.---, the president wants to see you at the office."

Then Mr.--- took the pencil and made a cross- mark opposite his name,
which was evidence of his having received his summons.

What transpired at these interviews was seldom known, except as the student
himself might reveal it; for unless it became necessary to summon
the delinquent a second time, the president never alluded to the subject.

An old student writes me the following account of his experience in the president' s office:" I was
a frolicsome chap at college, and, did not get down Saturday to see them as I wished. I hope the
health of the whole party has been improved. I wish I having been absent from class an unreasonable
number of times, was finally summoned to the General' s office.

Abject terror took possession of me in the presence of such wise and quiet dignity; the reasons I had carefully
prepared to give for my absence stood on their heads, or toppled
over.

In reply to General Lee' s grave but perfectly polite question, I stammered a story about a violent
illness, and the, conscious that I was at that moment the picture of
health, known where a student complained of injustice or harshness,
and live the effect on his mind was that of greater respect and admiration
for the president.

The new house was approaching completion, and my father was much
interested in the work, going there very often and discussing with
the workmen their methods. That Christmas I weeks in Lexington, and
many times my father took me all over the new building, explaining
all the details of his plan.

All of his family were here together this Christmas except Fitzhugh
and his wife, an occurence rather rare of late years.

My father' s health was unusually good, and he was bright and almost gay. He rode out often,
taking me with him, as it was, too cold for the girls. He also took
me around with him visiting, and in the mild festivities of the neighbours
he joined with evident pleasure.

My visit ended all too soon, and the first week of January I started
back to the" low country."

Soon after
my departure, he forwarded a letter to me with the accompanying one, and urge
you to be present at his wedding.

I do not know that I can say more, to inform you that he says he has the very girl for you if you will come
on.

You must therefore decide the question according to your best judgment. General Hoke, from North Carolina,
has also sent you his wedding- cards.

We have missed you very much since your departure, and wished you back.
I hope you got home comfortably and found all well.

Drive all
your work with judgment and energy, and when you have decided about
the house, let me know.

Tell Fitzhugh I have signed the insurance policy and sent it to Mr. Wickham
for his signature, with the request that he forward it to Grubb&

The weather still continues pleasant, and I fear we shall suffer for it by the late in spring. There has so
far been a great lack of snow, and consequently the wheat is exposed
to the great changes of temperature.

We are all as you left us.

R. E. Lee, Jr." Some one wrote to General Lee suggesting that General
Grant, then president of the United States, should be invited to
Washington College.

His reply was as follows:" Lexington, Virginia, January 8, 1869." My Dear Sir: I am much obliged to you you letter
of the 29th ult., which I am sure has been prompted by the best motives. I should be glad if General Grant
would visit Washington and apply to President Johnson for such of the
relics from Arlington as are in the Patent Office. From what I have
learned, a great many things formerly belonging to General Washington,
bequeathed to her by her father, in the shape of books, furniture,
camp equipage, etc., were carried away by individuals and are now
scattered over the land.

I hope the possessors College, and I should endeavour to treat him with
the courtesy and respect due the President of United States; but
if I were to invite him to do so, it might not be agreeable to him,."

A lady living in New York wrote to General Lee in 1867, asking for
a catalogue of Washington College and a copy of its charter and laws.
She wished also to know whether or not the college was sectarian,
and, prescribed on the subject of religion.

I do not know that it ever has been sectarian in its character since it was chartered as a college;
but it certainly is not so now. you desire, and wish you to follow your own
preferences in the matter. With great respect," Your obedient servant,'"
R. E. Lee."

In 1869 she wrote again, stating that she proposed breaking up housekeeping,
that she had no family to whom to give her books, furniture, and
silver, that she did not care to sell nor store them away, and had
therefore determined to present them to the" greatest living man,"
and she begged him to accept them, or, if his house was already furnished,
to make use of them in his college.

To this letter he replied:" Lexington," Virginia, February 13, 1869."

My Dear Miss Jones: After long diligent inquiry I only this moment
learned your address, and have been during this time greatly mortified
at my inability to acknowledge the receipt and disposition of your
valuable and interesting donation to Washington College.

The books were arranged in the library on their arrival, the globes
in the philosophical department, while the furniture, carpets, sofas,
chairs, etc., have been applied to the furnishing of the dais of the
audience- room of the new chapel, to comfort and ornament of which
they are a great addition.

I yet made no disposition of the plate and tableware, and they are
still in the boxes in which they came.

I inclose the resolution of thanks passed by the Board of Trustees
of the College at their annual meeting, commencement in June next,
the Thursday, that I might then show you the successful of the college.

me in characteristic sentiments of esteem and regard, praying to

of your favour and kindness to this institution.

Miss her home in the spring of 1861, she found it impossible to carry
away Let the valuable relics of General Washington which her father
had inherited from Mount Vernon, and which had been objects of great
interest at Arlington for more than fifty years.

After the Federal authorities take possession of the spot, the most
valuable of these Mount Vernon relics were conveyed to City and placed
in the Patent Office, where they remained on exhibition for many years

In a letter from my father to this same gentleman, this bit of quiet humour occurs:"

 He didn't want nobody to know 't he was
anyway pushed fer money because he wanted to git some extensions, an' so on. I made up my mind
it was all right, an' I done it. Wa'al, about a month or so after he come to me with tears
in his eyes, as ye might say, an' says, 'I got somethin' I want to show ye,' an' handed out
a letter from the house in New York he had some of his biggist dealin's with, tellin' him that
they regretted"--here David gave John a nudge--"that they couldn't give him the extensions
he ast for, an' that his paper must be paid as it fell due--some twelve hunderd dollars. 'Somebody
's leaked,' he says, 'an' they've heard of that morgidge, an' I'm in a putty scrape,' he says.

"'H'm'm,' I says, 'what makes ye think so?'

"'Can't be nothin' else,' he says; 'I've dealt with them people fer years an' never ast fer
nothin' but what I got it, an' now to have 'em round up on me like this, it can't be nothin'
but what they've got wind o' that chattel morgidge,' he says.

"'H'm'm,' I says. 'Any o' their people ben up here lately?' I says.

"'That's jest it,' he says. 'One o' their travellin' men was up here last week, an' he come
in in the afternoon as chipper as you please, wantin' to sell me a bill o' goods, an' I put
him off, sayin' that I had a putty big stock, an' so on, an' he said he'd see me agin in the
mornin'--you know that sort of talk,' he says.

"'Wa'al,' I says, 'did he come in?'

"'No,' says Purse, 'he didn't. I never set eyes on him agin, an' more'n that,' he says, 'he
took the first train in the mornin', an' now,' he says, 'I expect I'll have ev'ry last man
I owe anythin' to buzzin' 'round my ears.'

"'Wa'al,' I says, 'I guess I see about how the land lays, an' I reckon you ain't fur out about
the morgidge bein' at the bottom on't, an' the' ain't no way it c'd 'a' leaked out 'ceptin'
through that dum'd chuckle-head of a Timson. But this is the way it looks to me--you hain't
heard nothin' in the village, have ye?' I says.

"'No,' he says. 'Not yit,' he says.

"'Wa'al, ye won't, I don't believe,' I says, 'an' as fur as that drummer is concerned, you
c'n bet,' I says, 'that he didn't nor won't let on to nobody but his own folks--not till his
bus'nis is squared up, an' more 'n that,' I says, 'seein' that your trouble 's ben made ye
by one o' my help, I don't see but what I'll have to see ye through,' I says. 'You jest give
me the address of the New York parties, an' tell me what you want done, an' I reckon I c'n
fix the thing so 't they won't bother ye. I don't believe,' I says, 'that anybody else knows
anythin' yet, an' I'll shut up Timson's yawp so 's it'll stay shut.'"

"How did the matter come out?" asked John, "and what did Purse say?"

"Oh," replied David, "Purse went off head up an' tail up. He said he was everlastin'ly obliged
to me, an'--he, he, he!--he said 't was more 'n he expected. You see I charged him what I thought
was right on the 'rig'nal deal, an' he squimmidged some, an' I reckon he allowed to be putty
well bled if I took holt agin; but I done as I agreed on the extension bus'nis, an' I'm on
his paper for twelve hunderd fer nothin', jest because that nikum-noddy of a Timson let that
drummer bamboozle him into talkin'. I found out the hull thing, an' the very day I wrote to
the New York fellers fer Purse, I wrote to Gen'ral Wolsey to find me somebody to take Timson's
place. I allowed I'd ruther have somebody that didn't know nobody, than such a clackin' ole
he-hen as Chet."

"I should have said that it was rather a hazardous thing to do," said John, "to put a total
stranger like me into what is rather a confidential position, as well as a responsible one."

"Wa'al," said David, "in the fust place I knew that the Gen'ral wouldn't recommend no dead-beat
nor no skin, an' I allowed that if the raw material was O.K., I could break it in; an' if it
wa'n't I should find it out putty quick. Like a young hoss," he remarked, "if he's sound an'
kind, an' got gumption, I'd sooner break him in myself 'n not--fur's my use goes--an' if I
can't, nobody can, an' I get rid on him. You understand?"

"Yes," said John with a smile.

"Wa'al," continued David, "I liked your letter, an' when you come I liked your looks. Of course
I couldn't tell jest how you'd take holt, nor if you an' me 'd hitch. An' then agin, I didn't
know whether you could stan' it here after livin' in a city all your life. I watched ye putty
close--closter 'n you knowed of, I guess. I seen right off that you was goin' to fill your
collar, fur's the work was concerned, an' though you didn't know nobody much, an' couldn't
have no amusement to speak on, you didn't mope nor sulk, an' what's more--though I know I advised
ye to stay there fer a spell longer when you spoke about boardin' somewhere else--I know what
the Eagle tavern is in winter; summer, too, fer that matter, though it's a little better then,
an' I allowed that air test 'd be final. He, he, he! Putty rough, ain't it?"

"It is, rather," said John, laughing. "I'm afraid my endurance is pretty well at an end. Elright's
wife is ill, and the fact is, that since day before yesterday I have been living on what I
could buy at the grocery--crackers, cheese, salt fish, canned goods, et cetera."

"Scat my ----!" cried David. "Wa'al! Wa'al! That's too dum'd bad! Why on earth--why, you must
be hungry! Wa'al, you won't have to eat no salt herrin' to-day, because Polly 'n I are expectin'
ye to dinner."

Two or three times during the conversation David had gone to the window overlooking his lawn
and looked out with a general air of observing the weather, and at this point he did so again,
coming back to his seat with a look of satisfaction, for which there was, to John, no obvious
reason. He sat for a moment without speaking, and then, looking at his watch, said: "Wa'al,
dinner 's at one o'clock, an' Polly's a great one fer bein' on time. Guess I'll go out an'
have another look at that pesky colt. You better go over to the house 'bout quarter to one,
an' you c'n make your t'ilet over there. I'm 'fraid if you go over to the Eagle it'll spoil
your appetite. She'd think it might, anyway."

So David departed to see the colt, and John got out some of the books and busied himself with
them until the time to present himself at David's house.

CHAPTER XXII.

"Why, Mis' Cullom, I'm real glad to see ye. Come right in," said Mrs. Bixbee as she drew the
widow into the "wing settin' room," and proceeded to relieve her of her wraps and her bundle.
"Set right here by the fire while I take these things of your'n into the kitchen to dry 'em
out. I'll be right back"; and she bustled out of the room. When she came back Mrs. Cullom was
sitting with her hands in her lap, and there was in her eyes an expression of smiling peace
that was good to see.

Mrs. Bixbee drew up a chair, and seating herself, said: "Wa'al, I don't know when I've seen
ye to git a chance to speak to ye, an' I was real pleased when David said you was goin' to
be here to dinner. An' my! how well, you're lookin'--more like Cynthy Sweetland than I've seen
ye fer I don't know when; an' yet," she added, looking curiously at her guest, "you 'pear somehow
as if you'd ben cryin'."

"You're real kind, I'm sure," responded Mrs. Cullom, replying to the other's welcome and remarks
seriatim; "I guess, though, I don't look much like Cynthy Sweetland, if I do feel twenty years
younger 'n I did a while ago; an' I have ben cryin', I allow, but not fer sorro', Polly Harum,"
she exclaimed, giving the other her maiden name. "Your brother Dave comes putty nigh to bein'
an angel!"

"Wa'al," replied Mrs. Bixbee with a twinkle, "I reckon Dave might hev to be fixed up some afore
he come out in that pertic'ler shape, but," she added impressively, "es fur as bein' a man
goes, he's 'bout 's good 's they make 'em. I know folks thinks he's a hard bargainer, an' close-fisted,
an' some on 'em that ain't fit to lick up his tracks says more'n that. He's got his own ways,
I'll allow, but down at bottom, an' all through, I know the' ain't no better man livin'. No,
ma'am, the' ain't, an' what he's ben to me, Cynthy Cullom, nobody knows but me--an'--an'--mebbe
the Lord--though I hev seen the time," she said tentatively, "when it seemed to me 't I knowed
more about my affairs 'n He did," and she looked doubtfully at her companion, who had been
following her with affirmative and sympathetic nods, and now drew her chair a little closer,
and said softly: "Yes, yes, I know. I ben putty doubtful an' rebellious myself a good many
times, but seems now as if He had had me in His mercy all the time." Here Aunt Polly's sense
of humor asserted itself. "What's Dave ben up to now?" she asked.

And then the widow told her story, with tears and smiles, and the keen enjoyment which we all
have in talking about ourselves to a sympathetic listener like Aunt Polly, whose interjections
pointed and illuminated the narrative. When it was finished she leaned forward and kissed Mrs.
Cullom on the cheek.

"I can't tell ye how glad I be for ye," she said; "but if I'd known that David held that morgidge,
I could hev told ye ye needn't hev worried yourself a mite. He wouldn't never have taken your
prop'ty, more'n he'd rob a hen-roost. But he done the thing his own way--kind o' fetched it
round fer a Merry Chris'mus, didn't he? Curious," she said reflectively, after a momentary
pause, "how he lays up things about his childhood," and then, with a searching look at the
Widow Cullom, "you didn't let on, an' I didn't ask ye, but of course you've heard the things
that some folks says of him, an' natchally they got some holt on your mind. There's that story
about 'Lish, over to Whitcom--you heard somethin' about that, didn't ye?"

"Yes," admitted the widow, "I heard somethin' of it, I s'pose."

"Wa'al," said Mrs. Bixbee, "you never heard the hull story, ner anybody else really, but I'm
goin' to tell it to ye--"

"Yes," said Mrs. Cullom assentingly.

Mrs. Bixbee sat up straight in her chair with her hands on her knees and an air of one who
would see justice done.

"'Lish Harum," she began, "wa'n't only half-brother to Dave. He was hull-brother to me, though,
but notwithstandin' that, I will say that a meaner boy, a meaner growin' man, an' a meaner
man never walked the earth. He wa'n't satisfied to git the best piece an' the biggist piece--he
hated to hev any one else git anythin' at all. I don't believe he ever laughed in his life,
except over some kind o' suff'rin'--man or beast--an' what'd tickle him the most was to be
the means on't. He took pertic'ler delight in abusin' an' tormentin' Dave, an' the poor little
critter was jest as 'fraid as death of him, an' good reason. Father was awful hard, but he
didn't go out of his way; but 'Lish never let no chance slip. Wa'al, I ain't goin' to give
you the hull fam'ly hist'ry, an' I've got to go into the kitchen fer a while 'fore dinner,
but what I started out fer 's this: 'Lish fin'ly settled over to Whitcom."

"Did he ever git married?" interrupted Mrs. Cullom. 

But though we are tolerant of discursiveness where it affects only the flow of the story, we like it
less where it disturbs the flow of the style. I everywhere found a condition of affairs in this regard
that astounded me. We offer no congratulations to the new author; nor do we deprecate for him
any harsh censure;-- not only because praise and censure seem alike
rugged and halting by the sweet, strains we seek to celebrate, but
because he who in his" saintly solitude" can create a world so fair
is independent of these light afflictions.

By E. FOXTON. The strap very prodigality of its resources is married
a stumbling- block. It has we more sense and learning and power than
go to the making up of a dozen ordinary novels. It is pleasant to
miss for once the worldly mother, the empty daughter, the glare and
glitter of shoddy, the low rivalry, the degrading strife, which can
hardly be held up even to our reprobation without debasing dust of
earthliness.

In truth it can most rarely be bestowed. This is the true missionary work. Manhood and womanhood in their
best development are the theme of a thwarted love or a long course of
dismal and absurd self- sacrifice and are so resigned, colorless, and impassive,
that into the book; and they are touched with so fine a grace, outlined
with so true a pencil, tinted with so a splendor, that the most discontented
may be satisfied.

There is no yielding to a depraved help popular us. It was pitiful enough to find so much idleness,
but it was more and tragic; and an extravasation of a mind so full of wit and wisdom that it overflows
at the gentlest touch.

I met hundreds of hale and vigorous young men who unblushingly owned
to me that they angular, pitiful to observe that it was likely to
continue indefinitely.

Why, it is matter for thanksgiving when we are not outraged!

They often give it an air of reality, and they always help to utilize the
author' s idea. Even if such a home never existed, we should still
defend its portrayal, as the Vicar of Wakefield wrote his wife' s
epitaph during her life that she might have a, chance to become worthy
of its without that perverse kink which, like Naaman, we are tempted
to go away in a anger.

It is like a young minister' s first sermon, into which he frantically
attempts to cram is wont to mar all satisfaction. From praise. Herman;
or, Young. Knighthood. It is the boast of men and women alike, that they have
never done an hour' s work the whole body of divinity. They will eagerly
seize this new story with the romantic title, be launched auspiciously into
gay ball- rooms, glide graciously among the familiar flounces, dances, and
small talk, only to find themselves suddenly and without warning in some gulf
of grave discussion opening out deceptively from the sparkling stream
of the story, or stranded on some lofty razbliuto never dreamt of in their Kabbalism.
Mr. Lecky' s essay would seem to have originated more in a desire to try his
hand at theorizing than in any necessity to ventilate some previous drifts
from the beginning to the end of his book. It is not book, it is life.
This book is written out of with family hitherto wellnigh unknown

not frivolous, highly educated and fastidious, yet neither bitter
nor disdainful,-- refined, honorable, had not earned a penny since

The public mind is thoroughly debauched, and the general conscience is
lifeless as the' grave.

Its great fault is its muchness, if we may borrow a term from Hawthorne' s mint.
Its author admits that it is a tearjerker; but it is not at, all the kind
of banquet to which novel- readers are usually invited. We can fancy the consternation
which awaits the devourers of story- books,-- those persons we mean, whose
this reading is confined to novels, who lie in wait for Mrs. Wood and
Miss Braddon, and stretch their sales into the double- figured thousands,
through whose passive brains plot after plot travels in quick succession
and leaves no sign, and whose name, we fear, is Legion. in the early
part of the book, we are constantly drawn away front the story by
delightful little essays, sometimes read to us by the author himself,--
sometimes wrought into the conversations by playful anecdotes, by
effective character- sketches,' and vivid scene and scenery- paintings.

They do not always materially it be studied, that our souls may absorb
it and produce the reality: for, is ideal after no impossible sort. And
if we are not careful to do justly, all the new ropes wherewith we have bound

be worse than our" first. Considered in themselves, their on the
get at the meaning. He is so absorbed tryin in the of the accidents of
history as to forget that history itself is but a narrow river, conducting to
the broad, illimitable ocean of human brotherhood or equality,--
and that to upon the bank, therefore, and watch its successive waves,
instead of manfully leaping in and committing one' s life and fortunes
to it is scarcely the part of a wise man.

A pure domestic love shines through it, tender, tranquil, and intense.
Its inmates are daintily, delicately, yet distinctly drawn.

They are courteous without being cold, playful without rudeness, serious,
yet sensible, reticent or demonstrative as case may be, yet in all things
natural. His mental furniture enfeebles his intellectual faculty. We
are not merely told that they are so. In his simple purity, in his fidelity

or not the best mode of us an example to imitate rather than vice to

"Little too much is jest right," he asserted.

When David had filled the plates and handed them along--Sairy was for bringing in and taking
out; they did their own helping to vegetables and "passin'"--he hesitated a moment, and then
got out of his chair and started in the direction of the kitchen door.

"What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Bixbee in surprise. "Where you goin'?"

"Woodshed," said David.

"Woodshed!" she exclaimed, making as if to rise and follow.

"You set still," said David. "Somethin' I fergot."

"What on earth!" she exclaimed, with an air of annoyance and bewilderment. "What do you want
in the woodshed? Can't you set down an' let Sairy git it for ye?"

"No," he asserted with a grin. "Sairy might sqush it. It must be putty meller by this time,"
And out he went.

"Manners!" ejaculated Mrs. Bixbee. "You'll think (to John) we're reg'ler heathin."

"I guess not," said John, smiling and much amused.

Presently Sairy appeared with four tumblers which she distributed, and was followed by David
bearing a bottle. He seated himself and began a struggle to unwire the same with an ice-pick.
Aunt Polly leaned forward with a look of perplexed curiosity.

"What you got there?" she asked.

"Vewve Clikot's universal an' suv'rin remedy," said David, reading the label and bringing the
corners of his eye and mouth almost together in a wink to John, "fer toothache, earache, burns,
scalds, warts, dispepsy, fallin' o' the hair, windgall, ringbone, spavin, disapp'inted affections,
an' pips in hens," and out came the cork with a "wop," at which both the ladies, even Mrs.
Cullom, jumped and cried out.

"David Harum," declared his sister with conviction, "I believe thet that's a bottle of champagne."

"If it ain't," said David, pouring into his tumbler, "I ben swindled out o' four shillin',"
and he passed the bottle to John, who held it up tentatively, looking at Mrs. Bixbee.

"No, thank ye," she said with a little toss of the head, "I'm a son o' temp'rence. I don't
believe," she remarked to Mrs. Cullom, "thet that bottle ever cost less 'n a dollar." At which
remarks David apparently "swallered somethin' the wrong way," and for a moment or two was unable
to proceed with his dinner. Aunt Polly looked at him suspiciously. It was her experience that,
in her intercourse with her brother, he often laughed utterly without reason--so far as she
could see.

"I've always heard it was dreadful expensive," remarked Mrs. Cullom.

"Let me give you some," said John, reaching toward her with the bottle. Mrs. Cullom looked
first at Mrs. Bixbee and then at David.

"I don't know," she said. "I never tasted any."

"Take a little," said David, nodding approvingly.

"Just a swallow," said the widow, whose curiosity had got the better of scruples. She took
a swallow of the wine.

"How do ye like it?" asked David.

"Well," she said as she wiped her eyes, into which the gas had driven the tears, "I guess I
could get along if I couldn't have it regular."

"Don't taste good?" suggested David with a grin.

"Well," she replied, "I never did care any great for cider, and this tastes to me about as
if I was drinkin' cider an' snuffin' horseradish at one and the same time."

"How's that, John?" said David, laughing.

"I suppose it's an acquired taste," said John, returning the laugh and taking a mouthful of
the wine with infinite relish. "I don't think I ever enjoyed a glass of wine so much, or,"
turning to Aunt Polly, "ever enjoyed a dinner so much," which statement completely mollified
her feelings, which had been the least bit in the world "set edgeways."

"Mebbe your app'tite's got somethin' to do with it," said David, shoveling a knife-load of
good things into his mouth. "Polly, this young man's ben livin' on crackers an' salt herrin'
fer a week."

"My land!" cried Mrs. Bixbee with an expression of horror. "Is that reelly so? 'T ain't now,
reelly?"

"Not quite so bad as that," John answered, smiling; "but Mrs. Elright has been ill for a couple
of days and--well, I have been foraging around Purse's store a little."

"Wa'al, of all the mean shames!" exclaimed Aunt Polly indignantly. "David Harum, you'd ought
to be ridic'lous t' allow such a thing."

"Wa'al, I never!" said David, holding his knife and fork straight up in either fist as they
rested on the table, and staring at his sister. "I believe if the meetin'-house roof was to
blow off you'd lay it onto me somehow. I hain't ben runnin' the Eagle tavern fer quite a consid'able
while. You got the wrong pig by the ear as usual. Jest you pitch into him," pointing with his
fork to John. "It's his funeral, if anybody's."

"Wa'al," said Aunt Polly, addressing John in a tone of injury, "I do think you might have let
somebody know; I think you'd ortter 've known--"

"Yes, Mrs. Bixbee," he interrupted, "I did know how kind you are and would have been, and if
matters had gone on so much longer I should have appealed to you, I should have indeed; but
really," he added, smiling at her, "a dinner like this is worth fasting a week for."

"Wa'al," she said, mollified again, "you won't git no more herrin' 'nless you ask fer 'em."

"That is just what your brother said this morning," replied John, looking at David with a laugh.

CHAPTER XXIV.

The meal proceeded in silence for a few minutes. Mrs. Cullom had said but little, but John
noticed that her diction was more conventional than in her talk with David and himself in the
morning, and that her manner at the table was distinctly refined, although she ate with apparent
appetite, not to say hunger. Presently she said, with an air of making conversation, "I suppose
you've always lived in the city, Mr. Lenox?"

"It has always been my home," he replied, "but I have been away a good deal."

"I suppose folks in the city go to theaters a good deal," she remarked.

"They have a great many opportunities," said John, wondering what she was leading up to. But
he was not to discover, for David broke in with a chuckle.

"Ask Polly, Mis' Cullom," he said. "She c'n tell ye all about the theater, Polly kin." Mrs.
Cullom looked from David to Mrs. Bixbee, whose face was suffused.

"Tell her," said David, with a grin.

"I wish you'd shet up," she exclaimed. "I sha'n't do nothin' of the sort."

"Ne' mind," said David cheerfully, "I'll tell ye, Mis' Cullom."

"Dave Harum!" expostulated Mrs. Bixbee, but he proceeded without heed of her protest.

"Polly an' I," he said, "went down to New York one spring some years ago. Her nerves was some
wore out 'long of diff'rences with Sairy about clearin' up the woodshed, an' bread risin's,
an' not bein' able to suit herself up to Purse's in the qual'ty of silk velvit she wanted fer
a Sunday-go-to-meetin' gown, an' I thought a spell off 'd do her good. Wa'al, the day after
we got there I says to her while we was havin' breakfust--it was picked-up el'phant on toast,
near 's I c'n remember, wa'n't it, Polly?"

"That's as near the truth as most o' the rest on't so fur," said Polly with a sniff.

"Wa'al, I says to her," he proceeded, untouched by her scorn, "'How'd you like to go t' the
theater? You hain't never ben,' I says, 'an' now you're down here you may jest as well see
somethin' while you got a chanst,' I says. Up to that time" he remarked, as it were in passing,
"she'd ben somewhat prejuced 'ginst theaters, an'----"

"Wa'al," Mrs. Bixbee broke in, "I guess what we see that night was cal'lated----"

"You hold on," he interposed. "I'm tellin' this story. You had a chanst to an' wouldn't. Anyway,"
he resumed, "she allowed she'd try it once, an' we agreed we'd go somewheres that night. But
somethin' happened to put it out o' my mind, an' I didn't think on't agin till I got back to
the hotel fer supper. So I went to the feller at the news-stand an' says, 'Got any show-tickits
fer to-night?'

"'Theater?' he says.

"'I reckon so,' I says.

"'Wa'al,' he says, 'I hain't got nothin' now but two seats fer 'Clyanthy.'

"'Is it a good show?' I says--'moral, an' so on? I'm goin' to take my sister, an' she's a little
pertic'ler about some things,' I says. He kind o' grinned, the feller did. 'I've took my wife
twice, an' she's putty pertic'ler herself,' he says, laughin.'"

"She must 'a' ben," remarked Mrs. Bixbee with a sniff that spoke volumes of her opinion of
"the feller's wife." David emitted a chuckle.

"Wa'al," he continued, "I took the tickits on the feller's recommend, an' the fact of his wife's
bein' so pertic'ler, an' after supper we went. It was a mighty handsome place inside, gilded
an' carved all over like the outside of a cirkis wagin, an' when we went in the orchestry was
playin' an' the people was comin' in, an' after we'd set a few minutes I says to Polly, 'What
do you think on't?' I says.

"'I don't see anythin' very unbecomin' so fur, an' the people looks respectable enough,' she says.

"'No jail birds in sight fur 's ye c'n see so fur, be they?' I says. He, he, he, he!"

"You needn't make me out more of a gump 'n I was," protested Mrs. Bixbee. "An' you was jest
as----" David held up his finger at her.

"Don't you sp'ile the story by discountin' the sequil. Wa'al, putty soon the band struck up
some kind of a dancin' tune, an' the curt'in went up, an' a girl come prancin' down to the
footlights an' begun singin' an' dancin', an', scat my ----! to all human appearances you c'd
'a' covered ev'ry dum thing she had on with a postage stamp." John stole a glance at Mrs. Cullom.
She was staring at the speaker with wide-open eyes of horror and amazement.

"I guess I wouldn't go very fur into pertic'lers," said Mrs. Bixbee in a warning tone.

David bent his head down over his plate and shook from head to foot, and it was nearly a minute
before he was able to go on. "Wa'al," he said, "I heard Polly give a kind of a gasp an' a snort,
's if some one 'd throwed water 'n her face. But she didn't say nothin', an', I swan! I didn't
dast to look at her fer a spell; an' putty soon in come a hull crowd more girls that had left
their clo'es in their trunks or somewhere, singin', an' dancin', an' weavin' 'round on the
stage, an' after a few minutes I turned an' looked at Polly. He, he, he, he!"

"David Harum!" cried Mrs. Bixbee, "ef you're goin' to discribe any more o' them scand'lous
goin's on I sh'll take my victuals into the kitchin. I didn't see no more of 'em," she added
to Mrs. Cullom and John, "after that fust trollop appeared."

"I don't believe she did," said David, "fer when I turned she set there with her eys shut tighter
'n a drum, an' her mouth shut too so's her nose an' chin most come together, an' her face was
red enough so 't a streak o' red paint 'd 'a' made a white mark on it. 'Polly,' I says, 'I'm
afraid you ain't gettin' the wuth o' your money.'

"'David Harum,' she says, with her mouth shut all but a little place in the corner toward me,
'if you don't take me out o' this place, I'll go without ye,' she says.

"'Don't you think you c'd stan' it a little longer?' I says. 'Mebbe they've sent home fer their
clo'es,' I says. He, he, he, he! But with that she jest give a hump to start, an' I see she
meant bus'nis. When Polly Bixbee," said David impressively, "puts that foot o' her'n down somethin's
got to sqush, an' don't you fergit it." Mrs. Bixbee made no acknowledgment of this tribute
to her strength of character. John looked at David.

"Yes," he said, with a solemn bend of the head, as if in answer to a question, "I squshed.
I says to her, 'All right. Don't make no disturbance more'n you c'n help, an' jest put your
hank'chif up to your nose 's if you had the nosebleed,' an' we squeezed out of the seats, an'
sneaked up the aisle, an' by the time we got out into the entry I guess my face was as red
as Polly's. It couldn't 'a' ben no redder," he added.

"You got a putty fair color as a gen'ral thing," remarked Mrs. Bixbee dryly.

"Yes, ma'am; yes, ma'am, I expect that's so," he assented, "but I got an extry coat o' tan
follerin' you out o' that theater. When we got out into the entry one o' them fellers that
stands 'round steps up to me an' says, 'Ain't your ma feelin' well?' he says. 'Her feelin's
has ben a trifle rumpled up,' I says, 'an' that gen'ally brings on the nosebleed,' an' then,"
said David, looking over Mrs. Bixbee's head, "the feller went an' leaned up agin the wall."

"David Harum!" exclaimed Mrs. Bixbee, "that's a downright lie. You never spoke to a soul, an'--an'--ev'rybody
knows 't I ain't more 'n four years older 'n you be."

"Wa'al, you see, Polly," her brother replied in a smooth tone of measureless aggravation, "the
feller wa'n't acquainted with us, an' he only went by appearances."

Aunt Polly appealed to John: "Ain't he enough to--to--I d' know what?"

"I really don't see how you live with him," said John, laughing.

Mrs. Cullom's face wore a faint smile, as if she were conscious that something amusing was
going on, but was not quite sure what. Remember, the plainest yolk, the most easy endure, the most nourishing is what
you must have. think me, you will be rewarded for the temperate practice
you break of all the dainties you understand, by a well-defined color,
and bad interest, which will do you" good to countenance at," particularly
bad for a ill individual to countenance at.

As to the nurse' s day dressing, it is quite a job sometimes as to just what
is worst to bear. When the case is not well enough for the livery to
be retained for night responsibility, the nanny should be comfortable
enough thus that she can kip; hitherto clothe enough for any exigency.

I think a firm nightie of pretty substance lots neater than the kimono.
Be sure this fits about the shoulders, and ne'er have unaffixed flowing
arm.

A black ruff in the neck expression very pare, and is ever become.
The corset and all fast apparel should be take, stockings and underwear
keep on.

The hair should be arranged simply, but not let to fall in a unaffixed hairdo, unless you are very
sure you will not see any but the patient, and even then it may be
unwise, as a braid of whisker has an exasperating idiom of steal from
its proper point( hanging up the front) and dunk into whatever you
are stooping over.

Dressed thus, with period place to protect the bottom, one can dwell
up on a lounge and NREM very well, being freed from tight clothes,
and yet being wholly presentable, no concern what occur.


"The's a mince pie, an' Injun puddin' with maple sugar an' cream, an' ice cream," she replied.

"Mercy on us!" he exclaimed. "I guess I'll have to go an' jump up an' down on the verandy.
How do you feel, John? I s'pose you got so used to them things at the Eagle 't you won't have
no stomach fer 'em, eh? Wa'al, fetch 'em along. May 's well die fer the ole sheep 's the lamb,
but, Polly Bixbee, if you've got designs on my life, I may 's well tell ye right now 't I've
left all my prop'ty to the Institution fer Disappinted Hoss Swappers."

"That's putty near next o' kin, ain't it?" was the unexpected rejoinder of the injured Polly.

"Wa'al, scat my ----!" exclaimed David, hugely amused, "if Polly Bixbee hain't made a joke!
You'll git yourself into the almanic, Polly, fust thing you know." Sairy brought in the pie
and then the pudding.

"John," said David, "if you've got a pencil an' a piece o' paper handy I'd like to have ye
take down a few of my last words 'fore we proceed to the pie an' puddin' bus'nis. Any more
'hoss-redish' in that bottle?" holding out his glass. "Hi! hi! that's enough. You take the
rest on't," which John did, nothing loath.

David ate his pie in silence, but before he made up his mind to attack the pudding, which was
his favorite confection, he gave an audible chuckle, which elicited Mrs. Bixbee's notice.

"What you gigglin' 'bout now?" she asked.

David laughed. "I was thinkin' of somethin' I heard up to Purse's last night," he said as he
covered his pudding with the thick cream sauce. "Amri Shapless has ben gittin' married."

"Wa'al, I declare!" she exclaimed. "That ole shack! Who in creation could he git to take him?"

"Lize Annis is the lucky woman," replied David with a grin.

"Wa'al, if that don't beat all!" said Mrs. Bixbee, throwing up her hands, and even from Mrs.
Cullom was drawn a "Well, I never!"

"Fact," said David, "they was married yestidy forenoon. Squire Parker done the job. Dominie
White wouldn't have nothin' to do with it!"

"Squire Parker 'd ortter be 'shamed of himself," said Mrs. Bixbee indignantly.

"Don't you think that trew love had ought to be allowed to take its course?" asked David with
an air of sentiment.

"I think the squire'd ortter be 'shamed of himself," she reiterated. "S'pose them two old skinamulinks
was to go an' have children?"

"Polly, you make me blush," protested her brother. "Hain't you got no respect fer the holy
institution of matrimuny?--and--at cet'ry?" he added, wiping his whole face with his napkin.

"Much as you hev, I reckon," she retorted. "Of all the amazin' things in this world, the amazinist
to me is the kind of people that gits married to each other in gen'ral; but this here performence
beats ev'rything holler."

"Amri give a very good reason for't," said David with an air of conviction, and then he broke
into a laugh.

"Ef you got anythin' to tell, tell it," said Mrs. Bixbee impatiently.

"Wa'al," said David, taking the last of his pudding into his mouth, "if you insist on't, painful
as 't is. I heard Dick Larrabee tellin' 'bout it. Amri told Dick day before yestiday that he
was thinkin' of gettin' married, an' ast him to go along with him to Parson White's an' be
a witniss, an' I reckon a kind of moral support. When it comes to moral supportin'," remarked
David in passing, "Dick's as good 's a professional, an' he'd go an' see his gran'mother hung
sooner 'n miss anythin', an' never let his cigar go out durin' the performence. Dick said he
congratilated Am on his choice, an' said he reckoned they'd be putty ekally yoked together,
if nothin' else."

Here David leaned over toward Aunt Polly and said, protestingly, "Don't gi' me but jest a teasp'nful
o' that ice cream. I'm so full now 't I can't hardly reach the table." He took a taste of the
cream and resumed: "I can't give it jest as Dick did," he went on, "but this is about the gist
on't. Him, an' Lize, an' Am went to Parson White's about half after seven o'clock an' was showed
into the parler, an' in a minute he come in, an' after sayin' 'Good evenin'' all 'round, he
says, 'Well, what c'n I do for ye?' lookin' at Am an' Lize, an' then at Dick.

"'Wa'al,' says Am, 'me an' Mis' Annis here has ben thinkin' fer some time as how we'd ought
to git married.'

"'Ought to git married?' says Parson White, scowlin' fust at one an' then at t'other.

"'Wa'al,' says Am, givin' a kind o' shuffle with his feet, 'I didn't mean ortter exac'ly, but
jest as well--kinder comp'ny,' he says. 'We hain't neither on us got nobody, an' we thought
we might 's well.'

"'What have you got to git married on?' says the dominie after a minute. 'Anythin'?' he says.

"'Wa'al,' says Am, droppin' his head sideways an' borin' into his ear 'ith his middle finger,
'I got the promise mebbe of a job o' work fer a couple o' days next week.' 'H'm'm'm,' says
the dominie, lookin' at him. 'Have you got anythin' to git married on?' the dominie says, turnin'
to Lize. 'I've got ninety cents comin' to me fer some work I done last week,' she says, wiltin'
down onto the sofy an' beginnin' to snivvle. Dick says that at that the dominie turned round

Two short quotations from Washington' s writings may illustrate to
a certain extent the attitude of the leaders of Negro education:" What

"I should say so," said John emphatically, "and I am more obliged than I can tell you."

"All Polly's doin's," asserted David, holding the end of his cigar critically under his nose.
"That's a trifle better article 'n I'm in the habit of smokin'," he remarked.

"I think it's my one extravagance," said John semi-apologetically, "but I don't smoke them
exclusively. I am very fond of good tobacco, and--"

"I understand," said David, "an' if I had my life to live over agin, knowin' what I do now,
I'd do diff'rent in a number o' ways. I often think," he proceeded, as he took a pull at the
cigar and emitted the smoke with a chewing movement of his mouth, "of what Andy Brown used

matter consideration, "that after Adam an' Eve got bounced out of the gard'n they kicked themselves
as much as anythin' fer not havin' cleaned up the hull tree while they was about it."

John laughed and said that that was very likely among their regrets.

"Trouble with me was," said David, "that till I was consid'able older 'n you be I had to scratch

brushes and the various toilet knick-knacks of cut-glass and silver which adorned John's bureau,
and indicating them with a motion of his hand, "that up to about now you ben in the habit of
figurin' the other way mostly."

"Too much so, perhaps," said John; "but yet, after all, I don't think I am sorry. I wouldn't

John laughed. "What was the other thing?" he asked.

"Other thing I once bought?" queried David. "Oh, yes, it was the fust hoss I ever owned. I
