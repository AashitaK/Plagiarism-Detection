                       Neither general followed the usual custom on haranguing the whole
army. Civilis did not deploy his line, but halted them in columns,

from across the Rhine [524] near the river of the left.

Appearance of the valves of the aorta in Case 3d, Article 10.

a a The two valves thickened.

b b Bony projections, one of which extends across the cavity of the valve.

Is a representation of the fleshlike thickening of the aorta in case 7th. The valves are smaller
than usual, and their form is in some degree changed. A round spot, thickened, is seen at a
little distance from the seat of the principal disease.

Morbid changes in the organization of the heart are so frequent, as to have attracted the observation
of those, who have devoted any attention to the study of morbid anatomy. Derangements of the
primary organ of the circulation cannot exist without producing so great disorder of the functions
of that and of other parts, as to be sufficiently conspicuous by external signs; but, as these
somewhat resemble the symptoms of different complaints, especially of asthma, phthisis pulmonalis,
and water in the thorax, it has happened, that each of these has been sometimes confounded
with the former[1]. Well, as I was saying, they cook worse at Undervelier than any place I was now be
engaged-- the phrase seems familiar-- was more or less like an H. That there is, there were two high parallel ranges
bounding it, but across the middle a low ridge of Omaha, Neb. However,
I forgave him, because they were such people, and after a short and
bitter night I went out in the morning before the sun rose and took
the Moutier road.

The
valley in which I was ever in, with the possible exception of perhaps a thousand days.


    [Footnote 1: A careful examination of the works of some of
    the most eminent English practical writers does not afford
    evidence of any clear distinction of these diseases of the
    heart. Dr. Cullen, whose authority is of the highest
    estimation, evidently enumerates symptoms of them in his
    definition and description of the hydrothorax. In § 1702 Th.
    and Pr. he places much confidence on a particular sign of
    water in the chest, and remarks, that the same sign is not
    produced by the presence of pus. Now, there is no sufficient
    reason, why this symptom should not arise from the presence
    of pus, as well as from that of water; but it probably can
    depend on neither of those alone. See Morgagni de causis et
    sedibus morborum, Epist. 16. art. 11. The experienced
    Heberden says in the chapter “De palpitatione cordis,” “Hic
    affectus manifesta cognitione conjunctus est cum istis
    morbis, qui existimantur nervorum proprii esse, quique
    sanguinis missione augentur; hoc igitur remedium plerumque
    omittendum est.”—“Ubi remediis locus est, ex sunt adhibenda,
    quæ conveniunt affectibus hypochondriacis.”

    Dr. Baillie’s knowledge of morbid anatomy has enabled him to
    make nearer approaches to truth; yet it will probably be
    found, when this subject shall be fully understood, that his
    descriptions of the symptoms of diseases of the heart and of
    hydrothorax are not quite accurate, and, that with respect to
    the former, they are very imperfect.

    Some of the French physicians have devoted much attention to
    this subject; especially M. Corvisart, professor in the
    hospital of La Charite, at Paris, from whose clinical
    lectures is derived the most important information.]

                                CASE I.

The symptoms of organic disease of the heart are marked with extraordinary clearness in the
following case. The opportunity for observing them was very favourable; and there was every
incitement to close observation, which could arise from the important and interesting character
of the patient. These advantages will justify an uncommon minuteness in the detail of the case;
especially, as the most accurate knowledge of a complaint is obtained from a successive view
of its stages.

The late Governour of this commonwealth was endowed with most vigorous powers of mind and body.
At the age of sixteen he was attacked with fits of epilepsy, which first arose from a sudden
fright, received on awaking from sleep in a field, and beholding a large snake erecting its
head over him. As he advanced in life they became more frequent, and were excited by derangement
of the functions of the stomach, often by affections of the mind, by dreams, and even by the
sight of the reptile which first produced the convulsions. 

This silk is especially valuable characteristic for underwear. The cost is greater, but it outwears muslin or
linen. It is woven in different widths. For many purposes, no better textile can be taken. It is also
used for children's garments and for outside wraps.

In the beginning of the year 1807, he suffered severely from the epidemic catarrh; and a remarkable
irregularity of the pulse was then perceived to be permanent, though there is some reason to
believe, that this irregularity had previously existed, during the fits of epilepsy, and for
a few days after them. In the summer, while he was apparently in good health, the circulation
in the right arm was suddenly and totally suspended; yet, without loss of motion or sensation.
This affection lasted from noon till midnight, when it as suddenly ceased, and the circulation
was restored. In the autumn he was again seized with the influenza, which continued about three
weeks, leaving a troublesome cough of two or three months’ duration, and a slight occasional
difficulty of breathing, which at that time was not thought worth attention. Soon after, in
November, he had one or two singular attacks of catarrhal affection of the mucous membrane
of the lungs, which commenced with a sense of suffocation, succeeded by cough and an expectoration
of cream coloured mucus, to the quantity of a quart in an hour, with coldness of the extremities,
lividity of the countenance, and a deathlike moisture over the whole body. These attacks lasted
six or eight hours, were relieved by emetics, and disappeared, without leaving a trace behind.
