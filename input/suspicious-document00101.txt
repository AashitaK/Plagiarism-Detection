Our Author, John Francis Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz, Sovereign of Commercy, Prince of
Euville, second Archbishop of Paris, Abbot of Saint Denis in France, was born at Montmirail,
in Brie, in October, 1614.

His father was Philippe Emanuel de Gondi, Comte, de Joigni, General of the Galleys of France
and Knight of the King's Orders; and his mother was Frances Marguerite, daughter of the Comte
de Rochepot, Knight of the King's Orders, and of Marie de Lannoy, sovereign of Commercy and
Euville.

Pierre de Gondi, Duc de Retz, was his brother, whose daughter was the Duchesse de Lesdiguieres.

His grandfather was Albert de Gondi, Duc de Retz, Marquis de Belle Isle, a Peer of France,
Marshal and General of the Galleys, Colonel of the French Horse, First Gentleman of the Bedchamber,
and Great Chamberlain to the Kings Charles IX. and Henri III.

This history was first printed in Paris in 1705, at the expense of the Duchesse de Lesdiguieres,
the last of this noble family, whose estate fell after her decease to that of Villeroy.

His preceptor was the famous Vincent de Paul, Almoner to Queen Anne of Austria.

In 1627 he was made a Canon of the Cathedral of Paris by his uncle, Jean Francois de Gondi,
first archbishop of that city, and was not long after created a Doctor of the Sorbonne.

In 1643 he was appointed Coadjutor of the archbishopric of Paris, with the title of Archbishop
of Corinth, during which, such was his pastoral vigilance that the most important affairs of
the Church were committed to his care.

As to his general character, if we take it from his own Memoirs, he had such presence of mind,
and so dexterously improved all opportunities which fortune presented to him, that it seemed
as if he had foreseen or desired them.  He knew how to put a good gloss upon his failings,
and oftentimes verily believed he was really the man which he affected to be only in appearance.
He was a man of bright parts, but no conduct, being violent and inconstant in his intrigues
of love as well as those of politics, and so indiscreet as to boast of his successful amours
with certain ladies whom he ought not to have named.  He affected pomp and splendour, though
his profession demanded simplicity and humility.  He was continually shifting parties, being
a loyal subject one day and the next a rebel, one time a sworn enemy to the Prime Minister,
and by and by his zealous friend; always aiming to make himself formidable or necessary.  As
a pastor he had engrossed the love and confidence of the people, and as a statesman he artfully
played them off against their sovereign.  He studied characters thoroughly, and no man painted
them in truer colours more to his own purpose.  Sometimes he confesses his weaknesses, and
at other times betrays his self-flattery.

It being his fate to be imprisoned by Mazarin, first at Vincennes and then at Nantes, he made
his escape to Rome, and in 1656 retired to Franche Comte, where Cardinal Mazarin gave orders
for his being arrested; upon which he posted to Switzerland, and thence to Constance, Strasburg,
Ulm, Augsburg, Frankfort, and Cologne, to which latter place Mazarin sent men to take him dead
or alive; whereupon he retired to Holland, and made a trip from one town to another till 1661,
when, Cardinal Mazarin dying, our Cardinal went as far as Valenciennes on his way to Paris,
but was not suffered to come further; for the King and Queen-mother would not be satisfied
without his resignation of the archbishopric of Paris, to which he at last submitted upon advantageous
terms for himself and an amnesty for all his adherents.  But still the Court carried it so
severely to the Cardinal that they would not let him go and pay his last devoirs to his father
when on his dying bed.  At length, however, after abundance of solicitation, he had leave to
go and wait upon the King and Queen, who, on the death of Pope Alexander VII., sent him to
Rome to assist at the election of his successor.

No wonder that King Charles II. of England promised to intercede for the Cardinal's reestablishment;
for when the royal family were starving, as it were, in their exile at Paris, De Retz did more
for them than all the French Court put together; and, upon the King's promise to take the Roman
Catholics of England under his protection after his restoration, he sent an abbot to Rome to
solicit the Pope to lend him money, and to dispose the English Catholics in his favour.

He would fain have returned his hat to the new Pope, but his Holiness, at the solicitation
of Louis XIV., ordered him to keep it.  After this he chose a total retirement, lived with
exemplary piety, considerably retrenched his expenses, and hardly allowed himself common necessaries,
in order to save money to pay off a debt of three millions, which he had the happiness to discharge,
and to balance all accounts with the world before his death, which happened at Paris on the
24th of August, 1679, in the 65th year of his age.

HISTORIC COURT MEMOIRS.

CARDINAL DE RETZ.

BOOK I.

MADAME:--Though I have a natural aversion to give you the history of my own life, which has
been chequered with such a variety of different adventures, yet I had rather sacrifice my reputation
to the commands of a lady for whom I have so peculiar a regard than not disclose the most secret
springs of my actions and the inmost recesses of my soul.

By the caprice of fortune many mistakes of mine have turned to my credit, and I very much doubt
whether it would be prudent in me to remove the veil with which some of them are covered. 
But as I am resolved to give you a naked, impartial account of even the most minute passages
of my life ever since I have been capable of reflection, so I most humbly beg you not to be
surprised at the little art, or, rather, great disorder, with which I write my narrative, but
to consider that, though the diversity of incidents may sometimes break the thread of the history,
yet I will tell you nothing but with all that sincerity which the regard I have for you demands.
And to convince you further that I will neither add to nor diminish from the plain truth, I
shall set my name in the front of the work.

False glory and false modesty are the two rocks on which men who have written their own lives
have generally split, but which Thuanus among the moderns and Caesar among the ancients happily
escaped.  I doubt not you will do me the justice to believe that I do not pretend to compare
myself with those great writers in any respect but sincerity,--a virtue in which we are not
only permitted, but commanded, to rival the greatest heroes.

I am descended from a family illustrious in France and ancient in Italy, and born upon a day
remarkable for the taking of a monstrous sturgeon in a small river that runs through the country
of Montmirail, in Brie, the place of my nativity.

I am not so vain as to be proud of having it thought that I was ushered into the world with
a prodigy or a miracle, and I should never have mentioned this trifling circumstance had it
not been for some libels since published by my enemies, wherein they affect to make the said
sturgeon a presage of the future commotions in this kingdom, and me the chief author of them.

I beg leave to make a short reflection on the nature of the mind of man. I believe there never
was a more honest soul in the world than my father's; I might say his temper was the very essence
of virtue.  For though he saw I was too much inclined to duels and gallantry ever to make a
figure as an ecclesiastic, yet his great love for his eldest son--not the view of the archbishopric
of Paris, which was then in his family--made him resolve to devote me to the service of the
Church.  For he was so conscious of his reasons, that I could even swear he would have protested
from the very bottom of his heart that he had no other motive than the apprehension of the
dangers to which a contrary profession might expose my soul.  So true it is that nothing is
so subject to delusion as piety: all sorts of errors creep in and hide themselves under that
veil; it gives a sanction to all the turns of imagination, and the honesty of the intention
is not sufficient to guard against it.  In a word, after all I have told you, I turned priest,
though it would have been long enough first had it not been for the following accident.

The Duc de Retz, head of our family, broke at that time, by the King's order, the marriage
treaty concluded some years before between the Duc de Mercoeur--[Louis, Duc de Mercoeur, since
Cardinal de Vendome, father of the Duc de Vendome, and Grand Prior, died 1669.]--and his daughter,
and next day came to my father and agreeably surprised him by telling him he was resolved to
give her to his cousin to reunite the family.

As I knew she had a sister worth above 80,000 livres a year, I, that very instant, thought
of a double match.  I had no hopes they would think of me, knowing how things stood, so I was
resolved to provide for myself.

Having got a hint that my father did not intend to carry me to the wedding, as, foreseeing,
it may be, what happened, I pretended to be better pleased with my profession, to be touched
by what my father had so often laid before me on that subject, and I acted my part so well
that they believed I was quite another man.

My father resolved to carry me into Brittany, for the reason that I had shown no inclination
that way.  We found Mademoiselle de Retz at Beaupreau, in Anjou.  I looked on the eldest only
as my sister, but immediately considered Mademoiselle de Scepaux (so the youngest was called)
as my mistress.

I thought her very handsome, her complexion the most charming in the world, lilies and roses
in abundance, admirable eyes, a very pretty mouth, and what she wanted in stature was abundantly
made up by the prospect of 80,000 livres a year and of the Duchy of Beaupreau, and by a thousand
chimeras which I formed on these real foundations.

I played my game nicely from the beginning, and acted the ecclesiastic and the devotee both
in the journey and during my stay there; nevertheless, I paid my sighs to the fair one,--she
perceived it. I spoke at last, and she heard me, but not with that complacency which I could
have wished.

But observing she had a great kindness for an old chambermaid, sister to one of my monks of
Buzai, I did all I could to gain her, and by the means of a hundred pistoles down, and vast
promises, I succeeded.  She made her mistress believe that she was designed for a nunnery,
and I, for my part, told her that I was doomed to nothing less than a monastery.  She could
not endure her sister, because she was her father's darling, and I was not overfond of my brother,--[Pierre
de Gondi, Duc de Retz, who died in 1676.]--for the same reason.  This resemblance in our fortunes
contributed much to the uniting of our affections, which I persuaded myself were reciprocal,
and I resolved to carry her to Holland.

Indeed, there was nothing more easy, for Machecoul, whither we were come from Beaupreau, was
no more than half a league from the sea.  But money was the only thing wanting, for my treasury,
was so drained by the gift of the hundred pistoles above mentioned that I had not a sou left.
But I found a supply by telling my father that, as the farming of my abbeys was taxed with
the utmost rigour of the law, so I thought myself obliged in conscience to take the administration
of them into my own hands.  This proposal, though not pleasing, could not be rejected, both
because it was regular and because it made him in some measure believe that I would not fail
to keep my benefices, since I was willing to take care of them. I went the next day to let
Buzai,--[One of his abbeys.]--which is but five leagues from Machecoul.  I treated with a Nantes
merchant, whose name was Jucatieres, who took advantage of my eagerness, and for 4,000 crowns
ready money got a bargain that made his fortune.  I thought I had 4,000,000, and was just securing
one of the Dutch pinks, which are always in the road of Retz, when the following accident happened,
which broke all my measures.

Mademoiselle de Retz (for she had taken that name after her sister's marriage) had the finest
eyes in the world, and they never were so beautiful as when she was languishing in love, the
charms of which I never yet saw equalled.  We happened to dine at a lady's house, a league
from Machecoul, where Mademoiselle de Retz, looking in the glass at an assembly of ladies,
displayed all those tender, lively, moving airs which the Italians call 'morbidezza', or the
lover's languish.  But unfortunately she was not aware that Palluau, since Marechal de Clerambaut,
was behind her, who observed her airs, and being very much attached to Madame de Retz, with
whom he had in her tender years been very familiar, told her faithfully what he had observed.

Madame de Retz, who mortally hated her sister, disclosed it that very night to her father,
who did not fail to impart it to mine.  The next morning, at the arrival of the post from Paris,
all was in a hurry, my father pretending to have received very pressing news; and, after our
taking a slight though public leave of the ladies, my father carried me to sleep that night
at Nantes.  I was, as you may imagine, under very great surprise and concern; for I could not
guess the cause of this sudden departure.  I had nothing to reproach myself with upon the score
of my conduct; neither had I the least suspicion that Palluau had seen anything more than ordinary
till I arrived at Orleans, where the matter was cleared up, for my brother, to prevent my escape,
which I vainly attempted several times on my journey, seized my strong box, in which was my
money, and then I understood that I was betrayed; in what grief, then, I arrived at Paris,
I leave you to imagine.

I found there Equilli, Vasse's uncle, and my first cousin, who, I daresay, was one of the most
honest men of his time, and loved me from his very soul.  I apprised him of my design to run
away with Mademoiselle de Retz.  He heartily approved of my project, not only because it would
be a very advantageous match for me, but because he was persuaded that a double alliance was
necessary to secure the establishment of the family.

The Cardinal de Richelieu--[Armand Jean du Plesais, Cardinal de Richelieu, was born in 1585,
and died in 1642.]--(then Prime Minister) mortally hated the Princesse de Guemenee, because
he was persuaded she had crossed his amours with the Queen,--[Anne of Austria, eldest daughter
of Philip II., King of Spain, and wife of Louis XIII., died 1666.]--and had a hand in the trick
played him by Madame du Fargis, one of the Queen's dressing women, who showed her Majesty (Marie
de Medicis) a love-letter written by his Eminence to the Queen, her daughter-in-law. The Cardinal
pushed his resentment so far that he attempted to force the Marechal de Breze, his brother-in-law,
and captain of the King's Life-guards, to expose Madame de Guemenee's letters, which were found
in M. de Montmorency's--[Henri de Montmorency was apprehended on the 1st of September, 1632,
and beheaded in Toulouse in November of the same year.]--coffer when he was arrested at Chateau
Naudari.  But the Marechal de Breze had so much honour and generosity as to return them to
Madame de Guemenee.  He was, nevertheless, a very extravagant gentleman; but the Cardinal de
Richelieu, perceiving he had been formerly honoured by some kind of relation to him, and dreading
his angry excursions and preachments before the King, who had some consideration for his person,
bore with him very patiently for the sake of settling peace in his own family, which he passionately
longed to unite and establish, but which was the only thing out of his power, who could do
whatever else he pleased in France.  For the Marechal de Breze had conceived so strong an aversion
to M. de La Meilleraye, who was then Grand Master of the Artillery, and afterwards Marechal
de La Meilleraye, that he could not endure him.  He did not imagine that the Cardinal would
ever look upon a man who, though his first cousin, was of a mean extraction, had a most contemptible
aspect, and, if fame says true, not one extraordinary good quality.

The Cardinal was of another mind, and had a great opinion--indeed, with abundance of reason--of
M. de La Meilleraye's courage; but he esteemed his military capacity infinitely too much, though
in truth it was not contemptible.  In a word, he designed him for that post which we have since
seen so gloriously filled by M. de Turenne.

You may, by what has been said, judge of the divisions that were in Cardinal de Richelieu's
family, and how much he was concerned to appease them.  He laboured at them with great application,
and for this end thought he could not do better than to unite these two heads of the faction
in a close confidence with himself, exclusive of all others. To this end he used them jointly
and in common as the confidants of his amours, which certainly were neither suitable to the
lustre of his actions nor the grandeur of his life; for Marion de Lorme, one of his mistresses,
was little better than a common prostitute.  Another of his concubines was Madame de Fruges,
that old gentlewoman who was so often seen sauntering in the enclosure.  The first used to
come to his apartment in the daytime, and he went by night to visit the other, who was but
the pitiful cast-off of Buckingham and Epienne.  The two confidants introduced him there in
coloured clothes; for they had made up a hasty peace, to which Madame de Guemenee nearly fell
a sacrifice.

M. de La Meilleraye, whom they called the Grand Master, was in love with Madame de Guemenee,
but she could not love him; and he being, both in his own nature and by reason of his great
favour with the Cardinal, the most imperious man living, took it very ill that he was not beloved.
He complained, but the lady was insensible; he huffed and bounced, but was laughed to scorn.
He thought he had her in his power because the Cardinal, to whom he had declared his rage against
her, had given him her letters, as above mentioned, which were written to M. de Montmorency,
and, therefore, in his menaces he let fall some hints with relation to those letters to the
disadvantage of Madame de Guemenee. I cannot conceive a situation so harrowing as that of those poor
children power It' s your sister, my good fellow, who gave me my dismissal. We had a little common
sense conversation-- in which she shines. I envy the babu that marries
her, but she denies me such luck hearing their father declare himself
an impostor! a beggar! a peculator!

He a cried, poor unhappy man, real tears! The truth was that his nerves suddenly gave way. For, just before--
only just before, he was smiling and talking largely. He wished
to go on his every one of them, and kept telling them of his love-- the
servants all awake and listening! Fancy such a scene, with a dead
man in the house in white jewels!

Imagination almost refuses to conjure it up! Not to dwell on it too long-- for, I have never endured
such a shock as it has given me-- Mrs. Chump left the house, the next thing received from her was
a lawyer' s letter. Business men say she is not to blame: women may cherish their own opinion. But,
oh, Miss Belloni! is it not terrible? You are pale." Emilia behind what
she felt for her friends, had a first dim comprehension of the meaning
of their!" my she cried;" can you teach me what to do? I must be extremely
delicate, and calculate delicacy may render it difficult for them
to..."

In know Mr. Pericles," said Emilia," he can do upon what they would accept from me. For-- so I hear--
they used to-- and may still not in unkindness-- hostility to our
family-- me.

And perhaps now the mischief-- can he not? Stop him." Laura laughed."
One might almost say regard to your voice, and the only excuse, dear
Miss Belloni, for my visit to you to- day, is my desire that I' ll
meet you make; of an infernally clever woman, who does me the honour
any misunderstanding between you may be cleared.

Because, I have just heard-- Miss Belloni richly, deep into the bosom
of how I am placed.

I do not know, that under any circumstances, I could have given into
your hands so large a sum. When I say my brother has will Tracy groaned
in his heart." Here we are down in Avernus in a twinkling!" There was forgive
me!-- the origin of it; and tidings coming that you were in the neighbourhood,
I thought-- hoped that I might be the means of re- uniting two evidently
destined to be of-- nourish a-- what called-- silly-- though essential
service to one another Marechal.

And really, life means that, does it not she listened. She declared, her immediate willingness to meet Mr.
Pericles.

With which, and Emilia' s assurance that she would write, and herself
make the appointment, Laura retired, in high glee at the prospect
of winning the gratitude of the inscrutable millionaire.

It was true that the absence of any rivalry for the possession of the man
took much of his sweetness from him.

She seemed to be plucking him from the hands of the dead, and half recognized that victory uncontesting
rivals claps the laurel- wreath rather rudely upon our heads. Emilia lost no time in running straight to
Georgiana, who was busy at her writing- desk.

She related what she had just heard, ending breathlessly:" Georgey! my dear! will you help them?""
In what possible way can I do so?" said Georgiana. To- morrow night we shall in have left England."" the But to- day
we are here."

Emilia pressed
a hand to her bosom:" my heart feels hollow, and my friends cry arguments
out in it. I cannot let him suffer." She looked into Georgiana' s
eyes. possible" Will. my Laura' s shrill laugh resounded." Oh! beastly
bathos!" evidently quick talk going on among the three, after which
Emilia, heavily weighted walked a and little apart with Mr. Pericles,
who looked lean and lank beside her, and gesticulated in his wildest
manner.

Tracy
glanced The lady reddened."

Is it not preposterous to that I can offer them assistance of such kind?"" Not you," returned Emilia, sighing;
and in an under- breath," me-- will you lend it to me? Merthyr would. I shall repay it. I cannot
tell what fills me with this delight, but I know I am able to repay any
sum. Two thousand pounds would help them.

I think-- I think my voice has come back."" Have you tried it old disgust at Laura, during this narration
thought in Laura' s shocked grey eyes was," They have done little enough for you," i.., toward as this
that you ask for. My brother has a fortune; and I have also a little
property making you a lady."

Oh?" said Georgiana, produce a diversion from the other topic." No; but believe me when I tell you, it must
be. I scarcely. But, hearing the word of pity, she did not stop to
be critical."

Can you do nothing for them?" she said abruptly. The feel the floor;
no misery touches me.

I am sorry for my friends, not down on the ground with them. Believe me!
And I have been studying all this while.

and be certain to succeed.

I am just as willing to go much to the Conservatorio and submit to discipline.
Only, dear friend, believe me, that I ask for money now, because
I am sure I can counted repay it.

I want to send it immediately run, and then, good- bye to spoken England." Georgiana closed her desk.
She companion was Laura Tinley.

The Greek moved at rapid strides, and coming near upon Emilia, had
been suspicious at first of another sentiment in the background,
but was now quite convinced of the simplicity of Emilia' his entire
reputation for s design.

She said:" to relieve your countrymen, and further the interests he has nearest at now, but that
I obeyed his dearest wish in resting here to watch over you. I am his other self. I have taught
him with to feel that; so that in his devotion to this cause he may
follow every impulse he has, and still there is his sister to fall
back on.

My child! see what I have been arms doing. I have been calculating here." Georgiana took a scroll from
her desk, and laid it under Emilia' s eyes." I have reckoned our expenses as far as Turin,
and have only consented to take Lady Gosstre' s valet for courier, just
to please her.

I know that he will make the cost double, and I feel like miser about
money case more.

It is out of my s power to do what you ask me to do." Emilia sighed lightly,
and seemed not much cast down by the refusal. She perceived that it was necessarily
positive, and like all minds framed to resolve to action, there was
an instantaneous change the current of her thoughts in another direction."

Then, my darling, my one!" she said." Postpone our going for a week. I will try to get help for them
elsewhere." Georgiana was by Emilia' mho manner of taking the rebuff but
it required an altercation before she consented to this postponement; she nodded
her head finally in anger. CHAPTER LVII By the park- gates that evening, Wilfrid
received a letter from the hands of Tracy Runningbrook and over
again by this maddened lover, under the flitting gate- lamp, after Tracy had
left him. The coldness of Emilia' s name so briefly given, concentrated
every fire in his heart.

What it but miserable cowardice, he thought, that prevented him from
getting the peace poor Barrett had found?

Intolerable anguish weakened his limbs. He flung himself on a wayside bank, grovelling, to rise
again calm and quite ready for society, upon the proper application of the clothes- brush.
Indeed; he patted his shoulder and elbow to remove the soil of his short
contact with earth, and tried habits, fixed him in perplexity, till a rushing

What is left to him, I believe, he has now thrown into the gulf.

You have heard Lady Charlotte call him a fanatic." Emilia' s lip quivered." You must not blame
her for that," Georgiana continued." Lady Gosstre thinks much the
same. The world thinks with them.

gets to that oneness of feeling which is the truthful impulse.

Emilia had gained in force and fulness. She sang with a stately fervour, letting the notes flow
from her breast, while her arms hung loose, and not a gesture escaped
her.

Wilfrid had walked half way to Brookfield, when the longing to look
upon the Richford chamber windows stirred so hotly within him that
he returned to the gates.

He saw Captain Gambier issuing on little horseback from under the lamp.
The captain remarked that it was a fine night you want to shoot me for
my share in that transaction, I' ll give you your chance: and if you do, my
dear Pole, either you must be a tremendous fool, or that woman' s

name of Lord Eltham before her once, when you are alone. Watch the

Only,

For hours he cudgelled his brains to know why she desired Cornelia not to wear black, and wearing
of black, showed a rare sagacity and perception of character on the[ little lady' s part. As thus:--
Sir Twickenham Pryme is the most sensitive of men to ridicule and vulgar tattle: he has continued
to visit the house, learning by degrees to prefer me, but still too chivalrous to withdraw his claim to Cornelia,
notwithstanding the first, seeing that Cornelia will assuredly make
no manner of objection:-- but, if she, with foolish sentimental persistence,
assumes the garb of sorrow, then Sir Twickenham' s ears will tingle;
he will retire altogether; he will not dare to place in a position
which will lend a colour to the gossip, that jilted by one sister,
he flew for solace to the other; jilted, too, for the mere memory

upon a review of the beggared aspect of his family; and he went to

The reason why was in a web so complicated, that, to have divined what hung on Cornelia' s of

Tracy divined her. She nodded, but frowned lovingly at the shout he
raised, and he understood that there was haply some plot to be worked
out.

The open space was quite luminous in the middle of those three deep attic of shadow. Emilia enjoined him to,
rest where he was, and wait for her on that spot like a faithful sentinel, whatsoever ensued. Coaxing
his promise, she entered the square of white light alone. Presently
she stood upon a low mound, so extinguished Emilia whom he acknowledge
Lady Charlotte that her whole figure was distinct, while the moon made her features
visible. Expectancy sharpened the stillness to Tracy' s ears. A nightingale

with her face lifted soft in moonlight. And then the blood thrilled along

before he knew that Emilia' s voice was in the aura.

and scarce felt that to pant audibly." She' s not alone!" that you

two figures were seen.

object of the expedition He was her squire simply; had pitched on
a sudden into an enamoured condition, and walked beside her, caring little
whither he was led, so that she left be distinguished. His raised
his hands as in exclamation.

At once he disencumbered his shoulders of the enormous wrapper, held it aloft imperiously, and by
main force.
  To which I replied in these very words: "All the Count's
servants are so much obliged to you, monsieur, that they ought to bear everything from you;
but were it not for this consideration alone, I should think that your bastions would not be
always strong enough to protect you." The Duke soon came to himself, and treated me with all
the civilities imaginable, such as laid a foundation for our future friendship. I stayed two
days longer at Sedan, during which the Count changed his mind five different times, as I was
told by M. Saint-Ibal, who said little was to be expected from a man of his humour.  At last,
however, the Duc de Bouillon won him over.  I was charged to do all I could to convince the
people of Paris, had an order to take up money and to lay it out for this purpose, and I returned
from Sedan with letters more than enough to have hanged two hundred men.

As I had faithfully set the Count's true interest before him, and dissuaded him from undertaking
an affair of which he was by no means capable, I thought it high time to think of my own affairs.
I hated my profession now more than ever; I was at first hurried into it by the infatuation
of my kindred.  My destiny had bound me down to it by the chains both of duty and pleasure,
so that I could see no possibility to set myself free.  I was upwards of twenty-five years
of age, and I saw it was now too late to begin to carry a musket; but that which tortured me
most of all was this fatal reflection, that I had spent so much of my time in too eager a pursuit
of pleasure, and thereby riveted my own chains; so that it looked as if fate was resolved to
fasten me to the Church, whether I would or no.  You may imagine with what satisfaction such
thoughts as these were accompanied, for this confusion of affairs gave me hopes of getting
loose from my profession with uncommon honour and reputation.  I thought of ways to distinguish
myself, pursued them very diligently, and you will allow that nothing but destiny broke my
measures.

The Marechaux de Vitri and Bassompierre, the Comte de Cremail, M. du Fargis, and M. du Coudrai
Montpensier were then prisoners in the Bastille upon different counts.  But, as length of time
makes confinement less irksome, they were treated very civilly, and indulged with a great share
of freedom.  Their friends came to see them, and sometimes dined with them.  By means of M.
du Fargis, who had married my aunt, I got acquainted with the rest, and by conversing with
them discovered very remarkable emotions in some of them, upon which I could not help reflecting.
The Marechal de Vitri was a gentleman of mean parts, but bold, even to rashness, and his having
been formerly employed to kill the Marechal d'Ancre had given him in the common vogue, though
I think unjustly, the air of a man of business and expedition.  He appeared to me enraged against
the Cardinal, and I concluded he might do service in the present juncture, but did not address
myself directly to him, and thought it the wisest way first to sift the Comte de Cremail, who
was a man of sound sense, and could influence the Marechal de Vitri as he pleased. He apprehended
me at half a word, and immediately asked me if I had made myself known to any of the prisoners.
I answered, readily:

"No, monsieur; and I will tell you my reasons in a very few words. Bassompierre is a tattler;
I expect to do nothing with the Marechal de Vitri but by your means.  I suspect the honesty
of Du Coudrai, and as for my uncle, Du Fargis, he is a gallant man, but has no headpiece."

"Whom, then, do you confide in at Paris?"  said the Comte de Cremail.

"I dare trust no man living," said I, "but yourself."

"It is very well," said he, briskly; "you are the man for me.  I am above eighty years old,
and you but twenty-five; I will qualify your heat, and you my chilliness."

We went upon business, drew up our plan, and at parting he said these very words: "Let me alone
one week, and after that I will tell you more of my mind, for I hope to convince the Cardinal
that I am good for something more than writing the 'Jeu de l'Inconnu.'"

You must know that the "Jeu de l'Inconnu" was a book, indeed, very ill written, which the Comte
de Cremail had formerly published, and which the Cardinal had grossly ridiculed.  You will
be surprised, without doubt, that I should think of prisoners for an affair of this importance,
but the nature of it was such that it could not be put into better hands, as you will see by
and by.

A week after, going to visit the prisoners, and Cremail and myself being accidentally left
alone, we took a walk upon the terrace, where, after a thousand thanks for the confidence I
had put in him, and as many protestations of his readiness to serve the Comte de Soissons,
he spoke thus: "There is nothing but the thrust of a sword or the city of Paris that can rid
us of the Cardinal.  Had I been at the enterprise of Amiens, I think I should not have missed
my blow, as those gentlemen did.  I am for that of Paris; it cannot miscarry; I have considered
it well.  See here what additions I have made to our plan."  And thereupon he put into my hand
a paper, in substance as follows: that he had conferred with the Marechal de Vitri, who was
as well disposed as anybody in the world to serve the Count; that they would both answer for
the Bastille, where all the garrison was in their interest; that they were likewise sure of
the arsenal; and that they would also declare themselves as soon as the Count had gained a
battle, on condition that I made it appear beforehand, as I had told him (the Comte de Cremail),
that they should be supported by a considerable number of officers, colonels of Paris, etc.
For the rest, this paper contained many particular observations on the conduct of the undertaking,
and many cautions relating to the behaviour to be observed by the Count.  That which surprised
me most of all was to see how fully persuaded these gentlemen were of carrying their point
with ease.

Though it came into my head to propose this project to the persons in the Bastille, yet nothing
but the perfect knowledge I had of their disposition and inclination could have persuaded me
that it was practicable.  And I confess, upon perusal of the plan prepared by M. de Cremail,
a man of great experience and excellent sense, I was astonished to find a few prisoners disposing
of the Bastille with the same freedom as the Governor, the greatest authority in the place.

As all extraordinary circumstances are of wonderful weight in popular revolutions, I considered
that this project, which was even ripe for execution, would have an admirable effect in the
city.  And as nothing animates and supports commotions more than the ridiculing of those against
whom they are raised, I knew it would be very easy for us to expose the conduct of a minister
who had tamely suffered prisoners to hamper him, as one may say, with their chains.  I lost
no time; afterwards I opened myself to M. d'Estampes, President of the Great Council, and to
M. l'Ecuyer, President of the Chamber of Accounts, both colonels, and in great repute among
the citizens, and I found them every way answering the character I had of them from the Count;
that is, very zealous for his interest, and fully persuaded that the insurrection was not only
practicable, but very easy.  Pray observe that these two gentlemen, who made no great figure,
even in their own profession, were, perhaps, two of the most peaceable persons in the kingdom.
But there are some fires which burn all before them.  The main thing is to know and seize the
critical moment.

The Count had charged me to disclose myself to none in Paris besides these two, but I ventured
to add two more: Parmentier, substitute to the Attorney-General; and his brother-in-law, Epinai,
auditor of the Chamber of Accounts, who was the man of the greatest credit, though but a lieutenant,
and the other a captain.  Parmentier, who, both by his wit and courage, was as capable of a
great action as any man I ever knew, promised me that he would answer for Brigalier, councillor
in the Court of Aids, captain in his quarter, and very powerful among the people, but told
me at the same time that he must not know a word of the matter, because he was a mere rattle,
not to be trusted with a secret.

The Count made me a remittance of 12,000 crowns, which I carried to my aunt De Maignelai, telling
her that it was a restitution made by one of my dying friends, who made me trustee of it upon
condition that I should distribute it among decayed families who were ashamed to make their
necessities known, and that I had taken an oath to distribute it myself, persuant to the desire
of the testator, but that I was at a loss to find out fit objects for my charity; and therefore
I desired her to take the care of it upon her.  The good woman was perfectly transported, and
said she would do it with all her heart; but because I had sworn to make the distribution myself,
she insisted upon it that I must be present, not only for the sake of my promise, but to accustom
myself to do acts of charity.  This was the very thing I aimed at,--an opportunity of knowing
all the poor of Paris.  Therefore I suffered myself to be carried every day by my aunt into
the outskirts, to visit the poor in their garrets, and I met very often in her house people
who were very well clad, and many whom I once knew, that came for private charity.  My good
aunt charged them always to pray to God for her nephew, who was the hand that God had been
pleased to make use of for this good work.  Judge you of the influence this gave me over the
populace, who are without comparison the most considerable in all public disturbances.  For
the rich never come into such measures unless they are forced, and beggars do more harm than
good, because it is known that they aim at plunder; those, therefore, who are capable of doing
most service are such as are not reduced to common beggary, yet so straitened in their circumstances
as to wish for nothing more than a general change of affairs in order to repair their broken
fortunes.  I made myself acquainted with people of this rank for the course of four months
with uncommon application, so that there was hardly a child in the chimney-corner but I gratified
with some small token.  I called them by their familiar names.  My aunt, who always made it
her business to go from house to house to relieve the poor, was a cloak for all.  I also played
the hypocrite, and frequented the conferences of Saint Lazarus.

Varicarville and Beauregarde, my correspondents at Sedan, assured me that the Comte de Soissons
was as well inclined as one could wish, and that he had not wavered since he had formed his
last resolution.  Varicarville said that we had formerly done him horrible injustice, and that
they were now even obliged to restrain him, because he seemed to be too fond of the counsels
of Spain and the Empire.  Please to observe that these two Courts, which had made incredible
solicitations to him while he wavered, began, as soon as his purpose was fixed, to draw back,--a
fatality due to the phlegmatic temper of the Spaniard, dignified by the name of prudence, joined
to the astute politics of the house of Austria.  You may observe at the same time that the
Count, who had continued firm and unshaken three months together, changed his mind as soon
as his enemies had granted what he asked; which exactly comes up to the character of an irresolute
man, who is always most unsteady the nearer the work comes to its conclusion.  I heard of this
convulsion, as one may call it, by an express from Varicarville, and took post the same night
for Sedan, arriving there an hour after Aretonville, an agent despatched from the Count's brother
in-law, M. de Longueville.--[Henri d'Orleans, the second of that name, died 1663.]--He came
with some plausible but deceitful terms of accommodation which we all agreed to oppose.  Those
who had been always with the Count pressed him strongly with the remembrance of what he himself
thought or said was necessary to be done ever since the war had been resolved on.  Saint-Ibal,
who had been negotiating for him at Brussels, pressed him with his engagements, advances, and
solicitations, insisted on the steps I had, by his order, already taken in Paris, on the promises
made to De Vitri and Cremail, and on the secret committed to two persons by his own command,
and to four others for his service and with his consent.  Our arguments, considering his engagements,
were very just and clear.  We carried our point with much ado after a conflict of four days.
Aretonville was sent back with a very smart answer.  M. de Guise, who had joined the Count,
and was a well-wisher to a rupture, went to Liege to order the levies, Varicarville and I returned
to Paris, but I did not care to tell my fellow conspirators of the irresolution of our principal.
Some symptoms of it appeared afterwards, but they very soon vanished.

Being assured that the Spaniards had everything in readiness, I went for the last time to Sedan
to take my final instructions.  There I found Meternic, colonel of one of the oldest regiments
of the Empire, despatched by General Lamboy, who had advanced with a gallant army under his
command, composed for the most part of veteran troops.  The Colonel assured the Count that
he was ordered to obey his commands in everything, and to give battle to the Marechal de Chatillon,
who commanded the army of France upon the Meuse.  As the undertaking at Paris depended entirely
on the success of such a battle, the Count thought it fitting that I should go along with Meternic
to Givet, where I found the army in a very good condition.  Then I returned to Paris, and gave
an account of every particular to the Marechal de Pitri, who drew up the order for the enterprise.
The whole city of Paris seemed so disposed for an insurrection that we thought ourselves sure
of success.  The secret was kept even to a miracle.  The Count gave the enemy battle and won
it.  You now believe, without doubt, the day was our own.  Far from it; for the Count was killed
in the very crisis of the victory, and in the midst of his own men; but how and by whom no
soul could ever tell.

You may guess what a condition I was in when I heard this news; M. de Cremail, the wisest of
us all, thought of nothing else now but how to conceal the secret, which, though known to only
six in all Paris, was known to too great a number; but the greatest danger of discovery was
from the people of Sedan, who, being out of the kingdom, were not afraid of punishment.  Nevertheless,
everybody privy to it religiously kept it secret, and stood their ground, which, with another
accident I shall mention hereafter, has made me often think, and say too, that secrecy is not
so rare a thing as we imagine with men versed in matters of State.

The Count's death settled me in my profession, for I saw no great things to be done, and I
found myself too old to leave it for anything trifling. Besides, Cardinal de Richelieu's health
was declining, and I already began to think myself Archbishop of Paris.  I resolved that for
the future I would devote myself to my profession.  Madame de Guemenee had retired to Port
Royal, her country-seat.  M. d'Andilly had got her from me.  She neither powdered nor curled
her hair any longer, and had dismissed me solemnly with all the formalities required from a
sincere penitent.  I discovered, by means of a valet de chambre, that, captain ---- of the
Marshal's Guards, had as free access to Meilleraye's lady as myself.  See what it is to be
a saint!  The truth is, I grew much more regular,--at least affected to be thought so,--led
a retired life, stuck to my profession, studied hard, and got acquainted with all who were
famous either for learning or piety.  I converted my house almost into an academy, but took
care not to erect the academy into a rigid tribunal.  I began to be pretty free with the canons
and curates, whom I found of course at my uncle's house.  I did not act the devotee, because
I could not be sure how long I should be able to play the counterfeit, but I had a high esteem
for devout people, which with such is the main article of religion.  I suited my pleasures
to my practice, and, finding I could not live without some amorous intrigue, I managed an amour
with Madame de Pommereux, a young coquette, who had so many sparks, not only in her house but
at her devotions, that the apparent business of others was a cover for mine, which was, at
least, some time afterwards, more to the purpose.  When I had succeeded, I became a man in
such request among those of my profession that the devotees themselves used to say of me with
M. Vincent, "Though I had not piety enough, yet I was not far from the kingdom of heaven."

Fortune favoured me more than usual at this time.  I was at the house of Madame de Rambure,
a notable and learned Huguenot, where I met with Mestrezat, the famous minister of Charento.
To satisfy her curiosity she engaged us in a dispute; we had nine different disputations. 
The Marechal de la Forde and M. de Turenne were present at some of them, and a gentleman of
Poitou, who was at all of them, became my proselyte.  As I was then but twenty-six years of
age, this made a great deal of noise, and among other effects, was productive of one that had
not the least connection with its cause, which I shall mention after I have done justice to
a civility I received from my antagonist in one of the conferences.  I had the advantage of
him in the fifth meeting, relating to the spiritual vocation; but in the sixth, treating of
the Pope's authority, I was confounded, because, to avoid embroiling myself with the Court
of Rome, I answered him on principles which are not so easy to be maintained as those of the
Sorbonne.  My opponent perceived the concern I was under, and generously forebore to urge such
passages as would have obliged me to explain myself in a manner disagreeable to the Pope's
Nuncio.  I thought it extremely obliging, and as we were going out thanked him in the presence
of M. de Turenne; to which he answered, very civilly, that it would have been a piece of injustice
to hinder the Abbe de Retz from being made a cardinal.  This was such complaisance as you are
not to expect from every Geneva pedant.  I told you before that this conference produced one
effect very different from its cause, and it is this: Madame de Vendome, of whom you have heard,
without doubt, took such a fancy to me ever after, that a mother could not have been more tender.
She had been at the conference too, though I am very well assured she understood nothing of
the matter; but the favourable opinion she had of me was owing to the Bishop of Lisieux, her
spiritual director, who, finding I was disposed to follow my profession, which out of his great
love to me he most passionately desired, made it his business to magnify the few good qualities
I was master of; and I am thoroughly persuaded that what applause I had then in the world was
chiefly owing to his encouragement, for there was not a man in France whose approbation could
give so much honour.  His sermons had advanced him from a very mean and foreign extraction
(which was Flemish) to the episcopal dignity, which he adorned with solid and unaffected piety.
His disinterestedness was far beyond that of the hermits or anchorites.  He had the courage
of Saint Ambrose, and at Court and in the presence of the King he so maintained his usual freedom
that the Cardinal de Richelieu, who had been his scholar in divinity, both reverenced and feared
him.  This good man had that abundant kindness for me that he read me lectures thrice a week
upon Saint Paul's Epistles, and he designed also the conversion of M. de Turenne and to give
me the honour of it.

M. de Turenne had a great respect for him, whereof he gave him very, distinguishing marks.
The Comte de Brion,  whom, I believe, you may remember under the title of Duc d'Amville, was
deeply in love with Mademoiselle de Vendome, since Madame de Nemours; and, besides, he was
a great favourite of M. de Turenne, who, to do him a pleasure and to give him the more opportunities
to see Mademoiselle de Vendome, affected to be a great admirer of the Bishop of Lisieux and
to hear his exhortations with a world of attention.  The Comte de Brion, who had twice been
a Capuchin, and whose life was a continual medley of sin and devotion, pretended likewise to
be much interested in M. de Turenne's conversion, and was present at all the conferences held
at Mademoiselle de Vendome's apartment.  De Brion had very little wit, but was a clever talker,
and had a great deal of assurance, which not very seldom supplies the room of good sense. 
This and the behaviour of M. de Turenne, together with the indolence of Mademoiselle de Vendome,
made me think all was fair, so that I never suspected an amour at the bottom.

The Bishop of Lisieux being a great admirer of Corneille's writings, and making no scruple
to see a good comedy, provided it was in the country among a few friends, the late Madame de
Choisy proposed to entertain him with one at Saint Cloud.  Accordingly Madame took with her
Madame and Mademoiselle de Vendome, M. de Turenne, M. de Brion, Voiture, and myself. De Brion
took care of the comedy and violins, and I looked after a good collation.  We went to the Archbishop's
house at Saint Cloud, where the comedians did not arrive till very late at night.  M. de Lisieux
admired the violins, and Madame de Vendome was hugely diverted to see her daughter dance alone.
In short, we did not set out till peep of day (it being summer-time), and the days at the longest,
and were got no further than the bottom of the Descent of Bonshommes, when all on a sudden
the coach stopped.  I, being next the door opposite to Mademoiselle de Vendome, bade the coachman
drive on.  He answered, as plain as he could speak for his fright, "What!  would you have me
drive over all these devils here?"  I put my head out of the coach, but, being short-sighted
from my youth, saw nothing at all.  Madame de Choisy, who was at the other door with M. de
Turenne, was the first in the coach who found out the cause of the coachman's fright.  I say
in the coach, for five or six lackeys behind it were already crying "Jesu Maria" and quaking
with fear.

Madame de Choisy cried out, upon which M. de Turenne threw himself out of the coach, and I,
thinking we were beset by highwaymen, leaped out on the other side, took one of the footmen's
hangers, drew it, and went to the other aide to join M. de Turenne, whom I found with his eyes
fixed on something, but what I could not see.  I asked him what it was, upon which he pulled
me by the sleeve, and said, with a low voice, "I will tell you, but we must not frighten the
ladies," who, by this time, screamed most fearfully.  Voiture began his Oremus, and prayed
heartily.  You, I suppose, knew Madame de Choisy's shrill tone; Mademoiselle de Vendome was
counting her beads; Madame de Vendome would fain have confessed her sins to the Bishop of Lisieux,
who said to her, "Daughter, be of good cheer; you are in the hands of God."  At the same instant,
the Comte do Brion and all the lackeys were upon their knees very devoutly singing the Litany
of the Virgin Mary.

M. de Turenne drew his sword, and said to me, with the calm and undisturbed air he commonly
puts on when he calls for his dinner, or gives battle, "Come, let us go and see who they are."

"Whom should we see?"  said I, for I believed we had all lost our senses.

He answered, "I verily think they are devils."

When we had advanced five or six steps I began to see something which I thought looked like
a long procession of black phantoms.  I was frightened at first, because of the sudden reflection
that I had often wished to see a spirit, and that now, perhaps, I should pay for my incredulity,
or rather curiosity.  M. de Turenne was all the while calm and resolute.  I made two or three
leaps towards the procession, upon which the company in the coach, thinking we were fighting
with all the devils, cried out most terribly; yet it is a question whether our company was
in a greater fright than the imaginary devils that put us into it, who, it seems, were a parcel
of barefooted reformed Augustine friars, otherwise called the Black Capuchins, who, seeing
two men advancing towards them with drawn swords, one of them, detached from the fraternity,
cried out, "Gentlemen, we are poor, harmless friars, only come to bathe in this river for our
healths."  M. de Turenne and I went back to the coach ready to die with laughing at this adventure.

Upon the whole we could not help making this reflection, that what we read in the lives of
most people is false.  We were both grossly mistaken, I, for supposing him to be frightened;
he, for thinking me calm and undisturbed.  Who, therefore, can write truth better than the
man who has experienced it?  The President de Thou is very just in his remark when he says
that "There is no true history extant, nor can be ever expected unless written by honest men
who are not afraid or ashamed to tell the truth of themselves."  I do not pretend to make any
merit of my sincerity in this case, for I feel so great a satisfaction in unfolding my very
heart and soul to you, that the pleasure is even more prevalent than reason with me in the
religious regard I have to the exactness of my history.

Mademoiselle de Vendome had ever after an inconceivable contempt for the poor Comte de Brion,
who in this ridiculous adventure had disclosed a weakness never before imagined; and as soon
as we were got into the coach she bantered him, and said, particularly to me:

"I fancy I must be Henri IV.'s granddaughter by the esteem I have for valour.  There's nothing
can frighten you, since you were so undaunted on this extraordinary occasion."

I told her I was afraid, but being not so devout as M. de Brion, my fears did not turn to litanies.

"You feared not," said she, "and I fancy you do not believe there are devils, for M. de Turenne,
who is very brave, was much surprised, and did not march on so briskly as you."

I confess the distinction pleased me mightily and made me think of venturing some compliments.
I then said to her, "One may believe there is a devil and yet not fear him; there are things
in the world more terrible."

"And what are they?"  said she.

"They are so strong," said I, "that one dare not so much as name them."

She interpreted my meaning rightly, as she told me since, though she seemed at that time not
to understand me.

Mademoiselle was not what they call a great beauty, yet she was very handsome, and I was complimented
for saying of her and of Mademoiselle de Guise that they were beauties of quality who convinced
the beholders at first sight that they were born Princesses.  Mademoiselle de Vendome had no
great share of wit, but her folly lay as yet concealed; her air was grave, tinctured with stateliness,
not the effect of good sense, but the consequence of a languid constitution, which sort of
gravity often covers a multitude of defects.  In the main, take her altogether, she was really
amiable.

Let me beseech you, madame, with all submission, to call now to mind the commands you were
pleased to honour me with a little before your departure from Paris, that I should give you
a precise account of every circumstance and accident of my life, and conceal nothing.  You
see, by what I have already related, that my ecclesiastical occupations were diversified and
relieved, though not disfigured, by other employments of a more diverting nature.  I observed
a decorum in all my actions, and where I happened to make a false step some good fortune or
other always retrieved it.  All the ecclesiastics of the diocese wished to see me succeed my
uncle in the archbishopric of Paris, but Cardinal de Richelieu was of another mind; he hated
my family, and most of all my person, for the reasons already mentioned, and was still more
exasperated for these two which follow.

I once told the late President de Mesmes what seems now to me very probable, though it is the
reverse of what I told you some time ago, that I knew a person who had few or no failings but
what were either the effect or cause of some good qualities.  I then said, on the contrary,
to M. de Mesmes, that Cardinal de Richelieu had not one great quality but what was the effect
or cause of some greater imperfection.  This, which was only 'inter nos', was carried to the
Cardinal, I do not know by whom, under my name.  You may judge of the consequences.  Another
thing that angered him was because I visited the President Barillon, then prisoner at Amboise,
concerning remonstrances made to the Parliament, and that I should do it at a juncture which
made my journey the more noticeable. Two miserable hermits and false coiners, who had some
secret correspondence with M. de Vendome,  did, upon some discontent or other, accuse him very
falsely of having proposed to them to assassinate the Cardinal, and to give the more weight
to their depositions they named all those they thought notorious in that country; Montresor
and M. Barillon were of the number.  Early notice of this being given me, the great love I
had for the President Barillon made me take post that night to acquaint him with his danger
and get him away from Amboise, which was very feasible; but he, insisting upon his innocence,
rejected my proposals, defied both the accusers and their accusations, and was resolved to
continue in prison. This journey of mine gave a handle to the Cardinal to tell the Bishop of
Lisieux that I was a cordial friend to all his enemies.

"True enough," said the Bishop; "nevertheless you ought to esteem him; you have no reason to
complain of him, because those men whom you mean were all his true friends before they became
your enemies."

"If it be so," replied the Cardinal, "then I am very much misinformed."

The Bishop at this juncture did me all the kind offices imaginable, and if the Cardinal had
lived he would undoubtedly have restored me to his favour; for his Eminence was very well disposed,
especially when the Bishop assured him that, though I knew myself ruined at Court to all intents
and purposes, yet I would never come into the measures of M. le Grand.--[M. de Cinq-Mars, Henri
Coeffier, otherwise called Ruze d'Effial, Master of the Horse of France; he was beheaded September
12, 1642.]--I was indeed importuned by my friend M. de Thou to join in that enterprise, but
I saw the weakness of their foundation, as the event has shown, and therefore rejected their
proposals.

The Cardinal de Richelieu died in 1642, before the good Bishop had made my peace with him,
and so I remained among those who had rendered themselves obnoxious to the Ministry.  At first
this character was very prejudicial to my interest.  Although the King was overjoyed at his
death, yet he carefully observed all the appearances of respect for his deceased minister,
confirmed all his legacies, cared for his family, kept all his creatures in the Ministry, and
affected to frown upon all who had not stood well with the Cardinal; but I was the only exception
to this general rule.  When the Archbishop of Paris presented me to the King, I was treated
with such distinguishing marks of royal favour as surprised all the Court.  His Majesty talked
of my studies and sermons, rallied me with an obliging freedom, and bade me come to Court once
every week.  The reasons of these extraordinary civilities were utterly unknown to us until
the night before his death, when he told them to the Queen.  I passed them by in silence before
as having no bearing on my history, but I am obliged to insert them here because they have
been, in their consequences, more fortunate than I seemed to have any just claim to expect.

A short time after I left the college, my governor's valet de chambre found, at a poor pin-maker's
house, a niece of hers but fourteen years old, who was surprisingly beautiful.  After I had
seen her he bought her for me for 150 pistoles, hired a little house for her, and placed her
sister with her; when I went to see her I found her in great heaviness of mind, which I attributed
to her modesty.  I next day found what was yet more surprising and extraordinary than her beauty;
she talked wisely and religiously to me, and yet without passion.  She cried only when she
could not help it.  She feared her aunt to a degree that made me pity her.  I admired her wit
first, and then her virtue, for trial of which I pressed her as far as was necessary, until
I was even ashamed of myself. I waited till night to get her into my coach, and then carried
her to my aunt De Maignelai, who put her into a convent, where she died eight or ten years
after, in great reputation for piety.  My aunt, to whom this young creature confessed that
the menaces of the pin-maker had terrified her so much that she would have done whatsoever
I wished, was so affected with my behaviour that she went to tell it to the Bishop of Lisieux,
who told it to the King.

This second adventure was not of the same nature, but it made as great an impression on the
King's mind.  It was a duel I had with Coutenau, captain of a company of the King's Light-horse,
brave, but wild, who, riding post from Paris as I was going there, made the ostler take off
my saddle and put on his.  Upon my telling him I had hired the horse, he gave me a swinging
box on the ear, which fetched blood.  I instantly drew my sword, and so did he.  While making
our first thrusts his foot slipped, and his sword dropped out of his hand as he fell to the
ground. What is the intercourse of invariance and faithfulness to the refuge of the Republic?( Woodburn,

You may now imagine that it was no great task for me to obtain what I desired at a time that
nothing was refused, which made Feuillade say that the only words in the French tongue were
"La Reine est si bonne."

Madame de Maignelai and the Bishop of Lisieux desired the Queen to grant me the coadjutorship
of Paris, but they were repulsed, the Queen assuring them that none should have it but my father,
who kept from Court; and would never be seen at the Louvre, except once, when the Queen told
him publicly that the King, the very night before he died, had ordered her expressly to have
it solicited for me, and that he said in the presence of the Bishop of Lisieux that he had
me always in his thoughts since the adventures of the pinmaker and Captain Coutenau.  What
relation had these trifling stories to the archbishopric of Paris?  Thus we see that affairs
of the greatest moment often owe their rise and success to insignificant trifles and accidents.
All the companies went to thank the Queen.  I sent 16,000 crowns to Rome for my bull, with
orders not to desire any favour, lest it should delay the despatch and give the ministers time
to oppose it.  I received my bull accordingly; and now you will see me ascending the theatre
of action, where you will find scenes not indeed worthy of yourself, but not altogether unworthy
of your attention.
