RUTH ARNOLD;

Or, The Country Cousin.

CHAPTER I.

A LETTER.

School was over, and the holidays were beginning once more, summer holidays, with all their
promise of pleasure for dwellers in the country. The scent of sweet new hay was borne on the
afternoon breeze, and the broad sunlight lay on fields of waving corn which would soon be ready
for the sickle, and on green meadows from which the hay was being carried.

Ruth Arnold slowly wended her way home-wards along the hot dusty road, turned down a shady
green lane, opened a little gate and walked up the garden path; and then, instead of running
indoors as usual, she sat down in the little rose-covered porch and looked rather thoughtfully
at the book in her hand.

It was a new book, a prize which had been awarded her that afternoon; but she felt very little
pride in it, for she had known all through the half-year that the prize would be hers unless
she was very idle or lazy. Nor did she anticipate much pleasure in reading it, for it was only
a new English grammar, and grammar was not a study in which she felt particularly interested
at that moment.

It was not often that Ruth sat down to think, for she was a merry lively girl; but this afternoon
she felt rather discontented with her lot. The truth was that she had been at Miss Green's
school, the only one in the village, ever since she was six years old; and now she had turned
fourteen, and began to feel some contempt for the elementary catechisms which had been her
only lesson-books, and which were certainly not calculated to make learning attractive or interesting.
The mode of instruction at Miss Green's was the old-fashioned one of saying lessons by rote
from the said catechisms, and when the pupils had reached the end of the book they had to begin
again at the first chapter.

"I'm sure I don't know what I've learnt this half-year," said Ruth to herself. "I can't remember
learning a single thing which I didn't know six months ago; and yet mother says that I must
not leave school until I am fifteen. I wonder what books they use in large boarding-schools,
and if they ever get beyond Mangnall's Questions in the first class. I suppose I shouldn't
trouble about it if it were not for father's teaching us in the winter evenings; but he knows
so much, that we see how ignorant we are."

"I didn't know that you were at home, Ruth. How long have you been here?" asked her mother's voice.

"Only a few minutes."

"Where is your prize? And why did you not show it to me?"

"Here it is, mother; but I don't much care for it. There is so little credit in getting a prize
at Miss Green's, where one makes so little progress, and has to do the same thing over and
over again."

"Yes," said Mrs. Arnold with a little sigh, "and so you will find it in life, dear, the same
thing over and over again, every day and every year. But now," she added smiling, "as everyone
is busy in the hay-field, and baby has to be nursed and the cows to be milked every day, will
you help me to do one thing or the other?"

"Yes," said Ruth as she went to put on a large blue pinafore; "I'll go and help Mary with the
milking."

Five minutes later she was seated on a low stool beside her favourite cow, Beauty, which had
been reared on the farm, and named by Ruth herself, who petted and talked to her like an old
friend. The afternoon was very warm, but still and sweet and quiet, with the summer hush upon
everything, even the lowing of the cows in the farm-yard, the murmur of the brook, and the
voices of the workers in the distant hay-field.

"Ah me, old Beauty!" sighed Ruth, as she pressed the milk into the pail, "mother says that
it is the same thing over and over again all our lives, and I suppose it is true, but I wish
I could have something different."

Beauty only lowed; but if she could have spoken English she might have said, "If you find life
monotonous, what must it be for me? In the morning I rise and crop the grass, then I come in
to be milked. I go back to the meadow and bathe in the stream or eat as much grass as I want;
in the afternoon I lie under the shade of the trees and chew the cud; and in the evening I
come again to be milked, and once more return to the meadows. If I have a calf of my own, it
is taken from me and sent--I know not where. Yes, it is the same thing over and over again.
Yet I am quite content."

Whatever Beauty meant as she lowed and looked at Ruth with her great patient eyes, the young
girl did not understand, but went on thinking aloud: "Yes, it is breakfast, dinner, tea and
supper every day, and mother has to see to it all; and the children to be washed and dressed
and nursed, and the cows to be milked, and the cream to be skimmed; and then every year father
has the ploughing, and sowing, and haying, and the har----"

"Ah, Ruth, I see you are making yourself useful," cried her father, as he entered the farm-yard
followed by two merry looking boys aged respectively seventeen and twelve. It was evident from
a single glance that they were Ruth's brothers, although their hands and faces were brown and
sunburnt, and Will, the elder, was fully a head taller than his sister.

"Guess what Will has got for you, Ruth!" cried roguish little Ned.

"Oh, Will!" she exclaimed, looking up brightly, all her grave thoughts gone in a moment, "have
you brought a new plant for my garden? No! Has Annie Price sent the pattern she promised for
my wool-work? Well then, is it the new tune-book you were talking of yesterday, with both the
music and words?"

"No, you are quite wrong; and as I can't tell whether it is anything good or bad, I may as
well give it to you at once. It's from a girl, I think," continued Will, as he took a letter
from his pocket.

"A letter for me! Who can it be from? Yes, I see it comes from a girl by the writing. What
a pretty hand! ever so much better than mine; and here is the post-mark--Busyborough; it must
be from Cousin Julia," she said as she turned the letter over.

Then she opened it and began to read, while her brothers stood by full of interest, and saw
a look of mingled wonder, surprise, and delight spread over her face. They waited as long as
their curiosity would permit, and then both cried eagerly, "What does she say? What is it all
about?"

"She wants me--that is, aunt has invited me--to spend my holidays with them at the sea-side,"
said Ruth, speaking very slowly, and looking as if she could hardly understand the idea of
such a piece of good fortune coming in her way. "But there," she added with a sigh, as she
refolded the letter and put it into her pocket and tried to banish the visions of brightness
it had called forth, "of course it is quite out of the question. I couldn't go away now when
every one is so busy."

She walked slowly back to the house, and tried not to think of the bright dream of pleasure
the letter had suggested; but this was not an easy matter, as her father and mother were already
sitting at the tea-table talking over the same subject, for Mrs. Arnold had also received a
letter from Busyborough that afternoon.

CHAPTER II.

TALKING IT OVER.

"Have you read your cousin's letter, Ruth?" asked her mother as she took her seat. "Why, what
makes you look so unhappy?" she exclaimed, observing the girl's grave face.

"It's very silly, I know, mother; and I didn't mean to be vexed about it," she began, "but
Julia said something about my going to the sea-side with them to spend the holidays. Of course
I know very well that you couldn't spare me,--but I can't help crying--just a minute, mother,
that is all," said Ruth, while her tears dropped slowly.

"Don't cry, child; we'll talk it over to-night, and see what can be done," said her father
cheerfully.

"But, father!" cried Ruth, starting up in surprise, her tears quite forgotten, "you don't think
really that there is any chance of my going, do you? Just see how busy you are with the haying,
and then there are the boys and the little ones----"

"Well, well, your mother and I will talk it over," he repeated, as he took up his hat and set
out again for the hay-field.

The summer evening soon slipped away, and Ruth knew better than to worry her mother by asking
foolish questions; but when supper was over, and her head lay at rest upon the pillow, her
brain was busy, and it was a long time before sleep overtook her. Delightful visions of sea-side
places such as she had read of in her favourite books, of picnics and boating, of rambles in
search of shells, rare stones and long sea-weeds, filled her mind; and as she heard the monotonous
sounds of her parents' voices talking in low tones in the room beneath her, and knew that they
were discussing the important question Was she to go or stay? her impatience almost got the
better of her, and she longed to run downstairs and take part in the conversation.

Presently the voices ceased, there were footsteps on the stairs, the light of a candle showed
through the chink of her door, the footsteps receded and a door was shut, and Ruth knew that
the decision was made and her mother had gone to bed. And as she could not know the result
of the conversation that night, she very wisely closed her eyes and went to sleep.

Early the next morning she was awakened by the sun shining in at her window. She rose at once,
dressed quickly, and was soon downstairs, but not before her mother, who was busily preparing
the breakfast. There was so much to be done before the meal was ready, so much chatter over
it, and so many last words to the boys and their father before they set out for the hay-field,
that Ruth could not find an opportunity to ask her mother the question that was burning upon
her lips, until all trace of the meal was removed and the children had gone to play in the orchard.

Then she went upstairs to help her make the beds, and there was time for a quiet chat.

Mrs. Arnold began by inquiring, "What did your cousin say in her letter yesterday?"

"She asked if I could spend my holidays with them at the sea-side," replied Ruth, blushing
with joy at the very thought.

"And you would like to go?"

"Oh yes, indeed I should, very, very much; that is--of course--if you could spare me," she
added hesitatingly.

"I suppose then that you do not know what your aunt has suggested. She writes to know if we
will spare you, not only for the holidays, but for a whole twelvemonth, to be a companion to
your cousin and go to school with her (What are you doing with the pillows, Ruth?), to share
her studies and amusements."

"Should I see none of you for a whole year?"

"I am not sure; that would depend upon your aunt."

"But--mother--you don't think of letting me go, do you?" asked Ruth, almost over-whelmed with
pleasure and surprise.

"I don't know. Your father thinks it would be good for you, but I am not sure, Ruth. I am afraid
whether, after living in a handsome well-appointed house, waited upon by servants, and surrounded
with comforts and luxuries, you would grow discontented with our quiet country life. I know
you love your home now, but I fear lest a life in town should spoil you, and make you no longer
our little Ruth, but a grown-up young lady, who would feel herself above our simple joys and
pleasures, and only bring herself to tolerate them from a sense of duty."

"Mother, mother!" cried Ruth, bursting into tears, "don't talk so. I'll never go away. How
can you think so of me?"

"Perhaps I have done wrong to say so much to you, darling," replied her mother; "but I must
tell you that your father does not fear anything of the sort for you. He says that you need
to go to a good school, and that he is thankful for the opportunity which is now offered. He
feels sure that you would be happy with his sister, and does not fear your growing discontented
with home. Besides, as he says, when you come back you will be able to teach the younger children,
and that will be a good object to have in view while you are studying. So we have determined
to leave it for you to decide. We will give you to-day to think it over, and to-morrow you
must tell us what you wish to do. Pray over it, Ruth, and don't let anything I have said prejudice
you against the idea of going. Indeed, dear," she added in a lower tone, "I don't think I should
have any fear for you if I were sure that you were not going alone, if I knew that you had
an almighty Friend to be with you and guide you in the right way."

It was very rarely that Mrs. Arnold said so much to any of her children, and Ruth was quite
overcome. She ran off to her own little room to give vent to her feelings, and to think over
all that she had heard.

CHAPTER III.

RUTH'S DECISION.

For the first few moments Ruth felt quite determined not to leave home; but as she thought
over the advantages and disadvantages of the plan her resolution wavered. How often she had
wished, though vainly, to go to a good boarding-school! and now there was an opportunity for
her to have a twelvemonth's education, without the great drawback of living at school among
strangers and losing the comforts and freedom of home. It was true that she had only seen her
aunt for a short time several years before, and her cousins were quite unknown, except for
the short notes she usually received at Christmas, with a present from Julia. Still they were
relatives, and would not regard her as a stranger.

There were so many arguments for accepting her aunt's invitation: the pleasure of the sea-side
trip, the change, the novelty of living in a town, of having Julia for a companion and many
school-fellows of her own age; of exchanging Miss Green's school, with its catechisms and needlework,
for a young ladies' college, with its modern plans of study, its classes and professors. And
all these inducements had the charm of being new and untried, so that only their agreeable
side appeared to view, the other being unknown.

Yet if there were fewer reasons against the plan, they were very weighty, for how would mother
contrive to do without her? And how could she bear to live a year without a glimpse of the
dear home faces?

"But I only help in the mornings and evenings," she mused, "for I am at school all day, and
perhaps I could come home for a few days at Christmas. I'm sure I don't know what to do. I
wish father and mother had settled it. It is so difficult to know how to decide."

She did not forget the advice which had been given her--to pray over the matter. Indeed, I
doubt if she would in any case have come to a decision without taking counsel of her Heavenly
Father, for Ruth had for years been in the habit of carrying her childish troubles and perplexities
to the one unfailing Guide.

And yet she was hardly sure that she was a Christian; and although she longed to set her mother's
mind at rest upon that point, she could not venture to do so just yet. Like many another child
of pious parents, she had been trained to love good and hate evil; she had been taught to pray
and to desire to live a Christian life; she had long since begun the never-ending conflict
against evil and tried to rule her life and actions by God's Word; and yet she could not tell
whether the promptings and impulses towards the Saviour which often came to her heart, were
merely the result of the loving sanctified home-influence which had surrounded her from her
birth, or if she had indeed become a disciple, though but a feeble one, of the meek and lowly
Jesus.

In the quiet calm of a summer day, when the wind scarcely ruffles the waters of the bay, it
is difficult to say whether the fair ship riding at anchor will prove herself seaworthy. It
is when the storm rises in its fury and the billows dash over her that the testing time comes,
and she proves the strength of her bows and the soundness of her timbers, or she sinks a hopeless
wreck.

And it remained for Ruth's visit to Busyborough, to test her and prove how strong was her desire
to follow Christ. If it were but a weak earth-born feeling, it would soon be upset by the winds
of temptation; but if it were indeed of God, although it might be roughly handled and somewhat
shaken for a time, it would come forth triumphant at last.

"Well, Ruth, what do you intend to do?" asked her father, as they sat at breakfast the next
morning. "Do you intend to go to Busyborough, and find out how ignorant you are, and then set
to work to study with all your might, or do you mean to be the pattern eldest scholar at Miss
Green's? Do you mean to rub shoulders with others, or are you going to stay at home and fancy
yourself a prodigy of wisdom and learning?"

"I think, that if you and mother can spare me, I will go to Busyborough, and rub shoulders
with the others," said Ruth, steadily.

"That's right; I am glad to hear it; for although we shall miss you very much, I am sure the
change will benefit you. Go and learn all the good you can, and tell us all about it when you
come back. Ah! your mother looks grave: I know she rather fears your picking up some fantastical
notions and growing to look down on your own people. But I don't fear it. I look forward to
seeing my little Ruth again next summer, grown somewhat taller, perhaps, and wiser too, but
still always my own Ruth."

"Yes, father," she answered, with something like a sob.

But Will, the eldest brother, who found that his father's speech and Ruth's face were getting
too much for his feelings, jumped up and seized his hat, saying in his queer way that he must
be off to the hay-field if there was a prospect of showers, and he hoped Ruth would not run
away before he came back.

The other members of the family soon dispersed; and although Ruth's departure was for days
the all-absorbing topic of conversation, it was generally referred to in a cheery way, and
not in what Will called "the sentimental strain."

CHAPTER IV.

THE JOURNEY.

Several letters passed between Mrs. Arnold and her sister-in-law; and as it was arranged that
Ruth was to go the following week, there was not much time for preparation, and every spare
minute was fully occupied. Her entire wardrobe had to be inspected and replenished, as far
as slender means would permit; old garments were made to look as much like new as possible,
and little bits of ribbon and lace which had not seen the light for years, because there were
so few suitable occasions for wearing them in a quiet country place, now reappeared in the
form of bows and tuckers for the neck.

As Mrs. Woburn, Ruth's aunt, lived a great many miles from Cressleigh, it was decided that
her niece should go direct to Stonegate, the watering-place where they were to spend the holidays.
She was therefore to take a long railway journey, quite an event in itself, as she had rarely
been farther by rail than the county town, twelve miles distant, and even there she had always
been accompanied by her father or mother. But just now there was so much to be done on the
farm, that her father could spare neither the time nor money for a long journey, and the young
girl was obliged to travel alone, a formidable undertaking, which seemed almost to spoil the
anticipated pleasure of the sea-side visit.

One bright morning in the early part of July, Ruth woke with the thought, "I am really going
away to-day, and perhaps I may not sleep in this dear little room for a whole year, or for
six months at least."

She had rarely called her chamber a "dear little room" before; in fact, she had often grumbled
because it was so small; but now that she was about to go away it had suddenly become dear,
for was it not part of her home, and what place in the world could ever be so dear as home?

How strange it all seemed that morning! The coming downstairs and finding the little trunk
packed and corded in the hall; the hurried breakfast, at which every one but mother talked
very fast, because they had so much to say and such a short time in which to say it; the leave-takings,
the good-byes, and parting injunctions.

Ruth drove off at last beside her father, feeling like one in a dream, so dimly did she see
everything through the mist of tears which hung about her eyes.

There was another farewell to be said at the railway junction, for Mr. Arnold could only wait
a few minutes to see her into a comfortable carriage, and then returned home to Cressleigh.
When he waved his hand and the train was fairly in motion, Ruth began to realize that she was
being separated for a long, long time from all whom she loved best in the world; she heaved
one great sob, and crouching into a corner of the carriage gave way to a flood of tears. She
wept for several minutes undisturbed, then a kind motherly-looking lady, who was sitting opposite
to her, asked, "What is the matter, my dear? Are you going away to school?"

"Yes, ma'am; at least, I mean no, not yet. I am going to the sea-side to stay with my cousins
for a few weeks."

"I don't think that most girls would be so distressed at the thought of a visit to the sea-side,"
said the old lady, smiling.

"But I'm not coming back for ever so long," replied Ruth, drying her tears, however. Then she
informed her new friend how long she was going to be away, and what she hoped to see and do
during her absence from home, and the old lady seemed so much interested that Ruth soon grew
bright and merry, and began to notice the pretty country through which they were passing; and
when the train stopped at a rustic station, where a little pony trap was waiting to convey
the old lady to her own home, they felt as if they had known each other for years instead of
hours, and were really very sorry to part.

The rest of the journey seemed rather dull and tedious, and it was late in the afternoon when
the train drew up at the Stonegate station. There were a good many people on the platform,
and Ruth was wondering if any one had come to meet her, when a lady looked in at the carriage
door and inquired in a pleasant manner, "Your name is Ruth Arnold, is it not?"

"Yes, it is," she replied rather shyly, as she bent forward to look at her aunt. But that look
told her a great deal.

She saw a fair placid face which she felt sure she should love, for the dark blue eyes reminded
her of her father's, though the fair hair and small mouth were strangely unlike his. But there
was something familiar in the tone of her voice, and when she called a cab, gave instructions
about the luggage, and took her seat beside her niece, Ruth was quite at ease and felt that
she was going to be happy.

"You will see Julia very soon," said Mrs. Woburn, "but this is our first day at the sea-side,
and she was out when I started. I am afraid that she will be angry with me, for I know that
she intended to come herself to meet you, and I think she will be disappointed."

"It was very kind of you to come," said Ruth; "I was getting quite frightened, and thought
that perhaps you might not know me, and that I should be all alone in a strange place."

"There is not much fear that any one who has seen your mother would not recognise her daughter,"
was Mrs. Woburn's smiling reply.

"Do you think me so much like her?" asked Ruth eagerly, looking greatly pleased.

"Indeed I do. But this is our lodging. I see Julia looking out of the window."

In another minute Ruth had followed her aunt into a large cheerful sitting-room, with two bay-windows
overlooking the beach and sea.

"Oh! mamma, what a shame of you to go without me!" cried a voice from the window where a young
girl was standing.

"You were so late, dear," said Mrs. Woburn gently. "Here is your cousin; take her to her room;
I am sure she must be tired after her long journey."

Julia, a pretty fair-haired fashionably-dressed girl, came forward and shook hands, saying,
"How d'ye do, Ruth? I am glad mamma met you. Will you come upstairs?"

She led the way to a pretty bedroom, much larger than the one in which Ruth had slept at Cressleigh.
There was a splendid view of the sea from the windows, and the furniture of the room was all
of light polished wood; a pretty dressing-table stood between the windows, which were hung
with white muslin curtains, and the hangings and cover-lids of the two little beds were snowy
white.

"What a pretty room!" said Ruth, as she entered.

"Do you think so? I think it is awfully small and poky. And we are both to sleep here, which
I am sure will be very inconvenient; but we couldn't get anything better, so I suppose we must
put up with it. Lodgings are always the great drawback to the sea-side, you know."

Ruth did not know what reply to make, she was so taken aback by the grandeur of Julia's air
and manner.

CHAPTER V.

COUSINS.

"Tea is ready, miss," said a trim maid-servant at the door of the bedroom where the two girls
were talking, and Ruth followed her cousin downstairs to the large cheerful room she had entered
upon her arrival.

Mrs. Woburn had already taken her seat behind the urn, and the two boys who were sitting beside
her rose to meet their cousin. Ernest, the elder of the two, was a tall, thin lad of fifteen,
with a pair of large brown eyes, the only striking feature in his plain but sensible face.

Rupert was a merry little schoolboy of seven, bright-eyed and curly-haired, a mischievous little
sprite, no doubt, but a very affectionate lovable little fellow. He chattered continually during
the meal, and did a great deal to take off the sense of shyness that Ruth felt in the company
of Julia and Ernest, and her aunt asked questions about the farm-life at Cressleigh, and talked
of their plans for the next few weeks.

"Oh! you will have a great deal to see," said Julia, "as this is your first visit to the sea-side.
I think we had better put on our hats and go for a long walk at once, it is a shame to be indoors
this lovely evening."

"That will hardly do for your cousin, dear; she looks rather tired, and we must remember that
she has had a long journey to-day."

Ruth was very tired, and, much as she longed to go for a walk along the shore, she felt that
that pleasure must be deferred until the next morning. But she was rather dismayed by Julia's
saying, "Well, I don't see any reason for our remaining indoors. Of course Ernest won't come,
he is too much taken up with that book about--shellology. So he can stay with Ruth while you
come out with us."

"Why can't you call things by their right names, and say 'conchology'?" asked Ernest quietly.

"Really, Julia, I don't think we must leave your cousin this evening," said Mrs. Woburn, doubtfully.

"Don't stay at home on my account, auntie," replied Ruth, putting aside her own feelings, though
she did not much like the idea of spending the evening with Ernest, such a grave, quiet boy,
so very different from her brothers.

Julia carried her point, and started in a few minutes for a walk with her mother and Rupert,
leaving the cousins to their own resources. Ruth took a seat near the window, and watched the
waves breaking gently upon the beach, while the boy appeared to be entirely occupied with his
book. It was rather dull, this first evening away from home; it seemed scarcely possible that
she had really only left Cressleigh that morning, and she began to wonder if they had missed
her very much, and what they were doing now, and when she should see them all again, and as
she thought of the months that must elapse first she heaved a weary sigh.

The sigh roused Ernest, who had quite forgotten his companion in the charms of his book, and
he at once endeavoured to make amends for his neglect in his kind but awkward way.

"Oh! I beg your pardon," he began, "I almost forgot--do you like conchology?" he asked, by
way of starting a conversation.

"I don't know anything about it," was Ruth's meek reply, "but I believe it is the science of
shells, is it not?"

"Yes. I thought you wouldn't care for it. Girls never do."

"Perhaps I might learn," she said humbly; "but I haven't had a chance to study any 'ologies,'
they did not teach them at Miss Green's. Are you studying it as a holiday task?"

"No, for amusement. They won't let me study in the holidays, but I enjoy this. Just look at
these shells, aren't they beauties?" and he showed her one of the illustrations in his book.

"Oh! how beautiful!" she exclaimed; and the boy, seeing she was interested, told her what he
had been reading, and promised to get her some specimens the next day, and the time slipped
rapidly by, until Mrs. Woburn and Julia returned.

"What have you been doing all the evening?" asked Julia, when they were in their room that
night. "Was Ernest civil?"

"He was very kind, and showed me his book on conchology, and explained about the shells, and
he is going to get me some specimens to-morrow."

"Indeed!" said Julia, rather surprised, "I should not have thought that you cared for that
sort of thing."

Ruth was too tired to answer, and had soon forgotten the events of the day in sound refreshing
sleep. When she awoke, the sun was shining brightly, and she was astonished to find that she
had slept until half-past seven. She was accustomed to rise very early at home, and was afraid
that her cousins would be shocked at her laziness, until she found that Julia was still sleeping
quietly in the bed beside her.

"Julia! Julia!" she cried, "it's very late. We must get up at once."

"What is the time?" was asked drowsily.

"Half-past seven."

"Why can't you let me rest?" said Julia crossly. "We always breakfast at eight at home, but
I don't intend to get up so early at the sea-side."

She closed her eyes and went to sleep again; but Ruth, who was wide awake, rose at once, dressed
quickly, brushed her brown curls, and went downstairs. There was no one about, and the morning
air was so fresh, and the sunshine so inviting, that she took her hat and ran down to the beach,
feeling so full of joy and gladness that she could hardly restrain herself from singing, as
she often did in the fields at Cressleigh. The sunlight sparkled upon the crested waves as
they broke gently upon the shore, and the tide came in, slowly creeping up the shingle, now
bearing away a dry piece of sea-weed and making it look alive and fresh, advancing and retreating,
yet ever creeping slowly upward, until one wave almost broke over her feet and reminded her
of the old and oft-repeated adage, "Time and tide wait for no man."

She hurried back, to find her aunt and cousins waiting breakfast for her; and as she told them
about her morning ramble, she did not notice the unpleasant glances which Julia bestowed upon
her dress, a blue cotton one, made very simply, but somewhat old-fashioned, and washed until
the colour was rather faded.

"We must certainly go out this lovely morning," said Mrs. Woburn after breakfast. "Where do
you think your cousin would like to go, dear?"

"Oh! we'll go to the Esplanade of course," replied Julia, as she ran off to get ready. She
came down a few minutes later looking very nice in her pretty holland dress trimmed with red,
and shady straw hat with muslin and lace bows, and dainty gloves.

"You don't mean to say that you are going out like that, Ruth!" she exclaimed, as she caught
sight of her cousin sitting by the window still wearing her print dress and shabby straw hat.

"Yes," she replied, and was going to ask "Why not?" but the sight of her cousin's simple but
pretty costume stopped her, and she blushed rosy red.

"Then of course we cannot go to the Esplanade," said Julia in a pointed manner.

CHAPTER VI.

STONEGATE.

"The Esplanade did you say, girls?" asked Mrs. Woburn, entering at that moment.

"No, mamma, we don't care about it; any other place will do," replied Julia sulkily.

"We will walk along the beach to Brill Head then," said Mrs. Woburn, "and I dare say Ernest
would like to accompany us; he will find plenty of specimens there."

"Shall I stay at home, Aunt Annie?" asked Ruth timidly.

"Certainly not, unless you wish it; Julia has been longing to have you for a companion, and
this will be such a delightful walk."

But the pleasure of the walk was gone for Ruth. Julia was quiet, and scarcely spoke to any
one, and her mother could not understand what was the matter, and although she tried her best
to bring back the look of delight to her niece's face, she was not successful. It was not until
they reached Brill Head, and Ernest began his search for specimens, that Ruth recovered her
wonted liveliness, and the sunshine returned to her face and the gladness to her heart, and
she felt so full of life and energy that she challenged Rupert to a race.

"Just look at her, mamma!" exclaimed Julia, who was sitting beside her mother on a rustic seat.
"Did you ever see any one so wild and vulgar? And that frightful dress, as old-fashioned as
possible! To think of our going on the Esplanade with her!"

"Is that the reason you did not wish to go there?"

"Of course it was. Every one would have stared at her antiquated dress. Indeed, she is altogether
old-fashioned; she actually asked me last night if I had any dolls, and if I went to Sunday-school.
I didn't think that having a poor relation to live with us would be quite so annoying and humiliating."

Mrs. Woburn was very seldom angry with her spoilt child, but now she was thoroughly roused,
and said in low distinct tones, "Remember, Julia, that you speak of my brother's daughter.
While Ruth is here she will be treated as your sister. You little know what you owe to your
uncle, and if I ever hear you speak in that contemptuous way of any of his family I will send
you to your room at once."

Such a threat was quite strange to Julia, who at fourteen began to consider herself almost
grown-up, and quite above reproof or punishment; but it was sufficiently determined to prevent
her making any more remarks of the sort in her mother's hearing, though it did not increase
her affection for her cousin.

During the walk home Ruth was merry as ever, romping with Rupert, chatting with that usually
shy lad, Ernest, and planning an afternoon on the shore to collect sea-weeds. But Julia walked
slowly beside her mother, so evidently determined to be silent that the rest of the party tacitly
agreed to leave her to herself.

Mr. Woburn and his eldest son, Gerald, arrived at Stonegate that afternoon, and Ruth saw them
for the first time. She soon felt at home with her uncle, a plain-featured, middle-aged man
of business, but with his son she felt wonderfully shy. It seemed hardly possible that the
handsome young man with the dark moustache and manly bearing could be her cousin. She had expected
to see a boy two or three years older than Will, but still a boy, not a polite and self-possessed
young man, who by his way of speaking to her made her feel a very little girl indeed.

"How have you been improving the shining hours, my lad?" was his greeting to Ernest.

"He has been down on the shore collecting shells for Ruth," said Julia mischievously.

"Ernest becoming a lady's man! Dear me! the country cousin is working wonders," he cried in
feigned surprise.

Ruth felt the hot blood rushing to her cheeks, though she tried to look as if she had not heard
the remark; but it spoilt her pleasure in seeking for shells, and she decided mentally that
she should never like Cousin Gerald. The arrival of her brother seemed to have restored Julia's
good-humour, and when in the evening he proposed a stroll on the pier she gladly assented,
and the whole party set out to hear the band which played there two or three evenings in the week.

Ruth thought that she had never known anything so charming as that evening. It was so pleasant
to sit in a sheltered corner listening to the finest music she had ever heard, played by a
military band and accompanied by the gentle splash of the waves against the pier; to feel the
cool fresh sea-breeze blowing around her, and to see the gay dresses of the ladies as they
walked up and down talking to their friends, until by-and-by the quiet stars came out and the
silver moon shone upon the scene.

Julia was not contented to sit still and look on; she begged Gerald to let her promenade with
him, and for a few minutes he gratified her whim; but Ruth, although she had changed the dress
which had proved so obnoxious that morning, did not consider herself to be attired richly enough
to mingle with the gay throng that passed and re-passed her in her quiet corner.

"What do you think of Gerald?" asked Julia, when the two girls had retired to their bedroom
that evening. "Is he not very handsome?"

"Yes," said Ruth, glad that her cousin had asked a question to which she could give her assent
so easily. "But I didn't know that he was so old; I expected he would be a boy."

"He is only nineteen," said Julia; "but I am sure he looks older."

"Only nineteen! Why, Will is seventeen, and he is quite a boy compared with Cousin Gerald."

"That is very likely, for he has been brought up in the country, and that makes a great difference.
Now I am sure that Gerald knows quite as much as most men do, and I think it is too bad for
father to treat him like a boy."

"Does he?" asked Ruth innocently.

"Yes; he won't even allow him to have a latch-key, and then he complains if Gerald is rather
late home in the evening, and he has to sit up for him. And even mamma annoys him dreadfully
sometimes by calling him 'her dear boy.'"

"I thought mothers did that even when their sons were quite grown up," said Ruth.

"I don't think they should," was Julia's reply. "But it is quite too bad of papa to expect
poor Gerald to slave away in that office all day. He is quite a tyrant, and grudges the poor
fellow any pleasure."

"Julia! Julia! I am sure it is very wrong of you to talk in that way of your parents," cried
Ruth reproachfully. "Don't you know the Bible says, 'Honour thy father and mother'?"

"What an old-fashioned, tiresome creature you are!" muttered Julia in a sleepy voice.

CHAPTER VII.

A POOR RELATION.

"When are we to have the picnic, mamma?" asked Julia at breakfast the next morning.

"Any day will suit me; but as your father and Gerald will only be here for a short time, I
think we must arrange to have it as early as possible the week after next."

"Let us have it on Monday. Yes, Monday," cried Rupert and Julia together.

"I am going out boating on Monday," said Gerald lazily.

"Tuesday or Wednesday," suggested Mrs. Woburn.

"I am engaged for Tuesday also, but Wednesday is clear, I believe," replied the young man in
a careless manner, as if it did not signify much to him whether he formed one of the party or not.

"How horrid of you to put it off so long," exclaimed his sister angrily. "I daresay Wednesday
will be wet."

"Nous verrons," he replied, as he sauntered from the room with his hands in his pockets. He
looked in again at the door to say, "I shall not be back until the evening, mother;" and in
another moment the banging of the front-door told them that he had left the house.

"It is too bad of Gerald to go off like that the very first day he is here," said Julia. "I
suppose he has taken his bicycle and gone out with his friends, the Goodes. Horrid people!
Yes, there he is," she cried as Gerald and two other young men on bicycles passed the house
bowing and smiling towards the window where the two girls were standing.

"Gerald out with the Goodes? I wish he would choose some other companions," said Mr. Woburn,
who had scarcely noticed their previous conversation.

"You see how papa finds fault with him," whispered Julia to her cousin.

"Ruth, I want you to come to my room for a few minutes," said Mrs. Woburn; and her niece followed
her upstairs.

"I should like you to try on these things and see how they fit you," she said, as she pointed
to some pretty dresses spread out on the bed. There was a pale pink, trimmed with dainty white
lace; a figured sateen covered with tiny rosebuds, and finished off here and there with knots
and bows of rose-coloured ribbon; a simple holland dress trimmed with white braid, and a shady
straw hat with bows of lace and a tiny bunch of rosebuds. Ruth gazed at the garments with admiration
and astonishment, then she glanced at her own shabby print frock, blushed rosy red, and the
tears began to gather in her eyes.

"What is the matter, Ruth? Do you not like them?" asked her aunt kindly.

"They are very pretty, and you are very kind, auntie; but I would rather not wear them," said
the girl, trying hard to repress the tears of mortification that stood in her eyes.

"But, my dear, they have been bought on purpose for you to wear at the sea-side. Do at least
try them."

"Thank you, auntie, I would much rather not do so;" and Ruth turned aside to the window, from
which she could see nothing for the mist before her eyes caused by the storm of passion and
pride surging within her breast.

There was no reply, and when she looked round again she found that she was alone. The sunshine
was streaming into the room, shining upon the white hat and the pretty dresses, just such garments
as Ruth would have chosen if she had had an opportunity of buying such a stock of clothes for
herself. But she remembered Julia's words and manner the previous morning, and felt so proud
and angry that she deliberately shut her eyes as she walked out of the room, and gave not a
thought to her aunt's kindness.

"It is too bad! I'll not stand it!" she murmured. "I did not come here to be treated like a
poor relation. If they don't like me as I am, I will go home again. Yes, I'll go and tell auntie
so at once," she continued, her pride rising higher and higher until she reached the bay-windowed
drawing-room where her aunt was sitting with Ernest. She did not observe his presence, but
went straight to her aunt, her cheeks crimson and her eyes flashing.

"Aunt Annie," she said as calmly as her emotion would permit, "Aunt Annie, I think that I had
better go home."

"My dear child, what is the matter?" cried Mrs. Woburn, dropping her work in her amazement.

"I think that if you don't like me as I am, I had better go home," she repeated.

"What do you mean?" asked her aunt, still more perplexed; while Ernest looked up from his book
and inquired, "Has Julia been annoying her?"

"No," said Ruth; "but, oh, auntie! I can't bear to be--a poor relation, and--and have clothes
given me."

The pent-up sobs would have their way at last, and the girl sank down beside her aunt, who
tried to soothe and comfort her.

"Have those dresses troubled you so much, dear?" she asked gently. "I had no idea that that
was the cause of your annoyance, but fancied you did not like the style in which they were
made. If I had thought that you would have any objection I would have acted differently; but
as your mother----"

"Did mother know that you were getting them for me?" inquired Ruth.

"Yes, and she wrote to say that she should be glad for you to be treated in every way like
your cousin. And you must never think, dear, that we regard you as 'a poor relation.' Remember
that your father is my brother, and whatever I give you has been paid for, and far more than
paid for, years ago."

"Thank you, auntie; I am glad to know that," she said quietly.

"I did not think you were so proud, Ruth," whispered Ernest as she left the room, and went
up to her own chamber to have a good cry over her foolish behaviour. But, to her dismay, Julia
was there dressing for a walk, an occupation which she knew would take her a considerable time.

Oh, how she longed for her little room at home, where she had so often taken her childish troubles,
or for a quiet nook upon the shore, such as she had often read of, but which is rarely to be
found in a fashionable watering-place. There was no solitude for her just then, and she was
obliged to fight the battle within silently, while her companion rallied her upon her mournful
looks and red eyes; and to send up her prayer for help from the heart, without using the lips.
But help came, and she conquered at last the pride and temper of which she was now thoroughly
ashamed. She was anxious to obtain her aunt's forgiveness for the rude reception of her kindness,
and tried to make amends by arraying herself in the pink dress and pretty hat, which she showed
to Julia, saying how kind it was of auntie to get such lovely things for her. By-and-by when
she had an opportunity she said in a low voice, "I am very sorry that I was so proud and rude
just now, auntie. I'll try to behave better in future."

And Mrs. Woburn, looking at her niece's dress, saw that her repentance was not only expressed
in words.

CHAPTER VIII.

SEA-SIDE PLEASURES.

A week spent at Stonegate had taught Ruth more of her own frailties and weaknesses, and had
shown her more of the various sorts of people of which the world is composed, than she would
have learnt in a whole year spent in the quiet sheltered seclusion of her home at Cressleigh.

The novelty, the continued round of pleasure, the excitement and gaiety, were bewildering and
delightful to the simple country girl. It seemed to her that she had been suddenly transported
from the commonplace ordinary work-a-day world in which she had hitherto dwelt, to a fairyland
of sunshine, music, and pleasure. It was almost impossible at times to realize that the sun
which brightened the Esplanade, and gilded the edge of the rippling waves, was the same sun
which was shining upon her father's harvest-field at home, upon the labourers toiling at the
sickle, the women binding the sheaves, and the servants briskly moving hither and thither,
all as busy as bees throughout the whole of the long summer day.

Everything at the sea-side was new to Ruth, and she exulted in the freshness and novelty of
all around her, for she was still at that happy age

    "When all things pleased, for life itself was new,
     And the heart promised what the fancy drew."

Alas, that that time is being gradually shortened, and that children say good-bye at such an
early age to the simple pleasures of youth!

How few years there are in which one can be young, and how many in which one must be old!

But Ruth was still young, far younger in her capacity to enjoy than Julia, who was her junior
by some months. She was in good health, with fine animal spirits, and had not tasted half the
pleasures which had already grown stale to her cousin. The boating, the chatter, the strolls,
the music on the pier, the glorious sunsets, the very stones and shells upon the beach, the
fresh breezes and the ever-changing sea, all contributed to afford her such pleasure as it
would have been impossible for Julia to feel, because she, poor child, was already disenchanted
at fourteen, was already wearied with frequent repetition of the amusements which were new
to her cousin, and also because she had imbibed the idea that it was ill-bred, and a mark of
ignorance, to show or even to feel extreme pleasure in anything, yet was ever selfishly seeking
some new gratification.

"You appear to be enjoying yourself very much, Ruth," observed her aunt, as she sat beside
her on the pier the evening before the day arranged for the picnic.

"How can I help it, auntie? You are so kind, and everything is so enchanting," was the enthusiastic
reply.

"I think that many of the richest people here would give all they possess to have that child's
keen sense of delight," remarked Mrs. Woburn to her husband, as Ruth tripped away to join her
cousins.

"Oh, Julia," she exclaimed, "what a charming piece the band has been playing!"

"That old thing!" replied the other contemptuously. "It is the overture to 'La Sonnambula,'
and I perfectly hate it, for I learnt it at school ages ago, and Signor Touchi used to get
awfully angry about it."

Julia often acted as a sort of wet blanket upon her cousin's enthusiastic outbursts; though
it was a long time before the country girl learnt to express her delight in the usual formula
of a fashionable young lady, "Very charming," or "Awfully nice," pronounced in a manner which
seems to imply, "Just tolerable."

Wednesday morning rose clear and bright, and soon after sunrise Ruth peeped out of the window
to see if the weather were favourable, and when she saw the sunshine she could remain in bed
no longer, but dressed quickly and ran down to the beach, her favourite retreat in the early
morning, and the only place where she ever found an opportunity for quiet thought amidst all
the excitement of pleasure-seeking.

What a long time it seemed since she had left home! And yet it was only a few days. What would
her mother think, she wondered, of the life she was leading now? She had only received one
short letter from her, written after all the rest of the household were in bed, and Ruth could
guess how very busy every one was, although there was but a casual reference to the fact in
the letter.

"I hope that mother is not doing too much," she mused, "it was very kind of her to let me have
so much pleasure; but how hard it would be to go back now after all this gaiety. I trust that
I am not getting spoilt, yet----"

"Have you been looking for anemones, Ruth?" asked a boyish voice beside her. "This is not the
place to find them."

"I had no idea that you were near, Ernest," was her reply, "but I have not been looking for
anything, only thinking."

"Well, it is almost breakfast time now. You know that we are to be early this morning on account
of the picnic to which you are all going."

"But surely you are going with us?" said Ruth in surprise.

"No," he answered quietly, "I should only be in the way. Gerald and his fellows don't want
me, and Julia and her friends only snub me and think me a nuisance, and of course I am too
old to romp and be petted like little Ru. So I shall have a quiet day on the shore collecting
fresh specimens, and you shall see them to-morrow. Now we must go in to breakfast."

Ernest had grown very fond of his country cousin, who was so different from his sister and
her friends that she could actually take an interest in his pursuits, and who, under her father's
guidance, had learnt many interesting facts of natural history which the town-bred boy had
never had opportunities of observing.

Breakfast was a hurried meal, and directly it was over there followed the bustle of preparation
for the day's excursion. Hampers were sent off, duly packed with all kinds of delicacies; Rupert
was running up and down stairs continually, and getting in the way as much as Ernest, who remained
stationary near the door; while Julia rushed from her room to her mother's, declaring that
she was quite certain they would all be late, and then ran back to ask Ruth to help her to dress.

CHAPTER IX.

THE PICNIC.

Everything was ready at last, and the whole family started for the pier, where they were to
meet their friends. Such a crowd of people surrounded them upon their arrival, that Ruth, who
merely knew a few of them slightly, felt quite over-whelmed, and wished that her usual companion,
Ernest, had been beside her.

The steamer which had been chartered for the occasion now came alongside the pier, and every
one was occupied with the business of embarking. When all the party were safely on board, Ruth
found herself amongst a number of strangers, far away from Julia, who had evidently quite forgotten
her, and was laughing and chatting with a little group of girls at the other end of the vessel.
Her aunt was entertaining the ladies, and her uncle walking up and down the deck in earnest
conversation with two gentlemen; Rupert was trying to get on the paddle-box, and there was
no one near her but Gerald, the facetious leader of a knot of young men. Ruth felt very lonely
and rather sorrowful; she had been eagerly anticipating this picnic, and now she seemed to
be quite neglected, while every one else was gay and happy. She had not the courage to make
her way through the visitors to reach Julia at the other end of the boat, for she had an undefined
feeling that if she went she would not be welcomed there. Her thoughts flew back to the one
spot of earth where she was always wanted and ever welcomed, and she heaved a little sigh.

"What is the matter, my fair coz?" asked Gerald, who was standing near and heard the sigh.
"Are the Fates very unpropitious?"

"No, Cousin Gerald," she answered shyly.

She could not understand the young man who patronized her, and talked to her as if she were
a little child, and she fancied that he was making fun of her.

"Then why do you sigh?" he inquired.

"I have nothing else to do," she said, smiling.

"Has Julia left you without any introduction? Well, we will soon remedy that," he said as he
led her towards a very fair young girl, dressed in blue and white, and having introduced the
two girls he left them talking, and strolled off with a friend.

Ruth's companion was by no means shy, she had a great deal to say, and began by making remarks
upon the people on board, and telling little scraps of their personal histories.

"You see that old gentleman walking with Mr. Woburn. That is Mr. Amass, the banker. They say
that he is awfully rich, but I am sure that he is a terrible screw. Only look at his wife,
and see how shabbily she dresses. Don't you see her over there with the daisies in her bonnet?
And that is her niece, Miss Game, flirting with Mr. Trim. Ah! he is walking away now; he prefers
a chat with Edith Thorpe. How amused they look! I suppose he is telling her what Miss Game
has been saying. Yes, I am sure they are laughing at her!"

"But surely," said Ruth, looking rather shocked, "he would not be so rude as to talk to a young
lady, and then go away and laugh at her!"

"My dear child," replied the other, laughing, "every one does it, more or less."

"But are none of them friends? Do none of them care for each other sufficiently to refrain
from laughing?" asked Ruth earnestly.

"Very few persons care enough for their friends to be quiet about their follies and weaknesses,"
replied this worldly-wise young lady, and then she continued her running commentary upon the
visitors until the steamer arrived at its destination, a beautiful little bay where the water
was so clear that one could see the sea-weeds growing underneath. Tall trees grew not far from
the shore, and upon a slight eminence was situated an old castle, not possessing many historical
associations, but in a fairly good state of preservation, and much frequented by pleasure parties
from Stonegate.

The older ladies at once made their way to a shady nook under the trees, and the rest of the
party strolled about the grounds in twos and threes until a tempting repast had been spread,
not upon the grass, but upon long wooden tables in the castle yard.

Ruth was utterly astonished. Her ideas of a picnic were gathered from the simple and joyous
little parties held in the woods near her home, when the hamper, filled with cold meat, tartlets,
and milk or lemonade, was sent on in the milk cart or one of the farm wagons, a white cloth
was spread under the shade of a tree, and the whole party sat on the grass round it, and were
merry and lively, regarding the little accidents which would occasionally happen as so much
cause for mirth.

But this sumptuous collation, with its garnished dishes of poultry and joints, salads, tarts,
jellies, blancmange, ices and champagne, with various fruits, all tastefully arranged, and
the accessories of glass and flowers, silver forks and spoons, and long seats, with waiters
hurrying about, made a picnic quite a different affair, and--Ruth was unfashionable enough
to think--took away all the fun of it. She could see that her aunt was somewhat anxious, and
was quite as vexed at any slight accident which occurred as if she had been giving a party
in her own house.

Of course there were several toasts and a good deal of speech-making, and a considerable quantity
of champagne was drunk before the guests left the tables and dispersed, some to the tennis
court, others to explore the castle, and a few to take a country walk in the green lanes.

The afternoon was very warm, but the hush of the summer's stillness was broken by the merry
voices of the girls as they made their way through the old castle and peeped out of the windows
at their friends in the tennis court below. There was a continual flutter of light dresses
through the low doorways and up the dingy stairs, and merry sounds of laughter echoed through
the empty chambers. It was the first castle that romantic little Ruth had ever seen; and although
she could not gather much of its history from the little books sold at the gate, she tried
to imagine the scenes that had been enacted there, to people it with knights in armour, and
to fancy that the girlish faces which peeped through the windows were those of "fayre ladyes"
of bygone days.

She was aroused from her day-dream by a scream from one of the girls, and saw Gerald, looking
white and scared, hurrying towards a small door leading to the keep. The tennis players ceased
their game, all eyes were turned in one direction, and a frightened whisper ran through the
crowd as Mr. Woburn hastened across the ground. On the very edge of a broken tottering wall
projecting from the side of the keep sat Rupert--ever an adventurous little fellow--his face
white and his legs dangling. He had crept up into the keep alone, and climbed as high as he
could, just to give them all a fright. And he had succeeded, but not without risk to himself,
for the shriek of terror which some one gave upon seeing him had awakened him to a sense of
his danger, and looking down upon the terrified faces below he grew frightened and almost lost
the power to keep his seat. It was a terrible moment, and every one paused in horror-stricken
silence.

"That's right, Ruey, sit still!" cried a clear, ringing voice. "Shall I come up to keep you
company? But you must get to the other end of the wall. Don't try to crawl; push yourself along
like this," cried Ruth, sitting on a low fence and propelling herself sideways, clutching it
with her hands on either side, quite regardless of the notice she was attracting. It was the
best thing she could have done, for the boy, hearing her cheery tones and seeing that the faces
below were no longer upturned in terror, began to regain his courage, and imitated his cousin's
movements, thus getting farther and farther from the dangerous corner and nearer to the firmer
masonry of the keep, through which the young men were hurrying to his rescue. Slowly and awkwardly
he shuffled along, and reached the end of the wall just as Ruth reached the end of her fence,
for she had kept on all the time for the sake of example.

"Thank God he is safe!" cried Mr. Woburn, as Gerald caught the little fellow in his arms and
disappeared within the walls of the building.

"And this young lady has saved him," said a gentleman who had just appeared upon the scene.
He had been taking a country ramble, had seen the boy's danger from a considerable distance,
and arrived, almost breathless, in the castle yard just as Rupert was lifted from his perilous
position.

"If he had fainted or turned giddy he must have fallen, and that wall would not have borne
another person. Indeed, if the boy had not been a very light weight, I am afraid it would have
given way;" and as if to verify his words a small piece of stone, which had probably been loosened
by the boy's movements, came crashing down from the wall.

Ruth was now the universal object of attention, and she felt dreadfully bashful and awkward
as one after another gathered round her and praised "her wonderful presence of mind," and "her
remarkable courage." "So fearless, too," said one young dandy, who would not on any account
have risked his dainty limbs. "I really thought she was going to climb up and fetch him down."

"I should not have been surprised if she had done so," said a young lady near him.

The poor girl blushed, and began to wonder if she had done rightly in calling out so loudly
and drawing every one's attention to herself, for her mother had always told her that a young
girl should seek to avoid notice.

"And yet," she thought, "it cannot be wrong. I only wanted to cheer little Ru, and I could
not stop to think of any other way."

CHAPTER X.

BUSYBOROUGH.

The appearance of little Rupert in the castle yard diverted attention from his blushing cousin,
while friends and relatives crowded round him to scold, applaud, or pet, as they deemed fit.
His mother, overcome by the anxiety and suspense of those terrible moments, fainted directly
he was brought down to her, but was soon restored, and grew very anxious that the affair should
not interfere with the happiness of her guests. Some, indeed, proposed returning at once to
Stonegate, but they were overruled by the younger members of the party, who were anxious to
remain until the moon had risen, and also by Mrs. Woburn's desire not to curtail their enjoyment;
and it was finally settled that the steamer should not return until ten o'clock.

Tea, coffee, and other refreshments were handed round, and the interrupted games were resumed
and carried on until the summer evening grew chilly. The dew began to fall, and gave warning
that it was too late for out-of-door sports, and drove them into the shelter of the old castle,
where the young people proposed a dance. There was a spacious room in the lower part of the
building which had been often used for such a purpose, and after hunting up a village musician
and pressing him into their service, hats and wraps were thrown aside and the dancing commenced.
Ruth did not understand the steps, but sat down near the married ladies and looked on at what,
to her unaccustomed eyes, was a gay and lively scene. Yet she could not enter into it as she
had entered into the pleasures of the preceding days. She could not forget the alarm of the
afternoon; she was sure that her aunt was feeling ill and weary, and she felt that the gaiety
around was rather ill-timed and out of harmony with the feelings of the hostess. The hours
passed slowly to those who were merely looking on, but at ten the dancing ceased, the old fiddler
was dismissed, and amidst a great deal of laughter and chatter the gay party left the castle
and made their way to the steamer.

The moon was shining brilliantly, and the walls of the old castle gleamed in its light or were
hidden in dense shadow by the surrounding trees. The steamer lay in the little bay just below,
every inch of her visible in the moonlight, and all agreed that it was a perfect night for
a water trip.

Ruth longed for a little quiet, and strove to escape from her lively companions, whose mirth
did not accord with her feelings. She sat in a sheltered corner, and looked at the vast expanse
of water and at the quiet stars keeping watch overhead. Nothing so much reminded her of home
as the stars, which shone upon her just as they had shone at home, and with the thought of
home came a remembrance of the Heavenly Father of whom she had thought so little lately, but
who had watched over her unceasingly and had helped her that day to save her little cousin
from a horrible fate.

Mr. Woburn and Gerald returned to Busyborough a few days after the picnic, and the remaining
weeks of the sea-side holiday passed all too quickly for Ruth, who was never tired of the delights
of sea and shore and all the varied amusements that Stonegate afforded.

Still, she was anxious to commence her studies at the young ladies' college her cousin attended,
and spent many an hour thinking of it and trying to imagine what the school, the governesses,
and the pupils would be like. It was of little use to question Julia, who always declared that
she "didn't want to be bothered about school in the holidays," and that Ruth would soon find
out "how horrid it was."

It was in September that they bade farewell to Stonegate and left for Busyborough. The days
were growing shorter and colder, and as the railway journey occupied two or three hours it
was late in the day when they reached their destination, and the street lamps and shop windows
were all aglow with gas-light.

What a large noisy place it seemed to country-bred Ruth, as their cab rattled through street
after street brilliantly lighted, down long roads, past handsome houses and gardens, until
it stopped before a large many-windowed house, with a long flight of stone steps and a small
garden, enclosed by massive iron railings.

Rupert and Julia ran up the steps and disappeared, and Ruth followed her aunt into the tile-paved
hall, where two servants were waiting to receive them. It was a home-coming to all the others,
but to the country cousin it was quite strange and new.

"It is good to be at home again," said Mrs. Woburn. "Come, Ruth, I will show you your room."

She led the way upstairs and opened the door of a pleasant little room, furnished tastefully
with every requisite for a young girl's apartment. Everything was so pretty, and the bright
fire burning in the grate gave the room such a cosy look, that Ruth was delighted, and tried
to express her grateful thanks, but was simply bidden to make herself at home and to be very happy.

Left alone in the room which was to be her own, she began to look around her and to admire
the pretty French bedstead, the light modern furniture, and the pictures, bookshelves, and
brackets upon the walls. How much larger and more elegant it was than the tiny room which had
been hers at Cressleigh! She felt that she was indeed growing farther away from the old life
every day. "If it were not for Julia, and the fact that I am so far from home, I could be perfectly
happy here," was her mental comment.

They were two large "if's," and Julia was the one which occupied the principal share of her
thoughts. She did not "take to" her cousin, neither did she try to make the best of the very
apparent fact that their tastes were dissimilar. Instead of seeking for points on which they
could agree, she allowed her mind to dwell continually upon their diversity, and was beginning
to return her cousin's ill-concealed contempt for her rustic and unfashionable notions by a
growing scorn and proud dislike, which though at first secretly cherished could not fail to
show themselves in time.

CHAPTER XI.

SCHOOL-GIRL GOSSIP.

Studies will be resumed on Tuesday, 25th inst. Such was the intimation sent out by Miss Elgin,
the principal of the ladies' college which the girls were to attend.

Accordingly on Tuesday morning Ruth accompanied her cousin to Addison College, where she was
kindly received by Miss Elgin, and introduced to several of the girls, who seemed friendly
and agreeable.

The lofty spacious schoolroom, with its comfortable seats and desks, its splendid maps and
numerous modern appliances and convenient arrangements, the school library, with its rows of
standard authors in uniform binding, the music-room, the pianos--in fact, the whole establishment
exceeded Ruth's brightest dreams of school; and her desire for knowledge, which had somewhat
lessened during her sojourn at the sea-side, seemed at once to be kindled afresh.

She answered readily the questions given to test her previously acquired knowledge, and it
soon became evident that what she professed to know had been thoroughly learnt. In English
studies she was pronounced fairly proficient for her age; but in French, music, and other accomplishments
she was very backward, and she found that she would have to work very hard in order to obtain
a good place in her class.

The work of the morning was so novel and interesting to Ruth, that she was quite astonished
when the bell rang for recess, and the girls trooped off to an anteroom, where their tongues
were unloosed and the pleasures and events of the holidays were discussed, with many other topics.

"Have you heard the news about Mr. Stanley?" asked a bright lively girl, Ethel Thompson by
name, the gossip and news-monger of the school.

"No; what is it?" cried several voices.

"Well, you must keep it to yourselves, you know," she said in a confidential tone, "but he
has failed, he is a bankrupt."

"Are you sure it is true?" asked one and another.

"How do you know?"

"I am sure it is quite true, for my father was talking about it last night, and of course I
understood how it was that Mabel's place was vacant this morning," continued Ethel.

"Vacant! I should think it was! You don't suppose she would show her face here, do you?" exclaimed
Julia Woburn. "Of course no one would take any notice of her. Only fancy the idea of being
seen with a bankrupt's daughter!" she added scornfully.

"Well, it is not her fault." "I suppose she could not help it," said one or two of the girls.

"If it is not her fault it is her father's, and of course it is a great disgrace to the family.
I shouldn't think they would ever hold up their heads again," remarked Julia proudly.

"It is very sad." "I always thought them rich." "Mabel was never proud," began a chorus of
voices, but the luncheon bell ringing at that moment put an end to the conversation.

The subject was not forgotten, however, and was referred to again in the afternoon, when the
girls were preparing to return home.

"What do you think the Stanleys will do?" asked a girl of Ethel Thompson, who having brought
the news was expected to know everything relating to her unfortunate school-fellow's family
affairs.

"I don't know," replied Ethel. "Perhaps Mr. Stanley will begin business again, men do sometimes,
you know; or he may go away from the town and start elsewhere."

"The best thing he can do, I consider," cried Julia. "I can't conceive how people can show
themselves in a place where every one knows they have failed. I am sure I could not do it.
But some persons have coarse natures and do not feel things as much as others."

"I am quite sure that the Stanleys have feelings as keen as any of us," remarked a shy quiet-looking
girl. "You know how sensitive poor Mabel is, and I do hope that if she comes back we shall
all be kind to her and not let her know that we have ever heard about her father's misfortunes."

"That may be your opinion, Nora Ellis," said Julia, "but for my part I do not choose to associate
with a bankrupt's daughter. If she should return here, of course no one would speak to her;
but I do not suppose that there is any fear of it. Miss Elgin would be making a great mistake
if she were to receive Mabel Stanley, and would be ruining her school and acting against her
own interests."

"I daresay Miss Elgin will do as she thinks best," retorted Ethel Thompson, sorry to have raised
a storm which it was not easy to subdue.

Julia and Ruth did not reach school the following morning until nearly ten o'clock, the hour
at which Miss Elgin's pupils assembled for their morning classes.

They had scarcely entered the cloak-room before they became aware that something unusual had
occurred, something which was evidently connected with the young girl standing apart from the
rest, at the end of the room, and looking tearful and timid. In a moment Ruth guessed, from
the scornful expression of her cousin's face, that the new-comer was Mabel Stanley who had
been so freely discussed the previous day, and that the poor child had met with a very cool
reception on her return to school.

Pity for the unfortunate girl, indignation at the freezing glances bestowed upon her, mingled
perhaps with a vague idea of vexing Julia, caused Ruth to make a sudden resolution to befriend
her; and when upon entering the schoolroom she found that their desks were side by side, she
did not delay to take advantage of the fact and endeavour to set Mabel at ease by referring
to her occasionally for help in little matters of school routine with which she (Ruth) was
unacquainted. The questions were politely answered, but her sensitive neighbour seemed either
too proud or too shy to respond to her friendly advances.

"Ruth Arnold," exclaimed Julia in the cloak-room at the close of the day, when Mabel Stanley
had dressed quickly in silence and taken her departure with only a half-whispered "Good-afternoon"
to Ruth, "did you know that the girl you have been sitting next all day is the very one we
were talking about yesterday?"

"Yes, I imagined so," was the quiet reply.

"But I thought you knew that we had all determined to cut her if she came back, and not to
say one word more to her than we were really obliged," continued Julia.

"Why?" asked Ruth sharply.

"Because she has no business here, because she degrades the school. A bankrupt's daughter ought
not to come here," said Julia haughtily, "and I hope you will not associate with her."

Ruth's eyes were flashing and her cheeks crimson as she retorted angrily, "That is no reason
why I should not be friendly with her; and indeed, Julia, I do not intend to ask you whom I
am to choose for my friends."

"Do as you like, and go your own way," said Julia with a scornful laugh. "Mabel must be destitute
of all fine feeling, but perhaps you have a fancy for people of that sort. If any one belonging
to me had ever been a bankrupt, I should never show my face in the town again."

She left the house a moment later with one or two of her chosen friends, and Ruth was slowly
walking home alone, trying to swallow her indignation, and letting the cool breeze fan her
hot cheeks, when Ethel Thompson overtook her.

"I really think," she began, "that Julia has been terribly down on Mabel, and I am glad that
you took her part and would not give in. Our coolness to her to-day was all Julia's doing,
and I know that she is wild with you, for she cannot bear to be crossed. But Mabel has not
done anything; and after all, I don't see why we should cut her to please Julia, who wants
to dictate to every one."

Ruth made an indifferent reply, and hastened to change the subject, for she did not care to
discuss her cousin's shortcomings with one whom she knew but slightly.

Very few words passed between the cousins upon their return home that evening; but on their
way to school the next morning Julia asked scornfully, "Do you still intend to cultivate your
aristocratic acquaintance, Ruth?"

"I shall do as I please," said the other shortly.

The girls at Miss Elgin's were mostly the children of wealthy parents, but unhappily many of
them, though rich and fashionable, were sadly lacking in refinement of heart and mind. Money
was the god revered and worshipped in most of their homes, the one thing talked of and held
in honour, and it was not surprising that the girls, from constantly hearing their neighbours'
worth reckoned solely by the amount of money they possessed, had come to regard it as the chief
good, and to consider the want of it as something like a crime. Julia had been reared in a
somewhat different atmosphere, but she had adopted the tone of her school-fellows, and even
surpassed them in scorn and disdain for those who were poor or unfortunate.

But she was about to meet with a terrible humiliation.

CHAPTER XII.

JULIA'S HUMILIATION.

A tender conscience is easily aroused, and Ruth's had been troubling her since the previous
afternoon. She knew that although she had done right in befriending Mabel she had not done
it in a Christian spirit. She almost decided that she ought to beg her cousin's pardon, and
was even thinking what it would be advisable to say, when Julia's question stirred her worst
feelings to activity, and she answered curtly that she should do as she pleased.

A lively conversation was being carried on in the cloak-room, but suddenly ceased as they entered.
The exciting cause of it was Ethel Thompson, whose busy tongue often brought both herself and
others into trouble. She had carried home a full account of the quarrel between the cousins
the day before, and had concluded by imitating Julia's haughty manner when she said, "If any
one belonging to me had ever been a bankrupt, I should never show my face in the town again."

"Humph! Did she say that?" asked Mr. Thompson. "Well 'people who live in glass houses shouldn't
throw stones.'"

"Why do you say that?" inquired Ethel curiously.

"Because her own father failed some years ago."

"Are you quite sure?"

"Oh yes, I remember it very well, though I suppose it must have been quite nine or ten years
ago, time flies so fast. But he is a very prosperous man now."

Ethel did not wait to hear more, but went to school next day full of the idea of humbling Julia
by means of this wonderful piece of news. At this time the enemy had several very strong and heavily
wired redoubts in his front line, and of these, by far the most spectacular
was dug round a derelict tank of ours, lost in the second Gaza battle.

It was known to us as Tank Redoubt and lay opposite Abbas Apex in our own line and some 1600
yards away. Several very successful raids had been made on other of his strongholds and G.H.Q. detailed
our battalion for a similar attempt on Tank Redoubt. Such an operation required skilful and
exact preparation and very great accuracy.

A scale model of the redoubt was made near the bivouac area and the raiding party, 300 strong,
under Major Findlay, began active rehearsals. The "Destruction Party"
were to form a spectacular feature of this raid.

They were to carry 6-feet tubes full of ammonal for blowing gaps in the wire. The sappers,
by using the mechanism of Mill's bombs, were able to devise a method
by which the Mill's lever was released and five seconds after the
tubes exploded.

Hatchet men then were to rush in and clear the gaps.

The system seemed to work well in practice.

The raid was to take place while the Battalion was holding the line at Abbas Apex, and on August
5th Colonel Morrison with the rest of the Battalion took over this sector from the 4th R.S.
Previously, parties of officers and men from the raiding party had
gone out on patrol with the Royal Scots in order to familiarise themselves
with the ground.

On every occasion they met strong Turkish patrols, who usually held some old British trenches,
dug by the Suffolks during the second Gaza battle, on a small ridge
about 600 yards from Tank Redoubt, known as Suffolk Ridge.

The first officer we sent out to familiarise himself with the ground
had a much more exciting time than he bargained for, and only by being
possessed of an excellent sense of direction did he return to us.

It was a fitting introduction to what was in store for us in the
No-Man's Land in front of the Abbas Apex.

The presence of a hostile patrol on the night of the raid would jeopardise everything and so
it was determined to make an attempt to clear No Man's Land the night before. A patrol of
two officers and thirty other ranks accordingly got orders to move out to the old British trenches
to act as a decoy to entice the enemy to pursue them towards our
lines, while on the flank were to be stationed two companies of another
unit, whose orders were on hearing rapid fire coming from the patrol
to close with the bayonet on the flank of the enemy and roll up his
line against our wire.

It was an intensely dark night and the patrol moved out after the two companies were safely
hidden in cover. The first intimation of the Turk was the sight of a line of sparks from bombs
being lit (the Turk then used brassards for lighting the fuses); then began quite a battle.
Rifles and our Lewis guns opened out rapid fire, ceased fire, and
opened again, and then began to withdraw.

It was time, as the Turks were enveloping us. Several men had been hit and half the butt of the
Lewis gun blown off by a bomb. It was difficult to estimate the number of the enemy, but an officer
found himself in the third extended line of advancing Turks and reckoned we were up against a
big roving patrol which had a good reputation for this sort of work.

 "Then I can never go to
Miss Elgin's again."

She threw herself upon the sofa, and for some minutes was unable to speak, so violent was her
passion and anger. In vain her father demanded an explanation of her strange behaviour, and
her mother tried to calm and soothe her.

"Leave her to me," she said at last. "I am quite at a loss to understand the matter, but she
will tell me when she is better."

Before the sobs had altogether subsided Ruth entered the room: for Miss Elgin, hearing of Julia's
sudden departure, had imagined that her headache had increased, and at once despatched her
cousin to follow her.

"Perhaps you can explain what has happened," said her aunt. "Why have the girls been talking
of your uncle's business affairs?"

"Well, the fact is, auntie, that Mabel Stanley came to school yesterday, and Julia was cross
and rude to her because her father has failed, and then the girls made up this tale to humble
her, and she flew into a rage and came home."

"Now I understand. But the tale was true, nevertheless. Now, Julia dear, don't sob. I think
I had better tell you all about it, that you may understand for yourselves.

"I think you know, Julia, that when your father started in life he had not much capital, and
began business in a small way. But he did very well until there came a time of commercial depression,
and a man who owed him a considerable sum of money died insolvent. Then your father found that
he was so much embarrassed that he thought the wisest and most honourable course would be to
divide what he had amongst his creditors at once. He gave up everything to them, and was hesitating
what he should do for a living. Just at that time my father died and left all his little property
to me and my brother (your father, Ruth). My money would not have been sufficient to start
another business, but your father came to our help, and offered to lend his share of the money.
Then my husband was able to start again, and prospered. All his creditors were paid in full
long ago, and my brother's money was repaid with interest, though nothing, I am sure, can ever
repay his kindness in lending it to us at that particular time, for I fear that he must have
been straitened for years by his generous deed. Now you understand, Ruth, why I told you that
everything I gave you had been more than paid for long ago, though I did not know that it would
be necessary to tell you how."

Ruth was silent and thoughtful. Her aunt's words gave her the clue to many things which she
had never been able to comprehend. She guessed now why her father sometimes looked regretfully
at a large and excellent farm a short distance from his own.

"You ought to have taken that farm," she had once heard a neighbour remark to him.

"Ah! the time for that is gone by," was his reply.

She believed now that the opportunity of taking it had occurred while the money was embarked
in her uncle's business, and that when it was free the farm and the family had soon absorbed
it, for the land was not very good, and there had been several bad harvests lately.

"Why did you never tell me before?" asked Julia peevishly, from the sofa.

"Why, dear? Well, you know it is never pleasant to talk about our failures. Your father has
not referred to the subject, even to me, for years, and I could see that he was exceedingly
annoyed by your mention of it just now. You were but an infant at the time, and it is so long
ago that it seemed to have been forgotten. But I have looked back sometimes since we have grown
rich, and thought with pleasure of my brother's kindness."

"Still it is true," whined Julia, "and," she added passionately, "I can never look at Ethel
Thompson or any of the girls again."

"That is very silly," said her mother.

"Indeed I cannot--never--never, and I am the most wretched girl in England, and shall never
be happy again!"

Her sobs were renewed with redoubled violence, and she looked really ill from vexation and
passion. Mrs. Woburn gave her some cooling medicine and persuaded her to go to bed.

But Ruth did not pity her cousin. She worked alone at her lessons that evening, and when the
thought of Julia crossed her mind her lips tightened and she said to herself, "She deserves
to be ill. She treated Mabel unkindly, and now it has come back to her, and she is suffering
for it. Yes, she deserves it." And before she went to rest that night she read in her little
Bible a few verses about the sin of pride, with a mental reference to Julia, and also some
passages concerning retribution, and wrong-doing coming home to the sinner.

She was not following in the footsteps of the Lord, who hates sin, yet loves the sinner, but
thought only of her cousin's just punishment, and wondered how she would bear to meet all her
school-fellows again. She was not cherishing the love that vaunteth not itself, that is not
puffed up, that rejoiceth not in iniquity; the love that never faileth, and that covers a multitude
of sins.

Was there not something of the spirit of the Pharisee in Ruth's heart? Was she not beginning
to sit in the seat of the scornful, and to look down upon her cousin from her superior position?
Well, pride must have a fall, sooner or later, whether it be pride of position or pride of heart.

CHAPTER XIII.

HARD AT WORK.

Ruth went to school alone the next morning, for Julia was so unwell from the excitement of
the day that she seemed quite ill and feverish, and was scarcely able to lift her head from
the pillow. Her eyes had dark rims round them, her head ached terribly, and she was certainly
quite unfit to attend to her studies and to meet her school-fellows.

None of the girls liked to ask Ruth what had happened after her return home, and they scarcely
ventured to inquire for her cousin. They evidently felt that they had gone too far, and began
to speak kindly to Mabel and to treat her in their usual manner.

But the poor girl could not easily forget the slights she had received, and amid their new-born
kindness she turned naturally to the one who had befriended her while the others behaved rudely.
She soon grew quite intimate with Ruth, and even ventured to speak of the trouble which had
befallen her father that summer, and of her future prospects.

"Of course," she said, "papa would not have thought of allowing me to remain at such an expensive
school as Miss Elgin's, but grandmamma has kindly promised to pay the expenses of my education
for two years, and if I study hard for that time I hope that I shall be able to teach, and
to help papa and mamma."

Ruth could thoroughly sympathise with her friend, and entered into her feelings, her hopes
and aspirations, for was she not working with the same object in view? Did she not desire to
help her father and mother by teaching the younger children?

Thus their friendship grew and strengthened during Julia's absence, which lasted quite a week.

She, poor child, was quite unstrung, and for two or three days the very mention of school brought
on a fit of hysterical crying, and she begged that she might be allowed to go to some boarding-school
at a distance, anywhere--away from Busyborough. Mrs. Woburn was inclined to yield to her wish;
but her father would not hear of such a thing, and declared that she had brought all the trouble
upon herself by her own folly, and she must bear the consequences of it. He was, in fact, excessively
angry with his spoilt child, and believed that her return to school would be a severe punishment
which she richly deserved.

When Mr. Woburn spoke in that decided way there was nothing to be done but to obey. His wife,
however, called upon Miss Elgin, and explained the reason of Julia's absence, begging that
she would ask the girls to receive her kindly, without referring to the cause of the quarrel,
as she had already suffered a good deal.

Miss Elgin was astonished to hear of the affair, which had perplexed and puzzled her not a
little; for, as her pupils had all felt themselves more or less to blame in the matter, they
had all kept it from her knowledge, and she had only guessed from their reticence, and the
air of mystery with which they received every allusion to their absent school-fellow, that
something was wrong. Before morning school she called the girls together, told them how pained
and grieved she had been, and gave them a little lecture upon the duty of ruling the tongue,
and the folly of valuing people only for their wealth or position instead of their goodness
and virtue. The girls listened in silence, and when Julia returned, looking very much ashamed
and humbled after her vain boasting, they made no allusion to her fiery outburst, and in a
few days she had regained her old place in the school and everything went on as usual.

Lessons, classes, exercises, and lectures were crowded into each day. Ruth had plenty to do,
and found that she must work very hard if she wished to succeed, and to take a good place in
the school. She was astonished to see how indolent some of the girls were; to find that many
of them did not care for knowledge for its own sake, but regarded their lessons as a trouble,
and were continually begging to be allowed to leave off this or that study. And she was still
more surprised and shocked to find how many of the exercises were merely copied from old books,
with perhaps a few slight mistakes inserted to prevent suspicion. On more than one occasion,
Ruth gave offence by refusing to lend her books for this purpose, or to avail herself of proffered
assistance; but she persevered steadily, and declared that she would rather make a few mistakes
than evade a difficulty which she could not surmount, as she would be sure to meet it again.

Miss Elgin was not long in perceiving that Ruth was a conscientious girl, anxious to learn,
and in many little ways she contrived to help and encourage her.

As the weather grew colder and winter advanced, the old home-life at the farm seemed very far
away, and somehow the home letters were not so full of interest as they had once been. How
trivial and childish it seemed to read about the new kittens, the chickens, the nuts in the
woods, and the apples in the orchard, and the many little details with which the children's
letters were filled, when one was studying chemistry and reading Milton and Shakespeare. Her
mother's letters were always welcome, but they were very rare.

The comfort and luxury of her new home were beginning to make a visible alteration in her.
Already she looked and felt quite a different person from the little Ruth Arnold who sometimes
milked the cows, or helped with the house-work when the servants were busy. Her brown curls
had long since given place to a long plait like Julia's, her clothes were of richer materials
and made in a more fashionable style, and she had what seemed at first an abundant supply of
pocket-money. The only day on which she really longed to be back at Cressleigh was Sunday.
It had always been such a happy day at the farm, the only rest day of the busy father and mother,
and always spent with the children. There were of course certain duties which could not be
neglected, but these were quickly done, and then the whole family went together to the house
of God. In the afternoon the children all went to Sunday-school, where Will was promoted to
the post of teacher, and Mr. and Mrs. Arnold had a quiet hour together with no one but the
baby to disturb them. There was rarely any service in the evening, but it was a pleasant time
for the children, who in fine summer weather sat on the lawn and sang their favourite hymns,
or on winter evenings gathered round the old piano in the well-worn parlour while their mother
or Ruth played, or listened while their father talked or read some good and interesting book.
All went to bed early, and rose in the morning refreshed and strengthened by the joy and repose
of the day of rest.

But Sunday at Busyborough was quite a different matter. Every one was expected to attend public
worship once during the day, but Gerald was often missing, and the others did not appear to
take much pleasure in going. Mr. Woburn had a pew in a handsome church close by, and also at
a large Nonconformist chapel in the neighbourhood. His wife usually attended the latter, but
Julia preferred the church, where the service was very elaborate. She hated long sermons, she
said, and liked to have something to look at. Ruth accompanied her once or twice, but found
the morning service, to which she had been accustomed all her life, so differently rendered
that at first she could hardly follow it. The dear old Psalms, which had always been read at
Cressleigh by the clergyman and the people led by the parish clerk, sounded so strange and
unfamiliar when chanted by a surpliced choir. The intoning, the processions, and everything
else, were so strange, that Ruth was afraid to join in the service.

After going a few times she decided to accompany her aunt, for although the service of the
chapel was unfamiliar she was able to enter into the spirit of it, and could appreciate and
enjoy the sermon delivered by a clever and eloquent preacher.

The family dined early on Sundays, and then the miserable part of the day began for Ruth. There
was "nothing to do on Sundays," Julia said, and indeed there seemed to be no occupation provided.
No one thought of going to Sunday-school, as Ruth had once timidly suggested, although Julia
sometimes went to church when there was a special musical service. At other times she would
begin to read; then she would fidget or strum on the piano, greatly to the annoyance of her
father, who always took a Sunday afternoon nap, and of Ernest, who buried himself in a book.
Gerald went out, Rupert got into all sorts of mischief, and Ruth was left to her own devices.

In the evening the girls wrote their Scripture exercises, under cover of which Julia often
did other lessons, though this was quite contrary to the express orders of her father, who
was very anxious that his children should have a "proper regard for the day." There was continual
bickering, many disputes and petty quarrels, and when bed-time came every one was weary and
cross, and seemed glad the day was over. No wonder that Ruth often longed and sighed for one
of the happy old Sundays at home.

CHAPTER XIV.

AN ADVENTURE.

Gerald was less known to his cousin than any other member of the family, for he spent very
little time in her society. He usually rose late, and after a hasty breakfast hurried away
to the office whither his father had already gone. The girls did not see him again until six
o'clock when he returned to dinner, frequently going out directly it was over to spend the
evening with his friends.

Yet, although Ruth saw but little of him, that little astonished her. She could never forget
that he was only a year or two older than Will. A year or two made a great difference, she
knew, but could Will ever become such a well-dressed fashionable young man, who grumbled at
his mother if the dinner was not to his mind, scolded the servants, and argued and talked to
his father just as if he were a man of his own age?

Ruth thought not, and hoped not.

The short November days were cold and dreary, school duties seemed to increase, and the girls
were beginning to talk of the coming examinations, and to look forward to the Christmas holidays
and festivities.

In spite of hard work Ruth found it a difficult matter to do all her lessons thoroughly, and
although she was strong and healthy and not easily fatigued, the effort was beginning to tell
upon her.

One fine Wednesday her aunt persuaded her to take a holiday. The rest was very pleasant, but
she had a certain amount of work to finish by the end of the week, and sat up rather late the
next night over her French translation. She was obliged to give up at last, and went to bed
quite dissatisfied with her evening's work. But when she laid her head upon the pillow sleep
quite forsook her. She tossed and turned, but all in vain, sleep would not come; her mind was
full of the paragraph she had been endeavouring to translate, and she felt sure that she could
do it much better, if only it were not so late.

Might she not scribble down a few of the sentences which had puzzled her, but were now quite
clear? Of course her aunt would not like it, but then she need never know. It could not be
any worse to write than to lie in bed and think, she argued, and it would be such a relief
to get it done.

She sprang out of bed, turned up the gas, put on her pretty flannel dressing gown and woollen
shoes, drew up a comfortable easy-chair, and then remembered that she had left all her books
and papers downstairs, in the little room opening out of the hall where she and Julia prepared
their lessons.

"Never mind, I can get it without disturbing any one," she said, as she lighted a bedroom candle
and crept downstairs very softly in her woollen shoes, shading the candle as she passed the
bedroom doors that the light might not be seen.

The house was very still and quiet: not a sound was to be heard but the ticking of the great
clock in the hall. Ruth did not look at it, she did not care to know the time, for she was
sure it was very late. The little study looked cold and desolate by the light of her solitary
candle, and the ashes in the grate still moved and made a slight rustling which sounded very
plainly. Ruth had just gathered up her books and papers when the hall clock struck close to
her, one long solemn stroke.

One o'clock! It was very late she owned, and very lonely down there.

Hark! what was that? Surely the clock was striking again. No, it was a different sound and
came from the front-door. Some person was evidently trying to open it. Ruth's heart stood still.
All the terrible stories she had ever heard of burglars and midnight robberies came to her
mind, and at the same time the unpleasant conviction that she had stepped aside from the path
of duty and thus brought herself into danger.

Her presence of mind was quite gone. She feared that her candle might attract attention, but
dared not extinguish it and be alone in the dark with--she knew not whom. Holding her breath
she stood for a moment gazing fixedly towards the door. It was opened softly and cautiously,
and the figure of a man entered the hall and carefully fastened the bolts of the door. Ruth
was too terrified to scream, and as the light of her candle fell upon his face she suddenly
recognised her cousin--Gerald.

He started when he saw the light and his little cousin's scared pale face, and exclaimed, "What
is the matter, Ruth?"

"Oh, Gerald, how you have frightened me!" she said, trembling violently. "Where have you been?"

"What are you doing here?" he asked, evading her question.

"I couldn't sleep, and came down to fetch my books, and I--I heard you at the door, and thought
you were a burglar."

"Do you often stroll about at night?" he inquired curiously.

"No, indeed. And I have been so terrified that I am sure I will never do it again. I am very
sorry, but I will tell auntie all about it to-morrow," she said, taking her candle and moving
towards the stairs.

"Ruth," said Gerald, in an agitated whisper, "wait a minute."

She turned so that the light fell full upon his face, and saw that he looked white and anxious.

"May I ask you, as a favour, not to mention your adventure with the burglar? Perhaps it would
be better for both of us to be silent about to-night's occurrence."

"Why? Where have you been, Gerald? You went to bed before ten o'clock, and"--a thought struck
her--"how came the door to be unbolted?"

"Now, Ruth," he said coaxingly, "I know you are a good-natured little thing, and I don't believe
you would do me a bad turn. You know the governor is always down upon me, won't let me have
a latch-key, and says I must be in by half-past ten. A fellow can't live without a little pleasure,
and if the governor won't let me have it I must take it. But don't say a word, there's a dear,
or you will get me into an awful row."

"But it is so wrong to deceive your father and mother," urged Ruth, thinking that after all
Gerald was not so "grown-up" as he seemed. "Do you often go out at night?"

"No, very seldom."

It was not true, but he was anxious to conciliate her.

"Well, Ruth, shall we promise each other that we won't say a word about to-night?"

"I don't know. I don't mind telling auntie what I have done, though I know it was wrong and
foolish, but, of course, I don't want to get you into trouble. Yet--I can't tell lies----"

"Of course not; I wouldn't wish it. But you can be silent--yes, I believe you can--and I want
you to promise me on your word as a good little cousin, that you will not mention what has
happened to any one."

"Very well," she said, turning away slowly.

"Gerald, will you promise me something?"

"Anything you like."

They were almost upstairs now, and he was anxious for her to be silent.

"Promise that you won't go out at night again without letting your father know."

"I'll promise," was his whispered reply; and they separated.

Another moment, and Ruth was in her own room, but without the books for which she had gone
downstairs. She had forgotten them and the translation in her astonishment about Gerald, and
when she lay in bed once more her mind was full of her strange adventure, and she began to
wonder if she had done right in giving her promise so quickly, without any reflection.

A promise was to her a sacred thing, not to be lightly given or easily broken, but she comforted
herself with the thought that she was really doing good to her cousin. Had he not promised
her in return that he would give up these forbidden pleasures? And was not that something to
rejoice over?

She did not know enough of the world to reflect that one who wilfully deceived his parents
was hardly likely to keep a promise so readily made to his little country cousin.

CHAPTER XV.

EXAMINATION.

After the events of that night Gerald took more notice of Ruth, spoke kindly to her, and often
remarked upon her studious industry, usually to his sister's disparagement. Although she was
not very fond of Julia, Ruth could not help feeling that this must be very galling to her,
for Julia certainly seemed more fond of Gerald than of any other person, and she felt his sarcastic
remarks very keenly.

He appeared to be keeping his promise, for he came down to breakfast in good time and did not
look so pale and languid as usual. But Ruth soon forgot both Gerald and her promise for a time
in a matter of great importance to herself--the school examination.

She had been working steadily throughout the term, and was very anxious to pass the examination
creditably, more especially as, in addition to the usual prizes, Miss Elgin had offered one
for general improvement, which she was very desirous of obtaining. It would, she knew, be such
a joy to her father and mother, who were expecting great things of her, and their pride and
approval would be more to her than the honour of receiving the prize.

In English studies Ruth had made very considerable progress, and did not much fear the result
of the examination, but she was not so sure about French. That was always her weak point, perhaps
on account of the very English fashion in which she had learnt it at Miss Green's. Still she
persevered with it, and had some hopes of success.

But when the hour of the examination came, and the papers were given out, her courage almost
failed.

There were grammatical questions, phrases to be explained, and short sentences to be translated
into French. These she understood fairly, but the paragraph that filled her with dismay was
a short French poem of three verses to be put into English prose. She read it again and again,
but, from the idioms and inversions it contained, totally failed to comprehend its meaning.
Indeed, she could see from the significant glances which--talking being forbidden--were exchanged
between the girls, that she was not the only one who failed to appreciate the beauty, or even
the sense of the poem.

"It's of no use," she sighed; "I must leave it and answer some questions. If I have time afterwards,
I may, perhaps, do one verse."

For a whole hour there was not a sound to be heard but the scratching of busy pens and the
rustling of papers or the tapping of idle fingers, waiting to put down the thoughts that would
not come.

Julia was writing very fast. She was more proficient in French than in any other study. She
liked it, and easily caught the sounds, and was very proud of the fact that she had once spent
a few days in Paris with her mother. She had also profited by her friendship with a French
girl, one of Miss Elgin's boarders, who had come to the place quite unable to speak English.
Julia had taken a fancy to mademoiselle, and in conversation with her picked up several unusual
phrases, and became familiar with many of the idioms, though her knowledge of the grammar was
still very meagre.

The poem which perplexed the other girls was less difficult to her than the grammatical questions,
and she wrote away busily translating it. She was seated at a desk just in front of Ruth, who
looked up after writing her answers, wondering what she could do about the poem. The time allowed
for the paper was drawing to a close. Julia had finished her translation, and was holding it
in her hand, reading it over to see if it required any correction. Her writing was large, firm,
and clear, and as she held up the paper Ruth's eye fell upon it, and, almost unconsciously,
she read the whole of her cousin's translation.

The meaning of the poem was no longer a mystery to her. She understood it now, and could easily
translate it.

Without stopping to think if it were right or wrong, she seized her pen and wrote the words
as they came to her mind. Naturally enough they were almost identical with those she had read
on her cousin's paper. But she did not stop to think, and had scarcely finished the last word
when the clock struck, and the papers were immediately collected, Ruth's not having been even
read over.

"How many questions did you answer?" "What have you done?" "How did you get on with that dreadful
translation?" asked the girls of each other when school hours were over and their tongues were
once more unloosed.

"I suppose that you have done it, Julia, you are so clever at French," said Ethel.

"It really wasn't difficult," replied Julia carelessly. "What have you done, Ruth?"

"I think I answered nearly all the questions," was the reply.

"And the poem?"

"Yes, I did it."

Julia looked rather surprised, but she said nothing, though several of the girls were loud
in their exclamations of wonder that Ruth should even have attempted it.

She listened rather impatiently to their remarks, for already she felt ashamed of the advantage
she had taken, and would gladly have seized the paper upon which her translation was written
and thrown it upon the fire.

But it had gone out of her possession and was hers no longer.

CHAPTER XVI.

A DOWNWARD STEP.

"I can't think what has happened to Ruth, she is not at all like her usual self," remarked
Ernest that evening.

He had been playfully teasing his cousin about her studies, when she suddenly answered him
sharply, burst into a violent flood of tears, and ran away to her own room.

"She is crosser than ever," said Julia.

"Poor child!" sighed Mrs. Woburn; "I am afraid she has been working too hard. I am glad for
her sake that the holidays are so near. She is so anxious to do well, and to-day's examination
has tried her sadly."

Meanwhile Ruth, upstairs in her own room, was sobbing bitterly, and thinking hard thoughts
of herself. The examination had tried her, but not half as much as the loss of self-respect
she had felt since she gave up her papers that morning with the translation which was certainly
not the result of her own work.

"I wish I had never left home," she thought; "everything is going wrong, it is so difficult
to do right here. If only I had not seen Julia's translation. If I had never promised Gerald
that I would not mention about his coming in so late. Oh, I wish I were back at Cressleigh!"

With the thought of home, which to her troubled mind seemed so calm and peaceful, came the
remembrance of her mother's words, "I should have no fear for you if I were sure that you were
not going alone, if I knew that you had an almighty Friend with you to lead you in the right way."

She knew that she had strayed out of the right way, and she had not far to seek for the reason.
Ever since she came to Busyborough she had been growing careless about the things of eternity,
and had ceased to take delight in reading God's Word and in prayer.

The Bible upon her dressing-table was read daily, it is true, and both morning and evening
Ruth knelt for a few moments in prayer. But the sweet meaning was gone from the texts, and
the prayer was little better than a form; there was no life in either.

When the young girl went to live at her uncle's house, she found that the lives of those with
whom she came into daily contact were not ruled by the same principles and motives as her own.
At first she grieved and prayed for her cousins, then she became self-sufficient and wise in
her own conceit; and having once allowed the unchristian spirit of pride and dislike for Julia
to creep into her heart and take possession, other evils had quickly followed, and had gradually
drawn her farther and farther away from her Saviour. She began to see it all that night, and
to realize how far off she was; but the knowledge only increased her wretchedness, and made
her more miserable. Suddenly a thought struck her. Would it not be wise and right to go to
Miss Elgin before school the next morning, to confess that she had yielded to temptation, and
to ask that the obnoxious translation might at once be burnt?

But Ruth angrily resisted the notion. Confess that she, who bore the character of the most
conscientious and trustworthy girl in the school, had stooped to do the very thing which she
had so often censured in others? No, never. It would be too degrading and humiliating. Perhaps,
after all, Julia's translation was not correct. There might be many faults in her own, and
it was very unlikely that she would get a high number of marks for her French paper.

Thus she tried to quiet her conscience, and to banish uncomfortable suggestions. It was the
22nd of December, and the prizes were to be given away on the 23rd. It was not yet known who
were to receive them, and, as school work was virtually over, there was a good deal of talk
and speculation concerning them. Finishing touches were being given to drawings and maps, desks
were being put in order, and books arranged, all in preparation for the festive morrow.

"Miss Arnold, will you go at once to Miss Elgin, in the library?" said one of the teachers
in charge of the restless chattering crowd of girls.

Ruth obeyed, and left the room with a heightened colour, and the girls began to wonder why
she had been summoned.

"It is about the prize for general improvement, I believe," said Ethel Thompson. "I heard Miss
Elgin telling Miss Lee that she thought Ruth deserved it for 'her steady and conscientious work.'"

"Well, there is no doubt that she has worked hard," said one of her companions.

"Come in," said Miss Elgin, in response to Ruth's tap at the library door. "Sit down, dear;
I want to ask you a question."

The governess was seated in her study chair, looking over the piles of examination papers heaped
upon the table, and entering the numbers of marks in a small red book.

"I want to ask you a question," she repeated. "Did any one help you with your French paper?"

Ruth was taken aback. She did not wish to tell a falsehood, and yet she felt that she could
not, could not confess now. Her face grew crimson, and a crowd of thoughts surged through her
brain. The form in which the question was put tempted her, and she argued with herself, "No
one helped me. How could Julia help me without knowing? I helped myself." And after a moment's
pause, in which she seemed to be listening for her own reply, her lips moved and repeated the
expression of her thoughts, "No--no one helped me."

"Excuse my asking you, but your paper was so remarkably good that I could hardly understand
your having so few faults, especially in the translation, which was really difficult. I suppose,"
she added with a smile, "that you have already concluded that your steady application and diligent
work will meet with their deserved reward. That will do. You may go now."

She returned to the schoolroom in silence, her mind full of two ideas: the first, that she
had obtained the prize; the second, that she had deceived Miss Elgin.

"But I have not told an untruth," she argued with her conscience. "I was asked if any one helped
me. Julia did not help me. I only saw and read her paper accidentally."

It was very trying work, arguing with conscience when a number of chattering girls were buzzing
about, laughing and asking questions, and Ruth gave several sharp and pettish replies to their
inquiries, and was rallied upon her silence and her grave face.

How often it happens that our hardest battles have to be fought in the midst of a crowd, that
our moments of sharpest agony and keenest remorse come at a time when we long for solitude,
but cannot obtain it, but must go on speaking and acting as if our minds were quite at ease,
and full of nothing but the trifling affairs of the moment.

Ruth's conscience was very active, and would keep reminding her that it was not yet too late
to go and confess to Miss Elgin. But she put it off. Alas! every moment that had elapsed since
she gave up the paper rendered such a task more difficult; the longer she concealed her fault
the more serious it became. Looking quite pale and wretched, she returned home that afternoon
with a splitting headache. Her aunt was quite troubled about her, though she tried to make
light of it, and Mr. Woburn said cheerily, "You must make haste and get well for to-morrow,
Ruth. I suppose you will have a grand prize to bring home after all this term's work."

"Indeed, I would rather not go to-morrow morning," she replied sincerely, as she wished them
good-night.

CHAPTER XVII.

THE PRIZE.

But when the morning came she could find no plausible excuse for absenting herself from the
prize-giving. Her head was better, though she still looked pale, and Mrs. Woburn, who was to
accompany the two girls, would not hear of her remaining at home.

Sick at heart, and anxious for the whole business to be over, Ruth followed her aunt and cousin
into the schoolroom, where the desks had been cleared away, and the drawings and work of the
pupils were arranged for exhibition.

A number of visitors had already arrived, and were walking round inspecting the drawings, etc.,
and chatting in little groups, until Mr. Redcliffe, a gentleman of influence and wide repute,
entered the schoolroom and took his seat. He made a little speech upon the value of education,
complimented Miss Elgin upon her excellent system of instruction and the proficiency of her
pupils, and said a few words of congratulation and encouragement to each of the girls as they
came forward to receive their prizes.

Ruth's turn came last, and perhaps on that account his words to her were even kinder and more
appreciative. He considered that the prize for general improvement was perhaps better worth
having than any other, because, in order to gain it, one must indeed have proved worthy, he
said to the blushing girl who stood before him, trembling and full of shame, which, however,
appeared to be humility.

The longed-for moment had come at last, and Ruth held in her hand the prize for which she had
worked and striven. Yes, she had gained it, but at what a cost!

At the cost of truth and honour, of right principle and self-respect. It was a very poor exchange
for them, and the unhappy girl would gladly have given it up, would have borne any disappointment,
anything but the humiliation of confession, to have been her old light-hearted innocent self
again. But she had done wrong, and although she shrank from pain, she had to bear what, in
her state of mind, was indeed a trial--the kind congratulations of her school-fellows, and
the praises of her teacher and friends. Even when she reached home the trial was not over,
for her uncle and cousins had each some kind word to say.

"And now, my dear, you must write to your father and mother," said Mrs. Woburn that afternoon.
"How proud and delighted they will be to hear of your success!"

That letter! It was the hardest task of all to write and tell her parents what she knew would
give them so much pleasure, while she was concealing the fact which would, if known, give them
far greater pain. She spent the afternoon writing and re-writing it, and at last sent off a
stiff, constrained little note, informing them that she had been successful, and hoped they
were all well.

When Mrs. Arnold received the letter, she read it again and again. She felt convinced, from
the absence of any playful remarks, from Ruth's unusual brevity and lack of detail, that something
was wrong; but she knew that if her daughter did not write freely she could not force her confidence.
So she carried the trouble to her Heavenly Father, and asked Him to lead and guide her absent
child.

Christmas was upon them almost before Ruth was aware of it, the gayest and most festive Christmas
time that she had ever known, a round of parties, pleasure and merriment. It needs a mind at
peace to be able to enter into and enjoy the innocent pleasures of life, and to feel no bitterness
when they are past. And Ruth, in spite of the presents she received, the parties to which she
was invited, and the pretty dresses she wore, was troubled in mind, and therefore unhappy.

Two things weighed heavily upon her, her own deceit, and her promise to Gerald.

She had been so carefully trained, and so early taught the difference between right and wrong,
that she could not look upon her prize without being reminded of the temptation to which she
had so suddenly yielded, and the equivocation to which she had resorted in order to hide it.

Then her promise to Gerald troubled her greatly. She felt almost sure, though she could not
prove it, that he was not keeping his word. He came down in the morning very late, looking
pale and haggard, scarcely tasted his breakfast, and hurried away to the office; and when he
returned in the evening either pooh-poohed his mother's anxious inquiries about his health,
or answered her curtly and snappishly.

Everything was going wrong, Ruth said to herself continually.

She had done very wrong, had taken a false step, and she felt truly enough that no power on
earth could alter that fact. And having once started on a downward path it seemed of no use
to try to stop and to do better in future: she must give up all her struggles to do right,
and go down, down. It requires a very hardened sinner to forget the past, and begin again as
if nothing had happened; or a very humble Christian to start again, after repeated failures,
in dependence upon God. Ruth's self-sufficiency was gone, and she sadly admitted to herself
that she was no better than Julia and the other girls. She had given up reading her Bible now,
thinking its sweet messages were not for her, a wayward, erring one, and would scarcely dare
to pray even for the safety and well-being of the dear ones at home. Too broken-spirited to
make resolutions which she felt herself to be too weak to carry out, afraid to open her Bible
and read therein her own condemnation, and feeling that her sin had raised a barrier, which
she was unable to remove, between herself and God, the New Year began in sorrow and sadness.
"Your sins have separated between you and your God." These words were continually in her mind,
and the remembrance of the peace and joy which she had once felt in thinking of the things
belonging to the kingdom only made her more miserable.

CHAPTER XVIII.

SO AS BY FIRE.

"Hark! what was that?" exclaimed Ruth one night, starting up in bed.

She had been half-dozing, half-dreaming, when she was startled by a slight noise downstairs,
as if something had fallen.

"I believe it is Gerald. I will go down at once, and tell him that as he has not kept his word
I am no longer bound by my promise."

She sprang out of bed, slipped on her dressing-gown and shoes, and hurried downstairs, anxious
to meet her cousin before he went up to his room, and to get rid of the embargo which rested
so heavily upon her.

Down the stairs and into the hall she went without meeting him. The front-door was fastened
and bolted securely. Had she been mistaken, or had he already gone to his room?

One moment she stood in perplexity and doubt. Then hearing a slight noise, and seeing a bright
light shining under the door of the little study, she turned the handle and opened the door
to enter, but stepped back, half-blinded by the cloud of smoke which immediately enveloped
her. The next moment she discovered the form of Gerald, who was evidently asleep in his chair,
bending over the table, upon which were some blazing papers. The table itself was on fire,
and the cloth that covered it was smouldering and giving forth volumes of smoke.

Ruth gave a piercing scream, which alarmed the household, rushed into the room, caught up the
heavy rug and threw it over the table, seized her cousin by the arm, and tried with all her
might to drag him from the room.

Before she succeeded in arousing him her aunt and uncle came to her relief, drawn thither by
her cry of alarm. They were soon followed by the terrified servants, who, under Mr. Woburn's
direction, quickly extinguished the fire and removed Gerald.

The young man was soon restored to consciousness, and started up with a bewildered look, but
his face assumed an expression of fear and horror as he gradually realized how narrowly he
had escaped from a dreadful death.

"Oh, Gerald! How did it occur?" asked his mother, giving utterance to the question which had
been uppermost in the minds of all.

"Don't ask," he almost groaned; "and yet you must know it, sooner or later."

"Do tell everything, Gerald," implored Ruth, who, now that the terror and excitement were over,
stood pale and shivering. "It was partly my fault, you know; I ought not to have made that
promise."

Thus entreated, Gerald told them the story of his faults and follies; of his midnight carousals
and their discovery by Ruth, of his overwhelming love of pleasure, of half-hours stolen from
the office during his father's absence and of work neglected. He went on to say that the chief
clerk had told him, a few days before, that he really must inform Mr. Woburn how shamefully
neglected were the books under his son's care; that he dreaded his father's anger, and promised
to write up the books and finish his work before the end of January. For this purpose he had
brought home the books and worked at them stealthily by night until drowsiness overtook him,
and he probably knocked over the candle which had done the mischief.

Mr. Woburn felt more anger than he dared to show at such a time, just after his son's deliverance
from a horrible fate, and he turned the subject by applauding Ruth's presence of mind and bravery.

"Don't praise me, I can't bear it! I am as bad as Gerald!" she sobbed, and rushed away to her
own room.

Before daylight the next morning Mrs. Woburn was at her door with a steaming cup of coffee.

"Drink this, my dear," she said. "How your hand trembles! I was afraid that you would feel
ill after your dreadful fright. Indeed, dear," she said, her eyes full of tears, "I can never
thank you, never feel half grateful enough for your brave rescue of my poor Gerald."

"Don't say that, auntie. If--if anything had happened, it would have been my fault. I ought
to have told you of his wrong-doing long ago."

"It was only your goodness of heart, darling," said her aunt kindly.

"But it wasn't right, auntie. I deceived you. Oh dear! I feel such a bundle of deceit. I've
deceived every one," she said under a sudden impulse. "No, don't stop me; I must tell you all
about it."

Then she poured into her ear the whole story of the prize as well as her promise to Gerald,
and finished by saying that she had been perfectly miserable all through the holidays.

Mrs. Woburn was surprised and somewhat shocked at this recital; but she was good-natured, and
her sense of wrong had been growing dull so many years that she failed to understand Ruth's
emotion.

"Poor child!" she said gently, "it has been very bad for you, but it is all over now, and you
will do better in future."

"Oh, auntie, how can I?" she exclaimed, as she thought what a different reply her mother would
have made.

"I must tell Miss Elgin," she said resolutely; "and I suppose all the girls must know, and
Julia, and--and father and mother."

"Do you think that necessary, dear? You are very sorry, I am sure. Is not that enough?"

"Nothing can make it right, I know, auntie; but I cannot, and will not, deceive them any longer."

Ruth burst into a fit of hysterical crying, and was only quieted by her aunt's promise to go
with her that very day to call upon Miss Elgin.

"Poor Ruth seems quite ill," said Mrs. Woburn at breakfast-time. "I persuaded her to stay in
bed a little while, and I think she will be better soon. She has made quite a confession to me."

"What was it about?" inquired Julia.

Then, according to her niece's wish, she repeated the whole story, concluding with the remark
that, after all, it was not quite such a serious matter as the poor child seemed to think.
She remembered that girls used to copy when she went to school, and they worked so hard now
that it really was somewhat excusable.

"You would think it was serious if you heard Ruth denounce it," was Julia's reply. "She could
never say enough against it, and pretended to be so much better than any of us. To think of
her having looked over me! I couldn't have believed it!"

Ernest made no remark, though he listened attentively to the conversation.

The visit to Miss Elgin, which Mrs. Woburn did not consider necessary, was a very trying ordeal.
She certainly did not make light of the matter, although she did not think it would be advisable
to tell the girls; it would be sufficient for them to know that Ruth was under her displeasure.

"I feared at first that there was something wrong," she said, "but I could not doubt your word,
Ruth; I have always trusted to your high principle and honour. Henceforth I must act differently,
and you must not expect to be trusted."

There was no palliation of the offence, which she surveyed from her high stand-point of justice
alone.

"Now, Ruth, your troubles are over," said her aunt gaily as they returned home.

"Over! Are they?" she sighed wearily to herself, "when I have to write home, and to live next
term under Miss Elgin's displeasure, and all my life with the remembrance of this behind me!"

It was a great trial to have to write home to dispel her mother's fond hopes and her father's
pride in her; to tell them that their Ruth was not the frank, open, truth-loving girl they
had always believed her; to prove to them that one of their children could stoop to equivocation
and deceit. Yes, it was a hard and bitter task, and she shed a good many tears over it as she
wrote, almost oblivious of everything else in the little study, where the traces of the fire
still remained.

Presently she raised her head, and saw Ernest looking at her--not curiously, but with a kind,
compassionate gaze.

"Ruth," he said, in a low tone, "I am awfully sorry for you, but I can't understand why you
should be so unhappy now."

"I shall always be wretched," said Ruth bitterly; "all my life, I expect."

"I--I thought when first you came here that you were a Christian," said the boy timidly.

"I thought so too," sobbed Ruth, "but I suppose I was wrong. Everything goes wrong here, and
that happy time is so far away."

"But if you have confessed to God, and have His forgiveness, the happiness will come again."

"Confess to Him? How could I? He is such a long way off now, and there is such a gulf between
that I cannot pray to Him."

"Oh, Ruth; you are making a great mistake. You know that Jesus died on purpose to put away
sin, to break down the wall, to bridge over the gulf. He is the same yesterday, to-day, and
for ever. It is you that have changed, not Christ. Go to Him at once; it is of no use humbling
yourself and confessing to others if you stop away from Him. He only can forgive and send peace."

"'Your sins have separated between you and your God,'" said Ruth solemnly.

"'The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin,'" replied her cousin.

"Ernest, you are a Christian!" said Ruth suddenly.

"Yes, I hope so," replied the boy, reddening as his shyness and self-consciousness returned. 

CHAPTER X

SECOND BATTLE OF GAZA.

If the first battle of Gaza was a legitimate gamble--the second was
foredoomed to failure from the start.

Given fair warning and three weeks in which to strengthen their position--and
probably no army in the world can beat the Turks at spade work--given
moreover a natural stronghold, reinforcements and innumerable machine-guns,
the enemy could certainly withstand a frontal assault by the same
troops as he had already beaten off in a surprise attack, strengthened
only by one newly formed Division, while the great prolongation of
the Turkish line to the west made any turning movement out of the
question.

Our artillery was utterly insufficient to deal with carefully constructed trenches among cactus
hedges, more terrible than barbed wire, of whose positions they were
not really certain, while our two trump cards, tanks and gas shell,
were certainly not sufficient to make up for other defects and to
win us the game.

Still all this is of course mere wisdom after the event. We certainly did not believe ourselves
preparing for a forlorn hope and we went into the second battle in
perfect confidence that we should be bivouacked among the Gaza olive
trees at its close.

There was, however, a good deal to be done first. On March 29th we rested, and a welcome shift
in the direction of the wind helped us to get even with our thirst. The next day a supply of gas masks
arrived, of the old appalling flannel kind, which went all over the head, and their mysteries
were explained to us by Lieut. Gray, assisted by private instruction
from those who had served in France.

     On the 31st the Battalion moved to a new bivouac area closer to the
wadi, screened from prying eyes at Gaza by a gentle rise in the ground.

     Rations were a bit thin at this time, with the railhead so far behind
us and so large a force to be fed, but the situation was greatly eased
by the fact that we could now employ wheeled transport with little
difficulty.

     The men were kept well employed.

We had to supply parties of 300, 500 and finally 600 for work in
the wadi under R.E. direction, or to act as covering parties for such
work.

The former consisted either in cutting ramps to enable traffic to
get down the precipitous banks or in digging wells in the wadi bottom.

 There was a great deal of talk for a few days, and then the
matter was forgotten by all but Miss Elgin, whose manner was a constant reminder of the affair.

As for Ruth herself, she could almost say, "None of these things move me," so trivial did they
seem; for she was rejoicing in the consciousness of forgiveness and pardon, her heart was resting
after its wanderings, filled with the "peace which passeth all understanding." The sheep had
come back to the fold, there to abide, to find its shelter safer and sweeter than ever.

Mrs. Arnold's reply to her daughter was at once tender, sorrowful, hopeful and motherly. She
grieved over what had happened, but rejoiced that her child had no longer any secret to hide
from her; she pointed out the only path of safety, and commended her to the care and keeping
of the loving Father who had watched over her during all her waywardness and had brought her
back to Himself.

That letter aroused an intense longing for home, for a glimpse of all the dear faces which
she had not seen for seven long months. August seemed so far away, though each day brought
it nearer. Ernest had quite relapsed into his usual shy, quiet manner, and it was only occasionally
that he was willing to talk with his cousin upon the one subject which was a bond of union
between them.

A change took place in the household early in March, for Gerald left home. His accident and
subsequent explanations opened his father's eyes to shortcomings which he had for some time
suspected, yet it was also the means of establishing a better relation between them.

The injury which the fire had caused to the books was a most serious matter, and not even several
weeks' work was able to repair the mischief. The whole matter was necessarily known to all
the clerks, and Mr. Woburn decided that his son must no longer remain in his office, where
he had been able persistently to shirk his duties. Gerald was thankful to have a chance of
starting afresh, away from his old associates, and gladly fell in with his father's proposal
that he should leave Busyborough, and take a situation which was easily procured for him in
another town.

Julia openly lamented his going, and also cried over it a good deal in secret, for she was
very much attached to her eldest brother, and had regarded Ruth far more kindly ever since
the night when she had been the means of saving him.

"I used to think that you hated Gerald," she said to her cousin one day, "and he seemed so
kind and polite to you, and so cross to me, that I grew jealous and couldn't bear you;" and
Ruth was somewhat amused to overhear Julia remark to a friend that she thought she (Ruth) "had
really improved of late."

Study, lessons, classes, essays, and practice were again the important matters to which attention
was directed daily, and there was little time for recreation or amusement until Easter, when
Gerald returned for a few days, and there was a fortnight's respite from the apparently endless
round of school duties.

A day's excursion of about ten miles into the country, in search of primroses and other wild
flowers, greatly revived Ruth's longing for home. It seemed so strange to think that the Cressleigh
woods were studded with primroses and anemones, and that she would not gather them nor see
the woods until the flowers had all vanished.

One more term's work, and then--hurrah for home! Such were her thoughts when she returned to
school again after her brief holiday; and as it would probably be her last term, she determined
to work with redoubled vigour and energy to acquire the knowledge which she would afterwards
be able to impart to her young brothers and sisters.

Miss Elgin's coolness and distrust considerably abated, when she saw Ruth working diligently
and bearing with patience the petty taunts and slights of her school-fellows. Her influence
was greater than it had been. She no longer found fault with the other girls in the spirit
of the Pharisee, but spoke compassionately, knowing what it was to be tempted and to fall,
and her companions were more inclined to follow the example of one who was striving to do right
than to be influenced by the precepts of a self-sufficient paragon.

There were still many slips and shortcomings, but she neither concealed nor made light of them;
she simply confessed herself in the wrong and began again in the strength which comes from above.

So the term passed, and Ruth, who believed that her school-days were nearly over, began to
take a mournful pleasure in thinking, "This is the last time I shall ever do this or that,"
and drew many plans for her future life.

Miss Elgin said that it was a pity for her to leave school when she was learning so much and
making such satisfactory progress; but Ruth somewhat propitiated her by saying that she would
work hard and keep up her studies at home.

But how little we know what the future will bring!

Just before the holidays, Ruth received a letter which contained the alarming news that one
of the younger children was ill with scarlatina, and that she would be obliged to postpone
her return home for at least a few weeks. She was anxious to go at once and help her mother
in her work of nursing, but her parents would not allow her to run the risk of entering the
infected house.

It was disappointing, more especially as she had just gained a handsome prize, which was indeed
fairly hers by right of industry and patience.

Yet after all it was no great hardship to go to the sea-side again with her aunt and cousins
to spend the summer holidays. The reports from Cressleigh were not encouraging. Letter after
letter brought the news that another of the home-birds had been stricken with fever, and for
a week they were all in terrible anxiety about Daisy, the youngest child and pet of the household.
But her life was spared, and she began to recover slowly.

The summer days passed quickly at the sea-side, and when September came Ruth cherished a faint
hope that she might be allowed to return home. A letter from her father, however, dispelled
any such idea. He said that although the invalids were going on well there was a great deal
of fever in the neighbourhood, and the doctor did not consider that it would be safe for her
to return for several months. He thought, therefore, that she could not do better than accept
her aunt's kind offer that she should return with her to Busyborough, and continue to attend
Addison College until Christmas, or even Easter.

Ruth was again disappointed, but she knew that useless murmurs would be a poor return for her
aunt's kindness. So she put a brave face upon the matter, and wiped away the tears that would
come. Like David of old, she encouraged herself in the Lord, and once more took up her daily
duties in the form of lessons and study.

CHAPTER XX.

HOME AGAIN.

It was Easter again before Ruth was allowed to return to Cressleigh. How little she had thought
when she left it that she would not see the old home and its inmates for nearly two years!

But the time had really passed, and the day had come at last when she must bid farewell to
school-days and Busyborough, and take leave of her aunt, uncle, and cousins. Partings are never
pleasant when we are leaving those we love, and Ruth had grown very fond of them all during
her protracted visit. Julia's animosity had been allayed long since, and Mrs. Woburn had grown
to love her niece as a daughter. She had been for some time the peace-making element of the
household, and a great favourite with Rupert, who was growing a fine sturdy boy. Ernest was
sorry to lose her, though, as usual, he was not profuse in his expressions of regret. The shy,
awkward boy was developing into a clever but somewhat reserved young man. Ruth had understood
him far better than any of his own family, and he knew that he should miss her sadly.

The farewells at the house and good-byes at the railway station were painful, and it was a
tearful face of which Mrs. Woburn caught a last glimpse through the carriage window; but when
the train started, Ruth's mind was so full of joyful anticipations of her welcome home that
she could not feel sad. She wondered, as she leaned back and closed her eyes, what they would
think of her, whether her father would think her improved or spoilt, and she began to reflect
how much she had learnt, and what experience she had gained of the world and of her own heart
during her absence. It seemed to her that the Ruth Arnold who had left home nearly two years
ago was a very simple, ignorant little girl, whom she could think of as quite apart from herself.

So busy was she with her thoughts that she scarcely noticed her fellow-passengers leaving the
carriage one by one, until she was aroused by a cry of "All change here." Was that Crook Junction?
Yes, surely. Then she was only ten miles from home.

She hastened from the carriage to look after her luggage, and was astonished to hear a familiar
voice say, "Ruth." It was her father. How kind of him to come to meet her! In a few minutes
both father and daughter were seated in another carriage travelling on the loop line to Cressleigh,
and Ruth was talking very fast, trying to tell all the events of two years in five minutes,
and stopping again and again to ask a question or to recognise some familiar landmark.

Primroses were blooming everywhere, and the country looked gay with them.

"The children were remarking last night," said her father, "that the spring has decorated all
Cressleigh in honour of your return."

"Here we are at last!" cried Ruth, as the train stopped at the well-known little station with
its little garden-strip of bright flowers beside the platform. And there was Will, dear old
Will, grown such a handsome fellow, waiting in the station-yard with the brown mare in the
old light cart.

After a hasty greeting came the drive home along the lanes, where the trees were bursting into
leaf, and the hedgerows were gay with starry blossoms, and the air was delicious after the
smoke of a large town.

The children were waiting at the gate, and a little group stood in the porch to receive her.
It was indeed a home-coming, and the poor girl was almost bewildered by the kissing, the waving,
the shouting, the questions, the entreaties to "look at this," and "come and see that." Mrs.
Arnold was obliged to dismiss the whole party after Ruth had duly admired the floral decorations
in the hall, and had commented upon the many inches added to the various members of the family
during her absence, and secured her a few minutes' quiet by carrying her off to her own room.

How tiny and bare it looked after her comfortable, pretty room at Busyborough, and yet so snug
and sweet! How delightfully fresh was the breeze that blew about the white dimity curtains,
and what a wide range of country she could see instead of a vista of windows, roofs, and chimney-pots!
Yes, indeed, though simple and plain, it was "Home, sweet home," and there was no other place
in the world like it.

Tea followed, a merry, noisy meal, for every one had so much to say, and although Ruth talked
very fast she was not able to reply to half the questions that were put to her. But the exertion
and excitement of the day had made her feel weary, and she was thankful when the evening drew
to a close, and her father took down the big Bible and read a psalm; and in the prayer that
followed he gave thanks for her safe return, and prayed that she might be a comfort and blessing
to all the household. When Ruth lay in her little bed that night her last conscious thought
was of the day's changes and the morrow's duties, and she asked that He who had guided her
in the past would be with her in the future, and that He would help her in her work as the
eldest daughter at home, as He had guided and helped her in her life at Busyborough as The
Country Cousin.
