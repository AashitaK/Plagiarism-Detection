  HON. IRA MAYHEW, Superintendent of Public Instruction:

  SIR: I am instructed by the House of Representatives to transmit to you
  the following preamble and resolution, and to respectfully inform you
  that the same were this day unanimously adopted by the House.

    I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

      A. W. HOVEY, Clerk of the House of Representatives.

Whereas, In the opinion of this House, a Manual on the subject of Popular Education, embracing
such considerations as shall have a tendency to arouse the popular mind to a due appreciation
of the importance--in a political, social, moral, and religious point of view--of securing
to every child in all our borders a good common school education, together with such instructions
to citizens and teachers as shall constitute a directory to the highest improvement of which
our primary schools are susceptible, is a desideratum; therefore,

Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan: That the Hon. IRA MAYHEW,
the present Superintendent of Public Instruction in this state, be requested to prepare for
publication, in book form, the various matters set forth in his public Lectures, delivered
by request of the Legislature, in the Hall of the House, during the present session, together
with such other matter as, in his judgment, would tend to the further improvement of our system
of public instruction; to the end that the necessary information in regard to this subject
may be diffused throughout the state and nation.

 *
* * A Preamble and Resolution similar to the preceding were likewise
adopted by the Senate.

PREFACE.

Who is sufficient for these things? is a question which any one may well ask when sitting down
to the preparation of a treatise on popular education. The author of this work would have shrunk
from the undertaking, but from deference to the judgment of the honorable body that unanimously
invited its preparation. He has also been encouraged not a little by many kind friends, one
of whom, distinguished for his labors in the department of public instruction, writing from
New England, says, "I rejoice at your good beginnings at the West. You have a noble and inspiring
field of action. 'No pent-up Utica contracts your powers.' I beseech you, fail not to fill
it with your glorious educational truth, though you should pour out your spirit and your life
to do so."

The duties required by law of the Superintendent of Public Instruction in the State of Michigan
are comparatively few. The author, however, five years ago, and soon after entering upon the
discharge of those duties, undertook voluntary labors for the purpose of awakening a deeper
interest with all classes of the community in behalf of common schools, and of inspiring confidence
in their redeeming power, when improved as they may be, constituting, as they do, the only
reliable instrumentality for the proper training of the rising generation. These labors, which
were hailed as promising great usefulness, and which were prosecuted in every county of the
state, were every where received with unexpected favor, and constitute the foundation of the
present volume. Many of the subjects then discussed are here greatly amplified.

Among the lectures referred to in the resolution under which this work has been undertaken,
was one on the "Michigan School System." But as the Convention for the revision of the Constitution
of this state is now in session, it has been deemed advisable to omit, in this connection,
the extensive consideration of the details of that system. This may constitute the theme of
a small manual which shall hereafter appear.

In the present volume the author has endeavored so to present the subject of popular education,
which should have reference to the whole man--the body, the mind, and the heart--and so to
unfold its nature, advantages, and claims, as to make it every where acceptable. Nay, more,
he would have a good common education considered as the inalienable right of every child in
the community, and have it placed first among the necessaries of life. For the better accomplishment
of his object, he has freely drawn from the writings of practical educators, his aim being
usefulness rather than originality. This course has been adopted, in some instances, for the
sole purpose of enforcing the sentiments inculcated by the authority of the names introduced.
Acknowledgments have generally been made in the body of the work. These may have been unintentionally
omitted in some instances, and especially in those portions of the work which were written
several years ago, and the sources whence information was drawn are now unknown.

An examination of the table of contents, and especially of the index at the end of the volume,
will show the range of subjects considered, and their adaptation to the wants and necessities,
I may say, of the several classes of persons named in the title-page, for whose use it was
undertaken. Written, as it has been, for Parents and Teachers, and for Young Persons of both
sexes, it is what its title implies--a treatise on Popular Education--and is equally applicable
to the wants of families and schools in every portion of our wide-spread country.

With all its imperfections, of which no one can be more sensible than the author, this volume
is given to the public, with the hope that it may contribute, in some degree, to advance the
work of general education in the United States, but more especially in the State of Michigan.

                                                             IRA MAYHEW.

NATIONAL POPULAR EDUCATION.

CHAPTER I.

IN WHAT DOES A CORRECT EDUCATION CONSIST?

    I call that education which embraces the culture of the whole man,
    with all his faculties--subjecting his senses, his understanding,
    and his passions to reason, to conscience, and to the evangelical
    laws of the Christian revelation.--DE FELLENBERG.

From the beginning of human records to the present time, the inferior animals have changed
as little as the herbage upon which they feed, or the trees beneath which they find shelter.
In one generation, they attain all the perfection of which their nature is susceptible. That
Being without whose notice not even a sparrow falls to the ground, has provided for the supply
of their wants, and has adapted each to the element in which it moves. To birds he has given
a clothing of feathers; and to quadrupeds, of furs, adapted to their latitudes. Where art is
requisite in providing food for future want, or in constructing a needful habitation, as in
the case of the bee and the beaver, a peculiar aptitude has been bestowed, which, in all the
inferior races of animals, has been found adequate to their necessities. The crocodile that
issues from its egg in the warm sand, and never sees its parent, becomes, it has been well
said, as perfect and as knowing as any crocodile.

Not so with man! "He comes into the world," says an eloquent writer, "the most helpless and
dependent of living beings, long to continue so. If deserted by parents at an early age, so
that he can learn only what the experience of one life may teach him--as to a few individuals
has happened, who yet have attained maturity in woods and deserts--he grows up in some respect
inferior to the nobler brutes. Now, as regards many regions of the earth, history exhibits
the early human inhabitants in states of ignorance and barbarism, not far removed from this
lowest possible grade, which civilized men may shudder to contemplate. But these countries,
occupied formerly by straggling hordes of miserable savages, who could scarcely defend themselves
against the wild beasts that shared the woods with them, and the inclemencies of the weather,
and the consequences of want and fatigue; and who to each other were often more dangerous than
any wild beasts, unceasingly warring among themselves, and destroying each other with every
species of savage, and even cannibal cruelty--countries so occupied formerly, are now become
the abodes of myriads of peaceful, civilized, and friendly men, where the desert and impenetrable
forest are changed into cultivated fields, rich gardens, and magnificent cities.

"It is the strong intellect of man, operating with the faculty of language as a means, which
has gradually worked this wonderful change. By language, fathers communicated their gathered
experience and reflections to their children, and these to succeeding children, with new accumulation;
and when, after many generations, the precious store had grown until memory could contain no
more, the arts of writing, and then of printing, arose, making language visible and permanent,
and enlarging illimitably the repositories of knowledge. Language thus, at the present moment
of the world's existence, may be said to bind the whole human race of uncounted millions into
one gigantic rational being, whose memory reaches to the beginnings of written records, and
retains imperishably the important events that have occurred; whose judgment, analyzing the
treasures of memory, has discovered many of the sublime and unchanging laws of nature, and
has built on them all the arts of life, and through them, piercing far into futurity, sees
clearly many of the events that are to come; and whose eyes, and ears, and observing mind at
this moment, in every corner of the earth, are watching and recording new phenomena, for the
purpose of still better comprehending the magnificence and beautiful order of creation, and
of more worthily adoring its beneficent Author.

"It might be very interesting to show here, in minute detail, how the arts of civilization
have progressed in accordance with the gradual increase of man's knowledge of the universe;
but it would lead too far from the main subject." The preceding sketch may remind us of the
low condition of man in a state of ignorance and barbarism, and of the high condition to which
he may be brought by cultivation. We possess a material and an immaterial part, mutually dependent
on each other. On the other hand, the Psalmist says of man, Thou hast made him a little lower
than the angels.

In the Scriptures we learn the origin and history of man--the subject of education. He was
created in the image of his Maker. It was his delightful employment, in innocency, to dress
the beautiful garden in which he dwelt. Presently we learn he transgressed. His subsequent
career becomes infelicitous. In the earlier history of the human race, the days of his pilgrimage
were protracted several hundred years. In process of time, because of the prevalence of sin,
a universal deluge swept away the entire family of man, save one--a preacher of righteousness--and
those of his household. Subsequently his days were shortened to three score years and ten.
Much of this time is consumed in helpless infancy, in sleep, and in securing the necessary
means of supporting animal life. This, it would seem, is calamity enough; but not so. Man finds
himself beset with temptations on every side, to deepen and perpetuate his degradation, by
giving reign to unbridled passion.

But a Light has shined upon his dark pathway, pointing him to a brighter country, and beckoning
him thither. Under these adverse circumstances, it becomes the duty of the Educator to unfold
the opening energies of his youthful charge; to mold their plastic character, and to assist
their efforts in the recovery of that which was lost, and in the attainment of immortality
and eternal life.

These are strong views, I am aware; but nothing less would be adequate to the nature and wants
of man. In these views I am fully sustained by nearly every writer of any distinction in Europe
and America. In a volume of prize essays on the expediency and means of elevating the profession
of the educator in society, published in London, under the direction of the central society
of education, one of the writers, introducing a quotation from an American author, says, I
can not resist the pleasure of quoting a few of Alcott's brief sentences, by way of conclusion
to the present division of the argument. The voice that has been sent athwart the Atlantic
may find an echo in some British bosoms.

These are its words: "Education includes all those influences and disciplines by which the
faculties of man are unfolded and perfected. It is that agency that takes the helpless and
pleading infant from the hands of its Creator, and, apprehending its entire nature, tempts
it forth, now by austere, and now by kindly influences and disciplines, and thus molds it at
last into the image of a perfect man; armed at all points to use the body, nature, and life
for its growth and renewal, and to hold dominion over the fluctuating things of the outward.
It seeks to realize in the soul the image of the Creator. Its end is a perfect man. Its aim,
through every stage of influence, is self-renewal. The body, nature, and life are its instruments
and materials. Jesus is its worthiest ideal--Christianity its purest organ. The Gospels are
its fullest text-book--genius is its inspiration--holiness its law--temperance its discipline--immortality
its reward."

Says Dr. Howe, in a lecture before the American Institute of Instruction, "Education should
have for its aim the development and greatest possible perfection of the whole nature of man:
his moral, intellectual, and physical nature. My beau ideal of human nature would be a being
whose intellectual faculties were active and enlightened; whose moral sentiments were dignified
and firm; whose physical formation was healthy and beautiful: whoever falls short of this,
in one particular--be it in but the least, beauty and vigor of body--falls short of the standard
of perfection. To this standard, I believe, man is approaching; and I believe the time will
soon be when specimens of it will not be rare."

The following thoughts are drawn from a treatise on the "Mental Illumination and Moral Improvement
of Mankind," by that very judicious and celebrated writer, Dr. Dick, of Scotland. The education
of human beings, considered in its most extensive sense, comprehends every thing which is requisite
to the cultivation and improvement of the faculties bestowed upon them by the Creator. It ought
to embrace every thing that has a tendency to strengthen and invigorate the animal system;
to enlighten and expand the understanding; to regulate the feelings and dispositions of the
heart; and, in general, to direct the moral powers in such a manner as to render those who
are the subjects of instruction happy in themselves, useful members of society, and qualified
for entering upon the scenes and employments of a future and more glorious existence.

It is a very common but absurd notion, and one that has been too long acted upon, that the
education of youth terminates, or should terminate, about the age of thirteen or fourteen years.
Hence, in an article on this subject in one of our encyclopedias, education is defined to be
"that series of means by which the human understanding is gradually enlightened, between infancy
and the period when we consider ourselves as qualified to take a part in active life, and,
ceasing to direct our views to the acquisition of new knowledge or the formation of new habits,
are content to act upon the principles we have already acquired."

This definition, though accordant with general opinion and practice, is certainly a very limited
and defective view of the subject. In the ordinary mode of our scholastic instruction, education,
so far from being finished at the age above stated, can scarcely be said to have commenced.
The key of knowledge has indeed been put into the hands of the young; but they have never been
taught to unlock the gates to the temple of science, to enter within its portals, to contemplate
its treasures, and to feast their minds on the entertainments there provided. Several moral
maxims have been impressed on their memories; but they have seldom been taught to appreciate
them in all their bearings, or to reduce them to practice in the various and minute ramifications
of their conduct. Besides, although every rational means were employed for training the youthful
mind till the age above named, no valid reason can be assigned why regular instruction should
cease at this early period.

Man is a progressive being; his faculties are capable of an indefinite expansion; the objects
to which these faculties may be directed are boundless and infinitely diversified; he is moving
onward to an eternal world, and, in the present state, can never expect to grasp the universal
system of created objects, or to rise to the highest point of moral excellence. His tuition,
therefore, can not be supposed to terminate at any period of his terrestrial existence; and
the course of his life ought to be considered as nothing more than the course of his education.
When he closes his eyes in death, and bids a last adieu to every thing here below, he passes
into a more permanent and expansive state of existence, where his education will likewise be
progressive, and where intelligences of a higher order may be his instructors; and the education
he received in this transitory scene, if it was properly conducted, will found the ground-work
of all his future progressions in knowledge and virtue throughout the succeeding periods of
eternity.

There are two very glaring defects which appear in most of our treatises on education. In the
first place, the moral tuition of youthful minds, and the grand principles of religion which
ought to direct their views and conduct, are either entirely overlooked, or treated of in so
vague and general a manner, as to induce a belief that they are considered matters of very
inferior moment; and, in the business of teaching, and the superintendence of the young, the
moral precepts of Christianity are seldom made to bear with particularity upon every malignant
affection that manifests itself, and every minor delinquency that appears in their conduct,
or to direct the benevolent affections how to operate in every given circumstance, and in all
their intercourses and associations. In the next place, the idea that man is a being destined
to an immortal existence, is almost, if not altogether overlooked. Volumes have been written
on the best modes of training men for the profession of a soldier, of a naval officer, of a
merchant, of a physician, of a lawyer, of a clergyman, and of a statesman; but I know of no
treatise on this subject which, in connection with other subordinate aims, has for its grand
object to develop that train of instruction which is most appropriate for man considered as
a candidate for immortality. This is the more unaccountable, since, in the works alluded to,
the eternal destiny of human beings is not called in question, and is sometimes referred to
as a general position which can not be denied; yet the means of instruction requisite to guide
them in safety to their final destination, and to prepare them for the employments of their
everlasting abode, are either overlooked, or referred to in general terms, as if they were
unworthy of particular consideration. To admit the doctrine of the immortality of the human
soul, and yet to leave out the consideration of it, in a system of mental instruction, is both
impious and preposterous, and inconsistent with the principle on which we generally act in
other cases, which requires that affairs of the greatest moment should occupy our chief attention.
If man is only a transitory inhabitant of this lower world; if he is journeying to another
and more important scene of action and enjoyment; if his abode in this higher scene is to be
permanent and eternal; and if the course of instruction through which he now passes has an
important bearing on his happiness in that state, and his preparation for its enjoyments--if
all this be true, then surely every system of education must be glaringly defective which either
overlooks or throws into the shade the immortal destination of human beings.

If these sentiments be admitted as just, the education of the young becomes a subject of the
highest importance. There can not be an object more interesting to Science, to Religion, and
to general Christian society, than the forming of those arrangements, and the establishing
of those institutions, which are calculated to train the minds of all to knowledge and moral
rectitude, and to guide their steps in the path which leads to a blessed immortality. In this
process there is no period in human life that aught to be overlooked. We must commence the
work of instruction when the first dawning of reason begins to appear, and continue the process
through all the succeeding periods of mortal existence, till the spirit takes its flight to
the world unknown.

While we would bring clearly into view the nature of that education which is needful for man,
considered as a candidate for immortality, we would by no means overlook those subordinate
aims which have reference to his present condition, and the relations he sustains in this life.
The two are so intimately connected, and sustain such a reciprocal relation to each other,
that each is best secured by that system of training and in the use of those appliances by
which the other is most successfully promoted. In training the rising generation for the proper
discharge of their duty to themselves and to one another--as children, and subsequently as
parents; as members of society and citizens of free and independent states--we at the same
time best promote their interests as candidates for immortality. It is equally true that any
system of education which omits to provide for man's highest and enduring wants as an immortal
being, in a proportionate degree falls short of providing for his dearest interests and best
good in this life.

The system of education which we should promote comprehends whatever may have any good influence
in developing the mind, by giving direction to thought, or bias the motives of action. To lead
infancy in the path of duty, to give direction to an immortal spirit, and to teach it to aspire
by well-doing to the rewards of virtue, is the first step of instruction. To youth, education
imparts that knowledge whose ways are usefulness and honor, and by due restraint and subordination,
makes individual to intwine with public good in a just observance of laws, comprehending the
path of duty. To manhood, it "leads him to reflect on the ties that unite him with friends,
with kindred, and with the great family of mankind, and makes his bosom glow with social tenderness;
it confirms the emotions of sympathy into habitual benevolence, imparts to him the elating
delight of rejoicing with those who rejoice, and, if his means are not always adequate to the
suggestions of his charity, soothes him at last with the melancholy pleasure of weeping with
those who weep." To age, it gives consolation, by remembrance of the past, and anticipation
of the future. Wisdom is drawn from experience, to give constancy to virtue; and amid all the
vicissitudes of life, it enables him to repose unshaken confidence in that goodness which,
by the arrangement of the universe, constantly incites him to perpetual progress in excellence
and felicity. Education is the growth and improvement of the mind. Its great object is immediate
and prospective happiness. That, then, is the best education which secures to the individual
and to the world the greatest amount of permanent happiness, and that the best system which
most effectually accomplishes this grand design. How far this is accomplished by the present
systems of education is not easily determined, but that it fails in many important considerations
can not admit of a doubt.

It is feared that, by a great majority, a wrong estimate is made of education. Is it not generally
considered as a means which must be employed to accomplish some other purpose, and consequently
made subservient and secondary to the employments of life? Is it not considered as being contained
in books, and a certain routine of studies, which, when gone through with, is believed to be
accomplished, and consequently laid by, to be used as interest may suggest or convenience demand?
Education comprehends all the improvements of the mind from the cradle to the grave. Every
man is what education has made him, whether he has drunk deep at the Pierian spring, or sipped
at the humblest fountain. The philosopher, whose comprehensive mind can scan the universe,
and read and interpret the phenomena of nature; whose heaven-aspiring spirit can soar beyond
the boundaries of time, indulge in the anticipation of immortality, and discern in the past,
the present, and the future the all-pervading spirit of benevolence, is equally the child of
education with him whose soul proud science never taught to feel its wants, and know how little
may be known.

As we have already said, man possesses a material and an immaterial part, mutually dependent
on each other. These are so intimately connected, and sustain such a reciprocal relation to
each other, that neither can be neglected without detriment to both. The body continually modifies
the state of the mind, and the mind ever varies the condition of the body. Mental and physical
training should, then, go together. That system of instruction which relates exclusively to
either, is a partial system, and its fate must be that of a house divided against itself. Education
has reference to the whole man. It seeks to make him a complete creature after his kind, giving
to both mind and body all the power, all the beauty, and all the perfection of which they are
capable.

Our systems of education have hitherto fallen far short of this high and only true standard.
Education, in too many instances, has been confined, almost entirely, to either the physical,
intellectual, or moral energies of men. With the greater part, it has been limited to the physical
powers. No effort has been made to develop any but their bodily strength, animal passions,
and instinctive feelings. Accordingly, the great mass of mankind are raised but little above
inferior animals. They labor hard, and boast of their strength; gratify their passions, and
glory in their shame; eat and drink, sleep and wake, supposing to-morrow will be like the present.
They are scarcely aware of their rational, intellectual powers, much less of their ever-expanding
and never-dying spirits; consequently they feel but imperfectly their responsibility, and are
governed principally by the fear of human authority. They have been taught to fear or reverence
nothing higher. Their education is confined to animal feeling--physical energies. They have
no conception of any thing beyond. The whole intellectual world, and all hereafter, is narrowed
down to the animal feeling of the present time. How erroneous! How badly educated! And what
are we to anticipate when only the physical energies of men generally are thus developed? Why,
surely, what we are beginning to witness--namely, physical power, trampling on all authority.

The education of others is confined principally to intellect. Not that their physical powers
are not necessarily more or less developed, but that their attention is directed almost exclusively
to intellectual attainments. From the earliest infancy their minds are taxed, though their
bodies are neglected, and their souls forgotten. Nor is it unfrequent that their physical strength
gives way under the constant pressure of intellectual studies. And thus they are subjected
to all the evils of physical inability--the sufferings of living death, in consequence of an
erroneous education. Besides, they are destitute of all those kinder feelings and sympathetic
emotions which alone result from the cultivation of the moral susceptibilities, and become
insensible to the more delicate affections of the soul, and elevating hopes of the truly virtuous.
They have nothing on which to rest for enjoyment but intellectual attainments. And even these
are small compared with what they might have been under a different course of education. Yet
with what delight are the first developments of intellect discovered by the natural guardian
of the infant mind! and with what anxious solicitude are they watched through advancing youth
and manhood by those employed in their education. In either stage the development of intellect
alone seems worthy of an effort. And yet, when carried to the utmost, what may we expect of
one destitute of virtue, and without strength of body? Little to benefit himself or others.
Like Columbus, Franklin, or La Place, he may employ his intellect in useful discoveries; or,
like Hume, Voltaire, and Paine, to curse the world. In either case he may lead astray, and
should never be trusted implicitly. As the bark on the ocean without compass or chart, that
rides out the storm or sinks to the bottom, he may guide us in safety, or ruin us forever!

The education of others, again, is confined mostly to their moral energies. Those of the body
are almost forgotten, only as nature forces their development upon the reluctant soul within.
And those of intellect are deemed unworthy of a thought, except as necessary in the rudest
stages of society; while the moral susceptibilities are cultivated to the utmost. They are
brought into action in every situation. They are employed in private, in the social circle,
and around the public altar. Nor are those employing them ever satisfied. They become fanatics--religious
enthusiasts. They have zeal without knowledge, and seem resolved on bringing all to their standard.
They enlist in the work all the sympathies of the soul--its tenderest sensibilities and most
compassionate feelings. Without intellect to guide, and physical strength to sustain them,
they sink under moral excitement, and become deranged: a result that might be anticipated from
such an education; and one that is often developed, in some of its milder features, among the
reformers of the day. Nor may you reason with them. Reckless of consequences and regardless
of authority, they are not to be convinced or persuaded. They are right, and know they are
right, for the plain reason that they know nothing else, and will not be diverted from their
course. What degradation! Who would not shrink from such an education? the development of the
moral energies merely? It never qualified men for the highest attainment--the utmost dignity
of which they are susceptible.

Diversified as are the developments of human character, and dissimilar as they may appear to
the careless observer, there are peculiar characteristics of men that render them similar to
one another, and unlike every other being. In their natures, original susceptibilities, and
ultimate destinies, they are alike. They are material, intellectual, and spiritual; animal,
rational, and immortal. On these uniform traits of character education should be based. It
should develop and strengthen the animal functions; classify and improve the rational faculties;
and purify and elevate the spiritual affections in harmonious proportion and perfect symmetry.

The animal functions of the human system are to be developed and strengthened by education.
Hitherto they have been assigned to the province of nature, and deemed foreign to the objects
of education. But a more unphilosophical and dangerous theory has seldom been embraced, as
the melancholy results abundantly testify. We shall therefore devote a chapter to physical
education, which seems to lie at the foundation of the great work of human improvement; for,
as we have seen, in the present state the mind can manifest itself only through the body; after
which we shall proceed to the consideration of the other grand divisions of the great work
of education.

CHAPTER II.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION.

    The influence of the physical frame upon the intellect, morals, and
    happiness of a human being, is now universally admitted. The extent
    of this influence will be thought greater in proportion to the
    accuracy with which the subject is examined. Bodily pain forms a
    large proportion of the amount of human misery. It is, therefore, of
    the highest importance that a child should grow up sound and healthy
    in body, with the utmost degree of muscular strength that education
    can communicate.--LALOR.

The importance of the department of the great work of education which we now approach has not
hitherto been duly appreciated by parents and teachers generally. I shall therefore devote
more space to this subject than is usual in works on education, but not more, I trust, than
its relative importance demands. Physical, intellectual, and moral education are so intimately
connected, that, in order duly to appreciate the importance of either, we must not view it
separate and alone merely, but in connection with both of the others. And especially is this
true of physical education. However much value, then, we may attach to it on its own account,
considering man as a corporeal being, we shall have occasion greatly to magnify its importance
when we come to direct our attention to his intellectual culture, and still more when we view
it in connection with his moral training. Then, and not till then, shall we be enabled, in
some degree, properly to appreciate the importance of physical education.

It has been objected, says Dr. Combe,[1] that to teach any one how to take care of his own
health, is sure to do harm, by making him constantly think of this and the other precaution,
to the utter sacrifice of every noble and generous feeling, and to the certain production of
peevishness and discontent. The result, however, he adds, is exactly the reverse; and it would
be a singular anomaly in the constitution of the moral world were it otherwise. He who is instructed
in, and is familiar with grammar and orthography, writes and spells so easily and accurately
as scarcely to be conscious of attending to the rules by which he is guided; while he, on the
contrary, who is not instructed in either, and knows not how to arrange his sentences, toils
at the task, and sighs at every line. The same principle holds in regard to health. He who
is acquainted with the general constitution of the human body, and with the laws which regulate
its action, sees at once his true position when exposed to the causes of disease, decides what
ought to be done, and thereafter feels himself at liberty to devote his undivided attention
to the calls of higher duties. But it is far otherwise with the person who is destitute of
this information. Uncertain of the nature and extent of the danger, he knows not to which hand
to turn, and either lives in the fear of mortal disease, or, in his ignorance, resorts to irrational
and hurtful precautions, to the certain neglect of those which he ought to use. It is ignorance,
therefore, and not knowledge, which renders an individual full of fancies and apprehensions,
and robs him of his usefulness. It would be a stigma on the Creator's wisdom if true knowledge
weakened the understanding, and led to injurious results. Those who have had the most extensive
opportunities of forming an opinion on this subject from extensive experience, bear unequivocal
testimony to the advantages which knowledge confers in saving health and life, time and anxiety.

  [1] Principles of Physiology applied to the Preservation of Health.

If, indeed, ignorance were itself a preventive of the danger, or could provide a remedy when
it approached, then it might well be said that "ignorance is bliss;" but as it gives only the
kind of security which shutting the eyes affords against the dangers of a precipice, and consequently
leaves its victim doubly exposed, it is high time to renounce its protection, and to seek those
of a more powerful and beneficent ally. Every medical man can testify that, natural character
and other circumstances being alike, those whose knowledge is the most limited are the fullest
of whims and fancies; the most credulous respecting the efficacy of every senseless and preposterous
remedy; the most impatient of restraint, and the most discontented at suffering.

If any of my readers be still doubtful of the propriety or safety of communicating physiological
knowledge to the public at large, continues the author from whom we last quoted, and think
that ignorance is in all circumstances to be preferred, I would beg leave to ask him whether
it was knowledge or ignorance which induced the poorer classes in every country of Asia and
Europe to attempt to protect themselves from cholera by committing ravages on the medical attendants
of the sick, under the plea of their having poisoned the public fountains? And whether it was
ignorance or knowledge which prompted the more rational part of the community to seek safety
in increased attention to proper food, warmth, cleanliness, and clothing? In both cases, the
desire of safety and sense of danger were the same, but the modes resorted to by each were
as different in kind as in result, the efficacy of the one having formed a glaring contrast
to the failure of the other.

Dr. Southwood Smith, the able author of a volume entitled "The Philosophy of Health," says,
The obvious and peculiar advantages of this kind of knowledge are, that it would enable its
possessor to take a more rational care of his health; to perceive why certain circumstances
are beneficial or injurious; to understand, in some degree, the nature of disease, and the
operation as well of the agents which produce it as of those which counteract it; to observe
the first beginnings of deranged function in his own person; to give to his physician a more
intelligible account of his train of morbid sensations, as they arise; and, above all, to co-operate
with him in removing the morbid state on which they depend, instead of defeating, as is now,
through ignorance, constantly the case, the best concerted plans for the renovation of health.
It would likewise lay the foundation for the attainment of a more just, accurate, and practical
knowledge of our intellectual and moral nature. There is a physiology of the mind as well as
of the body, and both are so intimately united that neither can be well understood without
the study of the other. The physiology of man comprehends both. Were even what is already known
of this science and what might be easily communicated made a part of general education, how
many evils would be avoided! how much light would be let in upon the understanding! and how
many aids would be afforded to the acquisition of a sound body and a vigorous mind! prerequisites
more important than are commonly supposed to the attainment of wisdom and the practice of virtue.

Human physiology, says Dr. Combe, in his admirable treatise on that subject, from which I have
already quoted, is as important in its practical consequences as it is attractive to rational
curiosity. In its widest sense, it comprehends an exposition of the functions of the various
organs of which the human frame is composed; of the mechanism by which they are carried on;
of their relations to each other, or the means of improving their development and action; of
the purposes to which they ought severally to be directed, and of the manner in which exercise
ought to be conducted, so as to secure for the organ the best health, and for the function
the highest efficacy. A true system of physiology comes thus to be the proper basis, not only
of a sound physical, but of a sound moral and intellectual education, and of a rational hygiene;
or, in other words, it is the basis of every thing having for its object the physical and mental
health and improvement of man; for, so long as life lasts, the mental and moral powers with
which he is endowed manifest themselves through the medium of organization, and no plan which
he can devise for their cultivation, that is not in harmony with the laws which regulate that
organization, can possibly be successful.

Let it not be said that knowledge of this description is superfluous to the unprofessional
reader; for society groans under the load of suffering inflicted by causes susceptible of removal,
but left in operation in consequence of our unacquaintance with our own structure, and of the
relation of different parts of the system to each other and to external objects. Every medical
man must have felt and lamented the ignorance so generally prevalent in regard to the simplest
functions of the animal system, and the consequent absence of the judicious co-operation of
friends in the care and cure of the sick. From ignorance of the commonest facts in physiology,
or from want of ability to appreciate their importance, men of much good sense in every other
respect not only subject themselves unwittingly to the active causes of disease, but give their
sanction to laws and practices destructive equally to life and to morality, and which, if they
saw them in their true light, they would shrink from countenancing in the slightest degree.

Were the intelligent classes of society better acquainted with the functions of the human body
and the laws by which they are regulated, continues this judicious writer, the sources of much
suffering would be dried up, and the happiness of the community at large would be essentially
promoted. Medical men would no longer be consulted so exclusively for the cure of disease,
but would be called upon to advise regarding the best means of strengthening the constitution,
from an early period, against any accidental or hereditary susceptibility which might be ascertained
to exist. More attention would be paid to the preservation of health than is at present practicable,
and the medical man would then be able to advise with increased effect, because he would be
proportionally well understood, and his counsel, in so far, at least, as it was based on accurate
observation and a right application of principles, would be perceived to be, not a mere human
opinion, but, in reality, an exposition of the will and intentions of a beneficent Creator,
and would therefore be felt as carrying with it an authority to which, as the mere dictum of
a fallible fellow-creature, it could never be considered as entitled.

It is true that, as yet, medicine has been turned to little account in the way of directly
promoting the physical and mental welfare of man. But the day is, perhaps, not far distant,
when, in consequence of the improvements both in professional and general education now in
progress, a degree of interest will be attached to this application of its doctrines far surpassing
what those who have not reflected on the subject will be able to imagine as justly belonging
to it, but by no means exceeding that which it truly deserves.

Every person should be acquainted with the organization, structure, and functions of his own
body--the house in which he lives: he should know the conditions of health, and the causes
of the numerous diseases that flesh is heir to, in order to avoid them, prolong his life, and
multiply his means of usefulness. If these things are not otherwise learned, they should be
taught--the elements of them at least--in our primary schools. This instruction would come,
perhaps, most appropriately from the members of the medical profession. But either society
generally, or physicians themselves, or both, have mistaken the true sphere of a physician's
usefulness, and what ought to constitute the grand object of his profession, namely, the prevention
of disease, and the general improvement of the health, and not the CURING of diseases merely.
The physician, like the clergyman in his parish, should receive a salary; and he should be
occupied, chiefly, in teaching the laws of health to his employers; in imparting to them instruction
in relation to the means of avoiding the diseases to which they are more particularly exposed,
and in laying before them such information as shall be needful, in order to the highest improvement
of their physical organization, and the transmission to posterity of unimpaired constitutions.
This he may do by public lectures, at suitable seasons of the year; and by visiting from house
to house, and imparting such information as may be particularly needed. The physician should
not allow any of his employers blindly to disregard the laws of health, or, knowing them, to
violate them unreproved. He should be accounted the best physician, other things being equal,
whose employers have the least sickness, and uniformly enjoy the best health. When the relation
existing between the members of the medical profession and the well-being of society generally
comes to be better understood, and physicians are employed in accordance with the principles
just stated, their greatest usefulness to the communities they serve will be found to consist
in teaching well men and women how to retain and improve their health, and rear a healthy offspring,
and not in partially curing diseased persons who are constantly violating the laws of health.
These views will doubtless be new to many of my readers, and seem to them very strange! But
let me inquire of such what they would think of the clergyman who should neglect to instruct
his parishioners in the ennobling doctrines of morality and religion, and should suffer them
to go on in sin unrebuked, until they become a burden to themselves? who should wait until
his counsels were solicited before he sounds the note of alarm, and points the guilty sinner
to "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world?" and who should confine his labors
almost entirely to condemned criminals? Such conduct on the part of clergymen would doubtless
be regarded by these very persons as passing strange! The course commonly pursued in the employment
of physicians is equally unphilosophical, and floods society with a legion of evils--physical
and intellectual, social and moral--three fourths of which might be avoided, by the proper
exercise of the medical profession, in one generation; and ultimately, nineteen twentieths,
if not ninety-nine one hundredths of them. As I have already said, this instruction would come,
perhaps, most appropriately from the members of the medical profession. But if these things
are not taught elsewhere, I repeat it, they should be taught--the elements of them at least--in
our primary schools.

I can not better enforce the importance of physical education than by quoting from a lecture
"on the education of the blind," by one of the most distinguished practical educators[2] in
this country. "That the proportion of the blind to the whole population might be diminished
by wise social regulations, and by the dissemination of knowledge of the organic laws of man,
there is not a doubt; but whether the time has come, or ever will come, is another question.
At any rate, to so enlightened a body[3] as I have the honor of addressing, suggestions of
methods by which the extent of blindness may be limited will neither be misapplied, nor liable
to offend a mawkish sensibility. That the blindness of a large proportion of society is a social
evil will not be denied, nor will the right which society has to diminish that proportion be
questioned. But how? in a very simple way; by preventing the transmission of an hereditary
blindness to another generation; by preventing the marriage of those who are congenitally blind,
or who have lost their sight by reason of hereditary weakness of the visual organs, which disqualifies
them to resist the slightest inflammation or injury in childhood.

  [2] Dr. Samuel G. Howe, director of the New England Institution for the
  Education of the Blind, 1836.

  [3] The American Institute of Instruction.

"I am aware that many people would condemn this proposition as cruel, because it might add
to the sadness of the sufferers; and that the whole seven thousand five hundred blind in this
country would rise up and scout it, as barbarous and unnatural; for I have experienced the
effects of contradiction to the wills of individual blind persons in this respect. But my rule
is, the good of the community before that of the individual; the good of the race before that
of the community. To give you an instance: the city of Boston, with a population of eighty
thousand, is represented in the Institution for the Blind by two blind children only; and I
know of but four in the whole population; while Andover, with but five thousand, is fully and
ably represented by seven;[4] and it has three more growing up.

  [4] This makes the ratio of representation in the institution from
  Andover fifty six times greater than from the city of Boston.

"Now how is this? Why, the blind of Andover are mostly from a common stock; three of them are
born of one mother, who has had four blind children. Another of the pupils is cousin, in the
first degree, to these three; and two other pupils are cousins in a remote degree. Then, from
other places, there are two brothers, who have a third at home. There is one blind girl, who
has two blind sisters at home. Then there are two pairs of sisters.

"In the immediate vicinity of Boston, I know of a family in which blindness is hereditary;
the last generation there were five. Of these five one is married, and has four children, not
one of whom can see well enough to read; and if the others marry, they may increase the number
to twelve or twenty.

"Now apply this state of things to the whole country, and have you any difficulty in conceiving
how it happens that there are seven thousand five hundred blind in the United States? And can
you doubt whether or not this great proportion of blind to the whole community might not be
considerably diminished, if men and women understood the organic laws of their nature? understood
that, very often, blindness is the punishment following an infringement of the natural laws
of God; and if they could be made to act upon the holy Christian principles, that we should
deny ourselves any individual gratification, any selfish desire, that may result in evil to
the whole community?

"I would that every individual whom I have the honor to address would assist in the education
of the blind, so far as to give them just and Christian views of this subject. I would that
all should work for society; not for society to-day alone, but for the society of future ages;
not in any one narrow, partial way, but upon a broad scale, and in every way in which they
can be useful. If a person congenitally blind, or strongly predisposed to become so, or one
who marries a person so born or so disposed, has blind offspring in consequence of it, I ask,
is he not as responsible, in a moral point of view, for the infirmity of his children as though
he had put out their eyes with his own hands?

"You may suppose, perhaps, that the infirmity of blindness would incapacitate sufferers from
winning the affections of seeing persons; and that, with respect to two blind persons, the
sense of incapacity to support a family would prevent them from uniting themselves. In the
first place, I answer, that seeing people do no better than the blind. Even a blind man may
perceive that many marriages are mere matters of course, resulting from juxtaposition of parties;
and rarely matters where the purer affections and higher moral sentiments are consulted. And,
in the second place, that incapacity of supporting a family will not weigh a feather in the
balance with desire, unless the intellectual and moral nature is enlightened and cultivated.
Do we not see, every day, cases of misery entailed upon whole families, because one of the
parties had overlooked or disregarded moral infirmity, which ought to have been a greater objection
than any physical defect--than even blindness or deafness?

"But no process of reasoning is required, for there stand the facts. The blind not only seek
for partners in life, but are sometimes sought by seeing persons; and numerous instances have
occurred within my knowledge. It is true, that despair of success in any other quarter, or
an equally unworthy motive, may induce some to seek for partners among the blind, or the blind
to unite with the blind; but still, there is the evil.

"My observation induces me to think that the blind, far more than seeing persons, are fond
of social relations, and desirous of family endearments. A moment's thought would induce one
to conclude that this would naturally be the case; a moment's observation convinces one that
it is so. Now I have found among them some of the most pious, intelligent, and disinterested
beings I ever knew; but hardly more than one who was prepared to forego the enjoyments of domestic
relations. And how can we expect them to be so, more than seeing people? The fact is, but very
few persons in the community give any attention to the laws of their organic nature, and the
tendency to hereditary transmission of infirmities. Very few consider that they owe more to
society than to their individual selves; that if we are to love our neighbor as ourself, we
must, of course, love all our neighbors, collectively, more than the single unit which each
one calls I.

"I would that considerations of this kind had more weight with the community generally. I would
that the subject were more attended to, and that the violation of the laws of our organic nature
were less frequent in our country. There is one great and crying evil in our system of education;
it is, that but part of man's nature is educated, and that our colleges and schools doom young
men for years to an uninterrupted and severe exercise of the intellectual faculties, to the
comparative neglect of their moral, and still more of their physical nature. Nay, not only
do they neglect their physical nature--they ABUSE it; they sin against themselves and against
God; and though they sin in ignorance, they do not escape the penalties of His violated laws.
Hence you see them pale, and wan, and feeble; hence you find them acknowledging, when too late,
the effects of severe application. But do they acknowledge it humbly and repentingly, as with
a consciousness of sin? No, they often do it with a secret exultation, with a lurking feeling
that you will say or think, 'Poor fellow, his mind is too much for his body!' Nonsense! his
mind is too weak; his knowledge too limited; he is an imperfect man; he knows not his own nature.
But if he has no conscientiousness, no scruple about impairing his own health and sowing the
seeds of disease, he has less about entailing them upon others. And a consumptive young man
or woman--the son or daughter of consumptive parents--hesitates not to spread the evil in society,
and entail puny faces, weakness, pain, and early death upon several individuals, and punish
their children for their own sins.

"Is this picture too high-colored? Alas! no. And if I showed you satisfactorily that sin against
the organic laws caused so great a proportion of blindness, how much more readily will you
grant that the same sin gives to so many of our population the narrow chest, the hectic flush,
the hollow cough, which makes the victim doomed, by his parent, to consumption and early death!
Do you not see, every Sabbath, at church, the young man or woman, upon whose fair and delicate
structure the peculiar impress of the EARLY DOOMED is stamped? and as a slight but hollow cough
comes upon your ear, does it not recall the death-knell which rang in the same sad note before
to the father or mother? Who of you has not followed some young friend to his long resting-place,
and found that the grass had not grown rank upon the grave of his brother? that the row of
white marbles, beneath which slept his parents and sisters, were yet glistering in freshness,
and that the letters which told their names and their early death seemed clear as if cut but
yesterday?

"They tell us that physical education is attended to in this country; and yet, where is the
teacher, where is the clergyman even, who dares to step forth in these cases, and say to those
who are doomed, you must not and shall not marry? and where are the young men and women who
would listen to them if they did? It is not that they are wanting in conscientiousness; they
may be conscientious and disinterested; but they do not know that they are doing wrong, because
they are not acquainted with the organic laws of their nature. All that is done in schools
or colleges toward physical education is the mere strengthening of the muscular system by muscular
exercise; but this is not half enough. These remarks may be deemed irrelevant to my subject,
but they can not be lost to an audience whose highest interest is the education of man; and
if I am mistaken in supposing that little attention has been paid to the subject, its importance
will guaranty its repetition."

Before dismissing this subject, I will introduce two additional quotations from American authors,
whose opinions are received by the medical profession in this country not only, but throughout
Europe. In both instances, I copy from works published in Great Britain, into which the opinions
of these American writers have been quoted. In regard to hereditary transmission, Dr. Caldwell
observes: "Every constitutional quality, whether good or bad, may descend, by inheritance,
from parent to child. And a long-continued habit of drunkenness becomes as essentially constitutional
as a predisposition to gout or pulmonary consumption. This increases, in a manifold degree,
the responsibility of parents in relation to temperance. By habits of intemperance, they not
only degrade and ruin themselves, but transmit the elements of like degradation and ruin to
their posterity. This is no visionary conjecture, the fruit of a favorite and long-cherished
theory. It is a settled belief resulting from observation--an inference derived from innumerable
facts. In hundreds and thousands of instances, parents, having had children born to them while
their habits were temperate, have become afterward intemperate, and had other children subsequently
born. In such cases, it is a matter of notoriety that the younger children have become addicted
to the practice of intoxication much more frequently than the older, in the proportion of five
to one. Let me not be told that this is owing to the younger children being neglected, and
having corrupt and seducing examples constantly before them. The same neglects and profligate
examples have been extended to all, yet all have not been equally injured by them. The children
of the earlier births have escaped, while those of the subsequent ones have suffered. The reason
is plain. The latter children had a deeper animal taint than the former."--Transylvania Journal.

Physiologists in general coincide in the belief that a vigorous and healthy physical and mental
constitution in the parents communicates existence in the most perfect state to their offspring,
while impaired constitutions, from whatever cause, are transmitted to posterity. Strictly speaking,
it is not disease which is transmitted, but organs of such imperfect structure that they are
unable to perform their functions properly, and so weak as to be easily put into a morbid state
or abnormal condition by causes which unimpaired organs are able to resist.

My last quotation on this point is from a lecture delivered by Dr. Warren before the American
Institute of Instruction, copied into the "Schoolmaster," a work published in London under
the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge:

"Let me conclude by entreating your attention to a revision of the existing plans of education
in what relates to the preservation of health. Too much of the time of the better educated
part of young persons is, in my humble opinion, devoted to literary pursuits and sedentary
occupations, and too little to the acquisition of the corporeal powers indispensable to make
the former practically useful. If the present system does not undergo some change, I much apprehend
we shall see a degenerate and sinking race, such as came to exist among the higher classes
in France before the Revolution, and such as now deforms a large part of the noblest families
in Spain;[5] but if the spirit of improvement, so happily awakened, continues--as I trust it
will--to animate those concerned in the formation of the young members of society, we shall
soon be able, I doubt not, to exhibit an active, beautiful, and wise generation, of which the
age may be proud."

  [5] I am informed by a lady who passed a long time at the Spanish court,
  in a distinguished situation, that the grandees have deteriorated by
  their habits of living, and the restriction of intermarriages to their
  own rank, to a race of dwarfs; and, though fine persons are sometimes
  seen among them, they, when assembled at court, appear to be a group of
  manikins.

CHAPTER III.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION. THE LAWS OF HEALTH.

    If man is ever to be elevated to the highest and happiest condition
    which his nature will permit, it must be, in no small degree, by the
    improvement--I might say, the redemption--of his physical powers.
    But knowledge on any subject must precede improvement.--ALCOTT.

    Physical and moral health are as nearly related as the body and the
    soul.--HUFELAND'S Art of Prolonging Life.

If the reader is persuaded that the views presented in the last chapter on the importance of
physical education are truthful--and they are concurred in by physiologists generally--he will
naturally desire to become acquainted with the laws of health, that, by yielding obedience
to them, he may improve his physical condition, and most successfully promote his intellectual
and moral well-being. I might, then, here refer to some of the many excellent treatises on
this subject; but I shall probably better accomplish the object for which this work has been
undertaken by presenting, within as narrow limits as practicable, a summary of these laws.

In every department of nature, waste is invariably the result of action. In mechanics, we seek
to reduce the waste consequent upon action to the lowest possible degree; but to prevent it
entirely is beyond the power of man. Every breath of wind that passes over the surface of the
earth, modifies the bodies with which it comes in contact. The great toe of the bronze statue
of Saint Peter at Rome has been reduced, it is said, to less than half its original size by
the successive kisses of the faithful.

In dead or inanimate matter, the destructive influence of action is constantly forced upon
our attention by every thing passing around us, and so much human ingenuity is exercised to
counteract its effects that no reflecting person will dispute the universality of its operation.
But when we observe shrubs and trees waving in the wind, and animals undergoing violent exertion,
year after year, and continuing to increase in size, we may be inclined, on a superficial view,
to regard living bodies as constituting an exception to this rule. On more careful examination,
however, it will appear that waste goes on in living bodies not only without intermission,
but with a rapidity immeasurably beyond that which occurs in inanimate objects.

In the vegetable world, for instance, every leaf of a tree is incessantly pouring out some
of its fluids, and every flower forming its own fruit and seed, speedily to be separated from,
and lost to its parent stem; thus causing in a few months an extent of waste many hundred times
greater than what occurs in the same lapse of time after the tree is cut down, and all its
living operations are at a close.

The same thing holds true in the animal kingdom: so long as life continues, a copious exhalation
from the skin, the lungs, the bowels, and the kidneys goes on without a moment's intermission,
and not a movement can be performed which does not in some degree increase the circulation,
and add to the general waste. In this way, during violent exertion, several ounces of the fluids
of the body are sometimes thrown out by perspiration in a very few minutes; whereas, after
life is extinguished, all the excretions cease, and waste is limited to that which results
from ordinary chemical decomposition.[6]

  [6] For the views presented in the preceding paragraph (as also in
  several that follow) I would acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Andrew
  Combe's treatise on the "Physiology of Digestion." From the "Principles
  of Physiology," by the same author, I have already quoted. These
  admirable works will prove an invaluable treasure to persons desirous of
  becoming acquainted with the laws of health.

So far, then, the law that waste is attendant on action applies to both dead and living bodies;
but beyond this point a remarkable difference between them presents itself. In the physical
or inanimate world, what is once lost or worn away is lost forever; but living bodies, whether
vegetable or animal, possess the distinguishing characteristic of being able to repair their
own waste and add to their own substance. The possession of such a power is essential to their
existence. But there is a wide difference between them in other respects. In surveying the
respective modes of existence of vegetables and of animals, we perceive the fixity of position
of the one, and the free locomotive power of the other. The vegetable grows, flourishes, and
dies, fixed to the same spot of earth from which it sprang. However much external circumstances
change around it, it must remain and submit to their influence. At all hours and at all seasons,
it is at home, and in direct communication with the soil from which its nourishment is extracted.
But it is otherwise with animals: these not only enjoy the privilege of locomotion, but are
compelled to use it, and often to go a distance in search of food and shelter. The necessity
for a constant change of place being imposed on them, a different arrangement became indispensable
for their nutrition. The method which the Creator has provided is not less admirable than simple.
To enable animals to move about, and at the same time to maintain a connection with their food,
they are provided with a stomach. In this receptacle they can store up a supply of materials
from which sustenance may be gradually elaborated during a period of time proportioned to their
necessities and mode of life. Animals thus carry with them nourishment adequate to their wants;
and the small nutritive vessels imbibe their food from the internal surface of the stomach
and bowels, where it is stored up, just as the roots or nutritive vessels of vegetables do
from the soil in which they grow. The possession of a stomach or receptacle for food is accordingly
a distinguishing characteristic of the animal system.

The sole objects of nutrition being to repair waste and to admit of growth, the Creator has
so arranged that within certain limits it is always most vigorous when growth or waste proceeds
with the greatest rapidity. Even in vegetables this provision is distinctly observable. It
is also strikingly apparent in animals. Whenever growth is proceeding rapidly, or the animal
is undergoing much exertion and expenditure of material, an increased quantity of food is invariably
required. On the other hand, where no new substance is forming, and where, from bodily inactivity,
little loss is sustained, a comparatively small supply will suffice. In endowing animals with
the sense of appetite, including the sensation of hunger and thirst, the Creator has effectually
provided against any inconvenience which might otherwise exist, and given to them a guide in
relation to both the quality and quantity of food needful for them, and the times of partaking
of it, with that beneficence which distinguishes all his works. He has not only provided an
effectual safeguard in the sensations of hunger and thirst, but he has attached to their regulated
indulgence a degree of pleasure which never fails to insure attention to their demands, and
which, in highly-civilized communities, is apt to lead to excessive gratification. Their end
is manifestly to proclaim that nourishment is required for the support of the system. When
the body is very actively exercised, and a good deal of waste is effected by perspiration and
exhalation from the lungs, the appetite becomes keener, and more urgent for immediate gratification;
and if it is indulged, we eat with a relish unknown on other occasions, and afterward experience
a sensation of internal comfort pervading the frame, as if every individual part of the body
were imbued with a feeling of contentment and satisfaction; the very opposite of the restless
discomfort and depression which come upon us, and extend over the whole system, when appetite
is disappointed. There is, in short, an obvious and active sympathy between the condition and
bearing of the stomach, and those of every part of the animal frame; in virtue of which, hunger
is felt very keenly when the general system stands in urgent need of repair, and very moderately
when no waste has been suffered.

We have seen that waste is every where attendant upon action, and that the object of nutrition
is to repair waste and admit of growth. We come now to consider the Process of Digestion.

All articles used for food necessarily undergo several changes before they are fitted to constitute
a part of the body. In the process of digestion, four different changes should be noticed.
More might be specified.

1. MASTICATION.--The first step in the preparation of food for imparting nourishment to the
system consists in proper mastication, or chewing. Food should be thoroughly masticated before
it is taken into the stomach. This is necessary in order to break it up and reduce it to a
sufficient degree of fineness for the efficient action of the gastric juice. Besides, the action
of chewing and the presence of nutrient food constitute a healthful stimulus to the salivary
glands, situated in the mouth. By this means, also, the food not only becomes well masticated,
but has blended with it a proper amount of saliva, upon both of which conditions the healthy
action of the stomach depends. We have here another illustration of the beneficence of the
Creator, who has kindly so arranged that the very act of mastication gratifies taste, the mouth
being the seat of this sensation. But if we disregard these benevolent laws, and introduce
unmasticated food into the stomach, the gastric juice can act only upon its surface, and changes
of a purely chemical nature frequently commence in food thus swallowed before digestion can
take place. Hence frequently arise--and especially in children and persons of delicate constitution--pains,
nausea, and acidity, consequent on the continued presence of undigested aliment in the stomach.

2. CHYMIFICATION.--As soon as food has been thoroughly masticated and impregnated with saliva,
it is ready for transmission to the stomach. This interesting part of the process of digestion,
called deglutition or swallowing, is most easily and pleasantly performed, when the alimentary
morsel has been well masticated and properly softened, not by drink, which should never be
taken at this time, but by saliva. When the food reaches the stomach, it is converted into
a soft, pulpy mass, called chyme; and the process by which this change is effected is called
chymification. This is the second principal step in digestion, and is effected immediately
by the action of the gastric juice. This powerful solvent is secreted by the gastric glands,
which are excited to action by the presence of food in the stomach. In health, the gastric
secretion always bears a direct relation to the quantity of aliment required by the system.
If too much food is taken into the stomach, indigestion is sure to follow, for the sufficient
reason that the gastric juice is unable to dissolve it. This is true even when food has been
well masticated; but it becomes strikingly apparent when a full meal has been hastily swallowed,
both mastication and insalivation having been imperfectly performed.

The time usually occupied in the process of chymification, when food has been properly masticated,
varies from three to four hours. Digestion is sometimes effected in less time, as in the case
of rice, and pigs' feet soused; but it more commonly requires a longer period, as in the case
of salt pork and beef, and many other articles of food, both animal and vegetable.

By the alternate contraction and relaxation of the muscular coat of the stomach, which is excited
to action by the presence of food, a kind of churning motion is communicated to its contents
that greatly promotes digestion; for by this means every portion of food in turn is brought
in contact with the gastric juice as it is discharged from the internal surface of the stomach.
This motion continues until the contents of the stomach are converted into chyme, and conveyed
into the first intestine, where they undergo another important change.

3. CHYLIFICATION.--As fast as chyme is formed, it is expelled by the contractile power of the
stomach into the duodenum, or first intestine. It there meets with the bile from the liver,
and with the pancreatic juice. By the action of these agents, the chyme is converted into two
distinct portions: a milky white fluid, called chyle, and a thick yellow residue. This process
is called chylification, or chyle-making. The chyle is then taken up by the absorbent vessels,
which are extensively ramified over the inner membrane or lining of the bowels. From the white
color of the contents of these vessels, they have been named lacteals or milk-bearers, from
lac, which signifies milk. These lacteals ultimately converge into one trunk, called the thoracic
duct, which terminates in the great vein under the clavicle or collar bone, hence called the
subclavian vein, just before that vein reaches the right side of the heart. Here the chyle
is poured into the general current of the venous blood, and, mingling with it, is exposed to
the action of the air in the lungs during respiration. By this process, both the chyle and
the venous blood are converted into red, arterial, or nutritive blood, which is afterward distributed
by the heart through the arteries, to supply nourishment and support to every part of the body.
The change which takes place in the lungs is called sanguification, or blood-making. The chyle
is not prepared to impart nourishment to the system until this change takes place. Respiration,
then, is, in reality, the completion of digestion. This interesting and vital part of the process
of digestion will be considered more fully in the following chapter.

Before passing from this part of the subject, a few remarks of a more general nature seem called
for. The nerves of the stomach have a direct relation to undigested but digestible substances.
When any body that can not be digested is introduced into the stomach, distinct uneasiness
is speedily excited, and an effort is soon made to expel it, either upward by the mouth or
downward by the bowels. It is in this way, says Dr. Combe, that bile in the stomach excites
nausea, and that tartar emetic produces vomiting. The nerves of the bowels, on the other hand,
are constituted in relation to digested food; and, consequently, when any thing escapes into
them from the stomach in an undigested state, it becomes a source of irritative excitement.
This accounts for the cholic pains and bowel-complaints which so commonly attend the passage
through the intestinal canal of such indigestible substances as fat, husks of fruits, berries,
and cherry-stones.

The process of digestion, which commences in the stomach, is completed in the intestines. Physiologists
have hence sometimes called the former part of the process, or chymification, by the more simple
term stomach digestion; and the latter, or chylification, has been termed intestinal digestion.
The bowels have distinct coats corresponding with those of the stomach. By the alternate contraction
and relaxation of the muscular coat, their contents are propelled in a downward direction,
somewhat as motion is propagated from one end of a worm to the other. It has hence been called
vermicular, or wormlike motion. Some medicines have the power of inverting the order of the
muscular contractions. Emetics operate in this manner to produce vomiting. Other medicines,
again, excite the natural action to a higher degree, and induce a cathartic action of the bowels.
When medicines become necessary to obviate that kind of costiveness which arises from imperfect
intestinal contraction, physicians usually administer rhubarb, aloes, and similar laxatives,
combined with tonics. But when the muscular coat of the bowels is kept in a healthy condition
by a natural mode of life, and is aided by the action of the abdominal muscles, it rarely becomes
necessary to administer laxative medicines.

The inner or mucous coat of the stomach and bowels is generally regarded by physiologists as
a continuation of the skin. They greatly resemble each other in structure, and they are well
known to sympathize with each other. Eruptions of the skin are very generally the result of
disorders of the digestive organs. On the other hand, bowel complaints are frequently produced
by a chill on the surface. The mucous coat and the skin are both charged with the double function
of excretion and absorption. By the exercise of the former function, much of the waste matter
of the system, requiring to be removed, is thrown into the intestines, and, mingling with the
indigestible portion of the food, forms the common excrement; while by the exercise of the
latter function the nutritive portion of their contents is taken up, and, as we have seen,
passes into the general circulation, and contributes either to promote growth or to repair waste.

4. EVACUATION.--This is the fourth and last principal step in the process of digestion. After
the chyle is separated from the chyme and passes into the circulation, the indigestible and
refuse portion of the food, which is incapable of nourishing the system, passes off through
the intestinal canal. In its course its bulk is considerably increased by the excretion of
waste matter which has served its purposes in the system, and which, mingling with the innutritious
and refuse part of the food, is thrown out of the body in the form of excrement. If the contents
of the bowels are too long retained, uneasiness is produced. Hurtful matter, also, which should
pass off by evacuation, is reabsorbed, passes again into the general circulation, and is ultimately
thrown out of the system either by the lungs or through the pores of the skin.

This part of the process of digestion is very important, for it is impossible to enjoy good
health while this function is imperfectly performed. To secure full and natural action in the
intestinal canal, several principal conditions are necessary. These are, first, well-digested
chyme and chyle; second, a due quantity and quality of secretions from the mucous or lining
membrane of the bowels; third, a free and full contractile power of the muscular coat, and
the unrestrained action of the abdominal and respiratory muscles; and, finally, a due nervous
sensibility to receive impressions and communicate the necessary stimulus. The contractile
power of the muscular coat, and the free passage of the intestinal contents from the stomach
downward, are greatly aided by the constant but gentle agitation which the whole digestive
apparatus receives during the act of breathing, and from exercise of every description. By
free and deep inhalations of air into the lungs, the diaphragm is depressed and the bowels
are pushed down. But when the air is thrown out from the lungs, the diaphragm rises into the
chest, and the bowels follow, being pressed upward by the contractile power of the abdominal
muscles. During exercise, breathing is deeper and more free, which gives additional pressure
to the bowels from above. The abdominal muscular contraction is also, in turn, more vigorous
and extensive, and thus the motion is returned from below. Persons that take little or no exercise,
or who allow the chest and bowels to be confined by tight clothing, lose this natural stimulus,
and frequently become subjects of immense suffering from habits of costiveness. These should
be removed if possible, and they generally can be by a proper course of discipline. This should
have reference to both diet and exercise. Such articles of food should be used as tend to keep
open the bowels. This should be combined with the free exercise of the lungs and the abdominal
muscles. In addition to these, there should be a determination to secure a natural evacuation
of the bowels at least once a day. This is regarded by physiologists generally as essential
to health. Efforts should be continued until the habit is established. Some definite period
should be fixed upon for this purpose. Soon after breakfast is, on many accounts, generally
preferable.

TIME FOR MEALS.--Before passing from the subject of digestion, I will submit a few thoughts
in relation to the times for eating. It has already been observed that three or four hours
are generally necessary for the digestion of a simple meal. Usually, perhaps, a greater length
of time is required. It is also an established doctrine, based upon the results of careful
examination and experiment, that the stomach requires an interval of rest, after the process
of digestion is finished, to enable it to recover its tone before it can again enter upon the
vigorous performance of its function. As a general rule, then, five or six hours should elapse
between meals. If the mode of life is indolent, a greater time is required; if active, less
time will suffice. Where the usages of society will allow the principal meal to be taken near
the middle of the day, the following time for meals is approved by physiologists generally:
breakfast at 7 o'clock, dinner at half past 12, and tea at 6. Luncheons and late suppers should
be avoided; for the former will always be found to interfere with the healthful performance
of the function of digestion, and the latter will induce restlessness, unpleasant dreams, and
pain in the head. "A late supper," says the author of the Philosophy of Health, "generally
occasions deranged and disturbed sleep; there is an effort on the part of the nerves to be
quiet, while the burdened stomach makes an effort to call them into action, and between these
two contending efforts there is disturbance--a sort of gastric riot--during the whole night.
This disturbance has sometimes terminated in a fit of apoplexy and in death."

THE SKIN.--This membranous covering, which is spread over the surface of the body to shield
the parts beneath, serves also as an excreting and secreting organ. By the great supply of
blood which it receives, it is admirably fitted for this purpose. The whole animal system,
as we have seen, is in a state of transition, decay and renovation constantly succeeding each
other. While the stomach and alimentary canal take in new materials, the skin forms one of
the principal outlets by which particles that are useless to the system are thrown out of the
body. Every one knows that the skin perspires, and that checked perspiration is a powerful
cause of disease and death; but few have any just notion of the extent and influence of this
exhalation. When the body is overheated by exercise, a copious sweat breaks out, which, by
evaporation, carries off the excess of heat, and produces an agreeable feeling of coolness
and refreshment. The sagacity of Franklin led him to the first discovery of the use of perspiration
in reducing the heat of the body, and to point out the analogy subsisting between this process
and that of the evaporation of water from a rough porous surface, so constantly resorted to
in the East and West Indies, and in other warm countries, as an efficacious means of reducing
the temperature of the air in rooms, and of wine and other drinks, much below that of the surrounding
atmosphere. This is the higher and more obvious degree of the function of exhalation. But in
the ordinary state of the system, the skin is constantly giving out a large quantity of waste
materials by what is called insensible perspiration; a process which is of great importance
to the preservation of health, and which is called insensible, because the exhalation, being
in the form of vapor, and carried off by the surrounding air, is invisible to the eye. But
its presence may often be made manifest, even to the sight, by the near approach of a dry cool
mirror, on the surface of which it will soon be condensed so as to become visible. It is this
which causes so copious deposits upon the windows of a crowded school-room in cold weather.
A portion of these exhalations, however, proceed from the lungs.

There is an experiment that may be easily tried, which affords conclusive evidence that the
amount of insensible perspiration is much greater than it is ordinarily supposed to be. Take
a dry glass jar, with a neck three or four inches in diameter, and thrust the hand and a part
of the fore-arm into it, closing the space in the neck about the arm with a handkerchief. After
the lapse of a few minutes, it will be seen, by drawing the fingers across the inside of the
jar, that the insensible perspiration even from the hand is very considerable. Many attempts
have been made to estimate accurately the amount of exhaled matter carried off through the
skin; but many difficulties stand in the way of obtaining precise results. There is a great
difference in different constitutions, and even in the same person at different times, in consequence
of which we must be satisfied with an approximation to the truth.

Although the precise amount of perspiration can not be ascertained, it is generally agreed
that the cutaneous exhalation is greater than the united excretions of both bowels and kidneys.
Great attention has been given to this subject. Sanctorius, a celebrated medical writer, weighed
himself, his food, and his excretions, daily, for thirty days. He inferred from his experiments
that five pounds of every eight, of both food and drink, taken into the system, pass out through
the skin. All physiologists agree that from twenty to forty ounces pass off through the skin
of an adult in usual health every twenty-four hours. Take the lowest estimate, and we find
the skin charged with the removal of twenty ounces of waste matter from the system every day.
We can thus see ample reason why checked perspiration proves so detrimental to health; for
every twenty-four hours during which such a state continues, we must either have this amount
of useless and hurtful matter accumulating in the system, or some of the other organs of excretion
must be greatly overtasked, which obviously can not happen without disturbing their regularity
and well-being. It is generally known that continued exposure in a cold day produces either
a bowel complaint or inflammation of some internal organ. Instead of expressing surprise at
this, if people generally understood the structure and uses of their own bodies, they would
rather wonder why one or the other of these effects is not always attendant upon so great a
violation of the laws of health, which are the laws of God.

The lungs also excrete a large proportion of waste matter from the system. So far, then, their
office is similar to that of the kidneys, the liver, and the bowels. In consequence of this
alliance with the skin, these parts are more intimately connected with each other, in both
healthy and diseased action, than with other organs. Whenever an organ is unusually delicate,
it will be more easily affected by any cause of disease than those which are sound. Thus, in
one instance, checked perspiration may produce a bowel complaint, and in another, inflammation
of the lungs, and so on. Hence the fitness, in prescribing remedies, of adapting them not only
to the disease itself, but of taking into the account the cause of the disease. A bowel complaint,
for example, may arise either from overeating or from a check to perspiration. The thing to
be cured is the same in both cases, but the means of cure ought obviously to be different.
In one instance, an emetic or laxative, to carry off the offending cause, would be the most
rational and efficacious remedy; in the other, a diaphoretic should be administered, to open
the skin and restore it to a healthy action. Facts like these expose the ignorance and impudence
of the quack, who undertakes to cure every form of disease by one remedy.

It has already been remarked that the skin is charged with the double function of excretion
and absorption. We have a striking illustration of the exercise of the latter function in the
vaccination of children and others, to protect them from small-pox. A small quantity of cow-pox
matter is inserted under the external layer of the skin, where it is acted upon, and in a short
time taken into the system by the absorbent vessels. In like manner, when the perspiration
is brought to the surface of the skin, and confined there, either by injudicious clothing or
by want of cleanliness, there is much reason to believe that its residual parts are again absorbed.
It is established by observation that concentrated animal effluvia form a very energetic poison.
We can, then, see why the absorption of the residual parts of perspiration produces fever,
inflammation, and even death itself, according to its quantity and degree of concentration.
This leads me to notice the importance of

BATHING.--The exhalation from the skin being so constant and extensive, and the bad effects
of it when confined being so great, it becomes very important that we provide for its removal.
This can be most easily and effectually accomplished by frequently bathing the whole body.
This is a luxury within the reach of all, but one which is unappreciated by those who have
not enjoyed it. An aged gentleman said to me recently, that in early life he "used to go a
swimming frequently and enjoyed it much; but," he added, "I have not bathed or washed myself
all over for the last thirty years!" This, it is believed, is an extreme case. But it is to
be feared there are not wanting instances in which persons do not bathe the entire person once
a month, or once a year even! When the residual parts of the perspiration are not removed by
washing or bathing, they at last obstruct the pores and irritate the skin. It is apparently
for this reason that, in the Eastern and warmer countries, where perspiration is very copious,
ablution and bathing have assumed the rank and importance of religious observances. Those who
are in the habit of using the flesh-brush daily are at first surprised at the quantity of white
dry scurf which it brings off; and those who take a warm bath for half an hour at long intervals
can not have failed to notice the great amount of impurities which it removes, and the grateful
feeling of comfort which its use imparts. It is remarked by an eminent physician, that the
warm, tepid, cold, or shower bath, as a means of preserving health, ought to be in as common
use as a change of apparel, for it is equally a measure of necessary cleanliness. Many, no
doubt, neglect this, and enjoy health notwithstanding; but many more suffer from its omission;
and even the former would be greatly benefited by employing it. Cleanliness, then, is as essential
to health as to decency. Still more, it promotes not only physical health, but contributes
largely to strengthen and invigorate the intellectual faculties, and to elevate and purify
the affections. It comes, then, to be ranked among the cardinal virtues.

To secure the benefits of bathing or ablution, a great amount of apparatus is not necessary.
A shower-bath, or plunge-bath, may not be best for all. Every one can procure a wash-bowl and
one or two quarts of water, which are all that is necessary. To prevent the reduction of heat
in the system by evaporation, and especially in cold weather, it will usually be found best
to bathe the body by sections. It is generally agreed that the morning is the best time for
bathing. Immediately on rising, then, the clothing being removed, let the head, face, and neck
be washed as usual, and thoroughly dried by the use of a towel. Proceed to wash the chest and
abdomen, which may be dried as before, after which a coarse towel or a flesh-brush should be
vigorously applied, until the skin is perfectly dry, and there is a pleasant glow upon the
surface. The back and limbs, in turn, should be washed, dried, and excited to a healthy and
pleasant glow by friction. This last is of the utmost importance. If not easily secured, salt
or vinegar may be added to the water, both of which are excellent stimulants to the skin.[7]
When these are used, and care is taken to excite in the surface, by subsequent friction with
a coarse towel, flesh-brush, or hair glove, the healthful glow of reaction, it will be found
to contribute largely to both physical and mental comfort. The beneficial results will be more
apparent if, while bathing and rubbing the chest and abdomen, pains are taken to throw back
the shoulders, expand the lungs, and enlarge the chest.

  [7] It will frequently be found more convenient, and will be well-nigh
  as serviceable, to wash in soft water as usual, and excite a reaction in
  the skin in the use of a towel that has been dipped in brine and dried.

By an act of the Legislature of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, passed in April last, it
is required that "physiology and hygiene shall hereafter be taught in the schools of that commonwealth,
in all cases in which the school committee shall deem it expedient."

When physiology is not made a study in school, the teacher should not fail to give familiar
and instructive lectures on the subject. I know of instances where, by this simple means, the
habits of a whole school, composed of several hundred youth of both sexes, have been radically
changed; and the practice of daily ablution has ceased to be the luxury of the few, having
become the necessity not only of teachers and scholars, but of the families in which they reside.
There is the most satisfactory evidence that cleanliness is conducive to health.[8] How important
it is, then, that habits of cleanliness be formed at an early age.

  [8] The friends of educational reform may well take courage from the
  increased attention which the subject of physical education is of late
  receiving from the pulpit and the press, those mighty conservators
  of the public weal. Since the text was prepared for the press, the
  following remarks and pertinent inquiry have appeared in the Family
  Favorite for February, 1850. They are quoted from a Discourse by the
  editor, the Rev. James V. Watson, on the First Sabbath of the New Year:

  "The true interpretation of the providence of God in Asiatic cholera
  perhaps has never yet fully been given. Is it not one of God's marked
  modes of rebuking intemperance, physical uncleanness, and social
  degradation--evils which result from perverted appetite, wrong forms of
  government, and a want of Christian benevolence? The reformer, the
  philanthropist, and the Christian may learn a lesson here."

Dr. Weiss, a distinguished German physician, in his remarks on this subject, says, the best
time, undoubtedly, for these ablutions, is the morning. They are to be performed immediately
after rising from the bed, when the temperature of the body is raised by the heat of the bed.
The sudden change favors in a great measure the reaction which ensues, and excites the skin,
rendered more sensitive by the perspiration during the night, to renewed activity. Cold ablutions,
he adds, are fitted for all constitutions; they are best adapted for purifying and strengthening
the body; for women, weak subjects, children, and old age. The room in which the ablution is
performed may be slightly heated for debilitated patients in winter, to prevent colds in consequence
of too low a temperature of the apartment; this exception is, however, only admissible for
very weakly persons. Generally speaking, ablutions may be performed in a cold room, especially
where persons get through the operation quickly, and can immediately afterward take exercise
in the open air.

It is the opinion of Dr. Combe that bathing is a safe and valuable preservative of health,
in ordinary circumstances, and an active remedy in disease. Instead of being dangerous by causing
liability to cold, it is, he says, when well managed, so much the reverse, that he has used
it much and successfully for the express purpose of diminishing such liability, both in himself
and in others in whom the chest is delicate. In his own instance, in particular, he is conscious
of having derived much advantage from its regular employment, especially in the colder months
of the year, during which he has found himself most effectually strengthened against the impression
of cold by repeating the bath at shorter intervals than usual. I shall conclude my remarks
on bathing by presenting a paragraph from this transatlantic author.

If the bath can not be had at all places, soap and water may be obtained every where, and leave
no apology for neglecting the skin. If the constitution be delicate, water and vinegar, or
water and salt, used daily, form an excellent and safe means of cleansing and gently stimulating
the skin. To the invalid they are highly beneficial, when the nature of the indisposition does
not render them improper. A rough and rather coarse towel is a very useful auxiliary in such
ablutions. Few of those who have steadiness to keep up the action of the skin by the above
means, and to avoid strong and exciting causes, will ever suffer from colds, sore throats,
or similar complaints; while, as a means of restoring health, they are often incalculably serviceable.
If one tenth of the persevering attention and labor bestowed to so much purpose in rubbing
down and currying the skins of horses were bestowed by the human race in keeping themselves
in good condition, and a little attention were paid to diet and clothing, colds, nervous diseases,
and stomach complaints would cease to form so large an item in the catalogue of human miseries.
Man studies the nature of other animals, and adapts his conduct to their constitution; himself
alone he continues ignorant of and neglects. He considers himself a being of superior order,
and not subject to the laws of organization which regulate the functions of the lower animals;
but this conclusion is the result of ignorance and pride, and not a just inference from the
premises on which it is ostensibly founded.

CLOTHING.--The skin is very materially affected in the healthy performance of its functions
by the nature and condition of the clothing. It is a very commonly received opinion that one
principal object in clothing is to impart heat to the body. This, however, is an erroneous
idea; the utmost that it can do is to prevent the escape of heat. All articles of clothing
are not alike in this respect. Some conduct the heat from the body readily, and are hence much
used in warm weather; as linen, for example. Others, again, have very little tendency to convey
heat from the body, and are hence sought in cold weather. Of this nature are furs, and cloths
manufactured from wool. I do not intend in this connection to speak of the merits of different
kinds of clothing, but to remark simply upon the necessity of changing clothes often, or at
least of ventilating them frequently. This remark applies particularly to all articles of clothing
worn next to the skin, and to beds. Clothes worn next to the skin during the day should be
removed on going to bed, and a fresh sleeping-gown should be put on. The former should be hung
up in a situation that will allow the accumulated perspiration of the day to pass off by evaporation.
By this means they will become sufficiently freshened and ventilated, by morning, to be worn
another day, when the night-clothes, in turn, should be ventilated. Beds also should be thrown
open and exposed to fresh air with open doors, or at least windows, several hours before being
made. In our best-regulated boarding schools, and literary and benevolent institutions of all
kinds, particular attention is now paid to this subject. In some instances, lodging rooms are
furnished with frames for the express purpose of facilitating the ventilation of the bed-clothes.
Immediately on rising in the morning, the clothes are removed from the beds, and exposed upon
these frames to a current of fresh air for several hours, the windows being opened for that
purpose. Notwithstanding care be taken to promote personal cleanliness by daily ablutions,
if the ventilation of beds and clothing be neglected, and perspiration be suffered to accumulate
in them, it may be reabsorbed, and, passing again into the circulation, produce all the mischief
of which I have before spoken.

THE TEETH.--I have already spoken of the relation the teeth sustain to digestion. Their use
in the proper mastication of food is essential to the healthy and vigorous performance of this
important function. The proper use of a good set of teeth contributes largely to both the physical
comfort, and the intellectual and moral well-being of their possessor; but when neglected,
they very commonly decay and become useless; nay, more, they are not unfrequently a source
of great and almost constant discomfort for years. In order to preserve the teeth, they must
be kept clean. After every meal, they should be cleaned with a brush and water. A tooth-pick
will sometimes be found necessary in the removal of particles of food that are inaccessible
to the brush. Metallic tooth-picks injure the enamel, and should not be used. Those made of
ivory, or the common goose-quill, are unobjectionable. The brush should be used, not only after
each meal, but the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning. This will prevent
the accumulation of tartar, which so commonly incrusts neglected teeth. If suffered to remain,
it gradually accumulates, presses upon the gums, and destroys their health. By this means the
roots of the teeth become bare, and thus deprived of their natural stimulus, they prematurely
decay. Food or drink either very hot or very cold is exceedingly injurious to the teeth. Sour
drops, acidulated drinks, and all articles of food that "set the teeth on edge," are injurious,
and should be carefully avoided. Should it become necessary to take sour drops as a medicine,
they should be given through a quill, and every precaution should be taken to prevent their
coming in contact with the teeth. Even then the mouth should be well rinsed immediately after
they are swallowed.

Disordered digestion is a great source of injury to the teeth both in childhood and in mature
age. When digestion is vigorous, there is less deposition of tartar, and the teeth are naturally
of a purer white. Especially is this true when the general health is good, and the diet plain,
and contains a full proportion of vegetable matter. This accounts for the fact that many rustics
and savages possess teeth that would be envied in town. Tobacco is sometimes used as a preservative
of the teeth. It is, indeed, occasionally prescribed as a curative by ignorant physicians,
and those who are willing to pander to the diseased appetites of their patients. But there
is the best medical testimony that the use of this filthy weed "debilitates the vessels of
the gums, turns the teeth yellow, and renders the appearance of the mouth disagreeable." Dr.
Rush informs us that he knew a man in Philadelphia who lost all his teeth by smoking. In speaking
of the moral effects of this practice, he adds, "Smoking and chewing tobacco, by rendering
water and other simple liquors insipid to the taste, dispose very much to the stronger stimulus
of ardent spirits; hence the practice of smoking cigars throughout our country has been followed
by the use of brandy and water as a common drink." A dentist of extensive and successful practice
in the Middle and Western States, after listening to the reading of this article, said to me,
he had a patient, a young lady, two of whose front teeth had decayed through, laterally, in
consequence of smoking. On removing the caries, he found it impossible to fill her teeth, because
the openings continued through them. He thinks, as do many others, that the heat of the smoke
is a principal cause of the injury.

Among the conditions upon which the healthy action of the voluntary organs depends is a due
degree of appropriate exercise. This is a general law, and holds with reference to the teeth
as well as to any other organ or set of organs. The proper mastication of healthful and nutritious
food constitutes the appropriate exercise of the teeth, and is a condition upon which their
health, and the healthy exercise of the function of digestion, alike depend. If from any cause
the teeth of one jaw are removed, the corresponding teeth of the other jaw, being thus deprived
of that exercise which is essential to their health, are pressed out of the jaw, appear to
grow long, become loose in their sockets, and sometimes fall out. Hence the propriety and advantage
of inserting artificial teeth where the natural ones fail; an event which rarely happens when
they are properly taken care of. I need hardly add that nuts, and other hard substances that
break the enamel, are injurious to the teeth, and should be avoided.

THE BONES.--The bones constitute the frame-work of the system. They consist of two substances,
being formed of both animal and earthy matter. To the former belongs every thing connected
with their life and growth, while the latter gives to them solidity and strength. The proportions
of the animal and earthy elements of which the bones are composed vary at different ages. In
childhood and early youth, when but little strength is needed, and great growth of bone is
required, the animal part preponderates. As growth advances the animal part decreases, and
the earthy part increases. In middle life, when growth is finished and the strength is greatest,
and when nutrition is required only to repair waste, the proportions are changed, and the solid
or earthy part exceeds the vital or animal; and in extreme old age, the earthy part so predominates
as to cause the bones to become very brittle.

The bones, like other parts of the system, require exercise. If properly used, they increase
in size and strength. But while a due degree of exercise is beneficial, it ought to be remarked
that severe and continued labor should not be required of children and youth; for its tendency
is to increase the deposition of earthy matter to a hurtful extent. It is by this means that
many children are made dwarfs for life, their bones being consolidated by an undue amount of
exercise and excessive labor before they have attained their full growth. Multitudes of children
in our country, from this and kindred causes, fail of attaining the size of their ancestors.
These remarks may be turned to a practical account in the family and in the school. At birth,
many of the bones are scarcely more than cartilage; yet children are frequently urged to stand
and walk long before the bones become sufficiently strong to sustain the pressure; and, as
a consequence, their legs become crooked, and they are perhaps other ways deformed for life.
Children ought always, when seated, to be able to rest their feet upon the floor. When they
occupy a seat that is too high, and especially when they are unable to reach their feet to
the floor, the thigh bones very frequently become curved. If, in addition to high seats, the
back is not supported, children become round shouldered, their chests contract, their constitutions
become permanently enfeebled, and they become peculiarly susceptible to pulmonary disease.
The back to the seat should afford a pleasant and agreeable support to the small of the back,
but it ought not to reach to the shoulder blades.

Parents and teachers should never forget that children are as susceptible to physical training
as to intellectual or moral culture. And here, especially, they should be "trained up in the
way they should go." Physical uprightness is next to moral. If children are allowed to contract
bad physical habits, they are liable not only to grow crooked, but to become deformed in various
ways. But so great is the power of education, that by it even the physically crooked may be
made straight; the chest may be enlarged, the general health may be improved, and much may
be done in many ways to fortify those who have inherited feeble constitutions against the attacks
of disease. The benefits resulting from maintaining an upright form, and a free and open chest,
have already been considered, and I shall have occasion to refer to them again. The chest of
most adults, although incased with bone, may be increased several inches by drawing the arms
back in the use of nature's own shoulder-braces, and at the same time taking deep inhalations
of air, and filling the lungs to their utmost capacity. Hundreds of individuals in different
parts of the country have borne testimony to the efficacy of this treatment in the improvement
of their health. The good results of such discipline in childhood are still more manifest.

A stooping posture is frequently induced by sitting at tables and desks that are too low. It
has been erroneously maintained by some that the top of the desk should be on the same plane
with the elbow when the arm hangs by the side. When the desk is higher, it has been said the
tendency is to elevate one shoulder, to depress the other, and to produce a permanent curvature
of the spinal column. Although this may have been frequently the result of sitting at a high
desk, yet it is not a necessary result. To prevent the projection of one shoulder, and the
consequent spinal curvature, both of the arms must be kept on the same level. For this purpose,
there should be room to support them equally; and care should be taken to see that this support
is regularly sought. If this be not done, the right arm will be apt to rise above the left,
from its more constant use and elevation. A physician, highly celebrated for the success that
has attended his treatment for lung affections, after dwelling upon the injury to the health
that frequently results from sitting at too low desks, remarks, that "every parent should go
to the school-rooms, and know for a certainty that the desks at which his children write or
study are fully up to the arm-pits, and in no case allow them to sit stooping, or leaning the
shoulders forward on the chest. If fatigued by this posture, they should be called to stand,
or go out of doors and run about." The height of table I find most conducive to comfort for
my own use is midway between the two; that is, half way from the elbow (as the arm hangs by
the side) to the arm-pit. It is necessary, however, to rest both arms equally upon the table.
The secret of posture consists in avoiding all bad positions, and in not continuing any one
position too long. The ordinary carriage of the body is an object worthy of the attention of
every parent and instructor. The more favorable impression which a man of erect and commanding
attitude is sure to make, should not be overlooked. But there is a greater good than this;
for he who walks erect, enjoys better health, possesses increased powers of usefulness, realizes
more that he is a man, and has more to call forth gratitude to a beneficent Creator, than he
who adopts an oblique posture. It was just remarked that "physical uprightness is next to moral."
Physical obliquity, it may be added, is akin to moral. If they are not German-cousins, there
can be little doubt but that, considered in all its bearings, the tendency of the former is
to induce the latter.

Important as an erect posture and a well-developed chest are to gentlemen, they are in some
respects even more so to the fairer sex; for, in addition to the advantages already considered,
which both enjoy in common, these impart to them a peculiar charm, that to men of sense is
far greater than pretty faces, which Nature has not given to all. "For a great number of years,
it has been the custom in France to give young females, of the earliest age, the habit of holding
back the shoulders, and thus expanding the chest. From the observations of anatomists lately
made, it appears that the clavicle or collar bone is actually longer in females of the French
nation than in those of the English. As the two nations are of the same race, as there is no
remarkable difference in their bones, and this is peculiar to the sex, it must be attributed,
as I believe, to the habit above mentioned, which, by the extension of the arms, has gradually
produced an elongation of this bone. Thus we see that habit may be employed to alter and improve
the solid bones.

THE MUSCLES.--The muscles consist of compact bundles of fleshy fibers, which are found in animals
on removing the skin. They constitute the red fleshy part of meat, and give form and symmetry
to the body. In the limbs they surround and protect the bones, while in the trunk they spread
out and constitute a defensive wall for the protection of the vital parts beneath. The muscles
have been divided into three parts, of which the middle and fleshy portion, called the belly,
is most conspicuous. The other two parts are the opposite ends, and are commonly called the
origin and insertion of the muscle. The origin is usually fastened to one bone, and the insertion
is attached to another. By the contraction of the belly of the muscle, the insertion, which
is movable, is drawn toward the origin, which is fixed, and brings with it the bone to which
it is attached. This any one can see illustrated in bending the arm. The muscle which performs
this function lies between the elbow and the shoulder. It is attached to the shoulder by its
origin, and to one of the bones of the fore-arm, just below the elbow, by its insertion. By
grasping the arm midway between the shoulder and the elbow with the opposite hand, and then
bending the arm, the enlargement of the belly of the muscle by the contraction will be at once
perceived. Then, by moving the hand down on the inside of the arm toward the elbow, the lessening
muscle may be readily traced until it terminates in a tendon, of much less size than the muscle,
but of great strength, which is inserted into the bone just below the elbow. As the fore-arm
is drawn up, and especially if there be a weight in the hand, the tendon may be felt just within
the elbow-joint, running toward the point of insertion. Extend the arm at the elbow, and the
muscle on the outside of the arm will swell and become firm, while the inside muscle, and its
tendon at the elbow, will be relaxed. This example well illustrates the principle on which
all the joints of the system are moved. Those who are acquainted with mechanics will readily
perceive that the action just described is an example of the "third kind of lever," where the
power is applied between the weight and the fulcrum. The elbow is the fulcrum, the hand contains
the weight, and the tendon, inserted into the bone just below the elbow, is the power. This
kind of lever requires the power to be greater than the weight, and acts under what is called
a mechanical disadvantage. What is lost in power, however, is compensated in increased velocity.

There are upward of four hundred muscles in the human body. Some of these are voluntary in
their motions, as those I have described, while others are involuntary, as the action of the
heart and the respiratory muscles. Had the action of these depended upon the will, as does
the action of the muscles of locomotion, the circulation of the blood and the process of breathing
would cease, and life would become extinct whenever sleep or any other cause should overcome
the attention. Here, then, we have another beautiful illustration of the wisdom and beneficence
of the Creator in so ordering that those muscles which are essential to the continuation of
life shall perform their functions without the control or attention of the individual.

The study of the muscular system involves an exposition of the principles by which exercise
should be regulated, and can scarcely fail to excite the attention of the general reader, and
especially of those who, as parents or teachers, are interested in the education of the young.

The muscles enable us to move the frame-work of the system. Their chief purpose obviously is
to enable us to carry into effect the various resolutions and designs which have been formed
by the mind. But, while fulfilling this grand object, their active exercise is, at the same
time, highly conducive to the well-being of many other important functions. By muscular contraction,
the blood is gently assisted in its course through the smaller vessels to the more distant
parts of the body; and by it the important processes of digestion, respiration, secretion,
absorption, and nutrition are promoted; and by it the health of the whole body is immediately
and greatly influenced. The mind itself is exhilarated or depressed by the proper or improper
use of muscular exercise. It thus becomes a point of no slight importance to establish general
principles by which that exercise may be regulated.

In every part of the animal economy, the muscles are proportioned in size and structure to
the efforts required of them. Whenever a muscle is called into frequent use, its fibers increase
in thickness within certain limits, and become capable of acting with greater force and readiness.
On the other hand, when a muscle is little used, its volume and power decrease in a corresponding
degree.

In order to secure the most beneficial results from exercise, reference should be had to the
time at which it is taken. Those who are in perfect health may engage in it at almost any hour
except immediately after a meal; but those who are not robust ought to confine their hours
of exercise within narrower limits. To a person in full vigor, a good walk, or other brisk
exercise before breakfast may be highly beneficial and exhilarating, while to an invalid or
delicate person it will be likely to prove detrimental. In order to prove beneficial, exercise
must be resorted to only when the system is sufficiently vigorous to be able to meet it. This
is usually the case after a lapse of from two to four hours after a moderate meal. The forenoon,
then, will generally be found the best time for exercise for persons whose habits are sedentary.
If exercise be delayed till the system feels exhaustion from want of food, its tendency will
be to dissipate the strength that remains and impair digestion; while, if taken at the proper
time, it will invigorate the system and promote digestion. The reasons are obvious; for exercise
of every kind causes increased action and waste in the organ, and if there be not materials
and vigor enough in the system to keep up that action and supply the waste, nothing but increased
debility can reasonably be expected.

Active exercise immediately before meals is injurious. The reasons are apparent, for muscular
exercise directs a flow of blood and nervous energy to the surface and extremities; and it
is an established law in physiology, that energetic action can not be kept up in two distant
parts of the system at the same time. Hence, whenever a meal is taken immediately after vigorous
exercise, the stomach is taken at disadvantage, and, from want of the necessary action in its
vessels and nerves, is unable to carry on digestion with success. This is very obviously the
case where the exercise has been severe or protracted.

Active exercise ought to be equally avoided immediately after a heavy meal, for then the functions
of the digestive organs are in the highest state of activity. If the muscular system be called
into vigorous action under such circumstances, it will cause a withdrawal of the vital stimuli
of the blood and nervous influence from the stomach to the extremities, which can not fail
greatly to retard the digestive process. In accordance with this well-established fact, there
is a natural and marked aversion to active pursuits after a full meal. A mere stroll, which
requires no exertion and does not fatigue, will not be injurious before or after eating; but
exercise beyond this limit is at such times hurtful. All, therefore, who would preserve and
improve their health, will find it to their advantage to observe faithfully this important
law, otherwise they will deprive themselves of most of the benefits that are usually attendant
upon judicious exercise. All, then, who are forced to much exertion immediately after eating,
should satisfy themselves with partaking of a very moderate meal. These remarks apply to both
physical and mental exercise; for if the intellect be intently occupied in profound and absorbing
thought, the nervous energy will be concentrated in the brain, and any demands made on it by
the stomach or muscles will be very imperfectly attended to. So, also, if the stomach be actively
engaged in digesting a full meal, and some subject of thought be presented to the mind, considerable
difficulty will be felt in pursuing it, and most probably both thought and digestion will be
disturbed.

Another law of the muscular system requires that relaxation and contraction should alternate;
or, in other words, that rest should follow exercise. In accordance with this law, it is easier
to walk than to stand; and in standing, it is easier to change from one foot to the other than
to stand still. To require a child to extend his arm and hold a book in his hand, or even to
keep the arm extended but a short time, is a violation of this law which should never be permitted.
Akin to this is the very injudicious practice, which is sometimes resorted to in schools, of
requiring a boy to stoop over, and, placing his finger upon a nail in the floor, "hold it in."
Teachers who are disposed to inflict punishments like these ought first to try the experiment
themselves. Such protracted tension of the muscles enfeebles their action, and ultimately destroys
their power of contraction.

These remarks sufficiently explain why small children, after sitting a while in school, become
restless. Proper regard for this organic law requires that the smaller children in school be
allowed a recess as often, at least, as once an hour; and that all be allowed and encouraged
frequently to change their position. I fully concur in the opinion expressed by Dr. Caldwell,
who says, "It would be infinitely wiser and better to employ suitable persons to superintend
the exercises and amusements of children under seven years of age, in the fields, orchards,
and meadows, and point out to them the richer beauties of nature, than to have them immured
in crowded school-rooms, in a state of inaction, poring over torn books and primers, conning
words of whose meaning they are ignorant, and breathing foul air."

A change of position calls into action a different set of muscles, and relieves those that
are exhausted. The object of exercise is to employ all the muscles of the body, and especially
to strengthen those that are weak. It ought hence to be frequently varied, and always adapted
to the peculiarities of individuals. Different kinds of exercise will therefore be found to
suit different constitutions. Sedentary persons best enjoy, and will be most profited by, that
kind of exercise which brings into action the greatest number of muscles.

To give exercise its greatest value, it should be taken at the same hour every day. This is
well-nigh as important as the rule that requires meals to be taken regularly. If exercise be
taken irregularly, one day in the morning, another day at noon, and another day at night, if
at all, it is possible that good may result from it, but its beneficial effects would be greatly
increased if the same amount of exercise were taken every day at the same hours. Give the system
an opportunity of establishing good habits in this respect, and it will derive great advantage
from them; but it is difficult for it to derive any benefit from a habit of irregularity, if
such may be called a habit. Students, teachers, and all persons who lead sedentary lives, should
have their regular times for exercise as well as for meals, and if they find it necessary to
do without one, they will generally find it advantageous to dispense with the other also.

Walking, it has been said, agrees with every body. But as it brings into play chiefly the lower
limbs and muscles of the loins, and affords little scope for the play of the arms and muscles
of the chest, it is of itself insufficient to constitute adequate exercise. To render it most
beneficial, the shoulders should be drawn back, and the chest should be enlarged by taking
deep inspirations of pure air. The muscles of the chest, and of every part of the body, should
be free to move and unconfined by tight clothing. Fencing, shuttlecock, and such other useful
sports as combine with them free movements of the upper part of the body, are doubly advantageous,
for they not only exercise the muscles of the whole body, but possess the additional advantage
of animating the mind and increasing the nervous stimulus, by which exercise is rendered easy,
pleasant, and invigorating. For the purpose of developing the chest, physiologists generally
concur in recommending fencing as a good exercise for boys. Shuttlecock is a very beneficial
exercise for females, calling into play, as it does, the muscles of the chest, trunk, and arms.
It ought to be practiced in the open air. When played with both hands, as it may be after a
little practice, it is very useful in preventing curvature, and in giving vigor to the spine.
It is an excellent plan to play with a battledore in each hand, and to strike with them alternately.
The graces is another play well adapted for expanding the chest, and giving strength to the
muscles of the back, and has the advantage of being practicable in the open air. It is very
important that the muscles of the back be strengthened by due exercise, for their proper use
contributes to both health and beauty.

When managed with due regard to the natural powers of the individual, and so as to avoid effort
and fatigue, reading aloud becomes a very useful and invigorating exercise. In forming and
undulating the voice, not only the chest, but also the diaphragm and abdominal muscles are
in constant action, and communicate to the stomach and bowels a healthy and agreeable stimulus.
Where the voice is raised and the elocution is rapid, the muscular effort becomes fatiguing;
but when care is taken not to carry reading aloud so far at one time as to excite a sensation
of soreness or fatigue in the chest, and the exercise is duly repeated, it is extremely useful
in developing and giving tone to the organs of respiration and to the general system.

"Vocal music is also very useful, by its direct effect on the constitution. It was the opinion
of Dr. Rush, that young ladies especially, who, by the custom of society, are debarred from
many kinds of salubrious exercise, should cultivate singing, not only as an accomplishment,
but as a means of preserving health. He particularly insists that it should never be neglected
in the education of females; and states that, besides its salutary operation in enabling them
to soothe the cares of domestic life, and quiet sorrow by the united assistance of the sound
and sentiment of a properly chosen song, it has a still more direct and important effect. 'I
here introduce a fact,' he remarks, 'which has been suggested to me by my profession, and that
is, that the exercise of the organs of the breast by singing contributes very much to defend
them from those diseases to which the climate and other causes expose them. The Germans are
seldom afflicted with consumption, nor have I ever known but one instance of spitting blood
among them. This, I believe, is in part occasioned by the strength which their lungs acquire
by exercising them frequently in vocal music, for this constitutes an essential branch of their
education. The music-master of our academy has furnished me with an observation still more
in favor of this opinion. He informed me that he had known several instances of persons who
were strongly disposed to consumption, who were restored to health by the exercise of their
lungs in singing.'"[10]

  [10] Mr. Woodbridge's lecture before the American Institute of
  Instruction, 1830.

Bathing or ablution, when conducted as recommended on pages 60 and 61, is not only a means
of cleanliness and of exciting a healthy action in the skin, but it constitutes, at the same
time, a most admirable exercise. If a lodging-room has been properly ventilated by leaving
open windows, or otherwise, so that the air is pure and healthful in the morning, ten or fifteen
minutes spent in bathing and friction, with a proper exercise of the muscles of the back and
abdomen, will contribute more to invigorate the system and promote the general health than
twice the amount of exercise taken at any other time or in any other way.

From the foregoing remarks, it appears that the most perfect of all exercises are those which
combine the free play of all the muscles of the body, mental interest and excitement, and the
unrestrained use of the voice.

CHAPTER IV.

THE LAWS OF HEALTH. PHILOSOPHY OF RESPIRATION.

    We instinctively shun approach to the dirty, the squalid, and the
    diseased, and use no garment that may have been worn by another. We
    open sewers for matters that offend the sight or the smell, and
    contaminate the air. We carefully remove impurities from what we eat
    and drink, filter turbid water, and fastidiously avoid drinking from
    a cup that may have been pressed to the lips of a friend. On the
    other hand, we resort to places of assembly, and draw into our
    mouths air loaded with effluvia from the lungs, skin, and clothing
    of every individual in the promiscuous crowd--exhalations offensive,
    to a certain extent, from the most healthy individuals; but when
    arising from a living mass of skin and lungs in all stages of
    evaporation, disease, and putridity, they are in the highest degree
    deleterious and loathsome.--BIRNAN.

Respiration is usually defined as the process by which air is taken into the lungs and expelled
from them. It explains the changes that take place in these organs, in the conversion of chyle
and venous, or worn-out blood, into arterial or nutrient blood. In order to be clearly understood,
I must premise a few observations on the circulation of the blood.[11] The blood circulating
through the body is of two different kinds; the one red or arterial, and the other dark or
venous blood. The former alone is capable of affording nourishment and supporting life. It
is distributed from the left side of the heart all over the body by means of a great artery,
which subdivides in its course, and ultimately terminates in myriads of very minute ramifications
closely interwoven with, and in reality constituting a part of, the texture of every living
part. On reaching this extreme point of its course, the blood passes into equally minute ramifications
of the veins, which in their turn gradually coalesce, and form larger and larger trunks, till
they at last terminate in two large veins, by which the whole current of the venous blood is
brought back in a direction contrary to that of the blood in the arteries, and poured into
the right side of the heart. On examining the quality of the blood in the arteries and veins,
it is found to have undergone a great change in its passage from the one to the other. The
florid hue which distinguished it in the arteries has disappeared, and given place to the dark
color characteristic of venous blood. Its properties, too, have changed, and it is now no longer
capable of sustaining life.

  [11] Taken, with slight alterations, from the description of Dr. A.
  Combe.

Two conditions are essential to the reconversion of venous into arterial blood, and to the
restoration of its vital properties. The first is an adequate provision of new materials from
the food to supply the place of those which have been expended in nutrition, and the second
is the free exposure of the venous blood to the atmospheric air. The first condition is fulfilled
by the chyle, or nutrient portion of the food, being regularly poured into the venous blood
just before it reaches the right side of the heart, and the second by the important process
of respiration, which takes place in the air-cells of the lungs. The venous blood, having arrived
at the right side of the heart, is propelled by the contraction of that organ into a large
artery, leading directly, by separate branches, to the two lungs, and hence called the pulmonary
artery. In the innumerable branches of this artery expanding themselves throughout the substance
of the lungs, the dark blood is subjected to the contact of the air inhaled in breathing, and
a change in the composition both of the blood and of the inhaled air takes place, in consequence
of which the former is found to have reassumed its florid or arterial hue, and to have regained
its power of supporting life. The blood then enters minute venous ramifications, which gradually
coalesce into larger branches, and at last terminate in four large trunks in the left side
of the heart, whence the blood, in its arterial form, is again distributed over the body, to
pursue the same course and undergo the same change as before.

It will be perceived that there are two distinct circulations, each of which is carried on
by its own system of vessels. The one is from the left side of the heart to every part of the
body, and back to the right side of the heart. The other is from the right side of the heart
to the lungs, and back to the left side of the heart. The former has for its object nutrition
and the maintenance of life; and the latter, the restoration of the deteriorated blood, and
the animalization or assimilation of the chyle from which the blood is formed. This process
has already been referred to as the completion of digestion; for chyle is not fitted to nourish
the system until, by its exposure to the atmospheric air in the lungs, it is converted into
arterial blood.

As the food can not become a part of the living animal, or the venous blood regain its lost
properties until they have undergone the requisite changes in the air-cells of the lungs, the
function of respiration by which these are effected is one of pre-eminent importance in the
animal economy, and well deserves the most careful examination. The term respiration is frequently
restricted to the mere inhalation and expiration of air from the lungs, but more generally
it is employed to designate the whole series of phenomena which occur in these organs. The
term sanguification is occasionally used to denote that part of the process in which the blood,
by exposure to the action of the air, passes from the venous to the arterial state. As the
chyle does not become assimilated to the blood until it has passed through the lungs, this
term, which signifies blood-making, is not unaptly used.

The quantity and quality of the blood have a most direct and material influence upon the condition
of every part of the body. If the quantity sent to the arm, for example, be diminished by tying
the artery through which it is conveyed, the arm, being then imperfectly nourished, wastes
away, and does not regain its plumpness till the full supply of blood be restored. In like
manner, when the quality of that fluid is impaired by deficiency of food, bad digestion, impure
air, or imperfect sanguification in the lungs, the body and all its functions become more or
less disordered. Thus, in consumption, death takes place chiefly in consequence of respiration
not being sufficiently perfect to admit of the formation of proper blood in the lungs. A knowledge
of the structure and functions of the lungs, and of the conditions favorable to their healthy
action, is therefore very important, for on their welfare depends that of every organ of the body.

The exposure of the blood to the action of the air seems to be indispensable to every variety
of animated creatures. In man and the more perfect of the lower animals, it is carried on in
the lungs, the structure of which is admirably adapted for the purpose. In many animals, however,
the requisite action is effected without the intervention of lungs. In fishes, for example,
that live in water and do not breathe, the blood circulates through the gills, and in them
is exposed to the air which the water contains. So necessary is the atmospheric air to the
vitality of the blood in all animals, that the want of it inevitably proves fatal. A fish can
no more live in water deprived of air, than a man could in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen,
which is the element that unites with the blood in the lungs in sanguification.

In man the lungs are those large, light, spongy bodies which, along with the heart, completely
fill up the cavity of the chest. They vary much in size in different persons; and as the chest
is formed for their protection, it is either large and capacious, or the reverse, according
to the size of the lungs.

The substance of the lungs consists of bronchial tubes, air-cells, blood-vessels, nerves, and
cellular membrane. The bronchial tubes are merely continuations and subdivisions of the windpipe,
and serve to convey the external air to the air-cells of the lungs. The air-cells constitute
the chief part of the lungs, and are the termination of the smaller branches of the bronchial
tubes. When fully distended, they are so numerous as in appearance to constitute almost the
whole lung. They are of various sizes, from the twentieth to the hundredth of an inch in diameter,
and are lined with an exceedingly fine, thin membrane, on which the minute capillary branches
of the pulmonary arteries and veins are copiously ramified. It is while circulating in the
small vessels of this membrane, and there exposed to the air, that the blood undergoes the
change from the venous to the arterial state. So numerous are these air-cells, that the aggregate
extent of their lining membrane in man has been computed to exceed twenty thousand square inches,
or about ten times the surface of the human body. Some writers place the estimate considerably
higher.

A copious exhalation of moisture takes place in breathing, which presents a striking analogy
to the exhalation from the surface of the skin already described. In the former as in the latter
instance, the exhalation is carried on by the innumerable minute capillary vessels in which
the small arterial branches terminate in the air-cells. Pulmonary exhalation is, in fact, one
of the chief outlets of waste matter from the system; and the air we breathe is thus vitiated,
not only by the subtraction of its oxygen and the addition of carbonic acid gas, but also by
animal effluvia, with which it is loaded when returned from the lungs. In some individuals
this last source of impurity is so great as to render their vicinity offensive, and even insupportable.
It is this which gives the disagreeable, sickening smell to crowded rooms. The air which is
expired from the lungs is rendered offensive by various other causes. When spirituous liquors
are taken into the stomach, for example, they are absorbed by the veins and mixed with the
venous blood, in which they are carried to the lungs to be expelled from the body. In some
instances, when persons have drank copiously of spirits, their breath has been so saturated
with them as actually to take fire and burn. An instance of this kind has recently been communicated
to me by several reliable witnesses, in which the flame was extinguished by closing the mouth
and nose, thus excluding the pure air that supported the combustion, until the unfortunate
experimenter could remove the candle by which his breath had taken fire. This illustration
will explain how the odor of different substances is frequently perceptible in the breath long
after the mouth is free from them.

The lungs not only exhale waste matter, but absorption takes place from their lining membrane.
In both of these respects there is a striking analogy between the functions performed by the
lungs and the skin. When a person breathes an atmosphere loaded with the fumes of spirits,
tobacco, turpentine, or of any other volatile substance, a portion of the fumes is taken up
by the absorbing vessels of the lungs, and carried into the system, and there produces precisely
the same effects as if introduced into the stomach. Dogs, for example, have been killed by
being made to inhale the fumes of prussic acid for a few minutes. The lungs thus become a ready
inlet to contagion, miasmata, and other poisonous influences diffused through the air we breathe.

From this general explanation of the structure and uses of the lungs, it is obvious that several
conditions which it is our interest to know and observe are essential to the healthy performance
of the important function of respiration. The first among these is a healthy original formation
of the lungs. No fact in medicine is better established, says Dr. Combe, than that which proves
the hereditary transmission, from parents to children, of a constitutional liability to pulmonary
disease, and especially to consumption; yet, continues he, no condition is less attended to
in forming matrimonial engagements.

Another requisite to the well-being of the lungs, and to the free and salutary exercise of
respiration, is a due supply of rich and healthy blood. When, from defective food or impaired
digestion, the blood is impoverished in quality, and rendered unfit for adequate nutrition,
the lungs speedily suffer, and that often to a fatal extent. The free and easy expansion of
the chest is also indispensable to the full play and dilation of the lungs. Whatever interferes
with or impedes it, either in dress or in position, is obviously prejudicial to health. On
the other hand, whatever favors the free expansion of the chest equally promotes the healthy
action of the respiratory organs. Stays and corsets, and tight vests and waistbands, operate
most injuriously, compressing as they do the thoracic cavity, and interfering with the healthy
dilation of the lungs.

The admirable harmony established by the Creator between the various constituent parts of the
animal frame, renders it impossible to pay regard to the conditions required for the health
of any one, or to infringe the conditions required therefor, without all the rest participating
in the benefit or injury. Thus, while cheerful exercise in the open air and in the society
of equals is directly and eminently conducive to the well-being of the muscular system, the
advantage does not stop there, the beneficent Creator having kindly so ordered it that the
same exercise shall be scarcely less advantageous to the important function of respiration.
Active exercise calls the lungs into play, favors their expansion, promotes the circulation
of the blood through their substance, and leads to their complete and healthy development.
The same end is greatly facilitated by that free and vigorous exercise of the voice, which
so uniformly accompanies and enlivens the sports of the young, and which doubles the benefits
derived from them considered as exercise. The excitement of the social and moral feelings which
children experience while engaged in play is another powerful tonic, the influence of which
on the general health ought not to be overlooked; for the nervous influence is as indispensable
to the right performance of respiration as it is to the action of the muscles or to the digestion
of food.

The regular supply of pure fresh air is another essential condition of healthy respiration,
without which the requisite changes in the constitution of the blood, as it passes through
the lungs, can not be effected. To enable the reader to appreciate this condition, it is necessary
to consider the nature of the changes alluded to.

It is ascertained by analysis that the air we breathe is composed chiefly of the two gases
nitrogen and oxygen, united in the ratio of four to one by volume, with exceedingly small and
variable quantities of carbonic acid and aqueous vapor. No other mixture of these, or of any
other gases, will sustain healthy respiration. To be more specific--atmospheric air consists
of about seventy-eight per cent. of nitrogen, twenty-one per cent. of oxygen, and not quite
one per cent. of carbonic acid. Such is its constitution when taken into the lungs in the act
of breathing. When it is expelled from them, however, its composition is found to be greatly
altered. The quantity of nitrogen remains nearly the same, but eight or eight and a half per
cent. of the oxygen or vital air have disappeared, and been replaced by an equal amount of
carbonic acid. In addition to these changes, the expired air is loaded with moisture. Simultaneously
with these occurrences, the blood collected from the veins, which enters the lungs of a dark
color and unfit for the support of life, assumes a florid hue and acquires the power of supporting
life.

Physiologists are not fully agreed in explaining the processes by which these changes are effected
in the lungs. All, however, agree that the change of the blood in the lungs is essentially
dependent on the supply of oxygen contained in the air we breathe, and that air is fit or unfit
for respiration in exact proportion as its quantity of oxygen approaches to, or differs from,
that contained in pure air. If we attempt to breathe nitrogen, hydrogen, or any other gas that
does not contain oxygen, the result will be speedy suffocation. If, on the other hand, we breathe
air containing too great a proportion of oxygen, the vital powers will speedily suffer from
excess of stimulus.

The chief chemical properties of the atmosphere are owing to the presence of oxygen. Nitrogen,
which constitutes about four fifths of its volume, has been supposed to act as a mere diluent
to the oxygen. Increase the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere, and, as already stated,
the vital powers will speedily suffer from excess of stimulus, the circulation and respiration
become too rapid, and the system generally becomes highly excited. Diminish the proportion
of oxygen, and the circulation and respiration become too slow, weakness and lassitude ensue,
and a sense of heaviness and uneasiness pervades the entire system. As has been observed, air
loses during each respiration a portion of its oxygen, and gains an equal quantity of carbonic
acid, which is an active poison. When mixed with atmospheric air in the ratio of one to four,
it extinguishes animal life. It is this gas that is produced by burning charcoal in a confined
portion of common air. Its effect upon the system is well known to every reader of our newspapers.
It causes dimness of sight, weakness, dullness, a difficulty of breathing, and ultimately apoplexy
and death.[12]

  [12] Since the text was prepared for the press, I have noticed from the
  Syracuse (New York) Journal of January 3d, 1850, mention of the death of
  General Rensselaer Van Rensselaer, of that city, from breathing "the
  fumes of charcoal" burned in a "portable furnace." This, it should be
  remembered, is but one of the many instances that are constantly
  occurring all over our country, in which immediate death is the result
  of breathing this destructive agent.

Respiration produces the same effect upon air that the burning of charcoal does. It converts
its oxygen, which is the aliment of animal life, into carbonic acid, which, be it remembered,
is an active poison. Says Dr. Turner, in his celebrated work on chemistry, "An animal can not
live in air which is unable to support combustion." Says the same author again, "An animal
can not live in air which contains sufficient carbonic acid for extinguishing a candle." It
will presently be seen why these quotations are made.

It is stated in several medical works that the quantity of air that enters the lungs at each
inspiration of an adult varies from thirty-two to forty cubic inches. To establish more definitely
some data upon which a calculation might safely be based, I some years ago conducted an experiment
whereby I ascertained the medium quantity of air that entered the lungs of myself and four
young men was thirty-six cubic inches, and that respiration is repeated once in three seconds,
or twenty times a minute. I also ascertained that respired air will not support combustion.
This truth, taken in connection with the quotations just made, establishes another and a more
important truth, viz., that AIR ONCE RESPIRED WILL NOT FURTHER SUSTAIN ANIMAL LIFE. That part
of the experiment by which it was ascertained that respired air will not support combustion
is very simple, and I here give it with the hope that it may be tried at least in every school-house,
if not in every family of our wide-spread country. It was conducted as follows:

I introduced a lighted taper into an inverted receiver (glass jar) which contained seven quarts
of atmospheric air, and placed the mouth of the receiver into a vessel of water. The taper
burned with its wonted brilliancy about a minute, and, growing dim gradually, became extinct
at the expiration of three minutes. I then filled the receiver with water, and inverting it,
placed its mouth beneath the surface of the same fluid in another vessel. I next removed the
water from the receiver by breathing into it. This was done by filling the lungs with air,
which, after being retained a short time in the chest, was exhaled through a siphon (a bent
lead tube) into the receiver. I then introduced the lighted taper into the receiver of respired
air, by which it was immediately extinguished. Several persons present then received a quantity
of respired air into their lungs, whereupon the premonitory symptoms of apoplexy, as already
given, ensued. The experiment was conducted with great care, and several times repeated in
the presence of respectable members of the medical profession, a professor of chemistry, and
several literary gentlemen, to their entire satisfaction.

Before proceeding further, I will make a practical application of the principles already established.
Within the last ten years I have visited half of the states of the Union for the purpose of
becoming acquainted with the actual condition of our common schools. I have therefore noticed
especially the condition of school-houses. Although there is a great variety in their dimensions,
yet there are comparatively few school-houses less than sixteen by eighteen feet on the ground,
and fewer still larger than twenty-four by thirty feet, exclusive of our principal cities and
villages. From a large number of actual measurements, not only in New York and Michigan, but
east of the Hudson River and west of the great lakes, I conclude that, exclusive of entry and
closets, when they are furnished with these appendages, school-houses are not usually larger
than twenty by twenty-four feet on the ground, and seven feet in height. They are, indeed,
more frequently smaller than larger. School-houses of these dimensions have a capacity of 3360
cubic feet, and are usually occupied by at least forty-five scholars in the winter season.
Not unfrequently sixty or seventy, and occasionally more than a hundred scholars occupy a room
of this size.

A simple arithmetical computation will abundantly satisfy any person who is acquainted with
the composition of the atmosphere, the influence of respiration upon its fitness to sustain
animal life, and the quantity of air that enters the lungs at each inspiration, that a school-room
of the preceding dimensions contains quite too little air to sustain the healthy respiration
of even forty-five scholars three hours--the usual length of each session; and frequently the
school-house is imperfectly ventilated between the sessions at noon, and sometimes for several
days together.

Mark the following particulars: 1. The quantity of air breathed by forty-five persons in three
hours, according to the data just given, is 3375 cubic feet. 2. Air once respired will not
sustain animal life. 3. The school-room was estimated to possess a capacity of 3360 cubic feet--fifteen
feet less than is necessary to sustain healthy respiration. 4. Were forty-five persons whose
lungs possess the estimated capacity placed in an air-tight room of the preceding dimensions,
and could they breathe pure air till it was all once respired, and then enter upon its second
respiration, they would all die with the apoplexy before the expiration of a three hours' session.

From the nature of the case, these conditions can not conveniently be fulfilled. But numerous
instances of fearful approximation exist. We have no air-tight houses. But in our latitude,
comfort requires that rooms which are to be occupied by children in the winter season, be made
very close. The dimensions of rooms are, moreover, frequently narrowed, that the warm breath
may lessen the amount of fuel necessary to preserve a comfortable temperature. It is true,
on the other hand, that the quantity of air which children breathe is somewhat less than I
have estimated. But the derangement resulting from breathing impure air, in their case, is
greater than in the case of adults whose constitutions are matured, and who are hence less
susceptible of injury. It is also true in many schools that the number occupying a room of
the dimensions supposed is considerably greater than I have estimated. Moreover, in many instances,
a great proportion of the larger scholars will respire the estimated quantity of air.

Again, all the air in a room is not respired once before a portion of it is breathed the second,
or even the third and fourth time. The atmosphere is not suddenly changed from purity to impurity--from
a healthful to an infectious state. Were it so, the change, being more perceptible, would be
seen and felt too, and a remedy would be sought and applied. But because the change is gradual,
it is not the less fearful in its consequences. In a room occupied by forty-five persons, THE
FIRST MINUTE, thirty-two thousand four hundred cubic inches of air impart their entire vitality
to sustain animal life, and, mingling with the atmosphere of the room, proportionately deteriorate
the whole mass. Thus are abundantly sown in early life the fruitful seeds of disease and premature
death.

This detail shows conclusively sufficient cause for that uneasy, listless state of feeling
which is so prevalent in crowded school-rooms. It explains why children that are amiable at
home are mischievous in school, and why those that are troublesome at home are frequently well-nigh
uncontrollable in school. It discloses the true cause why so many teachers who are justly considered
both pleasant and amiable in the ordinary domestic and social relations, are obnoxious in the
school-room, being there habitually sour and fretful. The ever-active children are disqualified
for study, and engage in mischief as their only alternative. On the other hand, the irritable
teacher, who can hardly look with complaisance upon good behavior, is disposed to magnify the
most trifling departure from the rules of propriety. The scholars are continually becoming
more ungovernable, and the teacher more unfit to govern them. Week after week they become less
and less attached to him, and he, in turn, becomes less interested in them.

This detail explains, also, why so many children are unable to attend school at all, or become
unwell so soon after commencing to attend, when their health is sufficient to engage in other
pursuits. The number of scholars answering this description is greater than most persons are
aware of. In one district that I visited a few years ago in the State of New York, it was acknowledged
by competent judges to be emphatically true in the case of not less than twenty-five scholars.
Indeed, in that same district, the health of more than one hundred scholars was materially
injured every year in consequence of occupying an old and partially-decayed house, of too narrow
dimensions, with very limited facilities for ventilation. The evil, even after the cause was
made known, was suffered to exist for years, although the district was worth more than three
hundred thousand dollars. And what was true[13] of this school, is now, with a few variations,
true in the case of scores, if not hundreds of schools with which I am acquainted, from far-famed
New England to the Valley of the Mississippi.

  [13] In the district referred to there has since been erected a large
  and commodious union school house, which constitutes at once the pride
  and ornament of a beautiful and flourishing village.

This detail likewise explains why the business of teaching has acquired, and justly too, the
reputation of being unhealthy. There is, however, no reason why the health of either teacher
or pupils should sooner fail in a well-regulated school, taught in a house properly constructed,
and suitably warmed and ventilated, than in almost any other business. If this statement were
not true, an unanswerable argument might be framed against the very existence of schools; and
it might clearly be shown that it is policy, nay, DUTY, to close at once and forever the four
thousand school-houses of Michigan, and the hundred thousand of the nation, and leave the rising
generation to perish for lack of knowledge. But our condition in this respect is not hopeless.
The evil in question may be effectually remedied by enlarging the house, or, which is easier,
cheaper, and more effectual, by frequent and thorough ventilation. It would be well, however,
to unite the two methods.

In the winter of 1841-2, I visited a school in which the magnitude of the evil under consideration
was clearly developed. Five of the citizens of the district attended me in my visit to the
school. We arrived at the school-house about the middle of the afternoon. It was a close, new
house, eighteen by twenty-four feet on the ground--two feet less in one of its dimensions than
the house concerning which the preceding calculation is made. There were present forty-three
scholars, the teacher, five patrons, and myself, making fifty in all. Immediately after entering
the school-house, one of the trustees remarked to me, "I believe our school-house is too tight
to be healthy." I made no reply, but secretly resolved that I would sacrifice my comfort for
the remainder of the afternoon, and hazard my health, and my life even, to test the accuracy
of the opinions I had entertained on this important subject. I marked the uneasiness and dullness
of all present, and especially of the patrons, who had been accustomed to breathe a purer atmosphere.
School continued an hour and a half, at the close of which I was invited to make some remarks.
I arose to do so, but was unable to proceed till I opened the outer door, and snuffed a few
times the purer air without. When I had partially recovered my wonted vigor, I observed with
delight the renovating influence of the current of air that entered the door, mingling with
and gradually displacing the fluid poison that filled the room, and was about to do the work
of death. It seemed as though I was standing at the mouth of a huge sepulcher, in which the
dead were being restored to life. After a short pause, I proceeded with a few remarks, chiefly,
however, on the subject of respiration and ventilation. The trustees, who had just tested their
accuracy and bearing upon their comfort and health, resolved immediately to provide for ventilation
according to the suggestions in the article on school-houses in the last chapter of this work.

Before leaving the house on that occasion, I was informed an evening meeting had been attended
there the preceding week, which they were obliged to dismiss before the ordinary exercises
were concluded, because, as they said, "We all got sick, and the candles went almost out."
Little did they realize, probably, that the light of life became just as nearly extinct as
did the candles. Had they remained there a little longer, both would have gone out together,
and there would have been reacted the memorable tragedy of the Black Hole in Calcutta, into
which were thrust a garrison of one hundred and forty-six persons, one hundred and twenty-three
of whom perished miserably in a few hours, being suffocated by the confined air.

What has been said in the preceding pages on the philosophy of respiration was first given
to the public nearly ten years ago, in a report of the author's in the State of New York. He
has since seen the same sentiments inculcated by many of our most eminent practical educators,
some of whom had written upon the subject at an earlier date. Allen and Pepy showed by experiment
that air which has been once breathed contains eight and a half per cent. of carbonic acid,
and that no continuance of the respiration of the same air could make it take up more than
ten per cent. Air, then, when once respired, has taken up more than four fifths of the amount
of this noxious gas that it can be made to by any number of breathings.

Dr. Clark, in his work on Consumption, remarks as follows: "Were I to select two circumstances
which influence the health, especially during the growth of the body, more than others, and
concerning which the public, ignorant at present, ought to be well informed, they would be
the proper adaptation of food to difference of age and constitution, and the constant supply
of pure air for respiration." Dr. William A. Alcott, who has given especial attention to this
subject, after quoting the preceding remark of Dr. Clark, adds: "We believe this is the opinion
of all medical men who have studied the constitution of man, and its relation to outward objects."

A distinguished surgeon[14] of Leeds, England, goes somewhat further in praising pure air than
most of his contemporaries. "Be it remembered," says he, "that man subsists more upon air than
upon his food and drink." There is some novelty in this remark, I admit: but is it not truthful?
Men have been known to live three weeks without eating. But exclude the atmospheric air from
the lungs for the space of three minutes, and death generally ensues. We thus see that life
will continue with abstinence from food three thousand times as long as it is safe to protract
an atmospheric fast.

  [14] Dr. Thackrah, author of a most valuable work on the "Effects of
  Employments on the Health and Longevity of Mankind."

Let us take another view of the subject. Men usually eat three times in twenty-four hours.
This is all that is necessary to, or compatible with, the enjoyment of uninterrupted good health.
But we involuntarily breathe nearly thirty thousand times in the same length of time. We need,
then, fresh supplies of pure air ten thousand times as often as it is necessary to partake
of meals. Is it not apparent, then, that man subsists more upon AIR than upon his FOOD and DRINK?

The atmosphere which we so frequently inhale, and upon which our well-being so much depends,
surrounds the earth to the height of about forty-five miles. The surface of the earth contains
about two hundred millions of square miles, and it is estimated that there dwell upon it eight
hundred millions of inhabitants. This gives to each individual about eleven cubic miles of
air. But the air is breathed by the inferior animals as well as by man. It is also rendered
impure by combustion. If by both of these causes ten times as much air is consumed as by man,
there is still left one cubic mile of uncontaminated atmospheric air to every human being dwelling
upon the surface of the earth. This would allow him to live more than twice the age allotted
to man, without breathing any portion of the atmosphere a second time. And still, as if to
avoid the possibility of evil to man on this account, the beneficent Creator has wisely so
ordered, that while we do not interfere with the laws of Nature, there is not even the possibility
of rebreathing respired air until it has been purified and restored to its natural and healthful
state; for carbonic acid, the vitiating product of respiration, although immediately fatal
to animals, constitutes the very life of vegetation. When brought in contact with the upper
surface of the green leaves of trees and plants, and acted upon by the direct solar rays, this
gas is decomposed, and its carbon is absorbed to sustain, in part, the life of the plant, by
affording it one element of its food, while the oxygen is liberated and restored to the atmosphere.
Vegetables and animals are thus perpetually interchanging kindly offices, and each flourishes
upon that which is fatal to the other. It is in this way that the healthful state of the atmosphere
is kept up. Its equilibrium seems never to be disturbed, or, if disturbed at all, it is immediately
restored by the mutual exchange of poison for aliment, which is constantly going on between
the animal and vegetable worlds. This interchange of kindly offices is constantly going on
all over the earth, even in the highest latitudes, and in the very depths of winter; for air
which has been respired is rarefied, and, when thrown from the lungs, ascends, and is thus
not only out of our reach, whereby we are protected from respiring it a second time, but this
(to us) deadly poison falls into the great aërial current which is constantly flowing from
the polar to the tropical regions, where it is converted into vegetable growth. The oxygen
which is exhaled in the processes of tropical vegetation, heated and rarefied by the vertical
rays of the sun, mounts to the upper regions of the atmosphere, and, falling into a returning
current, in its appointed time revisits the higher latitudes. So wisely has the Divine Author
ordered these processes, that air, in its natural state[15] in any part of the world, does
not contain more than one half of one per cent. of carbonic acid gas, although, as already
stated, air which has been once respired contains eight and a half per cent. of this gas, which
is at least seventeen times its natural quantity.

  [15] It would be difficult to say whether carbonic acid gas is in the
  atmosphere constitutionally, or accidentally, or both.--Dr. Wm. A.
  Alcott's Health Tracts.

There are other agencies than carbonic acid gas which in civic life render the atmosphere impure.
Of this nature is carbureted hydrogen gas, which is produced in various ways. This, says Dr.
Comstock, is immediately destructive to animal life, and will not support combustion. It exists
in stagnant water, especially in warm weather, and is generated by the decomposition of vegetable
products. Dr. Arnott expresses the conviction that the immediate and chief cause of many of
the diseases which impair the bodily and mental health of the people, and bring a considerable
portion prematurely to the grave, is the poison of atmospheric impurity, arising from the accumulation
in and around their dwellings of the decomposing remnants of the substances used for food and
in their arts, and of the impurities given out from their own bodies. If you allow the sources
of aërial impurity to exist in or around dwellings, he continues, you are poisoning the people;
and while many die at early ages of fevers and other acute diseases, the remainder will have
their health impaired and their lives shortened.

There are many instances on record where the progress of an epidemic has been speedily arrested
by ventilation. A striking instance is given by the writer last quoted. "When I visited Glasgow
with Mr. Chadwick," says he, "there was described to us one vast lodging-house, in connection
with a manufactory there, in which formerly fever constantly prevailed, but where, by making
an opening from the top of each room through a channel of communication to an air-pump common
to all the channels, the disease had disappeared altogether. The supply of pure air obtained
by that mode of ventilation was sufficient to dilute the cause of the disease, so that it became
powerless."

Sulphureted hydrogen gas is also exceedingly poisonous to the lungs and to every part of the
system. When pure, this gas is described as instantly fatal to animal life. Even when diluted
with fifteen hundred times its bulk of air, it has been found so poisonous as to destroy a
bird in a few seconds. "This gas," says Dr. Dunglison, in his Elements of Hygiene, "is extremely
deleterious.[16] When respired in a pure state it kills instantly; and its deadly agency is
rapidly exerted when put in contact with any of the tissues of the body, through which it penetrates
with astonishing rapidity. Even when mixed with a portion of air, it has proved immediately
destructive. Dr. Paris refers to the case of a chemist of his acquaintance, who was suddenly
deprived of sense as he stood over a pneumatic trough in which he was collecting this gas.
From the experiments of Dupuytren and Thenard, air that contains a thousandth part of sulphureted
hydrogen kills birds immediately. A dog perished in air containing a hundredth part, and a
horse in air containing a fiftieth part of it."

  [16] Sulphureted hydrogen gas is the deleterious agent exhaled from
  privies or vaults, which have been so fatal, at times, to night men, who
  have been employed to remove or cleanse them.--Dr. Dunglison.

The preceding are far from being all the causes of atmospheric impurity. Besides these, there
are numerous exhalations, as well as gases, that are poisonous. Some of these exhalations are
more abundant in the night, and about the time of the morning and evening twilight. "Hence
the importance," says a writer on health, "to those who are feeble, of avoiding the air at
all hours except when the sun is considerably above the horizon."

Although the atmosphere, in its natural state, is not at all times perfectly pure, still it
is comparatively so, and especially in the daytime. All, therefore, who would retain and improve
their health, should inhale the open air as much as possible, even though they can not, like
Franklin's Methusalem,[17] be always in it. This remark is applicable to both sexes, and to
every age and condition of life.

  [17] Dr. Franklin, in his usual humorous manner, but with his accustomed
  gravity, relates, in one of his essays, the following anecdote, for the
  purpose, doubtless, of showing the influence of pure air upon health,
  happiness, and longevity.

  "It is recorded of Methusalem, who, being the longest liver, may be
  supposed to have best preserved his health, that he slept always in the
  open air; for when he had lived five hundred years, an angel said to
  him, Arise, Methusalem, and build thee a house, for thou shalt live yet
  five hundred years longer. But Methusalem answered and said, If I am to
  live but five hundred years longer, it is not worth while to build me a
  house. I will sleep in the air as I have been accustomed to do."

The following, from the pen of an American author[18] who has written much and well on physical
education, is pertinent to the subject under consideration: "We breathe bad air principally
as the production of our own bodies. Here is the source of a large share of human wo; and to
this point must his attention be particularly directed who would save himself from disease,
and promote, in the highest possible degree, his health and longevity. We must avoid breathing
over the carbonic acid gas contained in the tight or unventilated rooms in which we labor or
remain for a long time, whether parlors, school-rooms, counting-rooms, bed-rooms, shops, or
factories. The individual who lives most according to nature--who observes with most care the
laws of life and health--must necessarily throw off much carbonic acid from his lungs, if not
from his skin. It does not follow, however, that because this gas is formed we are obliged
to inhale it. We may change our position, change our clothing, ventilate our rooms of all sorts,
shake up our bed-clothing often and air our bed, and use clean, loose, and porous clothing
by night and by day. We may thus very effectually guard against injuries from a very injurious
agent.

  [18] From Dr. William A. Alcott's Tract on Breathing Bad Air.

"One thing should be remembered in connection with this subject which is truly encouraging.
The more we accustom ourselves to pure air, the more easily will our lungs and nasal organs
detect its presence. He who has redeemed his senses and restored his lungs to integrity, like
him who has redeemed a conscience once deadened, is so alive to every bad impression made upon
any of these, that he can often detect impurity around or within him, and thus learn to avoid
it. It will scarcely be possible for such a person long to breathe bad air, or nauseous or
unwholesome effluvia, without knowing it, and learning to avoid the causes which produce it.
Such a person will not neglect long to remove the impurities which accumulate so readily on
the surface of his body, or suffer himself to use food or drink which induces flatulence, and
thus exposes either his intestines or his lungs, or the lungs of others, to that most extremely
poisonous agent, sulphureted hydrogen gas. Nor will he be likely to permit the accumulation
of filth, liquid or solid, around or in his dwelling. There are those whose senses will detect
a very small quantity of stagnant water, or vinegar, or other liquids, or fruit, or changed
food in the house, or even the presence of those semi-putrid substances, wine and cider. But
some will indeed say that such integrity of the senses would be an annoyance rather than a
blessing. On the same principle, however, would a high degree of conscientiousness in regard
to right and wrong in moral conduct be a curse to us. If it be desirable to have our physical
sense of right and wrong benumbed, it is so to have our moral sense benumbed also. Yet what
person of sense ever complained of too tender a conscience, or too perfect a sense of right
and wrong in morals?"

EXERCISE OF THE LUNGS.--Judicious exercise of the lungs, in the opinion of that eminent physiologist,
Dr. Andrew Combe, is one of the most efficacious means which can be employed for promoting
their development and warding off their diseases. In this respect the organs of respiration
closely resemble the muscles and all other organized parts. They are made to be used, and if
they are left in habitual inactivity, their strength and health are unavoidably impaired; while,
if their exercise be ill-timed or excessive, disease will as certainly follow.

The lungs may be exercised directly by the use of the voice in speaking, reading aloud, or
singing, and indirectly by such kinds of bodily or muscular exertion as require quicker and
deeper breathing. In general, both ought to be conjoined. But where the chief object is to
improve the lungs, those kinds which have a tendency to expand the chest and call the organs
of respiration into play ought to be especially preferred. Rowing a boat, fencing, quoits,
shuttlecock, the proper use of skipping the rope, dumb-bells, and gymnastics are of this description,
and have been recommended for this purpose. All of them employ actively the muscles of the
chest and trunk, and excite the lungs themselves to freer and fuller expansion. Climbing up
a hill is, for the same reason, an exercise of high utility in giving tone and freedom to the
pulmonary functions. Where, either from hereditary predisposition or accidental causes, the
chest is unusually weak, every effort should be made, from infancy upward, to favor the growth
and strength of the lungs, by the habitual use of such of these exercises as can most easily
be practiced. The earlier they are resorted to, and the more steadily they are pursued, the
more certainly will their beneficial results be experienced.

If the direct exercise of the lungs in practicing deep inspiration, speaking, reading aloud,
and singing, is properly managed and persevered in, particularly before the frame has become
consolidated, it will exert a very beneficial influence in expanding the chest, and giving
tone and imparting health to the important organs contained in it. As a preventive measure,
Dr. Clark, in his treatise on Consumption and Scrofula, recommends the full expansion of the
chest in the following manner: "We desire the young person, while standing, to throw his arms
and shoulders back, and, while in this position, to inhale slowly as much air as he can, and
repeat this exercise at short intervals several times in succession. When this can be done
in the open air it is most desirable, a double advantage being thus obtained from the practice.
Some exercise of this kind should be adopted daily by all young persons, more especially by
those whose chests are narrow or deformed, and should be slowly and gradually increased."

In this preventive measure recommended by Dr. Clark, some of our most eminent physiologists
heartily concur. They also express the opinion that, for the same reason, even the crying and
sobbing of children, when not caused by disease, contribute to their future health. Dr. Combe
says, "The loud laugh and noisy exclamations attending the sports of the young have an evident
relation to the same beneficial end, and ought, therefore, to be encouraged." But beneficial
as the direct exercise of the lungs is thus shown to be, in expanding and strengthening the
chest, its influence extends still further, and, as we have already seen, contributes greatly
to promote the important process of digestion. If, therefore, the lungs be rarely called into
active exercise, not only do they suffer, but an important aid to digestion being withdrawn,
the stomach and bowels also become weakened, and indigestion and costiveness ensue.

The exercise of what has not unaptly been called Vocal Gymnastics, and the loud and distinct
speaking enforced in many of our schools, not only fortify the vocal organs against the attacks
of disease, but tend greatly to promote the general health. For this purpose, also, as well
as for its social and moral influences, vocal music should be introduced into all our schools.
That by these and like exercises deep inspirations and full expirations are encouraged, any
one may become convinced who will attend to what passes in his own body while reading aloud
a single paragraph.

There is danger of exercising the lungs too much when disease exists in the chest. At such
times, not only speaking, reading aloud, and singing, but ordinary muscular exertion, ought
to be refrained from, or be regulated by professional advice. When a joint is sore or inflamed,
we know that motion impedes its recovery. When the eye is affected, we, for a similar reason,
shut out the light. So, when the stomach is disordered, we respect its condition, and are more
careful about diet. The lungs demand a treatment founded on the same general principle. When
inflamed, they should be exercised as little as possible. All violent exercise ought, therefore,
to be refrained from during at least the active stages of a cold; but colds may often be entirely
prevented at the time of exposure by a proper exercise of the lungs.

In conversing with an eminent physician recently on this subject, he expressed the conviction
that one of the most effectual methods of warding off a cold, when exposed by wet feet or otherwise,
is to take frequent deep inhalations of air. By this means the carbonic acid, which the returning
circulation deposits in the lungs, is not only more effectually disengaged, but, at the same
time, the greater amount of oxygen that enters the lungs and combines with the blood quickens
the circulation, and thus, imparting increased vitality to the system, enables it more effectually
to resist any attack that may be induced by unusual exposure.

A late medical writer, who has become quite celebrated in this country for the successful treatment
of pulmonary consumption,[19] expresses the opinion that, to the consumptive, air is a most
excellent medicine, and "far more valuable than all other remedies." He thinks it "the grand
agent in expanding the chest." In urging the importance of habitually maintaining an erect
position, he expresses the conviction that "practice will soon make sitting or standing perfectly
erect vastly more agreeable and less fatiguing than a stooping posture." To persons predisposed
to consumption, these hints, he thinks, are of the greatest importance. While walking, he says,
"the chest should be carried proudly erect and straight, the top of it pointing rather backward
than forward." To illustrate the advantages of habitually maintaining this position, he refers
to the North American Indians, who never had consumption, and who are remarkable for their
perfectly erect posture while walking. "Next to this," he adds, "it is of vast importance to
the consumptive to breathe well. He should make a practice of taking long breaths, sucking
in all the air he can, and holding it in the chest as long as possible." He recommends the
repetition of this a hundred times a day, and especially with those who have a slight cold
or symptoms of weak lungs. When practiced in pure cold air, its advantages are most apparent.
To increase the benefits resulting from this practice, he recommends the use of the "inhaling
tube." He thinks that inhaling tubes made of silver or gold are much better than those made
of wood or India-rubber. In this opinion I fully concur, for I think with him that gold and
silver tubes will not so readily "contract any impure or poisonous matter." But there is another
and a stronger reason why I prefer silver, and especially GOLD inhaling tubes, to those made
of wood or India-rubber. They would be more highly prized and MORE FREQUENTLY USED.

  [19] S. S. Fitch, M.D., author of "Consumption Cured."

The same writer entertains the belief that about one third of all the consumptions originate
from weakness of the abdominal belts. He hence, in such cases, recommends the use of the "abdominal
supporter." In order to favor an erect posture and an open chest, he also recommends the use
of "shoulder-braces." He says the proper use of these, with other remedies, will "entirely
prevent the possibility of consumption, from whatever cause." The inhaling-tube, together with
the shoulder-braces and supporter when needed, he says are perfect preventives, and should
not be neglected; for if the shoulders are kept off the chest, and the abdomen is well supported,
and then an inhaling tube is faithfully used, "the lungs can never become diseased. Any person
in this way, who chooses to take the trouble, can have a large chest and healthy lungs."

When persons have contracted disease they may require these artificial helps; but it should
be borne in mind that an all-wise and beneficent Creator has kindly given to each of his creatures
two inhaling tubes, admirably adapted to their wants. He has also furnished them with a set
of abdominal muscles which, when properly used, have generally been found to supersede the
necessity of artificial "supporters." He has, moreover, in the plenitude of his goodness, furnished
each member of the human family with a good pair of shoulder-braces. It should also be borne
in mind that Nature's shoulder-braces improve by use, while the artificial ones not only soon
fail, but their very use generally impairs the healthy action of the natural ones; for these,
like all other muscles, improve by use and become enfeebled by disuse. Parents and teachers,
then, and all who have the care of the young, should encourage the correct use of Nature's
inhaling tubes, shoulder-braces, and abdominal supporters; for in this way they have it in
their power not only to supersede the necessity of resorting to artificial ones later in life,
but of preventing much of human misery, and contributing to the permanent elevation of the race.

CHAPTER V.

THE NATURE OF INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL EDUCATION.

    In the cultivation and expansion of the faculties of the mind, we
    act altogether upon organized matter--and this, too, of the most
    delicate kind--which, while it serves as the mediator between body
    and spirit, partakes so largely of the nature, character, and
    essential attributes of the former, that, without its proper
    physical growth and development, all the manifestations of the
    latter sink into comparative insignificance; so that, without a
    perfect organization of the brain, the mental powers must be
    proportionally paralyzed; without its maintaining a healthy
    condition, they must be rendered proportionally weak and
    inactive.[20]--DR. J. L. PEIRCE.

It has already been stated that there exists such an intimate connection between physical,
intellectual, and moral education, that, in order duly to appreciate the importance of either,
we must not view it separate and alone merely, but in connection with both of the others. We
have no means of becoming acquainted with the laws which govern independent mind; but that
mind separate from body is, from its very nature, all-knowing and intelligent, is an opinion
that has obtained to a considerable extent. Be this as it may, it does not immediately concern
us in the present state. This much we know, that embodied mind acquires knowledge slowly, and
with a degree of perfection depending upon the condition of the brain and the bodily organs
of sense, through the medium of which mind communicates with the external world. We do not
even know whether education modifies the mind itself; and, if at all, how it affects it in
its disembodied state. Neither is it important that we should possess this knowledge. There
is, however, much reason for believing that the mind of man in the future state will be permanently
affected by, and enjoy the full benefit of, the preparatory training it has received in this
life; that then, as now, it will be progressive in its attainments; and that the rapidity with
which it will then acquire knowledge, and the nature of its pursuits, will depend upon the
degree of cultivation, and the habits and character formed in this life.

  [20] From an Essay upon the Physical and Intellectual Education of
  Children, written by request of the Managers of the Pennsylvania Lyceum.

From what we know of the beneficent and all-wise Creator, as manifested in his word and works,
we have abundant reason for believing that our highest and enduring good will be best promoted
by becoming acquainted with, and yielding a cheerful obedience to, the laws of organic mind.
Whatever the effect of education upon independent mind may be, we may rest well assured that
man's everlasting well-being in the future state will be most directly and certainly reached
by a strict conformity to those laws which regulate mind in its present mode of being. It should
be borne in mind, also, that just in proportion as man remains ignorant of those laws, or,
knowing them, disregards them, will he fail to secure his best good in this life not only,
but in that which is to come, to an extent corresponding with the influence which education
may exert upon independent mind. In order, then, most successfully to carry forward the great
work of intellectual and moral culture, and to secure to man the fullest benefits of education
in the present life, and in that higher mode of being which awaits him in the future, we have
only to acquaint him with the laws by which embodied mind is governed, and to induce him to
yield a ready, cheerful, and uniform obedience to those laws. We shall therefore devote the
following pages to an inquiry into the laws which must be observed by embodied mind in order
to render it the fittest possible instrument for discovering, applying, and obeying the laws
under which God has placed the universe, which constitutes the one great object of education,
when considered in its widest and true sense.

All physiologists and philosophers regard the brain as the organ of the mind. Although it is
not befitting here to give a particular description of this complicated organ, still it may
be well further to premise that, by nearly universal consent, it is regarded as the immediate
seat of the intellectual faculties not only, but of the passions and moral feelings of our
nature, as well as of consciousness and every other mental act. It is also well established
that the brain is the principal source of that nervous influence which is essential to vitality,
and to the action of each and all of our bodily organs. As, then, its functions are the highest
and most important in the animal economy, it becomes an object of paramount importance in education
to discover the laws by which they are regulated, that by yielding obedience to them we may
avoid the evils consequent on their violation.

Let no one suppose these evils are few or small; for, in the language of an eloquent writer,
"the system of education which is generally pursued in the United States is unphilosophical
in its elementary principles, ill adapted to the condition of man, practically mocks his necessities,
and is intrinsically absurd. The high excellences of the present system, in other respects,
are fully appreciated. Modern education has indeed achieved wonders. It has substituted things
for names, experiment for hypothesis, first principles for arbitrary rules. It has simplified
processes, stripped knowledge of its abstraction and thrown it into visibility, made practical
results rather than mystery the standard by which to measure the value of attainment, and facts
rather than conjecture its circulating medium."[21]

  [21] Report on Manual Labor, by Theodore D. Weld, 1833.

A sound original constitution may be regarded as the first condition of the healthy action
of the brain; for, being a part of the animal economy, it is subject to the same general laws
that govern the other bodily organs. When a healthy brain is transmitted to children, and their
treatment from infancy is judicious and rational, its health becomes so firmly established
that, in after life, its power of endurance will be greatly increased, and it will be enabled
most effectually to ward off the insidious attacks of disease. On the other hand, where this
organ has either inherited deficiencies and imperfections, or where they have been subsequently
induced by early mismanagement, it becomes peculiarly susceptible, and frequently yields to
the slightest attacks. The most eminent physiologists of the age concur in the opinion that,
of all the causes which predispose to nervous and mental disease, the transmission of hereditary
tendency from parents to children is the most powerful, producing, as it does, in the children,
an unusual liability to those maladies under which their parents have labored.

When both parents are descended from tainted families, their progeny, as a matter of course,
will be more deeply affected than where one of them is from a pure stock. This sufficiently
accounts for the fact that hereditary predisposition is a more common cause of nervous disease
in those circles that intermarry much with each other than where a wider choice is exercised.
Fortunately, such is the constitution of society in this country, that there are fewer evils
of this kind among us than are manifest in many of the European states, where intermarriages
are restricted to persons of the same rank, as has already been illustrated by reference to
the grandees of Spain, who have become a race of dwarfs intellectually as well as physically.
But even in this country there are painful illustrations of the truth of the popular belief
that when cousins intermarry their offspring are liable to be idiotic. The command of God not
to marry within certain degrees of consanguinity is, then, in accordance with the organic laws
of our being, and the wisdom of the prohibition is abundantly confirmed by observation.

What was said of hereditary transmission in the second chapter of this work applies here with
increased force. It is of the highest possible importance that this subject should receive
the especial attention of every parent, and of all who may hereafter sustain the parental relation;
for posterity, to the latest generations, will be affected by the laws of hereditary transmission,
whether those laws are understood and obeyed or not. The importance of this subject, already
inconceivably vast, becomes infinitely momentous in view of the probability that the evils
under consideration are not confined to this life, but must, from the nature of the case, continue
to be felt while mind endures.

Unfortunately, it is not merely as a cause of disease that hereditary predisposition is to
be dreaded. The obstacles which it throws in the way of permanent recovery are even more formidable,
and can never be entirely removed. Safety is to be found only in avoiding the perpetuation
of the mischief. When, therefore, two persons, each naturally of an excitable and delicate
nervous temperament, choose to unite for life, they have themselves to blame for the concentrated
influence of similar tendencies in destroying the health of their offspring, and subjecting
them to all the miseries of nervous disease, melancholy, or madness.

There is another consideration that should be noticed here: it is this. Even where no hereditary
defect exists, the state of the mother during pregnancy has an influence on the mental character
and health of the offspring, of which even few parents have any adequate conception. "It is
often in the maternal womb that we are to look for the true cause not only of imbecility, but
of the different kinds of mania. During the agitated periods of the French Revolution, many
ladies then pregnant, and whose minds were kept constantly on the stretch by the anxiety and
alarm inseparable from the epoch in which they lived, and whose nervous systems were thereby
rendered irritable in the highest degree compatible with sanity, were afterward delivered of
infants whose brains and nervous systems had been affected to such a degree by the state of
their parent, that, in future life, as children they were subject to spasms, convulsions, and
other nervous affections, and in youth to imbecility or madness, almost without any exciting
cause."[22]

  [22] The testimony of M. Esquirol, whose talent, general accuracy, and
  extensive experience give great weight to all his well-considered
  opinions, quoted, also, and confirmed by the Physician Extraordinary to
  the Queen in Scotland, and consulting Physician to the King and Queen of
  the Belgians.

  The same eminent author has recorded the following fact, illustrating
  the extent to which the temporary state of the mother, during gestation,
  may influence the whole future life of the child. A pregnant woman,
  otherwise healthy, was greatly alarmed and terrified by the threats of
  her husband when in a state of intoxication. She was afterward
  delivered, at the proper time, of a very delicate child, which was so
  much affected by its mother's agitation that, up to the age of eighteen,
  it continued subject to panic terrors, and then became completely
  maniacal.

  Many illustrative instances might be quoted from medical writers in this
  and other countries. The author might also refer to cases that have
  fallen under his own observation.

Dr. Caldwell, too, an able and philanthropic advocate of an improved system of physical, intellectual,
and moral education in this country, is very urgent in enforcing rational care, during the
period of gestation, on the part of every mother who values the future health and happiness
of her offspring. Among other things, he insists on mothers taking more active exercise in
the open air than they usually do. He also cautions them against allowing a feeling of false
delicacy to keep them confined in their rooms for weeks and months together. At such times
especially the mind ought to be kept free from gloom or anxiety, and in that state of cheerful
activity which results from the proper exercise of the intellect, and especially of the moral
and social feelings.

But if seclusion and depression be hurtful to the unborn progeny, surely thoughtless dissipation
and late hours, dancing and waltzing, together with irritability of temper and peevishness
of disposition, can not be less injurious. Every female that is about to become a mother should
treasure up the remark of that sensible lady, the Margravine of Anspach, who says, "when a
female is likely to become a mother, she ought to be doubly careful of her temper, and, in
particular, to indulge no ideas that are not cheerful and no sentiments that are not kind.
Such is the connection between the mind and the body, that the features of the face are moulded
commonly into an expression of the internal disposition; and is it not natural to think that
an infant, before it is born, may be affected by the temper of its mother?" If these things
are true--and they are as well authenticated as any physiological facts are or can be--then
not only mothers, but all with whom they associate, and especially fathers, are interested
in knowing these important physiological laws; and they should aim, from the very beginning,
so to observe them as to secure to posterity, physically and mentally, the full benefits that
are connected with cheerful obedience.

A due supply of properly oxygenated blood is another condition upon which the healthy action
of the brain depends. Although it may not be easy to perceive the effects of slight differences
in the quality of the blood, still, when these differences exist in a considerable degree,
the effects are too obvious to be overlooked. Withdraw entirely the stimulus of arterial blood,
and the brain ceases to act, and sensibility and consciousness become extinct. When carbonic
acid gas is inhaled, the blood circulating through the lungs does not undergo that process
of oxygenation which is essential to life, as has been explained in a preceding chapter. As
the venous blood in this unchanged state is unfit to excite or sustain the action of the brain,
the mental functions become impaired, and death speedily ensues, as in the case of a number
of persons breathing a portion of confined air, or inhaling the fumes of charcoal. On the other
hand, if oxygen gas be inhaled instead of common air, the blood becomes too much oxygenated,
and, as a consequence, the brain is unduly stimulated, and an intensity of action bordering
on inflammation takes place, which also soon terminates in death.

These are extreme cases, I admit; but their consequences are equally remarkable and fatal.
The slighter variations in the state of the blood produce equally sure, though less palpable
effects. Whenever its vitality is impaired by breathing an atmosphere so vitiated as not to
produce the proper degree of oxygenation, the blood can only afford an imperfect stimulus to
the brain. As a necessary consequence, languor and inactivity of the mental and nervous functions
ensue, and a tendency to headache, fainting, or hysteria makes its appearance. This is seen
every day in the listlessness and apathy prevalent in crowded and ill-ventilated school-rooms,
and in the headaches and liability to fainting which are so sure to attack persons of a delicate
habit, in the contaminated atmospheres of crowded theaters, churches, and assemblies of whatever
kind. The same effects, although less strikingly apparent, are perhaps more permanently felt
by the inmates of cotton manufactories and public hospitals, who are noted for being irritable
and sensitive. The languor and nervous debility consequent on confinement in ill-ventilated
apartments, or in air vitiated by the breath of many people, are neither more nor less than
minor degrees of the process of poisoning, which was particularly explained in the preceding
chapter, while treating upon the philosophy of respiration.

That it is not real debility which produces these effects, is apparent from the fact, that
egress to the open air almost instantly restores activity and vigor to both mind and body,
unless the exposure has been very long. There is an interesting but fearful illustration of
the truth of this statement at the 96th page of this work, to which I beg leave to refer. Where
the exposure has been very long continued, more time is of course required to re-establish
the exhausted powers of the brain. Indeed, we may not, in such cases, hope for complete recovery;
for when persons remain several hours a day in a vitiated atmosphere, for weeks and months
together, both mind and body become permanently diseased. It is well known to every person
who has given attention to the subject, that hitherto this has been the condition of public
schools, generally, in every part of the United States, and throughout the civilized world.
This has, perhaps, tended more than all other causes combined, to render the profession of
teaching disreputable, and to constitute the very name of schoolmaster, or pedagogue, a hissing
and a by-word. And why is this? I can account for it in but one way. The school teacher is
subject to the same organic laws as other men; and, either on account of the ignorance or parsimony
of his employers, he has been shut up with their children several hours a day, in narrow and
ill-ventilated apartments, where, whatever else they may have done, their principal business
has of necessity been to poison one another to death. And, as if not satisfied with this, when
the teacher has ruined his health in our employment, and become a mere wreck, physically and
mentally, we despise him. This is a double injustice, and is adding insult to injury. And the
consequences are hardly less fatal to the children. The situation of the majority of our schools,
when viewed in connection with the physiological laws already explained, sufficiently accounts
for that irritability, listlessness, and languor which have been so often observed in both
teachers and pupils. Both irritability of the nervous system and dullness of the intellect
are unquestionably the direct and necessary result of a want of pure air. The vital energies
of the pupils are thus prostrated, and they become not only restless and indisposed to study,
but absolutely incapable of studying. Their minds hence wander, and they unavoidably seek relief
in mischievous and disorderly conduct. This doubly provokes the already exasperated teacher,
who can hardly look with complaisance upon good behavior, and who, from a like cause, is in
the same irritable condition of both body and mind with themselves. He, too, must needs give
vent to his irascible feelings some how. And what way is more natural, under such circumstances,
than to resort to the use of the ferule, the rod, and the strap! We have already referred to
a case, in which formerly fever constantly prevailed, but where disease disappeared altogether
upon the introduction of pure air. Let the same prudential course be adopted in our schools,
in connection with other appropriate means, and we shall readily see the superiority of the
natural stimulus of oxygen over the artificial sedative of the rod.

The regular and systematic exercise of the functions of the brain is another condition upon
which its healthy action depends. The brain is an organized part, and is subject to precisely
the same laws of exercise that the other bodily organs are. If it is doomed to inactivity,
its health decays, and the mental operations and feelings, as a necessary consequence, become
dull, feeble, and slow. But let it be duly exercised after regular intervals of repose, and
the mind acquires activity and strength. Too severe or too protracted exercise of the brain
is as great a violation of the organic law just stated as inactivity is, and is sometimes productive
of the most fearful consequences. By over-tasking this organ, either in the force or duration
of its activity, its functions become impaired, and irritability and disease take the place
of health and vigor.

So important is the law under consideration, and so essential to the health of the brain and
to the welfare of man, that I deem it advisable to explain more particularly the consequences
of both inadequate and excessive exercise.

We have seen that by disuse the muscles become emaciated and the bones soften. Nor will this
surprise any reflecting person, who considers that the brain, as a part of the same animal
system, is nourished by the same blood, and regulated by the same vital laws as the muscles,
bones, arteries, and nerves. This explains why persons who are cut off from social converse
by some bodily infirmity so frequently become discontented and morose, in spite of every resolution
to the contrary. The feelings and faculties of the mind, which had formerly full play in their
intercourse with their fellow-creatures, have no longer scope for sufficient exercise, and
the almost inevitable result is irritability and weakness in the corresponding parts of the brain.

This fact is strikingly illustrated by reference to the deaf and blind, who, by the loss of
one or more of the senses, are precluded from a full participation in all the varied sources
of interest which their more favored brethren enjoy without abatement, and in whom irritability,
weakness of mind, and idiocy are known to be much more prevalent than among other classes of
people. "The deaf and dumb," says Andral, "presents, in intelligence, character, and the development
of his passions, certain modifications, which depend on his state of isolation in the midst
of society. He remains habitually in a state of half childishness, is very credulous, but,
like the savage, remains free from many of the prejudices acquired in society. In him the tender
feelings are not deep; he appears susceptible neither of strong attachment nor of lively gratitude;
pity moves him feebly; he has little emulation, few enjoyments, and few desires. This is what
is commonly observed in the deaf and dumb; but the picture is far from being of universal application;
some, more happily endowed, are remarkable for the great development of their intellectual
and moral nature; but others, on the contrary, remain immersed in complete idiocy."

Andral adds, that we must not infer from this that the deaf and dumb are therefore constitutionally
inferior in mind to other men. "Their powers are not developed, because they live isolated
from society. Place them, by some means or other, in relation with their fellow-men, and they
will become their equals." This is the cause of the rapid brightening up of both mind and features,
which is so often observed in blind or deaf children when transferred from home to public institutions,
and there taught the means of converse with their fellows.

I have myself witnessed several striking illustrations of the benefits resulting from mental
culture in persons who have lost one or more of their senses. Among these I would especially
instance the American Asylum at Hartford for the education and instruction of the deaf and
dumb, and the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, located at South
Boston, to the accomplished principals and teachers of both of which institutions I would acknowledge
my indebtedness for valuable reports and the information of various kinds which they obligingly
communicated to me at the time of my visits during the past summer.

Dr. Howe, the accomplished director of the Asylum for the Blind, after many years of experience
and careful observation in this country and in Europe, expresses the conviction that the blind,
as a class, are inferior to other persons in mental power and ability. The opinions put forth
in almost every report of the institutions for the blind in this country, in almost all books
on the subject, and even the doctor's earlier writings, may be brought to disprove this statement.
He is now, nevertheless, fully convinced that it will be found true. This erroneous conviction,
every where so prevalent, may be accounted for from the fact that none but intelligent parents
of blind children could at first comprehend the possibility of their being educated, and even
they would not think of trying the experiment except upon a child of more than ordinary ability.
As soon, however, as the experiment proved successful, and institutions for the blind became
generally known, the blind, without distinction--the bright and the backward, the bold and
the timid--resorted to them, which gave an opportunity of judging of the whole class. The result
is, that now, while the schools for the blind present a certain number of children who make
more rapid progress in intellectual studies than the average of seeing children, they also
present a much larger number who are decidedly inferior to them in both physical and mental vigor.

The loss of one sense makes us exercise the others so constantly and so effectually as to acquire
a power quite unknown to common persons. This goes far to compensate the blind man who is in
the pursuit of knowledge, and enables him to learn vastly more of some subjects than other
men; but there are capacities of his nature which can never be developed. Perfect harmony in
the exercise and development of his mental faculties he can never possess, any more than he
can exhibit perfect physical beauty and proportion.

The proposition that the blind, as a class, are inferior in mental power and ability to ordinary
persons, has been established beyond a doubt. Take an equal number of blind and seeing persons,
of as nearly the same age and situation in life as may be, and it has been established by well
authenticated data, that when all the blind have died, there will still be about half of the
seeing ones alive. In other words, the chance of life among the blind is only about half what
it is among the seeing. The standard of bodily health and vigor, then, being so much lower
among the blind, the inevitable inference is that mental power and ability will be proportionably
less also; for such is the dependence of the mind upon the body, that there can be no continuance
of mental health and vigor without bodily health and vigor.

It is also true that the deaf and dumb, as a class, are inferior to other persons in mental
power and ability. The general reasons for this are the same as those already given in the
case of blind persons, and need not hence be repeated. The truth of this proposition is established
beyond a doubt by the concurrent testimony of those who have had the greatest experience with
this unfortunate class of persons both in this country and in Europe. The report of the directors
of the American Asylum for the year 1845 shows that two pupils had died during the year. One
of these had an affection of the lungs which terminated in consumption, and the disease of
the other was dropsy on the brain. In a third, hereditary consumption was rapidly developing
itself. Others, still, had been subject to more or less of bodily indisposition.

After speaking of the case of a young man in whom hereditary consumption had been rapidly developed,
the following statement is introduced: "This great destroyer of our race is found extensively
in Europe, as well as in our own country, to be a common disease among the deaf and dumb. It
is brought on by scrofula, by fevers, by violent colds, and by various other causes; and there
is often, no doubt, a hereditary tendency to it in families connected by blood". If this is
the effect of the loss of one of the senses upon the bodily health, keeping in view the principle
already stated, we shall naturally enough be led to inquire what the influence is upon the
health of the mind. A careful examination of the educational statistics of several states has
convinced me that an unusually large proportion of the deaf and dumb--and perhaps an equally
large proportion of the blind, and especially those who have remained uneducated and unenlightened--have
been visited with mental derangement, and have lived and died insane.

This is easily accounted for. Uneducated persons, who are deprived of one or more of the senses,
are isolated from the world in which they live. The book of nature is open before them, but
they are unable to peruse it. The simplest operations constantly going on around them are locked
in mystery. They are an enigma to themselves. Even those who are endowed with inquisitive minds
are perplexed with the existing state of things. They know nothing of the physical organization
of the planet we inhabit, of its political and civil divisions, and of the whole machinery
of human society, and are profoundly ignorant of the past history and future destiny of the
race to which they belong. It is not remarkable that mind so unnaturally and peculiarly circumstanced--with
its usual inlets of knowledge so obstructed, and deprived of external objects to act upon--should
prey upon itself, and thus superinduce insanity in its usual forms, and more especially when
unaided and undirected by education. Unusual subjects of thought become to him disagreeable
and painful.

But let the situation of such persons be changed; bring them, for instance, from the listlessness
of retirement to the business and bustle of a city; give them a variety of imperative employments,
and place them in society so as to supply to their cerebral organs that extent of exercise
which gives health and vivacity of action, and in a few months the change produced will be
surprising. Health, animation, and acuteness will take the place of former insipidity and dullness.
In such instances, it would be absurd to suppose that it is the mind itself which becomes heavy
and feeble, and again revives into energy by these changes in external circumstances. The effects
arise entirely from changes in the state of the brain, and the mental manifestations and the
bodily health have been improved solely by the improvement of its condition.

The evils arising from excessive or ill-timed exercise of the brain, or any of its parts, are
numerous, and equally in accordance with the ordinary laws of physiology. When we use the eye
too long or in too bright a light, it becomes bloodshot, and the increased action of its vessels
and nerves gives rise to a sensation of fatigue and pain requiring us to desist. If we turn
away and relieve the eye, the irritation gradually subsides, and the healthy state returns;
but if we continue to look intently, or resume our employment before the eye has regained its
natural state by repose, the irritation at last becomes permanent, and disease, followed by
weakness of sight, or even blindness, may ensue, as often happens to glass-blowers, smiths,
and others who are obliged to work in an intense light.

Precisely analogous phenomena occur when, from intense mental excitement, the brain is kept
long in a state of excessive activity. The only difference is, that we can always see what
happens in the eye, but rarely what takes place in the brain. Occasionally, however, cases
of fracture of the skull occur, in which, part of the bone being removed, we can see the quickened
circulation in the vessels of the brain as easily as in those of the eye. Sir Astley Cooper
had a young gentleman brought to him who had lost a portion of his skull just above the eyebrow.
"On examining the head," says Sir Astley, "I distinctly saw that the pulsation of the brain
was regular and slow; but at this time he was agitated by some opposition to his wishes, and
directly the blood was sent with increased force to the brain, and the pulsation became frequent
and violent." Sir Astley hence concludes that, in the treatment of injuries of the brain, if
you omit to keep the mind free from agitation, your other means will be unavailing.

A still more remarkable case is said to have occurred in the hospital of Montpellier in 1821.
The subject of it was a female who had lost a large portion of her scalp, skull-bone, and dura
mater. A corresponding portion of her brain was consequently bare, and subject to inspection.
When she was in a dreamless sleep, her brain was motionless, and lay within the cranium; but
when her sleep was imperfect, and she was agitated by dreams, her brain moved and protruded
without the cranium. In vivid dreams the protrusion was considerable; and when she was awake
and engaged in active thought or sprightly conversation, it was still greater.

In alluding to this subject, Dr. Caldwell remarks, that if it were possible, without doing
an injury to other parts, to augment the constant afflux of healthy arterial blood to the brain,
the mental operations would be invigorated by it. This position is illustrated by reference
to the fact that when a public speaker is flushed and heated in debate, his mind works more
freely and powerfully than at any other time. And why? Because his brain is in better tune.
What has thus suddenly improved its condition? An increased current of blood into it, produced
by the excitement of its own increased action. That the blood does, on such occasions, flow
more copiously into the brain, no one can doubt who is at all acquainted with the cerebral
sensations which the orator himself experiences at the time, or who witnesses the unusual fullness
and flush of his countenance, and the dewiness, flashing, and protrusion of his eye.

Indeed, in many instances, the increased circulation in the brain attendant on high mental
excitement reveals itself by its effects when least expected, and leaves traces after death
which are but too legible. Many are the instances in which public men have been suddenly arrested
in their career by the inordinate action of the brain induced by incessant toil, and more numerous
still are those whose mental power has been forever impaired by similar excess.

It is generally known that the eye, when tasked beyond its strength, becomes insensible to
light, and ceases to convey impressions to the mind. The brain, in like manner, when much exhausted,
becomes incapable of thought, and consciousness is well-nigh lost in a feeling of utter confusion.
At any time in life, excessive and continued mental exertion is hurtful; but in infancy and
early youth, when the structure of the brain is still immature and delicate, permanent injury
is more easily produced by injudicious treatment than at any subsequent period. In this respect,
the analogy is complete between the brain and the other parts of the body, as we have already
seen exemplified in the injurious effects of premature exercise of the bones and muscles. Scrofulous
and rickety children are the most usual sufferers in this way. They are generally remarkable
for large heads, great precocity of understanding, and small, delicate bodies. But in such
instances, the great size of the brain, and the acuteness of the mind, are the results of morbid
growth, and even with the best management, the child passes the first years of its life constantly
on the brink of active disease. Instead, however, of trying to repress its mental activity,
as they should, the fond parents, misled by the promise of genius, too often excite it still
further by unceasing cultivation and the never-failing stimulus of praise; and finding its
progress, for a time, equal to their warmest wishes, they look forward with ecstasy to the
day when its talents will break forth and shed a luster on their name. But in exact proportion
as the picture becomes brighter to their fancy, the probability of its becoming realized becomes
less; for the brain, worn out by premature exertion, either becomes diseased or loses its tone,
leaving the mental powers feeble and depressed for the remainder of life. The expected prodigy
is thus, in the end, easily outstripped in the social race by many whose dull outset promised
him an easy victory.

To him who takes for his guide the necessities of the constitution, it will be obvious that
the modes of treatment commonly resorted to should in such cases be reversed; and that, instead
of straining to the utmost the already irritable powers of the precocious child, leaving his
dull competitors to ripen at leisure, a systematic attempt ought to be made, from early infancy,
to rouse to action the languid faculties of the latter, while no pains should be spared to
moderate and give tone to the activity of the former. But instead of this, the prematurely
intelligent child is generally sent to school, and tasked with lessons at an unusually early
age, while the healthy but more backward boy, who requires to be stimulated, is kept at home
in idleness merely on account of his backwardness. A double error is here committed, and the
consequences to the active-minded boy are not unfrequently the permanent loss both of health
and of his envied superiority of intellect.

In speaking of children of this description, Dr. Brigham, in an excellent little work on the
influence of mental excitement on health, remarks as follows: "Dangerous forms of scrofulous
disease among children have repeatedly fallen under my observation, for which I could not account
in any other way than by supposing that the brain had been excited at the expense of the other
parts of the system, and at a time in life when nature is endeavoring to perfect all the organs
of the body; and after the disease commenced, I have seen, with grief, the influence of the
same cause in retarding or preventing recovery. I have seen several affecting and melancholy
instances of children, five or six years of age, lingering a while with diseases from which
those less gifted readily recover, and at last dying, notwithstanding the utmost efforts to
restore them. During their sickness they constantly manifested a passion for books and mental
excitement, and were admired for the maturity of their minds. The chance for the recovery of
such precocious children is, in my opinion, small when attacked by disease; and several medical
men have informed me that their own observations had led them to form the same opinion, and
have remarked that, in two cases of sickness, if one of the patients was a child of superior
and highly-cultivated mental powers, and the other one equally sick, but whose mind had not
been excited by study, they should feel less confident of the recovery of the former than of
the latter. This mental precocity results from an unnatural development of one organ of the
body at the expense of the constitution."

There can be little doubt but that ignorance on the part of parents and teachers is the principal
cause that leads to the too early and excessive cultivation of the minds of children, and especially
of such as are precocious and delicate. Hence the necessity of imparting instruction on this
subject to both parents and teachers, and to all persons who are in any way charged with the
care and education of the young. This necessity becomes the more imperative from the fact that
the cupidity of authors and publishers has led to the preparation of "children's books," many
of which are announced as purposely prepared "for children from two to three years old!" I
might instance advertisements of "Infant Manuals" of Botany, Geometry, and Astronomy!

In not a few isolated families, but in many neighborhoods, villages, and cities, in various
parts of the country, children under three years of age are not only required to commit to
memory many verses, texts of Scripture, and stories, but are frequently sent to school for
six hours a day. Few children are kept back later than the age of four, unless they reside
a great distance from school, and some not even then. At home, too, they are induced by all
sorts of excitement to learn additional tasks, or peruse juvenile books and magazines, till
the nervous system becomes enfeebled and the health broken. "I have myself," says Dr. Brigham,
"seen many children who are supposed to possess almost miraculous mental powers, experiencing
these effects and sinking under them. Some of them died early, when but six or eight years
of age, but manifested to the last a maturity of understanding, which only increased the agony
of separation. Their minds, like some of the fairest flowers, were 'no sooner blown than blasted;'
others have grown up to manhood, but with feeble bodies and disordered nervous system, which
subjected them to hypochondriasis, dyspepsy, and all the Protean forms of nervous disease;
others of the class of early prodigies exhibit in manhood but small mental powers, and are
the mere passive instruments of those who in early life were accounted far their inferiors."

This hot-bed system of education is not confined to the United States, but is practiced less
or more in all civilized countries. Dr. Combe, of Scotland, gives an account of one of these
early prodigies whose fate he witnessed. The circumstances were exactly such as those above
described. The prematurely developed intellect was admired, and constantly stimulated by injudicious
praise, and by daily exhibition to every visitor who chanced to call. Entertaining books were
thrown in its way, reading by the fireside encouraged, play and exercise neglected, the diet
allowed to be full and heating, and the appetite pampered by every delicacy. The results were
the speedy deterioration of a weak constitution, a high degree of nervous sensibility, deranged
digestion, disordered bowels, defective nutrition, and, lastly, death, at the very time when
the interest excited by the mental precocity was at its height.

Such, however, is the ignorance of the majority of parents and teachers on all physiological
subjects, that when one of these infant prodigies dies from erroneous treatment, it is not
unusual to publish a memoir of his life, that other parents and teachers may see by what means
such transcendent qualities were called forth. Dr. Brigham refers to a memoir of this kind,
in which the history of a child, aged four years and eleven months, is narrated as approved
by "several judicious persons, ministers and others, all of whom united in the request that
it might be published, and all agreed in the opinion that a knowledge of the manner in which
the child was treated, together with the results, would be profitable to both parents and children,
and a benefit to the cause of education." This infant philosopher was "taught hymns before
he could speak plainly;" "reasoned with" and constantly instructed until his last illness,
which, "without any assignable cause," put on a violent and unexpected form, and carried him off!

As a warning to others not to force education too soon or too fast, this case may be truly
profitable to both parents and children, and a benefit to the cause of education; but as an
example to be followed, it assuredly can not be too strongly or too loudly condemned. While
I speak thus strongly, I am ready to admit that infant schools in which physical health and
moral training are duly attended to are excellent institutions, and are particularly advantageous
where parents, from want of leisure or from other causes, are unable to bestow upon their children
that attention which their tender years require.

In youth, too, much mischief is done by the long daily periods of attendance at school, and
the continued application of mind which the ordinary system of education requires. The law
of exercise already more than once repeated, that long-sustained action exhausts the vital
powers of an organ, applies as well to the brain as to the muscles. Hence the necessity of
varying the occupations of the young, and allowing frequent intervals of active exercise in
the open air, instead of enforcing the continued confinement now so common. This exclusive
attention to mental culture fails, as might be expected, even in its essential object; for
all experience shows that, with a rational distribution of employment and exercise, a child
will make greater progress in a given period than in double the time employed in continuous
mental exertion. If the human being were made up of nothing but a brain and nervous system,
we might do well to content ourselves with sedentary pursuits, and to confine our attention
entirely to the mind. But when we learn from observation that we have numerous other important
organs of motion, sanguification, digestion, circulation, and nutrition, all demanding exercise
in the open air, as alike essential to their own health and to that of the nervous system,
it is worse than folly to shut our eyes to the truth, and to act as if we could, by denying
it, alter the constitution of nature, and thereby escape the consequences of our own misconduct.

Reason and experience being thus set at naught by both parents and teachers in the education
of their children, young people naturally grow up with the notion that no such influences as
the laws of organization exist, and that they may follow any course of life which inclination
leads them to prefer without injury to health, provided they avoid what is called dissipation.
It is owing to this ignorance that young men of a studious or literary habit enter heedlessly
upon an amount of mental exertion, unalleviated by bodily exercise or intervals of repose,
which is quite incompatible with the continued enjoyment of a sound mind in a sound body. Such,
however, is the effect of the total neglect of all instruction in the laws of the organic frame
during early education, that it becomes almost impossible effectually to warn an ardent student
against the dangers to which he is constantly exposing himself. Nothing but actual experience
will convince him of the truth.

Numerous are the instances in which young men of the first promise have almost totally disqualified
themselves for future useful exertion in consequence of long-protracted and severe study, who,
under a more rational system of education, might have attained that eminence, the injudicious
pursuit of which has defeated their own most cherished hopes, and ruined their general health.
Such persons might be saved to themselves and to society by early instruction in the nature
and laws of the animal economy. They mean well, but err from ignorance more than from headstrong
zeal.

I shall conclude this chapter with a few rules relating to mental exercise, and the development
and culture of the mind and brain. It is a law of the animal economy that two classes of functions
can not be called into vigorous action at the same time without one or the other, or both,
sooner or later sustaining injury. Hence the important rule never to enter upon continued mental
exertion or to rouse deep feeling immediately after a full meal, otherwise the activity of
the brain is sure to interfere with that of the stomach, and disorder its functions. Even in
a perfectly healthy person, unwelcome news, sudden anxiety, or mental excitement, occurring
after eating, will put an entire stop to digestion, and cause the stomach to loathe the sight
of food. In accordance with this rule, we learn by experience that the very worst forms of
indigestion and nervous depression are those which arise from excessive mental application,
or turmoil of feeling and distraction of mind, conjoined with unrestrained indulgence in the
pleasures of the table. In such circumstances, the stomach and brain react upon and disturb
each other, till all the horrors of nervous disease make their unwelcome appearance, and render
life miserable. The tendency to inactivity and sleep, which besets most animals after a full
meal, shows repose to be, in such circumstances, the evident intention of Nature. The bad effects
of violating this rule, although not in all cases immediately apparent, will most assuredly
be manifest at a period less or more remote.

Dr. Caldwell, who has devoted much time and talent to the diffusion of sound physiological
information and the general improvement of the race, and whose opportunities of observation
have been very extensive, expressly states, that dyspepsy and madness prevail more extensively
in the United States than among the people of any other nation. Of the amount of our dyspeptics,
he says, no estimate can be formed; but it is immense. Whether we inquire in cities, towns,
villages, or country places; among the rich, the poor, or those in moderate circumstances,
we find dyspepsy more or less prevalent throughout the land.

The early part of the day is the best time for severe mental exertion. Nature has allotted
the darkness of night for repose, and for the restoration by sleep of the exhausted energies
of both body and mind. If study or composition be ardently engaged in toward the close of the
day, and especially at a late hour of the evening, sound and invigorating sleep may not be
expected until the night is far spent, for the increased action of the brain which always accompanies
activity of mind requires a long time to subside. Persons who practice night study, if they
be at all of an irritable habit of body, will be sleepless for hours after going to bed, and
be tormented perhaps by unpleasant dreams, which will render their sleep unrefreshing. If this
practice be long continued, the want of refreshing repose will ultimately induce a state of
morbid irritability of the nervous system bordering on insanity. It is therefore of great advantage
to engage in severer studies early in the day, and to devote the after part of the day and
the evening to less intense application. It will be well to devote a portion of the evening,
and especially the latter part of it, to light reading, music, or cheerful and amusing conversation.
The excitement induced in the brain by previous study will be soothed by these influences,
and will more readily subside, and sound and refreshing sleep will be much more likely to follow.
This rule is of the utmost importance to those who are obliged to perform a great amount of
mental labor. It is only by conforming to it, and devoting their mornings to study and their
evenings to relaxation, that many of our most prolific writers have been enabled to preserve
their health. By neglecting this rule, others of the fairest promise have been cut down in
the midst of their usefulness.

Regularity is of great importance in the development and culture of the moral and intellectual
powers, the tendency to resume the same mode of action at stated times being peculiarly the
characteristic of the nervous system. It is this principle of our nature which promotes the
formation of what are called habits. By repeating any kind of mental effort every day at the
same hour, we at length find ourselves entering upon it, without premeditation, when the time
approaches. In like manner, by arranging our studies in accordance with this law, and taking
up each regularly in the same order, a natural aptitude is soon produced, which renders application
more easy than it would be were we to take up the subjects as accident might dictate. The tendency
to periodical and associated activity sometimes becomes so strong, that the faculties seem
to go through their operations almost without conscious effort, while their facility of action
becomes so much increased as ultimately to give unerring certainty where at first great difficulty
was experienced. It is not so much the soul or abstract principle of mind which is thus changed,
as the organic medium through which mind is destined to act in the present mode of being.

The necessity of judicious repetition in mental and moral education is, in fact, too little
adverted to, because the principle on which it is effectual has not hitherto been generally
understood. Practice is as necessary to induce facility of action in the organs of the mind
as in those of motion. The idea or feeling must not only be communicated, but it must be represented
and reproduced in different forms till all the faculties concerned in understanding it come
to work efficiently together in the conception of it, and until a sufficient impression is
made upon the organ of mind to enable the latter to retain it. Servants and others are frequently
blamed for not doing a thing at regular intervals when they have been but once told to do so.
We learn, however, from the organic laws, that it is presumptuous to expect the formation of
a habit from a single act, and that we must reproduce the associated activity of the requisite
faculties many times before the result will certainly follow, just as we must repeat the movement
in dancing or skating many times before we become master of it.

We may understand a new subject by a single perusal, but we can fully master it only by dwelling
upon it again and again. In order to make a durable impression on the mind, repetition is necessary.
It follows, hence, that in learning a language or science, six successive months of application
will be more effectual in fixing it indelibly in the mind, and making it a part of the mental
furniture, than double or even treble the time if the lessons are interrupted by long intervals.
The too common practice of beginning a study, and, after pursuing it a little time, leaving
it to be completed at a later period, is unphilosophical and very injurious. The fatigue of
study is thus doubled, and the success greatly diminished. Studies should not, as a general
thing, be entered upon until the mind is sufficiently mature to understand them thoroughly,
and, when begun, they should not be discontinued until they are completely mastered. By this
means the mind becomes accustomed to sound and healthy action, which alone can qualify the
student for eminent usefulness in after life. Much of the want of success in the various departments
of industry, and many of the failures that are constantly occurring among business men, are
justly attributable to the fits of attention and the irregular modes of study they became habituated
to in their school-boy days. Hence the mischief of long vacations, and the evil of beginning
studies before the age at which they may be understood. Parents and teachers should hence,
at an early period, impress indelibly upon the minds of their children and pupils the ever
true and practical sentiment, that what is worth doing at all is worth doing well. Although,
at first, their progress may seem to be retarded thereby, still, in the end, it will contribute
greatly to accelerate their real advancement, and in after life, whether employed in literary
or business pursuits, will be a means of augmenting their happiness and increasing their prospect
of success in whatever department of labor they may be engaged.

In physical education most persons seem well aware of the advantages of repetition. They know,
for instance, that if practice in dancing, fencing, skating, and riding is persevered in for
a sufficient length of time to give the muscles the requisite promptitude and harmony of action,
the power will be ever afterward retained, although rarely called into use. But if we stop
short of this point, we may reiterate practice by fits and starts without any proportional
advancement. The same principle is equally applicable to the moral and intellectual powers
which operate by means of material organs.

The impossibility of successfully playing the hypocrite for any considerable length of time,
and the necessity of being in private what we wish to appear in public, spring from the same
rule. If we wish to be ourselves polite, just, kind, and sociable, or to induce others to become
so, we must act habitually under the influence of the corresponding sentiments, in the domestic
circle, in the school-room, and in every-day life, as well as in the company of strangers and
on great occasions. It is the private and daily practice of individuals that gives ready activity
to the sentiments and marks the real character. If parents or teachers indulge habitually in
vulgarities of speech and behavior in the family or in the school, and put on politeness occasionally
for the reception and entertainment of strangers, their true character will shine through the
mask which is intended to conceal it. The habitual association to which the organs and faculties
have been accustomed can not thus be controlled. Parents hence, in addition to correct personal
influence in the family, should provide for their children teachers whose habits and character
are in all respects what they are willing their children should form. If they neglect to do
this, the utmost they can reasonably expect is that their children will become what the teacher is.

The principle that repetition is necessary in order to make a durable impression on the organ
of the mind, and thus constitute a mental habit, explains how natural endowments are modified
by external situation. The extent to which this modification may be carried, and is actually
carried in every community, is much greater than most persons are aware of. Take a child, for
example, of average propensities, sentiments, and intellect, and place him among a class of
people in whom the selfish faculties are exclusively exercised--a class who regard gain as
the end of life, and look upon cunning and cheating as legitimate means, and who never express
disapprobation or moral indignation against either crime or selfishness--and his lower faculties,
being exclusively exercised, will increase in strength, while the higher ones, remaining unemployed,
will become enfeebled. A child thus situated will, consequently, not only act as those around
him do, but insensibly grow up resembling them in disposition and character; for, by the law
of repetition, the organs of the selfish qualities will have acquired proportionally greater
aptitude and vigor, just as do the muscles of the fencer or dancer. But suppose the same individual
placed, from infancy, in the society of a superiorly endowed moral and intellectual people,
the moral faculties will then be habitually excited, and their organs invigorated by repetition,
till a greater aptitude will be induced in them, or, in other words, till a higher moral character
will be formed. The natural endowments of individuals set limits to these modifications of
character; but where original dispositions and tendencies are not strongly marked, the range
is very wide.

In the cultivation of the brain and mental faculties, each organ should be exercised directly
upon its own appropriate objects, and not merely roused or addressed through the medium of
another organ. When we wish to teach the graceful and rapid evolutions of fencing, we do not
content ourselves with merely giving directions, but our chief attention is employed in making
the muscles themselves go through the evolutions, till, by frequent repetition and correction,
they acquire the requisite quickness and precision of action. So, when we wish to teach music,
we do not merely address the understanding and explain the qualities of sounds. We train the
ear to an attentive discrimination of these sounds, and the hand or the vocal organs, as the
case may be, to the reproduction of the motions which call them into existence. We follow this
plan, because the laws of organization require the direct practice of the organs concerned,
and we feel instinctively that we can succeed only by obeying these laws. The purely mental
faculties are connected during life with material organs, and are hence subjected to precisely
the same laws. If, therefore, we wish to improve these faculties--the reasoning powers, for
example--we must exercise them regularly in tracing the cause and relations of things. In like
manner, if our aim is the development of the sentiments of attachment, benevolence, justice,
or respect, we must exercise each of them directly and for its own sake, otherwise neither
it nor its organ will ever acquire promptitude or strength.

It is the brain, or organ of the mind, more than the abstract immaterial principle itself,
that requires cultivation, or can, indeed, receive it in this life. Education hence operates
invariably in subjection to the laws of organization. In improving the external senses, we
admit this principle readily enough; but when we come to the internal faculties of thought
and feeling, it is either denied or neglected. That the superior quickness of touch, sight,
and hearing, consequent upon judicious exercise, is referable to increased facility of action
in their appropriate organs, is readily admitted. But when we explain, on the same principle,
the superior development of the reasoning powers, or the greater warmth of feeling produced
by similar exercise in these and other internal faculties, few are inclined to listen to our
proposition, or allow to it half the weight or attention its importance demands, although every
fact in philosophy and experience concurs in supporting it. We see the mental powers of feeling
and of thought unfolding themselves in infancy and youth in exact accordance with the progress
of the organization. We see them perverted or suspended by the sudden inroad of disease. We
sometimes observe every previous acquirement obliterated from the adult mind by fever or by
accident, leaving education to be commenced anew, as if it had never been; and yet, with all
these evidences of the organic influence, the proposition that the established laws of physiology,
as applied to the brain, should be considered our best and surest guide in education, seems
to many a novelty. Among the numerous treatises on education, there are very few volumes in
which it is even hinted that these laws have the slightest influence over either intellectual
or moral improvement.

As God has given us bones and muscles, and blood-vessels and nerves, for the purpose of being
used, let us not despise the gift, but consent at once to turn them to account, and to reap
health and vigor as the reward which he has associated with moderate labor. As he has given
us lungs to breathe with and blood to circulate, let us at once and forever abandon the folly
of shutting ourselves up with little intermission, whether engaged in study or other sedentary
occupations, and consent to inhale, copiously and freely, that wholesome atmosphere which his
benevolence has spread around us in such rich profusion. As he has given us appetites and organs
of digestion, let us profit by his bounty, and earn their enjoyment by healthful exercise in
some department of productive industry. As he has given us a moral and a social nature, which
is invigorated by activity, and impaired by solitude and restraint, let us cultivate good feelings,
and act toward each other on principles of kindness, justice, forbearance, and mutual assistance;
and as he has given us intellect, let us exercise it in seeking a knowledge of his works and
of his laws, and in tracing out the relation in which we stand toward him, toward our fellow-men,
and toward the various objects of the external world. In so doing, we may be well assured we
shall find a reward a thousand times more rich and pure, yea, infinitely more delightful and
enduring, than we can hope to experience in following our own blind devices, regardless of
his will and benevolent intentions toward us.

CHAPTER VI.

THE EDUCATION OF THE FIVE SENSES.

    If the eye be obstructed, the ear opens wide its portals, and hears
    your very emotions in the varying tones of your voice; if the ear be
    stopped, the quickened eye will almost read the words as they fall
    from your lips; and if both be close sealed up, the whole body
    becomes like a sensitive plant--the quickened skin perceives the
    very vibrations of the air, and you may even write your thoughts
    upon it, and receive answers from the sentient soul within.--ANNUAL
    REPORT of the Trustees of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts
    Asylum for the Blind, 1841.

He who formed man of the dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,
has honored his material organs by associating them with the immaterial soul. In this life
the senses constitute the great conveyances of knowledge to the human mind. It then becomes
not only a legitimate object of inquiry, but one which commends itself to every human being,
and especially to every parent and teacher, Can these senses be improved by human interference?
And if so, how can that improvement be best effected?

The senses are the interpreters between the material universe without and the spirit within.
Without the celestial machinery of sensation, man must have ever remained what Adam was before
the Almighty breathed into his form of clay the awakening breath of life. The dormant energies
of the mind can be aroused, and the soul can be put into mysterious communion with external
nature only by the magical power of sensation.

The possession of all the corporeal senses, and their systematic and judicious culture by all
proper appliances, are necessary in order to place man in such a relation to the material universe
and its great Architect as most fully and successfully to cultivate the varied capabilities
of his nature, and best to subserve the purposes of his creation. He who is deprived of the
healthful exercise of one or more of his senses, or, possessing them all unimpaired, has neglected
their proper culture, is, from the nature of the case, in a proportionate degree cut off from
a knowledge of God as manifested in his works, and from that happiness which is the legitimate
fruit of such knowledge.

Much light has been thrown upon this subject within a few years by the judicious labors of
that class of practical educators who have devoted their lives to the amelioration of the condition
of persons deprived of one or more of the senses. It is difficult to conceive the real condition
of the minds of persons thus situated, and especially while they remain uneducated. He who
is deprived of the sense of sight has the windows of his soul closed, and is effectually shut
out from this world of light and beauty. In like manner, he who is deprived of the sense of
hearing is excluded from the world of music and of speech. What, then, must be the condition
of persons deprived of both of these senses? How desolate and cheerless! Yet some such there are.

While on a visit to the Asylum for the Blind, in Boston, a few months ago, I met two of this
unfortunate class of persons--Laura Bridgman and Oliver Caswell. Laura has been several years
connected with the institution.

LAURA BRIDGMAN, the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Girl.--So remarkable is the case of this interesting
girl, so full of interest, so replete with instruction, and in every way so admirably adapted
to illustrate the subject of this chapter, that I proceed to give to my readers a sketch of
the method pursued in her instruction, together with the results attendant upon it. My information
in relation to her is derived from both personal acquaintance and the reports of her case,
though principally from the latter source.

Laura was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, on the 21st of December, 1829. She is described as
having been a very sprightly and pretty infant. During the first years of her existence she
held her life by the feeblest tenure, being subject to severe fits, which seemed to rack her
frame almost beyond the power of endurance. She even learned to sew a little and to knit.

Her affections, too, began to expand, and seemed to be lavished upon the members of her family
with peculiar force. But the means of communication with her were very limited. She could be
told to go to a place only by being pushed, or to come to one by a sign of drawing her. Patting
her gently on the head signified approbation, on the back disapprobation. She showed every
disposition to learn, and manifestly began to use a natural language of her own. She had a
sign to express her idea of each member of the family, as drawing her fingers down each side
of her face to allude to the whiskers of one, twirling her hand around in imitation of the
motion of a spinning-wheel for another, and so on. But, although Laura received all the aid
a kind mother could bestow, she soon began to give proof of the importance of language in the
development of human character. By the time she was seven years old the moral effects of her
privation began to appear, for there was no way of controlling her will but by the absolute
power of another, and at this humanity revolts.

At this time, Dr. Samuel G. Howe, the distinguished and successful director of the asylum,
learned of her situation, and hastened to see her. Here seemed a rare opportunity of trying
a plan for the education of a deaf and blind person, which the doctor had formed on seeing
Julia Brace at Hartford. The parents readily consented to her going to the institution in Boston,
where Laura was received in October, 1837, just before she had completed her eighth year. One
of two methods was to be adopted. Either the language of signs, on the basis of the natural
language she had already commenced herself, was to be built up, or it remained to teach her
the purely arbitrary language in common use. The former would have been easy, but very ineffectual.
The latter, although very difficult, if accomplished, would prove vastly superior. It was therefore
determined upon.

The blind learn to read by means of raised letters, which they gain a knowledge of by the sense
of feeling. The ends of the fingers, resting upon the raised letters, thus constitute, in part,
the eyes of the blind. This, although apparently difficult, becomes comparatively easy when
the blind person possesses the sense of hearing, and is thus enabled to become acquainted with
spoken language. On the contrary, the deaf, and consequently dumb, are unable to acquire a
knowledge of spoken language so as to use it with any degree of success. In their education,
hence, the language of signs, which can be addressed to the eye, is substituted for spoken
language. In communicating with one another, by means of the manual alphabet, they substitute
positions of the hand, which they can both make and see, for letters and words, which they
can neither pronounce nor hear.

To be deprived of either sight or hearing was formerly regarded as an almost insuperable obstacle
in the way of education. Persons deprived of both these senses have heretofore been considered
by high legal authorities,[23] as well as by public opinion, as occupying, of necessity, a
state of irresponsible and irrecoverable idiocy. By the education of the remaining senses,
however, this formidable and heretofore insuperable barrier has been overleaped, or, rather,
the obstacle has been met and overcome. The experiment has been successfully tried, once and
again, in our own country. The deaf and blind mute has not only acquired a knowledge of reading
and writing, and of the common branches of education, but has been enabled successfully to
prosecute the study of natural philosophy, of mental science, and of geometry. The accomplishment
of all this has resulted from the successful cultivation of the sense of touch or of feeling.
The raised letter of the blind has been used for written language, and the manual language
of the mute, taken by the finger-eyes of the blind, has been successfully substituted for spoken
language.

Laura's mind dwelt in darkness and silence. In order, therefore, to communicate to her a knowledge
of the arbitrary language in common use, it was necessary to combine the methods of instructing
the blind and the deaf. He saw at once that nothing but patient and persevering, but judicious
efforts were needed in her instruction, and that these would most assuredly be crowned with
success.

It is difficult to form a just conception of the amount of labor bestowed upon Laura thus far.
In communicating with her, spoken language could not be used, for she was destitute of hearing.
Neither are signs of any use when addressed to the eyes of the blind.

Six months after Laura had left home her mother went to visit her. The scene of their meeting
was full of interest. These were at once recognized by the child, who gave satisfactory indications
that she understood they were from home. The mother now tried to caress her; but Laura repelled
her, preferring to be with her acquaintances.

Other articles from home were then given to Laura, and she began to look much interested; she
examined the stranger much closer, and gave the doctor to understand she knew they came from
Hanover; she now even endured her mother's caresses, but would leave her with indifference
at the slightest signal.

The following facts are drawn from the report made of her case at the end of the year 1839,
after she had been a little more than two years under instruction. Having mastered the manual
alphabet of the deaf mutes, and having learned to spell readily the names of every thing within
her reach, she was then taught words expressive of positive qualities, as hardness and softness.
This was a very difficult process. She was next taught those expressions of relation to place
which she could understand. A ring, for example, was taken and placed on a box; then the words
were spelled to her, and she repeated them from imitation. The ring was afterward placed on
a hat, desk, etc. In a similar manner she learned the use of in, into, etc. She would illustrate
the use of these and other words as follows: She would spell ~on~, and then lay one hand on
the other; then she would spell ~into~, and inclose one hand within the other.

Laura very easily acquired a knowledge and use of active verbs, especially those expressive
of tangible action, as to walk, to run, to sew, to shake. In acquiring a knowledge of language,
she used the words with which she had become acquainted in a general sense, and according to
the order of her sense of ideas. Thus, in asking some one to give her bread, she would first
use the word expressive of the leading idea, and say, Bread, give, Laura. If she wanted water,
she would say, Water, drink, Laura.

Having acquired the use of substantives, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions,
it was thought time to make the experiment of trying to teach her to write, and to show her
she might communicate her ideas to persons not in contact with her. It was amusing to witness
the mute amazement with which she submitted to the process; the docility with which she imitated
every motion, and the perseverance with which she moved her pencil over and over again in the
same track, until she could form the letter. But when at last the idea dawned upon her that
by this mysterious process she could make other people understand what she thought, her joy
was boundless! Never did a child apply more eagerly and joyfully to any task than she did to
this; and in a few months she could make every letter distinctly, and separate words from each
other.

At this time Laura actually wrote, unaided, a legible letter to her mother, in which she expressed
the idea of her being well, and of her expectation of going home in a few weeks. It was, indeed,
a very rude and imperfect letter, couched in the language which a prattling infant would use.
Still, it shadowed forth and expressed to her mother the ideas that were passing in her own
mind. She had attained about the same command of language as common children three years of
age. But her power of expression was, of course, by no means equal to her power of conception;
for she had no words to express many of the perceptions and sensations which her mind doubtless
experienced. In the spring of 1840, when she had been under instruction about two and a half
years, returning fatigued from her journey home, she complained of a pain in her side, and
on being asked what caused it, she replied as follows: "Laura did go to see mother, ride did
make Laura side ache, horse was wrong, did not run softly." Her improvement in the use of language
was very rapid, and she soon became, in some respects, quite a critic. When one of the girls
had the mumps, Laura learned the name of the disease; soon after she had it herself, but she
had the swelling only on one side; and some one saying to her, "You have got the mumps," she
replied quickly, "No, no; I have mump."

About this time Laura learned the difference between the present and past tense of the verb.
And here her simplicity rebukes the clumsy irregularities of our language. She learned jump,
jumped--walk, walked, etc., until she had an idea of the mode of forming the imperfect tense
of regular verbs; but when she came to the word see, she insisted that it should be seed in
the imperfect; and upon going down to dinner, she asked if it was eat, eated; but being told
it was eat, ATE, she seemed to try to express the idea that this transposition of the letters
was not only wrong, but ludicrous, for she laughed heartily. She continued this habit of forming
words analogically. When she had become acquainted with the meaning of the word restless, she
seemed to understand that less at the end of a word means without, destitute of, or wanting,
as rest-less, fruit-less; also that ful at the end of a word expresses abundance of what is
implied by the primitive, as bliss-ful, play-ful. This is clearly illustrated in the following
expressions. One day, feeling weak, she said, "I am very strongless." Being told this was not
right, she said, "Why, you say restless when I do not sit still." Then she said, "I am very
weakful."

My primary object in referring to Laura has been to illustrate, in a striking manner, the practicability
of the education of the senses to an extent not heretofore generally known. To such an extent
has the sense of touch been cultivated in her, that her fingers serve as very good substitutes
for both eyes and ears. I will mention one or two instances which strikingly illustrate the
acuteness of Laura's sense of touch. When I was at the institution a few months ago, she was
told a person was present whom she had never met, and who wished an introduction to her. She
reached her hand, expecting to meet a stranger. By mistake (for her teachers design never to
allow her to be deceived), she took the hand of another gentleman, whom she recognized immediately,
though she had never met him but twice before. She recognizes her acquaintances in an instant
by touching their hands or their dress, and there are probably hundreds of individuals who,
if they were to stand in a row, and hold out each a hand to her, would be recognized by that
alone. The memory of these sensations is very vivid, and she will readily recognize a person
whom she has once thus touched. Many cases of this kind have been noticed; such as a person
shaking hands with her, and making a peculiar pressure with one finger, and repeating this
on his second visit, after a lapse of many months, being instantly known by her. She has been
known to recognize persons with whom she had thus simply shaken hands but once, after a lapse
of six months. But this is hardly more wonderful than that one should be able to recall impressions
made upon the mind through the organ of sight, as when we recognize a person of whom we have
had but one glimpse a year before; but it shows the exhaustless capacity of those organs which
the Creator has bestowed, as it were, in reserve against accidents, and which we too commonly
allow to lie unused and unvalued.

OLIVER CASWELL.--Had I not devoted so much space to this subject already, it would be interesting
to consider the case of Oliver, who, like Laura, is deaf, dumb, and blind. His experience is
full of interest, though less striking than that already presented. His progress in learning
language, and in acquiring intellectual knowledge, is comparatively slow, because he has not
that fineness of fiber and that activity of temperament which enable Laura to struggle so successfully
against the immense disadvantages under which they both labor. Oliver is a boy of rather unfavorable
organization; he had been deaf and blind from infancy; he received no instruction until he
was twelve years old, and consequently lost the most precious years for learning; he has nevertheless
been taught to express his thoughts both by the finger language and by writing; he has also
become acquainted with the rudiments of the common branches of education, and is intelligent
and morally responsible. His case proves, therefore, very clearly, that the success of the
attempt made to instruct Laura Bridgman was not owing solely to her uncommon capacity.

Oliver's natural ability is small, and his acquired knowledge very limited; but his sense of
right and wrong, his obedience to moral obligations, and his attachment to friends, are very
remarkable.[24] He never willfully violates the rights or injures the feelings of others, and
seldom shows any signs of temper when his own seem to be invaded. He even bears the teasing
of little boys with gentleness and patience. He is very tractable, and always obeys respectfully
the requests of his teacher. This shows the effect which kind and gentle treatment has had
upon his character, for when he first went to the institution in Boston he was sometimes very
willful, and showed occasional outbursts of temper which were fearfully violent. "It seems
hardly possible," says Dr. Howe, "that the gentle and affectionate youth, who loves all the
household and is beloved by all in return, should be the same who a few years ago scratched
and bit, like a young savage, those who attempted to control him."

  [24] I have omitted much in the case of Laura that I should have
  retained but for want of room. The moral qualities of her nature have
  developed themselves most clearly. She is honest to a proverb, having
  never been known to take any thing belonging to another. That she is a
  Christian there can be no doubt. It is said in the report of her case
  for 1846, that "on the last occasion of her manifesting any impatience,
  she said to Miss Wight, her teacher, 'I felt cross, but in a minute I
  thought of Christ, how good and gentle he was, and my bad feelings went
  away.'"

We regard it as a fact fully established that the sense of touch may be cultivated to a much
greater extent than most persons are aware of. The same remark will apply to the cultivation
of all the senses. We shall consider them separately.

THE SENSE OF TOUCH.--The remarks already made apply chiefly to this sense. The nerves that
supply it proceed from the anterior half of the spinal cord. This sense is most delicate where
there are the greatest number of nervous filaments, and those of the largest size. The hands,
and especially the fingers, have a most delicate and nice sense of touch, though the sense
is extended over the whole body, in every part of which it is less or more acute. In this respect,
then, this sense is unlike the others, which are confined to small spaces, as we shall see
when we come to consider them. The action of the sensitive nerves depends upon the state of
the brain, and the condition of the system generally. In sound and perfect sleep, when the
brain is inactive, ordinary impressions made upon the skin are unobserved. Fear and grief diminish
the impressibility of this tissue, while hope and joy increase it. The quantity and quality
of the blood also influence sensation. If this vital fluid becomes impure, or its quantity
is diminished, the sensibility of the skin will be impaired thereby. Whatever affects the general
health affects the healthy action of this sense. It is also much affected by sudden changes
in temperature. If the skin is wounded while under the influence of cold, the pain will be
slight. By carrying this chilling influence too far, the surface becomes entirely destitute
of sensation. This is produced by the contraction of the blood-vessels upon the surface. On
the contrary, when the chilled extremities are suddenly exposed to heat, the rapid enlargement
of the contracted blood-vessels excites the nerves unduly, which causes the pain experienced
on such occasions.

The sensibility of the nerves depends much upon the habits of persons. Suppose two boys go
out to play when the thermometer stands at the freezing point, and that one of them has been
accustomed to exercise in the open air, and to practice daily ablution, while the other one
has been confined most of the time to a warm room, and has been accustomed to wash only his
hands and face. The skin of the former, other things being equal, will be active and healthy,
while that of the latter will be enfeebled and diseased. The organs of touch diffused over
the body at the surface will be very differently affected in these two boys, and the perceptions
of their minds will be alike dissimilar. One will be roused to action, and will feel just right
for some animating game. Both body and mind will be elastic and joyous. He will bound like
the roe, make the welkin ring with his merry shout, and return to the bosom of his family with
a gladdened heart, ready to impart and receive pleasure, while the other boy will be too keenly
affected by the contact of the air, and think it too cold to stay out of doors. He will thrust
his hands into his pockets, and curl himself up like one decrepit with age. His teeth will
chatter and his whole frame tremble. Of course, very different reflections will be awakened
in his mind. He will hurry back to the fireside, thinking winter a very dismal season, and
will be apt to fret himself and all about him, because of the confinement from which he has
not the resolution to break out.

The sensibility of the cutaneous nerves in these two cases depends upon the habits of the persons.
If the latter would practice frequent ablutions, and excite a healthy action in the skin by
friction and exercise, and conform to other laws of health, he would experience all that gladness
of heart, and elasticity of body and mind, which the other is supposed to enjoy. Hence the
advantages resulting from a strict conformity to the laws of health in this particular as well
as in others that are generally regarded as more important.

The general law that the exercise of a faculty increases its power is applicable to the senses.
We have referred to the blind, who read as rapidly as seeing persons by passing their fingers
over raised letters, the sense of touch being substituted by them for that of vision. Nor is
the education of this sense useful to the blind merely. It may frequently be appealed to with
great advantage by all who have cultivated it. The miller, for example, can judge more accurately
of the quality of flour and meal, by passing some between his fingers than by the exercise
of vision. The cloth-dresser, also, by the aid of this sense, not only marks the nicest shades
of texture in examining cloths of different qualities, but in many instances learns to distinguish
colors by the sense of touch with perhaps greater accuracy than is common with seeing persons.

THE SENSE OF TASTE.--The sense of taste bears the greatest resemblance to the sense of feeling.
The upper surface of the tongue is the principal agent in tasting, though the lips, the palate,
and the internal surface of the cheeks participate in this function, as does the upper part
of the oesophagus. The multitude of points called papillæ, scattered over the upper surface
of the tongue, constitute the more immediate seat of this sense. It is in these sensitive papillæ
that the ramifications of the gustatory or tasting nerves terminate. When fluids are taken
into the mouth, and especially those whose taste is pungent, these papillæ dilate and erect
themselves, and the particular sensation produced is transmitted to the brain through the medium
of the minute filaments of the gustatory nerves.

In order fully to gratify the taste in eating dry, solid food, it is necessary that the food
be first reduced to a liquid state, or, at least, that it be thoroughly moistened. Nature has
made full provision for this in furnishing the mouth with salivary glands, whose secretions
are most abundant when engaged in masticating dry, hard substances. These quickened secretions
contribute to gratify the taste and increase the pleasure of eating, and, at the same time,
materially aid in the important processes of mastication and digestion. Nature, also, with
her accustomed bounty, has furnished man with a great variety of articles for food. By this
means the various tastes of different persons may be gratified, although, in many instances,
those articles of food which are most agreeable to some persons are extremely disagreeable
to others.

Many persons can not eat the most nourishing food, as fruits, butter, etc., because to them
the taste of these articles is disagreeable. But this is very easily accounted for, as in the
mouth the food mixes with various fluids that differ in different persons, and in the same
person at different times. These fluids, and particularly the saliva, assist in the formation
and change of taste. This accounts not only for the different tastes of different persons,
but also for the varying taste of the same persons, and for that fickleness of taste which
is so common in sickness, when the fluids of the mouth, in a disordered and deranged state,
mix with the food, and produce the disagreeable taste so often complained of at such times,
and which, moreover, occasionally create a permanent dislike for food that was previously much
relished.

This sense was given to men and animals to guide them in the selection of their food, and to
enable them to guard against the use of articles that would be injurious if introduced into
the stomach. In the inferior animals, the sense of taste still answers the original design
of its bestowment; but in man, it has been abused and perverted by the use of artificial stimulants,
which have created an acquired taste that, in most persons, is very detrimental to health.
This sense is so modified by habit, that, not unfrequently, articles which were at first exceedingly
offensive, become, at length, highly agreeable. It is in this manner that many persons, whose
sense of taste has been impaired or perverted, have formed the disgusting and ruinous habits
of smoking and chewing tobacco, and of using stimulating and intoxicating drinks. But these
pernicious habits, and all similar indulgences, lessen the sensibility of the gustatory nerve,
and ultimately destroy the natural relish for healthful food and drink. By this means, also,
the digestive powers become disordered, and the general health is materially impaired. All
persons, then, should seek to preserve the natural integrity of this sense, and to restore
it immediately to healthy action when at all depraved, for upon this depends much of health
and longevity, of happiness and usefulness.

This sense may be rendered very acute by cultivation, as is illustrated by persons who are
accustomed to taste medicines, liquors, teas, etc. It ought, however, to be chiefly exercised
in partaking of those simple articles of food and drink which are most conducive to health.
In its natural state it prefers these, and if depraved it will soon recover a healthy tone,
if not continually tempted by stimulating substances. This is beautifully illustrated in thousands
of instances all over our country by persons who were once accustomed to use strong drink,
but who have substituted for it sparkling water, a beverage prepared by God himself to nourish
and invigorate his creatures, and beautify his footstool.

THE SENSE OF SMELL.--The sense of taste has received a faithful companion in that of smell.
The beneficent Creator, with that wisdom which characterizes all his works, has very wisely
placed the organ of this sense just above the mouth, in order that the scent of many things
that are hurtful may warn us from partaking of them before they reach the mouth. The air-passages
of the nose, in which this sense is located, are lined with a thin skin, called the mucous
membrane, which is continuous with the lining membrane of the parts of the throat and of the
external skin. Upon this membrane the olfactory nerve ramifies. The odoriferous particles of
matter that float in the air come in contact with these fine and sensitive nerves as the air
rushes through the nostrils, and the impression is conveyed to the brain by the olfactory nerve.
The mucous membrane, upon which this ramifies, is of considerable extent in man. In the lower
animals it is less or more extensive, according to the degree of acuteness of this sense. This
membrane is full of little glands that are continually giving off thick mucus, and especially
when the membrane is inflamed. There is a small canal leading from the eyes to the nose, through
which a fluid, that also forms tears, is constantly passing when the passage is clear. It is
the office of this fluid to moisten and thin the mucus of the nose. When this mucous is too
abundant, as in some stages of a cold, and especially if it becomes dry from the closing of
the canal leading from the eyes, or from any other cause, as fever, the sense of smell will
be greatly impaired, if not entirely suspended. It is, indeed, not unfrequently permanently
injured in this way, and sometimes is irrecoverably lost.

The sensation of smell, it should be borne in mind, is produced by a kind of odoriferous vapor,
very fine and invisible, that flies off from nearly all bodies. The air which contains this
vapor is drawn into the nose, and is in this way brought into contact with the very delicate
nerves of smell that ramify the membrane which lines the air-passages of this organ. It is
only when the exceedingly small particles of which the odor of various bodies is composed come
in contact with the minute ramifications of the olfactory nerve that this sensation is produced.
In order to protect these sensitive nerves, as well as to prevent the introduction into the
lungs of injurious substances, the air-passages of the nose are furnished with hairy appendages,
which are less or more abundant according to the size of these passages. These intercept any
foreign substances that enter the nose, and thus irritate the mucous membrane, and cause a
quick and powerful contraction of the diaphragm, by which the offending matter is immediately
expelled. This phenomenon, which is called sneezing, depends upon a connection of the olfactory
with the respiratory nerves.

This sense not only comes in to the aid of taste in enabling man and the lower animals to select
proper food, and avoid that which is injurious, but it also gives us positive and varied pleasure
by the inhalation of agreeable odors, while, at the same time, it enables us to avoid an infectious
atmosphere, and all objects whose odors are offensive and hurtful.

It is true that man can accustom himself to nearly all kinds of odor, even to those that at
first are very disagreeable. He indeed not unfrequently so vitiates the sense of smell as actually
to prefer those scents which, to persons who have preserved the integrity of this sense, are
regarded as exceedingly offensive, and even filthy. But why, let me ask, did the Creator give
us the sense of smell? Was it to be thus perverted? No, indeed: it was, without doubt, that
we might enjoy the refreshing fragrance of flowers and herbs, of food and drink; and also that
we might distinguish between air that is pure and healthful, and that which is impure and infectious.
As most articles of food which are agreeable to the smell are wholesome, and as those which
are disagreeable are generally unwholesome, so, also, those states of the atmosphere which
are grateful to this sense are salubrious, and those odors which are pleasant are healthful,
while air which is ungrateful will generally be found injurious to health, as will also all
those odors which are unpleasant to this sense when in a healthful state. He who has had occasion
to enter a crowded court-room, lecture-room, church, or assembly-room of whatever kind, which
has been occupied for a considerable time without adequate ventilation, can not fail to remember
the unwelcome impression made upon his nasal organs when first he inhaled the vitiated atmosphere
within, though by degrees he might have become accustomed to it, did he remain, so as ultimately
to become well-nigh insensible to its noisome influence. But let such and all others be well
assured that, however offensive such a fetid atmosphere may be to the smell, it is equally
injurious to the health. And let those who, having returned from a morning walk or healthful
exercise in a salubrious atmosphere, have had occasion to revisit the small and unventilated
lodging-room in which they spent a restless night without refreshing sleep, perceive, in the
sickening smell, a sufficient cause for all their pains and aches, and wonder how they survived
such a gross violation of the organic laws.

All of the senses may be improved by education. The sense of smell constitutes no exception
to this rule. Let none be discouraged, then; for the more we accustom our lungs and nasal organs
to pure air, the more will they require it, and the more readily will they detect the presence
of the least impurity.

This sense becomes very acute in deaf persons, and even more so in the case of those that are
blind. The reason is obvious; for, as they are led of necessity to rely upon it more than persons
who have all the senses, it becomes thereby developed, and is enabled more accurately to judge
of the properties of whatever is submitted to its scrutiny. Seeing persons rarely partake of
any article of food, and especially of any thing new, without first smelling it, and blind
persons never; for this is the only means by which they can judge of its wholesomeness or unwholesomeness
without tasting it.

Whatever stupefies the brain, impairs the healthy action of the nerve of smell, or thickens
the membrane that lines the nasal cavities, and thus diminishes the sensibility of the nerves
ramified upon it, injures this sense. All these effects are produced by the habitual use of
snuff, which, when introduced into the nose, diminishes the sensibility of the nerves, and
thickens the lining membrane. By its use the air-passages through the nostrils sometimes become
completely obstructed. It is on this account that most habitual snuff-takers are compelled
to open their mouths in order to breathe freely. It has been well said, that if Nature had
intended that the nose should be used as a snuff-hole, she would doubtless have put it on the
other end up.

THE SENSE OF HEARING.--The external ear, although curiously shaped, is not the most important
part of the organ whose function it is to take cognizance of sounds. In the transmission of
sound to the brain, the vibrations of the air produced by the sonorous body are collected by
the external ear, and conducted through the auditory canal to the drum of the ear, which is
so arranged that it may be relaxed or tightened like the head of an ordinary drum. That its
motion may be free, the air contained within the drum has free communication with the external
air by an open passage, called the Eustachian tube, leading to the back of the mouth. This
tube is sometimes obstructed by wax, when a degree of deafness ensues. But when the obstruction
is removed in the effort of sneezing or otherwise, a crack or sudden noise is generally experienced,
accompanied usually with an immediate return of acute hearing.

The ear-drum performs a two-fold office; for while it aids in the transmission of sound from
without to the internal ear, it at the same time modifies the intensity of sound. This softening
of the sound is effected by the relaxation of a muscle when sounds are so acute as to be painful;
but when listening to low sounds, the drum is rendered tense by the contraction of this muscle,
and the sounds become, by this means, more audible. The vibrations made on the drum are transmitted
by the tympanum--an irregular bony cavity--to the internal ear, which is filled with a watery
fluid. In this fluid the filaments of the auditory nerve terminate, which receive and transmit
the sound to the brain.

The ear has the power of judging of the direction from which sound comes, as is strikingly
exemplified in the fact that when horses or mules march in company at night, those in front
direct their ears forward, and those in the rear turn them backward, while those in the center
turn them laterally or across, the whole troop seeming to be actuated by a feeling to watch
the common safety. This is also illustrated by four or six horse teams, and is a fact with
which coachmen are familiar. It is further illustrated by the dog, and many other animals.
The external ear of man is likewise furnished with muscles; and savages are said to have the
power of moving or directing their ears at pleasure, like a horse, to catch sounds as they
come from different directions; but few men in civilized life retain this power.

The acuteness of this sense in men and animals, other things being equal, depends upon the
size of the ear. In timid animals, as the hare and the rabbit, the ear is very large. They
are thus apprized of the approach of an enemy in time to flee to a place of safety.

The ear-trumpet--which is a tube wide at one end, where the sound enters, and narrow at the
other, where the ear is applied--is constructed on this principle, its sides being so curved
that, according to the law of reflection, all the sound which enters it is brought to a focus
in the narrow end. It thus increases many fold the intensity of a sound which reaches the ear
through it, and enables a person who has become deaf to common conversation to mix again with
pleasure in society. The concave hand held behind the ear answers in some degree the purpose
of an ear-trumpet.

The Ear of Dionysius, in the dungeons of Syracuse, was a notorious instance of a sound-collecting
surface. The roof of the prison was so formed as to collect the words, and even whispers, of
the unhappy prisoners, and to direct them along a hidden conduit to where the tyrant sat listening.

Acuteness of hearing requires the healthy action of the brain, and particularly of that portion
of it from which the auditory nerve proceeds, combined with perfection in the structure and
functions of the different parts of the ear. The best method, then, of retaining and improving
the hearing, is to observe well the general laws of health, and particularly to avoid every
thing that will in the least impair the structure or healthy action of the parts immediately
concerned in the exercise of this function. Inflammatory fevers, affections of the brain, and
injuries upon the head, are among the more common causes of imperfect hearing. Hence the impropriety
of striking children upon the head in correcting them, whether in the family or in the school.
The instances are not few in which deafness, and the impairing of the mental faculties, have
resulted from that barbarous practice familiarly known as "boxing the ears." This inhuman practice
is likely to result in injury to the drum of the ear, either in thickening this membrane, or
in diminishing its vibratory character. Inflammation of the ear-drum, either acute or chronic,
is the common cause of its increased thickness. How often this is produced by blows, the reader
may judge. Diminution of the vibratory character of the ear-drum may result from an accumulation
of wax upon its outer surface. In such cases chronic inflammation of the parts is not unfrequently
the result of the injudicious practice of attempting its removal by introducing the heads of
pins into the ear.

This wax, it should be known, is designed to subserve an important end; for the tube leading
from the external ear, being, like the nose, constantly open, is liable to the entrance of
foreign bodies, such as dust, insects, and the like. But, fortunately, it is not left without
the means of defense; for on its inside there are numerous fine bristles, which, interlacing
each other, interpose a barrier to the entrance of every thing but sound. Moreover, between
the roots of these hairs there are numerous little glands, that secrete a nauseous, bitter
wax, which, by its offensiveness, either deters insects from entering, or entangles them and
prevents their advance in case they do enter. This wax, then, is very serviceable. But its
usefulness does not stop here. When the ear becomes dry from a deficiency of it, the hearing
becomes imperfect, as also when it is thin and purulent. This wax not unfrequently becomes
hard and obstructs the tube, causing less or more deafness. But this form of deafness may be
easily cured, even though it has existed for years; for, having softened the accumulations
of viscid wax by dropping animal oil into the ear, they may be removed by the injection of
warm soap-suds, which is an effectual and safe remedy.

The sense of hearing is perhaps as susceptible of cultivation as any of the senses. The Indian
in the forest, who is accustomed to listen to the approach of his enemies or of his prey, acquires
such acuteness of hearing as to be able to detect sounds that would be inaudible to persons
living amid the din of civilized life. The blind, also, who of necessity are led to rely more
upon this sense than seeing persons, excel in the acuteness of their hearing. They recognize
their acquaintances by the exercise of this sense as readily as persons usually do by that
of sight, an attainment which very few seeing persons make, and yet one that is perhaps within
the reach of ninety-nine persons in every hundred. The blind judge with great accuracy the
distance of persons in conversation, of carriages in motion, and of all sonorous bodies whose
vibrations reach their ears. They even estimate with remarkable correctness the distance and
height of buildings by the reflection or interception of sound. It is in consequence of the
acuteness of this sense, acquired by careful cultivation, that the blind, as a class, have
become so generally and justly distinguished for their pre-eminence in instrumental music.
This enables them also to cultivate vocal music with more than ordinary success.

The due cultivation of the sense of hearing will contribute vastly to promote our intellectual
and moral well-being. If it be true, as we are told it is by those who have been engaged in
teaching both the deaf and the blind, that the absence of hearing is even a more formidable
impediment to the communication of knowledge than that of sight, we must infer that all imperfections
of the organ of hearing itself, or in the manner of using it, must correspondingly lessen the
accuracy of the knowledge we receive through that organ. The meaning of language very often
is conveyed not so much by the words themselves as in the tones of voice in which the words
are uttered. If, therefore, the hearing be indistinct, or there be no habit formed of careful
attention to the inflections of sound, the impressions received from what we hear must often
be inaccurate. Our speech, too, will be far less agreeable, and be inefficient, even if it
be not positively inarticulate. We owe it to others, no less than to ourselves, then, to cultivate
the powers of the voice--the common instrument that God has given us for the interchange of
thought, sentiment, and feeling, and which, though so common, is the most perfect of all instruments
for the transmission of sound. Yet how deplorably is it neglected! how shamefully is it misused!
It can be fully developed and made what it is capable of being only through the influence of
the ear. If this organ be neglected, the voice must needs be imperfect. And the voices of many
persons are through life imperfect and disagreeable, because they were not carefully trained
in early life to articulate distinctly, much less to utter musical sounds. The opinion is confidently
expressed by those who are best qualified to decide the matter, that nearly all children might
be taught to sing, if proper attention were paid early enough to the use they make of their
ears and their organs of sound. The careful training of these should be considered an indispensable
part of a school-teacher's as well as of a parent's duty.

The ear will find appropriate discipline in distinguishing, without aid from the eye, the causes
of various sounds, as the opening of a door, the shutting of a knife, the dropping of various
coins, the moving of different articles of furniture, etc. It may also find appropriate exercise
in determining the direction from which various sounds proceed; in recognizing acquaintances
by their natural voices, and in detecting the counterfeit voices of companions; in arranging
and classifying the elementary sounds of the language, and in determining all the different
musical tones; in judging of the genus and species of birds by their chirping, of the distance
and nature of sonorous bodies of various kinds, etc., etc. These are some of the direct means
of improving this sense: others will suggest themselves to the thoughtful reader.

THE SENSE OF SIGHT.--The sense of sight, which is the most refined and admirable of all the
senses, still remains to be considered. The senses generally serve as interpreters between
the material universe without and the spirit within. But it is more especially by the sense
of sight that we are enabled to hold converse with the external world. Without it we should
be deprived of a large portion of the pleasures of life not only, but even of the means of
maintaining our existence. It is through the sense of vision that the wisdom, power, and benevolence
of the Deity are chiefly manifested to us.

I shall describe the apparatus of vision only so far as is necessary in order to subserve my
leading object, which is the preservation and improvement of this sense, and the means of rendering
it tributary to intellectual and moral culture. The eye, which is the organ of vision, is an
optical instrument of the most perfect construction. It is surrounded by coats, which contain
refracting mediums, called humors. There are three coats, called the sclerotic, the choroid,
and the retina; and three humors, called the aqueous, the crystalline, and the vitreous.

The sclerotic or outer coat, called also the white of the eye, is an opaque, fibrous membrane.
It has almost the firmness of leather, possesses little sensibility, and is rarely exposed
to inflammation or other diseases. It invests the eye on every side except the front, and besides
maintaining its globular form and preserving its internal and delicate structure, serves for
the attachment of those muscles which move this organ. The opening in the fore part of this
opaque coat is filled by the transparent cornea, which resembles a watch crystal in shape,
and is received into a groove in the front part of the sclerotic coat in the same manner that
a watch-glass is received into its case. But for this arrangement light could not gain admission
to the eye.

The choroid coat, which constitutes the second investing membrane of the eye, is of a dark
brown color upon its outer surface, and of a deep black within. The internal surface of this
membrane secretes a dark substance resembling black paint, upon which the retina is spread
out, and which is of great importance in the function of vision, as it seems to absorb the
rays of light immediately after they have struck upon the sensible surface of the retina.

The retina, which is the third and innermost membrane of the eye, is the expansion of the optic
nerve, and constitutes the immediate seat of vision. Such is the arrangement of the humors
of the eye, and so perfectly are they adapted to the functions they are called upon to perform,
that in the healthy state of this organ, the light entering the pupil is so refracted as to
paint upon the retina an exact image of the objects from which it proceeds. The optic nerve,
whose expansion forms the retina, receives this image and transmits it to the mind.

Arnott has well remarked, that "a whole printed sheet of a newspaper may be represented on
the retina on less surface than that of a finger nail; and yet not only shall every word and
letter be separately perceivable, but even any imperfection of a single letter. Or, more wonderful
still, when at night an eye is turned up to the blue vault of heaven, there is portrayed on
the little concave of the retina the boundless concave of the sky, with every object in its
just proportions. There a moon in beautiful miniature may be sailing among her white-edged
clouds, and surrounded by a thousand twinkling stars, so that to an animalcule supposed to
be within and near the pupil, the retina might appear another starry firmament with all its glory."

Besides these three coats, and the cornea which constitutes about one fifth of the anterior
portion of the outer coat, it is necessary to notice the iris, so called from its variety of
color in different persons, and upon which alone the color of the eye depends. The iris is
a circular membrane situated just behind the cornea, and is attached to one of the coats at
its circumference. In its center is a small round hole, called the pupil; and sometimes spoken
of familiarly as the sight of the eye, as no light can enter the eye except through it. The
iris possesses the power of dilating and contracting, so as to admit more or less light, as
it may be needed. This change in the size of the pupil is effected by two sets of muscular
fibers. The first set converge from the circumference of the iris to the circular margin of
the pupil, and constitute the radiated muscle. The outer ends of these fibers are attached
to the sclerotic coat, which is unyielding; hence, when they contract, the pupil enlarges to
receive more light. The other set is composed of circular fibers, which go round in the iris
from the border to the pupil, and constitute the orbicular muscle, the contraction of which
diminishes the size of the pupil. When too much light enters the eye, the excited and sensitive
retina immediately gives warning of the danger, and the nerves, which are plentifully distributed
to the iris, stimulate the orbicular muscle to contract, and the radiated one to relax, by
which the size of the pupil is lessened. But when the light which enters the pupil is insufficient
to transmit a distinct image of objects to the brain, the orbicular muscle relaxes, and the
radiated one contracts, so as to enlarge the pupil. The contraction of the pupil is readily
seen when a person passes from a darkened room into a bright sunlight, or when a light is first
brought into a room in the twilight of evening. Any person may notice this contraction in his
own eye by beholding himself in a glass immediately after passing from a dark to a well-lighted
room. So, also, when a person looks at an object near the eye, the pupil contracts, but when
he looks at an object more remote, it dilates. The muscles of the iris are somewhat under the
control of the will; for most persons can contract or dilate the pupil, in some degree, at
pleasure. Some persons possess this faculty to a great extent.

The three humors of the eye have been compared to the glasses of a telescope, and the coats
to the tube, which keeps them in their places. The aqueous humor is situated in the fore part
of the eye, and is divided by the iris into what are called the anterior and posterior chambers
of the eye. The crystalline humor, or lens, is situated immediately behind the aqueous humor,
a short distance back of the pupil, and is a perfectly transparent double convex lens, closely
resembling in shape the common burning glass. This resemblance does not stop here; for this
lens, like the burning glass, possesses the property of converging the rays of light which
fall upon it, and bringing them to a focus. When this lens becomes so opaque as to obstruct
the passage of light, either partially or entirely, a person is said to have a cataract. This
can be cured only by a surgical operation. The vitreous humor, situated back of the other two,
forms the principal part of the globe of the eye. It differs from the aqueous in one important
particular. When that is discharged in extracting the crystalline lens for cataract or otherwise,
it will be restored again in a few hours, and the eye will continue to perform its function.
But if this be discharged by accident, the eye is irrecoverably lost. This, however, does not
often occur; for, as we shall presently see, the eye is admirably fortified.

The eye is a perfect optical instrument, infinitely surpassing all specimens of human skill.
This is true, view it in what light we may. It not only possesses the power of so adjusting
its parts as to adapt it to the examination of objects at different distances, and in light
of different degrees of intensity, but we are enabled to direct it at will to objects above,
beneath, or around us.

The various motions of the eye are produced by six little muscles. These are attached at one
extremity to the immovable bones of the orbit, while at the other extremity they are inserted
into the sclerotic coat, four of them near its junction with the cornea, by broad, thin tendons,
which give to the white of the eye its pearly appearance. These muscles are so arranged by
the matchless skill of the Architect as to enable the beholder to direct the eye to any object
he chooses, and to hold it there for any length of time that is compatible with the laws by
which muscular exercise should be regulated. By the slight or intense action of four of these,
called the straight muscles, the eye is less or more compressed, and the relative positions
of its humors are by this means so nicely adjusted as to enable us to view objects near by
or at a distance. The other two are called oblique muscles, one of which, with its long tendon
passing through a cartilaginous loop, acts upon the principle of the fixed pulley, and turns
the eye in a direction contrary to its own action. When the external muscle becomes too short,
the eye turns out; but if the internal muscle is unduly contracted, the eye turns inward, toward
the nose. One eye is sometimes turned up or down, but this is of less frequent occurrence.

It would be interesting to notice the protecting organs of the eye, consisting of the orbit,
which is a deep bony socket, in which the eye securely rests; of the eye-brows, which are two
projecting arches, covered with hair, and so arranged as to prevent the moisture that accumulates
upon the forehead, in free perspiration, from flowing into the eye; of the eye-lids, which
are two movable curtains for the protection of the eye, and which secrete a fluid that moistens
and lubricates it; of the lachrymal gland, with its ducts, which keeps the eye constantly moist,
and whose secretions go on while we wake and when we sleep, etc., etc.; but the preceding must
suffice.

With this brief description of the apparatus of vision, we proceed to the consideration of
the means of preserving and improving this sense, and of rendering it tributary to intellectual
and moral culture.

The rule requiring that action should alternate with rest, which has been so often stated,
and which applies to all the organs of both body and mind, should be especially observed in
relation to the eye. This organ requires exercise, and light is its appropriate stimulus; but
injury is the inevitable consequence of keeping it too constantly employed, or too intently
fixed for a long time on any object. Whenever the eye is fixed for any length of time upon
an object which it distinguishes with difficulty, it experiences a painful sensation, which
is a sure indication that it has been overtaxed. The sight is also impaired when the eye is
too little used, or when its natural stimulus is shut out, as is strikingly illustrated in
the case of persons confined in dungeons. A distinguished oculist has said that many men daily
impair or destroy their eyes by immoderate use, and that not a few have done the same by too
little use of them.

The exposure of the eyes to sudden transitions from weak to strong light is very injurious.
This may be regarded as one of the must prolific causes of weakness of sight. The injury is
generally gradual, it is true, but it is none the less fatal on that account. The immediate
sensation of pain, when a strong light is brought into a dark room, should be a sufficient
warning to avoid such sudden extremes. The iris dilates and contracts, and thus enlarges or
diminishes the size of the pupil as the light that fails upon the eye is faint or strong; but
this dilation and contraction are not instantaneous. There are numerous instances on record
in which total blindness has resulted from a sudden transition from darkness to the brilliancy
of day. The habit of looking at a bright light of any kind, and especially of watching flashes
of lightning, which is practiced by many, is exceedingly dangerous. The practice which many
students and others indulge in, of resting their eyes as the twilight of evening advances,
and allowing the pupil to dilate until it is quite dark, and then suddenly introducing a bright
light, is a palpable violation of this rule, and one that is sure, sooner or later, sensibly
to injure the eyes. The exposure of the eyes suddenly to a strong light upon waking from sleep,
and all sudden changes of whatever kind from darkness to intense light, should be carefully
avoided by persons who would preserve their sight unimpaired.

The strength of light used should be regulated according to the powers of the eye. This is
a general, though a very important rule. Both the amount and the distribution of light should
be such as to produce no unpleasant sensations. The eye possesses a certain degree of adaptation
to light, according as it is intense or feeble. Some eyes require a stronger light than others,
but all eyes are injured by being used in light that is too intense or too feeble. Reading
by a strong sunlight, and by moon or star light, may be adduced as illustrations which are
alike painful and injurious.

Too little light is well-nigh as injurious as too much, as he can not fail to have noticed
who has had occasion to travel a difficult road in a dark night. The injury, in such cases,
is two-fold; for while, on the one hand, the radiated muscle of the iris is unduly contracted
for a length of time, in order sufficiently to enlarge the pupil to render objects visible,
the sensitive retina, on the other hand, is overtaxed to gain a knowledge of them in too feeble
light. The pain which the strained eye thus experiences is only an indication and a warning
to the individual of the permanent injury he is inflicting upon this delicate organ.

Rooms should be well and evenly lighted. The irregular and flickering light of common lamps
and candles is very injurious, and should be avoided in the study, and in all mechanical pursuits
where the eye is much taxed. The best oculists concur in the opinion that reflected and concentrated
light are highly injurious. Several cases of actual blindness are recorded as having occurred
within a few years from exposure to concentrated light, and weakness of sight that has unfitted
the individual for usefulness through life has often been thus produced. The rays of the sun
are considered as peculiarly injurious when reflected from an opposite building or wall, or
even when they pass through a window, and, descending to the floor, are thence reflected to
the eyes. What, then, shall we say of the habit of constructing school-rooms in such a manner
that perhaps a majority of the scholars are obliged to write and study at desks upon which
the direct rays of the sun shine for a considerable portion of the day unbroken unless it be
by a passing cloud! And yet thousands of school-houses are situated in such a manner as to
create this very necessity all over our country. At a moderate estimate, the eyes of one hundred
thousand children are taxed in this manner in the schools of the United States every passing
year. A vast amount of discomfort and unhappiness is produced in this way that might easily
be avoided, would parents and teachers take the trouble. Any exposure of this kind should be
immediately obviated, either by blinds, or by curtains of some soft color. A few newspapers
are much better than nothing. The desks and furniture should be of such a color that the eye
may repose upon them with agreeable sensations. Nature is clothed with drapery whose color
is refreshing to the eye; and it is false taste, as well as false philosophy, which attempts
to dazzle in order to please it.

The use of side lights is injurious. The eye will accommodate itself to light of different
degrees of intensity within a limited range, but both eyes should be exposed to an equal degree
of light. The sympathy between the eyes is so great, that if the pupil of one eye is dilated
by being kept in the shade, as must, of course, be the case where the light is on one side,
the eye which is exposed can not contract itself sufficiently for protection, and is almost
inevitably injured.

When viewing objects, we should avoid, as far as possible, all oblique positions of the eye.
By neglecting this rule, an unnatural and permanent contraction of the muscle is liable to
be produced, as is illustrated in the numerous instances of strabismus, or cross-eye, which
are every where too common.

We should accustom the eye to viewing objects at different distances. The muscles upon which
the form of the eye and the size of the pupil depend are subject to the general laws of muscular
action. Their strength and flexibility, which are increased by healthful exercise, are impaired
by disuse. Hence students who have neglected this rule, and have accustomed themselves for
a long time to view objects near by, lose the power of adjusting the eye so as to view things
at a distance. As a consequence, they become near-sighted, and put on glasses, when, by a proper
use of the eye, their vision might have been preserved unimpaired many long years. I know some
students upon whom this habit became so firmly fixed before they were twenty years of age,
that they felt compelled to put on glasses, but who, unwilling to contract so pernicious a
habit in early life, commenced a course of discipline in accordance with the suggestions here
given. By perseverance, their eyes not only recovered their former healthful action, but became
so improved that they now possess the sense of vision unimpaired not only, but in a very high
state of cultivation.

Persons become near or long sighted as the objects to which they are accustomed to direct the
eye are near or remote. This is illustrated in the case of students, watch-makers, and engravers,
who are accustomed to examine minute objects near the eye, and, as a consequence, become near-sighted;
and of surveyors, hunters, and sailors, who, being accustomed to view objects at a distance,
become long-sighted. By a proper discipline of the eye, persons may attain and retain the power
of viewing objects near by and at a distance, as is illustrated in the case of those gunsmiths
who are accustomed to manufacture guns, and to try them in shooting at a mark at a great distance.
The preceding principles being borne in mind in their various applications. I need, perhaps,
state but one more rule.

He who would secure clear and distinct vision, must observe all those rules which are necessary
to keep the body in health. The sympathy of the eyes with all the other organs of the body
is wonderful and intimate. There is no other organ whose strength depends so much on the general
vigor of the system. Strict temperance in eating and drinking may be regarded as an indispensable
requisite for the preservation of healthy eyes. To this may be attributed the clear heads of
the ancient philosophers, who, unlike most students of the present day, exercised their bodies
and limbs as well as their minds. Their works are not the production of congested brains, for
these were not oppressed with blood belonging to other parts of the body. They studied and
thought, and exercised both body and mind in the open air, and thus observed the laws of health.
But among the multitudes of close students of the present day, who complain of weakness of
the eyes, the misfortune is generally attributable to an almost total neglect of the first
principles of health.

While we reproach and loathe the man whose eyes are red and weeping with the effects of intemperate
drinking, we cordially pity purblind students, as in some sense martyrs to the cause of learning.
Dr. Reynolds, a distinguished American oculist, administers a rebuke to such which we fear
is too often merited: "A closer examination of their history presents a very different result.
Our sympathy may grow cool if we regard them with a physiologic eye. It is a love of the flesh,
more than a love of the spirit, that too often clouds their vision. It is too much food, crowding
with unnecessary blood the tender vessels of the retina. It is too little exercise, allowing
these accumulated fluids to settle down into fatal congestion. It is positions wholly at variance
with the freedom of the circulation, and various other imprudences, which are the results of
carelessness or unjustifiable ignorance. 'The day laborer may eat what he will, provided it
is wholesome, and his eyes will not suffer. But let the student, who is called upon to devote
not only his eyes, but his brain, to severe labor, live upon highly nutritious food, and such
as is difficult of digestion, and we shall soon see how his vision will be impaired, through
the vehement and persevering determination of blood to the head, which such a course must inevitably
occasion.' So speaks Beer, whose extensive opportunities of observation have perhaps never
been exceeded. The daily practice of every observing oculist is filled with coincident experience."

Among the prevalent habits of students by which the eyes are injured, the same writer mentions
the irritation produced by rubbing them on awaking in the morning, a practice which has in
some cases occasioned permanent and incurable disease; reading while the body is in a recumbent
position; using the eyes too early after the system has been affected with serious disease;
exercising them too much in the examination of minute objects; the popular plan of using green
spectacles, and the use of tobacco.

Light which is sufficient for distinct vision, and which falls over the shoulder in an oblique
direction, from above, upon the book or study table, is generally regarded, and with great
propriety, as best suited to the eyes. Some oculists prefer to have the light fall over the
left shoulder.

The acuteness of this sense and the extent of its cultivation are very much greater in some
individuals and classes of men than in others. This is a fact that has been remarked by observing
persons. Its consequences should not be overlooked, for they are neither few nor unimportant.
Those persons who have been long accustomed, either by the necessity of their situation, the
example of those about them, or the judicious care of parents and teachers, to observe attentively
the relations of parts, the symmetry of forms, or the shades of color, have eyes that are perpetually
soliciting their minds to notice some beautiful or grand perceptions. Wherever they turn, they
espy some new, and, therefore, curious arrangement of the elements of shape, some striking
combination of light and shade, or some delicious peculiarity of coloring. The multiplicity
and variety of their perceptions must and do increase the number of their thoughts, or give
to their thoughts greater compass and definiteness. Such persons are likely to become poets,
or painters, or sculptors, or architects. At any rate, they will appreciate and enjoy the productions
of others who have devoted themselves to these delightful arts. And will not such persons be
most readily awakened to descry and adore the power, the skill, and the beneficence of the
Great Architect who reared the stupendous fabric of the universe, who devised the infinite
variety of forms which diversify creation, and whose pencil has so profusely decked every work
with myriads of mingling dyes, resulting all from a few parent colors? To an unpracticed eye,
the beauties and wonders of creation are all lost. The surface of the earth is a blank, or,
at best, but a confused and misty page. Such an eye passes over this scene of things, and makes
no communication to the mind that will awaken thought, much less enkindle the spirit of devout
adoration, and fill the soul with love to Him "whose universal love smiles every where."

Mr. May speaks no less sensibly than eloquently when he says, "I may be extravagant in my estimation
of the importance of the culture of the eye and the ear, but so it is, that while I have been
reading the writings of the Hebrew Prophets, and of those other gifted bards who communed so
intently with nature and with nature's God, it has seemed to me impossible that any one could
enter fully into all the tenderness, beauty, and sublimity of their language, or receive into
his heart all its peculiarity of meaning, unless his own eye had been used to trace the skill
of that hand which framed and fashioned every thing that is, and to descry the delicacy of
that pencil which has painted all the flowers of the field, nor unless his own ear has learned
to perceive the melody and harmony of sounds."

We can discipline the sight directly, and to a very great extent; and we can have the satisfaction
of perceiving the progressive improvement of the faculty. For this purpose, every school should
be furnished with appropriate apparatus. A set of measures is indispensable. I will illustrate
by an example. For the benefit of the primary department connected with a seminary of learning
that was formerly for several years under my supervision, I constructed a set of rules for
linear measurement. Their breadth and thickness were uniform, each being an inch wide and half
an inch thick. The set consisted of nine rules, whose lengths were as follows: four were each
one foot long; one, a foot and a half long; two, two feet; one, two and a half feet; and one,
three feet. Every rule had a small hole bored through each end. I had also a number of small
pins turned just the right size to fit these holes. I have since submitted to several hundred
teachers, in institutes and elsewhere, my mode of combining and using these measures; and from
the deep interest which a large number of intelligent parents and teachers in different localities
have manifested in the subject, I venture to refer to it in this connection. I first tried
the experiment ten years ago, with a class of about twenty children from four to seven years
of age. Several of these could not read, and some of them had not learned the alphabet. The
children were first led to observe carefully the length of these several rules, until they
could determine at sight the length of each. For several of the first lessons some of them
would misjudge. They would, for instance, call a two foot rule one and a half or two and a
half feet long. In such cases their judgments were immediately corrected by the application
of two one foot rules. They were then led to observe with care, tables, desks, etc., and to
estimate their length, and were afterward permitted to measure them, and discover the degree
of accuracy in their decisions. After obtaining the opinions of the children in relation to
the length or height of an object, I would measure it myself in the presence of the class.
When the class became a little experienced, we examined the length, breadth, and height of
rooms, of houses, and of churches; and then the distance of objects less or more remote, correcting
or confirming their estimates by the application of the rule or measure, which gave a permanent
interest to the exercise. By exercising the class in this manner, not to exceed half an hour
a day, they would, at the end of the first quarter, judge of each other's height, of the height
of persons generally, of the length of various objects, of the size of buildings, and of the
dimensions of yards, gardens, and fields, with greater accuracy than the average of adult persons,
as was tested by actual measurement in some instances where there was a disagreement in opinion.

By holding these rules in different positions, the children readily became familiar with the
meaning and practical application of the terms perpendicular, horizontal, and oblique. They
would also tell which term is applicable to the different parts of the stove-pipe; to the different
parts of the furniture of the school-room; to the floor, sides of the room, roof, etc.; and
to all objects with which they were familiar.

But the reader may inquire, what is the use of the holes and the pins? By pinning two rules
together, one resting upon the other, and then turning one of them around, the class will readily
gain a correct idea of the use of the term angle; also of the terms acute angle, right angle,
and obtuse angle. By pinning three of these rules together at their ends, the children not
only see, but can handle the simplest form of geometrical figures. When this figure is defined,
they are enabled permanently to possess themselves of the meaning of the word triangle, by
the simultaneous exercise of three senses. By combining rules of the same and different lengths,
they become familiar with equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right, and obtuse angled triangles.
By combining, in this way, such a set of rules as I have described, the child readily becomes
familiar with the names and many of the properties of more than half a score of geometrical
figures, with less effort on the part of the teacher than would be required to teach the child
the names of the same number of letters. These exercises, then, may well precede the learning
of the alphabet, or, at least, proceed simultaneously with it. By this means the child's interest
in the school is increased; his senses are cultivated; he is enabled better to fix his attention;
he progresses more rapidly and thoroughly in his juvenile studies, and at the same time lays
the foundation for future excellence in penmanship and drawing, and other useful arts.

The child may also be taught to discriminate the varieties of green in leaves and other things;
of yellow, red, and blue, in flowers and paints; and to distinguish not only the shades of
all the colors, but their respective proportions in mixtures of two or more. Many persons,
for want of such early culture, have grown to years without the ability of distinguishing between
colors, as others have who have neglected the culture of the ear without the ability of distinguishing
between tunes.

Drawing, whether of maps, the shape of objects, or of landscapes, is admirably adapted to discipline
the sight. Children should be encouraged carefully to survey and accurately to describe the
prominent points of a landscape, both in nature and in picture. Let them point out the elevations
and depressions; the mowing, the pasture, the wood, and the tillage land; the trees, the houses,
and the streams. Listen to their accounts of their plays, walks, and journeys, and of any events
of which they have been witnesses. In these and all other exercises of the sight, children
should be encouraged to be strictly accurate; and whenever it is practicable, the judgment
they pronounce and the descriptions they give should, if erroneous, be corrected by the truth.
Children can not fail to be interested in such exercises; and even where they have been careless
and inaccurate observers, they will soon become more watchful and exact.

It is by the benign influences of education only that the senses can be improved. And still
their culture has been entirely neglected by perhaps the majority of parents and teachers,
who in other respects have manifested a commendable degree of interest in this subject. That
by judicious culture the senses may be educated to activity and accuracy, and be made to send
larger and purer streams of knowledge to the soul, has been unanswerably proved by an accumulation
of unquestionable testimony. Most persons, however, allow the senses to remain uneducated,
except as they may be cultivated by fortuitous circumstances. Eyes have they, but they see
not; ears have they, but they hear not; neither do they understand. It is not impossible, nor
perhaps improbable, that he who has these two senses properly cultivated will derive more unalloyed
pleasure in spending a brief hour in gazing upon a beautiful landscape, in examining for the
same length of time a simple flower, or in listening to the sweet melody of the linnet as it
warbles its song of praise, than those who have neglected the cultivation of the senses experience
during their whole lives!

This subject commends itself to all who regard their individual happiness, or who desire to
render their usefulness as extensive as possible. Upon parents, teachers, and clergymen, who
are more immediately concerned in the correct education of the rising generation, its claims
are imperative. Let them be met, in connection with other appropriate means now in use and
hereafter to be put in requisition, and our schools can not fail to become increasingly attractive;
truancy, hence, will be less frequent, and the benign influences resulting from the correct
education of the whole man will inspire the benevolent and philanthropic to renewed and increased
efforts to secure the right education of all men, a condition upon which the maximum of human
happiness depends.

CHAPTER VII.

THE NECESSITY OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.

    The exaltation of talent, as it is called, above virtue and
    religion, is the curse of the age. Education is now chiefly a
    stimulus to learning, and thus men acquire power without the
    principles which alone make it a good. Talent is worshiped; but if
    divorced from rectitude, it will prove more of a demon than a
    god.--CHANNING.

    Religion ought to be the basis of education, according to
    often-repeated writings and declamations. The assertion is true.
    Christianity furnishes the true basis for raising up character; but
    the foundation must be laid in a very different manner from that
    which is commonly practiced. * * * We can, indeed, scarcely conceive
    of the purity, the self-denial, and the power that might be given to
    human character by systematic development.--LALOR.

We have now reached a department of our subject of surpassing importance, for however judiciously
physical and intellectual cultivation may have been conducted, if we make a mistake here, all
is lost. Knowledge is power, it is true; but we should bear in mind that it is potent for evil
as well as for good; and that, whether its effects be good or ill, depends entirely upon the
dispositions and sentiments by which it is impelled and guided. Numerous have been the instances
illustrative of the fact that the greatest scourges of our race are men of gigantic cultivated
intellect. Where knowledge but qualifies its possessor for inflicting misery, ignorance would
indeed be bliss.

I find my views on this important subject so admirably expressed in the writings of some of
the most eminent men of the age, that I feel it both a privilege and a duty to enforce the
sentiments I would inculcate by the introduction of their testimony.

Dr. Humphrey observes,[25] that "it must strike every one who is capable of taking a just and
comprehensive view of the subject, that the common idea of a good education--of such an education
as every child in the state ought to receive--is exceedingly narrow and defective. Most men
leave out, or regard as of very little importance, some of the essential elements. They seem
to forget that the child has a conscience and a heart to be educated as well as an intellect.
If they do not lay too much stress on mental culture, which, indeed, is hardly possible, they
lay by far too little upon that which is moral and religious. They expect to elevate the child
to his proper station in society, to make him wise and happy, an honest man, a virtuous citizen,
and a good patriot, by furnishing him with a comfortable school-house, suitable class-books,
competent teachers, and, if he is poor, paying his quarter bills, while they greatly underrate,
if they do not entirely overlook, that high moral training, without which knowledge is the
power of doing evil rather than good. It may possibly nurture up a race of intellectual giants,
but, like the sons of Anak, they will be far readier to trample down the Lord's heritage than
to protect and cultivate it.

  [25] In a lecture before the American Institute of Instruction, on the
  Moral and Religious Training of Children.

"Education is not a talismanic word, but an art, or rather a science; and, I may add, the most
important of all sciences. It is the right, the proper training of the whole man, the thorough
and symmetrical cultivation of all his noble faculties. If he were endowed with a mere physical
nature, he would need, he would receive none but a physical training. On the other hand, if
he were a purely intellectual being, intellectual culture would comprehend all that could be
included in a perfect education. And were it possible for a moral being to exist without either
body or intellect, there would be nothing but the heart or affections to educate. But man is
a complex, and not a simple being. He is neither all body, nor all mind, nor all heart. In
popular language, he has three natures, a corporeal, a rational, and a moral. These three,
mysteriously united, are essential to constitute a perfect man; and as they all begin to expand
in very early childhood, the province of education is to watch, and assist, and shape the development;
to train, and strengthen, and discipline neither of them alone, but each according to its intrinsic
and relative importance.

"When it is said that 'man is a religious being,' we should carefully inquire in what respects
he is so. In a guarded and limited sense the proposition is undoubtedly true. Terrible as was
the shock which his moral nature received by 'the fall,' it was not wholly buried in the ruins.
Though blackened and crushed to the effacing of that glorious image in which he was created,
his moral susceptibilities were not destroyed. The capacity of being restored, and of infinite
improvement in knowledge and virtue, was left. In the lowest depths of ignorance and debasement,
the human soul feels that it must have some religion, some support, some refuge 'when flesh
and heart fail.' There is a natural dread of annihilation, a longing after immortality, a starting
back from the last leap in the dark. Men, if they have not true religion, will cling to the
greatest absurdities as substitutes. Hence the pagan world is full of idols. Tribes and nations
seemingly destitute of all moral sense, nevertheless have 'gods many and lords many.' If there
are any cold-blooded, incorrigible atheists in the world, you must look for them not in heathen
lands. You must go where the altars of the true God have been thrown down. In this view, man
is a religious being. He has a moral nature. He is susceptible of deep and controlling religious
impressions. He can, at a very early period of life, be made to see and feel the difference
between right and wrong--between good and evil. He can, while yet a child, be influenced by
hope and by fear--by reason, by persuasion, and by the word of God; and all this shows that
religion was intended to be a prominent part of his education. There can be no mistake in this.
It is plainly the will of God that the moral as well as the intellectual faculties should be
cultivated. Every child, whether in the family or the school, is to be treated by those who
have the care of him as a moral and accountable being. His religious susceptibilities invite
to the most diligent culture, and virtually enjoin it upon every teacher. The simple study
of man's moral nature, before we open the Bible, unavoidably leads to the conclusion that any
system of popular education must be extremely defective which does not make special prevision
for this branch of public instruction.

"Even if there had been no fatal lapse of our race--if our children were not naturally depraved,
nor inclined to evil in the slightest degree, still they would need religious as well as physical
and intellectual guidance and discipline. It is true, the educator's task would be infinitely
easier and pleasanter than it now is, but they would need instruction. They would enter the
world just as ignorant of their immortal destiny as of letters. They would have every thing
to learn about the being and perfections of God; every thing about his rightful claims as their
Creator, Preserver, and moral Governor; and every thing touching their duties and relations
to their fellow-men. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that moral and religious training
would be necessary to strengthen the principle of virtue in the rising generation, and confirm
them in habits of obedience and benevolence. As, notwithstanding their bodies are perfect bodies,
and their minds perfect minds at their creation, no member or faculty being wanting, still
they need all the helps of education; so, if they had a perfectly upright moral nature, they
would need the same helps. There is no more reason to think, had sin never entered into the
world, every child would have grown up to the 'fullness of the stature of a perfect man' in
a religious sense, without an appropriate education, than that he would have become a scholar
without it. But the little beings that are all the while springing into life around us to be
educated are the sinful offspring of apostate parents. How deeply depraved, how strongly inclined
to sin from the cradle, this is not the place to inquire. All agree that they show an early
bias in the wrong direction; and that, left to grow up without moral culture and restraint,
the great majority would go far astray, and become bad members of society. This is sufficient
for our present argument. The evil bias must be counteracted. For the safety of the state,
as well as for their own sakes, all its children must be brought under the forming and sanative
influence of religious education. No adequate substitute was ever devised, or ever can be.
'Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.'
This is divine; and the opposite is equally true. Train up a child in the way he should not
go, or--which comes to about the same thing--leave him to take the wrong way of his own accord,
and when he is old he will not depart from that. His tread will be heavier and heavier upon
the broad and beaten track. But few parents, however, have the leisure and ability to do all
that is demanded in this vitally essential branch of education. All are entitled to the aid
of their pastors and religious teachers; and every good shepherd will feel a tender concern
for the lambs of his flock, and will feed them with the sincere milk of the word both in the
sanctuary and at the fireside. But the work should not stop here. There ought to be a co-operation
of good influences in all the seminaries of learning, and especially in the primary schools.
This co-operation would be necessary if moral and religious household instruction were universally
given, and if all the children of the state regularly attended public worship, and enjoyed
the benefits of catechetical and Sabbath-school teaching. But those who would banish religion
from our admirable systems of popular education by the plea that it belongs exclusively to
the family and the Church, ought to remember what multitudes of children this exclusion would
deprive of their birth-right as members of a Christian community. There are tens of thousands
in our own heaven-blessed New England, and hundreds of thousands in these United States, who
receive no religious instruction whatever at home, and whose parents are connected with no
religious denomination. What is to be done? We can neither compel ignorant and graceless fathers
and mothers to teach their children the fear of the Lord, nor to send them to any place of
worship or Sabbath-school. I ask again, what is to be done? These neglected children are in
the midst of us. Our cities swarm with them. They are scattered every where over our beautiful
hills and valleys. Grow up they will among our own children, without principle and without
morals, to breathe mildew upon the young virtues which we have sown in our families, and to
prey upon the dearest interests of society, unless somebody cares for their moral and religious
education. And where shall they receive this education, if not in the school-house? You will
find them there, if in any place of instruction, and multitudes of them you can reach nowhere else.

"A more Utopian dream never visited the brain of a sensible man than that which promises to
usher in a new golden age by the diffusion and thoroughness of what is commonly understood
by popular education. With all its funds, and improved school-houses, and able teachers, and
grammars, and maps, and black-boards, such an education is essentially defective. Without moral
principle at bottom to guide and control its energies, education is a sharp sword in the hands
of a practiced and reckless fencer. I have no hesitation in saying, that if we could have but
one, moral and religious culture is even more important than a knowledge of letters; and that
the former can not be excluded from any system of popular education without infinite hazard.
Happily, the two are so far from being hostile powers in the common domain, that they are natural
allies, moving on harmoniously in the same right line, and mutually strengthening each other.
The more virtue you can infuse into the hearts of your pupils, the better they will improve
their time, and the more rapid will be their proficiency in their common studies. The most
successful teachers have found the half hour devoted to moral and religious instruction more
profitable to the scholar than any other half hour in the day; and there are no teachers who
govern their schools with so much ease as this class. Though punishment is sometimes necessary
where moral influence has done its utmost, the conscience is, in all ordinary cases, an infinitely
better disciplinarian than the rod. When you can get a school to obey and to study because
it is right, and from a conviction of accountability to God, you have gained a victory which
is worth more than all the penal statutes in the world; but you can never gain such a victory
without laying great stress upon religious principle in your daily instructions.

"There is, I am aware, in the minds of some warm and respectable friends of popular education,
an objection against incorporating religious instruction into the system as one of its essential
elements. It can not, they think, be done without bringing in along with it the evils of sectarianism.
If this objection could not be obviated, it would, I confess, have great weight in my own mind.
It supposes that if any religious instruction is given, the distinctive tenets of some particular
denomination must be inculcated. But is this at all necessary? Must we either exclude religion
altogether from our common schools, or teach some one of the many creeds which are embraced
by as many different sects in the ecclesiastical calendar? Surely not. There are certain great
moral and religious principles in which all denominations are agreed; such as the ten commandments,
our Savior's golden rule--every thing, in short, which lies within the whole range of duty
to God and duty to our fellow-men. I should be glad to know what sectarianism there can be
in a schoolmaster's teaching my children the first and second tables of the moral law; to 'love
the Lord their God with all their heart, and their neighbor as themselves;' in teaching them
to keep the Sabbath holy, to honor their parents, not to swear, nor drink, nor lie, nor cheat,
nor steal, nor covet. Verily, if this is what any mean by sectarianism, then the more we have
of it in our common schools the better. 'It is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation,'
that there is so little of it. I have not the least hesitation in saying, that no instructor,
whether male or female, ought ever to be employed who is not both able and willing to teach
morality and religion in the manner which I have just alluded to. Were this faithfully done
in all the primary schools of the nation, our civil and religious liberties, and all our blessed
institutions, would be incomparably safer than they are now. The parent who says, I do not
send my child to school to learn religion, but to be taught reading, and writing, and grammar,
knows not 'what manner of spirit he is of.' It is very certain, that such a father will teach
his children any thing but religion at home; and is it right that they should be left to grow
up as heathens in a Christian land? If he says to the schoolmaster, I do not wish you to make
my son an Episcopalian, a Baptist, a Presbyterian, or a Methodist, very well. That is not the
schoolmaster's business. He was not hired to teach sectarianism. But if the parent means to
say, I do not send my child to school to have you teach him to fear God and keep his commandments,
to be temperate, honest, and true, to be a good son and a good man, then the child is to be
pitied for having such a father; and with good reason might we tremble for all that we hold
most dear, if such remonstrances were to be multiplied and to prevail.

"In this connection I can not refrain from earnestly recommending the daily reading of the
Scriptures, and prayer,[26] in all our schools, as eminently calculated to exert a powerful
moral influence upon the scholars. It is melancholy to think what swarms of children are growing
up even in Massachusetts--and what multitudes of them in every one of these United States--who
will seldom, if ever, hear the voice of prayer if they do not hear it in the schools, and to
whom the Bible will remain a sealed book if it be not opened there. I would not insist that
every primary teacher should be absolutely required to open or close the school daily with
prayer. Great and good as I think the influence of such an arrangement would be, it might be
impossible, at present, to find a sufficient number of instructors otherwise well qualified
who are fitted to lead in this exercise. The number, however, I believe is steadily increasing.
It is probably too late for me, but I hope that some of you, gentlemen, may live to see the
time when the voice of prayer, and of praise too, will be heard in every school-house of the
land. Could I know that this would be the case, it would give me a confidence in the perpetuity
of our civil and religious liberties which I should exceedingly rejoice to cherish as I pass
off from the stage."

  [26] I would not be understood to recommend that any person who does not
  love the Bible, and the doctrines which it inculcates, and who does not
  seek after that purity of heart which it every where enjoins, should
  conduct devotional exercises in school; but I would respectfully inquire
  whether any who do not delight in such exercises, and who do not
  esteem it a privilege to lead the devotions of those under their
  charge, do not lack an essential qualification to teach school. Our
  laws generally require that the school-teacher be, among other things,
  well qualified in respect to moral character TO INSTRUCT a Primary
  School.

It would seem that these patriotic sentiments, enforced by such persuasive eloquence by this
venerable man, can hardly fail to find a permanent lodgment in every truly American bosom.
The great principles of natural and revealed religion, in which all are agreed, ought to be
inculcated in our common school-books,[27] just as every teacher ought orally to instill these
principles into the minds of his pupils. That will be a happy day, especially to the children
of ignorant and vicious parents, when they shall learn more of that "fear of the Lord which
is the beginning of knowledge" in the school-house than they have ever yet done. Nor is it
discovered that the practice of teaching morals according to the Christian code, and using
the Bible for that purpose, the great majority adopting it, is any infringement whatever on
the religious rights and liberty of any individual.

  [27] The day of writing the above, a lady mentioned to me the following
  gratifying illustration of my idea. The subject of it is a little girl
  only five years of age, who has never attended school, but has learned
  to read at home, under her mother's tuition. After reading in the first
  number of one of our excellent series of reading books, the story of
  "the honest boy" who never told a lie, for perhaps the twentieth time,
  the little girl said to her mother, "Mother, I like to read this story,
  for it always makes me feel very happy." Similar instances I have
  witnessed scores of times, in the family and in the school. Teachers may
  almost invariably lead their scholars to admire and copy the examples of
  good children about whom they read, and to dislike and avoid those of
  bad ones. This power over children should always be exercised for good.

The anecdote of the Indian touching this subject may arrest the attention of some reader who
would otherwise peruse these paragraphs without profit, and fix indelibly in his mind the sentiment
I would inculcate, and I therefore insert it. The Indian inquires of the white man what religion
he professes. The white man replies, "Not any." "Not any?" says the Indian, in astonishment;
"then you are just like my dog; he's got no religion." We have men enough like the Indian's
dog, without teaching our children to be like him.

The French, in the days of the Revolution, voted God from his throne. They abolished the Sabbath,
and declared that Christianity was a nullity. They set apart one day in ten, not for religion,
but for idleness and licentiousness. History informs us that the goddess of Reason, personified
by a naked prostitute, was drawn in triumph through the streets of Paris, and that the municipal
officers of the city, and the members of the National Convention of France, joined publicly
in the impious parade. We need not wonder, then, that even the forms of religion were destroyed,
and that licentiousness and profligacy walked forth unveiled. How unlike this is the state
of things in these United States! We are professedly a Christian nation. We recognize the existence
of a superior and superintending power in all our institutions.

The New World was early sought by a Christian people, that fled from oppression in order to
find a home where they might worship God unmolested, and bequeath to posterity the same inestimable
privilege and inalienable right. In the days of the Revolution, Washington and his coadjutors
were accustomed to invoke the blessing of the God of battles; and without His favor, they looked
not for victory. In the Congress of this Great Nation, and in our State Legislatures, we are
accustomed to acknowledge our dependence upon God in employing chaplains with whom we unite
in daily devotions. The Constitution of each of the several states requires a similar oath
or affirmation; and some of them further provide that, in addition to the oath of office, all
persons appointed to places of profit or trust shall, before entering upon the same, subscribe
a declaration of their faith in the Christian religion.

In our Penitentiaries even, we employ chaplains for the social, moral, and religious improvement
of criminals confined within them; for our object is, not merely to deter others from vice
by the punishment of offenders, but, if possible, to reform the offenders themselves, and,
bringing them back to virtue, make them useful members both of Christian and of civil society.
Should we not, then, recognize God in our common schools--the primary training-places of our
country's youth--by reading His word, and familiarizing the juvenile mind of the nation with
the precepts of the Great Teacher, whose code of morals is acknowledged, even by infidels,
to be infinitely superior to any of human origin? And should we not humbly invoke His aid in
our efforts to learn and to do his will? and His blessing to attend those efforts? A Paul may
plant, and Apollos water; but God giveth the increase.

The instruction in our common schools, I repeat, should be Christian, but not sectarian. There
is sufficient common ground which all true believers in Christianity agree in, to effect an
incalculable amount of good, if honestly and faithfully taught. Which of the various religious
sects in our country would take exceptions to the inculcation of the following sentiments,
and kindred ones expressed in every part of the Scriptures? "As ye would that men should do
to you, do ye also to them likewise."

If there is a single instance in which a sect of professing Christians would take exceptions
to the inculcation of these and kindred sentiments in all the schools of our land, I have yet
to learn it. On the contrary, I have received and accepted invitations from scores of clergymen,
representing not less than eight different denominations, to address their congregations on
the subject of "Moral and Religious Education in Common Schools;" and, having expressed the
sentiments herein advocated, I have, in every instance, received letters of approval and encouragement;
and their hearty prayers and active co-operation have confirmed me in the belief that they
are ready and willing to "work together" upon this common platform, in advancing the interests
of this glorious cause.

I have spoken of the Christian religion as the most important branch of a common school education.
The cultivation of the intellectual faculties alone constitutes no sufficient guaranty that
the subject of it will become either a virtuous man, a good neighbor, or a useful citizen.

"The Bible, in several expressive texts," says Dr. Stowe,[28] "gives emphatic utterance to
the true principle of all right education. For example, 'The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom, and a knowledge of the Holy is understanding.' Religion must be the basis of all
right education; and an education without religion is an education for perdition. Religion,
in its most general sense, is the union of the soul to its Creator; a union of sympathy, originating
in affection, and guided by intelligence. The word is derived from the Latin terms re and ligo,
and signifies to tie again, or reunite. The soul, sundered from God by sin, by grace is reunited
to Him; and this is religion."

  [28] In a lecture before the American Institute of Instruction, on the
  Religious Element in Education.

I might present many and substantial reasons why instruction in the principles of religion
should be given in our common schools and in all our institutions of learning, and why those
heaven-given principles should be exemplified wherever taught.

The nature of the human mind requires it, as is clearly shown by the writer last quoted. "The
mind is created, and God is its creator. Every mind is conscious to itself that it is not self-existent
or independent, but that its existence is a derived one, and its condition one of entire, uniform,
unceasing dependence. This feeling is as truly a part of the essential constitution of the
mind as the desire for food is of the body, and it never can be totally suppressed. If it ever
seems to be annihilated, it is only for a very brief interval; and any man who would persist
in affirming himself to be self-existent and independent, would be universally regarded as
insane. The sympathy which attracts the sexes toward each other is not more universal nor generally
stronger than that inward want which makes the whole human race feel the need of God; and,
indeed, the feelings are, in many respects, so analogous to each other, that all ancient mysteries
of mythology, and the Bible itself, have selected this sympathy as the most expressive, the
most unvarying symbol of the relation between the soul and God.

"Till men can be taught to live and be healthy and strong without food; till some way is discovered
in which the social state can be perpetuated and made happy, with a total separation of the
sexes; till the time arrives when these things can be done, we can not expect to relieve the
human mind from having some kind of religious faith. This being the fact, a system of education
which excludes attention from this part of the mental constitution is as essentially incomplete
as a system of military tactics that has no reference to fighting battles; a system of mechanics
which teaches nothing respecting machinery; a system of agriculture that has nothing to do
with planting and harvesting; a system of astronomy which never alludes to the stars; a system
of politics which gives no intimation on government; or any thing else which professes to be
a system, and leaves out the very element most essential to its existence. The history of all
ages, of all nations, and of all communities is a continued illustration of this truth. Where
did the nation ever exist untouched either by religion or superstition? which never had either
a theology or a mythology? When you find a nation that exists without food of some sort, then
you may find a nation that subsists without religion of some sort; and never, never before.
How unphilosophical, how absurd it is, then, to pretend that a system of education may be complete,
and yet make no provision for this part of the mental constitution! It is one of the grossest
fooleries which the wickedness of man has ever led him to commit. But it is not only unphilosophical
and foolish, it is also exceedingly mischievous; for where religion is withheld, the mind inevitably
falls to superstition, as certainly as when wholesome food is withheld the sufferer will seek
to satisfy his cravings with the first deleterious substance which comes within his reach.
The only remedy against superstition is sound religious instruction. The want exists in the
soul. It is no factitious, no accidental or temporary want, but an essential part of our nature.
It is an urgent, imperious want; it must and will seek the means of satisfaction, and if a
healthful supply be withheld, a noxious one will be substituted."

THE BIBLE IN SCHOOLS.--Having taken the liberty of recommending the devotional reading of the
Scriptures in all the public schools as eminently calculated to make them what they ought to
be--nurseries of morality and religion as well as of good learning--I am now prepared to express
the strong conviction, to adopt the language of Dr. Humphrey, "that the Bible ought to be used
in every primary school as a class-book. I am not ignorant of the objections which even some
good men are wont to urge against its introduction. The Bible, it is said, is too sacred a
volume to be put on a level with common school-books, and to be thumbed over and thrown about
by dirty hands. This objection supposes that if the Bible is made a school-book, it must needs
be put into such rude hands; and that it can not be daily read in the classes without diminishing
the reverence with which it ought to be regarded as the book of God. But I would have it used
chiefly by the older scholars, who, if the teachers are not in the fault, will rarely deface
it. A few words now and then, reminding them of its sacred contents, will be sufficient to
protect it from rough and vulgar usage.

"The objection that making the Bible a common school-book would detract from its sacredness
in the eyes of the children, and thus blunt rather than quicken their moral susceptibilities,
is plausible; but it will not, I am confident, bear the test of examination and experience.
What were the Scriptures given us for, if not to be read by the old and the young, the high
and the low? Is the common use of any good thing which a kind Providence intended for all,
calculated to make men underrate it? The best of Heaven's gifts, it is true, are liable to
be perverted and abused; but ought this to deter us from using them thankfully and properly?
We, the descendants of the Puritans, are so far from regarding the Bible as too sacred for
common use, that, however we may differ among ourselves in other respects, we cordially unite
in efforts to put the sacred treasure in the hands of all the people. It is one of our cardinal
principles, as Protestants, that the more they read the Scriptures the better. Are we right
or are we wrong here? Let us bring the question to the test of experience. Who are the most
moral and well-principled class in the community? those who have been accustomed from childhood
to read the Bible, till it has become the most familiar of all books, or those who read it
but little? Of two schools, of equal advantages in other respects, which is best regulated
and most easily governed? which has most of the fear of God in it, the deepest reverence for
his word, that where the Bible is read or from which it is excluded? It is easy for ingenious
men to reason plausibly, and tell us that such and such injurious effects must follow from
making sacred things too familiar to the youthful mind; but who ever heard of such effects
following from the use of the Bible as a school-book? It will be time enough to listen to this
objection when a solitary example can be adduced to sustain it.

"How do all other men out of the Protestant communion, Papists, Mohammedans, Jews, and Gentiles,
reason and act in the education of their children? Do they discard their sacred books from
the schools as too holy for common and familiar use? No. They understand the influence of such
reading far too well, and are too strongly attached to their respective religions to exclude
it. The Romanists, indeed, forbid the use of the Scriptures to the common people; but the Missal
and the Breviary, which they hold to be quite as sacred, are their most familiar school-books.
A large portion of the children's time is taken up with reading the lessons and reciting the
prayers; and what are the effects? Do they become disgusted with the Missal and Breviary by
this daily familiarity? We all know the contrary. The very opposite effect is produced. It
is astonishing to see with what tenacity children thus educated cling to the superstitions
and absurdities of their fathers; and it is because their religion is wrought into the very
texture of their minds, in the schools as well as in the churches. Go to Turkey, to Persia,
to all the lands scorched and blighted by the fiery train of the Crescent, and what school-books
will you find but portions of the Koran? Pass to Hindostan, and there you will find the Vedas
and Shasters wherever any thing like popular education is attempted. Enter the great empire
of China, and, according to the best information we can obtain, their sacred books are the
school-books of that vast and teeming population. Inquire among the Jews, wherever in their
various dispersions they have established schools, and what will you find but the Law and the
Prophets, the Targums and the Talmud.

"Now when and where did ever Protestant children grow up with a greater reverence for the Bible,
a stronger attachment to their religion, than Jewish, Mohammedan, and Pagan children cherish
for their school-books, to the study of which they are almost exclusively confined, in every
stage of their education? It is opposing theory, then, to great and undeniable facts, to say
that using the Christian Scriptures in this manner would detract from their sacredness in the
eyes of our children. If this is ever the case, it must be where the teacher himself is a Gallio,
and lacks those moral qualifications which are essential to his profession. Another objection
which is sometimes brought against the use of the Bible is, that considerable portions of it--though
all true, and important as a part of our great religious charter--are not suitable for common
and promiscuous reading. My answer is, we do not suppose that any instructor would take all
his classes through the whole Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. The genealogical tables, and
some other things, he would omit of course, but would always find lessons enough to which the
most fastidious could make no objection.

"The way is now prepared to take an affirmative attitude, and offer some reasons in favor of
using the Bible as a school-book. In the first place, it is the cheapest school-book in the
world. It furnishes more reading for fifty cents than can be obtained in common school-books
for two dollars. This difference of cost is, to the poor, an important consideration. With
large families on their hands, they often find it extremely difficult to meet the demands of
teachers and committees for new books. Were the Scriptures generally introduced, they would
take the place of many other reading-books which parents are now obliged to purchase at four-fold
expense. This would be a cogent argument on the score of economy, even if the popular school-books
of this year were sure of maintaining their ground the next. But so busy is the press in bringing
forward new claimants to public favor, that they rapidly supplant each other, and thus the
burden is greatly increased.

"In the next place, the Bible furnishes a far greater variety of the finest reading-lessons
than any other book whatever. This is a point to which my attention has been turned for many
years, and the conviction grows upon me continually. There is no book in which children a little
advanced beyond the simplest monosyllabic lessons will learn to read faster, or more readily
catch the proprieties of inflection, emphasis, and cadence, than the Bible. I would by no means
put it into the hands of a child to spell out and blunder over the chapters before he has read
any thing else. The word of God ought not to be so used by mere beginners. But it contains
lessons adapted to all classes of learners, after the first and simplest stage. Let any teacher
who has never made the trial put a young class into the first chapter of John, and he will
be surprised to find how easy the reading is, and with what pleasure and manifest improvement
they may be carried through the whole Gospel; and as few are too young to read with advantage
in the Bible, so none are too old. It is known to every body, that the very best reading lessons
in our most popular school-books for the higher classes are taken from the Scriptures. Just
open the Sacred Volume with reference to this single point, and turn over its thousand pages.
As a history, to interest, instruct, and improve the youthful mind, what other book in the
world can compare with it? Where else will you find such exquisitely finished pieces of biography?
such poetry? such genuine and lofty eloquence? such rich and varied specimens of tenderness,
pathos, beauty, and sublimity? I regret that I have not room for a few quotations. I can only
refer, in very general terms, to the history of the creation; of Joseph and the forty years'
wandering in the wilderness; to the book of Job; to the Psalms of David; to Isaiah; to the
Gospels; and to the visions of John in the Isle of Patmos.

"Now if the primary qualities of a good school-book are to teach the art of reading, and to
communicate instruction upon the most interesting and important subjects, I have no hesitation
in saying that the Bible stands pre-eminently above every other. If I were again to become
a primary instructor, or to teach the art of reading in any higher seminary than the common
school-house, I would take the Bible in preference to any twenty 'Orators' or 'English Readers'
that I have ever seen. Indeed, I would scarcely want any other. Milton and Shakspeare I would
not reject, but I would do very well without them, for they are both surpassed by Isaiah and
John. Let enlightened teachers, and members of any of the learned professions, read over aloud,
in their best manner, such portions of Scripture as they may easily select, and see if they
have ever found any thing better fitted to bring out and discipline the voice, and to express
all the emotions in which the soul of true eloquence is bodied forth. Why do the masters of
oratory, who charm great audiences with their recitations, take so many of their themes from
the Bible? The reason is obvious. They can find none so well suited to their purpose. And why
should not the common schools, in which are nurtured so many of the future orators, and rulers,
and teachers of the land, have the advantage of the best of all reading-lessons? Moreover,
since so much of the sense of Scripture depends upon the manner in which it is read, why should
not the thousands of children be taught the art in school, who will never learn it at home?
The more I study the Bible, the more does it appear to me to excel all other reading-books.
You may go on improving indefinitely, without ever making yourself a perfect scriptural reader,
just as you might, with all the help you can command, spend your whole life in the study of
any one of its great truths without exhausting it. Let it not be said that we have but few
instructors who are capable of entering into the spirit of the Sacred Volume, so as to teach
their scholars to read it with propriety. Then let more be educated. It ought to be one of
the daily exercises in our Normal Schools, and other seminaries for raising up competent teachers,
to qualify them for this branch of instruction."

I remark again, that were the Bible made a school-book throughout the commonwealth and throughout
the land, an amount of scriptural knowledge would be insensibly treasured up, which would be
of inestimable value in after life. Every observing teacher must have been surprised to find
how much the dullest scholar will learn by the ear, without seeming to pay any attention to
what others are reading or reciting. The boy that sits half the time upon his little bench
nodding or playing with his shoe-strings, will, in the course of a winter, commit whole pages
and chapters to memory from the books he hears read, when you can hardly beat any thing into
him by dint of the most diligent instruction. Indeed, I have sometimes thought that children
in our common schools learn more by the ear, without any effort, than by the study of their
own class-books; and I am quite sure this is the case with the most of the younger scholars.
Let any book be read for a series of years in the same school, and half of the children will
know most of it by heart. Wherever there are free schools--and the free school system is now
becoming extensively adopted in every part of the United States--the great mass of the children
are kept at school from four or five years of age, to nine or ten, through the year; and in
the winter season, from nine or ten to fifteen or sixteen. The average of time thus devoted
to their education is from eight to ten years. Now let the Bible be read daily as a class-book
during all this time, in every school, and how much of it will, without effort, and without
interfering in the least with other studies, be committed to memory. And who can estimate the
value of such an acquisition? What pure morality; what maxims of supreme wisdom for guidance
along the slippery paths of youth, and onward through every stage of life; what bright examples
of early piety, and of its glorious rewards, even in the present world; what sublime revelations
of the being and perfections of God; what incentives to love and serve him, and to discharge
with fidelity all the duties which we owe to our fellow-men! and all these enforced by the
highest sanctions of future accountability. Let any man tell, if he can, how much all this
store of divine knowledge, thus insensibly acquired, would be worth to the millions of children
who are growing up in these United States of America. They might not be at all sensible of
its value at the time, but how happily and safely would it contribute to shape their future
opinions and characters, both as men and as citizens.

Another cogent reason for using the Bible as a common school-book is, that it is the firmest
basis, and, indeed, the only sure basis of our free institutions, and, as such, ought to be
familiar to all the children in the state from their earliest years. While it recognizes the
existence of civil governments, and enjoins obedience to magistrates as ministers of God for
the good of the people, it regards all men as free and equal, the children of one common Father,
and entitled to the same civil and religious privileges. I do not believe that any people could
ever be enslaved who should be thoroughly and universally educated in the principles of the Bible.

It was no less truly than eloquently said by Daniel Webster, in his Bunker Hill address, that
"the American colonists brought with them from the Old World a full portion of all the riches
of the past in science and art, and in morals, religion, and literature. The Bible came with
them. And it is not to be doubted that to the free and universal use of the Bible it is to
be ascribed that in that age men were much indebted for right views of civil liberty. The Bible
is a book of faith and a book of doctrine; but it is also a book which teaches man his individual
responsibility, his own dignity, and equality with his fellow-men."

These sentiments of the great American statesman are worthy to be engraved in golden capitals
upon the monument under whose shade they were uttered! Yes, it was the free and universal use
of the Bible which made our Puritan fathers what they were; and it is because, in these degenerate
times, multitudes of children will be taught to read it nowhere else, that I am so anxious
to have it read as a school-book. One other, and the only additional reason which I shall suggest,
is that, as the Bible is infinitely the best, so it is the only decidedly religious book which
can be introduced into our popular systems of early education. So jealous are the different
sects and denominations of each other, that it would be hardly possible to write or compile
a religious school-book with which all would be satisfied. But here is a book prepared to our
hands, which we all receive as the inspired record of our faith, and as containing the purest
morality that has ever been taught in this lower world. Episcopalians can not object to it,
because they believe it teaches the doctrines and polity of their own church; and this is just
what they want. Neither Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, Universalists,
nor any other denomination, can object to it for the same reason. Every denomination believes,
so far as it differs from the rest, that the Bible is on its side, and, of course, that the
more it is read by all, the better.

For me to object to having the Bible read as a common school-book on account of any doctrine
which those who differ from me suppose it to teach, would be virtually to confess that I had
not full confidence in my own creed, and was afraid it would not bear a scriptural test. It
seems to me an infinite advantage, for which we are bound devoutly to thank the Author of all
good, that he has given us a religious book of incomparable excellence, which we may fearlessly
put into the hands of all the children in the state, with the assurance that it is able to
make them "wise unto salvation," and will certainly make them better children, better friends,
and better members of society, so far as it influences them at all. But some persons who highly
approve of daily scriptural reading in common schools are in favor of using selections rather
than the whole Bible. I should certainly prefer this, provided the selections are judiciously
made, to excluding the Scriptures altogether; but I think there are weighty and obvious reasons
why the whole Bible should be taken rather than a part. The whole is cheaper than half would
be in a separate volume; and when the whole is introduced, "without note or comment," there
can be no possible ground for sectarian jealousy.

Doctors of divinity not only, but the most eminent statesmen in the country, hold the views
here presented. The bold and noble stand taken by the Legislature of New York more than ten
years ago (1838), has revived the hopes and infused fresh courage into the minds of those who
believe that the safety and welfare of our country are essentially dependent on the prevalence
of a "religious morality and a moral religion." The representatives of this great state, whose
system of education is becoming increasingly an object of imitation in all the rest, at one
and the same session doubled the amount of the public money for the purpose of improving the
education given in the common schools--which, to the praise of that state, be it said, are
now free--and in reply to the petition of sundry persons, praying that all religious exercises
and the use of the Bible might be prohibited in the public schools, decided by a vote of one
hundred and twenty-one to ONE! that the request of the petitioners be not granted. For the
purpose of corroborating the doctrines of this volume, I will introduce a paragraph from the
report of the Hon. Daniel D. Barnard on the occasion referred to, which was sustained by the
noble, unequivocal, and almost unanimous testimony of the representatives of the most powerful
member of the American states.

"Moral instruction is quite as important to the object had in view in popular education as
intellectual instruction; it is indispensable to that object. But, to make instruction effective,
it should be given according to the best code of morals known to the country and the age; and
that code, it is universally conceded, is contained in the Bible. Hence the Bible, as containing
that code, so far from being arbitrarily excluded from our schools, ought to be in common use
in them. Keeping all the while in view the object of popular education, the fitting of the
people by moral as well as by intellectual discipline for self-government, no one can doubt
that any system of instruction which overlooks the training and informing of the moral faculties
must be wretchedly and fatally defective. Crime and intellectual cultivation merely, so far
from being dissociated in history and statistics, are unhappily old acquaintances and tried
friends. To neglect the moral powers in education is to educate not quite half the man. To
cultivate the intellect only is to unhinge the mind and destroy the essential balance of the
mental powers; it is to light up a recess only the better to see how dark it is. And if this
is all that is done in popular education, then nothing, literally nothing, is done toward establishing
popular virtue and forming a moral people."

This is but a specimen of an invaluable document, which does honor to the heart and head of
him who penned it, and to the Legislature of the commonwealth by which it was adopted by almost
unparalleled unanimity.

The Hon. Samuel Young, the eminently distinguished superintendent of common schools in the
same state, in a report made in 1843, inculcates sentiments which so well accord with my own
views of the importance of weaving scriptural reading into the very warp and woof of popular
education, that I gladly add his testimony. "I regard the New Testament as in all respects
a suitable book to be daily read in our common schools, and I earnestly recommend its general
introduction for this purpose. As a mere reading-book, intended to convey a practical knowledge
of the English language, it is one of the best text-books in use; but this, although of great
use to the pupils, is of minor importance when the moral influences of the book are duly considered.
Education consists of something more than mere instruction. It is that training and discipline
of all the faculties of the mind which shall symmetrically and harmoniously develop the future
man for usefulness and for happiness in sustaining the various relations of life. It must be
based upon knowledge and virtue; and its gradual advancement must be strictly subordinated
to those cardinal and elementary principles of morality, which are nowhere so distinctly and
beautifully inculcated as in that book from whence we all derive our common faith. The nursery
and family fireside may accomplish much; the institutions of religion may exert a pervading
influence; but what is commenced in the hallowed sanctuary of the domestic circle, and periodically
inculcated at the altar, must be daily and hourly recognized in the common schools, that it
may exert an ever-present influence, enter into and form a part of every act of life, and become
thoroughly incorporated with the rapidly expanding character. The same incomparable standard
of moral virtue and excellence, which is expounded from the pulpit and the altar, and which
is daily held up to the admiration and imitation of the family circle, should also be reverently
kept before the mind and the heart in the daily exercises of the school."

I will add the testimony of another whom we all delight to honor. Never were sentiments uttered
more worthy to be remembered and repeated through all generations, than those which fell from
the Father of his Country in his Farewell Address to the American people. How noble, how elevated,
how just these parting words.

Washington was an enlightened Christian patriot, as well as a great general and a wise statesman.
The oracles which he consulted in all his perils, and in the perils of his country, were the
oracles of God.[29] No one of the fathers of the Revolution knew better than he did that religion
rests upon the Bible as its main pillar, and that as a knowledge and belief of the Bible are
essential to true religion, so they are to private and public morality. I can not doubt, says
the venerable President of Amherst College, that could the greatest among the great men of
his day add a codicil to his invaluable legacy, it would be, "Teach your children early to
read and love the Bible.

  [29] John Quincy Adams, during his long and eventful life, was
  accustomed to read daily portions of the Scriptures in several
  languages.

How few are aware of what the Bible has done for mankind, and still less of what it is destined
to accomplish. "Quench its light, and you blot out the brightest luminary from these lower
heavens. You bring back 'chaos and old night' to reign over the earth, and leave man, with
all his immortal energies and aspirations, to 'wander in the blackness of darkness forever.'
It was by constantly reading it that our Puritan fathers imbibed that unconquerable love of
civil and religious liberty which sustained them through all the 'perils of the sea and perils
of the wilderness.' It was from the Bible they drew those free and admired principles of civil
government that were so much in advance of the age in which they lived. It was this book by
which they 'resolved to go till they could find some better rule.'"

The Bible has built all our churches, and colleges, and school-houses; it has built our hospitals
and retreats for the insane, the deaf, and the blind; it has built the House of Refuge, the
Sailors' Home, and the Home for the Friendless. To it we are indebted for our homes, for our
property, and for all the safeguards of our domestic relations and happiness. It is under its
broad shield that we lie down in safety, without bolts or bars to protect us. It has given
us our free constitutions of civil government, and with them all the statutes and ordinances
of a great and independent people, whose territory extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
It is the industry, sobriety, and enterprise, which nothing but the Bible could ever inspire
and sustain, that have dug our canals, and built our thousand factories, and "clothed the hills
with flocks, and covered over the valleys with corn;" that have laid down our railways and
established telegraph lines, bringing the East into the neighborhood of the West, and enabling
the North to hold converse with the South. The Bible has directly and indirectly done all this
for us, and infinitely more. Let not, then, the book which has given to us sweet homes, and
happy families, and systems of public instruction, and has thus constituted us a great and
prosperous people--the book which diminishes our sorrows and multiplies our joys, and gives
to those who obey its precepts a "hope big with immortality"--let not this book be excluded
from the common schools of our country. In the name of patriotism, of philanthropy, and of
our common Christianity, let me, in behalf of the millions of youth in our country who will
otherwise remain ignorant of it, ask that, whatever else be excluded from our schools, there
be retained in them this Book of books, the BIBLE.

CHAPTER VIII.

THE IMPORTANCE OF POPULAR EDUCATION.

    Education, as the means of improving the mural and intellectual
    faculties, is, under all circumstances, a subject of the most
    imposing consideration. To rescue man from that state of degradation
    to which he is doomed unless redeemed by education; to unfold his
    physical, intellectual, and moral powers, and to fit him for those
    high destinies which his Creator has prepared for him, can not fail
    to excite the most ardent sensibility of the philosopher and
    philanthropist. A comparison of the savage that roams through the
    forest with the enlightened inhabitant of a civilized country would
    be a brief but impressive representation of the momentous importance
    of education.--Report of School Commissioners, New York, 1812.

He who has carefully perused the preceding chapters of this work is already aware that we regard
the subject of popular education as one of paramount importance. The object of devoting a chapter
to the special consideration of this subject at this time is, if possible, to remove from the
mind any remaining doubts in relation to it. The reader will bear in mind that we regard education
as having reference to the whole man--the body, the mind, and the heart; and that its object,
and, when rightly directed, its effect, is to make him a complete creature after his kind.
To his frame it should give vigor, activity, and beauty; to his intellect, power and thoughtfulness;
and to his heart, virtue and felicity.

We shall be the better prepared to appreciate the importance and necessity of a judicious system
of training and instruction if we consider that, in its absence, every individual will be educated
by circumstances. Let it be borne in mind, then, that all the children in every community will
be educated somewhere and somehow; and that it devolves upon citizens and parents to determine
whether the children of the present generation shall receive their training in the school-house
or in the streets; and if in the former, whether in good or poor schools.

In the discharge of my official duties in this state, I had occasion to visit two counties
in 1846 in which there were no organized common schools.[30] They were not, however, without
places of instruction, for in the shire town of each of those counties there were a billiard-room,
bar-rooms, and bowling-alleys. I was forcibly impressed with the remark of an Indian chief
residing in one of those counties. As he was passing along the streets one day, he discovered
a second bowling-alley in process of erection. He paused, and, surveying it attentively, remarked
to those at work upon it as follows: "You have here another long building going up rapidly;
and," he added, "is this the place where our children are to be educated?" Such keen and well-merited
rebuke rarely falls from human lips. Those two bowling-alleys, with their bars--indispensable
appendages--were thronged from six o'clock in the morning until past midnight, six days in
the week. They were, moreover, the very places where many of the youth of that village were
receiving their education. And who were their teachers? Idlers, tipplers, gamblers, profane
persons, Sabbath-breakers. Mark well this truth: as is the teacher, so will be the school.
Those pupils will graduate, it may be, at our poor-houses, at our county jails, or at the state
penitentiary. These debasing and corrupting appendages of civilization spent not all their
influence upon the white man; and this is what gave pungency to the withering satire of the
chief. They were at once working the ruin of the red man and of his pale neighbor.

  [30] Common schools have since been organized in both of those counties.

The rudest nations or individuals can not be said to be wholly without education. Even the
wildest savage is taught by his superiors not only the best mode of procuring food and shelter
known to his race, but also the most adroit manner of defending himself and destroying his
enemy. But we use the term in a higher, broader, and more capacious sense, as having reference
to the whole man, and the whole duration of his being. A volume might be filled in stating
and illustrating the advantages of education. We have only space to state and elucidate a few
propositions. We remark, then, first, that

EDUCATION DISSIPATES THE EVILS OF IGNORANCE.

     Ignorance is one principal cause of the want of virtue, and of the
     immoralities which abound in the world. Were we to take a survey of
     the moral state of the world as delineated in the history of
     nations, or as depicted by modern voyagers and travelers, we should
     find abundant illustration of the truth of this remark. We should
     find, in almost every instance, that ignorance of the character of
     the true God, and false conceptions of the nature of the worship
     and service he requires, have led, not only to the most obscene
     practices and immoral abominations, but to the perpetration of the
     most horrid cruelties.--DR. DICK.

The evils of ignorance are not few in number nor small in magnitude. The whole history of the
world justifies the statement that ignorant and uncultivated mind is prone to sensuality and
cruelty. In what countries, let me ask, are the people most given to the lowest forms of animal
gratification, and most regardless of the lives and happiness of others? Is it not in pagan
lands, over which moral and intellectual darkness broods, and where men are vile without shame,
and cruel without remorse? And if from pagan we pass to Christian countries, we shall find
that those in which education is least prevalent are the very ones in which there is the most
immorality, and the greatest indifference to the sufferings of animated and sentient beings.
Spain--in which, until recently, there was but one newspaper printed, and in which only about
one in thirty five of the people are instructed in schools--has a population about equal to
that of England and Wales. Popular education in the latter countries, although much behind
several of the other European states, is still greatly in advance of what it is in Spain, and
there is an equally marked difference in the state of morals in the people of these countries.
In England and Wales the whole number of convictions for murder in the year eighteen hundred
and twenty-six was thirteen, and the number convicted for wounding, etc., with intent to kill,
was fourteen; while in Spain, the number convicted during the same year was, for murder, twelve
hundred and thirty-three! and for maiming with intent to kill, seventeen hundred and seventy-three!
or a more than one hundred fold greater number than in the former countries. Facts like these
speak volumes in favor of the elevating influences of popular education, while they show most
conclusively the low and degraded condition to which people will sink in countries in which
education is neglected.

Spain affords an apt illustration of the truth of the statement just made, that ignorant and
uncultivated people are prone to sensuality and cruelty. Scenes of cruelty and blood constitute
the favorite amusement of the Spaniards, their greatest delight being in bull-fights. An eye-witness
describes the manner in which they conduct themselves during these appalling scenes in the
following language. "The intense interest which they feel in this game is visible throughout,
and often loudly expressed. An astounding shout always accompanies a critical moment. Whether
it be the bull or man who is in danger, their joy is excessive; but their greatest sympathy
is given to the feats of the BULL! If the picador receives the bull gallantly and forces him
to retreat, or if the matadore courageously faces and wounds the bull, they applaud these acts
of science and valor; but if the bull overthrow the horse and his rider, or if the matadore
miss his aim and the bull seems ready to gore him, their delight knows no bounds. And it is
certainly a fine spectacle to see thousands of spectators rise simultaneously, as they always
do when the interest is intense. The greatest and most crowded theater in Europe presents nothing
half so imposing as this. But how barbarous, how brutal is the whole exhibition! Could an English
audience witness the scenes that are repeated every week in Madrid, a universal burst of 'shame!'
would follow the spectacle of a horse gored and bleeding, and actually treading upon his own
entrails while he gallops round the arena. Even the appearance of the goaded bull could not
be borne, panting, covered with wounds and blood, lacerated by darts, and yet brave and resolute
to the end.

"The spectacle continued two hours and a half, and during that time there were seven bulls
killed and six horses. When the last bull was dispatched, the people immediately rushed into
the arena, and the carcass was dragged out amid the most deafening shouts."--Spain in 1830,
vol. i., p. 191.

The same writer, after describing another fight, in which one bull had killed three horses
and one man, and remained master of the arena, remarks, that "this was a time to observe the
character of the people. When the unfortunate picador was killed, in place of a general exclamation
of horror and loud expressions of pity, the universal cry was 'Que es bravo ese toro! ('Ah,
the admirable bull!') The whole scene produced the most unbounded delight; the greater the
horror, the greater was the shouting, and the more vehement the expressions of satisfaction.
I did not perceive a single female avert her head or betray the slightest symptom of wounded
feeling."--Vol. i., p. 195.

A correct system of public instruction develops a character widely different from that here
brought to light. Instead of a love for vicious excitement, it cultivates a taste for simple
and innocent pleasures, and gives to its subjects a command over their passions, and a disposition
habitually to control them. It acquaints them with their duty, and enables them to find their
highest pleasure in its discharge. They order their pursuits and choose their employments with
reference to their own advantage, it is true; but still, a higher, and the controlling motive
with them is, the promotion of the best good of the community in which they live. In short,
their supreme desire is to co-operate with the beneficent Creator in advancing the permanent
interests of the whole human family; in themselves obeying, and leading others to obey, all
the laws which God has ordained for the government and well-being of his creatures.

Education, we said, dissipates the evils of ignorance. But in this country we hardly know what
popular ignorance is. The most illiterate among us have derived many and inestimable advantages
from our systems of public instruction. Occasionally persons are found among us who can neither
read nor write. But even such persons insensibly imbibe ideas and moral influences from the
more cultivated society about them which, in countries less favored, are denied to multitudes.
Individuals who have had no early advantages for learning, who have never even entered a school-house,
but have grown up amid a generally intelligent population, trained by the institutions established
by our fathers, have in many instances acquired a mental character and influence which, but
for these fortuitous circumstances, they could not have attained. The very excellence of our
systems of education in many states of the Union, and the vital and pervading influence of
the schools upon the public mind, reaching as they do, and improving even those that remain
ignorant of letters, do not allow us to see the full extent of our obligation to them. This
remark applies to all civilized countries where any systems of general education are adopted,
but perhaps not to so great an extent in any other country as in our own.

The evils which flow from ignorance are deplorable enough in the case of individuals, although,
as we have seen, the disastrous consequences are limited in the case of those who live surrounded
by an intelligent community. But the general ignorance of large numbers and entire classes
of men, unreached by the elevating influence of the educated, acting under the unchastened
stimulus of the passions, and excited by the various causes of discontent which are constantly
occurring in the progress of human affairs, is not unfrequently productive of scenes, the contemplation
of which makes humanity shudder. The following extract from a foreign journal affords a pertinent
illustration of the evils which flow from popular ignorance. It relates to the outrages committed
by the peasantry in a part of Hungary in consequence of the ravages of the cholera in that region.

"The suspicion that the cholera was caused by poisoning the wells was universal among the peasantry
of the counties of Zips and Zemplin, and every one was fully convinced of its truth. The first
commotion arose in Klucknow, where, it is said, some peasants died in consequence of taking
the preservatives; whether by an immoderate use of medicine, or whether they thought they were
to take chloride of lime internally, is not known. This story, with a sudden and violent breaking
out of the cholera at Klucknow, led the peasants to a notion of the poisoning of the wells,
which spread like lightning. In the sequel, in the attack of the estate of Count Czaki, a servant
of the chief bailiff was on the point of being murdered, when, to save his life, he offered
to disclose something important. He said that he received from his master two pounds of poisonous
powder, with orders to throw it into the wells, and, with an ax over his head, took oath publicly,
in the church, to the truth of his statement. These statements, and the fact that the peasants,
when they forcibly entered the houses of the land-owners, every where found chloride of lime,
which they took for the poisonous powder, confirmed their suspicions, and drove the people
to madness. In this state of excitement, they committed the most appalling excesses. Thus,
for instance, when a detachment of thirty soldiers, headed by an ensign, attempted to restore
order in Klucknow, the peasants, who were ten times their number, fell upon them; the soldiers
were released, but the ensign was bound, tortured with scissors and knives, then beheaded,
and his head fixed on a pike as a trophy. A civil officer in company with the military was
drowned, his carriage broken, and, chloride of lime being found in the carriage, one of the
inmates was compelled to eat it till he vomited blood, which again confirmed the notion of
poison. On the attack of the house of the lord at Klucknow, the countess saved her life by
piteous entreaties: but the chief bailiff, in whose house chloride of lime was unhappily found,
was killed, together with his son, a little daughter, a clerk, a maid, and two students who
boarded with him. So the bands went from village to village; wherever a nobleman or a physician
was found, death was his lot; and in a short time it was known that the high constable of the
county of Zemplin, and several counts, nobles, and parish priests, had been murdered. A clergyman
was hanged because he refused to take an oath that he had thrown poison into a well; the eyes
of a countess were put out, and innocent children cut to pieces. Count Czaki, having first
ascertained that his family was safe, fled from his estate at the risk of his life; but he
was stopped at Kirtchtrauf, pelted with stones, and wounded all over, torn from his horse,
and only saved by a worthy merchant who fell on him, crying, 'Now I have got the rascal.' He
drew the count into a neighboring convent, where his wounds were dressed, and a refuge afforded
him. His secretary was struck from his horse with an ax, but saved in a similar manner, and
in the evening conveyed with his master to Leutschau."[31]

  [31] Quoted from an address delivered in Boston by Edward Everett.

A little knowledge on the part of the peasantry would have prevented these horrible scenes.
Had they learned even the elements of physiology and chemistry, they would have known that
cleanliness is essential to health at all times, and that during the prevalence of a malignant
epidemic it is doubly needful. They would have known, also, that chloride of lime is not a
medicine to be taken internally, but that it is very useful for disinfecting offensive apartments,
and that its tendency, when properly used, would be to counteract the cause of the disease
which they so much dreaded.

Among all nations, and in all ages of the world, ignorance has not only debarred mankind from
many exquisite and sublime enjoyments, but has created innumerable unfounded alarms, which
greatly increase the sum of human misery. In the early ages of the world, a total eclipse of
the sun or of the moon was regarded with the utmost consternation, as if some unusual catastrophe
had been about to befall the universe. Believing that the moon in an eclipse was sickening
or dying, through the influence of enchanters, the trembling spectators had recourse to the
ringing of bells, the sounding of trumpets, the beating of brazen vessels, and to loud and
horrid exclamations, in order to break the enchantment, and to drown the muttering of witches,
that the moon might not hear them. Nor are such foolish opinions and customs yet banished from
the world.

Comets, too, with their blazing tails, were long regarded, and still are by many, as harbingers
of divine vengeance, presaging famines and inundations, or the downfall of princes and the
destruction of empires. The northern lights have been frequently gazed at with similar apprehensions,
whole provinces having been thrown into consternation by the fantastic coruscations of these
lambent meteors. Some pretend to see in these harmless lights armies mixing in fierce encounter
and fields streaming with blood, while others behold states overthrown, earthquakes, inundations,
pestilences, and the most dreadful calamities. Because some one or other of these calamities
formerly happened soon after the appearance of a comet or the blaze of an aurora, therefore
they are considered either as the causes or the prognostics of such events.

Popular ignorance has given rise to the practice of judicial astrology; an art which, with
all its foolish notions so fatal to the peace of mankind, has been practiced in every period
of time. Under a belief that the characters and the fates of men are dependent on the various
aspects of the stars and conjunctions of the planets, the most unfounded apprehensions, as
well as the most delusive hopes, have been excited by the professors of this fallacious science.
Such impositions on the credulity of mankind are founded on the grossest absurdity and the
most palpable ignorance of the nature of things; still, in the midst of the light of science
which the present century has shed upon the world, the astrologer meets with a rich support[32]
even in the metropolis of Great Britain; and soothsayers, if not astrologers, get great gain
by their craft in various portions of the United States. The extensive annual sale of hundreds
of thousands of copies of almanacs that abound in astrological predictions in the United Stales
and in Great Britain, and the extent to which they are consulted, affords a striking proof
of the belief which is still attached to the doctrines of this fallacious science, and of the
ignorance and credulity from which such a belief proceeds.

  [32] See Appendix to Dick's Improvement of Society, p. 338.

Shooting stars, fiery meteors, lunar rainbows, and other atmospherical phenomena, have likewise
been considered by some as ominous of impending calamities, but they are regarded in a very
different light by scientific observers. The most sublime phenomenon of shooting stars of which
the world has furnished any record was witnessed throughout the United States on the morning
of the 13th of November, 1833. This astonishing exhibition covered no inconsiderable portion
of the earth's surface. The first appearance was every where that of fire-works of the most
imposing grandeur, covering the entire vault of heaven with myriads of fire-balls resembling
sky-rockets; but the most brilliant sky-rockets and fire-works of art bear less relation to
the splendors of this celestial exhibition than the twinkling of the most tiny star to the
broad glare of the noonday sun. Their coruscations were bright, gleaming, and incessant, and
they fell thick as the flakes in the early snows of December.

While these scenes of grandeur were viewed with unspeakable delight by enlightened scientific
observers, the ignorant and superstitious were overpowered with horror and dismay. The description
which a gentleman of South Carolina gave of the effect produced by this phenomenon upon his
ignorant blacks will apply well to many hardly better informed white persons. "I was suddenly
awakened," said he, "by the most distressing cries that ever fell upon my ears. Shrieks of
horror and cries of mercy I could hear from most of the negroes of three plantations, amounting
in all to about six or eight hundred. While earnestly listening for the cause, I heard a faint
voice near the door calling my name: I arose, and, taking my sword, stood at the door. At this
moment I heard the same voice still beseeching me to rise and saying, 'O! my God, the world
is on fire!' I then opened the door, and it is difficult to say which excited me most, the
awfulness of the scene or the distressed cries of the negroes. Upward of one hundred lay prostrate
on the ground, some speechless, and some with the bitterest cries, but most with their hands
raised, imploring God to save the world and them.

Those harmless meteors, the ignes fatui, which hover above moist and fenny places in the night-time,
emitting a glimmering light, have been regarded by the ignorant as malicious spirits endeavoring
to deceive the bewildered traveler and lead him to destruction. The plaintive note of the mourning
dove, the ticking noise of the little insect called the death-watch, the howling of a dog in
the night-time, the meeting of a bitch with whelps, or a snake lying in the road, the breaking
of a looking-glass, and even the falling of salt from the table, and the curling of a fiber
of wick in a burning candle, together with many other equally harmless incidents, have been
regarded with apprehensions of terror, being considered as unfailing signs of impending disasters
or of approaching death.

Dr. Dick remarks, that in the Highlands of Scotland--and it should be borne in mind that the
Scotch are, as a nation, better instructed, and more moral and religious in their habits, than
any other people in Europe--the motions and appearances of the clouds were, not long ago, considered
ominous of disastrous events. On the evening before new year's day, if a black cloud appeared
in any part of the horizon, it was thought to prognosticate a plague, a famine, or the death
of some great man in that part of the country over which it seemed to hang; and in order to
ascertain the place threatened by the omen, the motions of the clouds were often watched through
the whole night. In the same country, the inhabitants regard certain days as unlucky, or ominous
of bad fortune. The day of the week on which the third of May falls is deemed unlucky throughout
the year.

With a very slight change, a part of this description would apply well to our own country,
even up to the present time. How many thousands of days are lost annually in the United States
in consequence of superstitious fears in relation to setting out upon a journey, entering upon
a new pursuit of any kind, or even beginning to plant or plow on Friday, the unlucky day of
the Americans. How many persons have had misfortunes attend them all their lives because they
were born, or christened, or married on Friday! How many houses have been burned because they
were begun, raised, or moved into on Friday! How many steamboats and vessels have been burned
or wrecked because they were launched or sailed on Friday! And yet, strange as it may seem,
this is the very day on which Columbus set sail on a voyage that resulted in the discovery
of the New World.

Many people, and in some instances whole communities, always commence plowing, sowing, and
reaping on Tuesday, though by this rule the most favorable weather for these purposes is frequently
lost. Others, again, will not, on any account, perform certain kinds of labor on Friday. The
age of the moon is also much attended to in many parts of the world. Among the vulgar Highlanders,
an opinion prevails, that if a house takes fire while the moon is in the decrease, the family
will from that time decline in its circumstances and sink into poverty. In this country, equally
unfounded and ridiculous opinions are entertained. Passing by the more commonly received opinions
that if swine are killed in the old of the moon, the pork will shrink in the pot; that seed
sown at this time will be less likely to do well, etc., etc., I will mention one or two instances
of opinions which, although equally well founded, are less commonly received, and which may
therefore more forcibly impress the popular mind. A few years ago, I spent some months in a
neighboring state, in a community where the belief was commonly entertained that shingles should
not be laid nor stakes driven in the old of the moon, because the former would be more likely
to warp, and the latter to be thrown by the frost. The same and kindred opinions are extensively
held in various portions of the United States.

These are a few, and but a very few, of the superstitious notions and vain fears by which the
great majority of the human race, in every age and country, have been enslaved, as he who will
take the pains to peruse Dr. Dick's admirable treatise on the improvement of society by the
diffusion of knowledge can not fail to be convinced. That such absurd notions should ever have
prevailed is a most grating and humiliating thought, when we consider the noble faculties with
which man is endowed. That they still prevail to a great extent, even in our own country, is
a striking proof that as yet we are, as a people, but just emerging from the gloom of intellectual
darkness. The prevalence of such opinions is to be regretted, not only on account of the groundless
alarms they create, but chiefly on account of the false ideas they inspire with regard to the
nature of the Supreme Ruler of the universe, and of his arrangements in the government of the
world. He whose mind is enlightened with true science perceives throughout all nature the most
striking evidences of benevolent design, and rejoices in the benignity of the Great Parent
of the universe, discovering nothing in the arrangements of the Creator, in any department
of his works, which has a direct tendency to produce pain to any intelligent or sensitive being.
The superstitious man, on the contrary, contemplates the sky, the air, the waters, and the
earth as filled with malicious beings, ever ready to haunt him with terror or to plot his destruction.
The former contemplates the Deity directing the movements of the material world by fixed and
invariable laws, which none but himself can counteract or suspend. The latter views these movements
as continually liable to be controlled by capricious and malignant beings to gratify the most
trivial passions. How very different, of course, must be their conceptions and feelings respecting
the attributes and government of the Supreme Being! While the one views him as the infinitely
wise and benevolent Father, whose paternal care and goodness inspire confidence and affection,
the other must regard him, in a certain degree, as a capricious being, and offer up his adorations
under the influence of fear.

These and like notions have also an evident tendency to habituate the mind to false principles
and processes of reasoning which unfit it for legitimate conclusions in its researches after
truth. They manifestly chain down the understanding, and unfit it for the appreciation of those
noble and enlarged views which revelation and modern science exhibit of the order, extent,
and economy of the universe. It is lamentable to reflect that so many thousands of beings endowed
with the faculty of reason, who can not by any means be persuaded of the motion of the earth,
and the distances and magnitudes of the heavenly bodies, should swallow, without the least
hesitation, opinions ten thousand times more improbable. Notwithstanding the mathematical certainty
of the truth of the Copernican system of astronomy, I have never yet become extensively acquainted
with any community in which I have not found many persons professing a respectable degree of
intelligence, and even official members of orthodox churches, who entirely discredit its sublime
teachings; and yet some of these very persons find little difficulty in believing that an old
woman can transform herself into a hare, and wing her way through the air on a broomstick.
What contracted notions such persons must have of the almightiness of the Deity, and of the
infinite depth of meaning of the following and like passages of Scripture: The heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handy work. Spain and Hungary were referred
to in illustration. We are now prepared to remark, what is worse still, that where such superstitious
notions as we have been considering are held, even by persons who are somewhat educated, they
almost invariably lead to the perpetration of deeds of cruelty and injustice. Many of the barbarities
committed in pagan countries, both in their religious worship and their civil polity, and most
of the cruelties inflicted on the victims of the Romish Inquisition, have flowed from this
source.[33] Nor are the annals of Great Britain and the United States deficient in examples
of this kind. About the commencement of the last century, the belief in witchcraft, which was
almost universal throughout Christendom, was held in both of these countries. The laws of England,
which admitted its existence and punished it with death, were adopted by the Puritans of New
England, and in less than twenty years from the founding of the colony, one individual was
tried and executed for the supposed crime. Half a century later the delusion broke out in Salem.
A minister, whose daughter and niece were subject to convulsions accompanied by extraordinary
symptoms, supposing they were bewitched, cast his suspicions on an Indian woman who lived in
the house, and who was whipped until she confessed herself a witch; and the truth of the confession,
although obtained in this way, was not doubted. During the same year more than fifty persons
were terrified into the confession of witchcraft, twenty of whom were put to death. Neither
age, sex, nor station afforded any safeguard against a charge for this supposed crime. Women
and children not only were its victims, but magistrates were condemned, and a clergyman of
the highest respectability was among the executed. So late as 1722 a woman was burned for witchcraft
in Scotland, which was among the last executions in that country.

  [33] In the Duchy of Lorraine, nine hundred females were delivered over
  to the flames for being witches, by one inquisitor alone. Under this
  accusation, it is reckoned that upward of thirty thousand women have
  perished by the hands of the Inquisition.--Quoted by Dr. Dick from
  "Inquisition Unmasked."

It appears that these superstitious notions, so far from being innocent and harmless speculations,
lead to the most deplorable results; they ought, therefore, to be undermined and thoroughly
eradicated by all persons who wish to promote the happiness and well-being of general society.
This duty is especially incumbent upon parents and teachers, and can be effected only by rendering
correct early education universal. Ignorance of the laws and economy of nature is the one great
source of these absurd opinions. They have not only no foundation in nature or experience,
but are directly opposed to both. In proportion, then, as we advance in our researches into
Nature's economy and laws, shall we perceive their futility and absurdity. As in other cases,
take away the cause, and the effect will be removed.

Education will dissipate all these evils. It is true that an acquaintance with a number of
dead languages, with Roman and Grecian antiquities, with the subtleties of metaphysics, with
pagan mythology, and with politics and poetry, may coexist with these superstitions, as was
true in the case of the late Dr. Samuel Johnson, who believed in ghosts and in the second sight.
However important in other respects these departments of an extensive and varied education
may be, they do not form an effectual barrier against the admission of superstitious opinions.
In order to do this, the mind must be directed to the study of the material universe, to contemplate
the various appearances it presents, and to mark well the uniform results of those invariable
laws by which it is governed. In particular, the attention should be directed to those discoveries
which have been made by philosophers in the different departments of nature and art during
the last two centuries. For this purpose, the study of natural history, as recording the various
facts respecting the atmosphere, the waters, the earth, and animated beings, combined with
the study of natural philosophy and astronomy, as explaining the causes of the phenomena of
nature, will have a happy tendency to eradicate from the mind superstitious and false notions,
and at the same time will present to view objects of delightful contemplation. Let a person
be once thoroughly convinced that nature is uniform in her operations, and governed by regular
laws impressed by an all-wise and benevolent Being, and he will soon be inspired with confidence,
and will not easily be alarmed at any occasional phenomena which at first sight might appear
as exceptions to the general rule.

Let persons be taught, for example, that eclipses are occasioned merely by the shadow of one
opaque body falling upon another; that they are the necessary result of the inclination of
the moon's orbit to that of the earth; that, if these orbits were in the same plane, there
would be an eclipse of the sun and of the moon every month, the former occurring at the change,
and the latter at the full of the moon; that the times when they do actually take place depend
on the new or full moon happening at or near the points of intersection of the orbits of the
earth and moon, and that other planets which have moons experience eclipses of a similar nature.
Let them also be taught that the comets are regular bodies belonging to our system, which finish
their revolutions and appear and disappear in stated periods of time; that the northern lights,
though seldom seen in southern climes, are frequent in the regions of the North, and supply
the inhabitants with light in the absence of the sun, and have probably a relation to the magnetic
and electric fluids; that the ignes fatui are harmless lights, formed by the ignition of a
certain species of gas produced in the soils above which they hover; and that the notes of
the death-watch, so far from being presages of death, are ascertained to be the notes of love
and presages of hymeneal intercourse among these little insects.

Let rational information of this kind be imparted to people generally, and they will learn
to contemplate nature with tranquillity and composure. A more beneficial effect than this will
at the same time be produced, for those very objects which were formerly beheld with alarm
will now be converted into sources of enjoyment, and be contemplated with emotions of delight.

To remove the groundless apprehensions which arise from the fear of invisible and incorporeal
beings, let persons be instructed in the various optical illusions to which we are subject,
arising from the intervention of fogs, and the indistinctness of vision in the night-time,
which makes us frequently mistake a bush that is near us for a large tree at a distance, and
let them be taught that under the influence of these illusions a timid imagination will transform
the indistinct image of a cow or a horse into a terrific phantom of a monstrous size. Let them
also be taught, by a selection of well-authenticated facts, the powerful influence of the imagination
in creating ideal forms, especially when under the dominion of fear; the effects produced by
the workings of conscience when harassed by guilt; let them be taught the effects produced
by lively dreams, by strong doses of opium, by drunkenness, hysteric passions, madness, and
other disorders that affect the mind. Let the experiments of optics, and the striking phenomena
produced by electricity, galvanism, magnetism, and the different gases, be exhibited to their
view, together with details of the results which have been produced by various mechanical contrivances.
In fine, let their attention be directed to the foolish, whimsical, and extravagant notions
attributed to apparitions, and to their inconsistency with the wise and benevolent arrangements
of the Governor of the universe.

There is no rational foundation for entertaining any doubts but that, could such instructions
as I have suggested be universally given, the effect would be the banishment of superstitions
of the nature contemplated from among mankind; for they have uniformly produced this effect
on every mind which has been thus enlightened. Where is the man to be found whose mind is enlightened
by the doctrines and discoveries of modern science, and who yet remains the slave of superstitious
notions and vain fears? Of all the philosophers of America and Europe, is there one who is
alarmed at an eclipse, at a comet, at an ignis fatuus, or at the notes of a death-watch? or
who postpones his experiments on account of what is called an unlucky day? Who ever heard of
a specter appearing to such a person, dragging him from bed at the dead hour of midnight, to
wander through the forest, trembling with fear? Such beings appear only to the ignorant and
illiterate, at least to those who are unacquainted with natural science, and we never hear
of their appearing to any who did not previously believe in their existence. But should philosophers
be freed from such terrific visions, if substantial knowledge has not the power of banishing
them from the mind? Why should supernatural beings feel so shy in conversing with men of science?
These would, indeed, be the fittest persons to whom they might impart their secrets, and communicate
information respecting the invisible world; but it never falls to their lot to be favored with
such visits. It may therefore be concluded that the diffusion of useful knowledge among mankind
would infallibly dissipate those groundless fears which have banished much of happiness from
the human family, and particularly among the lower orders of society.[34]

  [34] Dr. Dick, to whom I have frequently referred, and whose writings I
  have freely consulted, expresses in a note a sentiment in which I fully
  concur. "It would be unfair," says he, "to infer, from any expression
  here used, that the author denies the possibility of supernatural
  visions and appearances. We are assured from the records of sacred
  history that beings of an order superior to the human race have 'at
  sundry times and in divers manners' made their appearance to men. But
  there is the most marked difference between vulgar apparitions and the
  celestial messengers to which the records of revelation refer. They
  appeared not to old women and clowns, but to patriarchs, prophets, and
  apostles. They appeared not to frighten the timid and to create
  unnecessary alarm, but to declare 'tidings of great joy.' They appeared
  not to reveal such paltry secrets as the place where a pot of gold or
  silver is concealed, or where a lost ring may be found, but to
  communicate intelligence worthy of a God to reveal, and of the utmost
  importance for man to receive. In these and many other respects, there
  is the most striking contrast between popular ghosts and the
  supernatural communications and appearances recorded in Scripture."

I might, perhaps, safely dismiss this subject, and proceed to the consideration of other topics;
but, before doing so, it may be well to state that many of the views here presented, and all
that come within the range of the subjects discussed by him, are fully sustained by Dr. Lardner,
whose popular lectures on science and art have been so well received both in Europe and America.
His publishers justly remark, that "probably no public lecturer ever continued, for the same
length of time, to collect around him so numerous audiences." The author himself states, in
the preface to his Lectures,[35] that from November, 1841, when he commenced his public lectures
in the lecture-room of Clinton Hall, in New York, to the close of the year 1844, when he concluded
his public labors in this country, he "visited every considerable city and town of the Union,
from Boston to New Orleans, and from New York to St. Louis. Most of the principal cities were
twice visited, and several courses were given in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Nor did
the appetite for this species of intellectual entertainment appear to flag by repetition."

  [35] In two large volumes, published by Greeley and McElrath, New York.

I can not forbear making a few quotations from the preface to the work under consideration,
which are creditable to the comparative intelligence of the American people, and show the avidity
with which they seek instruction and useful knowledge. Dr. Lardner observes, that "it was usual
on each evening to deliver from two to four of the essays which compose the contents of the
present volumes, and the duration of the entertainment was from two to three hours. On every
occasion the most profound interest was evinced on the part of the audience, and the most unremitting
and silent attention was given. These assemblies consisted of persons of both sexes, of every
age, from the elder classes of pupils in the schools to their grandfathers and grandmothers.
Frequently the audiences amounted to twelve hundred, and sometimes, as at the Philadelphia
Museum, they exceeded two thousand. Nor was the manifestation of this interest confined, as
might be imagined, to the northern Atlantic cities, where education is known to be attended
to, and where, as in New England, the diffusion of useful knowledge is regarded as a paramount
duty of the state. The same crowded assemblies were collected, for a long succession of nights,
in the largest theaters of each of the southern and western cities; in the Charleston Theater;
the Mobile Theater; the St. Charles Theater, New Orleans; the Vicksburg and Jackson Theaters,
Mississippi; the St. Louis Theater, Missouri; and in the theaters of Cincinnati, Pittsburg,
and other western and central cities.

"It can not be denied that such facts are symptomatic of a very remarkable condition of the
public mind, more especially among a people who are admitted to be, more than any other nation,
engrossed by money-getting and by the more material pursuits of life. The less pretension to
eloquence and the attractive graces of oratory the lecturer can offer, the more surprising
is the result, and the more creditable to the intelligence of the American people. It is certain
that a similar intellectual entertainment, clogged, as it necessarily was, with a pecuniary
condition of admission, would fail to attract an audience even in the most polished and enlightened
cities of Europe."

While these statements are highly creditable to the American people, the lectures themselves
contain paragraphs which show that the popular mind even in our own country is not sufficiently
enlightened to eradicate the superstitions just considered.

THE MOON AND THE WEATHER.--Dr. Lardner, in a lecture on the moon, in answer to the question,
Does the moon influence the weather? says,[36] It is asserted, first, that at the epochs of
new and full moon, and at the quarters, there is generally a change of weather; and, secondly,
that the phases of the moon, or, in other words, the relative position of the moon and sun
in regard to the earth, is the cause of these changes. Now these and kindred opinions are very
extensively held in this country. But the doctor refers to meteorological tables, constructed
in various countries after the most extensive and careful observation, and the result is that
no correspondence exists between the condition of the weather and the phases of the moon. He
hence, after a full examination, comes to the conclusion that "the condition of the weather
as to change, or in any other respect, has, as a matter of fact, no correspondence whatever
with the lunar phases."

  [36] See Lectures on Science and Art, vol. i., p. 315.

In another lecture on the moon and the weather, the following decisive opinion is expressed:
"From all that has been stated, it follows then, conclusively, that the popular notions concerning
the influence of the lunar phases on the weather have no foundation in the theory, and no correspondence
with observed facts."[37]

  [37] Ibid., p. 419-420.

TIME FOR FELLING TIMBER.--In another lecture on lunar influences, Dr. Lardner observes that
"there is an opinion generally entertained that timber should be felled only during the decline
of the moon; for if it be cut down during its increase, it will not be of a good or durable
quality. This impression prevails in various countries. It is acted upon in England, and is
made the ground of legislation in France. The forest laws of the latter country interdict the
cutting of timber during the increase of the moon. In the extensive forests of Germany, the
same opinion is entertained and acted upon, with the most undoubting confidence in its truth.
Sauer, a superintendent of some of these districts, assigns what he believes to be its physical
cause. According to him, the increase of the moon causes the sap to ascend in the timber, and,
on the other hand, the decrease of the moon causes it to descend. If the timber, therefore,
be cut during the decrease of the moon, it will be cut in a dry state, the sap having retired,
and the wood, therefore, will be compact, solid, and durable. But if it be cut during the increase
of the moon, it will be felled with the sap in it, and will therefore be more spongy, more
easily attacked by worms, more difficult to season, and more readily split and warped by changes
of temperature.

"Admitting for a moment the reality of this supposition concerning the motion of the sap, it
would follow that the proper time for felling the timber would be the new moon, that being
the epoch at which the descent of the sap would have been made, and the ascent not yet commenced.
But can there be imagined, in the whole range of natural science, a physical relation more
extraordinary and unaccountable than this supposed correspondence between the movement of the
sap and the phases of the moon? Assuredly theory affords not the slightest countenance to such
a supposition; but let us inquire as to the fact whether it be really the case that the quality
of timber depends upon the state of the moon at the time it is felled.

"M. Duhamel Monceau, a celebrated French agriculturist, has made direct and positive experiments
for the purpose of testing this question, and has clearly and conclusively shown that the qualities
of timber felled in different parts of the lunar month are the same. M. Duhamel felled a great
many trees of the same age, growing from the same soil, and exposed to the same aspect, and
never found any difference in the quality of the timber, when he compared those which were
felled in the decline of the moon with those which were felled during its increase: in general,
they have afforded timber of the same quality. He adds, however, that by a circumstance which
was doubtless fortuitous, a slight difference was manifested in favor of timber which had been
felled between the new and full moon, contrary to popular opinion."

SUPPOSED LUNAR INFLUENCES.--It is an aphorism received by all gardeners and agriculturists
in Europe, remarks the same author, that vegetables, plants, and trees, which are expected
to flourish and grow with vigor, should be planted, grafted, and pruned during the increase
of the moon. This opinion, however, he thinks is altogether erroneous; for the experiments
and observations of several French agriculturists have clearly established the fact that the
increase or decrease of the moon has no appreciable influence on the phenomena of vegetation.

This erroneous prejudice prevails also on the American continent. A French author states that,
in Brazil, cultivators plant during the decline of the moon all vegetables whose roots are
used as food, and that, on the contrary, they plant during the increasing moon the sugar-cane,
maize, rice, beans, etc., and those which bear the food upon their stocks and branches. Experiments,
however, were made and reported by M. de Chauvalon, at Martinique, on vegetables of both kinds,
planted at different times in the lunar month, and no appreciable difference in their qualities
was discovered.

There are some traces of a principle adopted by the South American agronomes (farmers), according
to which they treat the two classes of plants distinguished by the production of fruit on their
roots or on their branches differently; but there are none in the European aphorisms. The directions
of Pliny are still more specific: he prescribes the time of the full moon for sowing beans,
and that of the new moon for lentils. "Truly," says M. Arago, "we have need of a robust faith
to admit, without proof, that the moon, at the distance of two hundred and forty thousand miles,
shall, in one position, act advantageously upon the vegetation of beans, and that in the opposite
position, and at the same distance, she shall be propitious to lentils."

Dr. Lardner gives numerous and extended illustrations of the supposed influence of the moon
on the growth of grain, on wine-making,[38] on the color of the complexion, on putrefaction,
on the size of shell-fish, on the quantity of marrow in the bones of animals, on the number
of births, on mental derangement, and other human maladies, etc., etc.

  [38] On this subject the prevailing opinions in different countries
  disagree, as they do also on some of the others.

The influence on the phenomena of human maladies imputed to the moon is very ancient. Hippocrates
had so strong a faith in the influence of celestial objects upon animated beings, that he expressly
recommends no physician to be trusted who is ignorant of astronomy. Galen, following Hippocrates,
maintained the same opinion, especially of the influence of the moon. The critical days, or
crises, were the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first of the disease, corresponding to the
intervals between the moon's principal phases. While the doctrine of alchemists prevailed,
the human body was considered as a microcosm, or an epitome of the universe, the heart representing
the sun, and the brain the moon. The planets had each his proper influence: Jupiter presided
over the lungs, Saturn over the spleen, Venus over the kidneys, and Mercury over the organs
of generation. The term lunacy, which still designates unsoundness of mind, is a relic of these
grotesque notions, and is defined by Dr. Webster as "a species of insanity or madness, formerly
supposed to be influenced by the moon, or periodical in the month." But even this term may
now be said, in some degree, to be banished from the nomenclature of medicine; it has, however,
taken refuge in that receptacle of all antiquated absurdities of phraseology--the law--lunatic
being still the term for the subject who is incapable of managing his own affairs.

Sanctorius, whose name is celebrated in physics for the invention of the thermometer, held
it as a principle that a healthy man gained two pounds' weight at the beginning of every lunar
month, which he lost toward its completion. This opinion appears to have been founded on experiments
made upon himself, and affords another instance of a fortuitous coincidence hastily generalized.

For all the progress that has been made in this country toward the removal from the popular
mind of the numerous corrupting and debasing absurdities which have hitherto enslaved it, we
are indebted to our enlightened and chastened systems of popular education; and to these, and
to these only, may we confidently look for entire freedom from the thraldom.

EDUCATION INCREASES THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF LABOR.

    Education has a power of ministering to our personal and material
    wants beyond all other agencies, whether excellence of climate,
    spontaneity of production, mineral resources, or mines of silver and
    gold. Every wise parent, every wise community, desiring the
    prosperity of its children even in the most worldly sense, will
    spare no pains in giving them a generous education.--HORACE MANN.

    The best educated are always the best paid.--Foreign Report.

The desirableness of education is manifest, view it in what light we may, and whether as affecting
individuals or communities. We have already seen that education, and that alone, will dissipate
the evils of ignorance. We now propose to discuss the equally tenable proposition that education
increases the productiveness of labor.

That knowledge is power has become a proverb. If it be asked why the labor of a man is more
valuable than the same amount of physical effort put forth by a brute, the ready answer is,
It is because man combines intelligence with his labor. A single yoke of oxen will do more
in one day at plowing than forty men; yet the oxen may be had for fifty cents a day, while
each of the men can earn a dollar. Physical exertion in this case, combined with ordinary skill,
is eighty times more valuable than the same amount of brute force. The strength of the ox is
of no account without some one to guide and apply it, while the power of man is guided by intelligence
within.

In proportion as man's intelligence increases is his labor more valuable. A small compensation
is the reward of mere physical power, while skill, combined with a moderate amount of strength,
commands high wages. The labor of an ignorant man is scarcely more valuable than the same amount
of brute force; but the services of an intelligent, skillful person are a hundred fold more
productive. I will pause and illustrate, for I wish to have every person who arises from the
perusal of these pages do so with the fullest conviction that mental culture is of the highest
importance even in the ordinary departments of human industry. It is, indeed, hardly less important
for the man of business, the farmer, or the mechanic, than for statesmen, legislators, and
members of the so-called learned professions.

An intelligent farmer of my acquaintance having a piece of greensward to break up, and having
three work-horses, determined to employ them all. He hence, possessing some mechanical skill,
himself constructed a three-horse whipple-tree, by means of which he advantageously combined
the strength of his horses. A less intelligent neighbor, pleased with the novel appearance
of three horses working abreast, resolved to try the experiment himself. But not possessing
the skill requisite to construct such a whipple-tree, he waited till his better-informed and
more expert neighbor had got through with his, and then, borrowing it, tried the experiment
with his own team. Early one morning, and full of expectation, aided by his two sons and a
hired man, he harnessed his three horses to the plow. But one of them, for the first time,
refused to draw. After several fruitless attempts to make the team work as first harnessed,
the relative position of the horses was changed, when, lo! although this horse would draw as
formerly, one of the others would not. By and by another change was made, and the third horse,
in turn, refused to draw. The farmer could not understand it, nor his sons, nor his hired man.
His three horses, for the first time, were each fickle in turn. And, what was most surprising,
they would all work in either of two positions, but in the third none of them would draw. The
honest farmer thought the age of witchcraft had not yet passed. At the conclusion of the forenoon
he gave up the undertaking in disgust, and, carrying the whipple-tree home, told the story
of his unsuccessful and vexatious experiment.

"And how did you harness the horses to the whipple-tree?" inquired the more intelligent farmer.
"Why, one at the short end, and two at the long end, where there is the most room for them,
to be sure!" was the frank reply.

The power at the short end, I need not say, should be twice that at the long end; whereas he
had it reversed. One horse drew against two with a double purchase. He then would have to draw
twice as much as both of them, or four times as much as one of them. The fickleness of the
horses, then, instead of being the result of witchcraft, as he was inclined to believe, was
chargeable solely to the ignorance of their hardly more intelligent master. A knowledge of
the first principles of mechanics, or, in the absence of this, an ordinary degree of active,
available common sense, would teach the proper use of such a whipple-tree. For want of this
knowledge, the farmer suffered much chagrin, lost the time of four men, and did great injury
to his team.

After mentioning this circumstance on a certain occasion, a gentleman present gave a parallel
case, that occurred under his immediate observation. His neighbor had a yoke of oxen, one of
which was large, strong, and beautiful. One day, as the neighbor was passing the residence
of the gentleman, the latter remarked to him, "You have one very fine-looking ox." "Yes," replied
the neighbor, with apparent satisfaction, "and a bonny fellow he is too. He can carry the long
end of the yoke, and grow fat under it." Here, again, the weaker ox had to tax his strength
doubly on account of the advantage which the ignorance of his kind master had unintentionally
given to his superior yoke-fellow.

A farmer, or laborer of any kind, who possesses a knowledge of the merest elements of science,
and is accustomed to think and investigate, can not only work more advantageously with his
team, but he can do more work himself, and do it easier too, than his neighbor of superior
physical strength, though of inferior mental capacity. The correctness of this statement may
be satisfactorily proved and amply illustrated in loading timber, in moving buildings, in plowing,
and in almost every kind of work done on a farm or among men, either on land or at sea. The
ignorant man will spend more time in running after help to do a supposed difficult job, than
it will require for a skillful one to do it alone. This is true in carpentry, and in all of
the mechanic arts. Increase the practical and available education of the laborer, and you enable
him to do more work, and better work too, than his less informed associate. The following is
a striking illustration.

A practical teacher employed some mechanics to build him a barn. The day after the frame was
raised, the teacher discovered that it needed to be turned a few inches upon its foundation,
to range properly with other buildings. While the mechanics went in several directions to procure
what they regarded as necessary help, the teacher, who was familiar with the various combinations
of the lever, effected the work alone, and before their return! Other equally striking illustrations
might be cited.

But education increases the productiveness of labor in a wider and more extended sense. By
its omnipotent influence, man is enabled to lay the elements under tribute. The water and the
wind, by its mysterious power, are made to propel his machinery for various purposes. The utmost
skill of the untutored savage enables him to construct a rude canoe which two can carry upon
their shoulders by land, which is barely capable of plying upon our rivers and coasting our
inland seas, and which can be propelled only by human muscles, but the educated man erects
a magnificent vessel, a floating palace, and, spreading his canvas to the breeze, aided by
the mariner's compass, can traverse unknown seas in safety. To such perfection has he attained
in the science and art of navigation, that he contends successfully with wind and tide, and
makes headway against both, even when he depends upon the former for his motive power. Yes,
education enables man even to tax the gentle breeze to urge a proud ship, heavily laden, up
an inclined plane, thousands of miles, against the current of a mighty river.

I can not, perhaps, so satisfactorily establish the proposition which I am now endeavoring
to elucidate, nor so well maintain the universality of its application, as by referring to
the writings of the most indefatigable and successful laborer in the department of popular
education of which our country can boast. I refer to the Hon. Horace Mann,[39] who, a few years
ago, in his official capacity, opened a correspondence, and availed himself of all opportunities
to hold personal interviews with many of the most practical, sagacious, and intelligent business
men in our country, who for many years had had large numbers of persons in their employment.
His object was to ascertain the difference in the productive ability, where natural capacities
were equal, between the educated and the uneducated; between a man or a woman whose mind has
been awakened to thought, and supplied with the rudiments of knowledge by a good common school
education, and one whose faculties have never been developed, or aided in emerging from their
original darkness and torpor by such a privilege. For this purpose he conferred and corresponded
with manufacturers of all kinds--with machinists, engineers, rail-road contractors, officers
in the army, etc.; classes which have means of determining the effects of education on individuals
equal in their natural abilities that other classes do not possess.

  [39] Late Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education. Reference
  is here especially made to his Fifth Annual Report, bearing date January
  1, 1842, from which, with his consent, what follows under this head has
  been substantially drawn.

A farmer hiring a laborer for one season who has received a good common school education, and
the ensuing season hiring another who has not enjoyed this advantage, although he may be personally
convinced of the relative value or profitableness of their services, yet he will rarely have
any exact data or tests to refer to by which he can measure the superiority of the former over
the latter. They do not work side by side, so that he can institute a comparison between the
amounts of labor they perform. They may cultivate different fields, where the ease of tillage
or the fertility of the soils may be different. They may rear crops under the influence of
different seasons, so that he can not discriminate between what is referable to the bounty
of nature and what to superiority in judgment or skill.

Similar difficulties exist in estimating the amount and value of female labor in the household.
And as to the mechanic also--the carpenter, the mason, the blacksmith, the tool-maker of any
kind--there are a thousand circumstances, which we call accidental, that mingle their influence
in giving quality and durability to their work, and prevent us from making a precise estimate
of the relative value of any two men's handicraft. Individual differences, too, in regard to
a single article or a single days' work, may be too minute to be noticed or appreciated, while
the aggregate of these differences at the end of a few years may make all the difference between
a poor man and a rich one. No observing man can have failed to notice the difference between
two workmen, one of whom, to use a proverbial expression, always "hits the nail on the head,"
while the other loses half his strength and destroys half his nails by the awkwardness of his
blows; but perhaps few men have thought of the difference in the results of two such men's
labor at the end of twenty years.

But when hundreds of men or women work side by side in the same factory, at the same machinery,
in making the same fabrics, and, by a fixed rule of the establishment, labor the same number
of hours each day; and when, also, the products of each operative can be counted in number,
weighed by the pound, or measured by the yard or cubic foot, then it is perfectly practicable
to determine, with arithmetical exactness, the productions of one individual and class as compared
with those of another individual and class.

So, where there are different kinds of labor, some simple, others complicated, and of course
requiring different degrees of intelligence and skill, it is easy to observe what class of
persons rise from a lower to a higher grade of employment.

This, too, is not to be forgotten, that in a manufacturing or mechanical establishment, or
among a set of hands engaged in filling up a valley or cutting down a hill, where scores of
people are working together, the absurd and adventitious distinctions of society do not intrude.
The capitalist and his agents are looking for the greatest amount of labor or the largest income
in money from their investments, and they do not promote a dunce to a station where he will
destroy raw material or slacken industry because of his name, or birth, or family connections.
The obscurest and humblest person has a fair field for competition. That he proves himself
capable of earning more money for his employers is a testimonial better than a diploma from
all the colleges.

Now many of the most intelligent and valuable men in the community, in compliance with Mr.
Mann's request, examined their books for a series of years, and ascertained both the quality
and the amount of work performed by persons in their employment, and the result of the investigation
is a most astonishing superiority in productive power on the part of the educated over the
uneducated laborer. The hand is found to be another hand when guided by an intelligent mind.
Processes are performed not only more rapidly, but better, when faculties which have been exercised
in early life furnish their assistance. Individuals who, without the aid of knowledge, would
have been condemned to perpetual inferiority of condition, and subjected to all the evils of
want and poverty, rise to competence and independence by the uplifting power of education.
In great establishments, and among large bodies of laboring men, where all services are rated
according to their pecuniary value; where there are no extrinsic circumstances to bind a man
down to a fixed position after he has shown a capacity to rise above it; where, indeed, men
pass by each other, ascending or descending in their grades of labor just as easily and certainly
as particles of water of different degrees of temperature glide by each other--under such circumstances
it is found, as an almost invariable fact, other things being equal, that those who have been
blessed with a good common school education rise to a higher and a higher point in the kinds
of labor performed, and also in the rate of wages received, while the ignorant sink like dregs,
and are always found at the bottom.

James K. Mills, Esq., of Boston, who has been connected with a house that has had for the last
ten years the principal direction of cotton-mills, machine shops, and calico-printing works,
in which are constantly employed about three thousand persons, and whose opinions of the effects
of a common school education upon a manufacturing population are the result of personal observation
and inquiries, and are confined to the testimony of the overseers and agents who are brought
into immediate contact with the operatives, expresses the conviction that the rudiments of
a common school education are essential to the attainment of skill and expertness as laborers,
or to consideration and respect in the civil and social relations of life; that very few who
have not enjoyed the advantages of a common school education ever rise above the lowest class
of operatives, and that the labor of this class, when it is employed in manufacturing operations
which require even a very moderate degree of manual or mental dexterity, is unproductive; that
a large majority of the overseers and others employed in situations which require a high degree
of skill in particular branches--which oftentimes require a good general knowledge of business,
and always an unexceptionable moral character--have made their way up from the condition of
common laborers, with no other advantage over a large proportion of those they have left behind
than that derived from a better education.

A statement made from the books of one of the manufacturing companies will show the relative
number of the two classes, and the earnings of each; and this mill, we are assured, may be
taken as a fair index of all the others. The average number of operatives employed for the
last three years is twelve hundred. Of this number there are forty-five unable to write their
names, or about three and three fourths per cent. The average of women's wages, in the departments
requiring the most skill, is two dollars and fifty cents per week, exclusive of board. The
average wages of the lowest departments is one dollar and twenty-five cents per week.

Of the forty-five who are unable to write, twenty-nine, or about two thirds, are employed in
the lowest department. The difference between the wages earned by the forty-five and the average
wages of an equal number of the better-educated class is about twenty-seven per cent. in favor
of the latter. The difference between the wages earned by twenty-nine of the lowest class and
the same number in the higher is sixty-six per cent. Of seventeen persons filling the most
responsible stations in the mills, ten have grown up in the establishment from common laborers
or apprentices.

This statement does not include an importation of sixty-three persons from Manchester, in England,
in 1839. Among these persons there was scarcely one who could read or write; and although a
part of them had been accustomed to work in cotton-mills, yet, either from incapacity or idleness,
they were unable to earn sufficient to pay for their subsistence, and at the expiration of
a few weeks not more than half a dozen remained in the employment of the company.

In some of the print-works a large proportion of the operatives are foreigners. Those who are
employed in the branches which require a considerable degree of skill are as well educated
as our people in similar situations. But the common laborers, as a class, are without any education,
and their average earnings are about two thirds only of those of our lowest classes, although
the prices paid to each are the same for the same amount of work.

Among the men and boys employed in the machine shops, the want of education is quite rare.
Mr. Mills does not know an instance of a person so employed who is unable to read and write;
and many have a good common school education. To this, he thinks, may be attributed the fact
that a large proportion of persons who fill the higher and more responsible situations come
from this class of workmen. From these statements the reader will be able to form some estimate,
in dollars and cents, at least, of the advantages of even a little education to the operative;
and there is not the least doubt, says the same authority, that the employer is equally benefited.
He has the security for his property that intelligence, good morals, and a just appreciation
of the regulations of his establishment always afford. His machinery and mills, which constitute
a large part of his capital, are in the hands of persons who, by their skill, are enabled to
use them to their utmost capacity, and to prevent any unnecessary depreciation.

Each operative in a cotton-mill, according to the estimate of Mr. Mills, may be supposed to
represent from one thousand to twelve hundred dollars of the capital invested in the mill and
its machinery. It is only from the most diligent and economical use of this capital that the
proprietor can expect a profit. A fraction less than one half of the cost of manufacturing
common cotton goods when a mill is in full operation, is made up of charges which are permanent.
If the product is reduced in the ratio of the capacity of the two classes of operatives mentioned
in this statement, it will be seen that the cost will be increased in a compound ratio. Mr.
Mills expresses the opinion "that the best cotton-mill in New England, with such operatives
only as the forty-five mentioned above, who are unable to write their names, would never yield
the proprietor a profit; that the machinery would be soon worn out, and he would be left, in
a short time, with a population no better than that which is represented by the importation
from England. I can not imagine any situation in life," he continues, "where the want of a
common school education would be more severely felt, or be attended with worse consequences,
than in manufacturing villages; nor, on the other hand, is there any where such advantages
can be improved with greater benefit to all parties. There is more excitement and activity
in the minds of people living in masses, and if this expends itself in any of the thousand
vicious indulgences with which they are sure to be tempted, the road to destruction is traveled
over with a speed exactly corresponding to the power employed."

H. Bartlett, Esq., of Lowell, who has been engaged ten years in manufacturing, and has had
the constant charge of from four hundred to nine hundred persons during that time, has come
in contact with a very great variety of character and disposition, and has seen mind applied
to production in the mechanic and manufacturing arts possessing different degrees of intelligence,
from gross ignorance to a high degree of cultivation, and he has no hesitation in affirming
that he finds the best educated to be the most profitable help. Even those females who merely
tend machinery give a result somewhat in proportion to the advantages enjoyed in early life
for education, those who have a good common school education giving, as a class, invariably
a better production than those brought up in ignorance.

In regard to the domestic and social habits of persons in his employ, the same gentleman adds,
"I have never considered mere knowledge, valuable as it is to the laborer, as the only advantage
derived from a good common school education. I have uniformly found the better educated, as
a class, possessing a higher and better state of morals, more orderly and respectful in their
deportment, and more ready to comply with the wholesome and necessary regulations of an establishment.
And in times of agitation, on account of some change in regulations or wages, I have always
looked to the most intelligent, best educated, and the most moral for support, and have seldom
been disappointed; for, while they are the last to submit to imposition, they reason, and if
your requirements are reasonable, they will generally acquiesce, and exert a salutary influence
upon their associates. But the ignorant and uneducated I have generally found the most turbulent
and troublesome, acting under the influence of excited passion and jealousy.

"The former appear to have an interest in sustaining good order, while the latter seem more
reckless of consequences. And, to my mind, all this is perfectly natural. The better educated
have more and stronger attachments binding them to the place where they are. They are generally
neater in their persons, dress, and houses; surrounded with more comforts, with fewer of 'the
ills flesh is heir to.' In short, I have found the educated, as a class, more cheerful and
contented, devoting a portion of their leisure time to reading and intellectual pursuits, more
with their families, and less in scenes of dissipation. The good effect of all this is seen
in the more orderly and comfortable appearance of the whole household, but nowhere more strikingly
than in the children. A mother who has a good common school education will rarely suffer her
children to grow up in ignorance. As I have said, this class of persons are more quiet, more
orderly, and, I may add, more regular in their attendance upon public worship, and more punctual
in the performance of all their duties."

Mr. Bartlett thinks it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for a young man, who has
not an education equal to a good common school education, to rise from grade to grade until
he should obtain the berth of an overseer, and that, in making promotions, as a general thing,
it would be unnecessary to make inquiry as to the education of the young men from whom you
would select. Very seldom indeed, he says, would an uneducated young man rise to "a better
place and better pay. Young men who expect to resort to manufacturing establishments for employment,
can not prize too highly a good education. It will give them standing among their associates,
and be the means of promotion among their employers."

The final remark of this gentleman, in a lengthy letter, showing the advantages of education
in a pecuniary, social, and moral point of view, is, that "those who possess the greatest share
in the stock of worldly goods are deeply interested in this subject, as one of mere insurance;
that the most effectual way of making insurance on their property would be to contribute from
it enough to sustain an efficient system of common school education, thereby educating the
whole mass of mind, and constituting it a police more effectual than peace officers and prisons."
By so doing he thinks they would bestow a benefaction upon those who, from the accident of
birth or parentage, are subjected to the privations and temptations of poverty, and would do
much to remove the prejudice and to strengthen the bands of union between the different and
extreme portions of society. He very justly regards it a wise provision of Providence which
connects so intimately, and, as he thinks, so indissolubly, the greatest good of the many with
the highest interest of the few; or, in other words, which unites into one brotherhood all
the members of the community, and in the existing partnership connects inseparably the interests
of Labor and Capital.[40]

  [40] The New York Free School State Convention, held in Syracuse the
  10th and 11th of July inst. (1850), unanimously adopted an Address to
  the People of the State, written by Horace Greeley, in which the
  following passage occurs, inculcating the same sentiment: "Property is
  deeply interested in the Education of All. There is no farm, no bank, no
  mill, no shop--unless it be a grog-shop--which is not more valuable and
  more profitable to its owner if located among a well-educated than if
  surrounded by an ignorant population. Simply as a matter of interest,
  we hold it to be the duty of Property to itself to provide Education for
  All."

John Clark, Esq., of Lowell, who has had under his superintendence for eight years about fifteen
hundred persons of both sexes, gives concurrent testimony. He has found, with very few exceptions,
the best educated among his hands to be the most capable, intelligent, energetic, industrious,
economical, and moral, and that they produce the best work, and the most of it, with the least
injury to the machinery. They are, in short, in all respects the most useful, profitable, and
the safest operatives; and as a class, they are more thrifty, and more apt to accumulate property
for themselves. "I am very sure," he remarks, "that neither men of property nor society at
large have any thing to fear from a more general diffusion of knowledge, nor from the extension
and improvement of our system of common schools. On our pay-roll for the last month are borne
the names of twelve hundred and twenty-nine female operatives, forty of whom receipted for
their pay by 'making their mark.' Twenty-six of these have been employed in job work; that
is, they are paid according to the quantity of work turned off from their machines. The average
pay of these twenty-six falls eighteen and one half per cent. below the general average of
those engaged in the same departments.

"Again: we have in our mills about one hundred and fifty females who have at some time been
engaged in teaching schools. Many of them teach during the summer months, and work in the mills
in winter. The average wages of these ex-teachers I find to be seventeen and three fourths
per cent. above the general average of our mills, and about forty per cent. above the twenty-six
who can not write their names. It may be said they are generally employed in the higher departments,
where the pay is better. This is true; but this again may be, in most cases, fairly attributed
to their better education, which brings us to the same result. If I had included in my calculations
the remaining fourteen of the forty, who were mostly sweepers and scrubbers, and who are paid
by the day, the contrast would have been still more striking; but, having no well-educated
females in this department with whom to compare them, I have omitted them altogether. In arriving
at the above results, I have considered the net wages merely, the price of board being in all
cases the same. I do not consider these results as either extraordinary or surprising, but
as a part only of the legitimate and proper fruits of a better cultivation, and fuller development
of the intellectual and moral powers."

Mr. Mann gives the entire letters from which I have so freely drawn, and also introduces into
his report extracts from a letter of Jonathan Crane, Esq., who has been for many years a large
rail-road contractor, and has had several thousand men in his employment. The testimony of
this gentleman is corroborative of that already presented. Testimony similar to the preceding
might be introduced from the proprietors and superintendents of the principal manufacturing
establishments in America not only, but from every part of the civilized world. Before concluding
this chapter, I shall, for another purpose, refer to statements made by extensive manufacturers
in England and Switzerland.

These are no more than a fair specimen of a mass of facts which Mr. Mann obtained from the
most authentic sources. They seem to prove incontestably that education is not only a moral
renovator, and a multiplier of intellectual power, but that it is also the most prolific parent
of material riches. It has a right, therefore, not only to be included in the grand inventory
of a nation's resources, but to be placed at the very head of that inventory. It is not only
the most honest and honorable, but the surest means of amassing property. Considering education,
then, as a producer of wealth, it follows that the more educated a people are, the more will
they abound in all those conveniences, comforts, and satisfactions which money will buy; and,
other things being equal, the increase of competency and the decline of pauperism will be measurable
on this scale.

EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE.--The healthful and praiseworthy employment of agriculture requires
knowledge for its successful prosecution. In this department of industry we are in perpetual
contact with the forces of nature. We are constantly dependent upon them for the pecuniary
returns and profits of our investments, and hence the necessity of knowing what those forces
are, and under what circumstances they will operate most efficiently, and will most bountifully
reward our original outlay of money and time.

Our country yields a great variety of agricultural productions, and this brings into requisition
all that chemical and experimental knowledge which pertains to the rotation of crops and the
enrichment of soils. If rotation be disregarded, the repeated demands upon the same soil to
produce the same crop will exhaust it of the elements on which that particular crop will best
thrive. If the chemical ingredients and affinities of the soil are not understood, an attempt
may be made to reenforce it by substances with which it is already surcharged, instead of renovating
it with those of which it has been exhausted by previous growths. But for these arrangements
and adaptations knowledge is the grand desideratum, and the addition of a new fact to a farmer's
mind will often increase the amount of his harvests more than the addition of acres to his estate.

Why is it that, if we except Egypt, all the remaining territory of Africa, containing nearly
ten millions of square miles, with a soil most of which is incomparably more fertile by nature,
produces less for the sustenance of man and beast than England, whose territory is only fifty
thousand square miles? In the latter country, knowledge has been a substitute for a genial
climate and an exuberant soil; while in the former, it is hardly a figurative expression to
say that all the maternal kindness of nature, powerful and benignant as she is, has been repulsed
by the ignorance of her children. Doubtless industry as well as knowledge is indispensable
to productiveness; but knowledge must precede industry, or the latter will work to so little
effect as to become discouraged, and to relapse into the slothfulness of savage life. This
is illustrated by the condition of the inhabitants of Lower California, as described by an
intelligent friend of the author, who left this country a year ago. He says this is a "most
beautiful country, with the finest climate in the world. But its inhabitants, who are principally
Spaniards and Indians, are in a state of semi-barbarism, and consequently its resources are,
to a certain extent, undeveloped. The land, which is generally level and of the richest quality,
is divided into ranchos or plantations, the largest of which are twenty miles square, and feed
twenty or thirty thousand head of wild cattle, with horses and mules in proportion. But these
are all. The arts are in the lowest state imaginable. Their houses are mere pens, without pen
floors; their plows are pointed logs; their yokes are straight sticks, which they tie to the
horns of their oxen; and every implement of industry shows an equal want of ingenuity and enterprise.
They are too indolent to raise much grain, though the soil will yield, I am told, eighty bushels
of wheat to an acre; consequently, wheat is sold to the immigrants at three dollars per bushel,
while the finest beef cattle in the world bring from eight to ten dollars per head. Butter,
cheese, and even milk, you can not obtain at all, for they are too lazy to tame their cows.
A few Americans, who own large ranchos, have American plows, and are doing better than the
rest. Many ranchos have been abandoned, and their owners have gone to the mines. This state
of things the energetic Anglo-Saxon will soon change. The immigration for the next few years
will be immense, and the whole community will yield to American customs. The large ranchos
will be cut up into farms, and their products will supply the wants of a dense population.
Property will rapidly change hands, and it will be easy for the shrewd Yankee to reap the benefit
of the change."

But, without further exposition, it may be remarked generally, that the spread of intelligence,
through the instrumentality of good books, and the cultivation in our children of the faculties
of observing, comparing, and reasoning, through the medium of good schools, would add millions
to the agricultural products of nearly every state of the Union, without imposing upon the
husbandman an additional hour of labor.

EDUCATION AND THE USEFUL ARTS.--For the successful prosecution among us of the manufacturing
and mechanic arts, if not for their very existence, there must be not only the exactness of
science, but also exactness or skill in the application of scientific principles throughout
the whole processes, either of constructing machinery, or of transforming raw materials into
finished fabrics. This ability to make exact and skillful applications of science to an unlimited
variety of materials, and especially to the subtile but most energetic agencies of nature,
is one of the latest attainments of the human mind. It is remarkable that astronomy, sculpture,
painting, poetry, oratory, and even ethical philosophy, had made great progress thousands of
years before the era of the manufacturing and mechanic arts. This era, indeed, has but just
commenced; and already the abundance, and, what is of far greater importance, the universality
of the personal, domestic, and social comforts it has created, constitute one of the most important
epochs in the history of civilization.

The cultivation of these arts is conferring a thousand daily accommodations and pleasures upon
the laborer in his cottage, which, only two or three centuries ago, were luxuries in the palace
of the monarch. Through circumstances incident to the introduction of all economical improvements,
there has hitherto been great inequality in the distribution of their advantages; but their
general tendency is greatly to ameliorate the condition of the mass of mankind. It has been
estimated that the products of machinery in Great Britain, with a population of eighteen millions,
is equal to the labor of hundreds of millions of human hands. This vast gain is effected without
the conquest or partitioning of the territory of any neighboring nation, and without rapine
or the confiscation of property already accumulated by others. It is an absolute creation of
wealth--that is, of those articles, commodities, and improvements which we appraise and set
down as of a certain moneyed value alike in the inventory of a deceased man's estate and in
the grand valuation of a nation's capital. These contributions to human welfare have been derived
from knowledge; from knowing how to employ those natural agencies which from the beginning
of the race had existed, but had lain dormant or run uselessly away. For mechanical purposes,
what is wind, or water, or the force of steam worth, until the ingenuity of man comes in, and
places the wind-wheel, the water-wheel, or the piston between these mighty agents and the work
he wishes them to perform? But after the intervention of machinery, how powerful they become
for all purposes of utility! In a word, these great improvements, which distinguish our age
from all preceding ages, have been obtained from Nature by addressing her in the language of
Science and Art, the only language she understands, yet one of such all-pervading efficacy
that she never refuses to comply to the letter with all petitions for wealth or physical power,
if they are preferred to her in that dialect.

Now it is easy to show, from reasoning, from history, and from experience, that an early awakening
of the mind is a prerequisite to success in the useful arts. But it must be an awakening to
thought, not to feeling merely. In the first place, a clearness of perception must be acquired,
or the power of taking a correct mental transcript, copy, or image of whatever is seen This,
however, though indispensable, is by no means sufficient.

The talent of improving upon the labors of others requires not only the capability of receiving
an exact mental copy or imprint of all the objects of sense or reasoning; it also requires
the power of reviving or reproducing at will all the impressions or ideas before obtained,
and the power of changing their collocations, of re-arranging them into new forms, and of adding
something to or removing something from the original perceptions, in order to make a more perfect
plan or model. If a ship-wright, for instance, would improve upon all existing specimens of
naval architecture, he would first examine as great a number of ships as possible; this done,
he would revive the image which each had imprinted upon his mind, and, with all the fleets
which he had inspected present to his imagination, he would compare each individual vessel
with all others, make a selection of one part from one, and of another part from another, apply
his own knowledge of the laws of moving and of resisting forces to all, and thus create, in
his own mind, the complex idea or model of a ship more perfect than any of those he had seen.

Now every recitation in a school, if rightly conducted, is a step toward the attainment of
this wonderful power. With a course of studies judiciously arranged and diligently pursued
through the years of minority, all the great phenomena of external nature, and the most important
productions in all the useful arts, together with the principles on which they are evolved
or fashioned, would be successively brought before the understanding of the pupil. He would
thus become familiar with the substances of the material world, and with their manifold properties
and uses; and he would learn the laws, comparatively few, by which results infinitely diversified
are produced. When such a student goes out into life, he carries, as it were, a plan or model
of the world in his own mind. He can not, therefore, pass, either blindly or with the stupid
gaze of the brute creation, by the great objects and processes of nature; but he has an intelligent
discernment of their several existences and relations, and their adaptation to the uses of
mankind. Neither can he fasten his eye upon any workmanship or contrivance of man without asking
two questions: first, How is it? and, secondly, How can it be improved?

Hence it is that all the processes of nature and the contrivances of art are so many lessons
or communications to an instructed man; but an uninstructed one walks in the midst of them
like a blind man among colors, or a deaf man among sounds. The Romans carried their aqueducts
from hill-top to hill-top, on lofty arches erected at immense expenditure of time and money.
One idea--that is, a knowledge of the law of the equilibrium of fluids; a knowledge of the
fact that water in a tube will rise to the level of the fountain--would have enabled a single
individual to do with ease what, without that knowledge, it required the wealth of an empire
to accomplish.

It is in ways similar to this--that is, by accomplishing greater results with less means; by
creating products at once cheaper, better, and by more expeditious methods; and by doing a
vast variety of things otherwise impossible--that the cultivation of mind may be truly said
to yield the highest pecuniary requital.

Intelligence is the great money-maker, not by extortion, but by PRODUCTION. There are ten thousand
things in every department of life which, if done in season, can be done in a minute, but which,
if not seasonably done, will require hours, perhaps days or weeks for their performance. An
awakened mind will see and seize the critical juncture; the perceptions of the sluggish one
will come too late, if they come at all.

A general culture of the faculties, also, gives versatility of talent, so that, if the customary
business of the laborer is superseded by improvements, he can readily betake himself to another
kind of employment. But an uncultivated mind is like an automaton, which can do only the thing
for which its wheels or springs were made. Brute force expends itself unproductively. It is
ignorant of the manner in which Nature works, and hence it can not avail itself of her mighty
agencies. Often, indeed, it attempts to oppose Nature. It throws itself across the track where
her resistless car is moving. But knowledge enables its possessor to employ her agencies in
his own service, and he thereby obtains an amount of power, without fee or reward, which thousands
of slaves could not give.

Every man who consumes a single article in whose production or transportation the power of
steam is used, has it delivered to him cheaper than he could otherwise have obtained it. Every
man who can avail himself of this power in traveling, can perform the business of three days
in one, and so far add two hundred per cent. to the length of his life as a business man. What
innumerable millions has the invention of the cotton-gin, by Whitney, added, and will continue
to add, to the wealth of the world! a part of which is already realized, but vastly the greater
part of which is yet to be received, as each successive day draws for an installment which
would exhaust the treasury of a nation. The instructed and talented man enters the rich domains
of Nature not as an intruder, but, as it were, a PROPRIETOR, and makes her riches his own.

Why is it that, so far as the United States are concerned, four fifths of all the improvements,
inventions, and discoveries in regard to machinery, to agricultural implements, to superior
models in ship-building, and to the manufacture of those refined instruments on which accuracy
in scientific observations depends, have originated in New England? I believe no adequate reason
can be assigned but the early awakening and training of the power of thought in her children.
Improvements, inventions, and discoveries have been made in other states of the Union to an
extent commensurate with the progress they have made in perfecting their systems of public
instruction, and these improvements will ever keep pace with the attentions which a people
bestow upon their common schools.

Mr. Mann remarks that, in conversing with a gentleman who had possessed most extensive opportunities
for acquaintance with men of different countries and of all degrees of intellectual development,
he observed that he could employ a common immigrant or a slave, and, if he chose, could direct
him to shovel a heap of sand from one spot to another, and then back into its former place,
and so to and fro through the day; but, added he, neither love nor money would prevail on a
New Englander to prosecute a piece of work of which he did not see the utility.

There is scarcely any kind of labor, however simple, pertaining to the farm, to the work-shop,
or to domestic employments, and whether performed by male or female, which can be so well done
without knowledge in the workman or domestic as with it. It is impossible for an overseer or
employer at all times to supply mind to the laborer. In giving directions for the shortest
series or train of operations, something will be omitted or misunderstood; and without intelligence
in the workman, the omission or mistake will be repeated in the execution.

It is a fact of universal notoriety, that the manufacturing population of England, as a class,
work for half, or less than half the wages of our own. The cost of machinery there, also, is
about half as much as the cost of the same articles with us; while our capital, when loaned,
produces nearly double the rate of English interest; yet against these grand adverse circumstances
our manufacturers, with a small per centage of tariff, successfully compete with English capitalists
in many branches of manufacturing business. No explanation can be given of this extraordinary
fact which does not take into the account the difference of education between the operatives
in the two countries.

One of our most careful and successful manufacturers remarks that, on substituting in one of
his cotton-mills a better for a poorer educated class of operatives, he was enabled to add
twelve or fifteen per cent. to the speed of his machinery, without any increase of damage or
danger from the acceleration. How direct and demonstrative the bearing which facts like this
have upon the wisdom of our laws respecting the education of children in manufacturing establishments.[41]

  [41] In Connecticut the statutes provide "that no child under the age
  of fifteen years shall be employed to labor in any manufacturing
  establishment, or in any other business in the state, unless such child
  shall have attended some public or private day school where instruction
  is given by a teacher qualified to instruct in orthography, reading,
  writing, English grammar, geography, and arithmetic, at least three
  months of the twelve months next preceding any and every year in which
  such child shall be so employed. And the owner, agent, or superintendent
  of any manufacturing establishment who shall employ any child in such
  establishment contrary to the provisions of this act, shall forfeit and
  pay for each offense a penalty of twenty-five dollars to the treasurer
  of the state." In Massachusetts the forfeiture is fifty dollars. Similar
  provisions exist in other American, and in several European states.

The number of females in the State of Massachusetts engaged in the various manufactures of
cotton, straw-platting, etc., has been estimated at forty thousand, and the annual value of
their labor at one hundred dollars each on an average, or four millions of dollars for the
whole. From the facts stated in the letters of Messrs. Mills and Clark above cited, it appears
there is a difference of not less than fifty per cent. between the earnings of the least educated
and of the best educated operatives--between those who make their marks instead of writing
their names, and those who have been acceptably employed in school-keeping. Now suppose the
whole forty thousand females engaged in the various kinds of manufactures in that commonwealth
to be degraded to the level of the lowest class, it would follow that their aggregate earnings
would fall at once to two millions of dollars. But, on the other hand, suppose them all to
be elevated by mental cultivation to the rank of the highest, and their earnings would rise
to the sum of six millions of dollars annually.

There can be no doubt but that education, or the want of it, affects the pecuniary value of
female labor in the ordinary domestic employments of the sex not less than in manufactures.
If, then, the females of the thirty states of the Union be estimated at eight millions--and
the number sustaining the relations of daughters, wives, and mothers must exceed the supposition--the
effect of giving them all an education equal to the best would at once raise their earnings,
annually, two hundred millions of dollars! But this is the lowest sense in which we can estimate
the value of education, even in the sterner sex. This sum, vast as it may seem, is as dross
to gold when compared with the refining and elevating influence which eight millions of educated
females would exert upon the domestic and social institutions of our country, in uplifting
our national character and improving the condition of the race.

Not more than thirty years ago it was uncommon for a glazier's apprentice, even after having
served an apprenticeship of seven years, to be able to cut glass with a diamond without spending
much time and destroying much of the glass upon which he worked. But the invention of a simple
tool has put it into the power of the merest tyro in the trade to cut glass with facility,
and without loss. A man who had a mind, as well as fingers, observed that there was one direction
in which the diamond was almost incapable of abrasion or wearing by use. The tool not only
steadies the diamond, but fastens it in that direction.

The operation of tanning leather consists in exposing a hide to the action of a chemical ingredient,
called tannin, for a length of time sufficient to allow every particle of the hide to become
saturated with the solution. In making the best leather, the hides used to lay in the pit for
six, twelve, or eighteen months, and sometimes for two years, the tanner being obliged to wait
all this time for a return of his capital. By the modern process, the hides are placed in a
close pit, with a solution of the tannin matter, and the air being exhausted, the liquid penetrates
through every pore and fiber of the skin, and the whole process is completed in a few days.

The bleaching of cloth, which used to be effected in the open air, and in exposed situations
where temptation to theft was offered, and in England hundreds and probably thousands of men
have yielded and forfeited their lives, is now performed in an unexposed situation, and in
a manner so expeditious, that cloth is bleached as much more rapidly than it formerly was as
hides are tanned.

It is stated by Lord Brougham, in his beautiful Discourse on the Advantages of Science, that
the inventor of the new mode of refining sugar made more money in a shorter time, and with
less risk and trouble, than perhaps was ever realized from any previous invention.

Intelligence also prevents loss as well as makes profits. How much time and money have been
squandered in repeated attempts to invent machinery, after a principle had been once tested
and had failed through some defect inherent and natural, and therefore insuperable! Within
thirty years not less than five patents have been taken out, in England and the United States,
for a certain construction of paddle-wheels for a steamboat, which construction was tested
and condemned as early as 1810.[42] A case once came within my own knowledge, says Mr. Mann,
of a person who spent a fortune in mining for coal, when a work on geology, which would have
cost but a dollar, and might have been read in a week, would have informed him that the stratum
where he began to excavate belonged to a formation lower down in the natural series than coal
ever is, or, according to the constitution of things, ever can be found. He therefore worked
into a stratum which must have been formed before a particle of coal, or even a tree, or a
vegetable existed on the planet. Numerous similar and equally striking illustrations might
be cited, but this is not necessary.

  [42] This statement was made eight years ago. More such patents may have
  been taken out within this time.

These are a few specimens, on familiar subjects, taken almost at random, for the purpose of
showing the inherent superiority of any association or community, whether small or great, where
mind is a member of the partnership. What is true of the above-mentioned cases is true of the
whole circle of those arts by which human life is sustained and human existence comforted,
elevated, and embellished. Mind has been the improver, for matter can not improve itself, and
improvement has advanced in proportion to the number and culture of the minds excited to activity
and applied to the work.

Similar advancements have been effected throughout the whole compass of human labor and research;
in the arts of Transportation and Locomotion, from the employment of the sheep and the goat
as beasts of burden, to the steam-engine and the rail-road car; in the art of Navigation, from
the canoe clinging timidly to the shore, to steam-ships which boldly traverse the ocean; in
Hydraulics, from carrying water by hand in a vessel or in horizontal aqueducts, to those vast
conduits which supply the demands of a city, and to steam fire-engines which throw a column
of water to the top of the loftiest buildings; in the arts of Spinning and Rope-making, from
the hand distaff to the spinning-frame, and to the machine which makes cordage or cables of
any length, in a space ten feet square; in Horology or Time-keeping, from the sun-dial and
the water-clock to the watch, and to the chronometer, by which the mariner is assisted in measuring
his longitude, and in saving property and life; in the extraction, forging, and tempering of
Iron and other ores having malleability to be wrought into all forms and used for all purposes,
and supplying, instead of the stone hatchet or the fish-shell of the savage, an almost infinite
variety of instruments, which have sharpness for cutting or solidity for striking; in the art
of Vitrification or Glass-making, giving not only a multitude of commodious and ornamental
utensils for the household, but substituting the window for the unsightly orifice or open casement,
and winnowing light and warmth from the outward and the cold atmosphere; in the arts of Induration
by Heat, from bricks dried in the sun to those which withstand the corrosion of our climate
for centuries or resist the intensity of the furnace; in the arts of Illumination, from the
torch cut from the fir or pine tree to the brilliant gas-light which gives almost a solar splendor
to the nocturnal darkness of our cities; in the arts of Heating and Ventilation, which at once
supply warmth for comfort and pure air for health; in the art of Building, from the hollowed
trunk of a tree or the roof-shaped cabin, to those commodious and lightsome dwellings which
betoken the taste and competence of our villages and cities; in the art of Copying or Printing,
from the toilsome process of hand-copying, where the transcription of a single book was the
labor of months or years, and sometimes almost of a life, to the power printing-press, which
throws off sixty printed sheets in a minute; in the art of Paper-making, from the preparation
of the inner bark of a tree, cleft off and dried at immense labor, to machinery from which
there jets out an unbroken stream of paper with the velocity and continuousness of a current
of water; in the art of Painting, from the use of the crayon, and artificial colors imperfectly
blended, requiring whole days to present an incomplete picture, to the production, as by enchantment,
of perfect likenesses in nature's own penciling, executed in a few seconds; in the art of Telegraphing,
from communicating information by signs which may be seen from one station to another, to conveying
intelligence to any given distance with the velocity of lightning; and, in addition to all
these, in the arts of Moulding and Casting, of Designing and Engraving, of Preserving materials
and of Changing their color, of Dividing and Uniting them, etc., etc., an ample catalogue,
whose very names and processes would fill volumes.

Now, for the perfecting of all these operations, from the tedious and bungling process to the
rapid and elegant; for the change of an almost infinite variety of crude and worthless materials
into useful and beautiful fabrics, mind has been the agent. Succeeding generations have outstripped
their predecessors just in proportion to the superiority of their mental cultivation. When
we compare different people or different generations with each other, the diversity is so great
that all must behold it. But there is the same kind of difference between contemporaries, fellow-townsmen,
and fellow-laborers. Though the uninstructed man works side by side with the intelligent, yet
the mental difference between them places them in the same relation to each other that a past
age bears to the present. If the ignorant man knows no more respecting any particular art or
branch of business than was generally known during the last century, he belongs to the last
century, and he must consent to be outstripped by those who have the light and knowledge of
the present. Though they are engaged in the same kind of work, though they are supplied with
the same tools or implements for carrying it on, yet, so long as one has only an arm, but the
other has an arm and a MIND, their products will come out stamped and labeled all over with
marks of contrast; inferiority and superiority, both as to quantity and quality, will be legibly
written on their respective labors.

It is related by travelers among savage tribes that when, by the aid of an ingeniously devised
instrument or apparatus, they have performed some skillful manual operation, the savages have
purloined from them the instrument they had used, supposing there was some magic in the apparatus
itself, by which the seeming miracle had been performed; but, as they could not steal the art
of the operator with the instrument which he employed, the theft was fruitless. Any person
who expects to effect with less education what another is enabled to do with more, ought not
to smile at the delusion of the savage or the simplicity of his reasoning.

On a cursory inspection of the great works of art--the steam-engine, the printing-press, the
power-loom, the mill, the iron foundery, the ship, the telescope, etc., etc.--we are apt to
look upon them as having sprung into sudden existence, and reached their present state of perfection
by one, or, at most, by a few mighty efforts of creative genius. We do not reflect that they
have required the lapse of centuries and the successive application of thousands of minds for
the attainment of their present excellence; that they have advanced from a less to a more perfect
form by steps and gradations almost as imperceptible as the growth by which an infant expands
to the stature of a man; and that, as later discoverers and inventors had first to go over
the ground of their predecessors, so must future discoverers and inventors first master the
attainments of the present age before they will be prepared to make those new achievements
which are to carry still further onward the stupendous work of improvement.

EDUCATION DIMINISHES PAUPERISM AND CRIME.

    Education is to be regarded as one of the most important means of
    eradicating the germs of pauperism from the rising generation, and
    of securing in the minds and in the morals of the people the best
    protection for the institutions of society.--DR. JAMES PHILLIPS KAY,
    Assistant Poor-Law Commissioner, and Secretary to the Committee of
    Council on Education.[43]

    The different countries of the world, if arranged according to the
    state of education in them, will be found to be arranged also
    according to WEALTH, MORALS, and GENERAL HAPPINESS; at the same
    time, THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE, AND THE EXTENT OF CRIME AND
    VIOLENCE AMONG THEM, FOLLOW A LIKE ORDER.--NATIONAL EDUCATION, by
    Fred. Hill, London.

That education increases the productiveness of labor has been already conclusively established.
If, then, poverty is at once a cause and an effect of crime, as is stated by a late writer,[44]
who has made an extended survey of the relative state of instruction and social welfare in
the leading nations of the world, it is directly inferable that education will, and, from the
nature of the case, must act in a compound ratio in diminishing both pauperism and crime.

  [43] Quoted from the Report to the Secretary of State for the Home
  Department, on the Training of Pauper Children, London, 1841.

  [44] Fred. Hill, author of National Education, whose testimony is quoted
  at the head of this article.

This proposition is not received by a few individuals merely in comparatively unimportant communities:
it is one which is generally adopted by enlightened practical educators and by liberal-minded
capitalists of both hemispheres. The views of several of our principal American manufacturers
have been already presented. Let us now direct our attention to the testimony of enlightened
and liberal-minded capitalists residing in some of the transatlantic states.

William Fairbrain, Esq., the sole proprietor of a manufactory in Manchester, and part owner
of another establishment in London, and who has between eleven and twelve hundred persons in
his employ, remarks in relation to the habits of the educated and uneducated as follows: There
is no doubt that the educated are more sober and less dissipated than the uneducated. During
the hours of recreation, the younger portion of the educated workmen indulge more in reading
and mental pleasures; they attend more at reading-rooms, and avail themselves of the facilities
afforded by libraries, by scientific lectures, and by lyceums. The older of the more educated
workmen spend their time chiefly with their families, reading and walking out with them. The
time of the uneducated classes is spent very differently, and chiefly in the grosser sensual
indulgences. Mr. Fairbrain has given his own time as president of a lyceum for the use of the
working classes, which furnishes the means of instruction in arithmetic, mathematics, drawing,
and mensuration, and by lectures. In these institutions liberal provision is very properly
made, not only for the occupation of the leisure hours of the laborers themselves, and for
their intellectual and social improvement, but for that of their wives and families, in order
"to make the home comfortable, and to minister to the household recreation and amusement: this
is a point of view in which the education of the wives of laboring men is really of very great
importance, that they may be rational companions for men."[45]

  [45] See evidence taken by Edwin Chadwick, Esq., Secretary to the
  Poor-Law Commissioners, a quotation from whose report heads this
  article.

Albert G. Escher, Esq., one of the firm of Escher, Wyss, and Co., of Zurich, Switzerland, remarks
as follows: We employ from six to eight hundred men in our machine-making establishment at
Zurich: we also employ about two hundred men in our cotton-mills there, and about five hundred
men in our cotton manufactories in the Tyrol and in Italy. I have occasionally had the control
of from five to six hundred men engaged in engineering operations as builders, masons, etc.,
and men of the class called navigators in England.

After giving a list of the different countries from which his laborers are drawn, classifying
the workmen of various nations "in respect to such natural intelligence as may be distinguished
from any intelligence imparted by the labors of the schoolmaster," and remarking in relation
to the influence of education upon the value of labor--where his testimony corroborates that
of manufacturers in New England, already quoted--the same gentleman makes a statement which
is applicable to the subject under consideration.

"The better educated workmen, we find, are distinguished by superior moral habits in every
respect. In the first place, they are entirely sober; they are discreet in their enjoyments,
which are of a more rational and refined kind; they are more refined themselves, and they have
a taste for much better society, which they approach respectfully, and consequently find much
readier admittance to it; they cultivate music; they read; they enjoy the pleasures of scenery,
and make parties for excursions into the country; they are economical, and their economy extends
beyond their own purse to the stock of their master; they are consequently honest and trustworthy."

Scotland affords a very striking illustration of the power of education in diminishing pauperism
and crime, and in improving the morals and increasing the wealth of a country. Indeed, it would
be difficult to find another instance in the history of nations of a country which has made
such rapid progress in the diminution of crime, the increase of public wealth, and the diffusion
of comforts, as Scotland. And this gratifying change--this remarkable instance of progress
in the scale of being, has been concurrent with increased and increasing attention to the education
of the people.

At the beginning of the last century, Scotland swarmed with gipsies and other vagabonds, who
lived chiefly by stealing, and who often committed violent robberies and murders. Of these
pests to society it was estimated that there were not less than two hundred thousand. Besides
these, there were the more gentlemanly, though less tolerable robbers, such as the notorious
Rob Roy, who made no more ado about seizing another man's cattle than a grazier does of driving
from market a drove of oxen for which he has paid every shilling demanded.

But now, the laying aside of a sum sufficient for the education of his children is an object
which a Scotchman seldom loses sight of, both when he thinks of marrying and settling in life,
and at every future period; and it is to this habit, handed down from father to son, that the
Scotch owe their morality. One of their own writers says, "we have scarcely any rural population
who are not perfectly aware of the importance of education, and not willing to make sacrifices
to secure it to their children."

Having seen something of the excellence of education in improving the social and moral habits
of a community, and in banishing pauperism and crime from among those who become the happy
subjects of its uplifting power, let us, for the purpose of becoming more alive to its importance,
consider the condition of a people where the masses are not brought under its benign influence.

Spain, which has been already referred to in illustration of the evils of ignorance, affords
a striking illustration for our present purpose. Until after the lapse of one third of the
present century, there was but ONE newspaper published in this country! "Yes, one miserable
government gazette was the sole channel through which twelve or fourteen millions of people,
spread over a vast territory, were to be supplied with information on the momentous affairs
of their own country, and of the whole external world."--National Education, vol. ii., p. 136.

"The most authentic return of the number of children receiving education
in Spain was made in the year 1803, and it is believed that but little
change has taken place since that time. According to the returns, the
number of children receiving education, exclusive of those brought up in
convents and monasteries, was only one in every three hundred and
forty-six of the population! M. Jonnés estimates the population at about
fourteen millions and a half, and assuming, as he does, that about the
same fraction of the population is receiving education as in 1803, he
estimates the present number of children in school in the whole of Spain
at not more than about forty-three thousand; and, pursuing his
calculations, he shows that, if his data be correct, not more than one
child in thirty-five ever goes to school. He further states that the
children thus favored are exclusively from the middle and upper
classes."[46]--National Education, vol. ii., p. 130-1. Some ideas, not connected with the subject in hand, are
  omitted, but none are changed.

How far the education given to the favored few is of a practical and useful kind, may be conjectured
from the following extract from M. Jonnés's work. After speaking of the many libraries, schools,
colleges, and universities, the creation of past times, but which still exist, he remarks,
that "these institutions were intended for a state of society which had nothing in common with
that of the present day. The kind of instruction afforded in them, confined as it is to prayer,
church discipline, and the dogmas of theology, has no connection with the interests and wants
of the existing generation.

"What every enlightened man in Spain has long called for is a national, popular, gratuitous
education, extending to all classes, as well in the towns as in the rural districts. Up to
the present time, the people have received no other instruction than that offered by the clergy,
which has had scarcely any other object than the performance of religious ceremonies."

In addition to what has been already stated, it may be remarked, that even with those who know
how to read, "books and study are almost out of the question, because, unless in the principal
cities, public libraries are nowhere to be found, and private libraries are luxuries that few
possess."

If education is conducive to virtue, and ignorance fosters crime, what must be the social and
moral state of a country in which ignorance is so prevalent! "The amount of crime in Spain
is appalling. We have before us a return of convictions for the year 1826, from which we shall
make some extracts. Our reason for taking this year is simply because we are unable to procure
any return for a later one. The number of convictions for murder in England and Wales in the
year 1826 was thirteen, and the number convicted of wounding, etc., with intent to kill, was
fourteen. These numbers are lamentably large. That the horrible crime of murder should ever
be perpetrated is a most melancholy fact; and that so many as thirteen murders should be committed
in one year must fill the mind of every moral man and lover of his country with grief and shame.
But great as this number is absolutely, it sinks into insignificance when compared with the
number of murders perpetrated in Spain; for in that unhappy country, in the single year of
1826, the number of convictions for murder reached the frightful height of TWELVE HUNDRED AND
THIRTY-THREE! in addition to which, there were seventeen hundred and seventy-three convictions
on charges of maiming with intent to kill, and sixteen hundred and twenty persons were convicted
of robbery under aggravated circumstances. We doubt not for an instant THIS MASS OF CRIME IS
THE OFFSPRING OF IGNORANCE."--National Education, vol. ii., p. 144.

It has been well remarked that the truest proofs of a good government are just laws, and that
the best evidence of a well-organized government is to be found in the strict execution of
these laws. "Judging the Spanish government by these tests, it will appear the worst and weakest
government that ever held together. Justice of no kind has any existence; there is the most
lamentable insecurity of person and property; redress is never certain, because both judgment
and the execution of the laws are left to men so inadequately paid that they must depend for
their subsistence upon bribery. Nothing is so difficult as to bring a man to trial who has
any thing in his purse, except to bring him to execution: this, unless in Madrid and Catalonia,
is impossible, for money will always buy indemnity.

"I can state, upon certain information received in Madrid, that the principal Spanish diligences
pay black mail to the banditti for their protection. This arrangement was at first entered
into with some difficulty; and from a gentleman who was present at the interview between the
person employed to negotiate on behalf of the diligences and the representative of the banditti,
I learned a few particulars. The diligences in question were those between Madrid and Seville,
and the sum offered for their protection was not objected to, but another difficulty was started.
'I have nothing to say against the terms you offer,' said the negotiator for the banditti,
'and I will at once insure you against being molested by robbers of consequence! but as for
the small fry, I can not be responsible! we respect the engagements entered into by each other,
but there is nothing like honor among the petty thieves.' The proprietors of the diligences,
however, were satisfied with the assurance of protection against the great robbers, and the
treaty was concluded; but not long afterward one of the coaches was stopped and rifled by the
petty thieves: this led to an arrangement which has ever since proved effectual; one of the
chiefs accompanies the coach on its journey, and overawes, by his name and reputation, the
robbers of inferior degree."--Spain in 1830, vol. i., p. 2.

A volume might be filled with similar testimony, showing the great insecurity of person and
property in various parts of this unhappy country. Even "a woman who dares prosecute the murderer
of her husband speedily receives a private intimation that effectually silences her; and it
has not been uncommon for money to be put into the hands of an escrivano[47] previous to the
commission of a murder, in order to insure the services and protection of a person so necessary
to one who meditates crime."

  [47] The escrivanos, who figure so largely in Spain, are the
  representatives of the lowest class of attorneys. Nothing can be done
  without them, and they are not unfrequently almost the sole authority in
  a place capable of reading and writing. Notwithstanding the miserable
  state of the rural districts, they contrive to make money, and many of
  them rise from this humble office to much higher places in the state.
  Their wretched appointments are, consequently, objects of competition. I
  witnessed the execution of one at Seville by accidentally entering the
  Plaza, where the Capuchins were bawling out the last words for his
  repetition, announcing to the crowd that they had done their duty, and
  he died in the true faith. He had been superseded in some village in the
  vicinity, and assassinated his rival.--Cook's Sketches in Spain, vol.
  i., p. 197.

Spain abounds in poverty. Ignorance conduces to crime, which, as we have seen, is at once a
cause and an effect of poverty. In view of what has already been said of the ignorance and
immorality of the Spaniards, one would readily enough infer that poverty exists among them
to a deplorable extent, and it is even so. In this country "every thing, indeed, appears to
have conspired to paralyze industry, and to render of no avail the natural fertility of the
soil. The havoc of war; the plunder committed by organized and powerful bodies of robbers;
the rapacity of government and of its army of officers; the exclusion of foreign goods, and
the consequent shutting up of the foreign market; the ignorance of the people as to the best
modes of agriculture; and, last of all, the want of capital--all these combine to produce squalid
poverty in a land which ought to," and, with a good system of popular education, most assuredly
would, "ABOUND IN WEALTH."

Scotland and Spain have been referred to, not to bring out a few facts in history merely, but
to illustrate an important truth. Where a good system of popular education is well administered
in a country, and, as a consequence, intelligence, industry, and morality become universal
among its citizens, they will eventually become a wealthy, and a highly-prosperous and happy
community, even though they derive their subsistence from a naturally unfruitful soil; but,
on the contrary, where popular education is neglected in a commonwealth, and its future citizens,
as a consequence, grow up in ignorance, idleness, and vice, squalid poverty and flagrant crime
will become prevalent throughout a wretched and degenerate community, that is scarcely able
to gain a mere subsistence from a naturally productive soil.

In further confirmation of the truth of the proposition that education diminishes crime, I
will introduce the following statistics, gleaned from various official documents respecting
prisons. According to returns to the British Parliament, the commitments for crimes in an average
of nine years in proportion to population are as follows: In Manchester, the most infidel city
in the nation, 1 in 140; in London, 1 in 800; in all Ireland, 1 in 1600; and in Scotland, celebrated
for learning and religion, 1 in 20,000!

The Rev. Dr. Forde, for many years the Ordinate of Newgate, London, represents ignorance as
the first great cause, and idleness as the second, of all the crimes committed by the inmates
of that celebrated prison. Sir Richard Phillips, sheriff of London, says that, on the memorial
addressed to the sheriffs by 152 criminals in the same institution, 25 only signed their names
in a fair hand, 26 in an illegible scrawl, and that 101, two thirds of the entire number, were
marksmen, signing with a cross. Few of the prisoners could read with facility; more than half
of them could not read at all; the most of them thought books were useless, and were totally
ignorant of the nature, object, and end of religion.

The Rev. Mr. Clay, chaplain to the House of Correction in Lancashire, represents that out of
1129 persons committed, 554 could not read; 222 were barely capable of reading; 38 only could
read well; and only 8, or 1 in 141, could read and write well. One half of the 1129 prisoners
were quite ignorant of the simplest truths; 37 of these, 1 in 20 of the entire number, were
occasional readers of the Bible; and only one out of this large number was familiar with the
Holy Scriptures and conversant with the principles of religion. Among the 516 represented as
entirely ignorant, 125 were incapable of repeating the Lord's Prayer.

In the New York State Prisons, as examined a few years ago, more than three fourths of the
convicts had either received no education or a very imperfect one. Out of 842 at Sing Sing,
289 could not read or write, and only 42--less than 1 in 20--had received a good common school
education. Auburn prison presents similar statistics. Out of 228 prisoners, only 59 could read,
write, and cipher, and 60 could do neither.

The chaplain of the Ohio penitentiary remarks that not only in the prison of that state, but
in others, depraved appetites and corrupt habits, which have led to the commission of crime,
are usually found with the ignorant, uninformed, and duller part of mankind. Of 276 at one
time in that institution, nearly all were below mediocrity, and 175 are represented as grossly
ignorant, and, in point of education, scarcely capable of transacting the ordinary business
of life.

The preceding, it is believed, is no more than a fair specimen of the criminal statistics of
this country and of the civilized world. I will conclude this dark catalogue by introducing
a statement in relation to education and crime in a state which, according to the last general
census, contained fewer persons in proportion to the whole population who were unable to read
and write than any other state in the Union. From this statement it appears that as a people
become more generally intelligent and moral, a greater proportion of their criminals will be
found among the ignorant and neglected classes.

The chaplain of the Connecticut State Prison states that, out of 190 prisoners, not one was
liberally educated, or a member of either of the learned professions. Of the whole number,
109 were natives of Connecticut; and of these, many of them could not understand the plainest
sentences which they read, and their moral culture had been more neglected than their intellectual.
From the investigations of this officer, it appears that out of every 100 prisoners only two
could be found who could read, write, and were temperate, and only four who could read, write,
and followed any regular trade.

I might appropriately add under this head that a proper attention to the subject of education
would greatly diminish the number of fatal accidents; that it would save many lives, prevent
much of idiocy and insanity, and a multitude of evils that ordinarily result from ignorance
of the organic laws.

FATAL ACCIDENTS.--He who understands the laws of motion knows that a man jumping from a carriage
at speed is in great danger of falling after his feet reach the ground, for his body has the
same forward velocity as if he had been running with the speed of the carriage, and unless
he continues to advance his feet as in running to support his advancing body, he must as certainly
be dashed to the ground as a runner whose feet are suddenly arrested. If, then, there is danger
in leaping from a carriage in motion, how much greater is the hazard in jumping from a rail-road
car under full headway. And yet many do this, jumping off side-wise, so that it is impossible
to advance; and some even jump in the opposite direction from the motion of the car, which
increases the already imminent hazard. From statistics recently collected, it appears that
the great majority of accidents on the rail-roads of this country have happened in this way,
a want of practical conformity to this one law of motion being the prevailing cause of fatality
along these thoroughfares. This is but a specimen of the fatal accidents that are continually
occurring in the every-day transactions of life, which might be prevented as easily as this
by the practical application of a single scientific principle.

LOSS OF LIFE.--In a single hospital at Dublin, during four years, 2944 children out of 7650,
about 40 in 100, died within a fortnight after their birth. Dr. Clark, the attending physician,
suspecting a want of pure air to be the cause, provided for the ventilation of all the apartments;
and by means of pipes six inches in diameter, introduced into every room a current of fresh,
pure air, which is essential to vitality, and allowed that which was vitiated by respiration
to escape. The consequence was, that during the three succeeding years only 165 out of 4243
children died within the first two weeks, or less than 4 in 100. As there was no other known
cause of improvement in the health of these children, it may be justly inferred that, during
the four years first mentioned, 2650 children, nine tenths of the whole number, had perished
for want of pure air.

It has been estimated that about 40 in every 100 of the deaths annually occurring in Great
Britain and the United States are of children under five years of age. To avoid every possibility
of exaggeration, we will place the number in this country at 30 in 100. At this rate we lose
about 200,000 children under five years of age every year. Now, if nine tenths of the mortality
among infants in the Dublin Hospital were caused by breathing bad air, we may reasonably infer
that at least one half of the deaths in the United States of children under the age of five
years proceed from the same fatal cause. And those who have noticed what pains are taken by
excessively careful mothers[48] and ignorant nurses to exclude from the lungs of infants the
"free, pure, unadulterated air of heaven," and, by means of many thicknesses of enveloping
shawls and blankets, require them to re-respire portions at least of their own breath, until
it becomes a virulent and deadly poison, will think with me that this is a low estimate, and
wonder that the swaddling-cloths of more infants do not become their winding-sheets. But, even
according to this estimate, 100,000 children in the United States annually fall victims to
the ignorance of their fond mothers. Many thousands more are subsequently sacrificed in consequence
of occupying small and unventilated bed-rooms and school-rooms, which, by a practical knowledge
of the principles of physiology, might be saved. Perhaps as many more become sufferers for
life from the same cause, for a thousand forms of disease, as it manifests itself in every
stage of life, either owe their existence or their severity to breathing bad air. These, then,
who drag out a miserable existence in consequence of this cruel treatment, are to be more pitied
than those who fall its ready victims.

  [48] It would seem that the great majority of "educated mothers" do not
  realize the necessity of supplying pure air to the new-born child.
  Before birth, the blood of the fetus is purified in the maternal lungs;
  after birth, in the lungs of the child, if at all; and for this purpose
  pure air is necessary.

If so many thousand deaths occur annually in the United States from this one cause, in addition
to the vast amount of misery which is entailed upon the wretched survivors, how many hundred
thousand precious lives might be saved, and what untold wretchedness might be prevented, by
a strict conformity to those physiological laws of our being which might and should be generally
taught in the common schools of the land.

EDUCATION AND IDIOCY.[49]--The education of idiots has hitherto been regarded as paradoxical,
and still is by the mass of mankind; but that it is possible to improve the condition of this
most wretched and helpless class of persons none need longer doubt. The experiment has succeeded
in both Europe and America. Massachusetts has the honor of taking the lead in this country;
and it is meet that it should be so, for she has long, like a wise parent, been accustomed
to care for all her children. She had most readily and generously seconded the efforts of humane
men for the relief of the insane, the deaf mutes, and the blind, and made provision for their
care and instruction. She extended her maternal love to the bodies of those who were in hopeless
idiocy, but as for minds, they seemed to have none; they were, therefore, kept out of sight
of the public as much as possible until the year 1846, when a board of commissioners were appointed
"to inquire into the condition of the idiots of the commonwealth, to ascertain their number,
and whether any thing can be done in their behalf."

  [49] The statements under this head are drawn from Dr. Howe's Report on
  Idiocy, made in February last, and communicated by the governor to the
  Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The author visited the
  Institution in South Boston during the past summer, and derived much
  information on the subject from personal observation and inquiry.

In their report the commissioners say that, "by diligent and careful inquiries in nearly one
hundred towns in different parts of the state, we have ascertained the existence and examined
the condition of five hundred and seventy-five human beings who are condemned to hopeless idiocy,
who are considered and treated as idiots by their neighbors, and left to their own brutishness.
They are also idiotic in a legal sense; that is, they are regarded as incapable of entering
into contracts, and are irresponsible for their actions."

The commissioners conclude that, "if the other parts of the state contain the same proportion
of idiots to their whole population, the total number in the commonwealth is between fourteen
and fifteen hundred!" Now if we make the same estimate in proportion to the entire population,
it will appear that in the United States there are upward of thirty-five thousand persons in
the most wretched and helpless condition of idiocy.

In view of the great number of idiots in the commonwealth, the commissioners say, "it appeared
to us certain that the existence of so many idiots in every generation must be the consequence
of some violation of the natural laws; that where there was so much suffering there must have
been sin. We resolved, therefore, to seek for the sources of the evil, as well as to gauge
the depth and extent of the misery."

Some of the causes of idiocy are set forth in the report, two of which are as follows: first,
the low condition of the physical organization of one or both parents, induced often by intemperance;
second, the intermarriage of relatives.

The report states that out of 420 cases of congenital idiocy which were examined, some information
was gained respecting the condition of the progenitors of 359. Now in all these cases, save
only four, it was found that one or the other, or both, of the immediate progenitors of the
unfortunate sufferer had in some way widely departed from the normal condition of health, and
violated the natural laws. That is to say, one or the other, or both of them, had been very
unhealthy or scrofulous; or hereditarily predisposed to affections of the brain, causing occasional
insanity; or had intermarried with blood relatives; or had been intemperate; or had been guilty
of sensual excesses which impair the constitution.[50]

  [50] The subject of hereditary transmission of diseased tendency is of
  vast importance, but it is a difficult one to treat, because a squeamish
  delicacy makes people avoid it; but if ever the race is to be relieved
  of a tithe of the bodily ills which flesh is now heir to, it must be by
  a clear understanding of, and a willing obedience to, the law which
  makes the parents the blessing or the curse of the children; the givers
  of strength, and vigor, and beauty, or the dispensers of debility, and
  disease, and deformity. It is by the lever of enlightened parental love,
  more than by any other power, that mankind is to be raised to the
  highest attainable point of bodily perfection.--DR. S. G. HOWE.

INTEMPERANCE AND IDIOCY.--Out of the three hundred and fifty-nine idiots, the condition of
whose progenitors was ascertained, ninety-nine were the children of drunkards. But this does
not tell the whole story by any means. By drunkard is meant a person who is a notorious and
habitual sot. Many persons who are habitually intemperate do not get this name even now; much
less would they have done so twenty-five or thirty years ago. By a pretty careful inquiry,
with an especial view of ascertaining the number of idiots of the lowest class whose parents
were known to be temperate persons, it is found that not one quarter can be so considered.

From the pretty uniform action of a physiological law, which is now becoming well understood,
it appears that idiots, fools, and simpletons, either in the first or second generation, are
common among the progeny of intemperate persons, and may be considered as an effect of the
habitual use of alcohol, even in moderate quantities. If, moreover, one considers how many
children of intemperate parents there are who, without being idiots, are deficient in bodily
and mental energy, and predisposed by their very organization to have cravings for alcoholic
stimulants, it will be seen what an immense burden the drinkers of one generation throw upon
the succeeding one.

IDIOCY AND THE MARRIAGE OF RELATIVES.--Out of the three hundred and fifty-nine cases of congenital
idiocy already referred to, in which the parentage was ascertained, "seventeen were known to
be the children of parents nearly related by blood; but, as many of these cases were adults,
it was impossible to ascertain, in some cases, whether their parents, who were dead, were related
or not before marriage. From some collateral evidence, we conclude that at least three more
cases should be added to the seventeen. This would show that more than one twentieth of the
idiots examined are offspring of the marriage of relations. Now, as marriages between near
relations are by no means in the ratio of one to twenty, nor even, perhaps, as one to a thousand
to the marriages between persons not related, it follows that the proportion of idiotic progeny
is vastly greater in the former than in the latter case. Then it should be considered that
idiocy is only one form in which Nature manifests that she has been offended by such intermarriages.
It is probable that blindness, deafness, imbecility, and other infirmities, are more likely
to be the lot of the children of parents related by blood than of others. The probability,
therefore, of unhealthy or infirm issue from such marriages becomes fearfully great, and the
existence of the law against them is made out as clearly as though it were written on tables
of stone.

"The statistics of the seventeen families, the heads of which, being blood relatives, intermarried,
tells a fearful tale. Most of the parents were intemperate or scrofulous; some were both the
one and the other; of course, there were other causes to increase chances of infirm offspring
besides that of the intermarriage. There were born unto them ninety-five children, of whom
forty-four were idiotic, twelve others were scrofulous and puny, one was deaf, and one was
a dwarf! In some cases, all the children were either idiotic, or very scrofulous and puny.
In one family of eight children, five were idiotic."

CONDITION OF IDIOTS.--From what has been said of the character of parents to whom are born
the greatest proportion of this most wretched and helpless class of persons, their condition
and treatment might be inferred. To rear healthy children properly, a knowledge of the principles
of physiology and mental science is essentially necessary. This knowledge is still more important
in the treatment of idiots. Dr. Howe is of the opinion that it requires a rarer and higher
kind of talent to teach an idiot than a youth of superior talent. When the time comes that
schools for idiots are established all over the country, he thinks "it will be found more difficult
to get good teachers for them than to get good professors for our colleges."

After excepting five or six alms-houses in which the idiots are treated both kindly and wisely,
the commissioners say, "the general condition of those at the public charge is most deplorable.
They are filthy, gluttonous, lazy, and given up to abominations of various kinds. They not
only do not improve, but they sink deeper and deeper into bodily depravity and mental degradation.
Bad, however, as is the condition of the idiots who are at public charge, and gross as is the
ignorance of those who take the charge of them about their real wants and capabilities, we
are constrained to say that the condition of those in private houses is, generally speaking,
still worse, and the ignorance of the relatives and friends who support them is still more
profound."

This is not to be wondered at when we consider that idiots are generally born of a very poor
stock--of persons who are subject to some disorders of the brain, or who are themselves scrofulous
and puny to the last degree. Such persons are, generally, very feeble in intellect, poor in
purse, and intemperate in habits. A great many of them are hardly able to take care of themselves.
They are unfit to teach or train common children; how much less to take the charge of idiots,
whose education is the most difficult of all!

The commissioners ascertained, mainly by personal observation, the condition of three hundred
and fifty-five idiotic persons who are not town or state paupers. Of these there may be, at
the most, five who are treated very judiciously; who are taught by wise and discreet persons,
and whose faculties and capabilities are developed to their fullest extent; but the remaining
three hundred and fifty are generally "in a most deplorable condition as it respects their
bodily, mental, and moral treatment."[51]

  [51] One would hardly be credited if he should put down half the
  instances of gross ignorance manifested by parents in this enlightened
  community [the State of Massachusetts] in the treatment of idiotic
  children. Sometimes they find that the children seem to comprehend what
  they hear, but soon forget it; hence they conclude that the brain is
  soft, and can not retain impressions, and then they cover the head with
  cold poultices of oak-bark in order to tan or harden the fibers. Others,
  finding that it is exceedingly difficult to make any impression upon the
  mind, conclude that the brain is too hard, and they torture the poor
  child with hot and softening poultices of bread and milk; or they
  plaster tar over the whole skull, and keep it on for a long time. These
  are innocent applications compared with some, which doubtless render
  weak-minded children perfectly idiotic.--DR. S. G. HOWE.

  What a striking illustration have we here of the necessity of diffusing
  correct physiological information more widely among the masses than has
  yet been done even in enlightened Massachusetts!

The commissioners come to the unquestionable conclusion in their report that "nothing can afford
a stronger argument in favor of an institution for the proper training and teaching of idiots,
and the dissemination of information upon the subject, than the striking difference manifested
in the condition of the few children who are properly cared for and judiciously treated, and
those who are neglected or abused. There are cases in our community of youths who are idiotic
from birth, but who, under proper care and training, have become cleanly in person, quiet in
deportment, industrious in habits, and who would almost pass in society for persons of common
intelligence; and yet their natural capacity was no greater than that of others, who, from
ignorance or neglect of their parents, have become filthy, gluttonous, lazy, vicious, depraved,
and are rapidly sinking into driveling idiocy. This fact alone should be enough to encourage
the state to take measures at once for the establishment of a school or institution for teaching
or training idiots, if it were but a matter of experiment."

Massachusetts is the only state in the Union that as yet has attempted to do any thing for
the education and training of this hitherto neglected class of persons. The result of the first
year's experiment has been most gratifying and encouraging. Of the whole number received, there
was not one who was in a situation where any great improvement in his condition was probable,
or hardly possible; they were growing worse in habits, and more confirmed in their idiocy.
But the process of deterioration in the pupils has been entirely stopped, and that of improvement
has commenced; and though a year is a very short time in the instruction of such persons, yet
its effects are manifest in all of them. They have improved in personal appearance and habits,
in general health, in vigor, and in activity of body. Some of them can control their appetites
in a considerable degree; they sit at the table with their teachers, and feed themselves decently.
Almost all of them have improved in the understanding and the use of speech. Some of them have
made considerable progress in the knowledge of language; they can select words printed on slips
of paper, and a few can read simple sentences. But, what is most important, THEY HAVE MADE
A START FORWARD.

"There is ground for confidence that the reasonable hopes of the friends of the experiment
will be satisfied. All that they promised has been accomplished, so far as was possible in
the period of a year. It has been demonstrated that idiots are CAPABLE OF IMPROVEMENT, and
that they can be raised from a state of low degradation to a HIGHER CONDITION. How far they
can be elevated, and to what extent they may be educated, can only be shown by the experience
of the future. The result of the past year's trial, however, gives confidence that each succeeding
year will show even more progress than any preceding one."

EDUCATION AND INSANITY.--It is well established that a defective and faulty education through
the period of infancy and childhood is one of the most prolific causes of insanity. Such an
education, or rather miseducation, causes a predisposition in many, and excites one where it
already exists, which ultimately renders the animal propensities of our nature uncontrollable.
Appetites indulged and perverted, passions unrestrained, propensities rendered vigorous by
indulgence, and subjected to no salutary restraint, bring persons into a condition in which
both moral and physical causes easily operate to produce insanity, if they do not produce it
themselves.

We must look to well-directed systems of popular education, having for their object physical
improvement, no less than mental and moral culture, to relieve us from many of the evils which
"flesh is heir to," and nothing can so effectually secure us from this most formidable disease
(as well as from others not less appalling) as that system of instruction which teaches us
how to preserve the normal condition of the body and the mind; to fortify the one against the
catalogue of physical causes which every where assail us, and to elevate the other above the
influence of the trials and disappointments of life, so that the host of moral causes which
affect the brain, through the medium of the mind, shall be inoperative and harmless.

Those first principles of physical education which teach us how to avoid disease are all-important
to all liable to insanity from hereditary predisposition. The physical health must be attended
to, and the training of the faculties of the mind be such as to counteract the over-active
propensities of our nature--correcting the bias of the mind to wrong currents and to too great
activity by bringing into action the antagonizing powers, and thus giving a sound body and
a well-balanced mind. Neglect of this early training entails evils upon the young which are
felt in all after life.

These positions are stated and amplified in the able reports of Dr. S. B. Woodward, superintendent
of the State Lunatic Asylum, Worcester, Mass., to which the reader is referred. They are also
corroborated by persons who have had the care of the insane in other institutions. In the eighteenth
annual report of the physician and superintendent of the Connecticut Retreat for the Insane,
Dr. Brigham says, "a knowledge of the nature of the disease would frequently lead to its prevention.
Insanity, in most cases, arises from undue excitement and labor of the brain; for even if a
predisposition to it is inherited, an exciting cause is essential to its development. Hence
every thing likely to cause great excitement of the brain, especially in early life, should
be avoided.

"The records of cases at this institution and my own observation justify me in saying that
the neglect of moral discipline, the too great indulgence of the passions and emotions in early
life, together with the excessive and premature exercise of the mental powers, are among the
most frequent causes that predispose to insanity. But these causes are in no other way operative
in producing insanity than by unduly exciting the brain. By neglect of moral discipline, a
character is formed subject to violent passions, and to extreme emotions and anxiety from the
unavoidable evils and disappointments of life, and thus the brain, by being often and violently
agitated, becomes diseased; and by too early exercising and prematurely developing the mental
powers, this organ is rendered more susceptible and liable to disease.

"I am confident there is too much mental labor imposed upon youth at our schools and colleges.
There have been several admissions of young ladies at this institution direct from boarding-schools,
and of young men from college, where they had studied excessively. Should such intense exertion
of the mind in youth not lead to insanity or immediate disease, it predisposes to dyspepsy,
hysteria, hypochondriasis, and affections allied to insanity, and which are often its precursors.
Should that portion of the community who now act most wisely in obtaining a knowledge of the
functions of the digestive organs, and in carefully guarding them from undue excitation, be
equally regardful of the brain, they would do a very great service to society, and, in my opinion,
do much toward arresting the alarming increase of insanity, and all disorders of the nervous
system."[52]

  [52] In the education of many, very many, I fear, the same mistake is
  made as in the case of Lord Dudley, thus described in a late number of
  the London Quarterly Review: "The irritable susceptibility of the brain
  was stimulated at the expense of bodily power and health. His foolish
  tutors took a pride in his precocious progress, which they ought to have
  kept back. They watered the forced plant with the blood of life; they
  encouraged the violation of Nature's laws, which are not to be broken in
  vain; they infringed the condition of conjoint moral and physical
  existence; they imprisoned him in a vicious circle, where the overworked
  brain injured the stomach, which reacted to the injury of the brain.
  They watched the slightest deviation from the rules of logic, and
  neglected those of dietetics, to which the former are a farce. They
  thought of no exercises but Latin; they gave him a Gradus instead of a
  cricket-bat, until his mind became too keen for its mortal coil, and the
  foundation was laid for ill health, derangement of stomach, moral
  pusillanimity, irresolution, lowness of spirits, and all the Protean
  miseries of nervous disorders, by which his after life was haunted, and
  which are sadly depicted in almost every letter before us."

EDUCATION INCREASES HUMAN HAPPINESS.

    All the happiness of man is derived from discovering, applying, or
    obeying the laws of his Creator; and all his misery is the result of
    ignorance or disobedience.--DR. WAYLAND.

If the doctrines taught and the sentiments inculcated in the preceding chapters of this work,
but more especially in the preceding sections of this chapter, are true; if it is established
that education dissipates the evils of ignorance; that it increases the productiveness of labor;
that it diminishes pauperism and crime--if all this is true, it may seem a work of supererogation
to attempt the establishment of the proposition that education increases human happiness. I
admit this seeming impropriety; for that the proposition is true may be legitimately inferred
from what has gone before. But I wish to amplify and extend this thought, and to show that
education has, if possible, still higher claims upon our attention than have yet been presented;
that it not only has the power of removing physical and moral evils, and of multiplying and
augmenting personal and social enjoyments, but that, when rightly understood, it constitutes
our chief good; that to it, and to it only, we may safely look for man's highest and enduring
joys, and for the permanent elevation of the race.

MAN IN IGNORANCE.--That we may be the better prepared to appreciate the advantages of education,
and its usefulness as a means of increasing human happiness, let us consider the state and
the enjoyments of the man whose mind is shrouded in ignorance. He grows up to manhood like
a vegetable, or like one of the lower animals that are fed and nourished for the slaughter.
He exerts his physical powers because such exertion is necessary for his subsistence. Were
it otherwise, we should most frequently find him dozing over the fire with a gaze as dull and
stupid as his ox, regardless of every thing but the gratification of his appetites. He has,
perhaps, been taught the art of reading, but has never applied it to the acquisition of knowledge.
His views are chiefly confined to the objects immediately around him, and to the daily avocations
in which he is employed. His knowledge of society is circumscribed within the limits of his
neighborhood, and his views of the world are confined within the range of the country in which
he resides, or of the blue hills which skirt his horizon.

Of the aspect of the globe in other countries, of the various tribes with which these are peopled,
of the seas and rivers, continents and islands, which diversify the landscape of the earth,
of the numerous orders of animated beings which people the ocean, the atmosphere, and the land,
of the revolutions of nations, and the events which have taken place in the history of the
world, he has almost as little conception as have the animals which range the forest.

In regard to the boundless regions that lie beyond him in the firmament, and the bodies that
roll there in magnificent grandeur, he has the most confused and inaccurate ideas; indeed,
he seldom troubles himself with inquiries in relation to such subjects. Whether the stars are
great or small, whether they are near us or at a distance, and whether they move or stand still,
are to him matters of trivial importance. If the sun gives him light by day and the moon by
night, and the clouds distil their watery treasures upon his parched fields, he is contented,
and leaves all such inquiries and investigations to those who have leisure and inclination
to engage in them. He views the canopy of heaven as merely a ceiling to our earthly habitation,
and the starry orbs as only so many luminous tapers to diversify its aspect, and to afford
a glimmering light to the benighted traveler.

Such a person has no idea of the manner in which the understanding may be enlightened and expanded
by education; he has no relish for intellectual pursuits, and no conception of the pleasures
they afford; and he sets no value on knowledge but in so far as it may increase his riches
and his sensual gratifications. He has no desire for making improvements in his trade or domestic
arrangements, and gives no countenance to those useful inventions and public improvements which
are devised by others. He sets himself against every innovation, whether religious, political,
mechanical, or agricultural, and is determined to abide by the "good old customs" of his forefathers,
even though they compel him to carry his grist to mill in one end of a bag, with a stone in
the other to balance it. Were it dependent upon him, the moral world would stand still, as
the material world was supposed to in former times; all useful inventions would cease; existing
evils would never be remedied; ignorance and superstition would universally prevail; the human
mind would be arrested in its progress to perfection, and man would never arrive at the true
dignity of his intellectual nature.

It is evident that such an individual--and the world contains thousands and millions of such
characters--can never have his mind elevated to those sublime objects and contemplations which
enrapture the man of science, nor feel those pure and exquisite pleasures which cultivated
minds so frequently experience; nor can he form those lofty and expansive conceptions of the
Deity which the grandeur and magnificence of his works are calculated to inspire. He is left
as a prey to all those foolish notions and vain alarms which are engendered by ignorance and
superstition; and he swallows, without the least hesitation, all the absurdities and childish
tales respecting witches, hobgoblins, specters, and apparitions, which have been handed down
to him by his forefathers.

While the ignorant man thus gorges his mind with fooleries and absurdities, he spurns at the
discoveries of science as impositions on the credulity of mankind, and contrary to reason and
common sense. That the sun is a million of times larger than the earth; that light flies from
his body at the rate of a hundred thousand miles in the hundredth part of a second; and that
the earth is whirling round its axis from day to day with a velocity of a thousand miles every
hour, are regarded by him as notions far more improbable and extravagant than the story of
the "Wonderful Lamp," and all the other tales of the "Arabian Night's Entertainments." In his
hours of leisure from his daily avocations, his thoughts either run wild among the most groveling
objects, or sink into sensuality and inanity; and solitude and retirement present no charms
to his vacant mind.

While human beings are thus immersed in ignorance, destitute of rational ideas and of a solid
substratum of thought, they can never experience those pleasures and enjoyments which flow
from the exercise of the understanding, and which correspond to the dignity of a rational and
immortal nature.

AN ENLIGHTENED MIND.--On the other hand, the man whose mind is irradiated with the light of
substantial science has views, and feelings, and exquisite enjoyments to which the former is
an entire stranger. In consequence of the numerous and multifarious ideas he has acquired,
he is introduced, as it were, into a new world, where he is entertained with scenes, objects,
and movements, of which the mind enveloped in ignorance can form no conception. He can trace
back the stream of time to its commencement, and, gliding along its downward course, can survey
the most memorable events which have happened in every part of its progress, from the primeval
ages to the present day; the rise of empires, the fall of kings, the revolutions of nations,
the battles of warriors, and the important events which have followed in their train; the progress
of civilization, and of the arts and sciences; the judgments which have been inflicted on wicked
nations, the dawnings of Divine mercy toward our fallen race, the manifestation of the Son
of God in our nature, the physical changes and revolutions which have taken place in the constitution
of our globe; in short, the whole of the leading events in the chain of divine dispensation,
from the beginning of the world to the period in which we live.

With his mental eye the enlightened man can survey the terraqueous globe in all its variety
of aspects; he can contemplate the continents, islands, and oceans which surround its exterior;
the numerous rivers by which it is indented; the lofty ranges of mountains which diversify
its surface; its winding caverns; its forests, lakes, and sandy deserts; its whirlpools, boiling
springs, and glaciers; its sulphurous mountains, bituminous lakes, and the states and empires
into which it is distributed; the tides and currents of the ocean; the icebergs of the polar
regions, and the verdant scenes of the torrid zone.

Sitting at his fireside during the blasts of winter, the enlightened man can survey the numerous
tribes of mankind scattered over the various climates of the earth, and entertain himself with
views of their manners, customs, religion, laws, trade, manufactures, marriage ceremonies,
civil and ecclesiastical governments, arts, sciences, cities, towns, and villages, and the
animals peculiar to every region. In his rural walks he can not only appreciate the beneficence
of Nature, and the beauties and harmonies of the vegetable kingdom in their exterior aspect,
but he can also penetrate into the hidden processes which are going on in the roots, trunks,
and leaves of plants and flowers, and contemplate the numerous vessels through which the sap
is flowing from their roots through the trunks and branches; the millions of pores through
which their odoriferous effluvia exhale; their fine and delicate texture; their microscopical
beauties; their orders, genera, and species, and their uses in the economy of nature.

Even when shrouded in darkness and in solitude, where other minds could find no enjoyment,
the man of knowledge can entertain himself with the most sublime contemplations. He can trace
the huge earth we inhabit flying through the depths of space, carrying along with it its vast
population, at the rate of sixty thousand miles every hour, and, by the inclination of its
axis, bringing about the alternate succession of summer and winter, of seed-time and harvest.
By the aid of his telescope he can transport himself toward the moon, and survey the circular
plains, the deep caverns, the conical hills, the lofty peaks, and the rugged and romantic mountain
scenery which diversify the surface of this orb of night.

By the help of the same instrument he can range through the planetary system, wing his way
through the regions of space along with the swiftest orbs, and trace many of the physical aspects
and revolutions which have a relation to distant worlds. He can transport himself to the planet
Saturn, and behold a stupendous ring six hundred thousand miles in circumference, revolving
in majestic grandeur every ten hours around a globe nine hundred times larger than the earth,
while seven moons larger than ours, along with an innumerable host of stars, display their
radiance to adorn the firmament of that magnificent world. He can wing his flight through the
still more distant regions of the universe, leaving the sun and all his planets behind him,
till they appear like a scarcely discernible speck in creation, and contemplate thousands and
millions of stars and starry systems beyond the range of the unassisted eye, and wander among
the suns and worlds dispersed throughout the boundless dimensions of space.

In his imagination he can fill up those blanks which astronomy has never directly explored,
and conceive thousands of systems and ten thousands of worlds beyond all that is visible by
the optic tube, stretching out to infinity on every hand, peopled with intelligences of various
orders, and all under the superintendence and government of the "King Eternal, Immortal, and
Invisible," whose power is omnipotent, and the limit of his dominions past finding out.

It is evident that a mind capable of such excursions and contemplations as I have now supposed
must experience enjoyments infinitely superior to those of the individual whose soul is enveloped
in intellectual darkness. If substantial happiness is chiefly situated in the mind; if it depends
on the multiplicity of objects which lie within the range of its contemplation; if it is augmented
by the view of scenes of beauty and sublimity, and displays of infinite intelligence and power;
if it is connected with tranquillity of mind, which generally accompanies intellectual pursuits,
and the subjugation of the pleasures of sense to the dictates of reason, the enlightened mind
must enjoy gratifications as far superior to those of the ignorant as man is superior in station
and capacity to the worms of the dust.

In order to illustrate this topic a little further, I shall select a few facts and deductions
in relation to science, which demonstrate the interesting nature and delightful tendency of
scientific pursuits.

There are several recorded instances of the powerful effect which the study of astronomy has
produced upon the human mind. Dr. Rittenhouse, of Pennsylvania, after he had calculated the
transit of Venus, which was to happen June 3d, 1769, was appointed, at Philadelphia, with others,
to repair to the township of Norriston, and there to observe this planet until its passage
over the sun's disc should verify the correctness of his calculations. This occurrence had
never been witnessed but twice before by an inhabitant of our earth, and was never to be again
seen by any person then living. A phenomenon so rare, and so important in its bearings upon
astronomical science, was, indeed, well calculated to agitate the soul of one so alive as he
was to the great truths of nature. The day arrived, and there was no cloud on the horizon.
The observers, in silence and trembling anxiety, awaited for the predicted moment of observation
to arrive. It came, and in the instant of contact, an emotion of joy so powerful was excited
in the bosom of Dr. Rittenhouse that he fainted.

Sir Isaac Newton, after he had advanced so far in his mathematical proof of one of his great
astronomical doctrines as to see that the result was to be triumphant, was so affected in view
of the momentous truth he was about to demonstrate that he was unable to proceed, and begged
one of his companions in study to relieve him, and carry out the calculation. These are striking
illustrations, and the effect is perhaps heightened from their connection with a most sublime
science, all of whose conclusions stand in open contradiction with those of superficial and
vulgar observation.

But the discovery and contemplation of truths in philosophy, chemistry, and the mathematics
have, in numerous instances, awakened kindred emotions. The enlightened man sees in every thing
he beholds upon the surface of the earth, whether animal or vegetable, and in the very elements
themselves, no less than when contemplating the wonders of astronomy, instances innumerable
illustrative of the wisdom and beneficence of the Architect, all of which has a direct tendency
to increase his happiness. In the invisible atmosphere which surrounds him, where other minds
discern nothing but an immense blank, he beholds an assemblage of wonders, and a striking scene
of divine wisdom and omnipotence. He views this invisible agent not only as a material, but
as a compound substance, composed of two opposite principles, the one the source of flame and
animal life, and the other destructive to both. He perceives the atmosphere as the agent under
the Almighty which produces the germination and growth of plants, and all the beauties of the
vegetable creation; which preserves water in a liquid state, supports fire and flame, and produces
animal heat; which sustains the clouds, and gives buoyancy to the feathered tribes; which is
the cause of winds, the vehicle of smells, the medium of sounds, the source of all the pleasures
we derive from the harmonies of music, the cause of the universal light and splendor which
is diffused around us, and of the advantages we derive from the morning and evening twilight.
He contemplates it as the prime mover in a variety of machines, as impelling ships across the
ocean, raising balloons to the region of the clouds, blowing our furnaces, raising water from
the deepest pits, extinguishing fires, and performing a thousand other beneficent agencies,
without which our globe would cease to be habitable. No one can doubt that all these views
and contemplations have a direct tendency to enlarge the capacity of the mind, to stimulate
its faculties, and to produce rational enjoyment.

But there is another view of this subject which is perhaps still more impressive. The atmosphere,
it has been stated, is a compound substance. A knowledge of its elementary principles, which
chemistry teaches, introduces its possessor to a new world of happiness. It will suffice for
our present purpose simply to remind the reader that the atmosphere is composed of the two
gases, oxygen and nitrogen, united in the ratio of one to four by volume. Oxygen is a supporter
of combustion, nitrogen is not. Increase the proportion of oxygen in the air, and the same
substances burn with increased brilliancy; but diminish the proportion gradually, and they
will burn more and more dimly until they become extinct. Iron and steel, as well as wood and
the ordinary combustibles, will burn with great brilliancy in pure oxygen.

  [53] See Chapter IV., especially from the 89th page to the 105th.

Water, I may add, is composed of the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen. The former, as we have
seen, is a supporter of combustion, and the latter is one of the most combustible substances
known. These two gases are nearly two thousand times more voluminous than their equivalent
of water, and, when ignited, they combine with explosive energy. He who understands the first
principles of chemical science can not fail to perceive how readily (and in perfect accordance
with laws well understood) such a general conflagration would take place were the great Architect
simply to resolve these two elements--air and water--into their constituent parts.

One more illustration must suffice. All fluids, except water, contract in volume as they become
colder to the point of congelation. But the point of greatest density in water is about eight
degrees above freezing. As the temperature of ALL fluids increases above this point, their
volume increases. As the temperature of all fluids, with the single exception of WATER, decreases,
the volume decreases down to the freezing point. Water increases in density as it becomes colder
until it reaches the temperature of forty degrees--eight degrees above the freezing point--when
it begins to expand. This only exception to the general law of fluids is of greater importance
in the economy of nature than most persons are conscious of. As the cold season advances in
the temperate and frigid zones, the water in our lakes and rivers is reduced to the temperature
of forty degrees; but at this point, by a beneficent provision of an All-wise Providence, the
upper substratum becomes specifically lighter, and is converted into a covering of ice, which,
resting upon the water beneath, protects it from freezing. Moreover, when water is converted
into ice, one hundred and forty degrees of heat are given out, a part of which, entering into
the water below, retards the further formation of ice.[54]

  [54] I may here add, that exactly the reverse is true in the melting
  of snow and ice. It requires as much heat to convert these solids into
  fluids, without at all increasing their temperature, as it does to raise
  the temperature of water from the freezing point, one hundred and forty
  degrees, or from thirty-two to one hundred and seventy-two degrees, as
  indicated by the thermometer. This principle is of vast importance to
  the world, and particularly to the inhabitants of cold countries, where
  the ground is covered with snow and ice a part or the whole of the year.
  The transition from the cold of winter to the heat of summer, in some of
  the northern climates, takes place within a few days. In these climates,
  also, there are vast accumulations of snow and ice, which, but for this
  principle, would be converted into water as soon as the temperature of
  the atmosphere becomes above thirty-two degrees, which would produce a
  flood sufficient to inundate and destroy the whole country. But the
  uniform action of this law renders the melting of snow gradual, and no
  such accident ensues.

  A similar law is observed in the conversion of water into vapor,
  which is of great use in enabling us to cool apartments by sprinkling
  floors or hanging up moistened cloths. The heat of even a whole city is
  in like manner greatly moderated by frequently sprinkling the streets.
  It is on this account that gentle showers in hot weather are so cooling
  and refreshing.

If water, like other fluids, continued to increase in density to the freezing point, the cold
air of winter would rob the water of our lakes and rivers of its heat, until the whole was
reduced to the temperature of thirty-two degrees; when, but for the circumstance to which we
have just alluded, it would be immediately converted into a solid mass of ice from top to bottom,
causing instant death to every animal living in it. The lower strata of such a mass of ice
would never again become liquefied.

This is a striking proof of the beneficence and design of the Creator in forming water with
such an exception to the ordinary laws of nature, and a knowledge of it can hardly fail to
exert a most salutary, elevating, and ennobling influence on the mind of its possessor. The
field of human happiness, then, with the virtuous, seems to enlarge in proportion as a knowledge
of the works and laws of the beneficent Creator is extended. There is little ground for doubt
as to what is GOD'S WILL in relation to the universal education of the family of man, when
he has connected with the exercise of mind in the study of his works superior enjoyments and
heavenly aspirations.

The various propositions stated and elucidated in this chapter, we think, are as fully established
as any moral truths need be, and, we doubt not, they commend themselves to the judgment and
conscience of all who have carefully perused the preceding pages, if, indeed, they had not
been duly considered and adopted before. If, then, a system of universal education, judiciously
administered, would dissipate the evils of ignorance, which are legion; if it would greatly
increase the productiveness of labor; if it would diminish--not to say exterminate--pauperism
and crime; if it would prevent the great majority of fatal accidents that are constantly occurring
in every community; if it would save the lives of a hundred thousand children in the United
States every year, and as many more puny survivors from dragging out a miserable existence
in consequence of being the offspring of ignorant or vicious parents; if it would prevent so
much of idiocy, and would humanize those who are born idiots only, but have hitherto been permitted,
nay, doomed to die BRUTES; if it would prevent so much insanity, and would save to society
and their family and friends, "clothed and in their right mind," multitudes of every generation
who now dwell in mental darkness and gloom; if it would increase the sum total of human happiness
in proportion to its excellence, and the number of persons who are brought under its benign
influence and uplifting power; if it would do all this--and that this is its legitimate tendency
there can be no doubt--it would seem that no enlightened community could be found in any country,
and especially that there can be no state in this Union, that would not at once resolve upon
maintaining a system of universal education by opening the doors of improved free schools to
all her sons and daughters, and, if need be, employing agents, vigilant and active, "to go
out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in." If this is not done, thousands
and tens of thousands of every generation will continue to lead cheerless lives, and will go
down to their graves like the brute that perisheth, without knowing that He who gave to man
life has also, in his goodness, which knows no bounds, provided that in the proper exercise
of his faculties man shall find an inexhaustible source of happiness.[55]

  [55] In the annual report of the Trustees of the New England Institution
  for the Education of the Blind for the year 1834, this beautiful passage
  occurs: "The expression of one of the pupils, 'that she had never
  known, before she began to learn, that it was a happiness to be alive,'
  may be applied to many."

CHAPTER IX.

POLITICAL NECESSITY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION.

    I do not hesitate to affirm not only that a knowledge of the true
    principles of government is important and useful to Americans, but
    that it is absolutely indispensable to carry on the government of
    their choice, and to transmit it to their posterity.--JUDGE STORY.

Every succeeding section of the last chapter went to show more and more clearly that, in proportion
as the benign influences of a correct education are diffused among and enjoyed by the members
of any community, will existing evils of every kind be diminished, and blessings be increased
in number and degree. The subject of popular education, then, claims, and should receive, the
sympathy and active support of every philanthropist and Christian, without regard to country
or clime. We come now to consider a topic in which every patriot, and especially every true
American, as such, must feel a lively interest.

Every citizen of our wide-spread country should be fully persuaded that the education of the
people is the only permanent basis of national prosperity not only, but of national SAFETY.
This, in theory, is now conceded, and the importance of education is very generally admitted
among men, especially in our own country. It is evident, however, that the conviction of its
importance is not so deeply inwrought into the mind of society as it ought to be, for it does
not manifest itself with all the power of earnest feeling in behalf of education which the
subject, in view of its acknowledged weightiness, justly demands.

The objects and advantages of education heretofore considered apply equally to men of every
nation and clime, under whatever form of government they may chance to dwell. It is otherwise
in regard to the political necessity of popular education. Here a particular training is required
to fit men for the government under which they are to live. In despotic governments, the object
of popular education is to make good subjects, while upon us devolves the higher responsibility
of so educating the people that they may become not only good subjects, but good SOVEREIGNS--all
power originating in and returning to the sovereign people.

Only seventy-four years ago, our fathers of the ever-memorable Revolution pledged "fortune,
life, and sacred honor" to establish the independence of these United States. Under the fostering
care of republican institutions, the tide of population rolled rapidly inland, crossing the
Alleganies, sweeping over the vast Valley of the Mississippi, nor resting in its onward course
until it settled on the waters of the Columbia and the shores of the Pacific. Previous to the
Revolutionary war, the English settlements were confined to the Atlantic coast; now the tide
of immigration seems to be to the shores of the Pacific, where states are multiplying and cities
springing up as by magic. In a little more than half a century, the states of the Union have
increased in number from thirteen to thirty, and in population in a ratio hitherto unprecedented,
from three millions to twenty-five millions of souls.

We stand in the same relation to posterity that our ancestors do to us. Each generation has
duties of its own to perform; and our duties, though widely different from those of our forefathers,
are not less important in their character or less binding in their obligations. It was their
duty to found or establish our institutions, and nobly did they perform it. It is our especial
and appropriate duty to perfect and perpetuate the institutions we have received at their hands.
The boon they would bequeath to the latest posterity can never reach and bless them except
through our instrumentality. Upon each present generation rest the duty and the obligation
of educating and qualifying for usefulness that which immediately succeeds, upon which, in
turn, will devolve a like responsibility. Each succeeding generation will, in the main, be
what the preceding has made it. From this responsible agency there is, there can be, no escape.

Trusts, responsibilities, and interests, vaster in amount and more sacred in character than
have ever, in the providence of God, been committed to any people, are now intrusted to us.
The great experiment of the capacity of man for self-government is being tried anew--an experiment
which, wherever it has been tried, has failed, through an incapacity in the people to enjoy
liberty without abusing it. We are, I doubt not, now educating the very generation during whose
lifetime this great question will be decided. The present generation will, to a great extent,
be responsible for the result, whatever it may be. We are, therefore, called upon, as American
citizens and Christian philanthropists, to do all that in us lies to secure to this experiment
a successful issue; to make this the leading nation of the earth, and a model worthy of imitation
by all others. Never before this has a nation been planted with so hopeful an opportunity for
becoming the universal benefactor of the race.

If for the next fifty years the population of these American States shall continue to increase
as during the last fifty, we shall exceed a hundred millions; and in a century, allowing the
same ratio of increase, the population will equal that of the Old World. Here, then, is a continent
to be filled with innumerable millions of human beings, who may be happy through our wisdom,
but who must be miserable through our folly. We may disregard such considerations, but we can
not escape the tremendous responsibilities rolling in upon us in view of the relations we sustain
to the past and the future. We delight to honor, in words, those heroes and martyrs from whom
we have received the rich boon of civil and religious liberty. Let us then, in deeds, imitate
the examples we profess to admire, and contribute our full quota, as individuals and as a generation,
toward perfecting and perpetuating the institutions we have received, that they may be enjoyed
by those countless millions who are to succeed us in this broad empire.

"In this exigency," to adopt the language of an enlightened practical educator and eminent
statesman, "we need far more of wisdom and rectitude than we possess. Preparations for our
present condition have been so long neglected, that we now have a double duty to perform. We
have not only to propitiate to our aid a host of good spirits, but we have to exorcise a host
of evil ones. Every aspect of our affairs, public and private, demonstrates that we need, for
their successful management, a vast accession to the common stock of intelligence and virtue.
But intelligence and virtue are the product of cultivation and training. They do not spring
up spontaneously. We need, therefore, unexampled alacrity and energy in the application of
all those influences and means which promise the surest and readiest returns of wisdom and
probity, both public and private.

"When the Declaration of Independence was carried into effect, and the Constitution of the
United States was adopted, the civil and political relations of the generation then living,
and of all succeeding ones, were changed. Men were no longer the same men, but were clothed
with new rights and responsibilities. Up to that period, so far as government was concerned,
they might have been ignorant; indeed, it has generally been held that where a man's only duty
is obedience, it is better that he should be ignorant; for why should a beast of burden be
endowed with the sensibilities of a man! Up to that period, so far as government was concerned,
a man might have been unprincipled and flagitious. He had no access to the statute-book to
alter or repeal its provisions, so as to screen his own violations of the moral law from punishment,
or to legalize the impoverishment and ruin of his fellow-beings. But with the new institutions,
there came new relations, and an immense accession of powers. New trusts of inappreciable value
were devolved upon the old agents and upon their successors, irrevocably.

"With the change in the organic structure of our government, there should have been corresponding
changes in all public measures and institutions. For every dollar given by the wealthy or by
the state to colleges to cultivate the higher branches of knowledge, a hundred should have
been given for primary education. For every acre of land bestowed upon an academy, a province
should have been granted to common schools. Select schools for select children should have
been discarded, and universal education should have joined hands with universal suffrage."[56]

  [56] From "an Oration delivered before the Authorities of the City of
  Boston, July 4th, 1842, by Horace Mann, Secretary of the Massachusetts
  Board of Education."

In the simplest form of civil government, there must exist a legislative, a judicial, and an
executive department. But no expression of the national will in a system of laws can be sufficiently
definite to supersede the necessity of a perpetual succession of Legislatures to supply defects,
and to meet emergencies as they arise. However well-informed men may be, and however pure the
motives by which they are actuated, all experience hath shown that subjects will come up for
consideration that will strike different minds in a variety of forms. This, in a popular government,
gives rise to opposing parties. Every man, then, in casting his vote for members of the Legislature,
needs to understand what important questions will be likely to come before that branch of the
government for settlement, to have examined them in their various bearings, and to have deliberately
made up his opinion in relation to the interests involved, in order to vote understandingly;
otherwise he will be as likely to oppose as to promote, not only the welfare of the state,
but his own most cherished interests.

The same remark that has been made in relation to the legislative department will apply to
both the judicial and executive, and to the general government as well as to the several state
governments. When the appointed day arrives for deciding the various questions of state and
national policy which divide men into opposing parties, there can be no delay. These various
and conflicting questions must be decided, whether much or little preparation has been made,
or none at all. And, what is most extraordinary, each voter helps to decide every question
which agitates the community as much by not voting as by voting. If the question is so vast
or so complicated that any one has not time to examine and make up his mind in relation to
it, or if any one is too conscientious to act from conjecture in cases of magnitude, and therefore
stays from the polls, another, who has no scruples about acting ignorantly, or from caprice,
or malevolence, votes, and, in the absence of the former, decides the question against the right.

However simple our government may be in theory, it has proved, in practice, the most complex
government on earth. More questions for legislative interposition, and for judicial exposition
and construction, have already arisen under it, ten to one, than have arisen during the same
length of time under any other form of government in Christendom. We are a Union of thirty
states; a great nation composed of thirty separate nations; and even beyond these, the confederacy
is responsible for the fate of vast territories, with their increasing population, and of numerous
Indian tribes. Among the component states, there is the greatest variety of customs, institutions,
and religions. Then we have the deeper inbred differences of language and ancestry among us,
our population being made up of the lineage of all nations. Our industrial pursuits, also,
are various; and, with a great natural diversity of soil and climate, they must always continue
to be so. Moreover, across the very center of our territory a line is drawn, on one side of
which all labor is voluntary, while on the opposite side a system of involuntary servitude
prevails.

If, then, general intelligence and popular virtue are necessary for the successful administration
of even the simplest forms of government, and if these qualities are required in a higher and
still higher degree in proportion to the complexity of a government, then are both intelligence
and virtue necessary in this government to an extent indefinitely beyond what has ever been
required in any other. And especially is this true when we consider that our government is
representative as it regards the people, and federative as it regards the states; and that,
in this respect, it has no precedent on the file of nations. We hence require a double portion
of general intelligence and practical wisdom. But men are not born in the possession of these
requisites to self-government, neither are they necessarily developed in the growth from infancy
to manhood. They are the product of cultivation and training, and can be secured only through
good schools opened to and enjoyed by all our youth. The stability of this government requires
that universal education should precede universal suffrage.

Under a free government, the intelligence of the people, coupled with their virtue, will be
found to be a sure index to a nation's prosperity, and to the individual and social well-being
of all who enjoy its protection. God is a being of infinite wisdom and goodness, and no part
of his government can be successfully administered except upon the principles of knowledge
and virtue. The success that attends a nation of freemen will depend upon the extent to which
these are cultivated, and the universality of their dissemination in the body politic. While
the cultivation of these will increase the safety of the government, their neglect will hasten
its downfall.

Judge Story, in a lecture upon the importance of the science of government as a branch of popular
education, has well remarked, that "it is not to rulers and statesman alone that the science
of government is important and useful. It is equally indispensable for every American citizen,
to enable him to exercise his own rights, to protect his own interests, and to secure the public
liberties and the just operations of public authority. A republic, by the very constitution
of its government, requires, on the part of the people, more vigilance and constant exertion
than any other form of government. The American Republic, above all others, demands from every
citizen unceasing vigilance and exertion, since we have deliberately dispensed with every guard
against danger or ruin except the intelligence and virtue of the people themselves. It is founded
on the basis that the people have wisdom enough to frame their own system of government, and
public spirit enough to preserve it; that they can not be cheated out of their liberties, and
they will not submit to have them taken from them by force. We have silently assumed the fundamental
truth that, as it never can be the interest of the majority of the people to prostrate their
own political equality and happiness, so they never can be seduced by flattery or corruption,
by the intrigues of faction or the arts of ambition, to adopt any measures which shall subvert
them. If this confidence in ourselves is justified--and who among Americans does not feel a
pride in endeavoring to maintain it?--let us never forget that it can be justified only by
a watchfulness and zeal in proportion to our confidence. Let us never forget that we must prove
ourselves wiser, better, and purer than any other nation ever has yet been, if we are to count
upon success. Every other republic has fallen by the discords and treachery of its own citizens.
It has been said by one of our own departed statesmen, himself a devout admirer of popular
government, that power is perpetually stealing from the many to the few."

The institutions of a republic are endangered by the ignorance of the masses on the one hand,
and by intelligent, but unprincipled and vicious aspirants to office and places of emolument
on the other. Where these two classes coexist to any considerable extent, the safety of the
republic is jeoparded; for they have a strong sympathy with each other, and it is the constant
policy of the latter to increase the number of the former. They arouse their passions and stimulate
their appetites, and then lead them in a way they know not. A barrel of whisky, or even of
hard cider, with a "hurrah!" will control ten to one more of this class of voters than will
the soundest arguments of enlightened and honorable statesmen. And yet one of these votes thus
procured, when deposited in the ballot-box, counts the same as the vote of a Washington or
a Franklin!

There is one remedy, and but one, for this alarming state of things, which prevails to a less
or greater extent in almost every community. That remedy is simple. It consists in the establishment
of schools for the education of the whole people. These schools, however, should be of a more
perfect character than the majority of those which have hitherto existed. In them the principles
of morality should be copiously intermingled with the principles of science. Cases of conscience
should alternate with lessons in the rudiments. The rule requiring us to do to others as we
would that they should do unto us, should be made as familiar as the multiplication table,
and our youth should become as familiar with the practical application of the one as of the
other. The lives of great and good men should be held up for admiration and example, and especially
the life and character of Jesus Christ, as the sublimest pattern of benevolence, of purity,
and of self-sacrifice ever exhibited to mortals. In every course of studies, all the practical
and preceptive parts of the Gospel should be sacredly inculcated, and all dogmatical theology
and sectarianism sacredly excluded. In no school should the Bible be opened to reveal the sword
of the polemic, but to unloose the dove of peace.

In connection with the preceding, and in addition to the branches now commonly taught in our
schools, the study of politics, which has been beautifully defined as the art of making a people
happy, should be generally introduced. "I am not aware," says an eminent jurist,[57] "that
there are any solid objections which can be urged against introducing the science of government
into our common schools as a branch of popular education. If it should be said that it will
have a tendency to introduce party creeds and party dogmas into our schools, the true answer
is, that the principles of government should be there taught, and not the creeds or dogmas
of any party. The principles of the Constitution under which we live; the principles upon which
republics generally are founded, by which they are sustained, and through which they must be
saved; the principles of public policy, by which national prosperity is secured, and national
ruin averted--these certainly are not party creeds or party dogmas, but are fit to be taught
at all times and on all occasions, if any thing which belongs to human life and our own condition
is fit to be taught. If we wait until we can guard ourselves against every possible chance
of abuse before we introduce any system of instruction, we shall wait until the current of
time has flowed into the ocean of eternity. There is nothing which ever has been or ever can
be taught without some chance of abuse; nay, without some absolute abuse. Even religion itself,
our truest and our only lasting hope and consolation, has not escaped the common infirmity
of our nature. If it never had been taught until it could be taught with the purity, simplicity,
and energy of the apostolic age, we ourselves, instead of being blessed with the bright and
balmy influences of Christianity, should now have been groping our way in the darkness of heathenism,
or left to perish in the cold and cheerless labyrinths of skepticism."

  [57] Joseph Story, before the American Institute of Instruction.

Lord Brougham, one of the most powerful advocates of popular education in our day, has made
the following remarks, which can not be more fitly addressed to any people than to the citizens
of the American States. "A sound system of government," says this transatlantic writer, "requires
the people to read and inform themselves upon political subjects; else they are the prey of
every quack, every impostor, and every agitator who may practice his trade in the country.
If they do not read; if they do not learn; if they do not digest by discussion and reflection
what they have read and learned; if they do not qualify themselves to form opinions for themselves,
other men will form opinions for them, not according to the truth and the interests of the
people, but according to their own individual and selfish interest, which may, and most probably
will, be contrary to that of the people at large."

Two very important inquiries here naturally suggest themselves to us: they are, first, whether
there is at present in this country a degree of intelligence sufficient for the wise administration
of its affairs; and secondly, whether existing provisions for the education of our country's
youth are adequate to the wants of a great and free people, who are endeavoring to demonstrate
to the world that great problem of nations--the capability of man for self-government. We judge
of the literary attainments of the citizens of a state or of a nation, as a whole, by comparing
all the individual members thereof with a given standard, and of their arrangements for educating
the rising generation by the character of their schools, and the proportion of the population
that receive instruction in them. Let us test the existing standard of education in various
states of this Union in both of these respects.

DEGREE OF POPULAR INTELLIGENCE.--According to the census of 1840,[58] the total population
of the United States was, in round numbers, seventeen millions. Of this number, five hundred
and fifty thousand were whites over twenty years of age, who could not read and write. The
proportion varies in different states, from one in five hundred and eighty-nine in Connecticut,
to one in eleven in North Carolina.

  [58] The census for 1850 is now being taken. Whether its results will
  tell more favorably upon the general interests of education in the
  United States than those of the last census, remains to be seen. Some of
  the states during the last ten years have done nobly; others have
  evidently retrograded. We have also a tide of foreign immigration
  pouring in upon us hitherto unprecedented, averaging a thousand a day
  for the past year, all of whom need to be Americanized.

If we exclude, in the estimate, all colored persons, and whites under twenty years of age,
the proportion will stand thus: in the United States, one to every twelve is unable to read
and write. The proportion varies in the different states, from one in two hundred and ninety-four
in Connecticut, which stands the highest, to one in three in North Carolina, which stands the
lowest. In Tennessee the proportion is one in four. In Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina,
and Arkansas, each, one in five. In Delaware and Alabama, each, one in six. In Indiana, one
in seven. In Illinois and Wisconsin, each, one in eight.

On the brighter end of the scale, next to Connecticut, in which the proportion is one in two
hundred and ninety-four, is New Hampshire, in which the proportion is one in one hundred and
fifty-nine. In Massachusetts it is one in ninety. In Maine, one in seventy-two. In Vermont,
one in sixty-three. Next in order comes Michigan, in which the proportion is one in thirty-nine.[59]

  [59] According to the last census, there were twenty states below
  Michigan, and only five above her. But even this estimate, favorable as
  it is in the scale of states, does not allow Michigan an opportunity to
  appear in her true light, for it is well known that a great proportion
  of the illiterate population of this state is confined to a few
  counties. In Mackinaw and Chippewa counties there is one white person
  over twenty years of age to every five of the entire population that is
  unable to read and write. In Ottawa, one in fourteen; in Cass, one in
  twenty-two; in Wayne and Saginaw, each, one in thirty-six. On the other
  hand, there were eight organized counties in the state in which,
  according to the census referred to, there was not a single white
  inhabitant over twenty years of age that was unable to read and write.
  It is an interesting fact, at least to persons residing in the
  Northwest, that in Ohio also (on the Western Reserve) there were seven
  such counties, making fifteen in these two states, while in all New
  England there were but two--Franklin in Massachusetts, and Essex in
  Vermont.

But these statements in relation to the number of persons in the United States who are unable
to read and write, although they give the fearful aggregate of five hundred and fifty thousand
over twenty years of age who are destitute of these qualifications, it is believed, fail to
discover much of gross ignorance that is cherished in various portions of the country; for
there is no state in the Union, nor any section of a single state, where men do not wish to
be accounted able to read and write. The deputy marshals who took the census received their
compensation by the head, and not by the day, for the work done. They therefore traveled from
house to house, making the shortest practicable stay at each. More was required of them than
could be thoroughly and accurately performed in the time allowed. Their informants were subjected
to no test. In the absence of the heads of families, whose information would have been more
reliable, the bare word of persons over sixteen years of age was accredited. It is, moreover,
well known, that no inconsiderable number of persons gave false information when inquired of
by the deputies. From these and other reasons, it is believed that numerous and important errors
exist in the census; and this opinion is corroborated by a mass of unquestionable testimony,
of which I will introduce a specimen.

The annual message of Governor Campbell, of Virginia, to the Legislature of that state, the
year immediately preceding that in which the census was taken, clearly shows that the capacity
to read and write in persons over twenty years of age was greatly over-estimated in that state.
Governor Campbell, after stating that the importance of an efficient system of education, embracing
in its comprehensive and benevolent design the whole people, can not be too frequently recurred
to, goes on to remark as follows:

"The statements furnished by the clerks of five city and borough courts, and ninety-three of
the county courts, in reply to the inquiries addressed to them, ascertain that, of all those
who applied for marriage licenses, a large number were unable to write their names. The years
selected for this inquiry were those of =1817=, =1827=, and =1837=. The statements show that
the applicants for marriage licenses for =1817= amounted to =4682=, of whom =1127= were unable
to write; =5048= in =1827=, of whom the number unable to write was =1166=; and in =1837= the
applicants were =4614=, and of these the number of =1047= were unable to write their names.
From which it appears there still exists a deplorable extent of ignorance, and that, in truth,
it is hardly less than it was twenty years ago, when the school fund was created.

"There are now in the state two hundred thousand children between the ages of five and fifteen.
Forty thousand of them are reported to be poor children, and of them only one half to be attending
schools. It may be safely assumed that, of those possessing property adequate to the expenses
of a plain education, a large number are growing up in ignorance, for want of schools within
convenient distances. Of those at school, many derive little or no instruction, owing to the
incapacity of the teachers, as well as to their culpable negligence and inattention. Thus the
number likely to remain uneducated, and to grow up without just perceptions of their duties,
religious, social, and political, is really of appalling magnitude, and such as to appeal with
affecting earnestness to a parental Legislature."

If there shall appear any want of agreement between these statements and the returns made by
the deputy marshals, no one need be in doubt in relation to which has the strongest claims
for credence. These statements were communicated by the governor of a proud state to the Legislature
in his annual message. Unlike the statistics collected by the marshals, each case was subjected
to an infallible test; for no man who could make a scrawl in the similitude of his name would
submit to the mortification of making his mark, and leaving it on record in a written application
for a marriage license. The requisition was made upon the officers of the courts, and the evidence,
which was of a documentary or judicial character, is the highest known to the law. The result
was, that almost one fourth of all the men applying for marriage licenses--more than thirty-three
hundred in three years--were unable to write their names! And Governor Campbell clearly intimates
an opinion that "the education of females is in a condition of much greater neglect!"

In round numbers, the free white population of Virginia over twenty years of age is three hundred
and thirty thousand. One fourth of this number is eighty-two and a half thousand, which, according
to the evidence presented by Governor Campbell, is the lowest possible limit at which the minimum
of adults unable to read and write can be stated. But the census number is less than fifty-nine
thousand, making a difference of nearly twenty-four thousand, or more than forty per cent.

There are several states of about the same rank as Virginia in the educational scale. Kentucky,
Tennessee, and North Carolina sink even below her. The last-named state, with a free white
population over twenty years of age of less than 210,000, has the appalling number, even according
to the census, of 56,609 who are unable to read and write. In other words, forty-two hundred
more than one fourth of the whole free population over twenty years of age are, in the educational
scale, absolutely below zero.

Now if to the five hundred and fifty thousand free white population in the United States over
the age of twenty years who are unable to read and write, as shown by the census, we add forty
per cent. for its under-estimates, as facts require us to do in the case of Virginia, it would
increase the total to seven hundred and seventy thousand. Suppose one fourth of these only
are voters--that is, deduct one half for females, and allow that one half of the male moiety
is made up of persons either between twenty and twenty-one years of age, or of those who are
unnaturalized, which is a most liberal allowance when we consider where the great mass of ignorance
belongs, and that the number of ignorant immigrants is much less at the South than at the North--and
we have =192,500= voters in the United States who are unable to read and write.

Now, at the presidential election for the same year that the census was taken, when, to use
the graphic language of another, "every voter not absolutely in his winding sheet was carried
to the polls, when the harvest field was so thoroughly swept that neither stubble nor tares
were left for the gleaner," the majority for the successful candidate was =146,081=, more than
=46,000= less than the estimated number of legal voters at that time in the United States unable
to read and write. At this election a larger majority of the electoral votes was given for
the successful candidate than was ever given to any other President of the United States, with
the exception of Mr. Monroe in =1820=, against whom there was but one vote. General Harrison's
popular majority, also, was undoubtedly the largest by which any President of the United States
has ever been elected, with the exception above mentioned of Mr. Monroe, and perhaps that of
General Washington at his second election. And yet this majority, large as it was, was more
than 46,000 less than the estimated number of our legal voters who, in the educational scale,
are absolutely below zero. It should also be borne in mind that popular virtue is not less
essential to the stability of a free government than is general intelligence. Nay, more; if
the liberties of this republic are more endangered by any one class of people than by all others,
that class consists of intelligent but unprincipled political aspirants. The connection between
ignorance and vice has already been referred to, and is well known among intelligent men; but
by none so well, it may be, as by the unprincipled aspirant, who, by pandering to the vicious
appetites of the ignorant and the vile, and then by base flattery pronouncing them "highly
intelligent, enlightened, and civilized," take advantage of their very want of qualification
"to manufacture political capital." We can not, then, avoid coming to the unwelcome and dread
conclusion that there is not at present in this country a sufficient degree of intelligence
and virtue for the wise, or even the safe administration of its affairs. It remains to consider
whether existing provisions for the education of our country's youth are adequate to the wants
of the American people.

EXISTING PROVISIONS FOR EDUCATION.--Of the seventeen millions of persons in the United States,
according to the last census, =3,726,080=--one in five of the entire population--were free
white children between the ages of five and fifteen years. This is the lowest estimate I have
ever known made of the ages between which children should regularly attend school. The ages
usually stated between which children generally should attend school at least ten months during
the year, are from four to sixteen, or from four to eighteen years, and sometimes from four
to twenty or twenty-one years.

But what is the actual attendance upon the primary and common schools of the country? It is
only =1,845,244=, or, to vary the expression and give it more definiteness, the total number
of children in attendance upon all our schools, any part of the year, is twenty thousand less
than one half of the free-born white children in the United States between the ages of five
and fifteen years! And then it should be borne in mind that the same general motives which
would lead to an under-statement in regard to the number of persons unable to read and write,
would lead to an over-statement in regard to the number of those attending school. The educational
statistics of some of the states, made out by competent and faithful school officers, show
that the whole number of scholars that attended school any part of the time during the school
year 1840-41--the year the census was taken--was several thousand less than the number according
to the census.[60]

  [60] In Massachusetts, according to a statement made by the Secretary of
  the Board of Education, the whole number of scholars who were in all the
  public schools any part of the school year 1840-41 was but 155,041, and
  the average attendance was, in the winter, 116,398, and in the summer,
  96,802; while the number given in the census is 158,351, which is
  greater by 3310 than the entire number that attended school any part of
  the year, according to the returns, and 55,751 more than the average
  attendance for half of the year.

If we were to embrace in the estimate the whole number of students in attendance at the universities,
colleges, academies, and seminaries of learning of every grade, it would not materially vary
the result, for all these taken together are less than one tenth part of the number in attendance
upon the common schools. That the number of children attending schools of any grade is less
than might be inferred from the foregoing statements, will be apparent when we consider the
following facts.

In the United States, taken together as a whole, only one person in ten of the population attends
any school whatever any part of the year. Now it is well known that a large number of children
under five years of age attend school in many parts of the country, and a much greater number
that are over fifteen years of age. This leaves two millions of children uninstructed. We shall
have a more just view of the scantiness of our provisions for adequate national education if
to this number, appalling as it is, we add the total number of those attending under five and
over fifteen in various portions of the country.

Again: no one supposes that in any part of the Union adequate provisions are made for the education
of the rising generation, even in a single state. But in the New England states, and in New
York and Michigan, one fourth part of the entire population attend school some part of the
year. This is twice and a half the general average throughout the Union, and more than five
times the average attendance in the majority of the remaining states.

In round numbers, the proportion of the entire population that attend school in the different
states of the Union is, according to the census, in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, each,
one in three. In Michigan,[61] Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, the proportion is
one in four. In Rhode Island, it is one in five. In Ohio and New Jersey, each, one in six.
In Pennsylvania, one in eight. In no other state is the proportion more than one in ten, while
in ten states it is less than one in twenty-five.

  [61] In determining the proportion for this state, the census for 1845
  and the school returns for that year were the data used. In the other
  states I have been obliged to use the census returns of 1840.

In fixing this proportion, the nearest whole number has been used. In no state is the proportion
in attendance upon the schools as high as one in three. Michigan heads the states in which
the proportion is one in four. In this state the proportion is somewhat greater than one in
four; it is, however, nearer this than one in three. In the other states the proportion is
less than one in four. The states are all arranged according to the size of the fraction, there
being less difference in the attendance in Vermont and Michigan than in the latter state and
New York.

At the time the last census was taken, Michigan had recently been admitted into the Union,
and the state government being but just organized, the school system had only gone partially
into operation. According to the census of =1840=, the proportion in attendance upon the schools
of this state was only one in seven. During the interval from =1840= to =1845=, at which time
the census of this state was again taken, the population had increased from two hundred and
twelve thousand to upward of three hundred thousand, showing an increase of about fifty per
cent.; the number of primary schools had increased from less than ten thousand to more than
twenty thousand, making an increase of more than one hundred per cent.; and the attendance
upon these schools had advanced from thirty thousand to seventy-six thousand, giving the very
remarkable increase of one hundred and fifty per cent. in five years, when, as already stated,
the proportion in attendance upon the common schools was more than one in four of the entire
population. And during the next two years the number of children in attendance upon the schools
increased from seventy-six thousand to one hundred and eight thousand, showing an advance of
more than forty per cent. from 1845 to 1847.

It is gratifying to know that this important interest, which underlies all others, is receiving
increased attention in various portions of the United States. Among the most striking illustrations
that I have noticed of these indications of national improvement, I will instance two.[62]
The following interesting items of fact are gleaned from an address by the superintendent before
the public schools of New Orleans, February 22d, 1850--a most befitting day for a school celebration.
These statistics strike us more forcibly when we consider that they relate to the metropolis
of the South, and to the capital of a state in which, according to the last census, only one
person in one hundred received instruction in the primary and common schools of the state.
The public schools of the second municipality of New Orleans were established in 1842, comprising
at that time less than three hundred pupils. Now the constant attendance is upward of three
thousand--ten times what it was eight years ago. But even this increase, large as it may seem,
is not sufficient to constitute the proportion in attendance upon the schools of the state
even one in fifty of the entire population.

  [62] My information is derived from the "Southern Journal of Education"
  for May, 1850--a monthly for the promotion of popular intelligence,
  published from Knoxville, Tenn.--Samuel A. Jewett, Editor and Publisher.
  This journal is ably conducted, and has now reached its third volume.
  This certainly is a very encouraging omen, especially when we consider
  that it has so long survived in a state where, according to the last
  census, only one in thirty-three of the entire population attended
  school. May it long continue to do good service in this important cause.

Kentucky furnishes the other indication of improvement which I propose to notice. In this state,
according to the last census, only one in thirty-three of the entire population attended the
common schools during any part of the year. The number of children at the present time in that
commonwealth, as reported by the second auditor, between the ages of five and sixteen, leaving
out the colored children, is one hundred and ninety-three thousand. The number provided with
schools, as reported in 1847, was twenty-one thousand; in 1848, thirty-three thousand; and
in 1849, eighty-seven thousand; showing a clear advance in two years of sixty-six thousand.[63]
But, with all this improvement, one hundred and five thousand children do not derive any personal
benefit from the public school system. In other words, eighteen thousand more children in this
state are still growing up without instruction than as yet attend the schools. And the utter
inadequacy of the common school privileges of even these will be apparent when it is understood
that in the great majority of the districts more than nine tenths of the schools are taught
but three months during the year.

  [63] This improvement well illustrates the advantages resulting to the
  state from the able and faithful supervision of her public schools. A
  correspondent of the Baltimore American speaks of the Annual Report of
  DR. ROBERT BRECKENRIDGE, Superintendent of Public Instruction, to the
  General Assembly of Kentucky, as follows: "It is the most important
  document which has been submitted to that body during the present
  session, and reflects great credit upon the energy, fidelity, and
  comprehensive aims of the superintendent in the discharge of his high
  duties. It is now but two years since Dr. Breckenridge was appointed to
  the office, and the great service he has rendered to the cause of
  popular education in the state is strikingly exhibited in the contrast
  between the present condition of the common schools, and that in which
  he found them when he received his appointment from the Board of
  Education."

We have as yet only considered the great destitution of schools of any kind, in which the moiety
of the children that attend school at all receive instruction, and the fact that very many
of these are kept open but three months during the year.[64] The inadequacy of existing provisions
for the proper education of the rising generation will be more strikingly apparent when we
consider the incompetency of, I may perhaps safely say, the majority of persons who are put
in charge of the public schools of the country. It is readily conceded that, in those states
where education has received most attention, there are many teachers who are thoroughly furnished
unto all good works. But it is far otherwise with the majority of teachers even in the more
favored states. The testimony of Governor Campbell already quoted, will apply to the teachers
of many other states.

  [64] Even in Massachusetts the average length of time the schools of the
  state continue is less than eight months, and the average continuance in
  several of the counties is only five months. The average attendance upon
  the schools for the time they are kept open is sixty-two per cent. of
  the number between the ages of four and sixteen years; but in some
  instances only twenty-six per cent. of the children in a town--about one
  fourth of the number within the school ages--attend school.

President Caldwell, of the University of North Carolina, in a series of letters on popular
education, addressed to the people of that state a few years ago, proposes a plan for the improvement
of common education. The first and greatest existing evil which he specifies is the want of
qualified teachers. Any one who "knows how to read, and write, and cipher," it is said, is
regarded as fit to be a "schoolmaster."

"Is a man," remarks President Caldwell, "constitutionally and habitually indolent, a burden
upon all from whom he can extract a support? Then there is one way of shaking him off; let
us make him a schoolmaster! To teach a school is, in the opinion of many, little else than
sitting still and doing nothing. Has any man wasted all his property, or ended in debt by indiscretion
and misconduct? The business of school-keeping stands wide open for his reception; and here
he sinks to the bottom, for want of capacity to support himself. Has any one ruined himself,
and done all he could to corrupt others by dissipation, drinking, seduction, and a course of
irregularities? Nay, has he returned from a prison, after an ignominious atonement for some
violation of the laws? He is destitute of character, and can not be trusted; but presently
he opens a school, and the children are seen flocking to it; for, if he is willing to act in
that capacity--we shall all admit that he can read, write, and cipher to the square root--he
will make an excellent schoolmaster. In short, it is no matter what the man is, or what his
manners or principles; if he has escaped with his life from the penal code, we have the satisfaction
to think that he can still have credit as a schoolmaster."

The Georgia convention of teachers, in a published address, after speaking of the importance
of giving a more extended education to our youth as citizens, and giving an outline of a liberal
system of popular education, go on to remark as follows: "Alas! how far should we be elevated
above our present level if all of them were thus enlightened! But how many sons and daughters
of free-born Americans are unable to read their native language! How many go to the polls who
are unable to read the very charter of their liberties! How many, by their votes, elect men
to legislate upon their dearest interests, while they themselves are unable to read even the
proceedings of those legislators whom they have empowered to act for them!"

In accounting for this lamentable state of things, the committee of the Convention say, "We
seem to forget that first principles are, in education, all-important principles; that primary
schools are the places where these principles are to be established, and where such direction
will, in all probability, be given to the minds of our children as will decide their future
character in life. Hence the idle, and the profane, and the drunken, and the ignorant are employed
to impart to our children the first elements of knowledge--are set before them as examples
of what literature and science can accomplish! And hence the profession of schoolmaster, which
should be the most honorable, is but too often a term of reproach."

That other most unwelcome and dread conclusion, that existing provisions for popular education
in the United Slates are inadequate to the requirements of a free people, is, then, in view
of all these facts, unavoidably forced upon us.

In the name of Christian philanthropy, in the name of patriotism, then, I inquire whether there
is any ground for hope that our free institutions may be transmitted unimpaired to posterity.
"With the heroes, and sages, and martyrs of the Revolution," to adopt the language of another,
"I believe in the capability of man for self-government, my whole soul thereto most joyously
assenting. Nay, if there be any heresy among men, or blasphemy against God, at which the philosopher
might be allowed to forget his equanimity, and the Christian his charity, it is the heresy
and the blasphemy of believing and avowing that the infinitely good and all-wise Author of
the universe persists in creating and sustaining a race of beings who, by a law of their nature,
are forever doomed to suffer all the atrocities and agonies of misgovernment, either from the
hands of others or from their own. The doctrine of the inherent and necessary disability of
mankind for self-government should be regarded not simply with denial, but with abhorrence;
not with disproof only, but with execration. To sweep so foul a creed from the precincts of
truth, and utterly to consume it, rhetoric should become a whirlwind, and logic fire. Indeed,
I have never known a man who desired the establishment of monarchical and aristocratical institutions
among us, who had not a mental reservation that, in such case, he and his family should belong
to the privileged orders.

"Still, if asked the broad question whether man is capable of self-government, I must answer
it conditionally. If by man, in the inquiry, is meant the Fejee Islanders; or the convicts
at Botany Bay; or the people of Mexico and of some of the South American Republics, so called;
or those as a class, in our own country, who can neither read nor write; or those who can read
and write, and who possess talents and an education by force of which they get treasury, or
post-office, or bank appointments, and then abscond with all the money they can steal, I answer
unhesitatingly that man, or rather such men, are not fit for self-government.

"But if, on the other hand, the inquiry be whether mankind are not endowed with those germs
of intelligence and those susceptibilities of goodness by which, under a perfectly practicable
system of cultivation and training, they are able to avoid the evils of despotism and anarchy,
and also of those frequent changes in national policy which are but one remove from anarchy,
and to hold steadfastly on their way in an endless career of improvement, then, in the full
rapture of that joy and triumph which springs from a belief in the goodness of God and the
progressive happiness of man, I answer, THEY ARE ABLE."

PRACTICABILITY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION.

    The first duty of government, and the surest evidence of good
    government, is the encouragement of education. A general diffusion
    of knowledge is the precursor and protector of republican
    institutions; and in it we must confide, as the conservative power
    that will watch our liberties, and guard against fraud, intrigue,
    corruption, and violence.--DE WITT CLINTON's Message to the New
    York Legislature, 1826.

    If good is to be done, we must bring our minds, as soon as possible,
    to the confession of the truth, that the education of the people, to
    be effectual, must here, as elsewhere, to a great extent, be the
    work of the state; and that an expense, of which all should feel the
    necessity, and all will share the benefit, must, in a just
    proportion, be borne by all.--JOHN DUER.

The desirableness of national or universal education is now generally admitted in all enlightened
communities; but there are some who, honestly no doubt, question its practicability. If they
provide for the education of their own children, they claim that they have done all that duty
or interest requires them to do. They even aver that there is absolute injustice in compelling
them to contribute toward the education of the children of others. Now these very persons,
when called upon annually by the tax-gatherer to contribute their proportion for the support
of paupers--made so by idleness, intemperance, and other vices, which, as we have already seen,
result from ignorance--do so cheerfully and ungrudgingly, and without complaining that they
support themselves and their families, and that neither duty nor interest requires them to
aid in the maintenance of indigent persons in the community.

The Poor Laws of our country, in the case of adults who are unable to support themselves, require
merely their maintenance. But with reference to their children, more, from the very nature
of the case, is needed. Their situation imperatively demands not only a sustenance, but an
education that shall enable them in future years to provide for themselves. The same humane
reasons which lead civilized communities to provide for the maintenance of indigent adults
by legal enactments, bear even more strongly in the case of their children. These require sustenance
in common with their parents. But their wants, their necessities, stop not here; neither does
the well-being of society with reference to them. Both alike require that such children, in
common with all others, be so trained as to be enabled not only to provide for themselves when
they arrive at mature years, but as shall be necessary to qualify them for the discharge of
the duties of citizenship. Then, instead of taxing society for a support, as their parents
now do, they will contribute to the elevation of all around, even more largely than society
has contributed to their elevation.

Let the necessary provision be made for the education of the children of the poor, in common
with all others, and successive generations of the sons of men will steadily progress in knowledge
and virtue, and in all that has a tendency to elevate and ennoble human kind. But let their
education be neglected, and their rank in society will of necessity be lower, when compared
with the better educated and more favored classes, than it would have been only two or three
centuries ago, even since the invention of the art of printing in 1440. The reasons are evident.
Until after the invention of printing and the multiplication of books, all ranks were, in relation
to education, nearly upon a level. But, in the language of the adage, "Knowledge is power;"
and, since "knowledge has been increased," those who possess it are elevated, relatively and
absolutely, while those who remain in the ignorance of former generations, although their absolute
condition in the scale of being is unchanged, occupy, nevertheless, relatively, a lower place
in society than they would have done had they lived in the midst of the Dark Ages.

Wherever improved free schools have been maintained, not only are the children of the poor
in attendance upon them elevated in the scale of intellectual, social, and moral being, but,
through their irresistible influence, their degraded and besotted parents have been reformed
and become law-abiding subjects, when all other means had failed to reach and influence them.
Of the truth of this statement I am well persuaded from my own observation. I have also in
my possession an abundance of unquestionable testimony to this effect, gathered in cities,
towns, and villages which have become celebrated for the maintenance of a high order of public
schools. The public, then, on many accounts, are more interested in the right education of
poor children than in the preservation of their lives! The latter is carefully provided for.
But if this only is done; if their bodies are fed and clothed, without providing for the sustenance
of their minds; if we provide for their wants as helpless young animals merely, but neglect
to provide for their necessities as spiritual and immortal beings, the probabilities are that
such children will become a pest to society, while, in providing for their proper education,
we are sure of making them good citizens, of constituting them a blessing to the world that
now is, and of brightening their prospects for a blessed immortality in that which is to come.

Bishop Butler, in a sermon preached in Christ Church, London, on charity schools, May 9th,
1745, recognizes the principle that the property of the state should educate the children of
the state. "Formerly," says he, "not only the education of poor children, but also their maintenance,
with that of the other poor, were left to voluntary charities. But great changes of different
sorts happening over the nation, and charity becoming more cold, or the poor more numerous,
it was found necessary to make some legal provision for them. This might, much more properly
than charity schools, be called a new scheme;[65] for, without question, the education of poor
children was all along taken care of by voluntary charities, more or less, but obliging us
by law to maintain the poor was new in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Yet, because a change
of circumstances made it necessary, its novelty was no reason against it. Now, in that legal
provision for the maintenance of the poor, poor children must doubtless have had a part in
common with grown people. But this could never be sufficient for children, because their case
always requires more than mere maintenance; it requires that they be educated in some proper
manner. Wherever there are poor who want to be maintained by charity, there must be poor children,
who, besides this, want to be educated by charity; and whenever there began to be need of legal
provision for the maintenance of the poor, there must immediately have been need also of some
particular legal provision in behalf of poor children for their education, this not being included
in what we call their maintenance."

  [65] Bishop Butler is here answering the objections of some "people who
  speak of charity schools as a new-invented scheme, and therefore to be
  looked upon with suspicion; whereas it is no otherwise new than as the
  occasion for it is so."

Not only is it the duty of society to provide food for the minds as well as sustenance for
the bodies of poor children, but their pecuniary interests equally require it; for, as Butler
remarks, "if they are not trained up in the way they should go, they will certainly be trained
up in the way they should not go, and in all probability will persevere in it, and become miserable
themselves and mischievous to society, which, in event, is worse, upon account of both, than
if they had been exposed to perish in their infancy." I might elucidate this subject by illustrations.

It has been estimated that a quarter of a million of dollars has been expended in the county
of Philadelphia since 1836 for the suppression of riots occurring within its limits, and in
damages occasioned by their outrages and violence, to say nothing of personal injuries and
deaths arising from the same cause. Now it will be readily conceded by most persons that half
of this sum judiciously expended in organizing and supporting a sufficient police, and in giving
the leaders and gangs engaged in those riots an early and suitable education, whereby they
would have been taught to think, and feel, and act as rational, moral, and accountable beings,
would have prevented the commission of such crimes, together with the sufferings and losses
resulting therefrom, and the reproach thus brought upon public and individual character.

Again: The whole number of paupers relieved or supported by public charity in the single state
of New York, in the year 1849, according to an authentic statement now before me, was, in round
numbers, one hundred thousand, and the entire expense of their support during the year was
eight hundred and seven thousand dollars, a sum exceeding by three hundred and forty thousand
dollars the amount paid on rate-bills for teacher's wages for educating the seven hundred thousand
children of that great state! Of fifty thousand of these paupers, the causes of whose destitution
have been ascertained, nearly twenty thousand are attributable, directly or indirectly, to
intemperance, profligacy, licentiousness, and crime! Had even half the amount that is now expended
from year to year in their support been judiciously bestowed upon their early mental and moral
culture, who can question that, instead of now being a tax upon the communities in which they
reside, and a burden to themselves and a grief to their friends, they would not only have provided
for their own maintenance, but would have contributed their due proportion to increase the
general prosperity of the state.

Great as is her poor-tax, New York contributes annually an immensely greater sum for the support
of her criminal police; for the erection of court-houses, and jails, and penitentiaries, and
houses of correction; for the arrest, trial, conviction, and punishment of criminals, and for
their support in prison and at the various landing-places on their way to the gallows and to
a premature and ignominious death. Now, had one half of the money which this state has expended
in these two ways been judiciously bestowed in the early education of these unfortunate persons,
who can question that the poor and criminal taxes of that state would have been reduced to
less than one tenth of what they now are, to say nothing of the fountains of tears that would
be thus dried up, and of the untold happiness that would be enjoyed by persons who, in every
generation, lead cheerless lives and die ignoble deaths.

Lest some persons may labor under an erroneous impression in relation to this subject, I will
give the statistics of education and crime in New York, as derived from official reports, for
the last few years. Of 1122 persons--the whole number reported by the sheriffs of the different
counties of the state as under conviction and punishment for crime during the year 1847--22
only had a common education, 10 only had a tolerably good education, and only 6 were well educated.
Of the 1345 criminals so returned in the several counties of the state for the year 1848, 23
only had a common school education, 13 only had a tolerably good education, and only 10 were
considered well educated! The returns for other years give like results. Had the whole eleven
or thirteen hundred of these convicts been well educated instead of only six or ten--and the
moral and religious education of even these was defective--how many of them would society be
called upon to support in prisons and penitentiaries? In all probability, as we shall hereafter,
I hope, be able to show, NOT ONE. And what is true of the city and county of Philadelphia and
of the State of New York, will apply to other cities, counties, and states of this Union.

Once more, and finally: Education, as we have already seen, enables men to subdue their passions,
and to improve themselves in the exercise of all the social virtues. Especially have we seen
that the educated portions of community, whose moral culture has been duly attended to, are
habitually temperate, while the appetite of the uncultivated for intoxicating drinks is stronger,
and their power of resistance less. Cut off from the sources of enjoyment which are ever open
to those whose minds and hearts are cultivated, no wonder they seek for happiness in the gratification
of appetite! No wonder that forty thousand of the citizens of the United States annually die
drunkards, when we consider that this is only one in twenty of the number who are unable to
read and write!

The Hon. Edward Everett has expressed the opinion that the expenses of the manufacture and
traffic of intoxicating drinks in the United States exceed annually one hundred and fifty millions
of dollars. General Cary, in alluding to this statement, says, "This, it is believed, is but
an approximation to the cost of these trades to the people. This estimate does not include
the money paid by consumers, which is worse than thrown away. An English writer, well versed
in statistics, and having access to the most reliable sources of information, says that 'the
strong drinks consumed in England alone cost nearly four hundred millions of dollars annually.'
The expenditure for these sources of all evil in the United States must be equal, at least,
to that of England."[66] Now one half of this sum would maintain a system of common schools
in every state of this Union equal in expense and efficiency to that of Massachusetts or New York.

  [66] See Tract on "The Liquor Manufacture and Traffic," prepared by
  request of the National Division of the Sons of Temperance, by S. F.
  Cary, Most Worthy Patriarch.

But I need not extend these observations. Enough, I trust, has been said to show that every
thing connected with the good of man and the welfare of the race depends upon the attention
we bestow in perfecting our systems of public instruction and rendering their blessings universal.
I will therefore close what I have to say upon this topic with a summary of the conclusions
we have arrived at in the progress of the last two chapters. Yes, a system of popular education
adequate to the requirements of the states of this Union will do all this. None, then, it would
seem, can fail to see that true state policy requires the maintenance of improved free schools,
good enough for the best, and cheap enough for the poorest, which are a necessary means of
universal education.

CHAPTER X.

THE MEANS OF UNIVERSAL EDUCATION.

    I would recommend that each state should raise a school fund
    sufficient for the entire support of the schools; that a suitable
    school-house and apparatus, with a convenient dwelling-house for the
    teacher, be furnished by the state for each district; and that every
    school-house be supplied with a well-qualified teacher, who shall
    receive from the state a suitable compensation.--JOHN DUER.

    Let there be an educational department of the government, and let
    its details be managed by proper officers, accountable to the
    representatives of the people.--DR. HAWKS.

We have already considered the nature of education, which has reference to the whole man and
to the whole duration of his being. We have seen its importance to individuals and families,
to neighborhoods and communities, to states and nations, and that in proportion as it receives
attention in any community, will that community become prosperous and happy. We may then very
properly inquire after the means to be put in requisition in order to render the blessings
of education universal among us. To the consideration of this subject we shall devote the remainder
of this work. My first remark is, that

A correct public opinion should be formed. In the language of Bishop Potter, "Our people have
absolutely the control over the whole subject of education, not only as it respects their own
families, but, to a great extent, in schools and seminaries of learning. If, then, the people
were fully awake to its importance and true nature, we should soon have a perfect system, and
we should witness results from it for which we now look in vain."

The formation of a correct public opinion is of the utmost importance, for the primary cause
of all the defects complained of in education, and the source of all the evils that afflict
the community in consequence of its neglect, is popular indifference. From this we have more
to fear than from all other causes combined. Opposition elicits discussion; and discussion,
judiciously conducted, evolves truth; and educational truths brought clearly before the mind
of any community will ultimately induce right action. Men may at first be influenced by a comparatively
low class of motives, but one which they can appreciate. As they witness the beneficial effects
of reform, their motives will gradually become more elevated, and their efforts at improvement
more constant; but no important advance can be made without popular enlightenment.

When the majority of the individuals that compose any community come to value education as
they ought; when they duly estimate its importance in the various points of view already considered,
then will their public servants take more pains to co-operate with them in rendering its blessings
universal. Good laws are important as a means of improving our systems of public instruction;
but good laws, unsustained by a correct public opinion, will be of no avail. Before any considerable
advance can be made either in improving our schools or in causing the attendance upon them
to become more general, a good common education--one that shall give us sound minds in sound
bodies; one that bestows much attention upon intellectual culture, but more upon the culture
of the heart--must come to be ranked among the necessaries of life.

Conventions of the friends of education have already done much to correct popular errors in
relation to this subject, and have contributed largely to the formation of sound and rational
views in relation to its importance in the communities where they have been held. In many instances,
however, they have been composed too exclusively of teachers. These should, indeed, be in attendance;
but to increase the usefulness of such conventions, and heighten the effect they may be made
to produce upon the popular mind, there should also be in attendance members of the several
learned professions, statesmen, capitalists, and all the leading minds of the communities in
which they are held. In some portions of the country this is now the case, but such instances,
I regret to say, are not yet very common among us.

Fourth of July common school celebrations have, within the past few years, become quite common
in several states of the Union. This seems peculiarly appropriate, being a practical recognition
of the importance of primary schools and universal education in a civil and political point
of view. One of the most befitting celebrations of this day which I have ever known was held
in Boston eight years ago, when an oration was delivered before the authorities of that city
by the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education. The theme of the orator was the importance
of national or universal education in a free government as the interest which underlies all
others, and as constituting the only means of perfecting and perpetuating to the latest generations
the institutions we have received from our fathers, and "a demonstration that our existing
means for the promotion of intelligence and virtue are wholly inadequate to the support of
a republican government." Such celebrations should be held in every state of this Union, at
every recurring anniversary of our national independence, until there can not be found a single
individual in all our borders who does not know both his duties and his privileges as a freeman,
and who has not virtue enough faithfully to perform the one and temperately to enjoy the other.

The twenty-second of February has also been observed, to some extent, in several of the states,
by holding such celebrations. Nothing can be more appropriate than these efforts to arouse
the popular mind to renewed efforts to improve the common schools of the land, when we consider
the import of that portion of the Farewell Address of him, the anniversary of whose birth we
celebrate, which relates to popular education. There can be no doubt that WASHINGTON here refers
to the maintenance and improvement of common schools as the means of universal education.

The necessity of improving our common schools and of opening wide their doors to all our youth
should not only be the theme at school celebrations, at educational conventions, and on the
occasion of our national anniversaries, but it should be frequently presented by the civilian
and the divine, as well as by the legislator and the journalist, until men generally well understand
the importance of education, and are willing to make any sacrifices that may be necessary to
secure its advantages to their own children not only, but to all our youth.

PROVISIONS FOR THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS.--The provisions which have been made for the support
of schools may be reduced to three kinds: first, by means of funds; second, by taxation; third,
by a combination of both of these methods.

Connecticut, which has a school fund of more than two millions of dollars, long ago adopted
the first plan named. But the inefficiency of her system of public instruction, until within
a few years, is proverbial, and affords conclusive evidence that a large school fund is of
little or no avail in the absence of a correct public opinion and a due appreciation of the
importance of education. The improvements in the schools of that state during the last few
years are not in consequence of any increase in her school fund, but because the importance
of the subject has been so frequently and impressively presented before the public mind, by
means of lectures, public discussions, educational tracts, school journals, and in various
other ways, as to overcome that popular indifference which had well-nigh precluded all advance.
The late improvements in that state have taken place in spite of the school fund rather than
because of any aid derived from it. Dr. Wayland has expressed the opinion that school "funds
are valuable as a condiment, not as an aliment; and that they should never be so large as to
render any considerable degree of personal effort on the part of the parent unnecessary." This
is true only when a fund is so far relied upon as to slacken personal effort for the improvement
of the schools, and to induce parental and popular indifference in relation to them.

The second plan is by taxation, and Massachusetts furnishes an example of it. In most of the
counties of this state there are small local funds, the avails of which are added to the amount
raised by tax for the support of schools. There are also still less amounts appropriated from
the income of the surplus revenue for the purpose of increasing the educational advantages
of the children; not to be subtracted from, but to be added to, what the towns would otherwise
grant. We may, then, consider the school fund of this state as embracing the entire taxable
property of the state, from which such a sum is annually raised by tax as is necessary for
the support of the schools. In Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, the schools are supported
essentially as in Massachusetts, the difference being chiefly in the mode of taxation.

Dr. Wayland, in a letter written some years ago, makes the following remark in relation to
the support of schools: "The best legislative provision with which I am acquainted is that
of Maine. They have no fund whatever, but oblige every district to raise for education a sum
proportioned to the number of its inhabitants or its property. If a town or a district neglects
to do this, it is liable to a fine."

In those states whose systems of public instruction are best administered--which have the best
schools, and the greatest proportion of the population in attendance upon them--the schools
are generally supported almost entirely by a direct tax, the great principle that THE PROPERTY
OF THE STATE SHOULD EDUCATE THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE being practically recognized. It not
only appears, then, that large funds are not required for the successful administration of
systems of public instruction, but that actually the best schools, and those which are doing
most for the correct education of the rising generation, may be found in those states that
are destitute of funds, and whose public schools are supported by a direct tax upon the property
of the state.

The third plan of supporting schools is a combination of both of the others. New York until
within the last year,[67] Rhode Island, and Michigan may be cited as examples of this plan.
Where this plan has been adopted, the districts or townships have generally been required to
raise by tax an amount equal to or greater than what has been received from the school fund.
Where the expense of supporting the schools has exceeded the whole fund derived from both sources,
the balance of the expense has generally been made up by a rate-bill, parents who are able
being required to pay in proportion to the number of days their children have attended school.
This feature is objectionable even where provision is made for the children of poor parents
to attend without charge, for it offers a pecuniary inducement, although the schools be nearly
free, to withdraw scholars from attendance upon them for the slightest causes. This plan has
obtained very generally in the states northwest of the Ohio River, which have received from
the General Confederacy a grant of one section, or six hundred and forty acres of land in each
township for the support of schools. In some of these states the additional tax is already
sufficient, when joined with the avails of the school fund, to render the schools entirely
free. If one plan is superior to both of the others, this is, perhaps, entitled to the pre-eminence.
The school fund lessens the amount which it is necessary to raise by a direct tax; and still
the sum which is levied in this way has a tendency to beget and maintain a lively interest
on the part of capitalists in the administration of the educational department, and in the
maintenance and improvement of the public schools.

  [67] A year ago the schools of New York were made entirely free by law.
  See the foot-note on the 267th page of this work.

Without a correct public opinion and a due appreciation of the importance of education, either
of the three systems named, or any other which may be adopted for the support of schools, will,
and, from the very nature of the case, must, be inadequate to meet the necessities of a free
people. But let the public be alive to the advantages of education, and rank it first among
the necessaries of life, and almost any system will be attended with eminent success. If, then,
one system is superior to all others, it is that which is best calculated to beget in the popular
mind a realizing sense of the necessity of educating all our youth in good schools. If this
can be done in a state which has a large school fund, without diminishing the interest of the
people in education, or relaxing their efforts to maintain improved schools, then may such
a fund prove serviceable, as it will lessen the general tax. But if the citizens of any state
can not be brought to realize the importance of maintaining an elevated standard of common
school education, and of rendering its blessings universal, without defraying the whole expense
by a direct tax, then will a school fund prove to them a curse, and not a blessing.

Where there is a will there is a way, says the adage. In this recommendation I fully concur.
But with me it is immaterial whether the state raises a separate fund, set apart exclusively
for the purposes of education, or regards the entire taxable property of the commonwealth,
personal and real, as a general fund from which there shall be drawn annually a sufficient
per centage to provide for universal education in free schools. This only do I insist upon,
that the people be brought so fully to realize the advantages of a good common education as
to place it high on the list of indispensables; then will they provide for rendering its blessings
universal. The mode of doing this in any one state may, in view of the peculiar circumstances
of a people, be different from that which it would be most advantageous ordinarily to adopt.
If there is no other sure way of meeting the expense of common schools, and of begetting and
maintaining a deep and abiding interest in popular education, then let the property of the
state be regarded as a common fund from which there shall be annually drawn a sum sufficient
for the maintenance of improved free schools, in which every child may receive a generous education,
as this is the interest first in importance to individuals and families, to neighborhoods and
communities, to states and nations.

The state should maintain an Educational Department. The magnitude of the interests involved
renders this of the utmost importance. At the head of this department in every state there
should be a minister of public instruction--whether he is called school superintendent, school
commissioner, secretary of the board of education, or superintendent of public instruction--and
he should be allowed time to make himself familiar with all the leading writers on the subject
of education, in whatever age or language their works may have been written. Such an officer
can not in any other way become qualified for the proper discharge of the duties which pertain
to his profession. He should also be allowed time to acquaint himself with the current literature
belonging to his department as it emanates from the press; to examine new school-books, and
new kinds of school apparatus which claim to possess advantages, that he may be prepared to
give to school teachers, school committee-men, and others whose opportunities for examination
and investigation are less extended, and many of whom must be inexperienced, such advice as
shall enable them judiciously to expend their means for their personal improvement or the improvement
of their schools. He should likewise have time and opportunity to become so conversant with
the practical operations of different school systems as to be qualified to give such suggestions
in official reports as may be of service to the Legislature in perfecting their own, and to
subordinate officers in its successful administration. All this would be necessary were we
only to consult the pecuniary interests of the state in the judicious expenditure of the means
which are annually devoted to the support of common schools. Of how much greater importance
is it that there should be such an officer in every state, and that he should enjoy every possible
means for increasing his usefulness, when we consider that the successful bestowment of his
labors will contribute greatly to increase individual and social happiness, and the general
prosperity of the state in all coming generations.

In the further consideration of the means of rendering the blessings of education universal,
we shall introduce leading topics in the order in which they naturally suggest themselves.

GOOD SCHOOL HOUSES SHOULD BE PROVIDED.

    A school ought to be a noble asylum, to which children will come,
    and in which they will remain with pleasure; to which their parents
    will send them with good will.--COUSIN.

    If there is one house in the district more pleasantly located, more
    comfortably constructed, better warmed, more inviting in its general
    appearance, and more elevating in its influence than any other, that
    house should be the school-house.--Michigan School Report, 1847.

In considering the means of improving our schools, the place where our country's youth receive
their first instruction, and where nineteen twentieths of them complete their scholastic training,
claims early attention. It is, then, proper to consider the condition of this class of edifices,
as they have almost universally been in every part of the United States until within a few
years past, and as they now generally are out of those states in which public attention has
of late been more especially directed to improvements in education; for, before any people
will attempt a reform in this particular, they must see and feel the need of it. Even in the
more favored states, comparatively few in number, the improvements in school architecture have
been confined mostly to a few localities, and are far from being adequate to the necessities
of the case. Did space allow, I would present statements made by school officers in their reports
from various states of the Union: for, however wide the differences may be in common usage,
in other respects there has heretofore been a striking sameness in the appearance of school-houses
in every part of the country.

CONDITION OF SCHOOL-HOUSES.--In remarking upon the condition of this class of edifices, as
they have heretofore been constructed, and as they are now almost universally found wherever
public sentiment has not been earnestly, perseveringly, and judiciously called to their improvement,
I will present a few extracts from the official reports of Massachusetts and New York, where
greater pains have been taken to ascertain existing defects in schools, with a view to providing
the necessary remedies, than in any other two states of this Union.

School-houses in Massachusetts.--The Secretary of the Board of Education of this state, in
his report for 1846, remarks in reference to the condition of school-houses in the commonwealth
as follows: "For years the condition of this class of edifices throughout the state, taken
as a whole, had been growing worse and worse. Time and decay were always doing their work,
while only here and there, with wide spaces between, was any notice taken of their silent ravages;
and, in still fewer instances, were these ravages repaired. Hence, notwithstanding the improved
condition of all other classes of buildings, general dilapidation was the fate of these. Industry,
and the increasing pecuniary ability which it creates, had given comfort, neatness, and even
elegance to private dwellings. Public spirit had erected commodious and costly churches. Counties,
though largely taxed, had yet uncomplainingly paid for handsome and spacious court-houses and
public offices. Humanity had been at work, and had made generous and noble provision for the
pauper, the blind, the deaf and dumb, the insane. Even jails and houses of correction--the
receptacles of felons and other offenders against the laws of God and man--had in many instances
been transformed, by the more enlightened spirit of the age, into comfortable and healthful
residences. The Genius of Architecture, as if she had made provision for all mankind, extended
her sheltering care over the brute creation. Better stables were provided for cattle; better
folds for sheep; and even the unclean beasts felt the improving hand of reform. But, in the
mean while, the school-houses, to which the children should have been wooed by every attraction,
were suffered to go where age and the elements would carry them.

"In 1837, not one third of the public school-houses in Massachusetts would have been considered
tenantable by any decent family out of the poor-house or in it. As an inducement to neatness
and decency, children were sent to a house whose walls and floors were indeed painted, but
they were painted all too thickly by smoke and filth; whose benches and doors were covered
with carved work, but they were the gross and obscene carvings of impure hands; whose vestibule,
after the Oriental fashion, was converted into a veranda, but the metamorphosis which changed
its architectural style consisted in laying it bare of its outer covering. The modesty and
chastity of the sexes, at their tenderest age, were to be cultivated and cherished in places
which oftentimes were as destitute of all suitable accommodation as a camp or a caravan. The
brain was to be worked amid gases that stupefied it. The virtues of generosity and forbearance
were to be acquired where sharp discomfort and pain tempt each one to seize more than his own
share of relief, and thus to strengthen every selfish propensity.

"At the time referred to, the school-houses in Massachusetts were an opprobrium to the state;
and if there be any one who thinks this expression too strong, he may satisfy himself of its
correctness by inspecting some of the few specimens of them which still remain.

"The earliest effort at reform was directed to this class of buildings. By presenting the idea
of taxation, this measure encountered the opposition of one of the strongest passions of the
age. Not only the sordid and avaricious, but even those whose virtue of frugality, by the force
of habit, had been imperceptibly sliding into the vice of parsimony, felt the alarm. Men of
fortune without children, and men who had reared a family of children and borne the expenses
of their education, fancied they saw something of injustice in being called to pay for the
education of others, and too often their fancies started into specters of all imaginable oppression
and wrong.

"During the five years immediately succeeding the report made by the Board of Education to
the Legislature on the subject of school-houses, the sums expended for the erection and repair
of this class of buildings fell but little short of seven hundred thousand dollars. Since that
time, from the best information obtained, I suppose the sum expended on this one item to be
about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars annually. Every year adds some new improvement
to the construction and arrangement of these edifices.

"In regard to this great change in school-houses--it would hardly be too much to call it a
revolution--the school committees have done an excellent work, or, rather, they have begun
it; it is not yet done. Their annual reports, read in open town meeting, or printed and circulated
among the inhabitants, afterward embodied in the Abstracts and distributed to the members of
the government, to all town and school committees, have enlightened and convinced the state."

School-houses in New York.--About ten years ago, special visitors were appointed by the superintendent
of common schools in each of the counties of this state, who were requested to visit and inspect
the schools, and to report minutely in regard to their state and prospects. The most respectable
citizens, without distinction of party, were selected to discharge this duty; and the result
of their labors is contained in two reports, made, the one in April, 1840, the other in February,
1841. "It may be remarked, generally," say the visitors of one of the oldest and most affluent
towns of the southeastern section of the state, "that the school-houses are built in the old
style, are too small to be convenient, and, with one exception, too near the public roads,
having generally no other play-ground."--Report, 1840, p. 47.

Say the visitors of another large and wealthy town in the central part of the state, "Out of
twenty schools visited, ten of the school-houses were in bad repair, and many of them not worth
repairing. In none were any means provided for the ventilation of the room. In many of the
districts, the school-rooms are too small for the number of scholars. The location of the school-houses
is generally pleasant. There are, however, but few instances where play-grounds are attached,
and their condition as to privies is very bad. The arrangement of seats and desks is generally
very bad, and inconvenient to both scholars and teachers; most of them are without backs."--Report,
1840, p. 28.

In another large and populous town in the northwestern part of the state, it appears from the
report of the visitors that only five out of twenty-two school-houses are respectable or comfortable;
none have any proper means of ventilation; eight of them are built of logs, and but one of
them has a privy.

According to the report from another county, where the evils already enumerated exist, "There
is, in general, too little attention to having good and dry wood provided, or a good supply
of any; or to have a wood-house or shelter to keep it from the storm." This neglect is very
common. Another neglect, noticed by many of the visitors, is "the cold and comfortless state
in which the children find the school-room, owing to the late hour at which the fire is first
made in the morning."

Three years later--and after the appointment of county superintendents in each of the counties
of that state, who collected statistics with great care--the Hon. Samuel Young, then state
superintendent, after making a minute statement of the number of school-houses constructed
of stone, brick, wood, and logs; of their condition as to repair; of the destitution of privies,
suitable play-grounds, etc., remarked as follows:

"But 544 out of 9368 houses visited contained more than one room; 7313 were destitute of any
suitable play-ground; nearly 6000 were unfurnished with convenient seats and desks; nearly
8000 destitute of the proper facilities for ventilation; and upward of 6000 without a privy
of any sort; while, of the remainder, but about 1000 were provided with privies containing
different apartments for male and female pupils! And it is in these miserable abodes of accumulated
dirt and filth, deprived of wholesome air, or exposed, without adequate protection, to the
assaults of the elements; with no facilities for necessary exercise or relaxation; no convenience
for prosecuting their studies; crowded together on benches not admitting of a moment's rest
in any position, and debarred the possibility of yielding to the ordinary calls of nature without
violent inroads upon modesty and shame, that upward of two hundred thousand children, scattered
over various parts of the state, are compelled to spend an average period of eight months during
each year of their pupilage! Here the first lessons of human life, the incipient principles
of morality, and the rules of social intercourse are to be impressed upon the plastic mind.
The boy is here to receive the model of his permanent character, and to imbibe the elements
of his future career; and here the instinctive delicacy of the young female, one of the characteristic
ornaments of the sex, is to be expanded into maturity by precept and example! Is it strange,
under such circumstances, that an early and invincible repugnance to the acquisition of knowledge
is imbibed by the youthful mind? that the school-house is regarded with unconcealed aversion
and disgust, and that parents who have any desire to preserve the health and the morals of
their children exclude them from the district school, and provide instruction for them elsewhere?"

A volume might be filled with similar testimony; but one more quotation from another state
must suffice. After noticing the common evils already referred to, the superintendent remarks
as follows:[68] "But this notice of ordinary deficiencies does not cover the whole ground of
error in regard to the situation of school-houses. In some cases they are brought into close
connection with positive nuisances. In a case which has fallen under the superintendent's own
personal observation, one side of the school-house forms part of the fence of a hog-yard, into
which, during the summer, the calves of an extensive dairy establishment have been thrown from
time to time (disgusting and revolting spectacle!), to be rent and devoured before the eyes
of teacher and pupils, except such portions of the mutilated and mangled carcasses as were
left by the animals to go to decay, as they lay exposed to the sun and storm. It is true, the
windows on the side of the building adjoining the yard were generally observed to be closed,
in order to shut out the almost insupportable stench which arose from the decomposing remains.
But this closure of the windows could, in no great degree, 'abate the nuisance;' for not a
breath of air could enter the house from any direction but it must come saturated with the
disgusting and sickening odor that loaded the atmosphere around. It needs no professional learning
to tell the deleterious influence upon health which must be exerted by such an agency, operating
for continuous hours."

  [68] First Annual Report of the State Superintendent (Hon. Horace Eaton)
  of Common Schools, made to the Legislature of Vermont, October, 1846.

If such evils as have been considered have existed so generally, and still prevail to an alarming
extent, even in the states where education has received the most attention, what need must
there be for the dissemination of information on this vitally important subject, especially
in those states where education has heretofore received less attention! In remarking further
upon this subject, I shall consider several leading particulars in the order they naturally
suggest themselves. I will, then, commence with the

LOCATION OF SCHOOL-HOUSES.--In comparatively few instances school-houses are favorably located,
being situated on dry, hard ground, in a retired though central part of the district, in the
midst of a natural or artificial grove. But they are almost universally badly located; exposed
to the noise, dust, and danger of the highway; unattractive, if not absolutely repulsive in
their external appearance, and built at the least possible expense of material and labor. They
are generally on one corner of public roads, and sometimes adjacent to a cooper's shop, or
between a blacksmith's shop and a saw-mill. They are not unfrequently placed on an acute angle,
where a road forks, and sometimes in turning that angle, the travel is chiefly behind the school-house,
leaving it on a small triangle bounded on all sides by public roads.

Occasionally the school-house is situated on a low and worthless piece of ground, with a sluggish
stream of water in its vicinity, which sometimes even passes under the house. The comfort,
and health even, of children are thus sacrificed to the parsimony of their parents. Scholars
very generally step from the school-house directly into the highway. Indeed, school-houses
are frequently situated one half in the highway and the other half in the adjacent field, as
though they were unfit for either. This is the case even in some of the principal villages
of all the states I have ever visited, or from which I have read full reports on the subject.

Strange as it may seem, school-houses are sometimes situated in the middle of the highway,
a portion of the travel being on each side of them. When the scholars are engaged in their
recreations, they are exposed to bleak winds and the inclemency of the weather one portion
of the year, and to the scorching rays of the meridian sun another portion. Moreover, their
recreations must be conducted in the street, or they trespass upon their neighbors' premises.
We pursue a very different policy in locating a church, a court-house, or a dwelling; and should
we not pursue an equally wise and liberal policy in locating the district school-house?

In the states generally northwest of the River Ohio, six hundred and forty acres of land in
every township are appropriated to the support of common schools. Suppose there are ten school
districts in a township, this would allow sixty-four acres to every district. It would seem
that when the general government has appropriated sixty-four acres to create a fund for the
encouragement of the schools of a township, that each district might set apart one acre as
a site for a school-house. Once more: school districts usually contain not less than twenty-five
hundred acres of land. Is it, then, asking too much to set apart one acre as a site for a school-house,
in which the minds of the children of the district shall be cultivated, when twenty-four hundred
and ninety-nine acres are appropriated to feeding and clothing their bodies?

I would respectfully suggest, and even urge the propriety of locating the school-house on a
piece of firm ground of liberal dimensions, and of inclosing the same with a suitable fence.
The location should be dry, quiet, and pleasant, and in every respect healthy. The vicinity
of places of idle and dissipated resort should by all means be avoided; and, if possible, the
site of the school-house should overlook a delightful country, and be surrounded by picturesque
scenery. The school yard, at least, should be inclosed not only, but set out with shade trees,
unless provided with those of Nature's own planting. It should also be ornamented with beautiful
shrubbery, and be made the park of the neighborhood--the pleasantest place for resort within
the boundaries of the district. This would contribute largely to the formation of a correct
taste on the part of both children and parents. It would also tend to the formation of virtuous
habits and the cultivation of self-respect; for the scholars would then enjoy their pastime
in a pleasant and healthful yard, where they have a right to be, and need no longer be hunted
as trespassers upon their neighbors' premises, as they now too frequently are. The average
attendance in houses of these dimensions was estimated at forty-five scholars in the winter.
Now, to say nothing of the inconvenience which so many persons must experience in occupying
a house of so narrow dimensions, and making no allowance for the space taken up by desks, furniture,
and the scholars themselves, a simple arithmetical computation will show any one that such
a room will not contain a sufficient amount of air for the support of life three hours. But
I will here simply refer the reader to the fourth chapter of this work, and will not repeat
what was there said.

In determining the size of school-houses, due regard should be had to several particulars.
There should be a separate entry or lobby for each sex, which Mr. Barnard, in his School Architecture,[69]
very justly says should be furnished with a scraper, mat, hooks or shelves--both are needed--sink,
basin, and towels. A separate entry thus furnished will prevent much confusion, rudeness, and
impropriety, and promote the health, refinement, and orderly habits of the children.

  [69] "School Architecture," or Contributions to the Improvement of
  School-houses in the United States, by Henry Barnard, Commissioner of
  Public Schools in Rhode Island, p. 383. This excellent treatise embodies
  a mass of most valuable information in relation to school-houses and
  apparatus. It contains the plans of a great number of the best
  school-houses in various portions of the United States, and should be
  consulted by every committee before determining upon a plan for the
  construction of a valuable school-house.

The principal room of the school-house, and each such room where there are several departments,
should be large enough to allow each occupant a suitable quantity of pure air, which should
be at least twice the common amount, or not less than one hundred and fifty cubic feet. There
should also be one or more rooms for recitation, apparatus, library, etc., according to the
size of the school and the number of scholars to be accommodated.

Every school-room should be so constructed that each scholar may pass to and from his seat
without disturbing or in the least incommoding any other one. A house thus arranged will enable
the teacher to pass at all times to any part of the room, and to approach each scholar in his
seat whenever it may be desirable to do so for purposes of instruction or otherwise. Such an
arrangement is of the utmost importance; and without the fulfillment of this condition, no
teacher can most advantageously superintend the affairs of a whole school, and especially of
a large one.

In determining the details of construction and arrangement for a school-house, due regard must
be had to the varying circumstances of country and city, as well as to the number of scholars
that may be expected in attendance, the number of teachers to be employed, and the different
grades of schools that may be established in a community.

COUNTRY DISTRICTS.--In country districts, as they have long been situated, and still generally
are, aside from separate entries and clothes-rooms for the sexes, there will only be needed
one principal school-room, with a smaller room for recitations, apparatus, and other purposes.
In arranging and fitting up this room, reference must be had to the requirements of the district;
for this one room is to be occupied by children of all ages, for summer and winter schools,
and for the secular, but more especially for the religious meetings of the neighborhood. But
in its construction primary reference should be had to the convenience of the scholars in school,
for it will be used by them more, ten to one, than for all other purposes. Every child, then,
even the youngest in school, should be furnished with a seat and desk, at which he may sit
with ease and comfort. The seats should each be furnished with a back, and their height should
be such as to allow the children to rest their feet comfortably upon the floor. The necessity
of this will be apparent by referring to what has been said on the laws of health in the third
chapter of this work, at the 68th and following pages.

No one, then, can fail to see the advantages that would result to a densely-settled community
from a union of two or more districts for the purpose of maintaining in each a school for the
younger children, and of establishing in the central part of the associated districts a school
of a higher grade for the older and more advanced children of all the districts thus united.
If four districts should be united in this way, they might erect a central house, C, for the
larger and more advanced scholars, and four smaller ones, P P P P, for the younger children.
The central school might be taught by a male teacher, with female assistants, if needed; but
the primary schools, with this arrangement, could be more economically and successfully instructed
by females. In several of the states legal provisions are already made for such a consolidation
of districts. This would invite a more perfect classification of scholars, and would allow
the central school-house to be so constructed, and to have the seats and desks of such a height
as to be convenient for the larger grade of scholars, and still be comfortable for other purposes
for which it might occasionally be necessary to occupy it. Such an arrangement, while it would
obviate the almost insuperable difficulties which stand in the way of proper classification
and the thorough government and instruction of schools, would at the same time offer greater
inducements to the erection of more comfortable and attractive school-houses.

CITIES AND VILLAGES.--The plan suggested in the last paragraph may be perfected in cities and
villages. For this purpose, where neither the distance nor the number of scholars is too great,
some prefer to have all the schools of a district or corporation conducted under the same roof.
However this may be, as there will be other places for public meetings of various kinds, each
room should be appropriated to a particular department, and be fitted up exclusively for the
accommodation of the grade of scholars that are to occupy it. In cities, and even in villages
with a population of three or four thousand, it is desirable to establish at least three grades
of schools, viz., first, the primary, for the smallest children; second, the intermediate,
for those more advanced; and, third, a central high school, for scholars that have passed through
the primary and intermediate schools. While this arrangement is favorable to the better classification
of the scholars of a village or city, and holds out an inducement to those of the lowest and
middle grade of schools to perfect themselves in the various branches of study that are pursued
in them respectively as the condition upon which they are permitted to enter a higher grade,
it also allows a more perfect adjustment of the seats and desks to the various requirements
of the children in their passage through the grade of schools.

NEW YORK FREE ACADEMY.--In the public schools of the city of New York, two hundred in number,
six hundred teachers are employed, and one hundred thousand children annually receive instruction.
The Free Academy, which is a public school of the highest grade, and which is represented in
our frontispiece, was established by the Board of Education in 1847. The expense of the building,
without the furniture, was $46,000, and the annual expense for the salaries of professors and
teachers is about $10,000. Out of twenty-four thousand votes cast, twenty thousand were for
the establishment of this institution, in which essentially a complete collegiate education
may be obtained. No students are admitted to it who have not attended the public schools of
the city for at least one full year, nor these until they have undergone a thorough examination
and proved themselves worthy. Its influence is not confined to the one hundred or one hundred
and fifty scholars who may graduate from it annually, but leaches and stimulates the six hundred
teachers, and the hundred thousand children whom they instruct, and thus elevates the common
schools of the city in reality not only, but places them much more favorably before the public
than they otherwise could be.

Smaller cities, and especially villages with a population of but a few thousand, can not, of
course, maintain so extended a system of public schools; but they can accomplish essentially
the same thing more perfectly, though on a smaller scale. For the benefit of districts in the
country and in villages, I will here insert a few plans of school-houses.

    D D, doors. E E, entries lighted over outer doors, one for the boys
    and the other for the girls. T, teacher's platform and desk. R L,
    room for recitation, library, and apparatus, which may be entered by
    a single door, as represented in the plan, or by two, as in the
    following plan. S S, stoves with air-tubes beneath. K K, aisles four
    feet wide--the remaining aisles are each two feet wide. c v,
    chimneys and ventilators. I I, recitation seats. B B, black-board,
    made by giving the wall a colored hard finish. G H, seats and desks,
    four feet in length, constructed as represented on the next page.
    The seat and desk may be made together, and instead of being
    fastened permanently to the floor, attached in front by a strap
    hinge, which will admit of their being turned forward while sweeping
    under and behind them.

    A, entrance for boys to the High School. C, entrance for girls to
    the High School. P, entrance for boys to the Primary and
    Intermediate Departments. Q, entrance for girls to the same. D D,
    doors. W W, windows. T, teacher's platform and desk. G H, desk and
    seat for two scholars, a section of which is represented at X, in
    the Primary Department. I I, recitation seats. B B, black-boards. S
    S, stoves, with air-tubes beneath. c v, chimney and ventilator. R,
    room for recitation library, apparatus, and other purposes.

    A, entrance for the boys, through the entry below. C, entrance for
    the girls. G H, desk and seat: aisles from two to three feet wide. D
    D, doors. W W, windows. S S, stoves. c v, chimney and ventilator.
    T, teacher's platform. R, recitation-room. I I, recitation seats in
    principal room. B B, black-board: as a substitute for the common
    painted board, a portion of the wall, covered with hard finish, may
    be painted black; or, what is better, the hard finish itself may be
    colored before it is put on, by mixing with it lamp-black, wet up
    with alcohol or sour beer. Hence
the necessity of frequent and thorough ventilation.

The ordinary facilities for ventilating school-rooms consist in opening a door and raising
the lower sash of the windows. The only ventilation which has been practiced in the great majority
of schools has been entirely accidental, and has consisted in opening and closing the outer
door as the scholars enter and pass out of the school-house, before school, during the recesses,
and at noon. Ventilation, as such, I may safely say, has not, until within a few years, been
practiced in one school in fifty; nor is it at the present time in many parts of the country.
It is true, the door has at times been set open a few minutes, and the windows have been occasionally
raised, but the object has been either to let the smoke pass out of the room, or to cool it
when it has become too warm, not to ventilate it.

Ventilation by opening a door or raising the windows is imperfect, and frequently injurious.
A more effectual and safer method of ventilation consists in lowering the upper sash of the
window. In very cold or stormy weather, a ventilator in the ceiling may be opened, so as to
allow the vitiated air to escape into the attic, in which case there should be a free communication
between the attic and the outer air by means of a lattice in the gable, or otherwise. A ventilator
may also be constructed in connection with the chimney, by carrying up a partition in the middle,
one half of the chimney being used for a smoke flue, and the other half for a ventilator.

But it is often asked, Why is it not just as well to raise the lower sash of the windows as
to lower the upper one? In reply I would say, first, lowering the upper sash is a more effectual
method of ventilation. In a room which is warmed and occupied in cold weather, the warmer and
more vitiated portions of the air rise to the upper part of the room, while that which is colder
and purer descends. The reason for this may not be readily conceived, especially when we consider
that carbonic acid, the vitiating product of respiration, is specifically heavier than common
air. Three considerations, however, will make it apparent. 1. Gases of different specific gravity
mix uniformly, under favorable circumstances. 2. The carbonic acid which is exhaled from the
lungs at about blood heat is hence rarefied, and specifically lighter than the air in the room,
which inclines it to ascend. 3. The ingress of cold and heavier air from without is chiefly
through apertures near the base of the room. Raising the lower sash of the windows allows a
portion of the purer air of the room to pass off, while the more vitiated air above is retained.
Lowering the upper sash allows the impure air above to escape, while the purer air below remains
unchanged.

Lowering the upper sash is also the safer method of ventilation. It not only allows the impure
air more readily to escape, but provides also for the more uniform diffusion of the pure air
from without, which takes its place through the upper part of the room. The renovated air will
gradually settle upon the heads of the scholars, giving them a purer air to breathe, while
the comfort of the body and lower extremities will remain undisturbed. This is as it should
be; for warm feet and cool heads contribute alike to physical comfort and clearness of mind.
Raising the lower sash of the windows endangers the health of scholars, exposing those who
sit near them to colds, catarrhs, etc. Indeed, when it is very cold or stormy, it is unsafe
to ventilate by lowering the upper sash of the windows. At such times, provision should be
made for the escape of impure air at the upper part of the room, and for the introduction of
pure air at the lower part, as will be shown while treating upon the means of warming.

MEANS OF WARMING.--Next in importance to pure air in a school-room is the maintenance of an
even temperature. This is an indispensable condition of health, comfort, and successful labor.
It is one, however, that is very generally disregarded; or, perhaps I should say, one that
is not often enjoyed. School-houses are generally warmed by means of stoves, some of which
are in a good condition, and supplied with dry, seasoned wood. The instances, however, in which
such facilities for warming exist, are comparatively few. It is much more common to see cracked
and broken stoves, the doors without either hinges or latch, with rusty pipe of various sizes.
Green wood, also, and that which is old and partially decayed, either drenched with rain or
covered with snow during inclement weather, is much more frequently used for fuel than sound,
seasoned wood, protected from the weather by a suitable wood-house. With this state of things,
it is exceedingly difficult to kindle a fire, which burns poorly, at best, when built. Fires,
moreover, are frequently built so late, that the house does not become comfortably warm at
the time appointed for commencing school. These neglects are the fruitful source of much discomfort
and disorder. The temperature is fluctuating; the room is filled with smoke a considerable
part of the time, especially in stormy weather; and the school is liable to frequent interruptions,
in fastening together and tying up stove-pipe, etc., etc.

This may seem a little like exaggeration. I know full well there are many noble exceptions.
But in a large majority of instances some of these inconveniences exist; and the most of them
coexist much more frequently than persons generally are aware of. I speak from the personal
observation of several thousand schools in different states, and from reliable information
in relation to the subject from various portions of the country. I have myself many times heard
trustees and patrons, who have visited their school with me for the first time in several years,
say, "We ought to have some dry wood to kindle with; I didn't know as it was so smoky: we must
get some new pipe; really, our stove is getting dangerous," etc. And some of the boys have
relieved the embarrassment of their parents by saying, "It don't smoke near so bad to-day as
it does sometimes!"

The principal reason why the stoves in our school-houses are so cracked and broken, and why
the pipes are so rusty and open, lies in the circumstance that green wood, or that which is
partially decayed and saturated with moisture, is used for fuel, instead of good seasoned wood,
protected from the inclemency of the weather by a suitable wood-house. There are at least three
reasons why this is poor policy. 1. It takes double the amount of wood. A considerable portion
of the otherwise sensible heat becomes latent, in the conversion of ice, snow, and moisture
into steam. 2. The steam thus generated cracks the stove and rusts the pipe, so that they will
not last one half as long as though dry wood from a wood-house were used. 3. It is impossible
to preserve an even temperature. Sometimes it is too cold, and at other times it is too warm;
and this, with such means of warming, is unavoidable. Scores of teachers have informed me that,
in order to keep their fires from going out, it was necessary to have their stoves constantly
full of wood, and even to lay wood upon the stove, that a portion of it might be seasoning
while the rest was burning. Aside from the inconvenience of a fluctuating temperature, this
is an unseemly and filthy practice, and one that generates very offensive and injurious gases.

Again: I have frequently heard the following and similar remarks: "The use of stoves in our
school-houses is a great evil;" "Stoves are unhealthy in our school-houses, or in any other
houses," etc. This idea being somewhat prevalent, and stoves being generally used in our school-houses,
their influence upon health becomes a proper subject for consideration.

Combustion, whether in a stove or fire-place, consists in a chemical union of the oxygen gas
of the atmosphere with carbon, the combustible part of the wood or coal used for fuel. Carbonic
acid, the vitiating product of combustion, does not, however, ordinarily deteriorate the atmosphere
of the room, but, mingling with the smoke, escapes through the stove-pipe or chimney.

The stove, in point of economy, is far superior to the open fire-place as ordinarily constructed.
When the latter is used, it has been estimated that nine tenths of the heat evolved ascends
the chimney, and only one tenth, or, according to Rumford and Franklin, only one fifteenth,
is radiated from the front of the fire into the room. Four-fold more fuel is required to warm
a room by a fire-place than when a stove is used. Oxygen is, of course, consumed in a like
proportion, and hence, when the open fire-place is used, there is necessarily a four-fold greater
ingress of cold air to supply combustion than where a stove is employed.

And, what is of still greater importance, when a fire-place is used, it is impossible to preserve
so uniform a temperature throughout the room as when a stove is employed. When a fire-place
is used, the cold air is constantly rushing through every crevice at one end of the room to
supply combustion at the other end. Hence the scholars in one part of the room suffer from
cold, while those in the opposite part are oppressed with heat. The stove may be set in a central
part of the room, whence the heat will radiate, not in one direction merely, but in all directions.
In addition to this, as we have already seen, only one fourth as much air is required to sustain
combustion, on both of which accounts a much more even and uniform temperature can be maintained
throughout a room where a stove is used than where a fire-place is employed.

But whence, then, has arisen the prevailing opinion that stoves are unhealthy? There are two
sources of mischief, either of which furnishes a sufficient foundation for this popular fallacy.
The first has already been referred to, and consists simply in the almost total neglect of
proper ventilation. The other lies in the circumstance that school-rooms are generally kept
too warm. In addition to the inconvenience of too high a temperature, the aqueous vapor existing
in the atmosphere in its natural and healthful state is dispersed, and the air of the room
becomes too dry. The evil being seen, the remedy is apparent. Reduce the temperature of the
room to its proper point, and supply the deficiency of aqueous vapor by an evaporating dish
partially filled with pure water. If this is not done, the dry and over-heated air, which is
highly absorbent of moisture in every thing with which it comes in contact, not only creates
a disagreeable sensation of dryness on the surface of the body, but in passing over the delicate
membrane of the throat, creates a tickling, induces a cough, and lays the foundation for pulmonary
disease, especially when ventilation is neglected. The water in the evaporating dish should
be frequently changed, and kept free from dirt and other impurities. Care also should be taken
not to create more moisture than the air naturally contains, otherwise the effect will be positively
injurious.

The evil complained of is attributable mainly to the maintenance of a too high temperature.
Were a thermometer placed in many of our school-rooms--and a school-house should never be without
one in every occupied apartment--instead of indicating a suitable temperature, say sixty-two
or sixty-five degrees, or even a summer temperature, it would not unfrequently rise above blood
heat. The system is thus not only enfeebled and deranged by breathing an infectious atmosphere,
but the debility thence arising is considerably increased in consequence of too high a temperature.
The two causes combined eminently predispose the system to disease. The change from inhaling
a fluid poison at blood heat, to inhaling the purer air without at the freezing point or below,
is greater than the system can bear with impunity.

A uniform temperature, which is highly important, can be more easily and more effectually maintained
where a stove is employed, furnished with a damper, and supplied with dry, hard wood, than
where a fire-place is used. In the former case the draft may be regulated, in the latter it
can not be. A great amount of air enters into combustion even where a stove is used. A greater
quantity enters into the combustion where a fire-place is used, in proportion to the increased
amount of wood consumed. Much of the heated air, also, where an open fire-place is used, mingling
with the smoke, passes off through the chimney, and its place is supplied by an ingress of
cold air at the more distant portions of the room. There is hence not only a great waste of
fuel, but a sacrifice of comfort, health, and life.

But even where a stove is used there is a constant ingress of cold air through cracks and defects
in the floor, doors, windows, and walls, which causes it to be colder in the outer portions
of the room than in the central portions and about the stove. The evil is the same in kind
as that already referred to in speaking of fire-places, but less in degree. This evil, however,
may be almost entirely obviated by a very simple arrangement, which will also do much to render
ventilation at once more effectual and safe, especially in very cold and inclement weather.
The arrangement is as follows:

Immediately beneath the floor--and in case the school-house is two stories high, between the
ceiling and the floor above--insert a tube from four to six inches in diameter, according to
the size of the rooms, the outer end communicating with the external air by means of an orifice
in the under-pinning or wall of the house, and the other, by means of an angle, passing upward
through the floor beneath the stove. This part of the tube should be furnished with a register,
so as to admit much or little air, as may be desirable. This simple arrangement will reverse
the ordinary currents of air in a school-room. The cold air, instead of entering at the crevices
in the outer part of the room, where it is coldest, enters directly beneath the stove, where
it is warmest. It thus moderates the heat immediately about the stove, and being warmed as
it enters, and mingling with the heated air, establishes currents toward the walls, and gradually
finds its way out at the numerous crevices through which the cold air previously entered. If
these are not sufficient for the purpose, several ventilators should be provided in distant
parts of the room, as already suggested. This simple arrangement, then, provides for the more
even dissemination of heat through all parts of the room, and thus secures a more uniform temperature,
and, at the same time, provides a purer air for respiration, contributes greatly to the comfort
and health of the scholars, and fulfills several important conditions which are essential to
the most successful prosecution of their studies, and to the maintenance and improvement of
social and moral, as well as intellectual and physical health.

By inclosing the stove on three sides in a case of sheet iron, leaving a space of two or three
inches between the case and the stove for an air chamber, the air will become more perfectly
warmed before entering the room at the top of the case. The best mode, however, of warming
and ventilating large school-houses is by pure air heated in a furnace placed in the basement.
The whole house can in this way be warmed without any inconvenience to the school from maintaining
the fires, on account of either noise, dust, or smoke. But as this mode of warming can not
be advantageously adopted except in very large schools, it will not often be found desirable
out of cities and large villages.

LIBRARY AND APPARATUS.--I have already said that every school-house should have a room for
recitations, library, and apparatus. In country districts where but one teacher is employed
in a school, it will perhaps generally be found convenient to conduct the majority of the recitations
in the principal school-room. But even where this practice obtains, there is still urgent necessity
for a room for a library, apparatus, and other purposes.

Several of the states have carried into successful operation the noble system of District Libraries.
These, in the single state of New York, already contain nearly two millions of volumes. In
some of the new states the system of Township Libraries has been adopted, which, on some accounts,
is better adapted to a sparse population with limited means. These, in the State of Michigan,
already contain one hundred thousand volumes. The director of each school district draws from
the township library every three months the number of books his district is entitled to. These,
for the time being, constitute the district library, and each citizen in the township is thus
allowed the use of all the books in the township library.

Now, whichever of these systems is adopted, the school-house is the appropriate depository
of the library. There are many reasons for this. It is central. It is the property of the district.
During term-time it is visited daily by members from perhaps every family in the district.
There may, and should be, a time fixed, at least once a week, when the library will be open,
the librarian or his assistant being in attendance, at which time books may be returned and
drawn anew. For this purpose, and on all accounts, no place can be so appropriate and free
from objection as the school-house. The library may also be opened one or more evenings in
the week, and especially during the winter, when evenings are long, as a district reading-room.
Moreover, should a District Lyceum be established, the use of a well-selected library, which
will always be at hand, and of appropriate apparatus for the illustration of scientific lectures,
will contribute greatly to increase both the popularity and the usefulness of the institution.

With such an arrangement, the children of the district would most assuredly be much more benefited
by the instructions they would receive. The school would also possess many attractions for
adults of both sexes, and by the co-operation of the wise and the good, its refining, purifying,
and regenerating influences may be brought effectually to bear upon every family and every
individual within the boundaries of the district.

Such a room as I have described will also be found important for various other purposes, as
a commodious place for retirement in case of sudden indisposition, a place where a teacher
may see a patron or a friend in private, should it be at any time desirable, or a parent his
child. It would also be of great service in giving the teacher an opportunity to see scholars
in private, for various purposes, as well as in affording a convenient room for scholars to
retire to, with the permission of the teacher, for mutual instruction.

That able and judicious advocate of popular enlightenment, and eminently successful school
officer, the Honorable Henry Barnard, does not over-estimate the importance of district libraries.
In speaking of the benefits they confer upon a community, he says, "Wherever such libraries
have existed, especially in connection with the advantages of superior schools and an educated
ministry, they have called forth talent and virtue, which would otherwise have been buried
in poverty and ignorance, to elevate, bless, and purify society. The establishment of a library
in every school-house will bring the mighty instrument of good books to act more directly and
more broadly on the entire population of a state than it has ever yet done; for it will open
the fountains of knowledge, without money and without price, to the humble and the elevated,
the poor and the rich."

APPURTENANCES TO SCHOOL-HOUSES.--There are, perhaps, in the majority of school-houses, a pail
for water, a cup, a broom, and a chair for the teacher. Some one or more of these are frequently
wanting. I need hardly say, every school-house should be supplied with them all. In addition
to these, every school-house should be furnished with the following articles: 1. An evaporating
dish for the stove, which should be supplied with clean pure water. 2. A thermometer, by which
the temperature of the room may be regulated. 3. A clock, by which the time of beginning and
closing school, and conducting all its exercises, may be governed. 4. A shovel and tongs. 5.
An ash-pail and an ash-house. For want of these, much filth is frequently suffered to accumulate
in and about the school-house, and not unfrequently the house itself takes fire and burns down.
6. A wood-house, well supplied with seasoned wood. 7. A well, with provisions not only for
drinking, but for the cleanliness of pupils. 8. And last, though not least, in this connection,
two privies, in the rear of the school-house, separated by a high close fence, one for the
boys and the other for the girls. For want of these indispensable appendages of civilization,
the delicacy of children is frequently offended, and their morals corrupted. Nay, more, the
unnatural detention of the fæces, when nature calls for an evacuation, is frequently the foundation
for chronic diseases, and the principal cause of permanent ill health, resulting not unfrequently
in premature death. The accommodations in this respect provided by a district in a country
village of the Northwest, whose schools have become celebrated, are none too ample. Two octagonal
privies are provided--one for each sex--each of which has seven apartments. These are cleansed
every two weeks, regularly, and oftener, if necessary.

Mr. Barnard, in treating upon the external arrangements of school-houses, has the following
sensible remarks: "The building should not only be located on a dry, healthy, and pleasant
site, but be surrounded by a yard, of never less than half an acre, protected by a neat and
substantial inclosure. This yard should be large enough in front for all to occupy in common
for recreation and sport, and planted with oaks, elms, maples, and other shady trees, tastefully
arranged in groups and around the sides. In the rear of the building, it should be divided
by a high and close fence, and one portion, appropriately fitted up, should be assigned exclusively
for the use of boys, and the other for girls. Over this entire arrangement the most perfect
neatness, seclusion, order, and propriety should be enforced, and every thing calculated to
defile the mind, or wound the delicacy or the modesty of the most sensitive, should receive
attention in private, and be made a matter of parental advice and co-operation.

"In cities and populous districts, particular attention should be paid to the play-ground,
as connected with the physical education of children. In the best-conducted schools, the play-ground
is now regarded as the uncovered school-room, where the real dispositions and habits of the
pupils are more palpably developed, and can be more wisely trained, than under the restraint
of an ordinary school-room. These grounds are provided with circular swings, and are large
enough for various athletic games. To protect the children in their sports in inclement weather,
in some places, the school-house is built on piers; in others, the basement story is properly
fitted up, and thrown open as a play-ground."

A good and substantial room, well fitted up, and properly warmed in cold weather, in which
children may conduct their sports, under the supervision of a teacher or monitor, is of the
utmost importance; and especially is this true of all schools for small children. Such a room
is, indeed, for these, hardly less important than the school-room. Among other things, it should
be supplied with dumb-bells,[70] see-saws, weights and measures of various kinds, etc., etc.
These are important for both boys and girls; but, as they are uncommon, it may be well to suggest
the proper mode of using them, and the advantages they confer.

  [70] Dumb-bells are usually made of cast iron, and sometimes of
  bell-metal, of the shape indicated by the figure, and should weigh from
  two to ten pounds each, according to the strength of the person using
  them. 

Dumb-bells may be used, in connection with the sports enumerated in the third chapter, for
developing and strengthening the chest and improving the health. I would refer any who question
the fitness of such exercises to what has been said on the subject at the 77th and following
pages, and especially to the testimony of Dr. Caldwell there introduced.

See-saws, in addition to the benefits that result from the exercise, are attractive, and may
be rendered highly instructive. For this purpose, the plank or board used should be well hung
and properly balanced. The distance from the fulcrum or point of support should be accurately
graduated, and marked in feet and inches. Then, knowing the weight of one scholar, the weights
of all the others may be ascertained by their relative distances from the fulcrum when they
exactly balance. These interesting experiments may be tried by any child as soon as he understands
the ground rules of arithmetic, and the simple fact that, for two children to balance, the
product of the weight of one multiplied into his distance from the fulcrum will exactly equal
the product of the weight of the other into his distance from the fulcrum. Such simple experiments,
when thus mingled with sports, and made interesting to young children, serve the double purpose
of attaching them to the school, and of fixing in their minds the habit of observation and
experiment, and of understanding the why and wherefore, which will be of incalculable service
to them all the way through life.

Weights and measures serve the same general purpose, and may be rendered well-nigh as useful
as slates and black-boards. Thousands of children recite every year the table, "four gills
make a pint, two pints make a quart, four quarts make a gallon," etc., month in and month out,
without any distinct idea of what constitutes a gill or a quart, or even knowing which of the
two is the greater. But let these measures be once introduced into the experimental play-room,
and let the child, under the supervision of the teacher or monitor, actually see that four
gills make a pint, etc., and he will learn the table with ten-fold greater pleasure than he
otherwise would, and in one tenth the time.

The same general remark will apply to the other tables of weight and measure, to experimental
philosophy, and to nearly every branch of study pursued in the common schools of our country.
I have but one other general remark to make on this subject, and that is in relation to the

INFLUENCE OF SCHOOL-HOUSES.--Cicero observes that the face of a man will be tinged by the sun,
for whatever purpose he walks abroad; so, by daily associations, the minds of all persons are
influenced, and their characters permanently affected, by scenes with which they are familiar;
and especially is this true during the impressive periods of childhood and youth. Many persons
seem to think that schoolmasters and school-mistresses do all the teaching in our schools.
But it is not so. Fellow-students, neighbors, and citizens teach by precept and by example;
and especially do school-houses teach. And oh! what lessons of degradation, pollution, and
ruin they sometimes impart! as he can not fail to be convinced who remembers the testimony
already introduced in relation to their condition.

I have seen the fond parent accompany his lovely child of four summers to the school the first
day of its attendance. The child had seen pictures of school-houses in books. Pictures, if
not always pretty, usually please children. It was so in this case. The child, anxious to go
to school, talked of the school-house on the way. There arrived, the parent passed his innocent
little one into the care of the teacher, with a few remarks, and was about to retire, when
the child, clinging to him, said, pathetically and energetically, "Pa! pa!! I don't want to
stay in this ugly old house; I am afraid it will fall down on me: I want to go home to our
own pretty parlor." But the parent, breaking away from his child, leaves it in tears, with
a sad heart. How cruel to do such violence to the tender feelings of innocent children! And
how baneful the influence! The school, instead of being a comfortable, pleasant, and delightful
place, as it should be, is to the child positively offensive, and the school-house a dreary
prison. "Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined." The child learns to hate school, to
hate instruction, and all that is good. He soon becomes the practiced truant. In a few years
he arrives at manhood; but, instead of being a blessing to his family and a useful member of
society, he too frequently drags out a wretched life, in ignorance and penury, dividing it
between the poor-house and jail, and terminating it, peradventure, upon the gallows.

It needs the pen of a ready writer duly to portray the influence of neglected school-houses.
Parents seem to have forgotten that, while men sleep, the enemy comes and sows tares; that
if good school-houses do not elevate, neglected ones will pollute their children. I have already
alluded, in the language of others, to the representations of vulgarity and obscenity that
meet the eye in every direction. But I am constrained to add, that, during the intermissions,
and before school, "certain lewd fellows of the baser sort" sometimes lecture in the hearing
of the school generally, boys and girls, large and small, illustrating their subject by these
vulgar delineations.

But why are these things so? And how may they be remedied? Different persons will answer these
questions variously. But when we bear in mind that, in architectural appearance, school-houses
have very generally more resembled barns, sheds for cattle, or mechanic shops, than Temples
of Science; that windows are broken; that benches are mutilated; that desks are cut up; that
wood is unprovided; that out-buildings are neglected; that obscene images and vulgar delineations
meet the eye within and without; that, in fine, their very appearance is so contemptible, that
scholars feel themselves degraded in being obliged to occupy them; when we bear in mind all
these things, and then consider that the impressive minds of children are necessarily and permanently
affected by scenes with which they become familiar, we can not wonder that they yield themselves
to such influences, and consent to increase their degradation by multiplying the abominations
with which they are surrounded. And especially shall we cease to wonder at the existence of
these things, when we consider that scholars are very often unfurnished with suitable employment;
that the younger scholars are frequently urged on by the example and influence of the older
ones; and that teachers are sometimes employed who are so far lost to shame as to countenance
these disgusting and corrupting practices by engaging in them themselves!

A knowledge of the cause suggests the remedy. Let, then, the school-house be commodious and
cleanly; inviting in its appearance, and elevating in its influence. Let every member of the
school, at all times, be furnished with entertaining and profitable employment. Let the corrupting
influence of bad example be at once and forever removed. And, finally, let the services of
a well-qualified teacher, of good morals, correct example, and who is scrupulously watchful,
be invariably secured.

But if the mean appearance of our school-houses is one reason why they are so defaced, it may
be asked, why do not our churches, which are frequently among the most elegant specimens of
architecture, escape the pollution? The reason is evident. The foul habit is contracted in
the unseemly school-house, and it becomes so established that it is very difficult to suspend
its exercise even in the Temple of God. Were our school-houses, in point of neatness and architecture,
equal to our churches, the evil in question would soon become less prevalent, and, with judicious
supervision, we might safely predict its early extinction.

I would not suggest that too much pains are taken to make our churches pleasant and comfortable,
but I do protest that there is a great and unwise disproportion in the appearance of our churches
and school-houses. It is frequently the case in villages and country neighborhoods, that the
expense of the former is from fifty to eighty times the value of the latter. The appearance
of our school-houses is an important consideration. If we would cultivate the beastly propensities
of our youth, we have but to provide them places of instruction resembling the hovels which
our cattle occupy, and the work is well begun. On the contrary, if we would take into the account
the whole duration of our being, and the cultivation and right development of the nobler faculties
of our nature, while the animal propensities are allowed to remain in a quiescent state, and
adapt means to ends, our school-houses should be pleasant and tasteful. Every thing offensive
should be separated from them, and no pains should be spared to give them an inviting aspect
and an elevating influence.

It is easier to make children good than to reform wicked men. It is cheaper to construct commodious
school-houses, with pleasant yards and suitable appurtenances, than to erect numerous jails
and extensive prisons. George B. Emerson, in a lecture on moral education, speaks to the point.
"In regard to the lower animal propensities," says he, "the only safe principle is, that nothing
should be allowed which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to excite them. In many places
there prevails an alarming and criminal indifference upon this point. It is one toward which
the attention of the teacher should be carefully directed. No sound should be suffered from
the lips; no word, or figure, or mark should be allowed to reach the eyes, to deface the wall
of the house or out-house, which could give offense to the most sensitive delicacy. This is
the teacher's business. He must not be indifferent to it. He has no right to neglect it. He
can not transfer it to another. He, and he only, is responsible.[71] It is impossible to be
over-scrupulous in this matter. And the committee should see that the teacher does his duty;
otherwise all his lessons in duty are of no avail, and the school, instead of being a source
of purity, delicacy, and refinement, becomes a fountain of corruption, throwing out poisonous
waters, and rendering the moral influence more pestiferous than that fabled fountain of old,
over which no creature of heaven could fly and escape death."

  [71] I would by no means free parents from responsibility in this
  matter. They, if any class, may be said to be "alone responsible;" but,
  in fact, all who are intrusted with the care of children share in the
  responsibility. Secret vice, in the opinion of those who have had
  occasion to remark the extent to which it is practiced, from colleges
  and the higher seminaries of learning down to the common school, and
  even in the nursery before the child is sent to school, prevails to an
  alarming extent. It is often the principal, and, in many instances, the
  sole cause of a host of evils that are commonly attributed to hard
  study, among which are impaired nutrition, and general lassitude and
  weakness, especially of the loins and back; loss of memory, dullness of
  apprehension, and both indisposition and incapacity for study;
  dizziness, affections of the eyes, headaches, etc., etc. Secret vice in
  childhood and youth is also a fruitful source of social vice later in
  life, and of excesses even within the pale of wedlock, ruinous alike to
  the parties themselves and to their offspring. Licentiousness in some of
  its forms, as we have frequently had occasion to see, from the highest
  testimony introduced into the text in various passages, in addition to
  the evils here referred to, sometimes leads to the most driveling
  idiocy, and to insanity in its worst forms. All, then, who have the
  charge of children, and especially parents and teachers, should exercise
  a rational familiarity with them on this delicate but important subject.
  They should give them timely counsel in relation to the temptations to
  which they may be exposed, apprise them of the evils that follow in the
  train of disobedience, and endeavor, by kindly advice and friendly
  admonition, to infix in their minds a delicate sense of honor, an
  abhorrence for this whole class of vice, and a determination never to
  entertain a thought of indulging the appetite for sex except within the
  pale of wedlock, and in accordance with God's own appointment.

WELL-QUALIFIED TEACHERS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED.

    All the provisions heretofore described would be of none effect if
    we took no pains to procure for the public school thus constituted
    an able master, and worthy of the high vocation of instructing the
    people. It can not be too often repeated, that it is the master that
    makes the school.--GUIZOT.

    Society can never feel the power of education until it calls into
    exercise a class of effective educators.--LALOR.

    One of the surest signs of the regeneration of society will be the
    elevation of the art of teaching to the highest rank in the
    community.--CHANNING.

We come next to the consideration of school teachers; for, in order to have good schools, we
want not merely good school-houses. These, as already seen, are of the utmost importance; but,
to insure success, we must have good teachers in those houses. And here, were I addressing
myself exclusively to the members of this profession, it would be appropriate to dwell in detail
upon the requisite qualifications of teachers. But this would be foreign from my present design.[72]

  [72] Among the many excellent works already before the public, I would
  name the following, which the practical teacher may profitably consult:
  THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOLMASTER, by Dr. Potter and G. B. Emerson; THEORY
  AND PRACTICE OF TEACHING, by D. P. Page; THE SCHOOL TEACHER'S MANUAL,
  by Henry Dunn; THE TEACHER, by Jacob Abbott; THE TEACHER'S MANUAL, by
  Thomas H. Palmer; THE TEACHER TAUGHT, by Emerson Davis; SLATE AND
  BLACK-BOARD EXERCISES, by Wm. A. Alcott; LECTURES ON EDUCATION, by
  Horace Mann; CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, by Lyman Cobb; CONFESSIONS OF A
  SCHOOLMASTER, by Wm. A. Alcott; THE TEACHER'S INSTITUTE, by Wm. B.
  Fowle; THE TRUE RELATION OF THE SEXES, by John Ware. These are also
  useful to parents. A more extended list, with tables of contents, may be
  found in Barnard's School Architecture, p. 279 to 288.

It has not been my intention in any thing I have yet said, nor will it be in any thing I may
hereafter urge, to overlook the importance of domestic education. Napoleon once said to an
accomplished French lady that the old systems of education were good for nothing, and inquired
what was wanting for the proper training of young persons in France. With keen discernment
and great truth, she replied, in one word--Mothers. This reply forcibly impressed the emperor,
and he exclaimed, "Behold an entire system of education! You must make mothers that know how
to train their children." I may add, we want mothers not only, but fathers too, qualified for
the great work of training their offspring aright; for parents are readily admitted to be the
natural educators of their children. But the literary training of children has always been
accomplished chiefly by delegation; and not only the literary, but, to a great extent, the
moral and religious.

This course has been adopted on account of the situation of families; many parents being unable
to teach their children themselves, and others lacking the necessary leisure to carry forward
a systematic and thorough course of instruction. This course is dictated by policy; for the
children of a whole neighborhood may be better taught, and at less expense, in good schools,
than in their respective families. This course has also been adopted as a matter of necessity;
for the greatness of the work of education requires, in order to carry it forward successfully,
that it should be studied as a profession. The teacher then engages jointly with the parent
in the work of education, and with him shares its toils, its responsibilities, and its delights.

From the greatness of the teacher's work, as we have already considered it--training, as he
should, his youthful charge for respectability, usefulness, and happiness in this life, and
for everlasting felicity in that which is to come--we may infer what should be his qualifications.
And we remark, in the general, that the business of

School teaching should rank among the learned professions. The teacher should well understand
the nature of the subjects of education, as physical, intellectual, and moral beings. The education
of children can not safely be intrusted to persons who are not practically acquainted with
human physiology, and with mental science as based thereon. The most serious physical evils
frequently result from allowing incompetent persons to exercise the functions of this high
and responsible vocation.

In addition to a thorough knowledge of all the branches in which a teacher is expected to give
instruction, and an acquaintance with those collateral branches that have a bearing upon them,
the instructor of youth should possess the rare attainment of aptness to teach. It will be
of little avail if the teacher has become familiar with all wisdom, unless he can readily communicate
instruction to others. Paul, in speaking of the qualifications of bishops, says, among other
things, they should be "apt to teach." This attainment is no less important for schoolmasters
than for bishops. It is especially important that the teacher should be well acquainted with
intellectual philosophy and moral science. This is necessary, in order to enable him to judge
correctly of character, and to teach, and govern, and train his charge aright. But these attainments
can never be made until teaching is elevated to the rank of a profession.

The lawyer is required to devote a series of years to a regular course of classical study and
professional reading before he can find employment in a case in which a few dollars only are
pending. With this we find no fault. But it should not be forgotten that the teacher's calling
is as much more important than the ordinary exercise of the legal profession, as the imperishable
riches of mind are more valuable than the corruptible treasures of earth.

We seek out from among us men of sound discretion and good report to enact laws for the government
of the state and nation. And with this, too, we find no fault. It is right and proper that
we should do so. But it should be borne in mind that it is the teacher's high prerogative not
only so to instruct and train the rising generation that they shall rightly understand law,
but to infix in their minds the principles of justice and equity, the attainment of which is
the high aim of legislation. While our legislators enact laws for the government of the people,
the well-qualified and faithful schoolmaster prepares those under his charge to govern themselves.
Without the teacher's conservative influence, under the best legislation, the great mass of
the people will be lawless; while the tendency of his labors is to qualify the rising generation,
who constitute our future freemen and our country's hope, to render an enlightened, a cheerful,
and a ready obedience to the high claims of civil law. The well-qualified, faithful teacher,
then, becomes the right arm of the legislator.

The physician is required to become thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy and physiology of
the human body; in a word, to become acquainted with "the house I live in;" to understand the
diseases to which we are subject, and their proper treatment, before he is allowed to extract
a tooth, to open a vein, or administer the simplest medicine. Nor with this do we find fault,
for we justly prize the body. It is the habitation of the immortal mind. When in health, it
is the mind's servant, and ready to do its biddings; but darken its windows by disease, and
it becomes the mind's prison-house. But while the physician, whom we honor and love, is required
to make these attainments before he is permitted even to repair "the house I live in," should
not he who teaches the MASTER of the house be entitled to a respectable rank in society?

It is common, in the various branches of the Church universal, for men who feel themselves
called of God to preach the Gospel to obtain a collegiate education, and then devote several
years to professional study, before exercising the functions of the sacred office; and this
has been required by popular opinion. And heretofore, I may add, the efforts of the minister
have been directed chiefly to the reformation of adults whose early training has been imperfectly
attended to, and to the building up of a religious character where no correct early foundation
has been laid, when the time and energies of a people upon whom labor is bestowed are devoted
chiefly to absorbing secular pursuits. The competent and faithful teacher, on the contrary,
enters upon the discharge of his duties under circumstances widely different, and with infinitely
better prospects of success. Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. These are they upon whom the teacher is called
to bestow labor. He remembers that Solomon the wise has said, Train up a child in the way he
should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it; and he confidently expects that,
with proper parental co-operation, if he faithfully discharges his duty, and directs his efforts
in accordance with the will of the Great Teacher, his youthful charge, when arrived at the
years of accountability, and in all future life, will be like "the child Samuel, who grew on,
and was in favor both with the Lord and also with men." No wonder, then, that Channing should
say, "One of the surest signs of the regeneration of society will be the elevation of teaching
to the highest rank in the community."

The clerical profession can never equal that of the teacher in moral sublimity and prospective
usefulness until religious teachers come to direct their attention chiefly to the correct early
education of the young in the Sabbath-schools, but more especially in the common schools of
our country. Then, and not till then, will it be entitled to the pre-eminence.

Should any teacher, in view of the immense responsibilities of his calling, be disposed to
inquire, as all well may, Who is sufficient for these things? we would say to him, in the language
of Wirt, "Let your motto be Perseverando vinces--by perseverance thou wilt overcome. Practice
upon it, and you will be convinced of its value by the distinguished pre-eminence to which
it will lead you."

Parents and citizens generally should be impressed with the truth of the maxim, "As is the
teacher, so will be the school." They should desire for their own children, and for all others,
teachers whose intellectual, social, and moral habits are, in all respects, what they are willing
their children should form. They should, at least, be well apprised of this fact: If the teacher
is not, in these respects, what they would have their children become, their children will
be likely to become what the teacher is.

There is a story of a German schoolmaster, which shows the low notions that may be entertained
of education. Stouber, the predecessor of Oberlin, the pastor of Waldbach, on his arrival at
the place, desired to be shown to the principal school-house. He was conducted into a miserable
cottage, where a number of children were crowded together, without any occupation. He inquired
for the master. "There he is," said one, as soon as silence could be obtained, pointing to
a withered old man, who lay on a little bed in one corner. "Are you the master, my friend?"
asked Stouber. "Yes, sir." "And what do you teach the children?" "Nothing, sir." "Nothing!
how is that?" "Because," replied the old man, "I know nothing myself." "Why, then, were you
appointed the schoolmaster?" "Why, sir, I had been taking care of the Waldbach pigs a number
of years, and when I got too old and infirm for that employment, they sent me here to take
care of the children."

This anecdote may evince a degree of stupidity not to be met with in this country. We are,
however, very far from being as careful in the selection of teachers as we ought to be. Unworthy
teachers frequently find employment. I refer not to teachers whose literary qualifications
are insufficient, although, as we have already seen, there are quite too many such. I refer
now more particularly to those who are disqualified for the office because of moral obliquity.

Teachers are sometimes employed who are habitual Sabbath breakers; who are accustomed to the
use of vulgar and profane language; who frequent the gambling table; who habitually use tobacco,
in several of its forms, and that in the school-house! nay, more, who even teach the despicable
habit to their children during school hours! Several emperors have prohibited the use of this
filthy weed in their respective kingdoms, under the severest penalties. The pope has made a
bull to excommunicate all those who use tobacco in the churches. One of the most numerous of
the Protestant sects once prohibited the use of tobacco in their society; but so strong is
this filthy habit, especially when formed in early life, that this society has backslidden
and given up this excellent rule.

Since writing the above, I have noticed an article headed "Tobacco-using Ministers," which
has appeared in several highly-reputable and widely-circulating periodicals, from which it
appears that a large annual conference of divines of the same order, among other resolutions,
have adopted one recommending "that the ministers refrain from the use of tobacco in all its
forms, especially in the house of worship."

In commenting upon this action, a religious paper observes, that "by 'tobacco in all its forms'
we suppose is meant chewing, smoking, and snuffing. But can it be possible that a minister,
whose duty it is to recommend purity, and whose example should be cleanliness, can need conference
resolutions to dissuade him from a practice so filthy and disgusting? And do they even carry
this inconsistency into the 'house of worship?' So it seems!" But such is the severity of the
strictures in the article referred to, that, although just, I forbear inserting them.

It has been suggested that, while Robinson Crusoe was alone on his island, he may have had
a right to smoke, snuff, or chew; but that, when his man Friday came, "a decent regard for
the opinions of mankind"--as the Declaration of Independence has it--should have debarred him
at once from further indulgence.

One who has enjoyed large opportunities of observing, and who is scrupulous to a proverb, has
remarked, that "the ministerial profession is probably the most offending in this particular.
The Scriptures have much to say about keeping the body pure. Had tobacco been known to the
Hebrews, who can doubt that it would have been among the articles prohibited by the Levitical
law? What sort of a 'temple of the Holy Ghost' is he, every atom and molecule of whose physical
system is saturated and stenched with the vile fetor of tobacco; whose every vesicle is distended
by its foul gases; whose brain and marrow are begrimed and blackened with its sooty vapors
and effluxions; all whose pores jet forth its malignant stream like so many hydrants; whose
prayers are breathed out, not with a sweet, but with a foul-smelling savor; who baptizes infants
with a hand which itself needs literal baptism and purification as by fire; and who carries
to the bed-side of the dying an odor which, if the 'immaterial essence' could be infected by
any earthly virus, would subject the departed soul to quarantine before it could enter the
gates of heaven?"[73]

  [73] A female teacher in the Bay State, in 1847, addressed the following
  inquiry through the columns of the Massachusetts Common School Journal:

  "I have been laboring for the last year in a large school, and have
  endeavored, according to the best of my ability, to inculcate habits of
  neatness among the pupils, especially to break them of the filthy habit
  of spitting upon the floor. I have often told them gentlemen never do
  it. But at a recent visit of the committee, an individual, who has been
  elected by the town to superintend the educational interests of the
  rising generation, spit the dirty juice of his tobacco quid upon the
  floor of my school-room with apparent self-complacency.

  "Shall I say to the children that this person is not a gentleman,
  and thus destroy his influence? or shall I pass it over in silence, and
  thus leave them to draw the natural inference that all I have said on
  the subject is only a woman's whim?"

  Mr. Mann, the editor, gave a full reply through the Journal, from which
  I have here quoted part of a paragraph. He closes by offering a prize of
  the "eternal gratitude of all decent men" to the discoverer of a remedy
  or antidote for the evil.

"Touch not, taste not, handle not," is the only safe rule in relation to all vicious practices;
and especially is it true of this habit, which we can not call beastly, for there is not a
natural beast in creation that indulges in it. I therefore congratulate my countrymen in view
of the prospect before us of ultimately being freed from this disgusting and filthy habit,
for the Board of Education in some of our cities have already wisely adopted the rule of employing
no teachers who use tobacco in any form. Let this rule become universal among us, and the next
generation will be comparatively free from the use of that repulsive weed, which only one of
all created beings takes to naturally. Wherever else the filthy practice may be allowed, it
ought never to be permitted in a house consecrated to the sacred work of educating the rising
generation. And just look at the immense expenditure in this country for the support of this
pernicious habit. It is said, on good authority, that for smoking merely we pay annually a
tax of ten millions of dollars, which is a much greater sum than is paid to the teachers of
all the public schools in the United States.

But to return: teachers are sometimes employed who are addicted to inebriety; who are notorious
libertines, and unblushingly boast of the number of their victims. But I will not extend this
dark catalogue. Comment is unnecessary. My fellow-countrymen, who have carefully perused and
properly weighed the preceding considerations, I doubt not, will concur with me in the opinion
that there is no station in life--no, not excepting even the clerical office, that, in order
to be well filled, so much demands purity of heart, simplicity of life, Christian courtesy,
and every thing that will ennoble man, and beautify and give dignity to the human character,
as that of the primary school-teacher. He influences his pupils in the formation of habits
and character, by precept, it is true, but chiefly by example. His example, then, should be
such, that, if strictly followed by his pupils, it will lead them aright in all things, astray
in nothing. It should be his chief concern to allure to brighter worlds on high, and himself
lead the way. Then, and not till then, will he be prepared to magnify and fill his office.

But, it may be said, we have not a sufficiency of well-qualified teachers, according to this
standard, to take the charge of all, or of any considerable part of our schools. This is very
readily admitted. Some such, however, there are. These should be employed. Their influence
will be felt by others. The present generation of teachers may be much improved by means of
teachers' associations and teachers' institutes. By the establishment of normal schools, or
teachers' seminaries, a higher grade of teachers may be trained up and qualified to take the
charge of the next generation of scholars. These institutions have been established in several
of the European states, in New England and New York, and more recently in Michigan, by the
several State Legislatures, and to some extent in other states. "Those seminaries for training
masters," says Lord Brougham, "are an invaluable gift to mankind, and lead to the indefinite
improvement of education." In remarking upon their advantages, the same high authority says,
"These training seminaries would not only teach the masters the branches of learning and science
they are now deficient in, but would teach them what they know far less--the didactic art--the
mode of imparting the knowledge which they have or may acquire; the best mode of training and
dealing with children in all that regards both temper, capacity, and habits, and the means
of stirring them to exertion, and controlling their aberrations."

Normal schools are essential to the complete success of any system of popular education. The
necessity for their establishment can not fail to be apparent to any one at all competent to
judge, when he considers the early age at which young persons of both sexes generally enter
upon the business of school-teaching--or, perhaps I may more appropriately say, of "keeping"
school; for the majority of them can hardly be regarded as competent to teach.

For the purpose of being more specific, and of impressing, if possible, upon the mind of the
reader, the necessity of professional instruction, the author trusts he will be pardoned for
introducing a few paragraphs from a report made nine years ago as county superintendent of
common schools in the State of New York and which was printed at that time in the Assembly
documents of that state. The author, at the time referred to, exercised a general supervision
over more than twenty thousand children, aided in the examination of the teachers of twenty
large townships, and visited and inspected their schools. Nine years' additional experience--four
of which have been devoted to the supervision of the schools of a large state, and a considerable
portion of the remaining time to the visitation of schools in different states--has convinced
him that the condition of common schools, and the qualifications of teachers in those states
of the Union where increased attention has not been bestowed upon the subject within a few
years past, are not in advance of what they were at that time in the county referred to. The
paragraphs introduced are included within brackets.

[LITERARY QUALIFICATIONS.--Some of the teachers possess a very limited knowledge of the branches
usually taught in our common schools. This is true even of a portion of those who have bestowed
considerable attention upon some of the higher branches of study. There is in our common schools,
and indeed in our higher schools, an undue anxiety to advance rapidly. A score of persons may
be heard speaking of the number of their recitations, of their rapid progress, and perhaps
of skipping difficulties, while hardly one will speak of progressing understandingly, and comprehending
every principle as he proceeds. When students speak of their progress in study, their first
qualifying word should be thorough, after which, if they please, they may add rapid.

The following circumstances, that have occurred in classes of both ladies and gentlemen who
have presented themselves for examination as candidates for teaching, illustrate the nature
and extent of the evil. I have more than once received, in answer to the question "What is
language?" the following reply: "Language is an unlimited sense." I have met with some experienced
teachers, holding two or three town certificates, who did not know one half of the marks and
pauses used in writing. They could, indeed, generally recite the answers in the spelling-book
with some degree of accuracy; but when the marks have been pointed out, and their names and
use have been asked, teachers in service have sometimes mistaken the note of interrogation
for a parenthesis, and made other as gross errors. In answer to the question "What is arithmetic?"
I have several times received the following reply: "It is the art of science," etc. Sometimes
this constitutes the entire reply. In one instance four fifths of the class united in this
answer. The terms sum, remainder, product, and quotient are frequently applied indiscriminately
in the four ground rules of arithmetic. There are, hence, three chances for them to be used
erroneously where there is one chance for them to be correctly applied. The following expressions
are common: Add up and set down the remainder; subtract and set down the quotient; multiply
and write down the sum; divide and write down the product, etc.: never so much as thinking
that sum belongs to addition; remainder, to subtraction; product, to multiplication; and quotient,
to division. In attending the examination of such teachers, any person of discernment will
soon become satisfied that with them "language is an unlimited sense;" that "arithmetic is
the art of science;" and that grammar, too, is "the art of science;" for the same answer has
been given to the question, "What is grammar?" I introduce these things, not for the purpose
of ridiculing any portion of our teachers, but to exemplify the extent of the evil under consideration.

The majority of teachers manifest a tolerable familiarity with the branches usually taught
in our common schools. They have not, however, generally studied more than one author on the
same subject.

A portion of our teachers, it gives me pleasure to add, are not only superior scholars in the
common English branches, but they have made respectable attainments in philosophy, astronomy,
chemistry, algebra, Latin, etc. All of these branches are successfully taught in a few of our
schools.

SCHOOL GOVERNMENT.--There is, perhaps, as wide a difference in the administration of government
in our common schools as in any other particular connected with them. Good government requires
the healthful exercise of a rare combination of good qualities. But this can not reasonably
be expected in inexperienced youth, who, instead of being guided by enlightened moral sentiment,
have not only never subjected themselves to government, but are totally unacquainted with the
principles upon which it should be administered. About one third of our schools are tolerably
well governed. A portion of them are under a wise and parental supervision, the government
being uniformly mild, and at the same time efficient. But indecision, rashness, and inefficiency
are far more common. Sometimes teachers resolve to have no whispering, leaving seats, asking
questions, etc., among any of the scholars, and severely punish every detected offender. Soon
a portion of the patrons justly manifest dissatisfaction. Then all attempts to govern the school
are unwisely given up. Many teachers thus rashly fly from one extreme of government to the
other, without stopping to test the "golden mean," or even appearing to bestow a single thought
upon the subject.

Again: the feelings of the teacher have been outraged by having frequently witnessed severity,
and even cruelty, in government; and, in studiously avoiding them, he has inadvertently adopted
a lax government, if government it may be called. The latter may be the more amiable extreme,
but it is hardly the less fatal. I have heard scholars say in the presence of such a teacher,
"We have a good teacher, who gives us all the good advice we need, and then lets us do as we
please;" and then I have witnessed whispering, talking, chewing gum and throwing it about the
house, passing from seat to seat, playing with tops and whirls, tossing wads of wet paper about
the house and to the ceiling, cutting images upon the desks, imitating the practice of botanic
physicians, exhibiting and passing from one to another roots and herbs, and discoursing upon
their properties, chasing mice about the house, and in some instances slaying them, and practicing
sundry other antics too numerous to be mentioned. Good advice was freely given, but it was
disregarded with impunity.

Government in school, as elsewhere, should be mild but efficient. The teacher should speak
kindly, but with authority. Every request should meet with a ready compliance. The scholars
will not only fear to disobey such a teacher, but will, at the same time, respect, and even
love him. This is not only good theory, but is susceptible of being reduced to practice. It
is, indeed, exemplified in many of our schools, as a visit to them will clearly manifest. I
know of no one thing in school government more mischievous in its tendency than the habit of
speaking several times without being obeyed.

MODE OF INSTRUCTION.--In some schools the instruction is thorough and systematic. In them the
scholars generally learn principles, and understand, and are able to explain, all that they
pass over. But this is the case in comparatively few schools. Scholars generally are poorly
instructed, and understand very imperfectly what they profess to have learned. I will give
a few illustrations:

First. Scholars are frequently introduced to the twenty-six letters of the alphabet four times
a day for several weeks in succession, without making a single acquaintance. They occasionally
become so familiar with their names and order as to repeat them down and back, as well without
the book as with it, before learning a single letter.

This method of instruction is as unphilosophical as it is unsuccessful. Were I to be introduced
to twenty-six strangers, and were my introducer to pronounce their names in rapid succession
down and back, giving me merely an opportunity of pronouncing them after him, I should hardly
expect to form a single acquaintance with twenty-six introductions. But were he to introduce
me to one, and give me an opportunity of shaking hands with him, of conversing with him, of
observing his features, etc.; and were he then to introduce me to another, in like manner,
with the privilege of shaking hands again with the first, before my introduction to the third;
and were he thus to introduce me to them all successively, I might form twenty-six acquaintances
with one introduction.

The application is readily made. Introduce the abecedarian to but one letter at first. Describe
it to him familiarly. Fix its contour distinctly in his mind. Compare it with things with which
he is acquainted, if it will admit of such comparison. It might be well to make the letter
upon a slate or black-board. When he shall have become acquainted with one letter so as to
know it any where, introduce him to another. After he becomes acquainted with the second, let
him again point out the first. As he learns new letters, he will thus retain a knowledge of
those he has previously learned. It is immaterial where we commence, provided two conditions
are fulfilled. It would be well to have the first letters as simple in their construction,
and as easily described, as possible. It would be well, also, to have them so selected as to
combine and form simple words, with which the child is familiar. He will thus become encouraged
in his first efforts.

Suppose we commence with O, and tell the child that it is round; that it is shaped like the
button on his coat, or like a penny, which might be shown to him. After the child has become
somewhat familiar with its shape and name, suppose we inquire what there was on the breakfast
table shaped like O. It may be necessary to name a few articles, as knives, forks, spoons,
plates. Before there is time to proceed further, the child, in nine cases out of ten, will
say, "The plates look like O." Suppose we next take X, which may be represented by crossing
the fore-fingers, or two little sticks. We can now teach the child that these two letters,
combined, spell ox. We might then tell him a familiar story about oxen; that we put a yoke
on them; that they draw the cart, etc.; and that cart-wheels are great O's. Suppose we take
B next. We might tell the child that it is a straight line with two bows on the right side
of it, and that it is shaped some like the ox-yoke. We might then instruct him that these three
letters, B, O, and X, combined, spell box; that its top and sides are rectangles, and that
its ends are squares, if they are so. The child has now learned three letters, two words, and
a score of ideas. He, moreover, likes to go to school. Any other method in which children would
be equally interested might be pursued instead of this, which is only introduced as a specimen
of the manner in which the alphabet has been successfully taught.[74] Better methods may be
devised.

  [74] Since these suggestions were first given to the public, several
  excellent books for children have been published, constructed on a
  similar plan to that here recommended. It will generally be found
  advantageous to teach the vowels first, and then to teach such
  consonants as combine with the long sound of the vowel; as, for
  example, first o; then g, h, l, n, and s, when the child can read go,
  ho, lo, no, and so. After this, e may be learned, and then b, m, and s,
  when the child can read be, bee, me, and see. Then these may be combined
  as see me; lo, see me; see me ho; lo, see me ho, etc. The idea is, that
  every letter and combination of letters be used as fast they are
  learned.

Second. The Roman notation table is sometimes taught after the same manner. After spelling,
I have heard the teacher say to the class, One I.? to which the scholar at the head would reply,
one; and the exercise would continue through the class, as follows: two I.'s? two; three I.'s?
three; IV.? four; and so on, to two X.'s? twenty; three X.'s? twenty-one. No, says the teacher,
thirty. Thus corrected, the class went through the entire table, without making another mistake.
The thought occurred to me that they did not know their lesson, though they had recited it,
making but one mistake. With the permission of the teacher, I inquired of the class, "What
does IV. stand for?" None of them could tell. I then inquired, "What do VII. stand for?" They
all shook their heads. I next inquired, "What does IX. stand for?" and the teacher remarked,
"They have just got it learnt the other way; they ha'n't learnt it that way yet." They had
all learned to count; they hence recited correctly to twenty; and when told that three X.'s
stand for thirty instead of twenty-one, they passed on readily to forty, fifty, sixty, etc.,
without making another mistake. And this, too, is but a specimen of the evil.

In teaching this table, the child should be instructed, in the beginning, that there are but
seven letters used, by which all numbers may be represented; that when standing alone, I. represents
one; V., five; X., ten; L., fifty; C, one hundred; D., five hundred; and M., one thousand.
The child should next be taught that, as often as a letter is repeated, so many times its value
is repeated; thus, X. represents ten; two X.'s, twenty; three X.'s, thirty, etc.; that when
a letter representing a less number is placed after one representing a greater, its value is
to be added; thus, VII. represent seven; LX., sixty, etc.; that when a letter representing
a less number is placed before one representing a greater, its value is to be subtracted; thus,
IV. represents four; IX., nine; XL., forty, etc. When the child understands what is here presented,
he has the key to the whole matter. He is acquainted with the principle upon which the tables
are constructed, and a little practice will enable him to apply it, as well to what is not
in the table as to what is in it. I have known scholars study that table faithfully four months,
and then have but an imperfect knowledge of what was in the book. I have known others who,
with one hour's study, after five minutes' instruction in the principles here laid down, understood
the table perfectly, and could recite it, without making a single mistake, even before they
had studied the whole of it once over.

Third. The manner in which reading is generally taught is hardly superior to the modes of instruction
already considered. In many instances, commendable effort is made to secure correct pronunciation,
and a proper observance of the inflections and pauses. But there is a great lack in understanding
what is read. When visiting schools, with the permission of the teacher, I usually interrogate
reading classes with reference to the meaning of what they have read. Occasionally I receive
answers that give satisfactory evidences of correct instruction. Generally, however, the scholars
have no distinct idea concerning the author's meaning. They, astonished, sometimes say, "I
didn't know as the meaning has any thing to do with reading; I try to pronounce the words right,
and mind the stops." Teachers sometimes say their scholars are poor readers, and it takes all
their attention to pronounce their words correctly. They therefore do not wish to have them
try to understand what they read, thinking it would be a hinderance to them. They occasionally
justify themselves in the course they pursue, saying, "I don't have time to question my classes
on their reading, nor hardly time to look over and correct mistakes." At the same time they
will read three or four times around, twice a day or oftener. The idea prevails extensively,
judging from the practice of teachers, that the value of their services depends upon the extent
of the various exercises of the school. If the classes can read several times around, twice
a day, and spell two or three pages, teachers frequently think they have done well, even though
one half of the mistakes in reading are uncorrected, and one fourth or more of the words in
the spelling lessons are misspelled, to say nothing of understanding what is read. The majority
of schools might be very much improved by conducting them upon the principle that "what is
worth doing at all is worth doing well." I am fully satisfied that it is incomparably better
for classes to read once around, once a day, and understand what they read, than to read four
times around, four times a day, without understanding their lessons. Scholars should, indeed,
never be allowed to read what is beyond their comprehension; and great pains should be taken
to see that they actually understand every lesson, and every book read. The early formation
of such a habit will be of incalculable value in after life.

I will introduce one extract from my note-book by way of illustration. The reader will please
observe that it relates to neither a back district nor an inexperienced teacher.

"This is one of the oldest and most important districts in town. The school is taught by an
experienced and highly-reputable teacher. The first class in the English Reader read the section
entitled 'The Journey of a Day; a Picture of Human Life.' Obidah had been contemplating the
beauties of nature, visiting cascades, viewing prospects, etc., and in these amusements the
hours passed away uncounted, till 'day vanished from before him, and a sudden tempest gathered
around his head;' when, it is said, 'he beheld through the brambles the glimmer of a taper.'
I inquired of the class, 'What is a taper?' No one replied. I added, 'It is either the sun,
a light, a house, or a man,' whereupon one replied, 'the sun;' another, 'a house;' another
still, 'a house;' and still another, 'a man.' I next inquired, 'What does glimmer mean?' No
reply being given, I added, 'It either means a light, the shadow, the top, or the bottom.'
They then replied successively as follows: 'Top, shadow, bottom,' which would give their several
ideas of the phrase, 'the glimmer of a taper,' as follows: The shadow of a house. The top of
a man. The bottom of the sun, etc. It should be borne in mind, the class had just read that
this 'taper' was discovered after 'day had vanished from sight.'"

This example is selected from among more than a hundred, scores of which are more striking
illustrations than the one introduced, which is selected because it occurred in the first class
of an important school, taught by an experienced and highly-reputable teacher.

The habit of reading without understanding originates mainly in the circumstance that the books
put into the hands of children are to them uninteresting. The style and matter are often above
their comprehension. It is impossible, for example, for children at an early age to understand
the English Reader, a work which frequently constitutes their only reading-book (at least in
school) when but seven years of age. The English Reader is an excellent book, and would grace
the library of any gentleman. But it requires a better knowledge of language, and more maturity
of mind than is often possessed by children ten years old, to understand it, and to be interested
in its perusal. Hence its use induces the habit of "pronouncing the words and minding the stops,"
with hardly a single successful effort to arrive at the idea of the author. To this early-formed
habit may be traced the prevailing indifference, and, in some instances, aversion to reading,
manifested not only in childhood, but in after life.

The matter and style of the reading-book should be adapted to the capacity and taste of the
learner. The teacher should see that it is well understood, and then it can hardly prove uninteresting,
or be otherwise than well read. Children should read less in school than they ordinarily do,
and greater pains should be taken to have them understand every sentence, and word even, of
what they do read. They will thus become more interested in their reading, and read much more
extensively, not only while young, but in after life, and with incomparably more profit.

Fourth. I have heard several classes in geography bound states and counties with a considerable
degree of accuracy, when none of them could point to the north, south, east, or west. Indeed,
a portion of them were not aware that these terms relate to the four cardinal points of the
compass. Still more: some of them say that "geography is a description of the earth," but they
do not know as they ever saw the earth. They have no idea that they live upon it. Scholars
in grammar frequently think that the only object of the study is to enable them to recite the
definitions and rules, and to parse. They do not look for any assistance in thinking, speaking,
or writing correctly, neither do they expect any aid therefrom in understanding what they read.

Classes in arithmetic not unfrequently think the principal object in pursuing that science
is to be able to do the sums according to the rule, and perhaps to prove them. Propose to them
a practical question for solution, and their reply is, "That isn't in the arithmetic." Some
one more courageous may say, "If you'll tell me what rule it is in, I'll try it!" Practical
questions should be added by the teacher, till the class can readily apply the principles of
each rule to the ordinary transactions of business in which they are requisite. Generally,
in grammar, arithmetic, and elsewhere, there is too much inquiry, comparatively, after the
how, and too little after the why.]

Now if these paragraphs, descriptive of the condition of common schools and the qualifications
of teachers at the commencement of the educational reform in New York, are applicable to those
states of the Union whose provisions for general education are not equal to what hers then
were, nothing can be plainer than that there exists an imperative demand for the establishment
of normal schools in every part of the Union. Massachusetts has three; but her provisions in
this respect are not adequate to her necessities.

Union schools, and systems of graded schools in cities and villages, should possess a normal
characteristic; that is, young men and women who have the requisite natural and acquired ability
should be employed as assistants in the lower departments, and should sustain essentially the
relation of apprenticed teachers, to be promoted or discontinued according as they shall prove
themselves worthy or otherwise. In the public schools of the city of New York there are about
two hundred teachers of this description. These and all the less experienced teachers meet
at a stated time every week for the purpose of receiving normal instruction from a committee
of teachers whose instructions are adapted to their wants. A similar feature has been adopted
in other cities, and in many villages, and should become universal among us.

In connection with the suggestions I have just introduced from a former report, I wish to say,
I know of no reform which is more needed in our schools than that of rendering instruction
at once thorough and practical. The suggestion in the note on the 428th page, in relation to
teaching the alphabet, will admit of general application. As fast as principles are learned,
they should be applied. Practical questions for the exercise of the student should be interspersed
with the lessons in all our text-books, when the nature of the subject will admit of it. When
these are not given by the author, they should be supplied by the teacher.

I will illustrate by an example. Several years ago a teacher had the charge of a class in natural
philosophy. There were no questions in the text-book used for the exercise of the student,
as here recommended. In treating upon the hydraulic press, the author said, in relation to
the force to be obtained by its use, "If a pressure of two tons be given to a piston, the diameter
of which is only a quarter of an inch, the force transmitted to the other piston, if three
feet in diameter, would be upward of forty thousand tons." The teacher inquired of the class,
How much upward of forty thousand tons would the pressure be? Not one in a large class was
prepared to answer the question. Some of the scholars laughed outright at the idea of asking
such a question. After a few familiar remarks by the teacher, the class was dismissed. This
question, however, constituted a part of their review lesson. The next day found it solved
by every member of the class. Several of the scholars said to the teacher that they had derived
more practical information in relation to natural philosophy from the solution of this one
question, than they had previously acquired in studying it several quarters.

In treating upon the velocity of falling bodies, such questions as the following might be asked:
Suppose a body in a vacuum falls sixteen feet the first second, how far will it fall the first
three seconds? How far will it fall the next three seconds? How much further will it fall during
the ninth second than in the fifth? If this paragraph should be read by any teacher or student
of natural philosophy who has not been accustomed thus to apply principles, the author would
suggest that it may be found pleasant and perhaps profitable to pause and solve these questions
before reading further.

The importance of reducing immediately to practice every thing that is learned, is no less
essential in moral and religious education than in physical or intellectual. Indeed, any thing
short of this is jeoparding one's dearest interests; for "to him that knoweth to do good and
doeth it not, to him it is sin." The practical educator should bear in mind that man is susceptible
of progression in his moral and religious nature as well as in his physical and intellectual.
"Cease to do evil; learn to do well," is the Divine command. He who does only the former has
but a negative goodness. The practice of the latter is essential to the healthful condition
of the soul. It is important that we seek earnestly to be "cleansed from secret faults." Without
this, our progress in excellence will at best be slow. While "the way of the wicked is as darkness,
and they stumble at they know not what," it is nevertheless true that "the path of the just
is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day."

Understanding what we do of the nature of man, the subject of education, and knowing that "the
fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," and that the Great Teacher, who "taught as one
having authority," hath said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness," can
we regard it any thing less than consummate folly to enter upon the work of education in the
open neglect of these precepts?

We can not expect the student will excel his teacher, if indeed he equals him, in merely intellectual
pursuits; much less can we reasonably look for superior attainments in morals and religion.
If, then, the teacher would secure the most perfect obedience of his scholars from the highest
motives, he must show them that he himself cheerfully and habitually complies, in heart and
in life, with all the precepts of the Great Teacher, with whom is lodged all authority, and
from whom he derives his. When the members of a school become convinced that their teacher
habitually asks wisdom of the Supreme Educator, whose will he aims constantly to do, they will
feel almost irresistibly urged to yield obedience to the precepts of Christianity, and, with
suitable encouragement, will take upon themselves the easy yoke of Christ.[75]

  [75] In a former chapter, the necessity of moral and religious education
  was dwelt upon at length. The importance of the Scriptures as a
  text-book, containing as they do the only perfect code of morals known
  to man, and the objections sometimes urged against their use, were duly
  considered. I wish here simply to add, that their exclusion from our
  schools would be even more sectarian than their perverted use; for the
  atheistical plan, which forbids the entrance of the Bible into
  multitudes of our schools, under the pretense of excluding sectarianism,
  shuts out Christianity, and establishes the influence of a single
  sect, that would dethrone the Creator, and break up every bond of
  social order.

Even common arithmetic, when well taught, and illustrated by judiciously constructed examples,
may be made not only more practical than it has usually been heretofore, but while the student
is becoming acquainted with the science of numbers, it may be rendered an efficient instrumentality
in showing the advantages of knowledge and virtue, and the expense and burden to the community
of ignorance and crime, thus promoting the great work of moral culture, as is beautifully illustrated
by the following examples, selected from a recent treatise on that subject:

"In the town of Bury, England, with an estimated population of twenty-five thousand, the expenditure
for beer and spirits, in the year 1836, was estimated at £54,190. If this was 24 per cent.
of the entire loss, resulting from the waste of money, ill health, loss of labor, and the other
evils attendant upon intoxication, what was the average loss from intemperance, for each man,
woman, and child in the place, estimating the pound sterling at $4.80. Ans. $43,332."

This one example may do more, in many instances, toward establishing young men who may be engaged
in its solution in habits of total abstinence, than a score of lectures on temperance, or as
many lessons on domestic or political economy. The following, also, may more effectually check
existing abuses of some of the laws of health and longevity than a month's study of physiology
and moral science: "It has been estimated that a man, in a properly ventilated room, can work
twelve hours a day with no greater inconvenience than would be occasioned by ten hours' work
in a room badly ventilated; and that, where there is proper ventilation, a man may gain ten
years' good labor on account of unimpaired health. According to this estimate, what is the
loss in thirty years to each individual in a badly-ventilated work-shop, valuing the labor
at ten cents per hour? Ans. $5008." What an astonishing result! Five thousand and eight dollars
moneyed loss to each individual who respires impure air, estimating labor at but ten cents an hour.

Now suppose this loss occurs only in the case of the eight hundred thousand voters in the United
States who are unable to read and write--and it must accrue to a much greater number of persons--and
one fourth of the annual loss would be sufficient to maintain an efficient system of common
schools in every state of the Union the entire year.

It has sometimes been said, even by individuals occupying high stations in society, that persons
of the second or third order of intellect make the best school-teachers. But in the light of
what has been said, this statement needs but be made to prove its fallacy. In order properly
to fill the teachers' office, we need men and women of the first order of intellect, brought
to a high state of cultivation. A well-qualified and faithful school-teacher earns, and of
right ought to receive, a salary equal to that paid to the clergyman, or received by the members
of the other learned professions. He who can teach a good school can ordinarily engage with
proportionate success in more lucrative pursuits. So true is this remark, that scarcely a man
can be found that has attained to any considerable eminence as a teacher, who has not been
repeatedly solicited, and perhaps strongly tempted, to relinquish teaching and engage in pursuits
less laborious and more profitable. Many yield to this temptation, and hence much of the best
talent has been attracted to the other professions. School committees, however, can generally
secure the services of teachers of any grade of qualifications they desire, upon the simple
condition of offering an adequate remuneration.

We have said, as is the teacher so will be the school. We might add, as are the wages, so ordinarily
is the teacher. Let it be understood that in any township, county, or state, a high order of
teachers is called for, and that an adequate remuneration will be given, and the demand will
be supplied. Well-qualified teachers will be called in from abroad until competent ones can
be trained up at home. Here, as in other departments of labor, as is the demand, so will be
the supply.

The best means which citizens can employ to give character and stability to the vocation of
the teacher is to select competent and worthy individuals to take the charge of their schools,
and then pay them so liberally that they can have no pecuniary inducement to change their employment.
Let this be generally done, and teaching will soon be raised, in public estimation, to the
rank of a learned profession; and the fourth learned profession--the vocation of the practical
educator--will be taken up for life by as great a proportion of men and women eminent for talent,
cultivation, and moral worth, as either of the other three professions have ever been able
to boast.

SCHOOLS SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE YEAR.

    Schools should be kept open at least ten full months during the
    year; in other words, the entire year, with the usual quarterly or
    semi-annual vacations.--Michigan School Report.

It is not enough that good school-houses be provided and well-qualified teachers be employed.
Our schools should be kept open a sufficient length of time during the year to make their influence
strongly and most favorably felt. The work of instruction, while it is going forward, should
be the business of both teachers and scholars. If children are habituated to industry, to close
application, to hard study, and to good personal, social, and moral habits during the period
of their attendance upon school, these habits will be favorably felt in after life, in the
development of characters whose possessors will be at once respectable and useful members of
society, and a blessing to the age in which they live. On the contrary, if children are allowed
to attend an indifferent school three months during the year, to work three months, to play
three months, and are permitted to spend the remaining three months in idleness, the influence
of this course will be felt, and it will be likely to give character to their future lives.

Under such circumstances, the good, if any, that children will receive while attending an indifferent
school one fourth of the year, will be more than counterbalanced by the evil influences that
surround them during the half of the year they devote to play and idleness. We can not reasonably
expect that children brought up under such unfavorable and distracting influences will become
even respectable members of society, much less that they will be a blessing to the generation
in which they live. And, I may add, the same teacher should be retained in the charge of a
school, wherever practicable, from year to year. The teacher occupies, for the time being,
the place of the parent. But what kind of government and discipline should we expect in a family
where a new step-father or step-mother is introduced and invested with parental authority every
six months, and where the children are left in orphanage half of the year! Much more may we
inquire, what kind of instruction and educational training may we reasonably expect in a large
school whose wants are no better provided for! A school-teacher should be selected with as
great care as the minister of the parish; and when selected, the services of the one should
be continued as uninterruptedly and permanently as those of the other. Then will be beautifully
illustrated this interesting truth: It is easier, cheaper, and pleasanter incomparably, and
infinitely more effectual, rightly to train the rising generation, than it is to reform men
grown old in sin.

Lalor, in his prize essay on education, published ten years ago in London, has recorded a kindred
sentiment in this very beautiful and highly-expressive language: "The schoolmaster alone, going
forth with the power of intelligence and a moral purpose among the infant minds of the community,
can stop the flood of vice and crime at its source, by repressing in childhood those wild passions
which are its springs. Nay, often will the mature mind, hard as adamant against the terrors
of the law and the contempt of society, be softened to tears of penitence by the innocence
of its educated child speaking unconscious reproof."

                *       *       *       *       *

EVERY CHILD SHOULD ATTEND SCHOOL.

    The plan of this nation was not, and is not, to see how many
    individuals we can raise up who shall be distinguished, but to see
    how high, by free schools and free institutions, we can raise the
    great mass of population.--REV. JOHN TODD.

    I promised God that I would look upon every Prussian peasant child
    as a being who could complain of me before God if I did not provide
    for him the best education, as a man and a Christian, which it was
    possible for me to provide.--SCHOOL-COUNSELOR DINTER.

Good school-houses maybe built, well-qualified teachers may be employed, and schools may be
kept open the entire year, but all this will not secure the correct education of the people,
unless those schools are patronized; patronized, not by a few persons, not by one half, or
three fourths even of a community, but by the whole community. As was said in a former chapter,
there is no safety but in the education of the masses. A few vile persons will taint and infect
a whole neighborhood. In the graphic language of the Scriptures, One sinner destroyeth much good.

The better portions of the community every where provide for the education of their children.
If they are not instructed at home, they are sent to good schools, public or private, where
their education is well looked after. Unfortunately, those children whose education is most
neglected at home are the very ones, usually, that are sent least to school, and when at all,
to the poorest schools.

But how shall the evil in question be remedied? How shall we secure the attendance of children
generally at the schools, provided good ones are established? In the first place, diligent
effort should be made to arouse the public mind to an appreciation of the importance and necessity
of universal attendance. This will go far toward remedying the evil. It should be made every
where unpopular, and be regarded as dishonorable in a member of our social compact, and unworthy
of a citizen of a free state, to bring up a child without giving him such an education as shall
fit him for the discharge of the duties of an American citizen.

But there is a portion of almost every community who feel hardly able to allow their children
the necessary time to pursue an extended course of common school education, and who are really
unable to clothe them properly, furnish them with useful books, and pay their tuition. This
class, although comparatively small, is not unimportant. The legal provisions made for such
children vary in different states. Wherever the free school principle is adopted, their tuition
is of course provided for. This provision in some instances extends further. The statutes of
Michigan relating to primary schools make it the duty of the district board to exempt from
the payment of teachers' wages not only, but from providing fuel for the use of the district,
all such persons residing therein as in their opinion ought to be exempted, and to admit the
children of such persons to the school free of charge not only, but the district board is authorized
to purchase, at the expense of the district, such books as may be necessary for the use of
children thus admitted by them to the district school. The entire expense incurred for tuition,
fuel, and books, in such cases, is assumed by the district, and paid by a tax levied upon the
property thereof.

We have now arrived at an interesting crisis. We have exhausted the legal provision, generous
as it is, and yet the blessing of universal education is not secured to those who will succeed
us. Good schools may every where be established, in which the wealthy, and those in comfortable
circumstances, may educate their children. Provision--yes, generous provision, though but just--has
been made to meet the expense of tuition and books for the children of indigent parents. Still,
they may not sufficiently appreciate an education to send their children; or, if this be not
so, they may keep them at home from motives of delicacy, being unable to clothe them decently.
How shall such cases be met? How shall we actually bring such children into the peaceable possession
and enjoyment of a good common school education, that rich legacy which noble-minded legislators
have bequeathed to them, and which is the inalienable right of every son and daughter of this
republic?

Legislation has already, in many of the states, done much--perhaps all that can be reasonably
expected, at least, until a good common education shall be better appreciated by the community
at large, and be ranked, as it ought to be, among the necessaries of life. The work, then,
must be consummated chiefly by the united and well-directed efforts of benevolent and philanthropic
individuals.

Benevolent females--and especially Christian mothers, who have long been pre-eminently distinguished
for their successful efforts in protecting the innocent, administering to the wants of the
necessitous, and reclaiming the wanderer from the paths of vice--have felt the claims of this
innocent and unoffending portion of the community, and have, in some instances, organized themselves
into associations to meet those claims.

Benevolent and Christian females can doubtless accomplish more, by visiting the poor and needy
in their respective school districts, and making known unto them their privileges, and encouraging
and assisting them, if need be, to avail themselves of these privileges, than by the same expenditure
of time and means in any other way. They have long and very generally been accustomed to clothe
the children of the destitute, and accompany them to the Sunday-school, and there teach them
those things which pertain to their present and everlasting well-being, and have thus accomplished
incalculable good; but by co-operating with the civil authorities in securing the attendance
of every child in their respective districts at the improved common school, they can hardly
fail to accomplish vastly more.

Several associations have been formed for this noble purpose, and many children who, but for
their fostering care, would have remained at their cheerless homes, have, by this labor of
love, been sought out, properly cared for, and led to the common school, that fountain of intellectual
life, and of social and moral culture, which is alike open to all. Gentlemen should everywhere
encourage the formation of such associations, and, when formed, should offer every facility
in their power to increase their usefulness. Clergymen might help forward such benevolent labors,
where they are entered upon, by preaching occasionally from that good text, Help those women.

But there are two classes of our fellow-citizens--perhaps I should say fellow-beings--who,
notwithstanding the abundant legal provisions to which I have referred, and the utmost that
the benevolent and philanthropic can accomplish by voluntary effort, will utterly refuse to
give their children such an education as we have been contemplating. These are, first, men
in comfortable circumstances, who have so much blindness of mind, and such an utter disregard
for the welfare of their offspring, as to deprive them of the advantages of even a common school
education; and, secondly, those who have such an obduracy of heart as absolutely to refuse
to allow their children to attend school, and who, although the abundant provisions of the
law are made known unto them, in meekness and love, by "man's guardian angel," prove utterly
incorrigible.

Such persons are unworthy to sustain the parental relation, and the safety of the community
requires that the forfeiture be claimed, and that the right of control be transferred from
such unnatural parents to the civil authorities; for, as Kent says, "A parent who sends his
son into the world uneducated, and without skill in any art or science, does a great injury
to mankind as well as to his own family, for he defrauds the community of a useful citizen,
and bequeaths to it a nuisance." How true is it that "the mobs, the riots, the burnings, the
lynchings perpetrated by the men of the present day, are perpetrated because of their vicious
or defective education when children! We see and feel the havoc and the ravage of their tiger
passions now, when they are full grown, but it was years ago that they were whelped and suckled."

In the very expressive language of Macaulay, the right to HANG includes the right to EDUCATE.
This is not a strange nor a new idea. It long ago entered into civil codes in the Old World
not only, but in the New. In Prussia, when a parent refuses, without satisfactory excuse, to
send his child to school the time required by law, he is cited before the court, tried, and,
if he refuses compliance, the child is taken from him and sent to school, and the father to prison.

Similar laws were enacted and enforced by our New England fathers more than two hundred years
ago, which history informs us were attended with the most beneficial results.[76] Although
their descendants of the present generation should blush for their degeneracy, still we should
be encouraged from an increasing disposition of late to return to these salutary restraints
and needful checks upon ignorance and crime. Said the Honorable Josiah Quincy, Jr., late mayor
of the city of Boston, in his inaugural address, "I hold that the state has a right to compel
parents to take advantage of the means of educating their children. If it can punish them for
crime, it should surely have the power of preventing them from committing it, by giving them
the habits and the education that are the surest safeguards." Similar sentiments have been
recently promulgated by the heads of the school departments of several states in their official
reports, and by governors in their annual messages; and we have much reason for believing that
the time is not distant when an enlightened public sentiment shall demand the re-enactment
of these most salutary laws of our ancestors.

  [76] The following paragraph is from the Massachusetts Colony Laws of
  1642; "Forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular behoof
  and benefit to any commonwealth, and whereas many parents and masters
  are too indolent and negligent of their duty in that kind, it is ordered
  that the select-men of every town in the several precincts and quarters,
  where they dwell, shall have a vigilant eye over their brethren and
  neighbors, to see, first, that none of them shall suffer so much
  barbarism in any of their families as not to teach, by themselves or
  others, their children and apprentices so much learning as may enable
  them perfectly to read the English tongue, and knowledge of the capital
  laws, upon penalty of twenty shillings for each neglect therein."

COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE UPON SCHOOL.--Since the preceding paragraphs were prepared for the printer,
the author has received the statutes and resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature of 1850,
relating to education, which recognize the principle here contended for. Each of the several
cities and towns in that commonwealth is "authorized and empowered to make all needful provisions
and arrangements concerning habitual truants, and children not attending school, without any
regular and lawful occupation, growing up in ignorance, between the ages of six and fifteen
years; and, also, all such ordinances and by-laws respecting such children as shall be deemed
most conducive to their welfare and the good order of such city or town; and there shall be
annexed to such ordinances suitable penalties, not exceeding, for any one breach, a fine of
twenty dollars."

It is made the duty of the "several cities and towns availing themselves of the provisions
of this act, to appoint, at the annual meetings of said towns, or annually by the mayor and
aldermen of said cities, three or more persons, who alone shall be authorized to make the complaints,
in every case of violation of said ordinances or by-laws, to the justice of the peace, or other
judicial officer, who, by said ordinances, shall have jurisdiction in the matter, which persons
thus appointed shall alone have authority to carry into execution the judgments of said justices
of the peace, or other judicial officer."

It is further provided that "the said justices of the peace, or other judicial officer, shall,
in all cases, at their discretion, in place of the fine aforesaid, be authorized to order children
proved before them to be growing up in truancy, and without the benefit of the education provided
for them by law, to be placed, for such periods of time as they may judge expedient, in such
institution of instruction, or house of reformation, or other suitable situation, as may be
assigned or provided for the purpose in each city or town availing itself of the powers herein
granted."

This principle has been incorporated into several municipal codes. Children in the city of
Boston, under sixteen years of age, whose "parents are dead, or, if living, do, from vice,
or any other cause, neglect to provide suitable employment for, or to exercise salutary control
over" them, may be sent by the court to the house of reformation. By the late act, establishing
the State Reform School, male convicts under sixteen years of age may be sent to this school
from any part of the commonwealth, to be there "instructed in piety and morality, and in such
branches of useful knowledge as shall be adapted to their age and capacity." The inmates may
be bound out; but, in executing this part of their duty, the trustees "shall have scrupulous
regard to the religious and moral character of those to whom they are bound, to the end that
they may secure to the boys the benefit of a good example, and wholesome instruction, and the
sure means of improvement in virtue and knowledge, and thus the opportunity of becoming intelligent,
moral, useful, and happy citizens of the commonwealth."

The Massachusetts State Reform School is designed to be a "school for the instruction, reformation,
and employment of juvenile offenders." Any boy under sixteen years of age, "convicted of any
offense punishable by imprisonment other than for life," may be sentenced to this school. Here
he may be kept during the term of his sentence; or he may be bound out as an apprentice; or,
in case he proves incorrigible, he may be sent to prison, as he would originally have been
but for the existence of this school.

The buildings erected are sufficiently large for three hundred boys. Attached to the establishment
is a large farm, the cost of all which, when the buildings are completed and furnished, and
the farm stocked and provided with agricultural implements, it is estimated will be about one
hundred thousand dollars. A citizen of that state has given twenty-two thousand five hundred
dollars to this institution, partly to defray past expenses and partly to form a fund for its
future benefit.

"In visiting this noble institution, one can not but think how closely it resembles, in spirit
and in purpose, the mission of Him who came to seek and to save that which was lost; and yet,
in traversing its spacious halls and corridors, the echo of each footfall seems to say that
one tenth part of its cost would have done more in the way of prevention than its whole amount
can accomplish in the way of reclaiming, and would, besides, have saved a thousand pangs that
have torn parental hearts, and a thousand more wounds in the hearts of the children themselves,
which no human power can ever wholly heal. When will the state learn that it is better to spend
its units for prevention than tens and hundreds for remedy? How long must the state, like those
same unfortunate children, suffer the punishment of THEIR existence before IT will be reformed?"

Kindred institutions have existed in several of our principal cities for a quarter of a century,
among which are the House of Reformation for Juvenile Delinquents in New York, the House of
Refuge in Philadelphia, and the House of Reformation in Boston. Considering the degradation
of their parents, the absence of correct early instruction, and the corrupting influences to
which the children sent to these institutions have been exposed, becoming generally criminals
before any effort has been made by the humane for their correct educational training, one may
well wonder at the success which has crowned the efforts that have been put forth in their
behalf, for the greater part of them are effectually and permanently reformed. This, however,
only shows more clearly the power of education, and the advantages that may be derived from
the establishment and maintenance of improved common schools throughout our country.

But how are these reforms effected? The means are simple, and are slightly different from those
already described for the correct training of unoffending children. Take, for instance, the
House of Reformation in the City of New York. In the first place, they have a good school-house,
embracing nearly all the modern improvements. The yard and play-ground are of ample dimensions,
and are inclosed by a substantial fence. This constitutes a barrier beyond which the children,
once within, can not pass. But the clean gravel-walks, the beautiful shade-trees, the green
grass-plats, the sparkling fountains, the ornamental flower-garden, all conspire to render
the place delightful. It is, indeed, a prison in one sense, but the children seem hardly to
know it. Then, again, well-qualified teachers and superintendents are employed. The spirit
which actuates them is that of love. By proving themselves the friends of the children, the
children become their friends, and are hence easily governed, considering their former neglect.
Being well instructed, they love study, and generally make commendable progress. Their habits
are regular, and they are constantly employed. A portion of the day is devoted to study; another
portion to industrial pursuits; and still another to recreation and amusements. Strict obedience
is required. This may be yielded at first from restraint, but ultimately from love. The love
of kind and faithful teachers, the love of approving consciences, the love of right, the love
of God, separately and conjointly influence them, until they can say ultimately of a truth,
"The love of Christ constraineth us."

Their industrial habits are of incalculable benefit to them. They all learn some trade, and
acquire the habits and the skill requisite to constitute them producers, and thus practically
conform to this fundamental law, "that if any man would not work, neither should he eat." The
other conditions that have been stated as essential to success are also complied with, the
scholars being kept under the influence of good teachers, and of the same teachers from year
to year, during their continuance in the institution.

The well-qualified and eminently successful teacher who has long been connected with the Refuge
in New York, in a late report says, "The habits of industry which the children here acquire
will be of incalculable benefit to them through life. Yet we look upon the School Department
as the greatest of all the means employed to save our youthful charge from ignorance and vice.
As it is the mind and the heart that are mostly depraved, so we must act mostly upon the mind
and the heart to eradicate this depravity.

"The education here is a moral education. We do endeavor, it is true, by all the powers we
possess, to impress upon the mind the great importance of a good education; and not only to
impress it upon the mind, but to assist the mind to act, that it may obtain it. But our principal
aim is to fan into life the almost dying spark of virtue, and kindle anew the moral feelings,
that they may glow with fresh ardor, and shine forth again in the beauty of innocence. Our
object is not to store the memory with facts, but to elevate the soul; not to think for the
children, but to teach them to think for themselves; to describe the road, and put them in
the way; never to hint what they have been, nor what they are, but to point them continually
to what they may be.

"We feel assured that our labor will not be lost. Judging the future from the past, we are
sanguine in our belief that our toils have left an impress upon the mind which time can not
efface. Scarcely a week passes but our hearts are cheered and animated, and our eyes are gladdened
at the sight of those whom we taught in by-gone years, who bid no fairer then to cheer us than
those with whom we labor now. Yet they are saved--saved to themselves; saved to society; saved
to their friends--who, but for this Refuge, would have poisoned the moral atmosphere of our
land, and breathed around them more deadly effluvia than that of the fabled Upas."

The success which has attended well-directed efforts for the reformation of juvenile delinquents,
and evening free schools for the education of adults of all ages whose early education has
been neglected, ought to inspire the friends of human improvement with increased confidence
in the redeeming power of a correct early education, such as every state in this Union may
provide for all her children. When this confidence is begotten, and when a good common education
comes to be generally regarded as the birth-right of every child in the community, then may
the friends of free institutions and of indefinite human advancement look for the more speedy
realization of their long-cherished hopes. For one generation the community must be doubly
taxed--once in the reformation of juvenile delinquents, and in the education of ignorant adults
in evening schools, and again in the correct training of all our children in improved schools.
This done, each succeeding generation will come upon the stage under more favorable circumstances
than the preceding, and each present generation will be better prepared to educate that which
is to follow, to the end of time.

THE REDEEMING POWER OF COMMON SCHOOLS.

    If all our schools were under the charge of teachers possessing what
    I regard as the right intellectual and moral qualifications, and if
    all the children of the community were brought under the influence
    of these schools for ten months in the year, I think that the work
    of training up THE WHOLE COMMUNITY to intelligence and virtue would
    soon be accomplished, as completely as any human end can be obtained
    by human means.--REV. JACOB ABBOTT.

I might here introduce a vast amount of incontrovertible evidence to show that, if the attendance
of all the children in any commonwealth could be secured at such improved common schools as
we have been contemplating for ten months during the year, from the age of four to that of
sixteen years, they would prove competent to the removal of ninety-nine one hundredths of the
evils with which society is now infested in one generation, and that they would ultimately
redeem the state from social vices and crimes.

The Hon. Horace Mann, late Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, issued a circular
in 1847, in which he raised the question now under consideration. This circular was sent out
to a large number of the most experienced and reputable teachers in the Northern and Middle
States, all of whom were pleased to reply to it. Each reply corroborates the position here
stated; and, taken together as a whole, they are entitled to implicit credence. The whole correspondence
is too voluminous to be here exhibited; I can not, however, forbear introducing a few illustrative
passages.

Says Mr. Page, the late lamented principal of the New York State Normal School, "Could I be
connected with a school furnished with all the appliances you name; where all the children
should be constant attendants upon my instruction for a succession of years; where all my fellow-teachers
should be such as you suppose; and where all the favorable influences described in your circular
should surround me and cheer me, even with my moderate abilities as a teacher, I should scarcely
expect, after the first generation submitted to the experiment, to fail in a single case to
secure the results you have named."

Mr. Solomon Adams, of Boston, who has been engaged in the profession of teaching twenty-four
years, remarks as follows: "Permit me to say that, in very many cases, after laboring long
with individuals almost against hope, and sometimes in a manner, too, which I can now see was
not always wise, I have never had a case which has not resulted in some good degree according
to my wishes. The many kind and voluntary testimonials given years afterward by persons who
remembered that they were once my way-ward pupils, are among the pleasantest and most cheering
incidents of my life. So uniform have been the results, when I have had a fair trial and time
enough, that I have unhesitatingly adopted the motto, Never despair. Parents and teachers are
apt to look for too speedy results from the labors of the latter. The moral nature, like the
intellectual and physical, is long and slow in reaching the full maturity of its strength.
I was told a few years since by a person who knew the history of nearly all my pupils for the
first five years of my labor, that not one of them had ever brought reproach upon himself or
mortification upon friends by a bad life. I can not now look over the whole of my pupils, and
find one who had been with me long enough to receive a decided impression, whose life is not
honorable and useful. I find them in all the learned professions and in the various mechanical
arts. I find my female pupils scattered as teachers through half the states of the Union, and
as the wives and assistants of Christian missionaries in every quarter of the globe.

"So far, therefore, as my own experience goes, so far as my knowledge of the experience of
others extends, so far as the statistics of crime throw any light upon the subject, I confidently
expect that ninety-nine in a hundred, and I think even more, with such means of education as
you have supposed, and with such Divine favor as we are authorized to expect, would become
good members of society, the supporters of order, and law, and truth, and justice, and all
righteousness."

The Rev. Jacob Abbott, who has been engaged in the practical duties of teaching for about ten
years in the cities of Boston and New York, and who has had under his care about eight hundred
pupils of both sexes, and of all ages from four to twenty-five, has expressed in a long letter
the sentiment placed at the head of this section.

Mr. Roger S. Howard, of Vermont, who has been engaged in teaching about twenty years, remarks,
among other things, as follows: "Judging from what I have seen and do know, if the conditions
you have mentioned were strictly complied with; if the attendance of the scholars could be
as universal, constant, and long-continued as you have stated; if the teachers were men and
women of those high intellectual and moral qualities--apt to teach, and devoted to their work,
and favored with that blessing which the word and providence of God teach us always to expect
upon our honest, earnest, and well-directed efforts in so good a cause--on these conditions
and under these circumstances, I do not hesitate to express the opinion that the failures need
not be--would not be one per cent."

Miss Catharine E. Beecher, of Brattleboro, Vermont, who has been engaged directly and personally
as a teacher about fifteen years, in Hartford, Connecticut, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and who has
had the charge of not less than a thousand pupils from every state in the Union, after stating
these and other considerations, remarks as follows: "I will now suppose that it could be so
arranged that, in a given place, containing from ten to fifteen thousand inhabitants, in any
part of the country where I ever resided, all the children at the age of four shall be placed
six hours a day, for twelve years, under the care of teachers having the same views that I
have, and having received that course of training for their office that any state in this Union
can secure to the teachers of its children. Let it be so arranged that all these children shall
remain till sixteen under these teachers, and also that they shall spend their lives in this
city, and I have no hesitation in saying I do not believe that one, no, NOT A SINGLE ONE, would
fail of proving a respectable and prosperous member of society; nay, more, I believe every
one would, at the close of life, find admission into the world of endless peace and love. I
say this solemnly, deliberately, and with the full belief that I am upheld by such imperfect
experimental trials as I have made, or seen made by others; but, more than this, that I am
sustained by the authority of Heaven, which sets forth this grand palladium of education, 'Train
up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.

"This sacred maxim surely sets the Divine imprimatur to the doctrine that all children can
be trained up in the way they should go, and that, when so trained, they will not depart from
it. Nor does it imply that education alone will secure eternal life without supernatural assistance;
but it points to the true method of securing this indispensable aid.

"In this view of the case, I can command no language strong enough to express my infinite longings
that my countrymen, who, as legislators, have the control of the institutions, the laws, and
the wealth of our physically prosperous nation, should be brought to see that they now have
in their hands the power of securing to every child in the coming generation a life of virtue
and usefulness here, and an eternity of perfected bliss hereafter. How, then, can I express,
or imagine, the awful responsibility which rests upon them, and which hereafter they must bear
before the great Judge of nations, if they suffer the present state of things to go on, bearing,
as it does, thousands and hundreds of thousands of helpless children in our country to hopeless
and irretrievable ruin!"

Testimony similar to the preceding might be multiplied to almost any extent. Enough, however,
I trust, has been said to remove any doubts in relation to the redeeming power of education
which the reader may have previously entertained. Universal education, we have seen, constitutes
the most effectual and the only sure means of securing to individuals and communities, to states
and nations, exemption from all avoidable evils of whatever kind, and the possession of a competency
of this world's goods, with the ability and disposition so to enjoy them as most to augment
human happiness. Yes, education, and nothing short of it, will dissipate the evils of ignorance;
it will greatly increase the productiveness of labor, and make men more moral, industrious,
and skillful, and thus diminish pauperism and crime, while at the same time it will indefinitely
augment the sum total of human happiness. By diminishing the number of fatal accidents that
are constantly occurring in every community, and securing to the rising generation such judicious
physical and moral treatment as shall give them sound minds in sound bodies, it will lay an
unfailing foundation for general prosperity, will greatly promote longevity, and will thus,
in both of these and in many other ways, do more to increase the population, wealth, and universal
well-being of the thirty states of this Union than all other means of state policy combined.

At the late Peace Convention at Paris to consider the practicability and necessity of a Congress
of Nations to adjust national differences, composed of about fifteen hundred members, picked
men from every Christian nation, VICTOR HUGO, the President of the Convention, on taking the
chair, made an address that was received with great applause, in which the following passages
occur:

"A day will come when men will no longer bear arms one against the other; when appeals will
no longer be made to war, but to civilization! The time will come when the cannon will be exhibited
as an old instrument of torture, and wonder expressed how such a thing could have been used.
A day, I say, will come when the United States of America and the United States of Europe will
be seen extending to each other the hand of fellowship across the ocean, and when we shall
have the happiness of seeing every where the majestic radiation of universal concord."

That such a time will come, every heart that glows with Christian benevolence must earnestly
desire and fervently pray. But we can not hope to attain the end without the use of the necessary
means. So glorious a result as this, that has become an object of universal desire throughout
Christendom, must follow when the conditions upon which it depends are complied with. What
these are there can be little room for doubt. Let, then, every friend of Universal Peace seek
it in the use of the appropriate means--Universal Education.

The same remark will apply to every form of Christian benevolence and universal philanthropy;
for, as has been well remarked, in universal education, every "follower of God and friend of
human kind" will find the only sure means of carrying forward that particular reform to which
he is devoted. In whatever department of philanthropy he may be engaged, he will find that
department to be only a segment of the great circle of beneficence of which Universal Education
is the center and circumference; and that he can most successfully promote the permanent advancement
of his most cherished interest in securing the establishment of, and attendance upon, IMPROVED
SCHOOLS FREE TO ALL.
