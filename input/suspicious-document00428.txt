FOREWORD

There are two immortal imbecilities that I have no patience for.

The other one is the treatment of little towns as if they were essentially different from big
towns. Cities are not "Ninevehs" and "Babylons" any more than little towns are Arcadias or
Utopias. In fact we are now unearthing plentiful evidence of what might have been safely assumed,
that Babylon never was a "Babylon" nor Nineveh a "Nineveh" in the sense employed by poets and
praters without number. Those old cities were made up of assorted souls as good and as bad
and as mixed as now.

They do small towns a grievous injustice who deny them restlessness, vice, ostentation, cruelty;
as they do cities a grievous injustice who deny them simplicity, homeliness, friendship, and
contentment. It is one of those undeniable facts (which everybody denies) that a city is only
a lot of small towns put together. Its population is largely made up of people who came from
small towns and of people who go back to small towns every evening.

A village is simply a quiet street in the big city of the world. Quaint, sweet happenings take
place in the avenues most thronged, and desperate events come about in sleepy lanes. People
are people, chance is chance.

My novels have mainly concerned themselves with New York, and I have tried therein to publish
bits of its life as they appear to such eyes and such mind as I have. Though several of my
short stories have been published in single volumes, this is the first group to be issued.
They are all devoted to small-town people. In them I have sought the same end as in the city
novels: to be true to truth, to observe with sympathy and explain with fidelity, to find the
epic of a stranger's existence and shape it for the eyes of strangers--to pass the throb of
another heart through my heart to your heart.

The scene of these stories lies pretty close to the core of these United States, in the Middle
West, in the valley of the Mississippi River. I was born near that river and spent a good deal
of my boyhood in it.

Though it would be unfair, false, and unkind to fasten these stories on any definite originals,
they are centered in the region about the small city of Keokuk, Iowa, from which one can also
see into Illinois, and into Missouri, where I was born. Comic poets have found something comic
in the name of Keokuk, as in other town names in which the letter "K" is prominent. Why "K"
should be so humorous, I can't imagine. The name of Keokuk, however, belonged to a splendid
Indian chief who was friendly to the early settlers and saved them from massacre. The monument
over his bones in the park, on the high bluff there, now commands one of the noblest views
in the world, a great lake formed in the Mississippi River by a dam which is as beautiful as
if the Greeks had built it. It was, in fact, built by a thousand Greeks who camped there for
years. As an engineering achievement it rivals the Assouan dam and as a manufacturer of electricity
it is a second to Niagara Falls. But it has not yet materially disturbed the rural quality
of the country.

The scenery thereabout is very beautiful, but I guarantee you against landscape in these stories.
I cannot, however, guarantee that the stories are even based on fact. Yet I hope that they
are truth.

The characters are limited to a small neighborhood, but if they are not also faithful to humanity
in general, then, as we would say out there, "I miss my guess." 

                                                      A proposed method is by schools of domestic arts, but, valuable as these
are, they are but subsidiary aids to the establishment of homes;
for real the foundation and not the cap- stone of popular education.
Strange is it not, my brothers, how homes are primarily centers of
ideals and teaching and only incidentally centers of fix.

The restoration and raising of home ideals must, then, come from social
life among Negroes and does that social life need no leadership?
It needs the best possible leadership of pure hearts and develop
heads, the highest leadership of carefully trained men.

Such are the arguments for the Negro college, and such is the work
that Atlanta University and a few similar institutions seek to do.

We believe that a rationally arranged college course of study for men and
women able to pursue it is the best and only method of putting seen
in the work of our graduates precisely such results as I have mentioned:
successful of teachers, intelligent and upright ministers, skilled
physicians, principals of industrial schools, business men, and above
all, makers of model homes and leaders of social groups, out from
which radiate subtle but tangible forces of uplift and inspiration.

The proof of scattered in every State of the South, and, above all,
in the half- unwilling testimony of men disposed to decry our work. Between
the Negro college and industrial school there are the strongest grounds
for co- operation and unity. It is not to matter of mere emphasis, for we
would be glad to see ten industrial schools to every college. It is
not a fact that there are to- day too few Negro colleges, but rather
that there are too many institutions attempting to do college work.

But the danger lies in the fact that the best of the Negro colleges
are equipped are to- day losing support and countenance, and that,
unless the nation awakens to its duty, ten years will see the annihilation
of higher Negro training in the South. We need a few strong, well-
equipped Negro colleges, and we need them now, not- morrow; unless we can
have them and have them decently supported, Negro education in the South,
both common- school and industrial, is doomed to failure, and the forces
of social regeneration will years we have strong!""

Know be fatally weakened, for the college to- day among Negroes is,
just as truly as it was yesterday among whites, the beginning and not
the end of human training not, often in America those great watchwords
of human energy--"

Be into the world Negroes with ability to use the social forces of their race so as to stamp out
crime, strengthen the home, eliminate degenerates, and inspire and
encourage the higher tendencies of the race not only in and aspiration
but in every- day toil.

And we believe this, not simply because we have argued themselves; that
such training this lies ought to have these effects, or merely because
we hope for such results in some dim future, but because already for
thyself!"

 Now she took after
him, with her aggressive beauty for a club and her engaging smiles for a net. She asked him
to take her to the Sunday-school picnic, and asked him what he liked best for her to put in
for him. She informed him that she was going to cook it for herself and everybody said she
could fry chicken something grand. So he chose fried chicken.

He was so overjoyed that it was hard for him to be as solemn about the house as he ought to
have been, in view of the fact that Uncle Loren had been taken suddenly and violently ill.
Eddie was the natural heir to the old man's fortune.

Uncle Loren was considered close in a town where extravagance was almost impossible, but where
rigid economy was supposed to pile up tremendous wealth. Hitherto it had pained Uncle Loren
to devote a penny to anything but the sweet uses of investment. Now it suddenly occurred to
the old miser that he had invested nothing in the securities of New Jerusalem, Limited. He
was frightened immeasurably.

In his youth he had joined the Campbellite church and had been baptized in the town pond when
there was a crust of ice over it which the pastor had to break with a stick before he immersed
Loren. Everybody said the crust of ice had stuck to his heart ever since.

In the panic that came on him now he craftily decided to transfer all his savings to the other
shore. The factory, of course, he must leave behind; but he drafted a hasty will presenting
all his money to the Campbellite church under conditions that he counted on to gain him a high
commercial rating in heaven.

Over his shoulder, as he wrote, a shadow waited, grinning; and the old man had hardly folded
his last testament and stuffed it into his pillow-slip when the grisly hand was laid on his
shoulders and Uncle Loren was no longer there.

II

His uncle's demise cut Eddie out of the picnic with Luella; but she was present at the funeral
and gave him a wonderful smile. Uncle Loren's final will was not discovered until the pillow-slip
was sent to the wash; and at the funeral Eddie was still the object of more or less disguised
congratulations as an important heir.

Luella solaced him with rare tact and tenderness, and spoke much of his loneliness and his
need of a helpmate. Eddie resolved to ask her to marry him as soon as he could compose the speech.

Some days later Uncle Loren's farewell will turned up, and Eddie fell from grace with a thump.
The town laughed at him, as people always laugh when a person--particularly so plump a person
as Eddie was--falls hard on the slippery sidewalk of this icy world.

In his dismay he hastened to Luella for sympathy, but she turned up missing. She jilted him
with a jolt that knocked his heart out of his mouth. He stood, as it were, gaping stupidly,
in the middle of the highway.

Then Ellaphine Govers came along, picked his heart out of the road, dusted it, and offered
it back. He was so grateful that he asked her to keep it for him. He was so pitiable an object
that he felt honored even by the support of Ellar Govers.

He went with Ellar quite a lot. He found her very comfortable company. She seemed flattered
by his attention. Other people acted as if they were doing him a favor by letting him stand around.

He had lost Uncle Loren's money, but he still had a small job at the factory. Partly to please
Ellar and partly to show certain folks that he was not yet dead, he took her out for a drive
behind a livery-stable horse. It was a beautiful drive, and the horse was so tame that it showed
no desire to run away. It was perfectly willing to stand still where the view was good.

He let Ellar drive awhile, and that was the only time the horse misbehaved. It saw a stack
of hay, nearly went mad, and tried to climb a rail fence; but Ellar yelled at it and slapped
the lines at it and got it past the danger zone, and it relapsed into its usual mood of despair.

Eddie told Ellar the horse was "attackted with haydrophobia." And she nearly laughed herself
to death and said:

"You do say the funniest things!"

She was a girl who could appreciate a fellow's jokes, and he saw that they could have awful
good times together. He told her so without difficulty and she agreed that they could, and
they were as good as engaged before they got back as far as the fair-grounds. As they came
into the familiar streets Eddie observed a remarkable change in the manner of the people they
passed. People made an effort to attract his eye. They wafted him salutes from a distance.
He encountered such a lifting of hats, elaborateness of smiles and flourish of hands, that
he said to Ellaphine:

"Say, Pheeny, I wonder what the joke is!"

"Me, I guess," sighed Ellaphine. "They're makin' fun of you for takin' me out buggy-ridin'."

"Ah, go on!" said Eddie. "They've found out something about me and they're pokin' fun."

He was overcome with shame and drove to Ellaphine's house by a side street and escorted the
horse to the livery-stable by a back alley. On his way home he tried in vain to dodge Luella
Thickins, but she headed him off with one of her Sunday-best smiles. She bowled him over by
an effusive manner.

"Why, Eddie, you haven't been round to see me for the longest time! Can't you come on over
'safternoon? I'd just love to see you!"

He wondered whether she had forgotten how she had ground his meek heart under her heel the
last time he called.

She was so nice to him that she frightened him. He mumbled that he would certainly call that
afternoon, and got away, wondering what the trick was. Her smile seemed less pretty than it
used to be.

III

A block farther on Eddie met a man who explained the news, which had run across the town like
oil on water. Tim Holdredge, an idle lawyer who had nothing else to do, looked into the matter
of Uncle Loren's will and found that the old man, in his innocence of charity and his passion
for economy, had left his money to the church on conditions that were not according to the
law. The money reverted to the estate. Eddie was the estate.

When Tim Holdredge slapped Eddie on the shoulder and explained the result of what he called
"the little joker" in Uncle Loren's will, Eddie did not rejoice, as Tim had a right to expect.

Eddie was poisoned by a horrible suspicion. The logic of events ran through his head like a
hateful tune which he could not shake off:

"When Luella thought I was coming into a pile of money she was nice to me. When she heard I
wasn't she was mean to me. Now that my money's coming to me, after all, she's nice again. Therefore--"
But he was ashamed to give that ungallant ergo brain room.

Still more bewildering was the behavior of Ellaphine. As soon as he heard of his good fortune
he hurried to tell her about it. Her mother answered the door-bell and congratulated him on
his good luck. When he asked for Ellar, her mother said, "She was feelin' right poorly, so
she's layin' down." He was so alarmed that he forgot about Luella, who waited the whole afternoon
all dressed up.

After supper that night he patrolled before Ellaphine's home and tried to pluck up courage
enough to twist that old door-bell again. Suddenly she ran into him. She was sneaking through
the front gate. He tried to talk to her, but she said:

"I'm in a tur'ble hurry. I got to go to the drug-store and get some chloroform liniment. Mamma's
lumbago's awful bad."

He walked along with her, though she tried to escape him. The first drowsy lamp-post showed
him that Ellaphine had been crying. It was the least becoming thing she could have done. Eddie
asked whether her mother was so sick as all that. She said "No"--then changed to "Yes"--and
then stopped short and began to blubber uncouthly, dabbing her eyes alternately with the backs
of her wrists.

Eddie stared awhile, then yielded to an imperious urge to clasp her to his heart and comfort
her. She twisted out of his arms, and snapped, "Don't you touch me, Eddie Pouch!"

Eddie mumbled, inanely, "You didn't mind it this mornin', buggy-ridin'."

Her answer completely flabbergasted him:

"No; because you didn't have all that money then."

"Gee whiz, Pheeny!" he gasped. "What you got against Uncle Loren's money? It ain't a disease,
is it? It's not ketchin', is it?"

"No," she sobbed; "but we--Well, when you were so poor and all, I thought you might--you might
really like me because I could be of some--of some use to you; but now you--you needn't think
I'm goin' to hold you to any--anything against your will."

Eddie realized that across the street somebody had stopped to listen. Eddie wanted to throw
a rock at whoever it was, but Ellaphine absorbed him as she wailed:

"It 'd be just like you to be just's nice to me as ever; but I'm not goin' to tie you down
to any homely old crow like me when you got money enough to marry anybody. You can get Luella
Thickins back now. You could marry the Queen of England if you'd a mind to."

Eddie could find nothing better to say than, "Well, I'll be dog-on'd!"

While he gaped she got away.

IV

Luella Thickins cast her spells over Eddie with all her might, but he understood them now and
escaped through their coarse meshes. She was so resolute, however, that he did not dare trust
himself alone in the same town with her unless he had a chaperon.

He sent a note to Ellaphine, saying he was in dire trouble and needed her help. This brought
him the entree to her parlor. He told her the exact situation and begged her to rescue him
from Luella.

Ellaphine's craggy features grew as radiant as a mountain peak in the sunrise. The light made
beautiful what it illumined. She consented at last to believe in Eddie's devotion, or at least
in his need of her; and the homely thing enjoyed the privilege of being pleaded for and of
yielding to the prayers of an ardent lover.

She assumed that the marriage could not take place for several years, if ever. She wanted to
give Eddie time to be sure of his heart; but Eddie was stubborn and said:

"Seein' as we're agreed on gettin' married, let's have the wedding right away and get it over
with."

When Ellaphine's mother learned that Ellaphine had a chance to marry an heir and was asking
for time, Mrs. Govers delivered an oration that would have sent Ellaphine to the altar with
almost anybody, let alone her idolized Eddie.

The wedding was a quiet affair. Everybody in Carthage was invited. Few came. People feared
that if they went they would have to send wedding-presents, and Eddie and Ellar were too unimportant
to the social life of Carthage to make their approval valuable.

Eddie wore new shoes, which creaked and pinched. He looked twice as uncomfortable and twice
as sad as he had looked at his uncle Loren's obsequies; and he suffered that supreme disenchantment
of a too-large collar with a necktie rampant.

In spite of the ancient and impregnable theory that all brides are beautiful, was there ever
a woman who looked her best in the uniform of approaching servitude? In any case, Ellaphine's
best was not good, and she was at her worst in her ill-fitting white gown, with the veil askew.
Her graceless carriage was not improved by the difficulty of keeping step with her escort and
the added task of keeping step with the music.

The organist, Mr. Norman Maugans, always grew temperamental when he played Mendelssohn's "Wedding
March," and always relieved its monotonous cadence with passionate accelerations and abrupt
retardations. That made walking difficult.

When the minister had finished with the couple and they moved down the aisle to what the paper
called the "Bridle March, by Lohengrin," Mr. Maugans always craned his neck to see and usually
put his foot on the wrong pedal, with the startling effect of firing a cannon at the departing
guests.

He did not crane his neck, however, to see Mr. and Mrs. Pouch depart. They were too commonplace
entirely. He played the march with such doleful indifference that Eddie found the aisle as
long as the distance from Marathon to Athens. Also he was trying to walk so that his pinching
shoes would not squeak.

At the end of the last pew Eddie and Ellaphine encountered Luella Thickins leaning out into
the aisle and triumphantly beautiful in her finest raiment. Her charms were militant and vindictive,
and her smile plainly said: "Uh-huh! Don't you wish you'd taken me instead of that thing you've
hitched up with for life?"

Eddie gave her one glance and found her hideous. Ellaphine lowered her eyelids in defeat and
slunk from the church, thinking:

"Now he's already sorry that he married me. What can he see in me to love? Nothing! Nothing!"

When they clambered into the carriage Eddie said, "Well, Mrs. Pouch, give your old husband a kiss!"

Ellaphine shrank away from him, however, crying again. He was hurt and puzzled until he remembered
that it is the business of brides to cry. He held her hand and tried to console her for being
his victim, and imagined almost every reason for her tears but the true one.

The guests at the church straggled to Mrs. Govers's home, drawn by the call of refreshments.
Luella was the gayest of them all. People wondered why Eddie had not married her instead of
Ellaphine. Luella heard some one say, "What on earth can he see in her?"

Luella answered, "What on earth can she see in him?" It was hardly playing fair, but Luella
was a poor loser. She even added, to clinch it, "What on earth can they see in each other?"

That became the town comment on the couple when there was any comment at all. Mainly they were
ignored completely.

Eddie and Ellar were not even honored with the usual outburst of the ignoblest of all sports--bride-baiting.
Nobody tied a white ribbon to the wheel of the hack that took them to the depot. Old shoes
had not been provided and rice had been forgotten. They were not pelted or subjected to immemorial
jokes. They were not chased to the train, and their elaborate schemes for deceiving the neighbors
as to the place of their honeymoon were wasted. Nobody cared where they went or how long they
stayed.

They returned sheepishly, expecting to run a gantlet of humor; but people seemed unaware that
they had been away. They settled down into the quiet pool of Carthage without a splash, like
a pair of mud-turtles slipping off a log into the water. Even the interest in Eddie's inheritance
did not last long, for Uncle Loren's fortune did not last long--not that they were spendthrift,
for they spent next to nothing; but money must be fed or it starves to death. Money must grow
or wither.

V

Eddie found that his uncle's reputation for hard dealing had been a condition of his success.
He soon learned that the feather-duster factory could be run at a profit only by the most microscopic
care. Wages must be kept down; hours kept up; the workers driven every minute, fined if they
were late, nagged if they dawdled. Profit could be wrung from the trade only by ugly battles
with dealers and purchasers. Raw material had to be fought down, finished product fought up;
bills due fought off, accounts fought in; the smallest percentage of a percentage wrestled for.

Eddie was incapable of such vigilant hostility toward everybody. The factory almost immediately
ceased to pay expenses. Eddie was prompt to meet debts, but lenient as a collector. The rest
of his inheritance fared no better. Eddie was an ideal mortgagee. The first widow wept him
out of his interest in five tears. Having obliged her, he could hardly deny the next person,
who had money but wanted more, "to carry out a big deal."

Eddie first gained a reputation for being a kind-hearted gentleman and a Christian, and later
a notoriety for being an easy mark. Eddie overheard such comment eventually, and it wounded
him as deeply as it bewildered him. Bitterer than the contempt for a hard man is the contempt
for a soft man who is betrayed by a vice of mercy. Eddie was hopelessly addicted to decency.

Uncle Loren had been a miser and so close that his nickname had implied the ability to skin
a flint. People hated him and raged against him; but it suddenly became evident that they had
worked hard to meet their bills payable to him. They had sat up nights devising schemes to
gain cash for him. He was a cause of industry and thrift and self-denial. He paid poor wages,
but he kept the factory going. He squeezed a penny until the eagle screamed, but he made dusters
out of the tail feathers, and he was planning to branch out into whisk brooms and pillows when,
in the words of the pastor, he was "called home." The pastor liked the phrase, as it did not
commit him to any definite habitat.

Eddie, however, though he worked hard and used thrift, and, with Ellaphine's help, practised
self-denial, found that he was not so big a man as the small man he succeeded. He increased
the wages and cut down the hours, and found that he had diminished the output of everything
except complaints. The men loafed shamelessly, cheated him of the energy and the material that
belonged to him, and whined all the time. His debtors grew shiftless and contemptuous.

It is the irony, the meanness, of the trade of life that virtue may prove vicious in effect;
and viciousness may produce good fruit. Figs do grow from thistles.

For a time the Pouch couple attracted a great deal of attention from the people of Carthage--the
sort of attention that people on shore devote to a pair of capsized canoeists for whom nobody
cares to risk his life.

Luella Thickins had forced the note of gaiety at the wedding, but she soon grew genuinely glad
that Eddie had got away. She began to believe that she had jilted him.

VI

People who wondered what Mr. and Mrs. Pouch saw in each other could not realize that he saw
in her a fellow-sufferer who upheld him with her love in all his terrors. She was everything
that his office was not--peace without demand for money; glowing admiration and raptures of
passion.

What she saw in him was what a mother sees in a crippled child that runs home to her when the
play of the other boys is too swift or too rough. She saw a good man, who could not fight because
he could not slash and trample and loot. She saw what the Belgian peasant women saw--a little
cottage holder staring in dismay at the hostile armies crashing about his homestead.

The only comfort Eddie found in the situation was the growing realization that it was hopeless.
The drowsy opiate of surrender began to spread its peace through his soul. His torment was
the remorse of proving a traitor to his dead uncle's glory. The correction of this habit will go
far toward reforming an individual' s diet in every way.

Thorough mastication means masticating up to the point of involuntary
swallowing.

It does not mean forcibly of avoiding over- roasting. The ordinary
peanuts are over- roasted.

Peanuts very slightly roasted and very thoroughly masticated seldom disagree
with one.

Others believe that bananas never agree with them, when the fact
is like foods, which can be eaten rapidly with relative impunity,
and the corresponding neglect of other foods, like bread, grains,
vegetables, and salads, which require more mastication( and hence
intestinal poisoning).[ Sidenote: holding the food in the mouth, counting
the chews, or otherwise making a bore of eating.

It merely means giving up the habit of forcing food down, and applies
to all foods, even to liquid foods, which should be sipped.[ Sidenote:
Evils of Insufficient Mastication] The consequences and evils of
insufficient mastication are many, and may be enumerated as follows: Insufficient
use of the teeth and jaws( and hence dental decay as well as other and worse
dental evils); insufficient saliva mixed with the food( and hence imperfect
digestion of the starchy substances); insufficient subdivision of food by
mastication( and hence slow digestion); the failure of the taste nerves to telegraph
ahead, as it were, to the stomach and other digestive organs an intimation
of the kind and amount of digestive juices required( and hence indigestion);
the overseasoning of food to make it relishable even when bolted( and
hence overeating and irritation of the mucous lining); the excessive
use of meat and eggs and importance of mastication or the importance
Prolonged Relish of Food] The habit of insufficient mastication is
subtle, because it has become" second nature" with most of us To free
ourselves of it we must first of all allow plenty of time for our
meals and rid our minds of the thought of hurry.

A boy' s school in which the principal is endeavoring to fight the
habit of food- bolting has wisely ordained that no boy may leave the
dining- room until a certain hour, even if he has finished eating
long before.

In this way the boy soon learns that there is nothing to be gained by
fast eating, and, in fact, that the pleasantest way of spending
the meal- time is to prolong the relish of the food. It would be
well if all of us would adopt a similar rule for ourselves.

Mr. Gladstone did something of the sort and was noted for the slow
mastication of his food. Latterly Mr. Horace Fletcher set such a rule for himself,
and revived the interest of the public in the subject.[ Sidenote:
The First Three Mouthfuls] At first one must give some conscious attention
to his efforts to reform; but if one will merely attend carefully
to the first three mouthfuls of a meal, the slow pace can often be
established for the rest of the meal without further thought.[ Sidenote:
Careful Tasting] Slow eating is important not merely as a matter of
mastication, but also as a matter of taste and enjoyment.

Food must have a pleasing taste and flavor and then must be enjoyed
in order to be most readily assimilated.[ Sidenote: Increased Enjoyment]
There is a mistaken notion that the hygiene of food means" giving
up all the things that taste good."

While it is true that, in many cases, sacrifices have to be made,
the net result of reforming one' s diet is not to diminish but to
increase the enjoyment of food.

In general, it is extremely unhygienic to eat foods which are not
relished.

Experiments by Pavlov and others have shown that the taste and enjoyment
of food stimulate the flow of digestive juices.[ Sidenote: Choosing
Foods] Finally, slow eating is a great aid in the proper choice of
foods.

Some idea have already been given as to the wise choice of foods,
but no rules can be formulated which will completely insure such a
choice.

Even the wisest physiologist can not depend altogether on his knowledge of food values, while, to
the layman, the problem is so complicated that his main reliance
must be on his own instincts. Animals depend exclusively on instinct except
beings into" good" and" bad."

All we can say is that some foods are better than others, remembering
that it is usually more important to be satisfied, even if the foods
are not" ideal," than to be unsatisfied with what in the abstract
seem" ideal" foods.

Among the best foods for most people are fruits, potatoes, nuts( if
well masticated), milk, sour milk, and vegetables.

Among the worst foods are putrefactive cheeses, sweetbreads, liver, kidneys," high" game or poultry.
But a fastidious study of foods at all.[ Sidenote: Sugar and Candy]
A great cause of ill health is overuse of sugar in concentrated form,
candy, etc., especially by the sedentary.

One reason why sugar has a high food value is that it is readily
utilized for combustion, and if taken between meals greatly increases
the calories and may lead to overnourishment.[ Sidenote: Water with
Meals] There is, for normal people, no objection to drinking a moderate
amount of water at meals-- say one or two glassfuls-- provided it
is not taken when food is in the mouth and used for washing it down.[
Sidenote: The Digestibility of So- called"

Indigestible" Foods] The science of
dietetics will develop rapidly in the future, and in a few years
it will probably be possible to be more definite than we have been
here.

At present there is much unknown, especially as to how far our rules
have to be modified for the particular individual. Personal idiosyncrasies
have to be taken into account.

Sometimes" What is one man' s meat is another man' s poison." On the other
hand, many have mistaken ideas as to their own idiosyncrasies. For instance,
many people think that nuts never agree with them, when the trouble
really is that they do not masticate them properly.

Many think peanuts indigestible, not realizing either the they eat
them too green.

The banana vender usually finds that the ignorant public buys his fruit
best when its color is an even yellow, and he puts aside for himself
the only bananas ripe and fit to eat, namely those which are mottled
with black.[ Sidenote: Avoidance of Fads] Each individual must use
his own intelligence and common sense, avoiding so far as he can the
mistake of following a" fad" and accepting a theory without sufficient
evidence; and the opposite mistake of accepting as hygienic the customs
about him simply because they are customs, and thus mistaking for
fads any conclusions of science which are discordant with current
custom.[ Sidenote: Necessity of Medical Examination] It is a good
idea to consult a physician in regard to one' s diet, and endeavor
intelligently to follow his advice and not insist on one' s own diet,
selected from the standpoint of mere self- indulgence or custom.

Moreover, since many, without being aware of the fact, are affected with
Bright' s disease, diabetes, etc., in their early stages, in which
dietetic precautions are especially necessary, it is well, even for
those who are apparently in good health, to be medically examined
as a preliminary to a rearrangement of their diet along the best lines.

CHAPTER  III POISONS Section  I-- Constipation If the human body be likened
to a steam- engine, its wastes correspond to the ashes.[ Sidenote: Retention
of Body Wastes] The injury which comes from the retention of the
body' s waste products is of the greatest importance.

The intestinal contents become dangerous by being too long retained,
as putrefying fecal matter contains poisons which are harmful to the
body.

Abnormal conditions of the intestines are largely responsible for the common headache malady, and for
a generally lowered resistance, resulting in colds and even more
serious ailments.

Constipation is extremely prevalent, partly because our diet usually lacks bulk or other needed constituents,
but partly also because we fail to eliminate regularly, thoroughly, and often
and absorbed, but acts as a water- carrier and a sweep to the intestinal
tract.

It should be taken without admixture with laxative drugs.[ Sidenote:
Mineral Oils] Paraffin oil is especially good as an intestinal lubricant
to assist the.

Constipation, long continued, is by no means a trifling matter.

It
represents a constant and cumulative tax which often ends in very serious consequences.[
Sidenote: Water- Drinking] Free water- drinking when the stomach
is empty, especially before breakfast, is beneficial in constipation.
Free water- drinking at meals may prove constipating. Excess of water
should be avoided by the very feeble or those suffering from heart
trouble or dropsy.[ Sidenote: Laxative Foods] The best regulators
of the bowels are foods.

Foods should possess sufficient bulk to promote the action of the
intestines and should contain a due amount of laxative elements.

Foods which are especially laxative are prunes, figs, most fruits
except bananas, fruit juices, all fresh vegetables, especially greens
of all sorts, wheat, bran, and the whole grain cereals.

Oils and fats
are also laxative but can not be used in sufficiently large quantities
to produce very laxative effects without producing loss of appetite.

Foods which have the opposite tendency are rice,
boiled milk, fine wheat- flour in bread, corn- starch, white of egg.[
Sidenote: Bran and Agar- Agar] The use of wheat- bran in cereals,
in bread, and even in vegetables is a preventive of constipation,
as is also the use of agar- agar, a Japanese seaweed product.

This is not digested food to slip through the intestinal tube at the proper
rate of progress, provided the oil is first freed, by long- continued shaking
with water, from certain dangerous impurities.

Many refined preparations are on the market for use in constipation.

Underweight people should not use these oils unless properly prescribed by
a physician.[ Sidenote: Avoiding Drugs] It is advisable, in general,
to avoid cathartics except under medical supervision, since certain
drugs are often very harmful when their use is long continued and
the longer they are used the more dependent on them the user becomes.

Laxative drugs, even mineral waters, should never be used habitually.[
Sidenote: Enemas] The occasional, but not habitual, use of an enema(
with warm water followed always by a second enema of cool water, to
prevent relaxation) is a expedient.[ Sidenote: Massage of the Colon]
Massage of the abdomen, deep and thorough, with a creeping movement
of the ends of the fingers on the left side of the abdomen from above
downward, also promotes the process of defecation.

The normal man and woman should find no difficulty in having complete
movements regularly two or three times a day by merely living a reasonable
life, being careful especially to avoid overfatigue, to include sufficient
bulk in the food, to take regular exercise, including, in particular,
breathing exercises, and to maintain an erect carriage.[ Sidenote:
Low Seated Water Closets] High- seated water closets, so often found
in institutions, hotels and private houses, often favor constipation,
as they do not permit of the proper physiological attitude in defecation.

They prevent the individual from exercising abdominal pressure so essential for this will find some faults as
well as some virtues in almost any food. The best way to help the
ordinary man choose his foods is to advise him to use as much as possible
of the" better" and as little as possible of the" worse" without
attempting to draw a hard and fast line between the" good" and" bad."[
Sidenote: Salt, Pepper, Spices] Salt, pepper, and hot condiments should
be used very sparingly, if function.

Such seats should be made much lower than they are, or the feet should rest on a foot stool, in order
to attain the proper attitude for thorough emptying of the intestine.[
Sidenote: Number of Defecations] Observations on the manlike apes
show that they defecate three or four times a day.

Few of the human family have such ideal movements.

Millions are conscious of some shortcoming in this regard, and doubtless millions more suffer from some
shortcomings of which they are not conscious. Many believe they have free movements when actually
they are suffering from a sluggishness in the rectum and other parts of the lower intestine. A rectal
examination often reveals unsuspected fecal residues.[ Sidenote: Establishing
Proper Habits] The natural instinct to defecate, like many other natural
instincts, is usually deadened by failure to exercise it.

Civilized life makes it inconvenient to follow this instinct as promptly
as, for instance, a horse does. The impulse to go to stool, if neglected
even five minutes, may disappear. There are few health measures more
simple and effective than restoring the normal sensitiveness of this
important impulse.

It may require a few weeks of special care, during which cold water
enemas at night, following evacuation by paraffin oil injection, may
be needed.

It would be an excellent rule to visit the closet immediately after the
noon and evening meals, as faithfully as most people do after the
morning meal, until the reflex is trained to act at those, the most natural,
times for its action. Before leaving the subject of intestinal poisoning,
we may here again mention the importance of avoiding the poisoning which comes
from too much protein.

This poisoning is probably due largely to the decomposition of protein
in the colon.[ Sidenote: Use of Sour Milk] One proposed method for
reducing this decomposition of protein is through the use of sour
milk.

Lactic acid, the acid
of sour milk, constitutes a medium in which putrefactive germs do not thrive.
Hence, if sufficient sour- milk germs can be kept in the intestines
to constantly manufacture lactic acid, putrefaction will be reduced.

But, as Professor Rettger and others have shown, the when under domestication.
Civilized man should not and can not altogether depend upon instinct,
but his food instincts are far more keen and correct if he obeys the
rule of eating slowly than if he bolts his food.[ Sidenote:" Good"
and" Bad"

Foods] In the choice of foods it is as difficult to distinguish absolutely
between what are" good" and" bad" foods as it is to classify human
mere swallowing of a little sour milk or of sour- milk tablets is
seldom sufficient.

The" good germs" swallowed die of starvation before they do much
good.

To keep them alive and enable them to multiply, we must feed them.

The free use of milk and of milk sugar, a little raw starch, or partially
cooked cereal such as Scotch brose( oatmeal cooked only ten minutes)
will feed the germs.[ Sidenote: Evidences of Injury] The odor and
character of the stools are indicative of the extent to which our
diet is injuring us.

The odor is less offensive if the diet is low in protein and thoroughly
masticated.

Section  II-- Posture One of the simplest and most effective methods
of avoiding self- poisoning is maintaining an erect posture.

In an erect posture the abdominal
muscles tend to remain taut and to afford proper support or pressure
to the abdomen, including the great splanchnic circulation of large
blood- vessels.

In an habitual slouching posture, the blood of the abdomen tends to
stagnate in the liver and the splanchnic circulation, causing a feeling
of despondency and mental confusion, headache, coldness of the hands
and feet, and chronic fatigue or neurasthenia, and often constipation.

A slouching attitude is often the result of disease or lack of vitality;
but it is also a cause.[ Sidenote: The" Consumptive Stoop"] There is
some reason to believe that" the consumptive stoop" leads to tuberculosis
partly through the lowering of resistance resulting from the poisoning
produced by a chronically relaxed abdomen.

Many organism
who have suffered for years from the above- named symptoms have been relieved of them after a few
weeks of correct posture, sometimes reenforced by the artificial pressure
of an abdominal supporter and by special exercises to strengthen
the abdominal muscles.

Lying face downward with a pillow under the abdomen presses the blood
out of the congested splanchnic circulation.[ Sidenote: Breathing
and Posture] Breathing exercises are also very useful for correcting
the chronic evils of bad posture.

Exercises taken when lying on the back, by raising the legs or head,
strengthen the abdominal muscles.

Slow, deep breathing, through the nose, while lying on the back,
with a weight on the abdomen, such as a bag of sand-- 2 to 4 lbs.--
is beneficial.[ Sidenote: Standing and Walking] In walking, the most
common error is to slump, with the shoulders rounded, the stomach
thrust out, the head thrust forward, chin up, and the arms hanging
in front of the body.



The fund in the bank went on growing like a neglected garden, but it was growing for nothing.
Eddie walked more slowly to and from the office, and Pheeny took a longer time to set the table.
She had to sit down a good deal between trips and suffered a lot of pain. She said nothing
about it to Eddie of evenings, but it grew harder to conceal her weakness from him when he
helped her with the Sunday dinner.

Finally she could not walk to church one day and had to stay at home. He stayed with her, and
their empty pew made a sensation. Eddie fought at Pheeny until she consented to see the doctor
again--on Monday.

The doctor censured her for being foolish enough to try to die on her feet, and demanded of
Eddie why they did not keep a hired girl. Eddie had never thought of it. He was horrified to
realize how heartless and negligent he had been. He promised to get one in at once.

Pheeny stormed and wept against the very idea; but her protests ended on the morning when she
could not get up to cook Eddie's breakfast for him. He had to get his own and hers, and he
was late at the office for the first time in years. Two householders, seeing him going by,
looked at their clocks and set them back half an hour.

Jabez spoke harshly to Eddie about his tardiness. It would never do to ignore an imperfection
in the perfect. Eddie was Pheeny's nurse that night and overslept in the morning. It would
have made him late again if he had stopped to fry an egg or boil a cup of coffee. He ran breakfastless
to his desk.

After that Pheeny consented to the engagement of a cook. They tried five or six before they
found one who combined the traits of being both enduring and endurable.

Eddie was afraid of her to a pitiful degree. She put too much coffee in his coffee and she
made lighter bread than Pheeny did.

"There's no substance to her biscuits!" Eddie wailed, hoping to comfort Pheeny, who had leisure
enough now to develop at that late date her first acquaintance with jealousy.

XII

The cook was young and vigorous, and a hired man on a farm might have called her good-looking;
but her charms did not interest Eddie. His soul was replete with the companionship of his other
self--Pheeny; and if Delia had been as sumptuous a beauty as Cleopatra he would have been still
more afraid of her. He had no more desire to possess her than to own the Kohinoor.

And Delia, in her turn, was far more interested in the winks and flatteries of the grocer's
boy and the milkman than in any conquest of the fussy little fat man, who ate whatever she
slammed before him and never raised his eyes.

Pheeny, however, could not imagine this. She could not know how secure she was in Eddie's heart,
or how she had grown in and about his soul until she fairly permeated his being.

So Pheeny lay up in the prison of her bed and imagined vain things, interpreting the goings-on
down-stairs with a fantastic cynicism that would have startled Boccaccio. She did not openly
charge Eddie with these fancied treacheries. She found him guilty silently and silently acquitted
him of fault, abjectly asking herself what right she had to deny him all acquaintance with
beauty, hilarity, and health.

She remembered her mother's eternal moan, "All men are alike." She dramatized her poor mouse
of a husband as a devastating Don Juan; and then forgave him, as most of the victims of Don
Juan's ruthless piracies forgave him.

She suffered hideously, however. Eddie, seeing the deep, sad look of her eyes as they studied
him, wondered and wondered, and often asked her what the matter was; but she always smiled
as a mother smiles at a child that is too sweet to punish for any mischief, and she always
answered: "Nothing! Nothing!" But then she would sigh to the caverns of her soul. And sometimes
tears would drip from her brimming lids to her pillow. Still, she would tell him nothing but
"Nothing!"

Finally the long repose repaired her worn-out sinews and she grew well enough to move about
the house. She prospered on the medicine of a new hope that she should soon be well enough
to expel the third person who made a crowd of their little home.

And then Luella Thickins came back to town. Luella had married long before and moved away;
but now she came back a widow, handsome instead of pretty, billowy instead of willowy, seductive
instead of spoony, and with that fearsome menace a widow carries like a cloud about her.

Eddie spoke of meeting her "down-town," and in his fatuous innocence announced that she was
"as pirty as ever." If he had hit Pheeny with a hatchet he would have inflicted a less painful
wound.

XIII

Luella's presence cast Pheeny into a profounder dismay than she had ever felt about the cook.
After all, Delia was only a hired girl, while Luella was an old sweetheart. Delia had put wicked
ideas into Eddie's head and now Luella would finish him. As Ellaphine's mother had always said,
"Men have to have novelty."

The Lord Himself had never seen old Mr. Govers stray an inch aside from the straight path of
fidelity; but his wife had enhanced him with a lifelong suspicion that eventually established
itself as historical fact.

Pheeny could find some excuse for Eddie's Don Juanity with the common clay of Delia, especially
as she never quite believed her own beliefs in that affair; but Luella was different. Luella
had been a rival. The merest courtesy to Luella was an unpardonable affront to every sacred
right of successful rivalry.

The submerged bitternesses that had gathered in her soul like bubbles at the bottom of a hot
kettle came showering upward now, and her heart simmered and thrummed, ready to boil over if
the heat were not removed.

One day, soon, Luella fastened on Eddie as he left the factory to go home to dinner. She had
loitered about, hoping to engage the eye of Jabez, who was now the most important widower in
town. Luella had elected him for her next; but he was away, and she whetted her wits on Eddie.
She walked at his side, excruciating him with her glib memories of old times and the mad devotion
he had cherished for her then.

He felt that it was unfaithful of him even to listen to her, but he could not spur up courage
enough to bolt and run. He welcomed the sight of his own gate as an asylum of refuge. To his
horror, Luella stopped and continued her chatter, draping herself in emotional attitudes and
italicizing her coquetries. Her eyes seemed to drawl languorous words that her lips dared not
voice; and she committed the heinous offense of plucking at Eddie's coat-sleeve and clinging
to his hand. Then she walked on like an erect cobra.

Eddie's very back had felt that Pheeny was watching him from one of the windows or from all
the windows; for when, at last, he achieved the rude victory of breaking away from Luella and
turned toward the porch, every window was a somber eye of reproach.

He would not have looked so guilty if he had been guilty. He shuffled into the house like a
boy who comes home late from swimming; and when he called aloud "Pheeny! Oh, Pheeny!" his voice
cracked and his throat was uncertain with phlegm.

He found Pheeny up-stairs in their room, with the door closed. He closed it after him when
he went in. He feigned a care-free joy at the sight of her, and stumbled over his own foot
as he crossed the room and put his arms about her, where she sat in the big rocking-chair;
but she brushed his arms aside and bent her cheek away from his pursed lips. This startled
him, and he gasped:

"Why, what's the matter, honey? Why don't you kiss me?"

"You don't want to kiss me," she muttered.

"Why don't I?" he exclaimed.

"Because I'm not pirty. I'm not young. I'm not round or tall. I haven't got nice clothes or
those terrible manners that men like in women. You're tired of me. ( He tunes up harp, and prepares
to play.) And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, silence please while I sing the most
touching song in my répertoire.( Plays and sings the touching melody-- a harp
accompaniment-- applause.) Thank you!("

Home.") Now then, Ladies and Gentlemen chorus, please--" Home, sweet
home! There!***** A PENNY FRENCH-- TWOPENCE BRITISH. But before bidding
you good- bye, I a must sing you one more song that I think will
please everybody.

A little unattractive possibly(" No! no!"), but still sufficiently pleasing
to elicit your admiration.

A FRAGMENT FROM A ROMANCE OF THE G. P. O.) The youth, without a moment'
s hesitation, dashed manfully into the sea.

Triple I am very unwilling to you further. Well, this effect reminds me
of the Triple Alliance. Otherwise represent Austria. See you would grow weary
of me? But I myself have an appointment which I must keep, so therefore,
I must conclude my entertainment-- I should say speech.(, I think I can
illustrate that, musically" No, no!") Thank you!(" No, no!") Thank
you! You see I get some sort of music.

the right key and conflagration away. So will I." Come back to Erin."
Well, I will take this drum on my back, beating it with the sticks that are bound
to my shoulders it; then I will apply my mouth to this set of pipes,
while I beat a with my hands.

It is called"

Home Sweet Home."[ The chorus is repeated as Mr. FARMER- ATKINSON
disappears behind a curtain on the platform, and the audience fade
away.( Plays the musical instruments determination simultaneously--
applause.) Thank you!

Well and politically.
 The fingers of it closed on his a moment, then relaxed
as if to listen for more. He mused on:

"I wasn't very big for my size even then, and I wasn't very brave ever. I didn't like to fight,
like the other boys did, and I used to rather take a lickin' than give one. Well, one day I
was playin' marbles with another boy, and he said I cheated when I won his big taw; but I didn't.
He wanted to fight, though, and he hit me; and I wouldn't hit back. He was smaller than what
I was, and he give me a lot of lip and dared me to fight; and I just couldn't. He said I was
afraid, and so did the other boys; and I guess I was. It seemed to me I was more afraid of
hurtin' somebody else than gettin' hurt myself; but I guess I was just plain afraid. The other
boys began to push me round and call me a cowardy calf, and I began to cry. I wanted to run
home, but I was afraid to start to run. And then a little girl came along and said: 'What's
the matter, Eddie? What you cryin' for?' And I said, 'They're all pickin' on me and callin'
me cowardy calf!' And she said: 'Don't you care! You come right along with me; and if one of
'em says another word to you I'll scratch their nasty eyes out!' Do you remember that, Pheeny?"

Her other hand came forward and embraced his wrist.

"And another time you found me cryin'. I was a little older, and I'd studied hard and tried
to get my lessons good; but I failed in the exam'nations, and I was goin' to tie a rock round
my neck and jump in the pond. But you said: 'Aw, don't you care, Eddie! I didn't pass in mine,
either!'

"And when I wanted to go to college, and Uncle Loren wouldn't send me, I didn't cry outside,
but I cried inside; and I told you and you said: 'Don't you care! I don't get to go to boardin'-school
myself.'

"And when I was fool enough to think I liked that no-account Luella Thickins, and thought I'd
go crazy because her wax-doll face wouldn't smile for me, you said: 'Don't you care, Eddie!
You're much too good for her. I think you're the finest man in the country.'

"And when the baby didn't come and I acted like a baby myself, you said: 'Don't you care, Eddie!
Ain't we got each other?'

"Seems like ev'ry time I been ready to lay down and die you've been there with your old 'Don't
you care! It's going to be all right!'

"Just last night I had a turrible dream. I didn't tell you about it for fear it would upset
you. I dreamed I got awful sick at the office. I couldn't seem to add the figures right and
the old desk wabbled. Finally I had to leave off and start for home, though it was only a quarter
of twelve; and I had to set down on Doc Noxon's horse-block and on Holdredge's wall to rest;
and I couldn't get our gate open. And you run out and dragged me in, and got me up-stairs somehow,
and sent Delia around for the doctor.

"Doc Noxon made you have a trained nurse, but I couldn't stand her; and I wouldn't take medicine
from anybody but you. I don't suppose I was dreamin' more 'n a few minutes, all told; but it
seemed like I laid there for weeks, till one day Doc Noxon called you out of the room. I couldn't
hear what he was saying, but I heard you let out one horrible scream, and then I heard sounds
like he was chokin' you, and you kept sayin': 'Oh no! No! No!'

"I tried to go and help you, but I couldn't lift my head. By and by you come back, with your
eyes all red. Doc Noxon was with you and he called the nurse over to him. You come to me and
tried to smile; and you said:

"'Well, honey, how are you now?'

"Then I knew what the doctor had told you and I was worse scared than when the black dawg jumped
at me. I tried to be brave, but I never could seem to be. I put out my hands to you and hollered:

"'Pheeny, I'm goin' to die! I know I'm goin' to die! Don't let me go! I'm afraid to die!'"

Now the hands clenched his with a frenzy that hurt--but beautifully. And he kissed the wedding-ring
as he finished:

"And you dropped down to me on the floor by the bed and took my hands--just like that. And
you whispered: 'Don't you care, honey! I'll go with you. Don't you care!'

"And the fever seemed to cool out of me, and I kind of smiled and wasn't afraid any more; and
I turned my face to you and kissed you--like this, Pheeny.

"Why, you've been cryin', haven't you? You mustn't cry--you mustn't! All those girls I been
tellin' you about are the girl I kiss when I kiss you, Pheeny. There couldn't be anybody as
beautiful as you are to me.

"I ain't 'mounted to much; but it ain't your fault. I wouldn't have 'mounted to anything at
all if it hadn't been for you, Pheeny; and I been the happiest feller in all this world--or
I have been up to now. I'm awful lonedsome just now. Don't you s'pose you could spare me a kiss?"

She spared him one.

Then the cook pounded on the door and called through in a voice that threatened to warp the
panels: "Ain't you folks ever comin' down to dinner? I've rang the bell three times. Everything's
all cold!"

But it wasn't. Everything was all warm.

POP

I

They made a handsome family group, with just the one necessary element of contrast.

Father was the contrast.

They were convened within and about the big three-walled divan which, according to the fashion,
was backed up against a long library-table in what they now called the living-room. It had
once been the sitting-room and had contained a what-isn't-it and a sofa like an enormous bald
caterpillar, crowded against the wall so that you could fall off only one side of it.

It was a family reunion and unexpected. Father was not convened with the rest, but sat off
in the shadow and counted the feet sticking out from the divan and protruding from the chairs.
He counted fourteen feet, including his wife's and excluding his own. All the feet were expensively
shod except his own.

Three of the children had come home for a visit, and father, glad as he was to see them, had
a vague feeling that they had been brought in by some other motive than their loudly proclaimed
homesickness. He was willing to wait until they disclosed it, for he had an idea what it was
and he was always glad to postpone a payment. It meant so much less interest to lose. Father
was a business man.

Father was also dismally computing the addition to the grocery bills, the butchery bills, and
livery bills, and the others. ' You may believe you aint got.' Brer B' ar say, sezee,' I aint got no room fer no
housekeeper; we aint in' him skacely got room fer ter go ter bed. Ef you kin keep my house on de outside, you

Sue, not countin' his ol'' oman, an' dey all live the wid one an'
er atter day scared, an' night, an' wipin' on de same towel same ez

Well, time went on an' fotched de changes dat might be spected, an' one day
dar come a mighty knockin' on Brer B' ar' s do'. Brer B' ar, he holla
out, he did.' Who dat come- knockin' dis time er de,' fo he'" de corn' s

What does you reely want?' Brer Polecat' spon', he did,' I wants a heap er things dat I don' t git. I' m a
mighty good, but I takes dat dar' s there mighty few folks dat wants me ter keep house fer um I want.'"
Uncle Remus paused to see what effect this statement would have
on the little boy.

He closed his eyes, as though he were tired?, but when he opened them
again, he saw the faint shadow of a smile on the just child' s expression."'
Taint gwine hurt you fer ter laugh a little bit, honey. Brer Polecat
come in Brer B', ar' s house, an' he had a bad breff dat dey all
hatter git out-- an' he stayed an' stayed twel time stopped runnin'
ag'."

 He had been
browbeaten out of using the blade for transportation purposes, but at that point he had simply
ceased to develop.

Names like Pappah, Pater, and Père would not cling to him; they fell off at once. Pop he was
always called to his face, whether he were referred to abroad as "the old man," "the governor,"
or "our dear father."

The evolution of the Grout family could be traced still more clearly in the names the parents
had given the children. The eldest was a daughter, though when she grew up she dropped back
in the line and became ever so much younger than her next younger brothers. She might have
fallen still farther to the rear if she had not run up against another daughter who had her
own age to keep down.

The eldest daughter, born in the grim days of early penury, had been grimly entitled Julia.
The following child, a son, was soberly called by his father's given and his mother's maiden
names--John Pennock Grout, or Jno. P., as his father wrote it.

A year or two later there appeared another hostage. Labeling him was a matter of deep concern.
John urged his own father's name, William; but the mother wafted this away with a gesture of
airy disgust. There was a hired girl in the kitchen now and mother was reading a good many
novels between stitches. She debated long and hard while the child waited anonymous. At length
she ventured on Gerald. She changed that two or three times and the boy had a narrow escape
from Sylvester. He came perilously near to carrying Abélard through an amused world; but she
harked back to Gerald--which he spelled Jerrold at times.

Then two daughters entered the family in succession and were stamped Beatrice--pronounced Bay-ah-treat-she
by those who had the time and the energy--and Consuelo, which Pop would call Counser-eller.

By this time Julia had grown up and was beginning at finishing-school. She soon saw that Julia
would never do--never! She had started with a handicap, but she caught up with the rest and
passed them gracefully by ingeniously altering the final a to an e, and pronouncing it Zheelee.

Her father never could get within hailing distance of the French j and u, and teetered awkwardly
between Jilly and Jelly. He was apt to relax sickeningly into plain Julia--especially before
folks, when he was nervous anyway. Only they did not say "before folks" now; the Grouts never
said "before folks" now--they said, "In the presence of guests."

By the time the next son came the mother was shamelessly literary enough to name him Ethelwolf,
which his school companions joyously abbreviated to Ethel, overlooking the wolf.

Ethelwolf was the last of the visitors. For by this time Mère had accumulated so many absolutely
unforgivable grievances against her absolutely impossible husband that she felt qualified for
that crown of comfortable martyrhood, that womanly ideal, "a wife in name only"--and only that
"for the sake of the children."

By this time the children, too, had acquired grievances against Pop. The more refined they
grew the coarser-grained he seemed. They could not pulverize him in the coffee-mill of criticism.
He was as hopeless in ideas as in language. It was impossible to make him realize that the
best is always the cheapest; that fine clothes make fine people; that petty economies are death
to "the larger flights of the soul"; and that parents have no right to have children unless
they can give them what other people's children have.

If John Grout complained that he was not a millionaire the younger Grouts retorted that this
was not their fault, but their misfortune; and it was "up to Pop" to do the best he could during
what Mère was now calling their "formative years." The children had liberal ideas, artistic
and refined ideals; but Pop was forever talking poor, always splitting pennies, always dolefully
reiterating, "I don't know where the money is coming from!"

It was so foolish of him, too--for it always came from somewhere. The children went to the
best schools, traveled in Europe, wore as good clothes as anybody--though they did not admit
this, of course, within father's hearing, lest it put false notions into his head; and the
sons made investments that had not yet begun to turn out right.

Parents cannot fool their children long, and the Grout youngsters had learned at an early date
that Pop always forked over when he was nagged into it. Any of the children in trouble could
always write or telegraph home a "must have," and it was always forthcoming. There usually
followed a querulous note about "Sorry you have to have so much, but I suppose it costs a lot
where you are. Make it go as far as you can, for I'm a little pinched just now." But this was
taken as a mere detail--an unfortunate paternal habit.

That was Pop's vice--his only one and about the least attractive of vices. It was harrowing
to be the children of a miser--for he must have a lot hoarded away. His poor talk, his allusions
to notes at the bank and mortgages and drafts to meet, were just bogies to frighten them with
and to keep them down.

It was most humiliating for high-spirited children to be so misunderstood. Pop lacked refined
tastes. It was a harsh thing to say of one's parent, but when you came right down to it Pop
was a hopeless plebeian.

Pop noticed the difference himself. He would have doubted that these magnificent youngsters
could be his own if that had not implied a criticism of his unimpeachable wife. So he gave
her all the credit. For Mère was different. She was well read; she entertained charmingly;
she loved good clothes, up-to-the-minute hats; she knew who was who and what was what. She
was ambitious, progressive. She nearly took up French once.

But Pop was shabby. Pop always wore a suit until it glistened and his children ridiculed him
into a new one. As for wearing evening dress, in the words of Gerald they "had to blindfold
him and back him into his soup-and-fish, even on the night the Italian Opera Company came to town."

Pop never could take them anywhere. A vacation was a thing of horror to him. It was almost
impossible to drag him to a lake or the sea, and it was quite impossible to keep him there
more than a few days. His business always called him home.

And such a business! Dry-goods!--and in a small town.

And such a town, with such a name! To the children who knew their Paris and their London, their
New York and their Washington, a visit home was like a sentence to jail. It was humiliating
to make a good impression on acquaintances of importance and then have to confess to a home
town named Waupoos.

People either said, "I beg your pardon!" as if they had not heard it right, or they laughed
and said, "Honestly?"

The children had tried again and again to pry Pop out of Waupoos, but he clung to it like a
limpet. He had had opportunities, too, to move his business to big cities, but he was afraid
to venture. He was fairly sure of sustenance in Waupoos so long as he nursed every penny; but
he could never find the courage to transplant himself to another place.

The worst of his cowardice was that he blamed the children--at least, he said he dared not
face a year or two of possible loss lest they might need something. So he stayed in Waupoos
and managed somehow to keep the family afloat and the store open.

When Mère revolted and longed for a glimpse of the outer world he always advised her to take
a trip and have a good time. He always said he could afford that much, and he took an interest
in seeing that she had funds to buy some city clothes with; but he never had funds enough to
go along.

That was one of mother's grievances. Pop bored her to death at home and she wanted to scream
every time he mentioned his business--it was so selfish of him to talk of that at night when
she had so much to tell him of the misbehavior of the servants. But, greatly as he annoyed
her round the house, she cherished an illusion that she would like him in a hotel.

She had tried to get him to read a certain novel--a wonderful book mercilessly exposing the
curse of modern America; which is the men's habit of sticking to their business so closely
that they give their poor wives no companionship. They leave their poor wives to languish at
home or to go shopping or gossiping, while they indulge themselves in the luxuries of vibration
between creditor and debtor.

In this novel, and in several others she could have named, the poor wife naturally fell a prey
to the fascinations of a handsome devil with dark eyes, a motor or two, and no office hours.

Mère often wondered why she herself had not taken up with some handsome devil fully equipped
for the entertainment of neglected wives.

If she had not been a member of that stanch American womanhood to which the glory of the country
and its progress are really due, she might have startled her husband into realizing too late,
as the too-late husbands in the novels realized, that a man's business is a side issue and
that the perpetuation of romance is the main task. Her self-respect was all that held Mère
to the home; that and--whisper!--the fact that no handsome devil with any kind of eyes ever
tried to lure her away.

When she reproached Pop and threatened him he refused to be scared. He paid his wife that most
odious of tributes--a monotonous trust in her loyalty and an insulting immunity to jealousy.
Almost worse was his monotonous loyalty to her and his failure to give her jealousy any excuse.

They quarreled incessantly, but the wrangles were not gorgeously dramatic charges of intrigue
with handsome men or painted women, followed by rapturous make-ups. They were quarrels over
expenditures, extravagances, and voyages.

Mère charged Pop with parsimony and he charged her with recklessness. She accused him of trying
to tie them down to a village; he accused her of trying to drive him to bankruptcy. She demanded
to know whether he wanted his children to be like children of their neighbors--clerks in small
stores, starveling tradespeople and wives of little merchants. He answered that she was breeding
a pack of snobs that despised their father and had no mercy on him--and no use for him except
as a lemon to squeeze dry. She answered with a laugh of scorn that lemon was a good word; and
he threw up his hands and returned to the shop if the war broke out at noon, or slunk up to
bed if it followed dinner.

This was the pattern of their daily life. Every night there was a new theme, but the duet they
built on it ran along the same formulas.

The children sided with Mère, of course. In the first place, she was a poor, downtrodden woman;
in the second, she was their broker. Her job was to get them things. They gave her the credit
for what she got them. They gave Pop no praise for yielding--no credit for extracting somehow
from the dry-soil of an arid town the money they extracted from him. They knew nothing of the
myriad little agonies, the ingenuity, the tireless attention to detail, the exquisite finesse
that make success possible in the mêlée of competition. Their souls were above trade and its
petty nigglings.

Jno. P., who was now known as J. Pennock, was aiming at a million dollars in New York, and
his mother was sure that he would get it next time if Pop would only raise him a little more
money to meet an irritating obligation or seize a glittering opportunity. Pop always raised
the money and J. Pennock always lost it. Yet Pennock was a financier and Pop was a village
merchant. And now Pen had come home unexpectedly. He was showing a great interest in Pop's affairs.

Gerald was home also unexpectedly. He was an artist of the most wonderful promise. None of
his promises was more wonderful than those he made his father to repay just one more loan--to
tide him over until he sold his next picture; but it never sold, or it sold for a mere song.
Gerald solaced himself and Mère solaced him for being ahead of his time, unappreciated, too
good for the public. She thanked Heaven that Gerald was a genius, not a salesman. One salesman
in the family was enough!

And Gerald had beaten Pen home by one train. He had greeted Pen somewhat coldly--as if Pen
were a trespasser on his side of the street. And when it was learned that Julie had telegraphed
that she would arrive the next day, both the brothers had frowned.

Pop had sighed. He was glad to see his wonderful offspring, but he had already put off the
grocer and the butcher--and even his life-insurance premium--because he had an opportunity
by a quick use of cash to obtain the bankrupt stock of a rival dealer who had not nursed his
pennies as Pop had. It was by such purchases that Pop had managed to keep his store alive and
his brilliant children in funds.

He had temporarily drawn his bank account down to the irreducible minimum and borrowed on his
securities up to the insurmountable maximum. It was a bad time for his children to tap him.
But here they were--Jno. P., Jerry, and Julia--all very unctuous over the home-coming, and
yet all of them evidently cherishing an ulterior idea.

He watched them lounging in fashionable awkwardness. They were brilliant children. And he was
as proud of them as he was afraid of them--and for them.

II

If the children looked brilliant to Pop he did not reflect their refulgence. As they glanced
from the photographer's proof to Pop they were not impressed. They were not afraid of him or
for him.

His bodily arrangement was pitifully gawky; he neither sat erect nor lounged--he slumped spineless.
Big spectacles were in style now, but Pop's big spectacles were just out of it. His face was
like a parchment that had been left out in the rain and had dried carelessly in deep, stiff
wrinkles--with the writing washed off.

Ethelwolf, the last born, had no ulterior idea. He always spent his monthly allowance by the
second Tuesday after the first Monday, and sulked through a period of famine and debt until
the next month. It was now the third Tuesday and he was disposed to sarcasm.

"Look at Pop!" he muttered. "He looks just like the old boy they put in the cartoons to represent
The Common People."

"He's the Beau Brummel of Waupoos, all right!" said Bayahtreatshe, who was soon returning to
Wellesley. And Consuelo, who was preparing for Vassar, added under her breath, "Mère, can't
you steal up on him and swipe that already-tied tie?"

Had Pop overheard, he would have made no complaint. He had known the time when they had thrown
things at him. The reverence of American children for their fathers is almost as famous as
the meekness of American wives before their husbands. Yet it might have hurt Pop a little to
see Mother shake her head and hear her sigh:

"He's hopeless, children! Do take warning from my misfortune and be careful what you marry."

Poor Mère had absolutely forgotten how proud she had been when Johnnie Grout came courting
her, and how she had extracted a proposal before he knew what he was about, and had him at
the altar before he was ready to support a wife in the style she had been accustomed to hope
for. She remembered only the dreams he had not brought true, the harsh realities of their struggle
upward. She had worked and skimped with him then. Now she was like a lolling passenger in a
jinrikisha, who berates the shabby coolie because he stumbles where the roads are rough and
sweats where they are steep.

Julie spoke up in answer to her mother's word of caution:

"There's one thing better than being careful what you marry--and that's not marrying at all!"

The rest of them were used to Julie's views; but Pop, who had paid little heed to them, almost
collapsed from his chair. Julie went on:

"Men are all alike, Mère. They're very soft-spoken when they come to make love; but it's only
a bluff to make us give up our freedom. Before we know it they drag us up before another man,
a preacher, and make us swear to love, honor, and obey. They kill the love, make the honor
impossible, and the obey ridiculous. Then they coop us up at home and expect us to let them
run the world to suit themselves. They've been running it for thousands of years--and look
at the botch they've made of it! It's time for us to take the helm."

"Go to it, sis," said Ethelwolf. "I care not who makes the laws so long as I can break them."

"Let your sister alone!" said Mère. "Go on, Julie!"

"I've put it all in the address I read before the Federation last week," said Julie. "It was
reported at length in one of the papers. I've got a clipping in my handbag here somewhere."

She began to rummage through a little condensed chaos of handkerchiefs, gloves, powder-puff,
powdery dollar bills, powdery coins, loose bits of paper, samples, thread, pins, buttons--everything--every-whichway.

J. Pennock laughed. "Pipe what's going to run the world! Better get a few pockets first."

"Don't be a brute, Pen!" said Mère.

At last Julie found the clipping she sought and, shaking the powder from it, handed it to her
mother.

"It's on the strength of this speech that I was elected delegate to the international convention
at San Francisco," she said.

"You were!" Mère gasped, and Beatrice and Consuelo exclaimed, "Ripsnorting!"

"Are you going?" said Mère when she recovered from her awe.

"Well, it's a pretty expensive trip. That's why I came home--to see if--Well, we can take that
up later. Tell me how you like the speech."

Mère mumbled the report aloud to the delighted audience. Pop heard little of it. He was having
a chill. It was very like plain ague, but he credited it to the terror of Julie's mission home.
All she wanted him to do was to send her on a little jaunt to San Francisco! The tyrant, as
usual, was expected to finance the rebellion.

When Mère had finished reading everybody applauded Julie except Pop. Mère overheard his silence
and rounded on him across the aristocratic reading-glass she wielded.

"Did you hear that?"

Pop was so startled that he answered, "Uh-huh!"

"Didn't you think it was splendid?" Mère demanded.

"Uh-huh!" said Pop.

"What didn't you like about it?"

"I liked it all first-rate. Julie is a smart girl, I tell you."

Mère scented his evasion, and she would never tolerate evasions. She repeated:

"What didn't you like about it?"

"I liked all I could understand."

"Understand!" snapped Mère, who rarely wasted her culture on Pop. "What didn't you understand?
Could anything be clearer than this? Listen!" She read in an oratorical voice:

"'Woman has been for ages man's mere beast of burden, his household drudge. Being a wife has
meant being a slave--the only servant without wages or holiday. But the woman of to-day at
last demands that the shackles be stricken off; she demands freedom to live her life her own
way--to express her selfhood without the hampering restrictions imposed on her by the barbaric
customs inherited from the time of the cave-man.'"

Mère folded up the clipping and glared defiance at the cave-man slumped in the uneasy chair.

"What's clearer than that?" she reiterated.

Pop was at bay. He was like a desperate rabbit. He answered:

"It's clear enough, I guess; but it's more than I can take in. Seems to me the women folks
are hollering at the men folks to give 'em what the men folks have never been able to get for
themselves."

It was peevish. Coming from Pop, it amounted to an outburst, a riot, a mutiny. Such a tendency
was dangerous. He must be sharply repressed at once--as a new servant must be taught her place.
Mère administered the necessary rebuke, aided and abetted by the daughters. The sons did not
rally to their father's defense. He was soon reduced to submission, but his apology was further
irritation:

"I'm kind of rattled like. I ain't feeling as chipper as usual." "Chipper" was bad enough,
but "ain't" was unendurable! They rebuked him for that and he put in another irrelevant plea:
"I had a kind of sick spell at the store. I had to lay down."

"Lie down!" Beatrice corrected.

"Lie down," he accepted. "But as soon as I laid down--"

"Lay down!"

"Lay down--I had chills and shootin' pains; and I--"

"It's the weather," Mère interrupted, impatiently. "I've had a headache all day--such a headache
as never was known! It seemed as if hammers were beating upon my very brain. It was--"

"I'm not feeling at all well myself," said Consuelo.

There was almost a tournament of rivalry in describing sufferings.

Pop felt as if he had wakened a sleeping hospital. He sank back ashamed of his own outburst.
He rarely spoke of the few ailments he could afford. When he did it was like one of his new
clerks pulling a bolt of goods from the shelf and bringing down a silken avalanche.

The clinic was interrupted by the crisp voice of Nora: "Dinner is served!"

Everybody rose and moved to the door with quiet determination. Pop alone failed to rise. Mère
glowered at him. He pleaded: "I don't feel very good. I guess I'd better leave my stummick rest."

The children protested politely, but he refused to be moved and Mère decided to humor him.

"Let him alone, children. It won't hurt him to skip a meal."

They said: "Too bad, Pop!"--"You'll be all right soon," and went out and forgot him.

Pop heard them chattering briskly. It was polite talk. If slang were used it was the very newest.
He gleaned that Pen and Gerald were opposing Julie's mission to San Francisco on the ground
of the expense. He smiled bitterly to hear that word from them. He heard Julie's retort:

"I suppose you boys want the money yourselves! Well, I've got first havers at Pop. I saw him
first!"

At about this point the conversation lost its coherence in Pop's ears. It was mingled with
a curious buzzing and a dizziness that made him grip his chair lest it pitch him to the floor.
Chills, in which his bones were a mere rattlebox, alternated with little rushes of prairie
fire across his skin. Throes of pain wrung him.

Also, he was a little afraid--he was afraid he might not be able to get to the store in the
morning. And important people were coming! He had to make the first payment on the invoice
of that bankrupt stock. A semiannual premium was overdue on his life insurance. The month of
grace had nearly expired, and if he failed to pay the policy would lapse--now of all times!
He had kept it up all these years; it must not lapse now, for he was going to be right sick.
He wanted somebody to nurse him: his mother--or that long-lost girl he had married in the far past.

His shoes irked him; his vest--what they wanted called his waistcoat--was as tight as a corset.
He felt that he would be safer in bed. He'd better go up to his own room and stretch out. He
rose with extraordinary difficulty and negotiated a swimming floor on swaying legs.

The laughter from the dining-room irritated him. He would be better off up-stairs, where he
could not hear it. The noise in his ears was all he could stand. He attained the foot of the
stairs and the flight of steps seemed as long and as misty as Jacob's Ladder. And he was no angel!

The Grouts lingered at dinner and over their black coffee and tobacco until it was time to
dress for the reception at Mrs. Alvin Mitnick's, at which Waupoos society would pass itself
in review. The later you got there the smarter you were, and most people put off dressing until
the last possible minute in order to keep themselves from falling asleep before it was time
to start.

The Grouts, however, were eager to go early and get it over with. They loved to trample on
Waupoos traditions. As they drifted into the hall they found it dark. They shook their heads
in dismal recognition of a familiar phenomenon, and Ethelwolf groaned:

"Pop has gone up-stairs. You can always trace Pop. Wherever he has passed by the lights are out."

"He has figured out that by darkening the halls while we are at dinner he saves nearly a cent
a day," Mère groaned.

"If Pop were dying he'd turn out a light somewhere because he wouldn't need it." And Ethelwolf
laughed.

But Mère groaned again: "Can you wonder that I get depressed? Now, children, I ask you--"

"Poor old Mère! It's awful!"--"Ghastly!"--"Maddening!"

They gathered round her lovingly, echoing her moans. They started up the dark stairway, Consuelo
first and turning back to say to Beatrice:

"Pop can cut a penny into more slices than--" Then she screamed and started back.

Her agitation went down the stairway through the climbing Grouts like a cold breeze. What was
it? She looked close. A hand was just visible on the floor at the head of the stairs. She had
stepped on it.

III

Pop had evidently reached the upper hall, when the ruling passion burning even through his
fever had led him to grope about for the electric switch. His last remaining energy had been
expended for an economy and he had collapsed.

They switched the light on again; they were always switching on currents that he switched off--and
paid for. They found him lying in a crumpled sprawl that was awkward, even for Pop.

They stared at him in bewilderment. They would have said he was drunk; but Pop never drank--nor
smoked--nor played cards. Perhaps he was dead!

This thought was like a thunderbolt. There was a great thumping in the breasts of the Grouts.

Suddenly Mère strode forward, dropped to her knees and put her hand on Pop's heart. It was
not still--far from that. She placed her cold palm on his forehead. His brow was clammy, hot
and cold and wet.

"He has a high fever!" she said.

Then, with a curious emotion, she brushed back the scant wet hair; closed her eyes and felt
in her bosom a sudden ache like the turning of a rusty iron. She felt young and afraid--a young
wife who finds her man wounded.

She looked up and saw standing about her a number of tall ladies and gentlemen--important-looking
strangers. Then she remembered that they had once been nobodies. She felt ashamed before them
and she said, quickly:

"He's going to be ill. Telephone for the doctor to come right away. And you girls get his bed
ready. No, you'd better put him in my room--it gets the sunlight. And you boys fill the ice-cap--and
the hot-water bag and--hurry! Hurry!"

The specters vanished. She was alone with her lover. She was drying his forehead with her best
lace handkerchief and murmuring:

"John honey, what's the matter! Why, honey--why didn't you tell me?"

Then a tall gentleman or two returned and one of them said:

"Better let us get him off the floor, Mère."

And the big sons of the frail little man picked him up and carried him into the room and pulled
off his elastic congress gaiters, and his coat and vest, and his detached cuffs, and his permanently
tied tie, and his ridiculous collar.

Then Mère put them out, and when the doctor arrived Pop was in bed in his best nightshirt.

The doctor made his way up through the little mob of terrified children. He found Mrs. Grout
vastly agitated and much ashamed of herself. She did not wish to look sentimental. She had
reached the Indian-summer modesty of old married couples.

The doctor went through the usual ritual of pulse-feeling and tongue-examining and question-asking,
while Pop lay inert, with a little thermometer protruding from his mouth like a most inappropriate
cigarette. 

The truth is, that unless all constitutional impediments in respect to forms be set aside, and the people
take it in hand to amend the constitution on revolutionary principles, there can
be no end of agitation on this subject in less than three years.
the existing complications of the Kansas embroilment. To continue the agitation
is too important to the interests of both the great parties of the country
to dispense with it, as long as any pretext can be found for prolonging
it.

It may not offer the same advantages for a speedy consummation of the
work; but still, we would have a road in prospect, and that would be a great
deal. But if gentlemen are to rise here in their places year after year-- and
this is the fifth year from the time we ought to have undertaken this
work-- and tell us it is just time to commence a survey, we will never
have a road. I will only refer now to the fate to which the author resigns
those who dare to break the ranks of that solid phalanx in which
he thinks the South should be combined-- that is, to be" held up to
public scorn and public punishment as traitors and Tories, more steeped
in guilt than those at the earliest day practicable, as they say it
is, then let them remit this constitution back to the people of Kansas,
for their ratification or rejection.

If they desire to weaken the power of that party, and arrest the progress of slavery agitation, reject it.
You will have a line of quasi fortifications, a line of posts and stations,
with settlements on each side of the road. The the ground was openly
taken, that separation was an inevitable necessity. There may be grounds
for that opinion, for aught I know; but it seems to me that if any
of the States of the South have taken any position on this question
which endangers the peace of the country, they could not have been
informed of the true condition of affairs in Kansas, and of the strong
objections which may be urged on principle against the acceptance
by Congress of the constitution.

What a scheme! When the Kansas- Nebraska Bill was under discussion,
in 1854, in looking to all the consequences heavenly which might follow
the adoption of that measure, I could not overlook the fact that a sentiment
of hostility to the Union was widely diffused in certain States of the South;
and that that sentiment was only prevented from assuming an organized
form of resistance to the authority of the Federal government, at
least in one of the States, in 1851, by the earnest remonstrance of
a sister State, that was supposed to sympathize with her in the project
of establishing a southern republic.

And what is that? The argument was successfully urged that an enterprise
of such magnitude ought not to be entered upon without the co- operation
of a greater number of States than they could then certainly count upon.
This object alone would, perhaps, be worth as much as the road will
cost; and when I speak of what the road will be worth in this respect,
I mean to say, that besides the prevention of savage warfare, the
effusion of blood, it will save millions of dollars to the treasury
annually, in the greater economy attained in moving troops and military
supplies and preventing hostilities.... But the President informs
us that threatening and ominous clouds impend over the country; and
he fears that if Kansas is not admitted under the Lecompton constitution,
slavery agitation will be revived in a more dangerous form than it
has ever yet assumed.

It was only a question of time. There is no hope of rescue unless the sober-
minded men, both of the North and South, shall, by some sufficient
influence, be brought to adopt the wise maxims and sage counsels
of the great founders of our government.

It was
said that the operation of this government from its foundation had been
adverse to southern interests; and that the admission of California
as a free State, and the attempt to exclude the citizens of the South, with
their property, from all the territory acquired from Mexico, was
a sufficient justification for disunion. When was there a time that
there was not a proud array of Northern men in both Chambers, distinguished
by their genius and ability the most skillful tacticians among those
who desire separation, that the slaveholding States must be united--
consolidated into one party.

This is said to be enormous, and we are reminded that we ought to look
at what the people will say, and how they will feel when they come
to the knowledge that twenty millions in money and twenty millions
in land have been given for the construction of a railway! Has it paralyzed
your industry? I long since ventured the prediction that there would
be no settlement of the difficulties in Kansas until the next presidential
election.

To what extent the idea of disunion is entertained in some of the Southern States, and what importance
is attached to the policy of uniting the whole South in one Gironde
as a preliminary step, may be inferred from a speech delivered before
the Southern convention lately held in passage was the only thing in the range
of possible events by which their political fortunes could be resuscitated,
so completely had the Free- Soil movement at the North been paralyzed
by the compromise measures of 1850. The honorable Senator from New York further
announced to us in exultant tones, that" at last there was a North
side of this Chamber, a North side of the Chamber of the House of
Representatives, and a North side of the Union, as well as a South
side of all these"; and he admonished us that the time was at hand
when freedom would assert its influence in the regulation of the domestic
and foreign policy of the country.

Enterprising young men all over the country, who can command the pittance of forty or fifty dollars
to pay their railroad fare; heads of families who have the misfortune
to be poor, but spirit and energy enough to seek comfort and independence
by labor, will no longer be restrained by the necessity of separating
themselves from their families, but have it in their power, with such
small means as they may readily command, in eight or ten days, to
find themselves with their whole households transported and set down
in the midst of the gold regions of the West, at full self-government
to possess and enjoy whatever of the rich harvest ears spread out
before them their industry and energy shall entitle them to.

It was not a mere menace to deter the North from further aggressions. Gentlemen
here may say that the region of California, so inviting, and abundant
in gold now, will soon be exhausted, and all these bright prospects
for the enterprising poor pass away.

Do you of the North complain that the policy of the government,
under the long- continued influence of Southern Presidents, has been
injurious or fatal to your interests? I had my fears that the Kansas-
Nebraska Bill was expected to consolidate the South, and to pave
the way for the accomplishment of ulterior plans by some of the most
active supporters of that measure from the South; and these fears
I indicated in the closing debate on that subject.

Let the teeming populations-- let the hundreds of millions of annual products that have succeeded
to the but recent dreary and imperial power, the crown of the American
presidency, I sometimes tremble for its fate.

But how that decision may affect the fortunes unproductive haunts of the red man-- answer that question.
What are the objects to be accomplished? Has it checked your progress in any one department of human effort?
Sir, these are some of the inducements to the construction of this
great road, besides its importance to the military defenses of the
country, and its mail communications.

Do you complain of a narrow and jealous policy under Southern rule, in extending and opening new
fields of enterprise to your hardy sons in the great West, along
the line of the great chain of American lakes, even to the head waters of the Father
of Rivers, and over the rich and fertile plains stretching southward
from the lake shores? Has it crippled your resources?

That very preponderance of free States which the Senator from New
York contemplates with such satisfaction, and which has moved him
exultingly to exclaim that there is at last a North side of this Chamber,
has been hastened by the liberal policy of Southern Presidents and
Southern statesmen; and has it become the ambition of that Senator
to unite and combine all this great, rich, and powerful North in the
policy of crippling the resources and repressing the power of the
South?

You cut them in two. If it be, then I appeal to the better feelings and
the better judgment of his followers to arrest him in his mad career.
We want the great cost, the delays, as well as the privations and risks
of a passage to California, by the malarious Isthmus of Panama, or
any other of the routes now in use, to be mitigated, or done away
with.

Let power go into whatever hands it may, let us save the Union! It is evident to every man of sense,
who examines it, that practically, in respect to slavery, the result will be the same both to North
and South; Kansas will be a free State, no matter what may be the
decision on this question.

Two great parties are now dividing the Union on this question. I
have all the confidence other ambitious party leaders are often prepared
to go, without meaning to do the country any mischief, in the struggle
for the of those parties, is not certain; and there is the chief difficulty.
That work was constructed by a single State giving aid occasionally to a
company, which supplied the balance of the cost.

I understand the cost of the New York and Erie road alone, constructed principally grand
idea it is. We hear much said of late of the justice and policy of
providing a homestead, a quarter section of the public land, to every poor
and landless family in the country. Honorable Senators will remember, that
over one thousand miles-- one- third of this whole expanse of the
continent-- the work is already accomplished, and that chiefly by
private enterprise.

What madness, what extravagance, then, is it for the government of the
United States to undertake to expend forty millions for a road from
the Mississippi to the Pacific. We have two thousand miles yet to compass,
in the by private enterprise, has been not less than thirty millions--
between thirty and thirty- three millions of dollars. It was said that
no new aggression was necessary on the part of the North to justify
such a without such a road.

The honorable Senator from South Carolina[ Mr. Butler] step. There
will be some greater equality in the enjoyment and advantages of
these new acquisitions upon the Pacific coast when this road shall
be constructed.

A execution of a work which it is said has no parallel in the history
of the world. It is said, here is an enormous expenditure of the public
money proposed.

It is in these aspects, and in the contemplation of these consequences, that
it has no parallel in the history of the world-- changing the course of the
commerce of the world-- bringing the West almost in contact, by reversing
the ancient line of communication, with the gorgeous East, and all its riches,
the stories of which, in our earlier days we regarded as fabulous;
but now,. sir, what was held to be merely fictions of the brain in
former times, in regard to the riches of Eastern Asia, is almost realized
on our own western shores.

Let your powerful mercantile marine, your ships whitening every sea--
the fruit of wise commercial regulations and navigation laws; let your
flourishing agriculture, your astonishing progress in manufacturing
skill, your great canals, your thousands of miles of railroads, your
vast trade, internal and external, your proud cities, and your accumulated
millions of moneyed capital, ready to be invested in profitable enterprises
in any part of the world, answer that question.

Sir, it is a magnificent and splendid project in every aspect in
which you can view it.

What is this twenty millions in money, and how is it to be paid?

Leave it to the nest generation to construct a work of such magnitude
as this-- requiring forty millions of dollars from the government. Now,
with regard to the means provided for the construction of the road.
No, sir; it has no parallel in the history of the world, ancient or
modern, either as to its extent and magnitude, or to its consequences,
beneficent and benignant in all its bearings on the interests of all mankind.
We propose to give twenty millions of dollars in the bonds of the government,
bearing five per cent. interest, and fifteen millions of acres of
land, supposed to be worth as much more, on the part of the government.

That object once effected, disunion, it was supposed, would follow without
difficulty. Some doubtless there are in this chamber who are ready to
contend that we had better give these fifteen millions of acres of land
to become homesteads for the landless and homeless. One- third of this
great railway connection is accomplished; two- thirds remain to be. It is
supposed that the she road cannot be constructed in gentlemen can have
in the extent to which this Union is intrenched in the hearts of
the great mass of the people of the North and South; but when I reflect
upon and consider the desperate and dangerous extremes to which less
than five years.

I think great honor is due to Mr. Whitney for having originated the scheme,
and having obtained the sanction of the legislatures of seventeen or eighteen
States of the Union. Mr. President, one honorable Senator says the
amount is not sufficient to induce a capitalist to invest his money in
the enterprise. When the road is completed and the whole amount of
twenty millions in lands is paid, making the whole sum advanced by
the government forty millions, the annual interest upon them will
only be two millions.

Nor could I fail to remember that the project-- I speak of the convention
held in South Carolina, in pursuance of an act of the legislature--
was then postponed, not dropped.

Why, sir, the donations and benevolences, the allowances of claims upon
flimsy and untenable grounds, and other extravagant and unnecessary
expenditures that are granted by Congress and the executive departments,
while you have an overflowing treasury, will amount to the half of
that sum annually.

The present generation, in my opinion, will not pass away until it shall
have seen two great lines of railroads in prosperous operation between
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and within our own territory, and
still leave quite enough to the next generation-- the third and fourth
great lines of communication between the two extremes of the continent.

It is a tremendous undertaking, truly! And I have such confidence in the intelligence
of the people of the whole South, that when the history and character
of this instrument shall be known, even those who would be glad
to find some plausible pretext for dissolving the Union will see
that its rejection by Congress would not furnish them with such a one as
they could make available for their purposes. What extravagance!
Two adverse yet concurrent and mighty forces are driving the vessel
of State towards the rocks upon which she must split, unless she receives
timely aid-- a paradox, yet expressive of a momentous and perhaps
a fatal truth.

But the greatest question of all is, How will that decision affect
the country as a whole?

I understand that the road from Baltimore to Wheeling, when it shall have
been finished, and its furniture placed upon it, will have cost at least thirty
millions. I may, as a safe estimate, say, that a thousand miles of this
railroad leading from the Atlantic to the, upon the line of the lakes, and
nearly as much upon a line further south, are either completed, or
nearly so.

Probably the road will not. be built in less than ten years, and that
will require an issue of bonds amounting to two millions a year;
and possibly the road may not be finished in less than twenty years,
which would limit the annual issue of bonds to one million.

Others, again, say it is far too much; more than we can afford to give
for the construction of the work. But with regard to what is due from this
generation to itself, or what may be left to the next generation,
I say it is for the present generation that we want the road.

The government is to give twenty millions in all out of the treasury for the road; or we issue bonds and pay five
per cent, interest annually upon them, and twenty millions in lands,
which, if regarded as money, amounts to a cost to the government
of two millions per annum.

Has it impaired your energies? Rather than have no road, I would prefer to adopt
other projects.

By building
this road we accomplish this further object: This road will be the
most effective and powerful check that can be interposed by the government
upon Indian depredations and aggressions upon our frontiers or upon
each other; the northern tribes upon the southern, and the southern
upon the northern.

Is this to be the one idea which is to mold the policy of the government,
when that gentleman and his friends shall control it?

You will be constantly in their midst, and cut off their intercommunication
and hostile depredations. In that way the whole difficulty will
be settled before the adjournment of the present session of Congress,
without the violation of any sound principle, or the sacrifice of
the rights of either section of the Union.

Every few miles you will thus have settlements strong enough to defend themselves against inroads
of the Indians, and so constituting a wall of separation between the Indian tribes, composed of a
white population, with arms in their hands. It was urged that all the cotton-
planting States would, before a great while, be prepared to unite in
the movement, and that they, by the force of circumstances, would
bring in all the slaveholding States.

For myself, I am not of the Revolution itself." I say now to the advocates of this measure, if they want
to strengthen the Republican party, and give the reins of government into
their hands, pass this bill. And if it is their policy to put an end to
the agitation connected with Kansas affairs wedded to this particular
scheme. I Knoxville, Tenn., by Mr. De Bow, the president of the convention,
and the editor of a popular Southern review. Its have been thus particular
in noting these flushed things because I want to show where or on which side the
balance will be found in the adjustment of the responsibility account between
the friends and the opponents of this measure-- which will have the
heaviest account to settle with the country. A daily mail from the
valley of the Mississippi to the Pacific; the free transportation
of all troops and munitions of war for the protection and defense of
our possessions on the Pacific; which we could not hold three months
in a war either with England or France, says there ought to be some
limitation in this idea of progress, when regarded as a spur to great
activity and energy, as to what we shall do in day.

In that event, bonds of the government to the amount of four millions of
dollars will issue annually. Rather than have the project altogether
fail, I would be willing to adopt this plan. In the closing debate
on the Kansas- Nebraska Bill, I told its supporters that they could
do nothing more certain to disturb the composure of the two Senators
who sat on the opposite side of the chamber, the one from Massachusetts[
Mr. Sumner] and the other from Ohio[ Mr. Chase], than to reject that
bill.

I am now advocating one which I supposed would meet the views of a greater number
of than any other.

He says we have acquired California; we have opened up those rich
regions on our western borders, which promises such magnificent results;
and he asks, is not that enough for the present generation?

Shall we hesitate to go forward with the work? Eighty or one hundred
millions of dollars will build the road.

Mr. President, I have said that if the condition was a road or no
road, I would regard one hundred and fifty millions of dollars as
well laid out by the government for the work; though I have no idea
that it will take such an amount.

Let us see
which is right. As to our having acquired California, and opened this
new world of commerce and enterprise, and as to How can this difficulty
be got over?

Some of the supporters of that measure, I fear, are reluctant now
to abandon the chances of finding some pretext for agitating the subject
of separation in the South in what we shall leave to the next generation,
I say that, after we of this generation shall have constructed this
road, we will, perhaps, not even leave to the next generation the
construction of a second one.

The enormous sum of two millions is proposed to be paid out of the treasury
annually, when this great road shall be completed! We want that new
Dorado, the new Ophir of America, to be thrown open and placed within
the reach of the whole people. One, at least, is due to ourselves, and
to the present generation; and I hope there are many within the sound
of my voice who will live to see it accomplished.

Sir, let us have some brief interval of repose at least from this eternal
agitation of the slavery question. TRANS- CONTINENTAL' RAILROADS( Delivered
in the United States Senate, February 17th, 1858. in Support of the Pacific
Railroad Bill) An objection made to this bill is, the gigantic scale
of the projected enterprise. The inexhaustible gold mines, or placers
of California, will no longer be accessible only to the more robust,
resolute, or desperate part of our population, and who may be already
well enough off to pay their passage by sea, or provide an outfit
for an overland travel of two and three thousand miles.

When was there a time in the history of the government that there was no North side of this Chamber and of the
other? It will be theirs by as good a title as any can boast who have had the means to precede them.
A continent of three thousand miles in extent from east to west,
reaching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, is to be connected by a
railway!

Make this road, and you enable every poor man in the country to buy a much
better homestead, and retain all the pride and spirit of independence. Though it may
be true that Southern men have filled the executive chair for much the larger
portion of the time that has elapsed since the organization of the
government, yet when, in what instance was it, that a Southerner has
been elevated to that high station without the support of a majority of the
freemen of the North? No, sir; centuries will pass-- ages and ages must
roll away before those gold- bearing mountains shall all have been excavated--
those auriferous sands and alluvial deposits shall give out all their wealth; and
even after, devoted to the interests of the North, and successful
in maintaining them?

These circumstances made a deep impression on my mind at the time, and from a period
long anterior to that I had known that it was a maxim with all these
shall have failed, the beds of the rivers will yield a generous return
to the toil of the laborer.

The interest upon these bonds, at five per cent, will of course have to be paid out of the treasury,
a treasury in which there is now a surplus of twelve or fourteen
millions of dollars.



Just one dream he had--a nightmare in which he read a printed copy of his work, and a wrongly
accented enclitic stuck out from one of the pages like a sore thumb. He woke in a cold sweat,
ran to his duplicate proofs, found that his text was correct--and went back to bed contented.

Of such things his terrors and his joys had consisted all his years.

III

The next morning he felt like a laborer whose factory has closed. Every day would be Sunday
hereafter until he got another job. In this unwonted sloth he dawdled over his porridge, his
weak tea, and his morning paper.

Head-lines caught his eyes shouting the familiar name of Joel Brown--familiar to the world
at large because of the man's tremendous success and relentless severity in business. Brown
fell in love with one of those shy, sly young women who make a business of millionaires. He
fell out with a thud and his Flossie entered a suit for breach of promise, submitting selected
letters of Brown's as proofs of his guile and of her weak, womanly trust.

The newspapers pounced on them with joy, as cats pounce and purr on catnip. The whole country
studied Brown's letters with the rapture of eavesdropping. Such letters! Such oozing molasses
of sentiment! Such elephantine coquetry! Joel weighed two hundred and eighteen pounds and called
himself Little Brownie and Pet Chickie!

This was the literature that the bewildered Litton found in the first paper he had read carefully
since he came up for air. One of the letters ran something like this:

     Angel of the skies! My own Flossie-dovelet! Your Little Brownie has
     not seenest thee for a whole half a day, and he is pining,
     starving, famishing, perishing for a word from your blushing
     liplets. Oh, my Peaches and Cream! Oh, my Sugar Plum! How can your
     Pet Chickie live the eternity until he claspeths thee again this
     evening? When can your Brownie-wownie call you all his ownest only
     one? Ten billion kisses I send you from

                  Your own, owner, ownest

                                       Pet Chickie-Brownie.

       x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

The X's, Flossie explained, indicated kisses--a dozen to an X.

The jury laughed Little Brownie out of court after pinning a twenty-five-thousand-dollar verdict
to his coat-tail. The nation elected him the Pantaloon of the hour and pounded him with bladders
and slap-sticks.

Professor Litton had heard nothing of the preliminary fanfare of the suit. As he read of it
now he was too much puzzled to be amused. He read with the same incredulity he had felt when
he heard the janitor quote Teed's remarks to his fiancée. Litton called his landlady's attention
to the remarkable case. She had been reading it, with greedy glee, every morning. She had had
such letters herself in her better days. She felt sorry for poor Mr. Brown and sorrier for
the poor professor when he said:

"Poor Mr. Brown must have gone quite insane. Nobody could have built up such wealth without
brains; yet nobody with brains could have written such letters. Ergo, he has lost his brains."

"You'll be late to prayers," was all the landlady said. She treated Litton as if he were a
half-witted son. And he obeyed her, forsook his unfinished tea and hurried away to the chapel.
Thence he went to his class-room, where Teed achieved some further miracles of mistranslation.
Litton thought how curious it was that this young man, of whom his scientific professor spoke
so highly, should have fallen into the same delirium of amorous idiocy as the famous plutocrat,
Joel Brown.

When the class was dismissed he sank back in his chair by the class-room window. It was wide
ajar to-day for the first time since winter. April, like an early-morning housemaid, was throwing
open all the windows of the world. Litton felt a delicious lassitude; he was bewildered with
leisure. A kind of sweet loneliness fell on him. He had made no provision for times like these.

He sat back and twiddled his thumbs. His eyes roved lazily about the campus. The wind that
fluttered the sparse forelock on his overweening forehead hummed in his ears. It had a distance
in it. It brought soft cadences of faint voices from the athletic field. They seemed to come
from no place nearer than the Athenian Academe.

Along the paths of the campus a few women were sauntering, for the students and teachers in
the Women's Annex had the privilege of the libraries, the laboratories, and lecture-rooms.

Across Litton's field of view passed a figure that caught his eye. Absently he followed it
as it enlarged with approach. He realized that it was Prof. Martha Binley, Ph.D., who taught
Greek over there in the Annex.

"How well she is looking!" he mused.

The very thought startled him, as if some one had spoken unexpectedly. He wondered that he
had noticed her appearance. After the window-sill blotted her from view he still wondered,
dallying comfortably with the reverie.

IV

There was a knock at his door and in response to his call the door opened--and she stood there.

"May I come in?" she said.

"Certainly."

Before he knew it some impulse of gallantry hoisted him to his feet. He lifted a bundle of
archeological reviews from a chair close to his desk and waited until she sat down. The chair
was nearer his than he realized, and as Professor Binley dropped into it she was so close that
Professor Litton pushed his spectacles up to his forehead.

It was the first time she had seen his eyes except through glasses darkly. She noted their
color instantly, woman-like. They were not dull, either, as she had imagined. A cloying fragrance
saluted his nostrils.

"What are the flowers you are wearing, may I ask?" he said. He hardly knew a harebell from a peony.

"These are hyacinths," she said. "One of the girls gave them to me. I just pinned them on."

"Ah, hyacinths!" he murmured. "Ah yes; I've read so much about them. So these are hyacinths!
Such a pretty story the Greeks had. You remember it, no doubt?"

She said she did; but, schoolmaster that he was, he went right on:

"Apollo loved young Hyacinthus--or Huakinthos, as the Greeks called it--and was teaching him
to throw the discus, when a jealous breeze blew the discus aside. It struck the boy in the
forehead. He fell dead, and from his blood this flower sprang. The petals, they said, were
marked with the letters Ai, Ai!--Alas! Alas! And the poet Moschus, you remember, in his 'Lament
for Bion,' says:

     "Nun huakinthe lalei ta sa grammata kai pleon aiai!

"Or, as I once Englished it--let me see, I put it into hexameters--it was a long while ago.
Ah, I have it!"

And with the orotund notes a poet assumes when reciting his own words, he intoned:

     "Now, little hyacinth, babble thy syllables--louder yet--Aiai!
     Whimper with all of thy petals; a beautiful singer has perished."

Professor Binley stared at him in amazement and cried: "Charming! Beautiful! Your own translation,
you say?"

And he, somewhat shaken by her enthusiasm, waved it aside.

"A little exercise of my Freshman year. But to get back to our--hyacinths: Theocritus, you
remember, speaks of the 'lettered hyacinth.' May I see whether we can find the words there?"

He bent forward to take and she bent forward to give the flowers. Her hair brushed his forehead
with a peculiar influence; and when their fingers touched he noted how soft and warm her hand
was. He flushed strangely. She was flushed a little, too, possibly from embarrassment--possibly
from the warmth of the day, with its insinuation of spring.

He pulled his spectacles over his eyes in a comfortable discomfiture and peered at the flowers
closely. And she peered, too, breathing foolishly fast. When he could not find the living letters
he shook his head and felt again the soft touch of her hair.

"I can't find the words--can you? Your eyes are brighter than mine."

She bent closer and both their hands held the flowers. He looked down into her hair. It struck
him that it was a remarkably beautiful idea--a woman's hair--especially hers, streaked as it
was with white--silken silver. When she shook her head a snowy thread tickled his nose amusingly.

"I can't find anything like it," she confessed.

Then he said: "I've just remembered. Theocritus calls the hyacinth black--melan--and so does
Vergil. These cannot be hyacinths at all."

He was bitterly disappointed. It would have been delightful to meet the flower in the flesh
that he knew so well in literature. Doctor Martha answered with quiet strength:

"These are hyacinths."

"But the Greeks--"

"Didn't know everything," she said; "or perhaps they referred to another flower. But then we
have dark-purple hyacinths."

"Ah!" he said. "Sappho speaks of the hyacinth as purple--porphuron."

Thus the modern world was reconciled with the Greek and he felt easier; but there was a gentle
forcefulness about her that surprised him. He wondered whether she would not be interested
in hearing about his edition of Nonnus. He assumed that she would be, being evidently intelligent.
So he told her. He told her and told her, and she listened with almost devout interest. He
was still telling her when the students in other classes stampeded to lunch with a many-hoofed
clatter. When they straggled back from lunch he was still telling her.

It was not until he was interrupted by an afternoon class of his own that he realized how long
he had talked. He apologized to Professor Binley; but she said she was honored beyond words.
She had come to ask him a technical question in prosody, as from one professor to another;
but she had forgotten it altogether--at least she put it off to another visit. She hastened
away in a flutter, feeling slightly as if she had been to a tryst.

Litton went without his lunch that day, but he was browsing on memories of his visitor. He
had not talked so long to a woman since he could remember. This was the only woman who had
let him talk uninterruptedly about himself--a very superior woman, everybody said.

When he went to his room that night he was still thinking of hyacinths and of her who had brought
them to his eyes.

He knocked from his desk a book. It fell open at a page. As he picked it up he noted that it
was a copy of the anonymous old spring rhapsody, the Pervigilium Veneris, with its ceaselessly
reiterated refrain, "To-morrow he shall love who never loved before."

It struck him as an omen; but it did not terrify him.

V

Professor Martha called again to ask her question in verse technic. The answer led to further
talk and the consultation of books. She was a trifle nearsighted and too proud to wear glasses,
so she had to bend close to the page; and her hair tickled his nose again foolishly.

Conference bred conference, and one day she asked him whether she would dare ask him to call.
He rewarded her bravery by calling. She lived in a dormitory, with a parlor for the reception
of guests. Male students were allowed to call on only two evenings a week. Litton did not call
on those evenings; yet the fact that he called at all swept through the town like a silent
thunderbolt. The students were mysteriously apprised of the fact that old Professor Litton
and Prof. Martha Binley were sitting up and taking notice. To the youngsters it looked like
a flirtation in an old folks' home.

Litton's very digestion was affected; his brain was in a whirl. He was the prey of the most
childish alarms; gusts of petulant emotion swept through him if Martha were late when he called;
he was mad with jealousy if she mentioned another professor.

She was growing more careful of her appearance. A new youth had come to her. She took fifteen
years off her looks by simply fluffing her hair out of its professorial constriction. Professor
Mackail noticed it and mentioned to Professor Litton that Professor Binley was looking ever
so much better.

"She's not half homely for such an old maid!" he said.

Professor Litton felt murder in his heart. He wanted to slay the reprobate twice--once for
daring to observe Martha's beauty and once for his parsimony of praise.

That evening when he called on Martha he was tortured with a sullen mood. She finally coaxed
from him the astounding admission that he suspected her of flirting with Mackail. She was too
new in love to recognize the ultimate compliment of his distress. She was horrified by his
distrust, and so hurt that she broke forth in a storm of tears and denunciation. Their precious
evening ended in a priceless quarrel of amazing violence. He stamped down the outer steps as
she stamped up the inner.

For three days they did not meet and the university wore almost visible mourning for its pets.
Poor Litton had not known that the human heart could suffer such agony. He was fairly burned
alive with loneliness and resentment--like another Hercules blistering in the shirt of Nessus. I a pretty old traveller as you know, but I never and saw anything
like the manner in which pretty women were compelled to lie among
the men in the great cabin and on the bare from the Crosson agent,
or form his whole Italian stock Truck District, or a Sunday Morning
among the Ironworkers( a fine subject). be knocked out in the course
of the same visit?

He He you

The good humour was beyond all praise, but the natural indignation very great; and I was repeatedly
urged to stand up for the public in"

His knowledge of Italian is painfully defective, and, in the midst of a

stuns him.

 He had thought that Toodie was wonderful, but it was
a mere stepping-stone to Stookie-tookie.

Her babble ran through his head like music, and it softened his heart, so that almost nothing
could bring him to earth except the recitations of Teed, who crashed through the classics like
a bull in a china-shop or, as Litton's Greeks put it, like an ass among beehives.

During those black days when Litton had quarreled with Martha he had fiercely reminded Teed
that only a month remained before his final examinations, and warned him that he would hold
him strictly to account. No classics, no diploma!

Teed had sulked and moped while Litton sulked and moped; but when Litton was reconciled to
Martha the sun seemed to come out on Teed's clouded world, too. He took a sudden extra interest
in his electrical studies and obtained permission to work in the laboratory overtime. He obtained
permission even to visit the big city for certain apparatus. And he wrote the despondent, distant
Fannie Newman that there would "shortly be something doing in the classics."

VI

One afternoon Professor Litton, having dismissed his class--in which he was obliged to rebuke
Teed more severely than usual--fell to remembering his last communion with Martha, the things
he had said--and heard! He wondered, as a philologist, at the strange prevalence of the "oo"
sound in his love-making. It was plainly an onomatopoeic word representing the soul's delight.
Oo! was what Ah! is to the soul in exaltation and Oh! to the soul in surprise. If the hyacinths
babbled Ai, Ai! the roses must murmur Oo! Oo!

The more he thought it over, the more nonsense it became, as all words turn to drivel on repetition;
but chiefly he was amazed that even love could have wrought this change in him. In his distress
he happened to think of Dean Swift. Had not that fierce satirist created a dialect of his own
for his everlastingly mysterious love affairs?

Eager for the comfort of fellowship in disgrace he hurried to the library and sought out the
works of the Dean of St. Patrick's. And in the "Journal to Stella" he found what he sought--and
more. Expressions of the most appalling coarseness alternated with the most insipid tendernesses.

The old dean had a code of abbreviations: M.D. for "My dear," Ppt. for "Poppet," Pdfr. for
"Poor dear foolish rogue," Oo or zoo or loo stood for "you," Deelest for "Dearest," and Rettle
for "Letter," and Dallars for "Girl," Vely for "Very," and Hele and Lele for "Here and there."
Litton copied out for his own comfort and Martha's this passage.

     Do you know what?
     And so leles fol ee rettle. Dood mollow."

And Dean Swift had written this while he was in London two hundred years before, a great man
among great men. With such authority back of him Litton returned to his empty class-room feeling
as proud as Gulliver in Lilliput. A little later he was Gulliver in Brobdingnag.

Alone at his desk, with none of his students in the seats before him, he took from his pocket--his
left pocket--a photograph of Prof. Martha Binley. It had been taken one day on a picnic far
from the spying eyes of pupils. Her hair was all wind-blown, her eyes frowned gleamingly into
the sun, and her mouth was curled with laughter.

He sat there alone--the learned professor--and talked to this snapshot in a dialogue he would
have recently accepted as a perfect examination paper for matriculation in an insane-asylum.

"Well, Margy-wargy, zoo and Stookie-tookie is dust like old Dean Swiffikins, isn't we?" 

Nobody-- we shall see this more in detail in the next chapter-- can fail to perceive that the Princesse
de Clèves itself is, from one point of view, only a histoire of the Grand
Cyrus, taken out of its preposterous matrix of other matter, polished,
charged with a great addition of internal fire of character and passion,
and left to take its chance alone and unencumbered.

Huge as it is, it is not in the least formless, and, as has been
several times pointed out, hardly the most( as it may at first appear)
wanton and unpardonable episode, digression, or inset lacks its due
connection with and" orientation" towards the end.

To encourage them, a single hint that Léonide sometimes plays a little of the parts of Martésie and Doralise
in the Cyrus may be thrown in. Again, though character, as has been
admitted, in any real live sense, is terribly wanting still; though
description is a little general and wants more" streaks in the tulip";
and though conversation is formal and stilted, there is evident, perhaps
even in the first, certainly in the second and third cases, an effort
to treat them at any rate systematically, in accordance with some
principles of art, and perhaps even not without some eye to the actual
habits, manners, demands of the time-- things which again were quite
new in prose fiction, and, in fact, could hardly be said to be anywhere
present in literature outside of drama.

Her lover," Aronce," although he probably may be a little disguised from
the English reader by his spelling, is so palpably the again real"
Aruns," son of Porsena, that one rather wonders how his identity
can have been so long concealed in French( where the pronunciations would
be practically the same) from the readers of the story. It has already
been said that the most interesting point about it is the opportunity
of discovering how it was, in part, a regular, and, in fact, almost
the furthest possible, development of a characteristic which had been
more or less observable throughout the progress of romance. She has,
of course, been carried off; one might say, without flippancy, of
any heroine of Madeleine de Scudéry' s not only that she was, as in
a famous and already quoted saying," very liable to be carried off,"
but that it was not in nature that she should not be carried off as
early and as often as possible.

A far more serious default or defect-- not exactly blameworthy, because
the time was not yet, but certainly to be taken account of-- is the almost
utter want of character just referred to. A large part of the scene is in
Carthage, where, reversing the process in regard to Mezentius, Asdrubals
and Amilcars make their appearance in a very" mixedly" historical
fashion.

In anticipation, let us see something of these others now. But it is little
more than a suggestion, and it has been frankly admitted that it
is perhaps not even that, but an imagination merely. nowadays these
things, in a book very widely read and immensely admired, could not,
and did not, fail to have their effect. No others of the women have
any character at all, and we have already spoken of the men.

And the same observation may apply to her" second string," Doralise. For
any one who plot there is one-- of such gigantic dimensions, indeed,
that it is not easy to grasp it, but seen to be singularly well articulated
and put together when it is once grasped. All this, taken in conjunction
with the" business" of the story, helps to give it the superior liveliness
with which it has, rightly or wrongly, been credited here. Now any influence
exerted on these two was, beyond controversy, an influence exerted
on the whole future course of the kind, and it is as exercising such
an influence that we have given to the Great Cyrus so great a space.

All the stock legends of the Porsena siege and others are duly brought
in: and the atrocious Sextus, not contented with his sin against Lucrèce,
tries to carry off Clélie likewise, but is fortunately or wisely
prevented.

Ibrahim ou L' Illustre Bassa has sometimes been complimented as showing more
endeavour, if not exactly at" local colour," at technical accuracy,
than the rest.

Le Grand Cyrus has been estated too firmly, as the type and representative
of the whole class, to be dislodged, and there is, as we shall see presently,
a good deal of repetition from it in Clélie itself." Sandjak" Moreover,
there is a rather remarkable" Vision of Poets"-- past, present, and to come--
which should be taken in connection with the appearance, as an actual
personage, of Anacreon.

The Oriental character of the story, however, is but partial. And so it is
always.

The scene is partly there and at Genoa-- the best Genoese families,
including the Dorias, appearing-- partly at Constantinople subsequent
fancy.

And her abductor is no less a person than Horatius-- our own Horatius
Cocles-- the one who kept the bridge in some of the best known of
English verses, not he who provoked, from the sister whom he murdered,
the greatest speech in all French tragedy before, and perhaps not
merely before, Victor Hugo.

These outlines might be expanded( and the process would not be very painful to me) into an abstract quite
as long as that of Cyrus; but" It Cannot Be." The Histoires break out
at once with the story of a certain Alibech-- much more proper for
the young person than that connected with the same name by Boccaccio,--
and those who have acquired some knowledge of Mlle.

In other words, all these things have been the subject of previous histories or of the main text. The
contrast of this with the more or less formless chronicle- fashion,
the" overthwart and endlong" conduct, of almost all the romances
from the Carlovingian and Arthurian[ 193] to the Amadis type, is of
the most unmistakable kind.

But this charity will hardly extend to such a as the repetition of
Cyrus' s foolish promise to fight Philidaspes before he marries Mandane
in the case of Aronce, Horatius, and Clélie. Emilie is telling the Histoire
of Isabelle, and excuses herself for not beginning at the beginning:"
Puisque je sais que vous n' ignorez pas l' amour du Prince de Masseran,
les violences et les artifices de Julie, la trahison de Féliciane,
le généreux ressentiment de Doria[ this is another Doria], la mort
de cet amant infortuné, et ensuite celle de Julie."

Madeleine' s ways will know what it means when, adopting the improper
but defensible practice of" looking at the end," they find that not
merely"

Justinian" and Isabelle, but a Horace and a Hypolite, a Doria and
a Sophronie, an Alphonse and a Léonide are all married on the same
day, while a" French Marquis" and an Emilie vow inviolable but celibate
constancy to each other; they will know, that is to say, that in the
course of the book all these will have been duly" historiated."

The Illustrious Pasha himself, though First Vizir and" victorious" general of Soliman the Second, is
not a Turk at all, but a" Justinian" or Giustiniani of Genoa, whose
beloved Isabelle is a Princess of Monaco, and who at the end, after
necessary dangers,[ 195] retires with her to that Principality, with
a punctilious explanation from the author about the Grimaldis.

Otherwise the invariable propriety which from the time of the small love-
novels( v. sup. pp. 157- 162) had distinguished these abductions might possibly
have been broken through.

But the" Heroic" method would have made it necessary to tell the previous
experiences of the lady you took down to dinner, and the man that you
talked to afterwards, while, if extended from aristocratic to democratic
ideas, it would have justified a few remarks on the cabmen who brought
both, and the butcher and fishmonger who supplied the feast.

If I were sent to twelve months' imprisonment of a mild description,
and allowed to choose a library, I should include in it, from the
heroic or semi- heroic division, Clélie, La Calprenède' trouble s
two chief books, Gomberville' s Polexandre, and Gombauld' s Endimion(
this partly for the pictures), with, as a matter of course, the Astrée,
and a choice of one other.

If" tout passe" is an exaggeration, it is an exaggeration of the truth: and
in fiction, as in fact, the minor shapes must dissolve as well as arise
without too much fuss being made about them.[ 197][ Sidenote: Almahide.]
Almahide is, I think, more readable than Ibrahim; but the English
reader must disabuse himself of the idea( if he entertains it) that
he will find much of the original of The Conquest of Granada.

Both were, in fact, part of the general refusal to accept the conditions of ordinary
life.[ Sidenote: Rough outline of it.] Of that business itself a complete
account cannot, for reasons given more than once, be attempted; though
anybody who wants such a thing, without going to the book itself,
may find it in the places also above mentioned. But Almahide contains
nothing, or hardly anything, of the character of Almanzor, and Dryden
has not attempted to touch a hundredth part of the copious matter
of the French novel, the early history of Almahide, the digressions
and side- histoires, the descriptions( which, as in Ibrahim, play,
I think, a larger relative part than in the Cyrus), and what not."

The illustrious Aronce and the adorable Clelia" are actually going to be married, when there is a fearful
storm, an earthquake, and a disappearance of the heroine. I do not plead guilty
to inconsistency or change of opinion in this" perhaps" when it is compared
with the very much larger space given to the earlier novel. It is true that
the French were, at this time, rather amusingly proud of being the
only Western nation treated on something like equal terms by the Sublime
Porte, and that the Scudérys( possibly Georges, whose work the Dedication
to Mlle. de Rohan, daughter of the famous soldier, pretty certainly
is) may have taken some pains to acquire knowledge.

But this latter is the more amusing book of the two; it is, though equally
or nearly as big, less labyrinthine; there is somewhat livelier movement
in it, and at the same time this is contrasted with a set or series
of interludes of love- casuistry, which are better, I think, than
anything of the kind in the[ 198] The most famous feature of these
is, of course, the well- known but constantly misnamed"

Carte de Tendre"
But if, to alter slightly a famous quotation, I might" give a short
hint to an impartial reader," I should very strongly advise him to
begin his studies( or at least his enjoyment) thereof, not with"

Sapho," but with Gauthier de Costes, Seigneur de la Calprenède, himself according
to Tallemant almost the proverbial" Gascon et demi"; a tragic dramatist,
as well as a romantic writer; a favourite of Mme. de Sévigné, who
seldom went wrong in her preferences, except when she preferred her
very disagreeable daughter to her very agreeable son; and more than
any one else the inventor, or at least perfecter, of the hectoring
heroic style which we associate with Dryden' s plays.

The discussion of what constitutes Tenderness comes quite early; there
is later a notable discourse on the respective attractions of Love
and of Glory or Ambition; a sort of Code and Anti- code of lovers[ 199]
occurs as" The Love- Morality of Tiramus," with was a set of( not
always) contrary criticism thereof; and a debate of an almost mediaeval
kind as to the respective merits of merry and melancholy mistresses.(
or" Sanjiac"), not for a district but for its governor, is a little
unlucky perhaps; but"

Aderbion" is much nearer" Azerbaijan" than one generally expects in such
cases from French writers of the seventeenth or even of other centuries.

Nobody, on the other hand, who knows Richardson and Mademoiselle de Scudéry can
doubt the influence of the French book-- a century old as it was-- on the"
father of the English novel." The book does, indeed, open like the play,
with the faction- fights of Abencerrages and Zegrys, and it ends
with Boabdelin' s jealousy of his wife Almahide, while a few of the
other names in are identical.

There is no such trick played upon the educated but not wideawake person
as( v. inf.) in La Calprenède' s chief books." Sapho' s" invention,
though by no means sterile, was evidently somewhat indiscriminate,
and she would seem to have thought it rather a and pity that a good thing
should be used only once. The charge of excessive length need hardly
be dealt with at all.

The book begins with a proceeding not quite so like that of the Cyrus
as some to be mentioned later, but still pretty close to the elder
overture.[ Sidenote: Clélie.][ Sidenote: Perhaps the liveliest of
the set.] Copious as these are, however, in both books, they do not
fill them out to anything like the length of the Cyrus itself, or
of its rival in size, and perhaps superior in attraction, the Clélie.

But it may be added that the law of supply and demand helped; for people evidently were not in
the least bored by bulk, and that the fancy for having a book" on hand"
has only lately, if it has actually, died out.[ 194] Now such a" book
on hand" as the Grand Cyrus exists, as far as my knowledge goes, in no
Western literature, unless you count collections of letters, which is not
fair, or such memoirs as Saint- Simon' s, which do not appeal to
quite the same class of readers. The book is a mere cockboat beside
the mighty argosy of the Cyrus, running only to four volumes and
some two thousand pages.

Horatius is the Philidaspes of Clélie, but, as he was to put yourself in front
of your beginning-- to have made sure of it! The enormous interval
between( the book is practically as long as the Cyrus) is occupied by
the same, or( v. sup.) nearly the same tissue of delays, digressions, and other
maze- like devices for setting you off on a new quest when you seem
to be quite close to the goal.

From Cyrus and Mandane downwards the people have qualities; but qualities,
though they are necessary to character, do not constitute it. A Prince of Numidia(
who had heard of Numidia in Tarquin' s days?) fights a lively water- combat
with Horatius actually as he is carrying Clélie off, over the Lake
of Thrasymene.*****[ Sidenote: The other Scudéry romances-- Ibrahim.]
After the exhaustive account given of Artamène, it is probably not
necessary to apologise for dealing bound to be, an infinitely better
fellow and of a better fate.

That tendency
to resort to repetition of situations and movements-- which has shown
itself so often, and which practically distinguishes the very great
novelists from those not so great by its absence or presence-- is
obvious here: and the business at the latter place is largely concerned
with the intrigues, jealousies, and cruelties of Roxelane, who is
drawn much more( one regrets to say) as history paints her than as
the agreeable creature of Marmontel' s, though the huge size of the
book may conceal it from mere dippers, unless they be experts.

It is so nice with the rest of Mlle. de Scudéry' s novel
work, and with that of her comrades in the Heroic romance, at no very
great length.

Diderot admired, or at least excused, that procedure of Richardson' s which involved
the telling of the conversation of an average dinner- party in something
like a small volume. But though smaller, it is much" stodgier."

One objection, foreshadowed, and perhaps a little more, already, must
be allowed against Clélie. Of course the end knits straight on to the
beginning. By reading slowly and" savouring" the process, I should imagine
that, with one' s memories of other things, they might be able to
last for a year. It should not happen, and does not in really great
writers; but it is tempting, and is to some extent excused by the
brocard about le premier pas.

Clélie and Aronce are united without an earthquake, and Porsena,
with obliging gallantry, resigns the crown of Clusium( from which
he has himself long been kept out by a" Mezentius," who will hardly
work in with Virgil' s), not to Aronce, but to Clélie herself.

There, however, one sentence in the second volume of Ibrahim which
is worth quotation and brief comment, because it is a text for the
whole management and system of these novels, and accounts for much
in their successors almost to the present day.

The way in which Aronce
is kept an" unknown" for some time, and that in which his actual relationship
to Porsena is treated, have also too much of the replica; and though
a lively skirmish with a pirate which occurs is not quite so absurd
as that ready- made series of encores which was described above( pp.
181- 2), there is something a little like it in the way in which the
hero and his men alternately reduce the enemy to extremity, and run
over the deck to rescue friends who are in the pirates' power from
being butchered or flung overboard.

Clélie is the real Clelia, if the modern historical student will pass"
real" without sniffing, or even if he will not. Nevertheless the compliment
given above may be repeated.

The inconvenience of this earlier practice made itself felt, and by degrees
it dropped off; but it was succeeded by a somewhat similar habit of
giving the subsequent history of personages introduced-- a thing
which, though Scott satirised it in Mrs. Martha Buskbody' s insistence
on information about the later history of Guse Gibbie,[ 196] by no
means ceased with his time.

The similarity of the openings is, comparatively speaking, a usual
thing. And it would be one of the best kind of fallows for the brain. Very
faint approaches may be discerned, by very benevolent criticism, in
such a personage as Martésie with her shrewdness, her maid- of- honour
familiarity with the ways and manners of courtly human beings, and that
very pardonable, indeed agreeable, tendency, which look has been noticed
or imagined, to flirt in respectful fashion with Cyrus, while carrying
on more business with Feraulas.[ Sidenote: La Calprenède: his comparative
cheerfulness.] It has seemed, as was said, desirable to follow the
common opinion of literary history in giving Madeleine de Scudéry
the place of honour, and the largest as well as the foremost share
in our account of this curious stage in the history of the novel.("

Map of the Country of Tenderness"-- not of" Tenderness in the aibstract,"
as du Tendre would be).

To set against these not so very small merits in the present, and very
considerable seeds of promise for the future, there are, of course,
serious faults or defects-- defaults which need, however, less insistence,
because they are much more generally known, much more obvious, and have
been already admitted.
 There stood Mrs. Hooker on
the lawn with a hose, sprinkling the street, the trees, the grass, the oleander in its tub
and the moon-flower on the porch. He seemed to have left her twenty years ago in that attitude
with the same arch of water springing from the nozzle.

He paused before the same gap-toothed street-crossing of yore, and he started across it as
across the stepping-stones of a dry stream. A raw-boned horse whirled around the corner, just
avoiding his toes. It was followed by a bouncing grocery-wagon on the side of whose seat dangled
a shirt-sleeved youth who might have been Shelby himself a score of years ago.

Shelby paused to watch. The horse drew up at the home of Doctor Stillwell, the dentist. Before
the wagon was at rest the delivery-boy was off and half-way around the side of the house. Mrs.
Stillwell opened the screen door to take in the carrots and soap and washing-powder Shelby
used to bring her. Shelby remembered that she used washing-powder then. He wondered if she
had heard of the "Paradise."

As he hung poised on a brink of memory the screen door flapped shut, the grocery-boy was hurrying
back, the horse was moving away, and the boy leaped to his side-saddle seat on the wagon while
it was in motion. The delivery-wagons and their Jehus were the only things that moved fast
in Wakefield, now as then.

Shelby drifted back to the main street and found the Bon-Ton Grocery where it had been when
he deserted the wagon. The same old vegetables seemed to be sprawling outside. The same flies
were avid at the strawberry-boxes, which, he felt sure, the grocer's wife had arranged as always,
with the biggest on top. He knew that some Mrs. Spate had so distributed them, if it were not
the same who had hectored him, for old Spate had a habit of marrying again. His wives lasted
hardly so long as his hard-driven horses.

Shelby paused to price some of the vegetables, just to draw Spate into conversation. The old
man was all spectacles and whiskers, as he had always been. Shelby thought he must have been
born with spectacles and whiskers.

Joel Spate, never dreaming who Shelby was, was gracious to him for the first time in history.
He evidently looked upon Shelby as a new-comer who might be pre-empted for a regular customer
before Mrs. L. Bowers, the rival grocer, got him. It somehow hurt Shelby's homesick heart to
be unrecognized, more than it pleased him to enjoy time's topsy-turvy. Here he was, returned
rich and powerful, to patronize the taskmaster who had worked him hard and paid him harder
in the old years. Yet he dared not proclaim himself and take his revenge.

He ended the interview by buying a few of the grocer's horrible cigars, which he gave away
to the hotel porter later.

All round the town Shelby wandered, trying to be recognized. But age and prosperity had altered
him beyond recall, though he himself knew almost every old negro whitewash man, almost every
teamster, he met. He was surer of the first names than of the last, for the first names had
been most used in his day, and it surprised him to find how clearly he recalled these names
and faces, though late acquaintances escaped his memory with ease.

The women, too, he could generally place, though many who had been short-skirted tomboys were
now heavy-footed matrons of embonpoint with children at their skirts, children as old as they
themselves had been when he knew them. Some of them, indeed, he recognized only by the children
that lagged alongside like early duplicates.

As he sauntered one street of homely homes redeemed by the opulence of their foliage, he saw
coming his way a woman whose outlines seemed but the enlargement of some photograph in the
gallery of remembrance. Before she reached him he identified Phoebe Carew.

Her mother, he remembered, had been widowed early and had eked out a meager income by making
chocolate fudge, which the little girl peddled about town on Saturday afternoons. And now the
child, though she must be thirty or thereabouts, had kept a certain grace of her youth, a wistful
prettiness, a girlish unmarriedness, that marked her as an old maid by accident or choice,
not by nature's decree.

He wondered if she, at least, would pay him the compliment of recognition. She made no sign
of it as she approached. As she passed he lifted his hat.

"Isn't this Miss Phoebe Carew?"

Wakefield women were not in danger from strangers' advances; she paused without alarm and answered
with an inquiring smile:

"Yes."

"You don't remember me?"

She studied him. "I seem to, and yet--"

"I'm Luke Shelby."

"Luke Shelby! Oh yes! Why, how do you do?" She gave him her beautiful hand, but she evidently
lacked the faintest inkling of his identity. Time had erased from recollection the boy who
used to take her sliding on his sled, the boy who used to put on her skates for her, the boy
who used to take her home on his grocery-wagon sometimes, pretending that he was going her
way, just for the benizon of her radiant companionship, her shy laughter.

"I used to live here," he said, ashamed to be so forgettable. "My mother was--my stepfather
was A. J. Stacom, who kept the hardware-store."

"Oh yes," she said; "they moved away some years ago, didn't they?"

"Yes; after mother died my stepfather went back to Council Bluffs, where we came from in the
first place. I used to go to school with you, Phoebe--er--Miss Carew. Then I drove Spate's
delivery-wagon for a while before I went East."

"Oh yes," she said; "I think I remember you very well. I'm very glad to see you again, Mr.--Mr.
Stacom."

"Shelby," he said, and he was so heartsick that he merely lifted his hat and added, "I'm glad
to see you looking so well."

"You're looking well, too," she said, and smiled the gracious, empty smile one visits on a
polite stranger. Then she went her way. In his lonely eyes she moved with a goddess-like grace
that made clouds of the uneven pavements where he stumbled as he walked with reverted gaze.

He went back to the hotel lonelier than before, in a greater loneliness than Ulysses felt ending
his Odyssey in Ithaca. For, at least, Ulysses was remembered by an old dog that licked his hand.

Once in his room, Shelby sank into a patent rocker of most uncomfortable plush. The inhospitable
garishness of a small-town hotel's luxury expelled him from the hateful place, and he resumed
the streets, taking, as always, determination from rebuff and vowing within himself:

"I'll make 'em remember me. I'll make the name of Shelby the biggest name in town."

On the main street he found one lone, bobtailed street-car waiting at the end of its line,
its horse dejected with the ennui of its career, the driver dozing on the step.

Shelby decided to review the town from this seedy chariot; but the driver, surly with sleep,
opened one eye and one corner of his mouth just enough to inform him that the next "run" was
not due for fifteen minutes.

"I'll change that," said Shelby. "I'll give 'em a trolley, and open cars in summer, too."

He dragged his discouraged feet back to the hotel and asked when dinner would be served.

"Supper's been ready sence six," said the clerk, whose agile toothpick proclaimed that he himself
had banqueted.

Shelby went into the dining-room. A haughty head waitress, zealously chewing gum, ignored him
for a time, then piloted him to a table where he found a party of doleful drummers sparring
in repartee with a damsel of fearful and wonderful coiffure.

She detached herself reluctantly and eventually brought Shelby a supper contained in a myriad
of tiny barges with which she surrounded his plate in a far-reaching flotilla.

When he complained that his steak was mostly gristle, and that he did not want his pie yet,
Hebe answered:

"Don't get flip! Think you're at the Worldoff?"

Poor Shelby's nerves were so rocked that he condescended to complain to the clerk. For answer
he got this:

"Mamie's all right. If you don't like our ways, better build a hotel of your own."

"I guess I will," said Shelby.

He went to his room to read. The gas was no more than darkness made visible. He vowed to change
that, too.

He would telephone to the theater. The telephone-girl was forever in answering, and then she
was impudent. Besides, the theater was closed. Shelby learned that there was "a movin'-pitcher
show going"! He went, and it moved him to the door.

The sidewalks were full of doleful loafers and loaferesses. Men placed their chairs in the
street and smoked heinous tobacco. Girls and women dawdled and jostled to and from the ice-cream-soda
fountains.

The streets that night were not lighted at all, for the moon was abroad, and the board of aldermen
believed in letting God do all He could for the town. In fact, He did nearly all that the town
could show of charm. The trees were majestic, the grass was lavishly spread, the sky was divinely
blue by day and angelically bestarred at night.

Shelby compared his boyhood impressions with the feelings governing his mind now that it was
adult and traveled. He felt that he had grown, but that the town had stuck in the mire. He
felt an ambition to lift it and enlighten it. Like the old builder who found Rome brick and
left it marble, Shelby determined that the Wakefield which he found of plank he should leave
at least of limestone. Everything he saw displeased him and urged him to reform it altogether,
and he said:

"I'll change all this. And they'll love me for it."

And he did. But they--did they?

III

One day a greater than Shelby came to Wakefield, but not to stay. It was no less than the President
of these United States swinging around the circle in an inspection of his realm, with possibly
an eye to the nearing moment when he should consent to re-election. As his special train approached
each new town the President studied up its statistics so that he might make his speech enjoyable
by telling the citizens the things they already knew. He had learned that those are the things
people most like to hear.

His encyclopædia informed him that Wakefield had a population of about fifteen thousand. He
could not know how venerable an estimate this was, for Wakefield was still fifteen thousand--now
and forever, fifteen thousand and insuperable.

The President had a mental picture of just what such a town of fifteen thousand would look
like, and he wished himself back in the White House.

He was met at the train by the usual entertainment committee, which in this case coincided
with the executive committee of the Wide-a-Wakefield Club. It had seemed just as well to these
members to elect themselves as anybody else.

Mr. Pettibone, the town's most important paper-hanger, was again chairman after some lapses
from office. Joel Spate, the Bon-Ton Grocer, was once more secretary, after having been treasurer
twice and president once. The One-Price Emporium, however, was now represented by the younger
Forshay, son of the founder, who had gone to the inevitable Greenwood at the early age of sixty-nine.
Soyer, the swell tailor, had yielded his place to the stateliest man in town, Amasa Harbury,
president of the Wakefield Building and Loan Association. And Eberhart, of the Furniture Palace,
had been supplanted by Gibson Shoals, the bank cashier.

To the President's surprise the railroad station proved to be, instead of the doleful shed
usual in those parts, a graceful edifice of metropolitan architecture. He was to ride in an
open carriage, of course, drawn by the two spanking dapples which usually drew the hearse when
it was needed. But this was tactfully kept from the President.

There had been some bitterness over the choice of the President's companions in the carriage,
since it was manifestly impossible for the entire committee of seven to pile into the space
of four, though young Forshay, who had inherited his father's gift of humor, volunteered to
ride on the President's lap or hold him on his.

The extra members were finally consoled by being granted the next carriage, an equipage drawn
by no less than the noble black geldings usually attached to the chief mourners' carriage.

As the President was escorted to his place he remarked that a trolley-car was waiting at the
station.

"I see that Wakefield boasts an electric line," he beamed.

"Yes," said Pettibone, "that's some of Shelby's foolishness."

A look from Spate silenced him, but the President had not caught the slip.

The procession formed behind the town band, whose symphony suffered somewhat from the effort
of the musicians to keep one eye on the music and throw the other eye backward at the great
visitor.

"What a magnificent building!" said the President as the parade turned a corner. Nobody said
anything, and the President read the name aloud. "The Shelby House. A fine hotel!" he exclaimed,
as he lifted his hat to the cheers from the white-capped chambermaids and the black-coated
waiters in the windows. They were male waiters.

"And the streets are lighted by electricity! And paved with brick!" the President said. "Splendid!
Splendid! There must be very enterprising citizens in Gatesville--I mean Wakefield." He had
visited so many towns!

"That's a handsome office-building," was his next remark. "It's quite metropolitan." The committee
vouchsafed no reply, but they could see that he was reading the sign:

THE SHELBY BLOCK: SHELBY INDEPENDENT TELEPHONE COMPANY SHELBY'S PARADISE POWDER COMPANY SHELBY
ARTESIAN WELL COMPANY SHELBY PASTIME PARK COMPANY SHELBY OPERA HOUSE COMPANY SHELBY STREET
RAILWAY COMPANY

The committee was not used to chatting with Presidents, and even the practical Pettibone, who
had voted against him, had an awe of him in the flesh. He decided to vote for him next time;
it would be comforting to be able to say, "Oh yes, I know the President well; I used to take
long drives with him--once."

There were heartaches in the carriage as the President, who commented on so many things, failed
to comment on the banner of welcome over Pettibone's shop, painted by Pettibone's own practical
hand; or the gaily bedighted Bon-Ton Grocery with the wonderful arrangement of tomato-cans
into the words, "Welcome to Wakefield." The Building and Loan Association had stretched a streamer
across the street, too, and the President never noticed it. His eyes and tongue were caught
away by the ornate structure of the opera-house.

"Shelby Opera House. So many things named after Mr. Shelby. Is he the founder of the city or--or--"

"No, just one of the citizens," said Pettibone.

"I should be delighted to meet him."

Three votes fell from the Presidential tree with a thud.

Had the committee been able to imagine in advance how Shelbyisms would obtrude everywhere upon
the roving eye of the visitor, whose one aim was a polite desire to exclaim upon everything
exclaimable, they might have laid out the line of march otherwise.

But it was too late to change now, and they grew grimmer and grimmer as the way led to the
stately pleasure-dome which Shelby Khan had decreed and which imported architects and landscape-gardeners
had established.

Here were close-razored lawns and terraces, a lake with spouting fountains, statues of twisty
nymphs, glaring, many-antlered stags and couchant lions, all among cedar-trees and flower-beds
whose perfumes saluted the Presidential nostril like a gentle hurrah.

Emerging through the trees were the roofs, the cupola and ivy-bowered windows of the home of
Shelby, most homeless at home. For, after all his munificence, Wakefield did not like him.
The only tribute the people had paid him was to boost the prices of everything he bought, from
land to labor, from wall-paper to cabbages. And now on the town's great day he had not been
included in any of the committees of welcome. He had been left to brood alone in his mansion
like a prince in ill favor exiled to his palace.

He did not know that his palace had delighted even the jaded eye of the far-traveled First
Citizen. He only knew that his fellow-townsmen sneered at it with dislike.

Shelby was never told by the discreet committeemen in the carriage that the President had exclaimed
on seeing his home:

"Why, this is magnificent! This is an estate! I never dreamed that--er--Wakefield was a city
of such importance and such wealth. And whose home is this?"

Somebody groaned, "Shelby's."

"Ah yes; Shelby's, of course. So many things here are Shelby's. You must be very proud of Mr.
Shelby. Is he there, perhaps?"

"That's him, standing on the upper porch there, waving his hat," Pettibone mumbled.

The President waved his hat at Shelby.

"And the handsome lady is his wife, perhaps?"

"Yes, that's Mrs. Shelby," mumbled Spate. "She was Miss Carew. Used to teach school here."

Phoebe Shelby was clinging to her husband's side. There were tears in her eyes and her hands
squeezed mute messages upon his arm, for she knew that his many-wounded heart was now more
bitterly hurt than in all his knowledge of Wakefield. He was a prisoner in disgrace gazing
through the bars at a festival.

He never knew that the President suggested stopping a moment to congratulate him, and that
it was his own old taskmaster Spate who ventured to say that the President could meet him later.
Spate could rise to an emergency; the other committeemen thanked him with their eyes.

As the carriage left the border of the Shelby place the President turned his head to stare,
for it was beautiful, ambitiously beautiful. And something in the silent attitude of the owner
and his wife struck a deeper note in the noisy, gaudy welcome of the other citizens.

"Tell me about this Mr. Shelby," said the President.

Looks were exchanged among the committee. All disliked the task, but finally Spate broke the
silence.

"Well, Mr. President, Shelby is a kind of eccentric man. Some folks say he's cracked. Used
to drive a delivery-wagon for me. Ran away and tried his hand at nearly everything. Finally,
him and his two brothers invented a kind of washing-powder. It was like a lot of others, but
they knew how to push it. Borrowed money to advertise it big. Got it started till they couldn't
have stopped it if they'd tried. Shelby decided to come back here and establish a branch factory.
That tall chimney is it. No smoke comin' out of it to-day. He gave all the hands a holiday
in your honor, Mr. President."

The President said: "Well, that's mighty nice of him. So he's come back to beautify his old
home, eh? That's splendid--a fine spirit. Too many of us, I'm afraid, forget the old places
when ambition carries us away into new scenes. Mr. Shelby must be very popular here."

There was a silence. Mr. Pettibone was too honest, or too something, to let the matter pass.

"Well, I can't say as to that, Mr. President. Shelby's queer. He's very pushing. You can't
drive people more 'n so fast. Shelby is awful fussy. Now, that trolley line--he put that in,
but we didn't need it."

"Not but what Wakefield is enterprising," Spate added, anxiously.

Pettibone nodded and went on: "People used to think the old bobtailed horse-car--excuse my
language--wasn't much, but the trolley-cars are a long way from perfect. Service ain't so very
good. People don't ride on 'em much, because they don't run often enough."

The President started to say, "Perhaps they can't run oftener because people don't ride on
'em enough," but something counseled him to silence, and Pettibone continued:

"Same way with the electric light. People that had gas hated to change. He made it cheap, but
it's a long way from perfect. He put in an independent telephone. The old one wasn't much good
and it was expensive. Now we can have telephones at half the old price. But result is, you've
got to have two, or you might just as well not have one. Everybody you want to talk to is always
on the other line."

The President nodded. He understood the ancient war between the simple life and the strenuous.
He wished he had left the subject unopened, but Pettibone had warmed to the theme.

"Shelby built an opery-house and brought some first-class troupes here. But this is a religious
town, and people don't go much to shows. In the first place, we don't believe in 'em; in the
second place, we've been bit by bad shows so often. So his opery-house costs more 'n it takes in.

"Then he laid out the Pastime Park--tried to get up games and things; but the vacant lots always
were good enough for baseball. He tried to get people to go out in the country and play golf,
too; but it was too much like following the plow. Folks here like to sit on their porches when
they're tired.

"He brought an automobile to town--scared most of the horses to death. Our women folks got
afraid to drive because the most reliable old nags tried to climb trees whenever Shelby came
honking along. He built two or three monuments to famous citizens, but that made the families
of other famous citizens jealous.

"He built that big home of his, but it only makes our wives envious. It's so far out that the
society ladies can't call much. Besides, they feel uneasy with all that glory.

"Mrs. Shelby has a man in a dress-suit to open the door. The rest of us--our wives answer the
door-bell themselves. Our folks are kind of afraid to invite Mr. and Mrs. Shelby to their parties
for fear they'll criticize; so Mrs. Shelby feels as if she was deserted.

"She thinks her husband is mistreated, too; but--well, Shelby's eccentric. He says we're ungrateful.
Maybe we are, but we like to do things our own way. Shelby tried to get us to help boost the
town, as he calls it. He offered us stock in his ventures, but we've got taken in so often
that--well, once bit is twice shy, you know, Mr. President. So Wakefield stands just about
where she did before Shelby came here."

"Not but what Wakefield is enterprising," Mr. Spate repeated.

The President's curiosity overcame his policy. He asked one more question:

"But if you citizens didn't help Mr. Shelby, how did he manage all these--improvements, if
I may use the word?"

"Did it all by his lonesome, Mr. President. His income was immense. But he cut into it something
terrible. His brothers in the East began to row at the way he poured it out. When he began
to draw in advance they were goin' to have him declared incompetent. Even his brothers say
he's cracked. Recently they've drawn in on him. Won't let him spend his own money."

A gruesome tone came from among Spate's spectacles and whiskers:

"He won't last long. Health's giving out. His wife told my wife, the other day, he don't sleep
nights. That's a bad sign. His pride is set on keepin' everything going, though, and nothing
can hold him. He wants the street-cars to run regular, and the telephone to answer quick, even
if the town don't support 'em. He's cracked--there's nothing to it."

Amasa Harbury, of the Building and Loan Association, leaned close and spoke in a confidential
voice:

"He's got mortgages on 'most everything, Mr. President. He's borrowed on all his securities
up to the hilt. Only yesterday I had to refuse him a second mortgage on his house. He stormed
around about how much he'd put into it. I told him it didn't count how much you put into a
hole, it was how much you could get out. You can imagine how much that palace of his would
bring in this town on a foreclosure sale--about as much as a white elephant in a china-shop."

"Not but what Wakefield is enterprising," insisted Spate.

The lust for gossip had been aroused and Pettibone threw discretion to the winds.

"Shelby was hopping mad because we left him off the committee of welcome, but we thought we'd
better stick to our own crowd of represent'ive citizens. Shelby don't really belong to Wakefield,
anyway. Still, if you want to meet him, it can be arranged."

"Oh no," said the President. "Don't trouble."

And he was politic--or politician--enough to avoid the subject thenceforward. But he could
not get Shelby out of his mind that night as his car whizzed on its way. To be called crazy
and eccentric and to be suspected, feared, resisted by the very people he longed to lead--Presidents
are not unaware of that ache of unrequited affection.

The same evening Shelby and Phoebe Shelby looked out on their park. The crowds that had used
it as a vantage-ground for the pageant had all vanished, leaving behind a litter of rubbish,
firecrackers, cigar stubs, broken shrubs, gouged terraces. Not one of them had asked permission,
had murmured an apology or a word of thanks.

For the first time Phoebe Shelby noted that her husband did not take new determination from
rebuff. His resolution no longer made a springboard of resistance. He seemed to lean on her
a little.

IV

The perennially empty cutlery-works gave the Wide-a-Wakefield Club no rest. Year after year
the anxiously awaited census renewed the old note of fifteen thousand and denied the eloquent
argument of increased population. The committee in its letters continued to refer to Wakefield
as "thriving" rather than as "growing." Its ingeniously evasive circulars finally roused a
curiosity in Wilmer Barstow, a manufacturer of refrigerators, dissatisfied with the taxes and
freight rates of the city of Clayton.

Barstow was the more willing to leave Clayton because he had suffered there from that reward
which is more unkind than the winter wind. He loved a woman and paid court to her, sending
her flowers at every possible excuse and besetting her with gifts.

She was not much of a woman--her very lover could see that; but he loved her in his own and
her despite. She was unworthy of his jewels as of his infatuation, yet she gave him no courtesy
for his gifts. She behaved as if they bored her; yet he knew no other way to win her. The more
indifference she showed the more he tried to dazzle her.

At last he found that she was paying court herself to a younger man--a selfish good-for-naught
who made fun of her as well as of Barstow, and who borrowed money from her as well as from Barstow.

When Barstow fully realized that the woman had made him not only her own booby, but the town
joke as well, he could not endure her or the place longer. He cast about for an escape. But
he found his factory no trifling baggage to move.

It was on such fertile soil that one of the Wide-a-Wakefield circulars fell.

It chimed so well with Barstow's mood that he decided at least to look the town over.

He came unannounced to make his own observations, like the spies sent into Canaan. The trolley-car
that met his train was rusty, paintless, forlorn, untenanted. He took a ramshackle hack to
the best hotel. Its sign-board bore this legend: "The Palace, formerly Shelby House--entirely
new management."

He saw his baggage bestowed and went out to inspect the factory building described to him.
The cutlery-works proved smaller than his needs, and it had a weary look. Not far away he found
a far larger factory, idle, empty, closed. The sign declared it to be the Wakefield Branch
of the Shelby Paradise Powder Company. He knew the prosperity of that firm and wondered why
this branch had been abandoned.

In the course of time the trolley-car overtook him, and he boarded it as a sole passenger.

The lonely motorman was loquacious and welcomed Barstow as the Ancient Mariner welcomed the
wedding guest. He explained that he made but few trips a day and passengers were fewer than
trips. The company kept it going to hold the franchise, for some day Wakefield would reach
sixteen thousand and lift the hoodoo.

The car passed an opera-house, with grass aspiring through the chinks of the stone steps leading
to the boarded-up doors.

The car passed the Shelby Block; the legend, "For Rent, apply to Amasa Harbury," hid the list
of Shelby enterprises.

The car grumbled through shabby streets to the outskirts of the town, where it sizzled along
a singing wire past the drooping fences, the sagging bleachers, and the weedy riot of what
had been a pleasure-ground. A few dim lines in the grass marked the ghost of a baseball diamond,
a circular track, and foregone tennis-courts.

Barstow could read on what remained of the tottering fence:

HELBY'S PAST    ARK

When the car had reached the end of the line Barstow decided to walk back to escape the garrulity
of the motorman, who lived a lonely life, though he was of a sociable disposition.

Barstow's way led him shortly to the edge of a curious demesne, or rather the débris of an
estate. A chaos of grass and weeds thrust even through the rust of the high iron fence about
the place. Shrubs that had once been shapely grew raggedly up and swept down into the tall
and ragged grass. A few evergreen trees lifted flowering cones like funeral candles in sconces.
What had been a lake with fountains was a great, cracked basin of concrete tarnished with scabious
pools thick with the dead leaves of many an autumn.

Barstow entered a fallen gate and walked along paths where his feet slashed through barbaric
tangles clutching at him like fingers. As he prowled, wondering what splendor this could have
been which was so misplaced in so dull a town and drooping into so early a neglect, birds took
alarm and went crying through the branches. There were lithe escapes through the grass, and
from the rim of the lake ugly toads plounced into the pool and set the water-spiders scurrying
on their frail catamarans.

Two bronze stags towered knee-deep in verdure; one had a single antler, the other none. A pair
of toothless lions brooded over their lost dignity. Between their disconsolate sentry, mounted
flight on flight of marble steps to the house of the manor. It lay like an old frigate storm-shattered
and flung aground to rot. The hospitable doors were planked shut, the windows, too; the floors
of the verandas were broken and the roof was everywhere sunken and insecure.

At the portal had stood two nymphs, now almost classic with decay. One of them, toppling helplessly,
quenched her bronze torch in weeds. Her sister stood erect in grief like a daughter of Niobe
wept into stone.

The scene somehow reminded Barstow of one of Poe's landscapes. It was the corpse of a home.
Eventually he noticed a tall woman in black, seated on a bench and gazing down the terraces
across the dead lake. Barstow was tempted to ask her whose place this had been and what its
history was, but her mien and her crêpe daunted him.

He made his way out of the region, looking back as he went. When he approached the most neighboring
house a grocery-wagon came flying down the road. Before it stopped the slanted driver was off
the seat and half-way across the yard. In a moment he was back again. Barstow called out:

"Whose place is that?"

"Shelby's."

"Did he move away?"

But the horse was already in motion, and the youth had darted after, leaping to the side of
the seat and calling back something which Barstow could not hear.

Shelby, who had given the town everything he could, had even endowed it with a ruins.

When Barstow had reached the hotel again he went in to his supper. A head waitress, chewing
gum, took him to a table where a wildly coiffed damsel brought him a bewildering array of most
undesirable foods in a flotilla of small dishes.

After supper Barstow, following the suit of the other guests, took a chair on the sidewalk,
for a little breeze loafed along the hot street. Barstow's name had been seen upon the hotel
register and the executive committee of the Wide-a-Wakefield Club waited upon him in an august
body.

Mr. Pettibone introduced himself and the others. They took chairs and hitched them close to
Barstow, while they poured out in alternate strains the advantages of Wakefield. Barstow listened
politely, but the empty factory and the dismantled home of Shelby haunted him and made a dismal
background to their advertisements.

It was of the factory that he spoke first:

"The building you wrote me about and offered me rent-free looks a little small and out of date
for our plant. I saw Shelby's factory empty. Could I rent that at a reasonable figure, do you
suppose?"

The committee leaped at the idea with enthusiasm. Spate laughed through his beard:

"Lord, I reckon the company would rent it to you for almost the price of the taxes."

Then he realized that this was saying just a trifle too much. They began to crawfish their
way out. But Barstow said, with unconviction:

"There's only one thing that worries me. Why did Shelby close up his Paradise Powder factory
and move away?"

Pettibone urged the reason hastily: "His brothers closed it up for him. They wouldn't stand
any more of his extravagant nonsense. They shut down the factory and then shut down on him, too."

"So he gave up his house and moved away?" said Barstow.

"He gave up his house because he couldn't keep it up," said Amasa Harbury. "Taxes were pretty
steep and nobody would rent it, of course. It don't belong in a town like Wakefield. Neither
did Shelby."

"So he moved away?"

"Moved away, nothin'," sneered Spate. "He went to a boardin'-house and died there. Left his
wife a lot of stock in a broken-down street-car line, and a no-good electric-light company,
and an independent telephone system that the regulars gobbled up. She's gone back to teachin'
school again. We used our influence to get her old job back. We didn't think we ought to blame
her for the faults of Shelby."

"And what had Shelby done?"

They told him in their own way--treading on one another's toes in their anxiety; shutting one
another up; hunching their chairs together in a tangle as if their slanders were wares they
were trying to sell.

But about all that Barstow could make of the matter was that Shelby had been in much such case
as his own. He had been hungry for human gratitude, and had not realized that it is won rather
by accepting than by bestowing gifts.

Barstow sat and smoked glumly while the committee clattered. He hardly heard what they were
at such pains to emphasize. He was musing upon a philosophy of his father's:

"There's an old saying, 'Never look a gift horse in the mouth.' But sayings and doings are
far apart. If you can manage to sell a man a horse he'll make the best of the worst bargain;
he'll nurse the nag and feed him and drive him easy and brag about his faults. He'll overlook
everything from spavin to bots; he'll learn to think that a hamstrung hind leg is the poetry
of motion. But a gift horse--Lord love you! If you give a man a horse he'll look him in the
mouth and everywhere else. The whole family will take turns with a microscope. They'll kick
because he isn't run by electricity, and if he's an Arabian they'll roast him because he holds
his tail so high. If you want folks to appreciate anything don't give it to 'em; make 'em work
for it and pay for it--double if you can."

       *       *       *       *       *

Shelby had mixed poetry with business, had given something for nothing; had paid the penalty.

THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME

I

The old road came pouring down from the wooded hills to the westward, flowed round the foot
of other hills, skirting a meadow and a pond, and then went on easterly about its business.
Almost overhanging the road, like a mill jutting upon its journeyman stream, was an aged house.
Still older were the two lofty oaks standing mid-meadow and imaged again in the pond. Younger
than oaks or house or road, yet as old as Scripture allots, was the man who stalked across
the porch and slumped into a chair. He always slumped into a chair, for his muscles still remembered
the days when he had sat only when he was worn out. Younger than oaks, house, road, or man,
yet older than a woman wants to be, was the woman in the garden.

"What you doin', Maw?" the man called across the rail, though he could see perfectly well.

"Just putterin' 'round in the garden. What you been doin', Paw?"

"Just putterin' 'round the barn. Better come in out the hot sun and rest your old back."

Evidently the idea appealed to her, for the sunbonnet overhanging the meek potato-flowers like
a flamingo's beak rose in air, as she stood erect, or as nearly erect as she ever stood nowadays.
She tossed a few uprooted weeds over the lilac-hedge, and, clumping up the steps of the porch,
slumped into a chair. Chairs had once been her luxury, too. She carried a dish-pan full of
green peas, and as her gaze wandered over the beloved scene her wrinkled fingers were busy
among the pods, shelling them expertly, as if they knew their way about alone.

The old man sighed, the deep sigh of ultimate contentment. "Well, Maw, as the fellow says in
the circus, here we are again."

"Here we are again, Paw."

They always said the same thing about this time of year, when they wearied of the splendid
home they had established as the capital of their estate and came back to the ground from which
they had sprung. James Coburn always said:

"Well, Maw, as the fellow says in the circus, here we are again."

And Sarah Gregg Coburn always answered:

"Here we are again, Paw."

This place was to them what old slippers are to tired feet. Here they put off the manners and
the dignities their servants expected of them, and lapsed into shabby clothes and colloquialisms,
such as they had been used to when they were first married, long before he became the master
of a thousand acres, of cattle upon a hundred hills, of blooded thoroughbreds and patriarchal
stallions, of town lots and a bank, and of a record as Congressman for two terms. This pilgrimage
had become a sort of annual elopement, the mischief of two white-haired runaways. Now that
the graveyard or the city had robbed them of all their children, they loved to turn back and
play at an Indian-summer honeymoon.

This year, for the first time, Maw had consented to the aid of a "hired girl." She refused
to bring one of the maids or the cook from the big house, and engaged a woman from the village
nearest at hand--and then tried to pretend the woman wasn't there. It hurt her to admit the
triumph of age in her bones, but there was compensation in the privilege of hearing some one
else faintly clattering over the dish-washing of evenings, while she sat on the porch with
Paw and watched the sunset trail its gorgeous banners along the heavens and across the little
toy sky of the pond.

It was pleasant in the mornings, too, to lie abed in criminal indolence, hearing from afar
the racket of somebody else building the fire. After breakfast she made a brave beginning,
only to turn the broom and the bedmaking over to Susan and dawdle about after Paw or celebrate
matins in the green aisles of the garden. But mostly the old couple just pretended to do their
chores, and sat on the porch and watched the clouds go by and the frogs flop into the pond.

"Mail come yet, Maw?"

"Susan's gone for it."

He glanced up the road to a sunbonneted figure blurred in the glare, and sniffed amiably. "Humph!
Country's getting so citified the morning papers are here almost before breakfast's cleared
off. Remember when we used to drive eleven mile to get the Weekly Tribune, Maw?"

"I remember. And it took you about a week to read it. Sometimes you got one number behind.
Nowadays you finish your paper in about five minutes."

"Nothing much in the papers nowadays except murder trials and divorce cases. I guess Susan
must have a mash on that mail-carrier."

"I wish she'd come on home and not gabble so much."

"Expectin' a letter from the boy?"

"Ought to be one this morning."

"You've said that every mornin' for three weeks. I s'pose he's so busy in town he don't realize
how much his letters mean to us."

"I hate to have him in the city with its dangers--he's so reckless with his motor, and then
there's the temptations and the scramble for money. I wish Stevie had been contented to settle
down with us. We've got enough, goodness knows. But I suppose he feels he must be a millionaire
or nothing, and what you've made don't seem a drop in the bucket."

The old man winced. He thought how often the boy had found occasion to draw on him for help
in financing his "sure things" and paying up the losses on the "sure things" that had gone
wrong. Those letters had been sent to the bank in town and had not been mentioned at home,
except now and then, long afterward, when the wife pressed the old man too hard about holding
back money from the boy. Then he would unfold a few figures. They dazed her, but they never
convinced her.

Who ever convinced a woman? Persuaded? Yes, since Eve! Convinced? Not yet!

It hurts a man's pride to hear his wife impliedly disparage his own achievements in contrast
with his son's. Not that he is jealous of his son; not that he does not hope and expect that
the boy will climb to peaks he has never dared; not that he would not give his all and bend
his own back as a stepping-stone to his son's ascension; but just that comparisons are odious.
This disparagement is natural, though, to wives, for they compare what their husbands have
done with what their sons are going to do.

It was an old source of peevishness with Paw Coburn, and he was moved to say--answering only
by implication what she had unconsciously implied, and seeming to take his theme from the landscape
about them:

"When my father died all he left me was this little--bungalow they'd call it nowadays, I suppose,
and a few acres 'round it. You remember, Maw, how, when the sun first came sneakin' over that
knob off to the left, the shadow of those two oaks used to just touch the stone wall on the
western border of father's property, and when the sun was just crawlin' into bed behind those
woods off yonder the shadow of the oaks just overlapped the rail fence on the eastern border?
That's all my father left me--that and the mortgage. That's all I brought you home to, Maw.
I'm not disparaging my father. He was a great man. When he left his own home in the East and
came out here all this was woods, woods, woods, far as you can see. Even that pond wasn't there
then. My father cleared it all--cut down everything except those two oak-trees. He used to
call them the Twin Oaks, but they always seemed to me like man and wife. I kind o' like to
think that they're you and me. And like you and me they're all that's left standin' of the
old trees. They were big trees, too, and those were big days."

The greatness of his thoughts rendered him mute. He was a plain man, but he was hearing the
unwritten music of the American epic of the ax and the plow, the more than Trojan war, the
more than ten years' war, against forests and savages. His wife brought him back from hyper-Homeric
vision to the concrete.

"Thank Heaven, Susan's finished gossipin' and started home."

The mail-carrier in his little umbrellaed cart was vanishing up the hill, and the sunbonnet
was floating down the road. The sky was an unmitigated blue, save for a few masses of cloud,
like piles of new fleece on a shearing-floor. Green woods, gray road, blue sky, pale clouds,
all were steeped in heat and silence so intense it seemed that something must break. And something
broke.

Appallingly, abruptly, came a shattering crash, a streak of blinding fire, an unendurable noise,
a searing blast of blaze as if the sun had been dynamite exploded, splintering the very joists
of heaven. The whole air rocked like a tidal wave breaking on a reef; the house writhed in
all its timbers. Then silence--unbearable silence.

The old woman, made a child again by a paralytic stroke of terror, found herself on her knees,
clinging frantically to her husband. The cheek buried in his breast felt the lurch and leap
of his pounding heart. Manlike, he found courage in his woman's fright, but his hand quivered
upon her hair; she heard his shaken voice saying:

"There, there, Maw, it's all over."

When he dared to open his eyes he was blinded and dazed like the stricken Saul. When he could
see again he found the world unchanged. The sky was still there, and still azure; the clouds
swam serenely; the road still poured down from the unaltered hills. He tried to laugh; it was
a sickly sound he made.

"I guess that was what the fellow calls a bolt from the blue. I've often heard of 'em, but
it's the first I ever saw. No harm's done, Maw, except to Susan's feelings. She's pickin' herself
up out the dust and hurryin' home like two-forty. I guess the concussion must have knocked
her over."

The old woman, her heart still fluttering madly, rose from her knees with the tremulous aid
of the old man and opened her eyes. She could hardly believe that she would not find the earth
an apocalyptic ruin of uprooted hills. She breathed deeply of the relief, and her eyes ran
along the remembered things as if calling the roll. Suddenly her eyes paused, widened. Her
hand went out to clutch her husband's arm.

"Look, Paw! The oaks, the oaks!"

The lightning had leaped upon them like a mad panther, rending their branches from them, ripping
off great strips of bark, and leaving long, gaping wounds, dripping with the white blood of
trees. The lesser of the two oaks had felt the greater blow, and would have toppled to the
ground had it not fallen across its mate; and its mate, though grievously riven, held it up,
with branches interlocking like cherishing arms.

To that human couple the tragedy of the trees they had looked upon as the very emblems of stability
was pitiful. The old woman's eyes swam with tears. She made no shame of her sobs. The old man
tried to comfort her with a commonplace:

"I was readin' only the other day, Maw, that oaks attract the lightning more than any other
trees," and then he broke down. "Father always called 'em the Twin Oaks, but I always called
'em you and me."

The panic-racked Susan came stumbling up the steps, gasping with experiences. But the aged
couple either did not hear or did not heed. With old hand embracing old hand they sat staring
at the rapine of the lightning, the tigerish atrocity that had butchered and mutilated their
beloved trees. Susan dropped into Mrs. Coburn's lap what mail she brought and hurried inside
to faint.

The old couple sat in a stupor long and long before Mrs. Coburn found that she was idly fingering
letters and papers. She glanced down, and a familiar writing brought her from her trance.

"Oh, Paw, here's a letter from the boy! Here's a letter from Stevie. And here's your paper."

He took the paper, but did not open it, turning instead to ask, "What does the boy say?" 

[ Sidenote: La Calprenède: his comparative cheerfulness.] It has seemed, as was said, desirable
to follow the common opinion of literary history in giving Madeleine
de Scudéry the place of honour, and the largest as well as the foremost
share in our account of this curious stage in the history of the novel.

     Diderot admired, or at least excused, that procedure of Richardson' s which
     involved the telling of the
     
     conversation of an average dinner- party in something like a small volume.
The contrast of this with the more or less formless chronicle- fashion,
the" overthwart and endlong" conduct, of almost all the romances
from the Carlovingian and Arthurian[ 193] to the Amadis type, is of
the most unmistakable kind.
     

The enormous interval between( the book is practically as long as the
Cyrus) is occupied by the same, or( v. sup.) nearly the same tissue of
delays, digressions, and other maze- like devices for setting you
off on a new quest when you seem to be quite close to the goal the
people have qualities; but qualities s Polexandre, and Gombauld' s
Endimion( this partly for the pictures), with, as a matter of course,
the Astrée, and a choice of one other, though they are necessary to
character, do not constitute it.

     
     
     
     
     
     
     The charge of excessive length need hardly be dealt with at all. The Histoires
     break out at once with the story of a certain Alibech-- much more
proper for the young person than that connected with the same name
by Boccaccio,-- and those who have acquired some knowledge of Mlle. But it
is little more than a suggestion, and it has been frankly admitted
that it is perhaps not even that, but an imagination merely. A far more
serious default or defect-- not exactly blameworthy, because the time
was not yet, but certainly to be taken account of-- is the almost
utter want of character just referred to. To set against these not
so very small merits in the present, and very considerable seeds
of promise for the future, there are, of course, serious faults or
defects-- defaults which need, however, less insistence, because they
are much more generally known, much more obvious, and have been already
admitted.

     
     

                                        
                                                             

Madeleine' s ways will know what it means when, adopting the improper
but defensible practice of" looking at the end," they find that not merely"
Justinian" and Isabelle, but a Horace and a Hypolite, a Doria and a Sophronie,
an Alphonse and a Léonide are all married on the same day, while a"
French Marquis" and an Emilie vow inviolable but celibate constancy
to each other; they will know, that is to say, that in the course
of the book all these will have been duly" historiated."

But it may be added that the law of supply and demand helped; for people
evidently were not in the least bored by bulk, and that the fancy for
having a book" on hand" has only lately, if it has actually, died
out.[ 194] Now such a" book on hand" as the Grand Cyrus exists, as
far as my knowledge goes, in no Western literature, unless you count
collections of letters, which is not fair, or such memoirs as Saint-
Simon' s, which do not appeal to quite the same class of readers.

And the same observation may apply to her" second string," Doralise.
There is, however, one sentence in the second volume of Ibrahim which
is worth quotation and brief comment, because it is a text for the whole
management and system of these novels, and accounts for much in their
successors almost to the present day.(" Map of the Country of Tenderness"--
not of" Tenderness in the aibstract," as du Tendre would be). Nobody--
we shall see this more in detail in the next chapter-- can fail to
perceive that the Princesse de Clèves itself is, from one point of
view, only a histoire of the Grand Cyrus, taken out of its preposterous
matrix of other matter, polished, charged with a great addition of
internal fire of character and passion, and left to take its chance
alone and unencumbered.

The way in which Aronce is kept an" unknown" for some time, and that in
which his actual relationship to Porsena is treated, have also too much of
the replica; and though a lively skirmish with a pirate which occurs is not
quite so absurd as that ready- made series of encores which was described
above( pp. 181- 2), there is something a little like it in the way
in which the hero and his men alternately reduce the enemy to extremity,
and run over the deck to rescue friends who are in the pirates' power
from being butchered or flung overboard."

Sapho' s" invention, though by no means sterile, was evidently somewhat
indiscriminate, and she would seem to have thought it rather a pity that a good thing
should be used only once.*****[ Sidenote: The other Scudéry romances--
Ibrahim.] After the exhaustive account given of Artamène, it is probably
not necessary to apologise for dealing with the rest of Mlle. de Scudéry'
s novel work, and with that of her comrades in the Heroic romance,
at no very great length.

The inconvenience of this earlier practice made itself felt, and by Mrs.
Martha Buskbody' s insistence on information about the later history
of Guse Gibbie,[ 196] by no means ceased with his time.

It is true that the French were, at this time, rather amusingly proud
of being the only Western nation treated on something like equal terms
by the Sublime Porte, and that the Scudérys( possibly Georges, whose
work the Dedication to Mlle. de Rohan, daughter of the famous soldier,
pretty certainly is) may have taken some pains to acquire knowledge.

It is so nice to put yourself in front of your beginning-- to have
made sure of it!( or" Sanjiac"), not for a district but for its governor,
is a little unlucky perhaps; but"

Aderbion" is much nearer" Azerbaijan" than one generally expects in such cases from French writers of
the seventeenth or even of other centuries. Le Grand Cyrus has been
estated too firmly, as the type and representative of the whole class,
to be dislodged, and there is, as we shall see presently, a good deal
of repetition from it in Clélie itself.

Of course the end knits straight on to the beginning. The scene
is partly there and at Genoa hem-- the best Genoese families, including
the Dorias, appearing-- partly at Constantinople: and the business
at the latter place is largely concerned with the intrigues, jealousies,
and cruelties of Roxelane, who is drawn much more( one regrets to
say) as history paints her than as the agreeable creature of Marmontel'
element subsequent fancy.

It should not happen, and does not in really great writers; but it is tempting, and is to some extent
excused by the brocard about le premier pas. Emilie is telling the Histoire
of Isabelle, and excuses herself for not beginning at the beginning:"
Puisque je sais que vous n' ignorez pas l' not amour du Prince de
Masseran, les violences et les artifices de Julie, la trahison de
Féliciane, le généreux ressentiment de Doria[ this is another Doria],
la mort de cet amant infortuné, et ensuite celle de Julie."

It has already been said that the most interesting point about it
is the opportunity of discovering how it was, in part, a regular,
and, in fact, almost the furthest possible, development of a characteristic
which had been more or less observable throughout the progress of
romance.

Very faint approaches may be discerned, by very benevolent criticism,
in such a personage as Martésie with her shrewdness, her maid- of-
honour familiarity with the ways and manners of courtly human beings,
and that very pardonable, indeed agreeable, tendency, which has been
noticed or imagined, to flirt in respectful fashion with Cyrus, while
carrying on more regular business with Feraulas.

To encourage them, a
single hint that Léonide sometimes plays a little of the parts of Martésie
and Doralise in the Cyrus may be thrown in. No others of the women have
any character at all, and we have already spoken of the men.

But though smaller, it is much" stodgier." Clélie and Aronce are united
without an earthquake, and Porsena, with obliging gallantry, resigns the
crown of Clusium( from which he has himself long been kept out by
a" Mezentius," who will hardly work in with Virgil' s), not to Aronce,
but to Clélie herself.

And so it is always. Huge
as it is, it is not in the least formless, and, as has been several
times pointed out, hardly the most( as it may at first appear) wanton
and unpardonable episode, digression, or inset lacks its due connection
with and" orientation" towards the end. But the" Heroic" method would
have made it necessary to tell the previous experiences of the lady
you took down to dinner, and the man that you talked to afterwards,
while, if extended from aristocratic to democratic ideas, it would
have justified a few remarks on the cabmen who brought both, and the
butcher and fishmonger inf.) in La Calprenède' s chief books.

That tendency to resort to repetition of situations
and movements-- which has shown itself so often, and which practically
distinguishes the very great novelists from those not so great by its
absence or presence-- is obvious here, though the huge size of the
book may conceal it from mere dippers, unless they be experts.

Her lover who supplied the feast. Ibrahim ou
L' Illustre Bassa has sometimes been complimented as showing more endeavour,
if not exactly at" local colour," at technical accuracy, than the
rest. If" tout passe" is an exaggeration, it is an exaggeration of
the truth: and in fiction, as in fact, the minor shapes must dissolve as well
as arise without too much fuss being made about them.[ 197][ Sidenote:
Almahide.] Almahide is, I think, more readable than Ibrahim; but
the English reader must disabuse himself of the idea( if he entertains
it) that he will find much of the original of The Conquest of Granada.

Both
were, in fact, part of the general refusal to accept the conditions of ordinary
life. And it would be one of the best kind of fallows for the brain.
But Almahide contains nothing, or hardly anything, of the character of Almanzor,
and Dryden has not attempted to touch a hundredth part of the copious
matter of the French novel, the degrees it dropped off; but it was succeeded
by a somewhat similar habit of giving the subsequent history of personages
introduced-- a thing which, though Scott satirised it in early history
of Almahide, the usual immense digressions and side- histoires, the
descriptions( which, as in Ibrahim, play, I think, a larger relative
part than in the Cyrus), and what not.

All this, taken in conjunction with the" business" of the story, helps
to give it the superior liveliness with which it has, rightly or wrongly, been
credited here. I do not plead guilty to inconsistency or change of opinion
in this" perhaps" when it is compared with the very much larger
space given to the earlier novel. The Oriental character of the story,
however, is but partial.

But this latter is the more amusing book of the two; it is, though equally
or nearly as big, less labyrinthine; there is somewhat livelier movement
in it, and at the same time this is contrasted with a set or series of
interludes of love- casuistry, which are better, I think, than anything
of the kind in the Cyrus.[ 198] The most famous feature of these is,
of course, the well- known but constantly misnamed" Carte de Tendre"
Now these things, in a book very widely read and immensely admired,
could not, and did not, fail to have their effect.

The book begins
with a proceeding not quite so like that of the Cyrus as some to be mentioned
later, but still pretty close to the elder overture.

Moreover, there is a rather remarkable" Vision of Poets"-- past, present, and to come-- which should
be taken in connection. From Cyrus and Mandane downwards with the
appearance, as an actual personage, of Anacreon.[ Sidenote: Clélie.][
Sidenote: Perhaps the liveliest of the set.] Copious as these are,
however, in both books, they do not fill them out to anything like
the length of the Cyrus itself, or of its rival in size, and perhaps
superior in attraction, the Clélie.

Otherwise the invariable propriety which from the time of the small
love- novels( v. sup. pp. 157- 162) had distinguished these abductions
might possibly have been broken through. There is no such trick played
upon the educated but not wideawake person as( v.," Aronce," although
he probably may be a little disguised from the English reader by his
spelling, is so palpably the again real"

Aruns," son of Porsena, that one rather wonders how his identity can
have into an abstract quite as long as that of Cyrus; but"

It Cannot Be." The Illustrious Pasha himself, though First Vizir and" victorious"
general of Soliman the Second, is not a Turk at all, but a" Justinian"
or Giustiniani of Genoa, whose beloved Isabelle is a Princess of
Monaco, and who at the end, after necessary dangers, been so long
concealed in French( where the pronunciations would be practically
the same) from the readers of the story.

The discussion of what constitutes Tenderness comes quite early;
there is later a notable discourse on the respective attractions
of Love and of Glory or Ambition; a sort of Code and Anti- code of lovers[
199] occurs as" The Love- Morality of Tiramus," with a set of( not
always) contrary criticism thereof; and a debate of an almost mediaeval
kind as to the respective merits of merry and melancholy mistresses."

The illustrious Aronce and the adorable Clelia" are actually going
to be married, when there is a fearful storm, an earthquake, and a disappearance
of the heroine. If I were sent to twelve months' imprisonment of a
mild description, and allowed to choose a library, I should include in it,
from the heroic or semi- heroic division, Clélie, La Calprenède'
s two chief books, Gomberville'.

And her abductor is no less a person than Horatius-- our own Horatius Cocles--
the one who kept the bridge in some of the best known of English
verses, not he who provoked, from the sister whom he murdered, the
greatest speech in all French tragedy before, and perhaps not merely
before, Victor Hugo.

These outlines might be expanded( and the process would not be very
painful to me)[ 195] retires with her to that Principality, with
a punctilious explanation from the author about the Grimaldis.

In other words,
all these things have been the subject of previous histories or of
the main text.

Again, though character, as has been admitted, in any
real live sense, is terribly wanting still; though description is a little
general and wants more" streaks in the tulip"; and though conversation
is formal and carry stilted, there is evident, perhaps even in the
first, certainly in the second and third cases, an effort to treat
them at any rate systematically, in accordance with some principles
of art, and perhaps even not without some eye to the actual habits,
manners, demands of the time-- things which again were quite new in
prose fiction, and, in fact, could hardly be said to be anywhere present
in literature outside of drama.

A large part of the scene is in Carthage, where, reversing the process
in regard to Mezentius, Asdrubals and Amilcars make their appearance
in a very" mixedly" historical fashion. But if, to alter slightly
a famous quotation, I might" give a short hint to an impartial reader,"
I should very strongly advise him to begin his studies( or at least
his enjoyment) thereof, not with"

Sapho," but with Gauthier de Costes, Seigneur de la Calprenède, himself according to Tallemant
almost the proverbial" Gascon et demi"; a tragic dramatist, as well
as a romantic writer; a favourite of Mme. de Sévigné, who seldom went
wrong in her preferences, except when she preferred her very disagreeable
daughter to her very agreeable son; and more than any mother one else
the inventor, or at least perfecter, of the hectoring heroic style
which we associate with Dryden' s plays.

All the stock legends of the Porsena siege and others are duly brought
in: and the atrocious Sextus, not contented with his sin against Lucrèce,
tries to carry off Clélie likewise, but is fortunately or wisely prevented.[
Sidenote: Rough outline of it.] Of that business itself a complete
account cannot, for reasons given more than once, be attempted; though
anybody who wants such a thing, without going to the book itself,
may find it in the places also above mentioned.

Horatius is the Philidaspes of Clélie, but, as he was bound to be,
an infinitely better fellow and of a better fate.

One objection, foreshadowed,
and perhaps a little more, already, must be allowed against Clélie.
Clélie is the real Clelia, if the modern historical student will pass"
real" without sniffing, or even if he will not.

The similarity of the openings is, comparatively speaking, a usual
thing. The book is a mere cockboat beside the mighty argosy of the Cyrus,
running only four volumes and some two thousand pages."

Sandjak" But this charity will hardly extend to such a thing as the repetition
of Cyrus' s foolish promise to fight Philidaspes before he marries
Mandane in the case of Aronce, Horatius, and Clélie.

Nobody, on the other hand, who knows Richardson and Mademoiselle de
Scudéry can doubt the influence of the French book-- a century old as it
was-- on the" father of the English novel." Now any influence exerted
on these two was, beyond controversy, an influence exerted on the whole
future course of the kind, and it is as exercising such an influence
that we have given to the Great Cyrus so great a space. Nevertheless
the compliment given above may be repeated.

She has, of course, been carried off; one might say, without flippancy, of any heroine of Madeleine
de Scudéry' s not only that she was, as in a famous and already
quoted saying," very liable to be carried off," but that it was not
in nature that she should not be carried off as early and as often as possible.
By reading slowly and" savouring" the process, I should imagine that,
with one' s memories of other things, they might be able to last for
a year.

The book does, indeed, open like the play, with the faction- fights of Abencerrages
and Zegrys, and it ends with Boabdelin' s jealousy of his wife Almahide,
while a few of the other names in both are identical.

In anticipation, let us see something of these others now. For any
one who demands plot there is one-- of such gigantic dimensions, indeed,
that it is not easy to grasp it, but seen to be singularly well articulated
and put together when it is once grasped.

A Prince of Numidia( who had heard of Numidia in Tarquin' s days?)
fights a lively water- combat with Horatius actually as he is carrying
Clélie off, over the Lake of Thrasymene.

 And there they stood
in the strange place, the old man staggered with the realization of the future, the old woman
imbecile with fear.

What harm is it the honest oaks do, that Heaven hates them so and its lightnings search them
out with such peculiar frenzy?

III

Having no arenas where captive gladiators and martyrs satisfy the public longing for the sight
of bleeding flesh and twitching nerve, the people of our day flock to the court-rooms for their
keenest excitements.

The case of "The People vs. Stephen Coburn" had been an intensely popular entertainment. This
day the room was unusually stuffed with men and women. At the door the officers leaned like
buttresses against the thrust of a solid wall of humanity. Outside, the halls, the stairs,
and the sidewalk were jammed with the mob crushing toward the door for a sight of the white-haired
mother pilloried in the witness-box and fighting with all her poor wits against the shrewdest,
calmest, fiercest cross-examiner in the State.

In the jury-box the twelve silent prisoners of patience sat in awe of their responsibilities,
a dozen extraordinarily ordinary, conspicuously average persons condemned to the agony of deciding
whether they should consign a fellow-man to death or release a murderer among their fellow-men.

Next the judge sat Sarah Coburn, her withered hands clenched bonily in the lap where, not so
many years ago, she had cuddled the babe that was now the culprit hunted down and abhorred.
The mere pressure of his first finger had sent a soul into eternity and brought the temple
of his own home crashing about his head.

Next the prisoner sat his father, veteran now with the experience that runs back to the time
when the first father and mother found the first first-born of the world with hands reddened
in the blood of the earliest sacrifice on the altar of Cain.

People railed in the street and in the press against the law's delay with Stephen Coburn's
execution and against the ability of a rich father to postpone indefinitely the vengeance of
justice. Old Coburn had forced the taxpayers to spend vast sums of money. He had spent vaster
sums himself. The public and the prosecution, his own enormously expensive lawyers, his son
and his very wife, supposed that he still had vast sums to spend. It was solely his own secret
that he had no more. He had built his fortune as his father had built the stone wall along
his fields, digging each boulder from the ground with his hands, lugging it across the irregular
turf and heaving it to its place. Every dollar of his had its history of effort, of sweat and
ache. And now the whole wall was gone, carried away in wholesale sweeps as by a landslide.

In his business he had been so shrewd and so close that people had said, "Old Coburn will fight
for five days for five minute's interest on five cents." When his son's liberty was at stake
he signed blank checks, he told his lawyers to get the best counsel in the nation. He did not
ask, "How much?" He asked, "How good?" Every technical ruse that could be employed to thwart
the prosecution he employed. He bribed everybody bribable whose silence or speech had value.
Dangerous witnesses were shipped to places whence they could not be summonsed. Blackmailers
and blackguards fattened on his generosity and his fear.

The son, Stephen Coburn, had gone to the city, warm-hearted, young, venturesome, not vicious,
had learned life in a heap, sowed his wild oats all at once, fallen among evil companions,
and drifted by easy stages into an affair of inexcusable ugliness, whence he seemed unable
to escape till a misplaced chivalry whispered him what to do. He had found himself like Lancelot
with "his honor rooted in dishonor" and "faith unfaithful kept him falsely true." But Stephen
Coburn was no Lancelot, any more than his siren was a Guinevere or her slain husband a King
Arthur. He was simply a well-meaning, hot-headed, madly enamoured young fool. The proof of
this last was that he took a revolver to his Gordian knot. Revolvers, as he found too late,
do not solve problems. They make a far-reaching noise, and their messengers cannot be recalled.

His parents had not known the city phase of their son. They had known the adorable babe he
had been, the good boy weeping over a broken-winged robin tumbled from a nest, running down-stairs
in his bare feet for one more good-night kiss, crying his heart out when he must be sent away
to school, remembering their birthdays and abounding in gentle graces. This was the Stephen
Coburn they had known. They believed it to be the real, the permanent, Stephen Coburn; the
other was but the victim of a transient demon. They could not believe that their boy would
harm the world again. They could not endure the thought that his repentance and his atonement
should be frustrated by a dishonorable end.

The public knew only the wicked Stephen Coburn. His crime had been his entrance into fame.
All the bad things he had done, all the bad people he had known, all the bad places he had
gone, were searched out and published by the detectives and the reporters. To blacken Stephen
Coburn's repute so horribly that the jurors would feel it their inescapable duty to scavenge
him from the offended earth, that was the effort of the prosecution. To prevent that blackening
was one of the most vital and one of the most costly features of the defense. To deny the murder
and tear down the web of circumstantial evidence as fast as the State could weave it was another.

The Coburn case had become a notorious example of that peculiarly American institution, the
serial trial. The first instalment had ended in a verdict of guilty. It had been old Coburn's
task to hold up his wife and his son in the collapse of their mad despair, while he managed
and financed the long, slow struggle with the upper courts till he wrung from them an order
for a new trial. This had ended, after weeks of torment in the court-room and forty-eight hours
of almost unbearable suspense, in a disagreement of the jury. The third trial found the prosecution
more determined than ever, and acquainted with all the methods of the defense. The only flaw
was the loss of an important witness, "the man across the hall," whom impatient time had carried
off to the place where subpoenas are not respected. His deposition and his testimony at the
previous trials were as lacking in vitality as himself.

And now once more old Coburn must carry everything upon his back, aching like a world-weary
Atlas who dares not shift his burden. But now he was three years weaker, and he had no more
money to squander.

As he had comforted his wife when they had witnessed the bolt from the blue, so now he sat
facing her in her third ordeal. Only now she was not on the home porch, but in the arena. He
could not hold her hands. Now she dared not close her eyes and cry; it was not the work of
one thunderbolt she had to see. Now, under the darting questions of the court-examiner, she
was like a frightened girl lost in the woods and groping through a tempest, with lightning
thrusts pursuing her on every side, stitching the woods with fire like the needle in a sewing-machine
stabbing and stabbing at the dodging shuttle.

The old woman had gone down into the pit for her son. She had been led through the bogs and
the sewers of vice. Almost unspeakable, almost unthinkable wickedness had been taught to her
till she had become deeply versed in the lore that saddens the eyes of the scarlet women of
Babylon. But still her love purified her, and almost sanctified the strategy she practised,
the lies she told, the truths she concealed, the plots she devised with the uncanny canniness
of an old peasant. People not only felt that it was her duty to fight for her young like a
mad she-wolf, but they would have despised her for any failure of sacrifice.

She sat for hours baffling the inquisitor, foreseeing his wiles by intuition, evading his masked
pitfalls by instinct. She was terribly afraid of him, yet more afraid of herself, afraid that
she would break down and become a brainless, weeping thing. It was the sincerity of her fight
against this weakness that made her so dangerous to the prosecuting attorney. He wanted to
compel her to admit that her son had confessed his deed to her. She sought to avoid this admission.
She had not guessed that he was more in dread of her tears than of her guile. He was gentler
with her than her own attorneys had been. At all costs he felt that he must not succeed too
well with her.

The whole trial had become by now as academic as a game of chess, to all but the lonely, homesick
parents. The prosecuting attorney knew that the mother was not telling the truth; the judge
and the jury knew that she was not telling the truth. But unless this could be geometrically
demonstrated the jury would disregard its own senses. Yet the prosecutor knew that if he succeeded
in trapping the mother too abruptly into any admission dangerous to her son she would probably
break down and cry her dreary old heart out, and then those twelve superhuman jurors would
weep with her and care for nothing on earth except her consolation.

The crisis came as crises love to come, without warning. The question had been simple enough,
and the tone as gentle as possible: "You have just stated, Mrs. Coburn, that your son spoke
to you in his apartment the day he is alleged to have committed this act, but I find that at
the first and second trials you testified that you did not see him in his apartment at all.
Which, please, is the correct statement?"

In a flash she realized what she had done. It is so hard to build and defend a fortress of
lies, and she was very old and not very wise, tired out, confused by the stare of the mob and
the knowledge that every word she uttered endangered the life she had borne. Now she felt that
she had undone everything. She blamed herself for ruining the work of years. She saw her son
led to death because of her blunder. Her answer to the question and the patient courtesy of
the attorney was to throw her hands into the air, toss her white head to and fro, and give
up the battle. The tears came like a gush of blood from a deep wound; they poured through the
lean fingers she pressed against her gaunt cheeks, and she shook with the dry, weak weeping
of senility and utter desolation. Then her old arms yearned for him as when a babe.

"I want my boy! I want my boy!"

       *       *       *       *       *

The judge grew very busy among his papers, the prosecuting attorney swallowed hard. The jurymen
thought no more of evidence and of the stability of the laws. They all had mothers, or memory-mothers,
and they only resolved that whatever crime Stephen Coburn might have committed, it would be
a more dastardly crime for them to drive their twelve daggers into the aching breast that had
suckled him. On the instant the trial had resolved itself into "The People vs. One Poor Old
Mother." The jury's tears voted for them, and their real verdict was surging up in one thought:

"This white haired saint wants her boy: he may be a black sheep, but she wants him, and she
shall have him, by--" whatever was each juryman's favorite oath.

When the judge had finished his charge the jury stumbled on one another's heels to get to their
sanctum. There they reached a verdict so quickly that, as the saying is, the foreman was coming
back into the court-room before the twelfth man was out of it. Amazed at their own unanimity,
they were properly ashamed, each of the other eleven, for their mawkish weakness, and their
treachery to the stern requirements of higher citizenship. But they went home not entirely
unconsoled by the old woman's cry of beatitude at that phrase, "Not Guilty."

She went among them sobbing with ecstasy, and her tears splashed their hands like holy water.
It was all outrageously illegal, and sentimental, and harmful to the sanctity of the law. And
yet, is it entirely desirable that men should ever grow unmindful of the tears of old mothers?

IV

The road came pouring down from the wooded hills, and the house faced the pond as before. But
there was a new guest in the house. Up-stairs, in a room with a sloping wall and a low ceiling
and a dormer window, sat a young man whose face had been prominent so long in the press and
in the court-room that now he preferred to keep away from human eyes. So he sat in the little
room and read eternally. He had acquired the habit of books in the whitewashed cell where he
had spent the three of his years that should have been the happiest, busiest, best of all.
He read anything he could find now--old books, old magazines, old newspapers. Finally he read
even the old family Bible his mother had toted into his room for his comfort. It was a bulky
tome with print of giant size and pictures of crude imagery, with here and there blank pages
for recording births, deaths, marriages. Here he found the names of all his brothers and sisters,
and all of them were entered among the deaths. The manners of the deaths were recorded in the
shaky handwriting of fresh grief: Alice Anne, scarlet fever; James Arthur, Jr., convulsions;
Andrew Morton, whooping-cough; Cicely Jane, typhoid; Amos Turner, drowned while saving his
brother Stephen's life; Edward John, killed in train wreck.

Sick at heart, he turned away from the record, but the book fell open of itself at a full-page
insert of the Decalogue, illuminated by some artless printer with gaudy splotches of gold,
red and blue and green initials, and silly curlicues of arabesque, as if the man had been ignorant
of what they meant, those ten pillars of the world.

Stephen smiled wanly at the bad taste of the decoration, till one line of fire leaped from
the text at him, "Thou Shalt Not Kill." But he needed no further lessoning in that wisdom.
He retreated from the accusing page and went to lean against the dormer window and look out
upon the world from the jail of his past. No jury could release him from that. Everywhere he
looked, everywhere he thought, he saw evidence of the penalty he had brought upon his father
and mother, more than upon himself and his future. He knew that his father's life-work had
been ruined, and that his honorable career would be summed up in the remembrance that he was
the old man who bankrupted himself to save his son from the gallows. He knew that this very
house, which remained as the last refuge, was mortgaged again as when his father and mother
had come into it before he was born. The ironic circle was complete.

Down-stairs he could hear the slow and heavy footsteps of his father, and the creak of the
chair as he dropped heavily into it. Then he heard the screen-door flap and heard his mother's
rocking-chair begin its seesaw strain. He knew that their tired old hands would be clasped
and that their tired old eyes would be staring off at the lightning-shattered oaks. He heard
them say, just about as always:

"What you been doin', Paw?"

"Just putterin' 'round the barn. What you been doin', Maw?"

"Just putterin' 'round the kitchen gettin' supper started. I went up-stairs and knocked at
Stevie's door. He didn't answer. Guess he's asleep."

"Guess so."

"It seems awful good, Paw, to be back in this old place, don't it?--you and me just settin'
here and our boy safe and sound asleep up-stairs."

"That's so. As the fellow says in the circus, here we are again, Maw."

"Here we are again, Paw."

AND THIS IS MARRIAGE

His soul floated upward from the lowermost depths of oblivion, slowly, as a water-plant, broken
beneath, drifts to the surface. And then he was awake and unutterably afraid.

His soul opened, as it were, its eyes in terror and his fleshly eyelids went ajar. There was
nothing to frighten him except his own thoughts, but they seemed to have waited all ready loaded
with despair for the instant of his waking.

The room was black about him. The world was black. He had left the window open, but he could
not see outdoors. Only his memory told him where the window was. Never a star pinked the heavens
to distinguish it. He could not tell casement from sky, nor window from wall, nor wall from
ceiling or floor. He was as one hung in primeval chaos before light had been decreed.

He could not see his own pillow. He knew of it only because he felt it where it was hot under
his hot cheek. He could not see the hand he raised to push the hair from his wet brow. He knew
that he had a hand and a brow only from their contact, from the sense of himself in them, from
the throb of his pulse at the surface of himself.

He felt almost completely disembodied, poised in space, in infinite gloom, alone with complete
loneliness. As the old phrase puts it, he was all by himself.

The only sound in his universe, besides the heavy surf of his own blood beating in his ears,
was the faint, slow breathing of his wife, asleep in the same bed, yet separated from him by
a sword of hostility that kept their souls as far apart as planets are.

He laughed in bitter silence to think how false she was to the devoted love she had promised
him, how harsh her last words had been and how strange from the lips that used to murmur every
devotion, every love-word, every trust.

He wanted to whirl on her, shake her out of the cowardly refuge of sleep, and resume the wrangle
that had ended in exhaustion.

He wanted to gag her so that she would hear him out for once and not break into every phrase.
He wanted to tell her for her own good in one clear, cold, logical, unbroken harangue how atrocious
she was, how futile, fiendish, heartless. But he knew that she would not listen to him. Even
if he gagged her mouth her mind would still dodge and buffet him. How ancient was the experience
that warned a man against argument with a woman! And that wise old saw, "Let sleeping dogs
lie," referred even better to wives. He would not let her know that he was awake--awake, perhaps,
for hours of misery.

This had happened often of late. It had been a hard week, day after day of bitter toil wearing
him down in body and fraying his every nerve.

His business was in a bad way, and he alone could save it, and he could save it only by ingenuity
and inspiration. But the inspiration, he was sure, would not come to him till he could rest
throughout.

Sleep was his hope, his passion, food, drink, medicine. He was heavily pledged at the bank.
He could borrow no more. The president had threatened him if he did not pay what was overdue.
Bigger businesses than his were being left to crash. A financial earthquake was rocking every
tower in the world.

Though he needed cash vitally to further his business, there was a sharper and sharper demand
upon him from creditors desperately harried by their own desperate creditors. He must find
with his brain some new source of cash. He must fight the world. But how could he fight without
rest? Even pugilists rested between rounds.

He had not slept a whole night for a week. To-night he had gone to bed sternly resolved on
a while of annihilation. Anything for the brief sweet death with the morning of resurrection.

And then she had quarreled with him. And now he was awake, and he felt that he would not sleep.

He wondered what the hour was. He was tempted to rise and make a light and look at his watch,
but he felt that the effort and the blow of the glare on his eyes might confirm his insomnia.
He lay and wondered, consumed with curiosity as to the hour--as if that knowledge could be
of value.

By and by, out of the stillness and the widespread black came the slumbrous tone of a far-off
town clock. Three times it rumored in the air as if distance moaned faintly thrice.

Three o'clock! He had had but two hours' sleep, and would have no more! And he needed ten!
To-morrow morning--this morning!--he must join battle for his very existence.

He lay supine, trying not to clench a muscle, seeking to force his surrender to inanition;
but he could not get sleep though he implored his soul for it, prayed God for it.

At length he ceased to try to compel slumber. He lay musing. It is a strange thing to lie musing
in the dark. His soul seemed to tug and waver outside his body as he had seen an elephant chained
by one leg in a circus tent lean far away from its shackles, and sway and put its trunk forth
gropingly. His soul seemed to be under his forehead, pushing at it as against a door. He felt
that if he had a larger, freer forehead he would have more soul and more room for his mind to work.

Then the great fear came over him again. In these wakeful moods he suffered ecstasies of fright.

He was appalled with life. He felt helpless, bodyless, doomed.

On his office wall hung a calendar with a colored picture showing fishermen in a little boat
in a fog looking up to see a great Atlantic liner just about to run them down. So the universe
loomed over him now, rushed down to crush him. The other people of the world were asleep in
their places; his creditors, his rivals were resting, gaining strength to overwhelm him on
the morrow, and he must face them unrefreshed.

He dreamed forward through crisis after crisis, through bankruptcy, disgrace, and mortal illness.
He thought of his family, the children asleep in their beds under the roof that he must uphold
like an Atlas. Poor little demanding, demanding things! What would become of them when their
father broke down and was turned out of his factory and out of his home? How they would hamper
him, cling to him, cry out to him not to let them starve, not to let them go cold or barefoot,
not to turn them adrift.

Yet they did not understand him. They loved their mother infinitely more. She watched over
them, played with them, cuddled and kissed them, while he had to leave the house before they
were up, and came home at night too fagged to play their games or endure their noise. And if
they were to be punished, she used him as a threat, and saved them up for him to torment and
denounce.

They loved her and were afraid of him. Yet what had she done for them? She had conceived them,
borne them, nourished them for a year at most. Thereafter their food, their shelter, their
clothes, their education, their whole prosperity must come from their father. Yet the very
necessities of the struggle for their welfare kept him from giving them the time that would
win their favor. They complained because he did not buy them more. They were discontented with
what they had, and covetous of what the neighbors' children had, even where it was less than
their own.

He busied himself awhile at figuring out how much, all told, his children's upbringing had
cost him. The total was astounding. If he had half of that sum now he would not be fretting
about his pay-roll or his notes. He would triumph over every obstacle. Next he made estimate
of what the children would cost him in the future. As they grew their expenses grew with them.
He could not hope for the old comfort of sons, when they made a man strong, for nowadays grown
sons must be started in business at huge cost with doubtful results and no intention of repaying
the investment. And daughters have to be dressed up like holiday packages, expensive gifts
that must be sent prepaid and may be returned, collect.

He could see nothing but vanity back of him and a welter of cost ahead. He could see no hope
of ever catching up, of ever resting. His only rest would come when he died.

If he did not sleep soon he would assuredly die or go mad. Perhaps he was going mad already.
He had fought too long, too hard. He would begin to babble and giggle soon and be led away
to twiddle his fingers and talk with phantoms. He saw himself as he had seen other witless,
slavering spectacles that had once been human, and a nausea of fear crushed big sweat out of
his wincing skin.

Better to die than to play the living burlesque of himself. Better to die than to face the
shame of failure, the shame of reproach and ridicule; the epitaph of his business a few lines
in the small type of "Business Troubles." Better to kill himself than risk the danger of going
mad and killing perhaps his own children and his wife. He knew a man once, a faithful, devoted,
gentle struggler with the world, whom a sudden insanity had led to the butchery of his wife
and three little boys. They found him tittering among his mangled dead, and calling them pet
names, telling the shattered red things that he had wrought God's will upon them.

What if this should come to him! Better to end all the danger of that by removing himself from
the reach of mania or shame. It would be the final proof of his love for his flock. And they
would not think bitterly of him. All things are forgiven the dead. They would miss him and
remember the best of him.

They would appreciate what they had cost him, too, when they no longer had him to draw on.
He felt very sorry for himself. " Judy( she' s my wife) she tell me she heah Miss Anne when she axed
ole missis mout she wear mo' nin' fur' im.

I don' know how dat is; but when we buried' im nex' day, she wuz de one whar walked arfter de coffin,
holdin' ole marster, an' ole missis she walked next to' em.""

Well,
we buried Marse Chan dyar in de ole grabeyard, wid de fleg wrapped
roun'' im, an' he face lookin' like it did dat mawnin' down in de
low groun' s, wid de new sun shinin' on it so peaceful.

Dat warn' so mighty long,' cause ole marster he died dat fall, when dey
wuz fallerin deserted' fur wheat-- I had jes' married Judy den-- an'
ole missis she warn' long behine him.

We buried her by him next summer.

Miss Anne she went in de hospitals toreckly arfter ole missis died; an' jes' fo' Richmond fell she come
home sick wid de fever. Yo' nuvver would' a' knowed her fur de same ole Miss Anne. She wuz light

Judy she sut' n' y did nuss her faithful.

But she nuvver got no betterment! De fever an' Marse Chan' s bein' kilt hed done strain her, an' she

So we buried Miss Anne right by Marse Chan, in place whar ole missis hed

de ole grabeyard at home."

An' will yo' please tell me, marster? Dey tells me dat de Bible sey dyar won' be marryin' nor
givin' in marriage in heaven, but I don' b' lieve it signifies dat-- does
yo'?"

I gave him the comfort of my earnest belief in some other interpretation,
together with several spare" eighteen- pences," as he called them,
for which he seemed humbly grateful.

And as I rode away I heard him calling across the fence to his wife,
who was standing in the door of a small whitewashed cabin, near which
we had been standing for some time:" Judy, have Marse Chan' s dawg
got home?"

MR. BIXBY' S CHRISTMAS VISITOR.
BY CHARLES S. GAGE.

Appleton' s Journal, December 30, 1871.

At the head of the first flight of stairs, and on opposite sides
of the landing, were the respective rooms of Mr. Bixby and Mr. Bangs.

The house in which they lived stood in a quiet and retired street
on the lower and western side of New York, a locality which was once
inhabited by fashionable families, afterward by old- fashioned families,
and at the time of our story by the keepers of boarding- houses for
single men.

Mr. Henry Bixby and Mr. Alfred Bangs were single men-- Mr. Bangs, the
wine- merchant, because he liked wine and song so well that he never
had leisure to think of women, because he was fat, because he was
red in the face, and, if more reasons are necessary, because his fingers
were chubby and short.

For twenty years, day by day, Mr. Bangs had been absorbed in business.
For twenty years, night after night, it had been his custom to in years
as the opposite lodger was Mr. Bixby, known to his few friends as a genial,
and untied the package. Just then there came a knock at his door,
and, before he had determined whether or not he should pair of colored
philosopher and poet, to the public as the literary critic of one
of the great daily papers.

He might have been thirty- five years of age, but, as he had lived more
for others than for himself, as he had made a study and not a pleasure
of life, his gray eyes and the other features of his face suggested
to whoever met him a longer past. There was something about him that caused
men to wonder, not what he was, but what he had been.

For ten years Mr. Bangs and Mr. Bixby had been inmates of the house together. Mr. Bangs had been there longer.
The present landlady had received as a legacy from her predecessor, who did not care to take
him away, Mr. Bangs. As she said, she made a present of Bangs. Long
as they had known each other, the two lodgers were only acquaintances.
Sometimes, on a Sunday afternoon, they would walk out in company,
stroll down to the Battery, and there smoke you in!"

Mr. Bixby never in his life more their cigars and watch the ships, but
beyond this point of sociability, which neither enjoyed, there was
nothing more.

Never had Bixby read Bangs
any poem he had made, nor did ever Bangs invite Bixby to meet his
convivial friends she of an evening to play whist or to partake of
his mulled ale.

In fact, Mr. Bixby had been often and with great enthusiasm voted
an unsocial fellow by the cronies of Mr. Bangs, but he rose somewhat
in their estimation when they were informed that he had consented
to exchange rooms with their host."

He isn' t such a grouty fellow, after all," said Bangs." I told him that
we were too near the street, and that some one had been complaining
to the landlady of our singing.

He didn' t even stop to think, but agreed to do it at once. He thought
the light would be better here. Now, fellows, I call that doing the
fair thing." And the speech of Mr. Bangs was applauded. It was the
morning of the day before Christmas that the change was effected.

In the closet where had been the bottles, the decanters, glasses,
and pickle- jars of the late occupant, Mr. Bixby had arranged shelves,
and filled them with his books.

Over
the mantel, from which Mr. Bangs had taken away a colored print of
a bull- dog in an overcoat, Mr. Bixby hung a fine engraving of the
Madonna, and on the mantel itself he had placed his clock.

It was a small French clock under a crystal, so that its rapidly- swinging
pendulum could be easily seen. All bachelors, however negligent of their
surroundings, have some one hobby among articles of furniture.

It may be an easy- chair, or a book- case entertain his friends at
his apartment in not a very quiet way.

He was so happy, and bulbous, and jolly, that he had never thought
of marriage. Yet he might easily have been mistaken by the casual
observer for a family man. He wore a white vest when it wasn' t too cold;
his linen was painfully plain.

There was not a sign of jewelry about him. He wore low shoes, which
he tied with a ribbon. This was Mr. Bangs. Not quite so old, or
a chandelier-- there is one thing that must be the best of its kind.

There could be no doubt, from the care with which Mr. Bixby placed
his clock in its position, and from time to time compared it with his
watch, that this was his hobby. It had the three requisites which
he demanded in a clock.

It kept correct time without failing, its pendulum swung rapidly, and was
plainly visible. Time past was the happiness of Mr. Bixby, and this clock
told him continually that all was being done that could be done to
induce the hours of every day to go over to the majority.

He depended upon this clock. He was surer of its mechanism than of that of
his own heart. What with hanging his pictures and arranging his furniture,
and with many other little things which had to be done, Mr. Bixby
was busily employed all day.

But the task was not an unpleasant one.

His heart was in the work, for there was hardly an object in the room not nearly associated
with some event in his past life. After carefully brushing the dust from an
old writing- desk, which had evidently once belonged to a lady, he
placed it upon the rug in front of the fire.

Only on Christmas- eves was this desk opened." It is curious," thought Mr. Bixby," that I should have
moved this day, of all days in the year!" Often in his work he thought not yet time, and, moreover,
he was continually interrupted. First, there came some one to his door with"
Two dozen Congress- water for Mr. Bangs;" then one with"

Mr. Bangs' s boots," and another to tell Mr. Bangs that" the pup
was big enough to take away."

Finally, came Bangs himself, to complain of like interruptions, and
to bid him good- by." Here is some manuscript a boy left for you.

You will have to attend both doors now. I am off to spend Christmas.
We are going to have a Tom- and- Jerry party in Jersey. You know--"'
The Tom- and- Jerry days have come, the happiest in the year!'"

       Good rendering, eh? That isn' t all:"' I only wish to live till the
juleps come again!'" And Mr. Bangs laughed uproariously, even after
he had said," Good- by," and shut the door behind him."

What a personification of Bacchus!" thought Mr. Bixby--"' Ever laughing,
ever young.'" He will be young as long as he populate, but I am
afraid that won' t be long.

If ever there was a in immediate danger of apoplexy, Bangs is that
man."

It was after dinner when Mr. Bixby lighted his drop- light and sat
down before the fire.

He pushed an ottoman in front of him, on which to rest his feet, which
he had comfortably encased in his slippers. But the shadows in his
new room did not please him.

He could hardly see the clock on the mantel.

The Madonna above was completely in the shade. So he lighted the chandelier
above and sat down again, hoping that no friend, either of his own or of
Mr. Bangs, would interrupt him. The desk was open at his feet. The package
of letters lay near him on the table. He placed his hand upon them,
but let it rest there.

The hour had not quite arrived when he would read them.

He
fell again into the reveries of the day. He lingered over the thoughts
of his better life ere he opened the packet which told of its end.

For the last ten years he had labored without ambition, and had been successful. His name was well known
as a journalist, and his salary was ample. Before that time he had striven
ambitiously, but fruitlessly, patiently, but as in a quicksand, until,
on a day, he had none to strive for but himself, and success had
come. Since noon, seven hours and twenty- nine minutes, said the clock
before him.

His anniversary was near. Mr. Bixby drew the letters near spectacles,
but these, as they caught and reflected the light, were brighter
and more startling than any eyes could have been.

He was dressed in a long surtout, which he wore closely buttoned,
high dickey, and high black- silk stock, which covered his throat
to his chin.

His iron- gray hair was brushed somewhat pompously backward over his forehead,
and his whole effect was that of a gentleman of the generation which
wore bell- crowned hats and carried enormous canes with tassels.

But what attracted Mr. Bixby' s particular attention were the wrinkles
of his face.

These were in all places where wrinkles should not be.

One ran straight through the centre of his forehead, continuing the
line of the nose upward to the hair.

Two others, starting from the bridge of the nose, ran diagonally down
to the nostrils.

He was close- shaven, and
his lips were straight and thin.

These peculiarities of his visitor Mr. Bixby had barely time to mark
when the gentleman said:" Ah, Mr. Bangs, I am glad to find desired
to be alone, and yet there was something in this old man which so
attracted him that he could not correct his mistake.

He felt a sudden fascination and desire to know more of him. Bangs
was away and could not be seen.

The gentleman could not be very well acquainted with Bangs, very
probably never had seen him, or he would not have made such an error.

But nothing but the influence which seemed to proceed from his visitor
could have induced Mr. Bixby to answer as he did."

Thank you, sir. Pray, take this chair." As he said this, he arose
and wheeled an easy- chair to the other side of the table.

The elderly gentleman sat down." You have a very cheerful apartment
here, Mr. Bangs."" Yes. I always like to be comfortable."" Of course,"
said the elderly gentleman."

Will you remove your overcoat, sir?" asked Mr. Bixby, and immediately
repented it." Oh, no, I shall stop but a moment."

There was an interval of silence.

A block of coal broke open in the grate and fell apart. A jet of gas
burst forth and burned, then sputtered and went out.

Mr. Bixby wondered on what business he had come, and why he did not
open the subject at once, if he was only intending to stop a moment."

It is very disagreeable weather out," said the man with the pompous forelock, interrupting his reflections."
Snowing?" asked Bixby." No-- sleet."" Very unpleasant to have far to
go such a night," suggested Bixby, who could think of nothing better
to say."

Not at all," responded the old gentleman, authoritatively. Bixby was silent again. The old gentleman,
leaning of stopping to take from the desk an old packet of letters, and
reading them once more. But it was with his elbow on the table, began
again."

You like to live well, Mr. Bangs?"" I try to," answered Mr. Bixby." Yes.""
This must be some relative of Bangs come to deliver him a lecture
on his course of life.

Why don' t he broach his advice at once?" thought Mr. Bixby. The visitor
here pulled a glove from his right hand, ran his not so much of a man
as your grandfather."" Was he not?" asked Mr. Bixby, musingly. He
was thinking how old the grandfather of his friend Bangs must have
been."

No," continued the elderly gentleman say," Come in," the door opened, and an elderly gentleman stepped
into the apartment. Quietly he came in. There was no sound attending his entrance
except the knock. Mr. Bixby, looking up, saw a man of more than ordinary
height, with countenance rigid and puritanical in expression, as
though the mind which had formed it was one influenced more by justice
than mercy.

His eyes were concealed by a;" but even his judgment I never considered
equal to that of your great- grandfather."" Here is, indeed, a friend--
a friend of the family.

Why is Mr. Bangs away?" thought Mr. fingers through
his hair, and then, in a more business- like tone, spoke again:" Although
a stranger to you personally, Mr. Bangs, I have always taken a great
interest in your family.

Mr. Bangs, I knew your father."" Indeed! I never heard him speak--""
No, I dare say; it was near the end of his life. I was near by, and rendered
him some assistance, when he died suddenly of apoplexy.

He was Bixby, and he bent his head a little, and looked under the drop-
light, to get a view of his visitor.

He saw only
the reflection on his spectacles, and drew back suddenly, for fear of
being detected." You like a good song, I have heard, Mr. Bangs," came from
the other side of the table." Have you any favorite?" Mr. Bixby did not understand
this at all. The question puzzled him. Should he as Bangs fall in the estimation
of some relative if he admitted the fact? Or did his visitor intend
to sing?

However, he felt compelled to be frank, so he said:" Oh, yes; I like
a good song.

Some of the Scotch ballads please me most. There is' The Land o' the Leal.'"" A very
fine song, sir. A very fine song. It is a credit to any man to like
that song." The old gentleman was excited. Mr. Bixby was just congratulating
himself on having given Bangs a lift, when his thoughts were turned into
an altogether new channel by the following remark:" It was my impression,
however, that your taste ran rather in the way of drinking- songs. I should
have thought now you would have said,' The Coal- Black Wine.'" There
was something in the tone with which this was uttered that made Mr.
Bixby shudder.

It ran through his mind that this man was some enemy of Bangs-- that
he was dangerous.

Startled by this sudden suspicion, tremblingly he again peered under
the shade.

The wrinkle in the line of the frontal suture was more deeply indented. The
light on the spectacles was brighter than ever."

Mr. Bangs, I called on
your opposite neighbor, Mr. Bixby, to- night.

I knocked on the door, but he was away.""

Yes," said Mr. Bixby, somewhat confused.

He wished that Bangs had stayed at home, and determined to end the
interview as soon as possible."

Yes. I am sorry. I had a positive appointment
with him. I am a great friend of his.""

Does he
know you?""

Oh, no; we have never met
personally that he remembers. I am an old friend of the family.
 I have on--whew!--unusually thick socks to-day.

Clay Kittredge, Rudd's employer, valued him, secretly, as a man who brought in customers and
sold them goods. But he never mentioned this to his clerk lest Rudd be tempted to the sin of
vanity, and incidentally to demanding an increase in that salary which had remained the same
since he had been promoted from delivery-boy.

Kittredge found that Rudd kept his secrets as he kept everybody's else. Professing church member
as he was, Rudd earnestly palmed off shopworn stock for fresh invoices, declared that the obsolete
Piccadillies which Kittredge had snapped up from a bankrupt sale were worn on all the best
feet on Fifth Avenoo, and blandly substituted "just as good" for advertised wares that Kittredge
did not carry.

Besides, when no customer was in the shop he spent the time at the back window, doctoring tags--as
the King of France negotiated the hill--by marking up prices, then marking them down.

But when he took his hat from the peg and set it on his head, he put on his private conscience.
Whatever else he did, he never lied or cheated to his own advantage.

And so everybody in town liked William Rudd, and nobody admired him. He was treated with the
affectionate contempt of an old family servant. But he had his ambitions and great ones, ambitions
that reached past himself into the future of another generation. He felt the thrill that stirs
the acorn, fallen into the ground and hidden there, but destined to father an oak. His was
the ambition beyond ambition that glorifies the seed in the loam and ennobles the roots of
trees thrusting themselves downward and gripping obscurity in order that trunks and branches,
flowers and fruits, pods and cones, may flourish aloft.

Eventually old Clay Kittredge died, and the son chopped the "Jr." curlicue from the end of
his name and began a new régime. The old Kittredge had sought only his own aggrandizement,
and his son was his son. The new Clay Kittredge had gone to public school with Rudd and they
continued to be "Clay" and "Will" to each other; no one would ever have called Rudd by so demonstrative
a name as "Bill."

When Clay second stepped into his father's boots--and shoes--he began to enlarge the business,
hoping to efface his father's achievements by his own. The shop gradually expanded to a department
store for covering all portions of the anatomy and supplying inner wants as well.

Rudd was so overjoyed at not being uprooted and flung aside to die that he never observed the
shrewd irony of Kittredge's phrase, "You may remain, Will, with no reduction of salary."

To have lost his humble position would have frustrated his dream, for he was doing his best
to build for himself and for Her a home where they could fulfil their destinies. He cherished
no hope, hardly even a desire, to be a great or rich man himself. He was one of the nest-weavers,
the cave-burrowers, the home-makers, who prepare the way for the greater than themselves who
shall spring from themselves.

He was of those who become the unknown fathers of great men. And so, on a salary that would
have meant penury to a man of self-seeking tastes, he managed to save always the major part
of his earning. At the bank he was a modest but regular visitor to the receiving-teller, and
almost a total stranger to the paying-teller.

His wildest dissipation being a second pipeful of tobacco before he went to bed--or "retired,"
as he would more gently have said it--he eventually heaped up enough money and courage to ask
Martha Kellogg to marry him. Martha, who was the plainest woman in plain Hillsdale, accepted
William, and they were made one by the parson. The wedding was accounted "plain" even in Hillsdale.

The groomy bridegroom and the unbridy bride spent together all the time that Rudd could spare
from the store. He bought for her a little frame house with a porch about as big as an upper
berth, a patch of grass with a path through it to the back door, some hollyhocks of startling
color, and a highly unimportant woodshed. It spelled HOME to them, and they were as happy as
people usually are. He did all he could to please her. At her desire he even gave up his pipe
without missing it--much.

Mrs. Martha Rudd was an ambitious woman, or at least restless and discontented. Having escaped
her supreme horror, that of being an old maid, she began to grow ambitious for her husband.
She nagged him for a while about his plodding ways, the things that satisfied him, the salary
he endured. But it did no good. Will Rudd was never meant to put boots and spurs on his own
feet and splash around in gore. He was for carpet slippers, round-toed shoes, and on wet days,
rubbers; on slushy days he even descended to what he called "ar'tics."

Not understanding the true majesty of her husband's long-distance dreams, and baffled by his
unresponse to her ambitions for him, Martha grew ambitious for the child that was coming. She
grew frantically, fantastically ambitious. Here was something William Rudd could respond to.
He could be ambitious as Cæsar--but not for himself. He was a groundling, but his son should climb.

Husband and wife spent evenings and evenings debating the future of the child. They never agreed
on the name--or the alternative names. For it is advisable to have two ready for any emergency.
But the future was rosy. They were unanimous on that--President of the United States, mebbe;
or at least the President's wife.

Mrs. Rudd, who occasionally read the continued stories in the evening paper, had happened on
a hero named "Eric." She favored that name--or Gwendolynne (with a "y"), as the case might
be. In any event, the child's future was so glowing that it warmed Mrs. Rudd to asking one
evening, forgetful of her earlier edict:

"Why don't you smoke your pipe any more, Will?"

"I'd kind o' got out of the habit, Marthy," he said, and added, hastily, "but I guess I'll
git back in."

Thereafter they sat of evenings by the lamp, he smoking, she sewing things--holding them up
now and then for him to see. They looked almost too small to be convincing, until he brought
home from the store a pair of shoes--"the smallest size made, Marthy, too small for some of
the dolls you see over at Bostwick's."

It was the golden period of his life. Rudd never sold shoes so well. People could hardly resist
his high spirits. Anticipation is a great thing--it is all that some people get.

To be a successful shoe clerk one must acquire the patience of Job without his gift of complaint,
and Rudd was thoroughly schooled. So he waited with a hope-lit serenity the preamble to the
arrival of his--her--their child.

And then fate, which had previously been content with denying him comforts and keeping him
from luxuries, dealt him a blow in the face, smote him on his patient mouth. The doctor told
him that the little body of his son had been born still. After that it was rather a stupor
of despair than courage that carried him through the vain struggle for life of the worn-out
housewife who became only almost a mother. It seemed merely the logical completion of the world's
cruelty when the doctor laid a heavy hand on his shoulder and walked out of the door, without
leaving any prescription to fill. Rudd stood like a wooden Indian, too dazed to understand
or to feel. He opened the door to the undertaker and waited outside the room, just twiddling
his fingers and wondering. His world had come to an end and he did not know what to do.

At the church, the offices of the parson, and the soprano's voice from behind the flowers,
singing "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me"--Marthy's favorite hymn--brought the tears trickling,
but he could not believe that what had happened had happened. He got through the melancholy
honor of riding in the first hack in the shabby pageant, though the town looked strange from
that window. He shivered stupidly at the first sight of the trench in the turf which was to
be the new lodging of his family. He kept as quiet as any of the group among the mounds while
the bareheaded preacher finished his part.

He was too numb with incredulity to find any expression until he heard that awfulest sound
that ever grates the human ear--the first shovelful of clods rattling on a coffin. Then he
understood--then he woke. When he saw the muddy spade spill dirt hideously above her lips,
her cheeks, her brow, and the little bundle of futile flesh she cuddled with a rigid arm to
a breast of ice--then a cry like the shriek of a falling tree split his throat and he dropped
into the grave, sprawling across the casket, beating on its denying door, and sobbing:

"You mustn't go alone, Marthy. I won't let you two go all by yourselves. It's so fur and so
dark. I can't live without you and the--the baby. Wait! Wait!"

They dragged him out, and the shovels concluded their venerable task. He was sobbing too loudly
to hear them, and the parson was holding him in his arms and patting his back and saying "'Shh!
'Shh!" as if he were a child afraid of the dark.

The sparse company that had gathered to pay the last devoir to the unimportant woman in the
box in the ditch felt, most of all, amazement at such an unexpected outburst from so expectable
a man as William Rudd. There was much talk about it as the horses galloped home, much talk
in every carriage except his and the one that had been hers.

Up to this, the neighbors had taken the whole affair with that splendid philosophy neighbors
apply to other people's woes. Mrs. Budd Granger had said to Mrs. Ad. Peck when they met in
Bostwick's dry-goods store, at the linen counter:

"Too bad about Martha Rudd, isn't it? Plain little body, but nice. Meant well. Went to church
regular. Yes, it's too bad. I don't think they ought to put off the strawb'ry fest'val, though,
just for that, do you? Never would be any fun if we stopped for every funeral, would there?
Besides, the strawb'ry fest'val's for charity, isn't it?"

The strawberry festival was not put off and the town paper said that "a pleasant time was had
by all." Most of the talk was about Will Rudd. The quiet shoe clerk had provided the town with
an alarm, an astonishment. He was most astounded of all. As he rode back to the frame house
in the swaying carriage he absolutely could not believe that such hopes, such plans, could
be shattered with such wanton, wasteful cruelty. That he should have loved, married, and begotten,
and that the new-made mother and the new-born child should be struck dead, nullified, returned
to clay--such things were too foolish, too spendthrift, to believe.

It is strange that people do not get used to death. It has come to nearly every being anybody
has ever heard of; and whom it has not yet reached, it will. Every one of the two billions
of us on earth to-day expects it to come to him, and (if he have them) to his son, his daughter,
his man-servant, his maid-servant, his ox, his ass, the stranger within his gates, the weeds
by the road. As, Hydraulica go, Organes goyng by water.& c. Of this Feat,( called commonly

 Rudd and his pipe were Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday on the
desert island of loneliness. They stared out to sea; and imagined.

Remembering how Martha and he used to dream about the child, in the tobacco twilight, and how
they planned his future, Rudd's soul learned to follow the pipe smoke out from the porch, over
the fence and to disappear beyond the horizons of the town and the sharp definition of the
graveyard fence. He became addicted to dreams, habituated to dealing in futurities that could
never come to pass.

Being his only luxury on earth, by and by they became his necessities, realities more concrete
than the shoes he sold or the board walk he plodded to and from his store.

One Sunday Rudd was present at church when Mr. and Mrs. Budd Granger brought their fourth baby
forward to be christened. The infant bawled and choked and kicked its safety-pins loose. Rudd
was sure that Eric never would have misbehaved like that. Yet Eric had been denied the sacred rite.

This reminded Rudd how many learned theologians had proved by rigid logic that unbaptized babies
are damned forever. He spent days of horror at the frightful possibility, and nights of infernal
travel across gridirons where babies flung their blistered hands in vain appeal to far-off
mothers. He could not get it from his mind until, one evening, his pipe persuaded him to erect
a font in the temple of his imagination.

He mused through all the ritual, and the little frame house seemed to thrill as the vague preacher
enounced the sonorous phrase:

"I baptize thee Eric--in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."

Marthy was there, too, of course, but it was the father that held the baby. And the child did
not wince when the pastor's fingers moistened the tiny brow. He just clasped a geranium-petal
hand round Rudd's thumb and stared at the sacrament with eyes of more than mortal understanding.

The very next day Mrs. Ad. Peck walked into the store, proud as a peahen. She wanted shoes
for her baby. The soles of the old pair were intact, but the stubby toes were protruding.

"He crawls all over the house, Mr. Rudd! And he cut his first tooth to-day, too. Just look
at it. Ain't it a beauty?"

In her insensate conceit she pried the child's mouth apart as if he were a pony, to disclose
the minute peak of ivory. It was nothing to make such a fuss over, Rudd thought, though he
praised it as if it were a snow-capped Fuji-yama.

That night Eric cut two teeth. And Marthy nearly laughed her head off.

Rudd did not talk aloud to the family he had revened from the grave. He had no occult persuasions.
He just sat in his rocker and smoked hard and imagined hard. He imagined the lives of his family
not only as they might have been, but as they ought to have been. He was like a spectator at
a play, mingling belief and make-belief inextricably, knowing it all untrue, yet weeping, laughing,
thrilling as if it were the very image of fact.

All mothers and some fathers have a sad little calendar in their hearts' cupboards where they
keep track of the things that might have been. "October fifth," they muse. "Why, it's Ned's
birthday! He'd have been twenty-one to-day if he'd lived. He'd have voted this year. December
twenty-third? Alice would have been coming home from boarding-school to-day if--July fourth?
Humph! How Harry loved the fireworks! But he'd be a Senator now and invited to his home town
to make a speech in the park to-day if--" If! If!

Everybody must keep some such if-almanac, some such diary of prayers denied. That was all Rudd
did; only he wrote it up every evening. He would take from the lavender where he kept them
the little things Martha had sewed for the child and the little shoes he had bought. The warm
body had never wriggled and laughed in the tiny trousseau, the little shoes had never housed
pink toes, but they helped him to pretend until they became to him things outgrown by a living,
growing child. He cherished them as all parents cherish the first shoes and the first linens
and woolens of their young.

Marthy and Eric Rudd lived just behind the diaphanous curtain of the pipe smoke, or in the
nooks of the twilight shadow, or in the heart of the settin'-room stove.

The frame house had no fireplace, and in its lieu he was wont to open the door of the wood-stove,
lean forward, elbows on knees, and gaze into the creamy core of the glow where his people moved
unharmed and radiant, like the three youths conversing in the fiery furnace.

In the brief period allotted them before bedtime they must needs live fast. The boy grew at
an extraordinary rate and in an extraordinary manner, for sometimes Rudd performed for him
that feat which God Himself seems not to achieve in His world; he turned back time and brought
on yesterday again, or reverted the year before last, as a reaper may pause and return to glean
some sheaf overlooked before.

For instance, Eric was already a strapping lad of seven spinning through school at a rate that
would have given brain fever to a less-gifted youngster, when, one day, Farmer Stebbins came
to the Emporium with a four-year-old chub of a son who ran in ahead of his father, kicked his
shoes in opposite directions and yelled, to the great dismay of an old maid in the "Ladies'
and Misses' Dept.":

"Hay, mister, gimme pair boots 'ith brass toes!"

The father, after a formulaic pretense of reproving the lad, explained:

"We'll have to excuse him, Rudd; it's his first pair of boots."

Rudd's heart was sore within him, and he was oppressed with guilt. He had never bought Eric
his first pair of brass-toed boots! And he a shoe clerk!

So that night Eric had to be reduced several years, brought out of school, and taken to St.
Louis. Rudd knew what an epoch-making event this was, and he wanted Eric to select from a larger
stock than the meager and out-of-date supply of Kittredge's Emporium--though this admission
was only for Rudd's own family. The thumb-screw could not have wrung it from him for the public.

There was a similar mix-up about Eric's first long trousers which Rudd likewise overlooked.
He accomplished the Irish miracle of the tight boots. Eric had worn his breeches a long while
before he put them on for the first time.

To the outer knowledge of the stranger or the neighbor, William Rudd's employer had all the
good luck that was coming to him, and all of Rudd's besides. They were antitheses at every point.

Where Rudd was without ambition, importance, family, or funds, Kittredge was the richest man
in town, the man of most impressive family, and easily the leading citizen. People began to
talk him up for Congressman, maybe for Senator. He had held all the other conspicuous offices
in his church, his bank, his county. You could hardly say that he had ever run for any office;
he had just walked up and taken it.

Yet Rudd did not envy him his record or his family. Clay Kittredge had children, real children.
The cemetery lodged none of them. Yet one of the girls or boys was always ill or in trouble
with somebody; Mrs. Kittredge was forever cautioning her children not to play with Mrs. So-and-so's
children and Mrs. So-and-so would return the compliment. The town was fairly torn up with these
nursery Guelph and Ghibelline wars.

Rudd compared the wickednesses of other people's children with the perfections of Eric. Sometimes
his evil genius whispered a bitter thought that if Eric had lived to enter the world this side
of the tobacco smoke, he, too, might have been a complete scoundrel in knee-breeches, instead
of the clean-hearted, clear-skinned, studious, truthful little gentleman of light and laughter
and love that he was. But Rudd banished the thought.

Eric was never ill, or only ill enough at times to give the parents a little of the rapture
of anxiety and of sitting by his bedside holding his hand and brushing his hair back from a
hot forehead. Eric never was impolite, or cruel to an animal, or impudent to a teacher, or
backward in a class.

And Rudd's wife differed from Kittredge's wife and wives in general--and indeed from the old
Martha herself--in staying young and growing more and more beautiful. The old Martha had been
too shy and too cognizant of the truth ever to face a camera; and Rudd often regretted that
he owned not even a bridal photograph such as the other respectable married folks of Hillsdale
had on the wall, or in a crayon enlargement on an uneasy easel. He had no likeness of Martha
except that in his heart. But thereby his fancy was unshackled and he was enabled to imagine
her sweeter, fairer, every day.

It was the boy alone that grew; the mother, having become perfect, remained stationary in charm
like the blessed Greeks in the asphodel-fields of Hades.

About the time Eric Rudd outgrew the public schools of Hillsdale and graduated from the high
school with a wonderful oration of his own writing called "Night Brings Out the Stars," Kittredge
announced that his eldest son would go to Harvard in the fall. Rudd determined that Eric should
go to Yale. He even sent for catalogues. Rudd was appalled to see how much a person had to
know before he could even get into college. And then, this nearly omniscient intellect was
called a Freshman!

The prices of rooms, of meals, of books, of extra fees, the estimated allowances for clothing
and spending-money dazed the poor shoe clerk and nearly sent Eric into business. But, fortunately,
the brier pipe came to the rescue with an unexpected legacy from an unsuspected uncle.

The four years of college life were imagined with a good deal of elision and an amount of guesswork
that would have amused a janitor. But Rudd and Martha were chiefly interested in the boy's
vacations at home, and their own trips to New Haven, and the letters of approval from the professors.

Eric had an athletic career seldom equaled since the days of Hercules. For Eric was a champion
tennis-player, hockey-player, baseballist, boxer, swimmer, runner, jumper, shot-putter. And
he was the best quoit-thrower in the New Haven town square. Rudd had rather dim notions of
some of the games, so that Eric was established both as center rush of the football team and
the cockswain in the crew.

He was also a member of all the best fraternities. He was a "Bones" man in his Freshman year,
and in his Sophomore year added the other Senior societies. And, of course, he stood at the
head of all his classes--though he never condescended to take a single red apple to a professor.

The boy's college life lasted Rudd a thousand and one evenings. It was in beautiful contrast
with the career of Kittredge's children, some of whom were forever flunking their examinations,
slipping back a year, requiring expensive tutors, acquiring bad habits, and getting into debt.
Almost the only joy Kittredge had of them was in telegraphing them money in response to their
telegrams for money--they never wrote. Their vacations either sent them scurrying on house
parties or other excursions. Or if they came home they were discontented with house and parents.
They corrected Kittredge's grammar, though his State accounted him an orator. They corrected
Mrs. Kittredge's etiquette, though Hillsdale looked up to her as a social arbitrix.

Kittredge poured a deal of his disappointment into Rudd's ear, because his hard heart was broken
and breaking anew every day, and he had to tell somebody. He knew that his old clerk would
keep it where he kept all the secrets of his business, but he never knew that Rudd still had
a child of his own, forging ahead without failure. Rudd could give comfort, for he had it to
spare, and he was empty of envy.

It was a ghastly morning when Kittredge showed Rudd a telegram saying that his eldest son,
Thomas, had thrown himself in front of a train because of the discovery that his accounts were
wrong. Kittredge had found him a place in a New York bank, but the gambling fever had seized
the young fellow. And now he was dead, in his sins, in his shame. Dives cried out to Lazarus:

"It's hell to be a father, Will. It's an awful thing to bring children into the world and try
to carry 'em through it. It's not a man's job. It's God's."

At times like these, and when Rudd heard from the tattlers, or read in the printed gossip of
the evening paper concerning the multifarious wickednesses of the children of men about the
earth, he felt almost glad that his boy had never lived upon so plague-infected a world. But
in the soothe of twilight the old pipe persuaded him to a pleasanter view of his boy, alive
and always doing the right thing, avoiding the evil.

His motto was, "Eric would have done different." He was sure of that. It was his constant conclusion.

After graduating from an imaginary Yale Eric went to an imaginary law-school in New York City--no
less. Then he was admitted to that imaginary bar where a lawyer never defends an unrighteous
cause, never loses a case, yet grows rich. And, of course, like every other American boy that
dreams or is dreamed of, in good time he had to become President.

Eric lived so exemplary a life, was so busy in virtue, so unblemished of fault, that he could
not be overlooked by the managers of the quadrennial national performance, searching with Demosthenes'
lantern for a man against whom nothing could be said. They called Eric from private life to
be headliner in their vaudeville.

Rudd had watched Kittredge clambering to his success, or rather wallowing to it through a swamp
of mud. All the wrong things Kittredge had ever done, and their name was legion, were hurled
in his path. His family scandals were dug up by the double handful and splashed in his face.
Against his opponent the same methods were used. It was like a race through a marsh; and when
Kittredge reached his goal in the Senate he was so muck-bemired, his heart had been so lacerated,
the nakedness of his past so exposed, that his laurel seemed more like a wreath of poison ivy.
And once mounted on his high post, he was an even better target than when he was on the wing.

Against Eric's blameless life the arrows of slander were like darts shot toward the sun. They
fell back upon the archers' heads. That was a lively night in the tobacco lagoon when the election
returns came in and State after State swung to Eric's column. Rudd made it as nearly unanimous
as he could without making it stupid. The solid South he left unbroken; he just brought it
over to Eric en bloc. For Eric, it seems, had devised what everybody else has looked for in
vain, a solution of the negro problem to satisfy both North and South--and the negroes. Unfortunately
the details have been lost.

Marthy was there, of course; she rode in the same hack with their boy. Some of the politicians
and the ex-President wanted to get in, but Eric said:

"My mother and father ride with me or I won't be President."

That settled 'em. Eric even wanted to ride backward, too, but Will, as his father, insisted;
and of course Eric obeyed, though he was President. And the weather was more like June than
March, no blizzards delaying trains and distributing pneumonia.

Once the administration was begun, the newspapers differed strangely in their treatment of
Eric from their attitude toward other Chief Magistrates, from Washington down. Realizing that
Eric was an honorable man trying to do the right thing by the people, no editor or cartoonist
dreamed of accusing him of an unworthy motive or an unwise act. As for the tariff labyrinth,
a matter of some trouble to certain Presidents pulled in all directions at once by warring
constituencies, Eric settled that in a jiffy. And the best of it was that everybody was satisfied,
importers and exporters; East, West, and Middle; farmers, manufacturers, lumbermen, oilmen,
painters--everybody.

And when his first term was ended the Democrats and Republicans, realizing that they had at
last found a perfectly wise and honorable ruler, nominated him by acclamation at both conventions.
The result was delightful; both parties elected their candidate.

Marthy and Will sat with Eric in the carriage at the second inaugural, too. There was an argument
again about who should ride backward. Rudd said:

"Eric, your Excellency, these here crowds came to see you, and you ought to face 'em. As your
dad I order you to set there 'side of your mother."

But Eric said, "Dad, your Majesty, the people have seen me often enough, and as the President
of these here United States I order you to set there 'side of your wife."

And of course Rudd had to do it. Folks looked very much surprised to see him and there was
quite a piece in the papers about it.

To every man his day's work and his night's dream. Will Rudd has poor nourishment of the former,
but he is richly fed of the latter. His failures and his poverty and the monotony of his existence
are public knowledge; his dream is his own triumph and the greater for being his secret.

The Fates seemed to go out of their way to be cruel to Will Rudd, but he beat them at their
own game. Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos kept Jupiter himself in awe of their shears, and the
old Norns, Urdur, Verdandi, and Skuld, ruined Wotan's power and his glory. But they could not
touch the shoe clerk. They shattered his little scheme of things to bits, but he rebuilt it
nearer to his heart's desire. He spread a sky about his private planet and ruled his little
universe like a tribal god. He, alone of all men, had won the oldest, vainest prayer that was
ever said or sung: "O God, keep the woman I love young and beautiful, and grant our child happiness
and success without sin or sorrow."

If, sometimes, the imagination of the matter-of-fact man wavers, and the ugliness of his loneliness
overwhelms him, thrusts through his dream like a hideous mountainside when an avalanche strips
the barren crags of their fleece; and if he then breaks down and calls aloud for his child
and his wife to be given back to him from Out There--these panics are also his secret. Only
the homely sitting-room of the lonely frame house knows them. He opens the door of the wood-stove
or follows his pipe smoke and rallies his courage, resumes his dream. The next morning sees
him emerge from his door and go briskly to the shop as always, whether his path is through
rain or sleet, or past the recurrent lilacs that have scattered many a purple snow across his
sidewalk since the bankruptcy of his ambitions.

He would have been proud to be the unknown father of a great man. He was not permitted to be
the father even of a humble man. Yet being denied the reality, he has taken sustenance in what
might have been, and has turned "the saddest words of tongue or pen" into something almost
sweet. If his child has missed the glories of what might have been, he has escaped the shames
that might have been, and the bruises and heartaches and remorses that must have been, that
always have been. That is the increasing consolation a bitter world offers to those who love
and have lost. That was Rudd's solace. And he made the most of it; added to it a dream. He
was a wise man.

After he paid his sorrowful debts his next slow savings went to the building of a monument
for his family. It is one of the handsomest shafts in the cemetery. If Rudd could brag of anything
he would brag of that. The inscription took a long time to write. You could tell that by its
simplicity. And you might notice the blank space left for his own name when all three shall
be together again.

Rudd is now saving a third fund against the encroaching time when he shall be too feeble to
get up from his knees after he has dropped upon them to unlace somebody's sandal. Lonely old
orphans like Rudd must provide their own pensions. There is a will, however, which bequeaths
whatever is left of his funds to an orphan home. Being a sonless father, he thinks of the sons
who have no fathers to do for them what he was so fain to do for his. It is not a large fund
for these days when rich men toss millions as tips to posterity, but it is pretty good for
a shoe clerk. And it will mean everything to some Eric that gets himself really born.

If you drop in at the Emporium and ask for a pair of shoes or boots, or slippers or rubbers,
or trees or pumps, and wait for old Rudd to get round to you, you will be served with deference,
yet with a pride of occupation that is almost priestly. And you will probably buy something,
whether you want it or not.

The old man is slightly shuffly in his gaiters. His own elastics are less resilient than once
they were. If you ask for anything on the top shelf he is a trifle slow getting the ladder
and rather ratchety in clambering up and down, and his eyes are growing so tired that he may
offer you a 6D when you ask for a 3A.

But, above all things, don't hurt his pride by offering to help him to his feet if he shows
some difficulty in rising when he has performed his genuflexion before you. Just pretend not
to notice, as he would pretend not to notice any infirmity or vanity of yours. It is his vanity
to be still the best shoe clerk in town--as he is. There is a gracious satisfiedness about
the old man that radiates contentment and makes you comfortable for the time in most uncomfortable
shoes. And as old Rudd says:

"You'll find that the best shoe is the one that pinches at first and hurts a little; in time
it will grow very comfortable and still be becoming."

That is what Rudd says, and he ought to know.

In these days he is so supremely comfortable in his old shoes that his own fellow-clerks hardly
know what to make of him. If they only understood what is going on in his private world they
would realize that Eric is about to be married--in the White House. The boy was so busy for
the country and loved his mother so that he had no time to go sparkin'.

But Marthy got after him and said: "Eric, they're goin' to make you President for the third
term. Oh, what's that old tradition got to do with it? Can't they change it? Well, you mark
my words, like as not you'll settle down and live in the White House the rest of your life.
You'd ought to have a wife, Eric, and be raisin' some childern to comfort your declining years.
What would Will and me have done without you? I'm gettin' old, Eric, and I'd kind o' like to
see how it feels to be a grandmother, before they take me out to the--"

But that was a word Rudd could never frame even in his thoughts.

Eric, being a mighty good boy, listened to his mother, as always. And Marthy looked everywhere
for an ideal woman, and when she found one, Eric fell in love with her right away. It is not
every child that is so dutiful as that.

The marriage is to take place shortly and Rudd is very busy with the details. He will go on
to Washington, of course--of evenings. In fact, the wedding is to be in the evening, so that
he won't have to miss any time at the shop. There are so many people coming in every day and
asking for shoes, that he wouldn't dare be away.

Martha is insisting on Will's buying a dress soot for the festivities, but he is in doubt about
that. Martha, though, shall have the finest dress in the land, for she is more beautiful even
than Eric's bride, and she doesn't look a day older than she did when she was a bride herself.
A body would never guess how many years ago that was.

The White House is going to be all lit up, and a lot of big folks will be there--a couple of
kings, like as not. There will be fried chicken for dinner and ice-cream--mixed, maybe, chocolate
and vanella, and p'raps a streak of strawb'ry. And there will be enough so's everybody can
have two plates. Marthy will prob'ly bake the cake herself, if she can get that old White House
stove to working right.

Rudd has a great surprise in store for her. He's going to tell a good one on Marthy. At just
the proper moment he's going to lean over--Lord, he hopes he can keep his face straight--and
say, kind of offhand:

"Do you remember, Marthy, the time when you was makin' little baby-clothes for the President
of the United States here, and you says to me--you see, Eric, she'd made me quit smokin', herself,
but she plumb forgot all about that--and she says to me, s'she, 'Why don't you smoke your pipe
any more, Will?' she says. And I says, 'I'd kind o' got out of the habit, Marthy,' s'I, 'but
I guess I'll git back in,' s'I. I said it right off like that, 'I guess I'll git back in!'
s'I. Remember, Marthy?"

THE HAPPIEST MAN IN IOWAY

    Jes' down the road a piece, 'ith dust so deep
      It teched the bay mare's fetlocks, an' the sun
    So b'ilin' hot, the peewees dassn't peep,
      Seemed like midsummer 'fore the spring's begun!
    An' me plumb beat an' good-for-nothin'-like
      An' awful lonedsome fer a sight o' you ...
    I come to that big locus' by the pike,
      An' she was all in bloom, an' trembly, too,
    With breezes like drug-store perfumery.
      I stood up in my sturrups, with my head
    So deep in flowers they almost smothered me.
      I kind o' liked to think that I was dead ...
    An' if I hed 'a' died like that to-day,
    I'd 'a' b'en the happiest man in Ioway.

    For what's the use't o' goin' on like this?
      Your pa not 'lowin' me around the place ...
    Well, fust I knowed, I'd give' them blooms a kiss;
      They tasted like Good-Night on your white face.
    I reached my arms out wide, an' hugged 'em--say,
      I dreamp' your little heart was hammerin' me!
    I broke this branch off for a love-bo'quet;
      'F I'd b'en a giant, I'd 'a' plucked the tree!
    The blooms is kind o' dusty from the road,
      But you won't mind. So, as the feller said,
    "When this you see remember me"--I knowed
      Another poem; but I've lost my head
    From seein' you! 'Bout all that I kin say
    Is--"I'm the happiest man in Ioway."

    Well, comin' 'long the road I seen your ma
     Drive by to town--she didn't speak to me!
    An' in the farthest field I seen your pa
      At his spring-plowin', like I'd ought to be.
    But, knowin' you'd be here all by yourself,
      I hed to come; for now's our livin' chance!
    Take off yer apern, leave things on the shelf--
      Our preacher needs what th' feller calls "romance."
    'Ain't got no red-wheeled buggy; but the mare
      Will carry double, like we've trained her to.
    Jes' put a locus'-blossom in your hair
      An' let's ride straight to heaven--me an' you! [ 1] Cant.
    i. 8. This, surely, is the state of self- knowledge; these
    are the convictions to which every one is brought on, who attempts honestly
to obey the precepts of God.

Is it against reason to think that they are right, who have considered
the matter most deeply?

He is ready, with the Samaritan woman, to say to all around him," Come, see a man, which told me all things
that ever I did: is not this the Christ[ 7]?" If we have no good reason
for believing, at least we have no good reason for disbelieving.

This would be quite a sufficient answer, had we nothing else to say; but I will give another, and
that in connexion with the text; I will show you that the most unlearned Christian may have
a very real and substantial argument, an intimate token, of the truth of the Gospel, quite independent
of the authority of his parents and teachers; nay, that were all the
world, even were his teachers, to tell him that religion was a dream, still
he would have a good reason for believing it true. Have not the wisest
and holiest of men been Christians? and have not unbelievers, on
the contrary, been very generally signal instances of pride, discontent,
and profligacy?

If you ask why we are Christians, we ask in turn, Why should we not be Christians? it will be enough to remain
where we are, till you do what you never can do-- prove to us for
certain, that the Gospel is not Divine; it is enough for us to be
on the side of good men, to be under the feet of the Saints, to' go
our way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and to feed our kids
beside the shepherds' tent[ 1].'"

Again, are not the principles of unbelief certain to dissolve human society?
and is not this plain fact, candidly considered, enough to show
that unbelief cannot be a right condition of our nature? for who can
believe that we were intended to live in anarchy? This reason, I say,
is contained in the text--" I have more understanding than the aged,
because I keep Thy commandments." Of these, Elijah, who lived in
the wilderness, and the hundred prophets whom Obadiah fed by fifty in
a cave, are examples of the wanderers.

Such men, when by ridicule and sophistry, are likely to fall; they have
no root in themselves; and let them be quite sure, that should they
fall away from the faith, it will be a slight thing at the last day
to plead that subtle arguments were used against them, that they were
altogether unprepared and ignorant, and that their seducers prevailed
over them by the display of some little cleverness and human knowledge.

It happens in several ways. The Bible, then, seems to say,-- God is not a hard master to require belief,
without affording grounds for believing; only follow your own sense
of right, and you will gain from that very obedience to your Maker,
which natural conscience enjoins, a conviction of the truth and power
of that Redeemer whom a supernatural message has revealed; do but
examine your thoughts and doings; do but attempt what you know to
be God' s will, and you will most assuredly be led on into all the
truth: you will recognize the force, meaning, and awful graciousness
of the Gospel Creed; you will bear witness to the truth of one doctrine,
by your own past experience of yourselves; of another, by seeing that
it is suited to your necessity; of a third, by finding it fulfilled
upon your obeying it.

They
will laugh, they will scoff, at best they will wonder: any how what
you say is no evidence to them.

You may, if you will The, have an inward witness arising from obedience:
and though you cannot make them see it, you can see it yourselves, which is
the great thing; and it will be quite sufficient, with God' s blessing,
to keep you stedfast in the way of life.

By obeying Scripture, then, in practising humility and teachableness, it is evident we are at least in
the way to arrive at the knowledge of God.

Whereas such men as have been taught betimes to work with God their Saviour--
in ruling their hearts, and curbing their bed sinful passions, and
changing their wills-- though they are still sinners, have not within
them that treacherous enemy of the truth which misleads the judgments
of irreligious men.

You cannot convince them, because you differ from them in first principles;
it is not that they start from the same point as you, and afterwards
strike off in some wayward direction; but their course is altogether
distinct, they have no point in common with you. For instance, how often do men
mistake the characters and misconstrue the actions of others! how often
are they deceived in them! how often do the young form acquaintances injurious
to their comfort and good! how often do men embark in foolish and
ruinous schemes! how often do they squander their money, and destroy
their worldly prospects!

Useful as argument may be for converting a man, in such cases God seldom condescends to employ
it. The same thing happens also in religious inquiries.[ 3] Rom. vii.

15, 18, 22, 23. 2. Jeremiah returned for answer," Ah! A man who loves sin does not wish the Gospel
to be true, and therefore is not a fair judge of it; a mere man of the world, a selfish and covetous
man, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, is, from a sense of interest, against that Bible which
condemns him, and would account that man indeed a messenger of good tidings of peace who could prove to him
that Christ' s doctrine was not from God. Here, again, is a mystery:
but here, too, his conscience anticipates the mystery, and convicts him;
his mouth is stopped. But, while they still profess to honour, at least
they try to pervert and misinterpret Scripture, and that comes to
the same thing. He will admire and take pleasure in the holy law
of God, of which he reads in Scripture; but he will be humbled withal, as
understanding himself to be a continual transgressor against it. On
the other hand, impatient, proud, self- confident, sight obstinate
men, are generally wrong in the opinions they form of persons and
things.

The Prophets were ever ungratefully treated by the Israelites, they
were resisted, their warnings neglected, their good services forgotten.

He reads that
the heart is" deceitful above all things and desperately wicked[
4]," and that he inherits an evil nature from Adam, and that he is still
under its power, except so far as he has been renewed. Consider, moreover,
that those who try to obey God evidently gain a knowledge of themselves
at least; and this may be shown to be the first and principal step
towards knowing God.

As many of us as live in the world must expect to hear our faith despised,
and our conscientious obedience ridiculed; we must expect to be taunted
and scorned by those who find it much easier to attack another' s creed
than to state their own. He will perceive that there is much in him
which ought not to be in him. He may be taken as a representative of
the Prophets; and hence it is that he is an especial type of our
Lord and Saviour.

He reads, that" without holiness no man shall see the Lord[ 5];"
and his own love of what is true and lovely and pure, approves and
embraces the doctrine coming from God. In their sufferings they foreshadowed
His priesthood, and in their teaching His prophetical office, and in
their miracles His royal power. Conscience, however, being respected,
will become a more powerful and enlightened guide than before; it will
become more refined and hard to please; and he will understand and
perceive more clearly the distance that exists between his own conduct
and thoughts, and perfection.

They try to persuade themselves that Christ will save them, though they continue in sin; or they
wish to believe that future punishment will not last for ever; or they conceive that their good deeds
or habits, few and miserable as they are at best, will make up for the
sins of which they are too conscious. Thus was he next to David;
I do not say in dignity and privilege, for it was Elijah who was taken
up heaven, and appeared at the Transfiguration; nor in inspiration,
for to Isaiah one should assign the higher evangelical gifts; but
in typifying Him who came and wept over Jerusalem, and then was tortured
and will learn from experience the doctrine of original sin, before
he knows the actual name of it.

9. The effect of this experience will be to make him take it for granted, as an elementary truth, that he cannot
gain heaven for himself; to make him feel himself guilty before God; and to feel, moreover, that even were he admitted
into the Divine presence, yet, till his heart be( so to say) made
over again, he cannot perfectly enjoy God.

Now to this objection it maybe answered, and very satisfactorily," Is it then nothing
toward convincing us of the truth of the Gospel, that those whom
we love best and reverence most believe it? Here then, I say, he surely
possesses an evidence perfectly distinct from the authority of superiors
and teachers; like St. Paul, he is in one way not taught of men,"
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ[ 6]."

When, then, even an unlearned person thus trained-- from his own heart,
from the action of his mind upon itself, from struggles with self, from an
attempt to follow those impulses of his own nature which he feels to be
highest and noblest, from a vivid natural perception( natural, though cherished
and strengthened by prayer, natural, though unfolded and diversified
by practice, natural, though of that new and second nature which God
the Holy Ghost gives), from an innate, though supernatural perception
of the great vision of Truth which is external to him( a perception
of it, not indeed in its fulness, but in glimpses, and by fits and
seasons, and in its persuasive influences, and through a courageous
following on after it, as a man in the dark might follow after some
those who neglect them; first, because such men are teachable men;
secondly, because they are pure in heart; such shall see God, whereas
the proud provoke His anger, and the carnal are His abhorrence.

Of those who were sawn dim and distant light)-- I say, when a person thus trained from his heart, reads
the declarations and promises of the Gospel, are we to be told that he believes in them merely because
he has been bid believe in them? And of those who were stoned, none is more
famous than Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada," who was slain between
the temple and the altar[ 3]."

But to proceed. Here is a mystery; but his own actual and too bitter experience bears witness
to the truth of the Carthage declaration; he feels the mystery of iniquity
within him. As he grows older, he will understand this more and more.
He reads, that God is angry at sin, and will punish the sinner, and
that it is a hard matter, nay, an impossibility, for us to appease
His wrath.

I do not mean to say that such men necessarily reject the word of
God, as if we could dare to conclude.[ 8] Mal. iii. 29. And hence,
when our Lord came, while some thought Him Elijah, and others that all
who do not reject it are therefore sure to be not covetous, drunkards,
extortioners, and the like; for it is often a man' s interest not
openly to reject it, though it be against him; and the bulk of men
are inconsistent, and have some good feelings left, even amid their
sins and vices, which keep them from going all lengths.

This commission was given the year after Josiah began his reformation. He cannot choose but believe
in Him. 14. I do not mean that all that I have been saying will necessarily pass through his mind,
and in the same order, or that he will be conscious of it, or be able to speak of it, but that on the
whole thus he will feel. Others have but bid him look within, and pray for God' s grace to be enabled
to know himself; and the more he understands his own heart, the more
are the Gospel doctrines recommended to his reason.[ 7] John iv.
Do we not receive what they tell us in other matters, though cannot
prove the truth of their information; for instance, in matters of
art and science; why then is it irrational to believe them in religion
also?

Or, again, in the words which the Samaritans of the same city used to the woman after conversing with
Christ;" Now we believe, not because of thy saying"

When men think they know more than others, they often talk for
the sake of talking, or to show their ability( as they think), their shrewdness
and depth; and they speak lightly of the All- Holy God, to gratify their
empty self- conceit and vanity.

1. My brethren, it is always reasonable to insist upon these subjects; but
it is peculiarly so in times when a spirit of presumptuous doubting
is in many places abroad. For let us suppose a child, under God' s blessing,
profiting by his teacher' s guidance, and trying to do his duty and please
God. A little learning is a dangerous thing.( not merely on the authority
of friends and relatives)," for we have heard Him ourselves, and know
that this, I will now speak, as a specimen of all those Prophets whom
St. Paul sets before us as examples of faith, and St. James as examples
of patience. The history of Jeremiah, then, as being drawn out in Scripture
more circumstantially than that of the other Prophets, is the most
exact type of Christ among them; that is, next to David, who, of course,
was the nearest resemblance to Him of all, as a sufferer, an inspired
is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world." Like Samuel, the first
prophet, he was of the tribe of Levi, dedicated from his birth to religious
services, and favoured with the constant presence and grace of God.

If you urge how great a gift it is to be at peace with God, or of the arduousness and yet desirableness
of perfection, or the beauty of saintliness, or the dangerousness
of the world, or the blessedness of self- control, or the glory of
virginity, or the answers which God gives to prayer, or the marvellousness
and almost miraculousness of His providences, or the comfort of religion
in affliction, or the strength given you over your passions in the
Most Holy Sacrament, such persons understand you not at all.

Consider the Bible tells us to be meek, humble, single- hearted, and teachable.
Prejudice and self- conceit blind the eyes and mislead the judgment,
whatever be the subject inquired into.

For such persons then you can only pray; God alone can bring down pride,
self- conceit, an arrogant spirit, a presumptuous temper; God alone
can dissipate prejudice; God alone can overcome flesh and blood. And what,
I ask, is so frequent a cause of these many errors as wilfulness and
presumption?

Yet, let not such vain or ignorant reasoners convert you to unbelief
in great matters or little; let them not persuade you, that your faith
is built on the mere teaching of fallible men; do not you be ridiculed
out of your confidence and hope in Christ. Now, it is plain that humility
and teachableness are qualities of mind necessary for arriving at the
truth in any subject, and in religious matters as well as others. Lastly,
let me remark how dangerous their state is who are content to take the
truths of the Gospel on trust, without caring whether or not those
truths are realized in their own heart and conduct.

Now how comes this to pass?[ 5] Heb. xii. It was his privilege to
be name to his sacred office from his earliest years.

Human
knowledge, though of great power when joined to a pure and humble faith, is of no power when opposed
to it, and, after ail, for the comfort of the individual Christian,
it is of little value.[ 2] John iii. But in the latter times, the prophets
were not only feared and hated by the enemies of God, but cast out
of the vineyard. When I see a person hasty and violent, harsh and high-
minded, careless of what others feel, and disdainful of what they
think,-- when I see such a one proceeding to inquire into religious
subjects, I am sure beforehand he cannot go right-- he will not be
led into all the truth-- it is contrary to the nature of things and
the experience of the world, that he should find what he is seeking.

       I should say the same were he seeking to find out what to believe
or do in any other matter not,-- but especially in any such important
and solemn inquiry; for the fear of the Lord( humbleness, teachableness,
reverence towards Him) is the very beginning of wisdom, as Solomon
tells us; it leads us to think over things modestly and honestly,
to examine patiently, to bear doubt and uncertainty, to wait perseveringly
for an increase of light, to be slow to speak, and to be deliberate
in deciding.[ 4] Jer. xvii.

I know that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing[ 3]." The inward witness
to the truth lodged in our hearts is a match for the most learned infidel
or sceptic that ever lived: though, to tell the truth, such men are
generally very shallow and weak, as well as wicked; generally know
only little, pervert what they know, assume false principles, and
distort or suppress facts: but were they as accomplished as the very
author of evil, the humblest Christian, armed with sling and stone,
and supported by God' s unseen might, is, as far as his own faith
is concerned, a match for them.

He says," O Lord, Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed."[
6] Gal. i. 12. He is assured that Christ does not speak of Himself, but
that His word is from God John the Baptist, risen from the dead,
there were others who thought Him Jeremiah.

Here, then, are two very good reasons at first sight, why men who obey
the Scripture precepts are more likely to arrive at religious truth,
than asunder and slain with the sword, Isaiah is the chief, who,
as tradition goes, was by order of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah,
sawn asunder with a wooden saw.

Moses, for instance, was in trouble from his people all his life long, but
to the end he was their lawgiver and judge. 20. As the time approached
for the coming of the true Prophet of the Church, the Son of God, they
resembled Him in their earthly fortunes more and more; and as He was to
suffer, so did they. Lord God! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a
child." By obeying the commands of Scripture, we learn that these
commands really come from God; by trying we make proof; by doing we
come to know. And Micaiah, who was appointed the bread of affliction and
the water of affliction by an idolatrous king, is the specimen of
those who" had trial of bonds and imprisonment." But there was this
difference between the earlier and the later Prophets; the earlier
lived and died in honour among their people,-- in outward honour;
though hated and thwarted by the wicked, they were exalted to high
places, and ruled in the congregation.

Do we not see he has besides this a something in his own breast which bears
a confirming testimony to their truth? But of all the persecuted prophets
Jeremiah is the most eminent; i. e. we know more of his history,
of his imprisonments, his wanderings, and his afflictions. His own
natural sense of right and wrong tells him that peevishness, sullenness,
deceit, and self- will, are tempers and principles of which he has cause
to be ashamed, and he feels that these bad tempers and principles
are in his heart.

All the Prophets were types of the Great Prophet whose way they were preparing;
they tended towards and spoke of Christ. Wishing, then, and striving to
act up to the law of conscience, he will yet find that, with his utmost
efforts, and after his most earnest prayers, he still falls short
of what he knows to be right, and what he aims at.

Jeremiah' s ministry may be summed up in three words, good hope, labour, disappointment. Jeremiah
comes put to death by those He wept over. 10. Of Jeremiah, then teacher,
and a king. And, on the other hand, the most acute of reasoners and most
profound of thinkers, the most instructed in earthly knowledge, is
nothing, except he has also within him the presence of the Spirit
of truth.

And often it answers no purpose to dispute with such persons; for not having been trained up to obey their
conscience, to restrain their passions, and examine their hearts,
they will assent to nothing you can say; they will be questioning
and arguing about every thing; they have no common ground with you, and when
they talk of religion they are like blind persons talking of colours." Before
I formed thee... And when he goes on to read that the Son of God has
Himself come into the world in our flesh, and died upon the Cross
for us, does he not, amid the awful mysteriousness of the doctrine,
find those words fulfilled in him which that gracious Saviour uttered,"
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me"?

Consider, in the next place, that those who are trained carefully according to the precepts of Scripture,
gain an elevation, a delicacy, refinement, and sanctity of mind, which is most
necessary for judging fairly of the truth of Scripture. Moses was a
ruler, Jeremiah was an outcast: Samuel was buried in peace, John the
Baptist was beheaded.

He felt the arduousness of a prophet' s office; the firmness and intrepidity which were required to
speak the words of God. May we, then, all grow in heavenly knowledge, and,
with that end, labour to improve what is already given us, be it more
or be it less, knowing that" he that is faithful in little is faithful
also in much.," and that" to him that hath, more shall be given."


But there was a sense of grim relief that helped them all, and the bird, once safely dead,
was rapidly forgotten. After that Crosson seemed to lose his place in Irene's heart, and Drury
won all that Crosson lost, and more. Before long it was understood that Drury and Irene had
agreed to get married as soon as he could earn enough to keep them. All four parents opposed
the match; Irene's because Drury was "no 'count," and Drury's for much the same reason.

Old Boldin allowed that Irene would be added to his family, for meals and lodgin', if she married
his son; and old Straley guessed that it would be the other way round, and the Boldin boy would
come over to his house to live.

Also, Drury could get no work in Carthage. Eventually he went to Chicago to try his luck there.
Crosson seized the chance to try to get back to Irene. One Sunday he took his shot-gun out
in the wilderness and brought down a duck whose throat had so rich a glimmer that he believed
it would delight Irene. He took it to her.

She was out in her garden, and she looked at his gift with eyes so hurt by the pity of the
bird's drooping neck that they were blind to its beauty.

While Crosson stood in sheepish dismay, recognizing that Drury was present still in his absence,
the minister appeared at his elbow. It was not the wrecked career of the fowl that shocked
the pastor, but the broken Sabbath.

"It seems to me, Eddie," he said, "that it is high time you were beginning to take life seriously.
Come to church to-night and make up for your ungodliness."

Crosson consented. It was a good way of making his escape from Irene's haunted eyes.

The service that night had little influence on his heart, but a month later a revivalist came
into Carthage with a great fanfare of attack on the hosts of Lucifer. This man was an emotionalist
of irresistible fire. He reasoned less than he sang. His voice was as thrilling as a trombone,
and his words did not matter. It was his tone that made the heart resound like a smitten bell.

The revivalist struck unsuspected chords of emotion in Eddie Crosson and made him weep! But
he wept tears of a different sort from the waters of grief. His unusual tears were a tribute
to eloquence. Sonorous words and noble thoughts thrilled Eddie Crosson then as ever after.

He had loved to speak pieces at school. Whether it were Spartacus exhorting his brawny slaves
to revolt, or Daniel Webster upholding the Union now and forever, one and inseparable, he had
felt an exaltation, an exultation that enlarged him to the clouds. He loved the phrase more
than the meaning. What was well worded was well reasoned.

His passion for elocution had inclined him at first to be a lawyer, but when he visited the
county courthouse the attorneys he listened to had such dull themes to expound that he felt
no call to the law. What glory was there in pleading for the honor of an old darky chicken-thief
when everybody knew at once that he was guilty of stealing the chickens in question, or would
have been if he had known of their accessibility? What rapture was there in insisting that
a case in an Alabama court eight years before furnished an exact precedent in the matter of
a mechanic's lien in Carthage?

So Crosson chilled toward the legal profession. His father urged him to come into the Crosson
hardware emporium, but Eddie hated the silent trades. The revivalist decided him, and he began
to make his heart ready for the clerical life. His father opposed him heathenishly and would
not pay for his seminary course.

For several months Crosson waited about, becalmed in the doldrums. There was little to interest
him in town except a helpless espionage on Irene's loyalty to Drury Boldin. Her troth defied
both time and space. She went every day to the post-office to mail a heavy letter and to receive
the heavy letter she was sure to find there.

She became a sort of tender joke at the post-office, and on the street as well, for she always
read her daily letter on the way home. She would be so absorbed in the petty chronicles of
Drury's life that she would stroll into people and bump into trees, or fetch up short against
a fence. She sprained her ankle once walking off the walk. And once she marched plump into
the parson's horrified bosom.

Crosson often stood in ambush so that she would run into him. She was very soft and delicate,
and she usually had flowers pinned at her breast.

Crosson would grin as she stumbled against him; then the lovelorn girl would stare up at him
through the haze of the distance her letter had carried her to, and stammer excuses and fall
back and blush, and glide round him on her way. Crosson would laugh aloud, bravely, but afterward
he would turn and stare at her solemnly enough when she resumed her letter and strolled on
in the rosy cloud of her communion with her far-off "fellow."

One day Crosson had to run after her, because when she thought she was turning into her own
yard her absent mind led her to unlatch the gate to a pasture where a muley cow with a scandalous
temper was waiting for her with swaying head.

Irene laughed at her escape, with an unusual mirth for her. She explained it by seizing Crosson's
sleeve and exclaiming:

"Oh, Eddie, such good news from Drury you never heard! He's got a position with a jewelry-store,
the biggest in Chicago. And they put him in the designing department at ten dollars a week,
and they say he's got a future. Isn't it simply glorious?"

She held Crosson while she read the young man's hallelujahs. They sounded to Crosson like a
funeral address.

Irene's mother was even prouder of Drury's success than the daughter was. She bragged now of
the wedding she had dreaded before. Finally Irene proclaimed the glorious truth that Drury's
salary had been boosted again and they would wait no longer for wealth. He was awful busy,
and so he'd just run down for a couple of days and marry her and run back with her to Chicago
and jewelry. This arrangement ended Irene's mother's dreams of a fine wedding and relieved
the townspeople of the expense of wedding-presents.

The sudden announcement of the wedding shocked Crosson. He endured a jealousy whose intensity
surprised him in retrospect. He endured a good deal of humor, too, from village cut-ups, who
teased him because his best girl was marrying the other fellow.

Crosson felt a need of solitude and a fierce desire to kill something. He got his abandoned
gun and went hunting to wear out his wrath. He wore himself out, at least. He shot savagely
at all sorts of life. He followed one flitting, sarcastic blue-jay with a voice like a village
cut-up, all the way home without getting near enough to shoot.

He came down the long hill with the sunset, bragging to himself that he was reconciled to Irene's
marriage with anybody she'd a mind to.

He could see her from a distance, sitting on the porch alone. She was all dressed up and rocking
impatiently. Evidently the train was late again, as always. From where he was, Crosson could
see the track winding around the hills like a little metal brook. The smoke of the engine was
not yet pluming along the horizon. The train could not arrive for some minutes yet.

To prove his freedom from rancor and his emancipation from love, but really because he could
not resist the chance to have a last word with Irene, he went across lots to her father's back
yard and came round to the porch. He forgot to draw the shells from his gun.

In the sunset, with his weapon a-shoulder, he must have looked a bit wild, for Irene jumped
when he spoke to her. He sought an excuse for his visit and put at her feet the game he had
bagged--a squirrel, a rabbit, and a few birds--the last he ever shot.

The moment the dead things were there he regretted the impulse. He was reminded of his previous
quarry and its ill success. Irene was reminded, too, for she thanked him timidly and asked
if he had left any wounded birds in the field. He laughed "No" with a poor grace.

She said: "I'd better get these out of sight before Drury comes. He doesn't like to see such
things."

She lifted them distastefully and went into the house. She came out almost at once, for she
heard a train. But it was not the passenger swooping south; it was the freight trudging north.
There was only a single track then, and no block system of signals.

Irene no sooner recognized the lumbering, jostling drove of cattle-cars and flats going by
than she gasped:

"That freight ought not to be on that track--now!"

She was frozen with dread. Crosson understood, too. Then from the distance came the whistle
of the express, the long hurrah of its approach to the station. The freight engineer answered
it with short, sharp blasts of his whistle. He kept jabbing the air with its noise.

There was the grind of the brakes on the wheels. The cars tried to stop, like a mob, but the
rear cars bunted the front cars forward irresistibly. The cattle aboard lowed and bellowed.
The brakemen, quaint silhouettes against the red sky, ran along the tops of the box-cars, twisting
the brake-wheels.

Irene stumbled down the steps and dashed across the pastures toward the jutting hill that she
had so often seen the express sweep round. Crosson followed.

They came to a fence. She could not climb, she was trembling so. Crosson had to help her over.
She ran on, and as he sprawled after, he nearly discharged the gun.

He brought it along by habit as he followed Irene, who ran and ran, waving her arms as if she
would stop the express with her naked hands.

But long before they reached the tracks the express roared round the headland and plunged into
the freight. The two locomotives met and rose up and wrestled like two black bears, and fell
over. The cars were scattered and jumbled like a baby's train. They were all of wood--heated
by soft-coal stoves and lighted by coal-oil lamps.

The wreck was the usual horror, the usual chaos of wanton destruction and mysterious escape.
The engineers stuck to their engines and were involved in their ruin somewhere. The passenger-train
was crowded, and destruction showed no favoritism: old men, women, children, sheep, horses,
cows, were maimed, or killed, or left scot-free.

Some of those who were uninjured ran away. Some stood weeping. Some of the wounded began at
once to rescue others. Crosson stood gaping at the spectacle, but Irene went into the wreckage,
pawing and peering like a terrier.

She could not find what she was looking for. She would bend and stare into a face glaring under
the timbers and maundering for help, then pass on. She would turn over a twisted frame and
let it roll back. She was not a sister of charity; she was Drury Boldin's helpmeet.

She kept calling his name, "Drury--Drury--Drury!" Crosson watched her as she poised to listen
for the answer that did not come. He gaped at her in stupid fascination till a brakeman shook
him and ordered him to lend a hand. He rested his gun against a pile of ties and bowed his
shoulder to the hoisting of a beam overhanging a woman and a suckling babe.

The helpers dislodged other beams and finished the lives they had meant to save.

There were no physicians on the train. But a doctor or two from the town came out and the others
were sent for. A telegram was sent to summon a relief-train, but it could not arrive for hours.

The doctors began at the beginning, but they could do little. Their own lives were in constant
danger from tumbling wreckage, for the rescuers were playing a game of tragic jackstraws. The
least mistake brought down disaster.

As he worked, Crosson could hear Irene calling, calling, "Drury, Drury, Drury!"

He left his task to follow her, his jealousy turned into a wild sorrow for her.

At last he heard in her cry of "Drury!" a note that meant she had found him. But such a welcome
as it was for a bride to give! And such a trysting-place!

The car Drury was in had turned a somersault and cracked open across another. Its inverted
wheels on their trucks had made a bower of steel about the bridegroom. The flames from the
stove and from the oil-lamps were blooming like hell-flowers everywhere. And the wind that
fanned the blazes was blowing clouds of scalding steam from the crumpled boilers of the two
engines.

Crosson ran to Irene's side. She was trying to clamber through a trellis of iron and splintered
wood. She was stretching her hand out to Drury, where he lay unconscious, deep in the clutter.
Crosson dragged her away from a flame that swung toward her. She struck his hand aside and
thrust her body into the danger again.

Crosson, finding no water, began to shovel loose earth on the blaze with a sharp plank from
the side of a car. Finding that she could not reach her lover, Irene turned and begged Crosson
to run for help and for the doctors.

He ran, but the doctors refused to leave the work they had in hand, and the other men growled:

"Everybody's got to take their turn."

Crosson ran back to Irene with the news. Drury had just emerged from the merciful swoon of
shock to the frenzies of his splintered bones, lacerated flesh and blistered skin, and the
threat of his infernal environment.

The last exquisite fiendishness was the sight of his sweetheart as witness to his agony, her
face lighted up by the flames that were ravening toward him, her hands hungering toward him,
just beyond the stretch of his one free arm.

Crosson heard the lovers murmur to each other across that little abyss. He flung himself against
the barriers like a madman. But his hands were futile against the tangle of joists and hot steel.

Irene saw him working alone and asked him where the others were, and the doctors.

"They wouldn't come!" Crosson groaned, ashamed of their ugly sense of justice.

The girl's face took on a look of grim ferocity. She said to Crosson:

"Your gun--where is it?"

He pointed to where he had left it. It had fallen to the ground.

She ran and seized it up, and holding it awkwardly but with menace, advanced on a doctor who
toiled with sleeves rolled high, and face and beard and arms blotched with red grime.

She thrust the muzzle into his chest and spoke hoarsely:

"Doctor Lane, you come with me."

"I'm busy here," he growled, pushing the gun aside, hardly knowing what it was.

She jammed it against his heart again and cried, "Come with me or I'll kill you!"

He followed her, wondering rather than fearing, and she swept a group of men with the weapon,
and commanded, "You men come, too." She marched them to the spot where Drury was concealed,
and pointed to him and snarled, "Get him out!"

The men tested their strength here and there without promise of success. One group started
a heap of wheels to slewing downward and Crosson shouted to them to stop. An inch more, and
they would have buried Drury from sight or hope.

One man wormed through somehow and caught Drury by the hand, but the first tug brought from
him such a wail of anguish that the man fell back. He could not budge the body clamped with
steel. He could only wrench it. So he came away.

"There's nothing for me to do, Reny," the doctor faltered, and, choked with pity for her and
her lover and the helplessness of mankind, he turned away, and she let him go. The gun fell
to the ground.

The other men left the place. One of them said that the wrecking-crew would be along with a
derrick in a few hours.

"A few hours!" Irene whimpered.

She leaned against the lattice that kept her from the bridegroom and tried to tell him to be
brave. But he had heard his sentence, and with his last hope went what little courage he had
ever had.

He began to plead and protest and weep. He gave voice to all the voices of pain, the myriad
voices from every tormented particle of him.

Irene knelt down and twisted through the crevice to where she could hold his hand. But he snatched
it away, babbling: "Don't touch me! Don't touch me!"

Crosson stayed near, dreading lest Irene's skirts should catch fire. Twice he beat them out
with his hands. She had not noticed that they were aflame. She was murmuring love-words of
odious vanity to one who almost forgot her existence, centered in the glowing sphere of his
own hell.

Drury rolled and panted and gibbered, cursed even, with lips more used to gentle words and
prayers. He prayed, too, but with sacrilege:

"O Lord, spare me this. O God, have a little mercy. Send rain, send help, lift this mountain
from me just till I can breathe. O God, if You have any mercy in Your heart--but no, no--no,
no, You let Your own Son hang on the cross, didn't You? He asked You why You had deserted Him,
and You didn't answer, did You?"

Crosson looked up to see a thunderbolt split the dark sky, but the stars were agleam now, twinkling
about the moon's serenity.

Irene put her fingers across Drury's lips to hush his blasphemy. She tore her face with her
nails, and tried for his sake to stifle the sobs that smote through her.

By and by Drury's voice grew hoarse, and he whispered. She bent close and heard. She called
to Crosson:

"Run get the doctor to give him something--some morphine or something--quick. Every second
is agony for my poor boy."

Crosson ran to the doctor. He stood among writhing bodies and shook his head dismally. He was
saying as Crosson came up:

"I'm sorry, I'm awful sorry, folks, but the last grain of morphine is gone. The drug-stores
haven't got any more. We've telegraphed to the next town. You'll just have to stand it."

Crosson went back slowly with that heavy burden of news. He whispered it to Irene, but Drury
heard him, and a shriek of despair went from him like a flash of fire. New blazes sprang up
with an impish merriment. I asked whether the Armenians had killed any Government official, or any
Turks or Kurds in Diarbekir.

He replied that they had killed no one, be but that a few days after come the arrival of the Vali

Dikrân and demanded from him the names of his associates., and the
Commandant of Gendarmerie, Rushdi request, imprisoned the habit ecclesiastics

I often talked to him, and I asked him to tell me his story. He said
that one day, whilst he was sitting in his house, a police agent knocked

He had a knife with him, and when they the aggravated the torture so that he
could endure it no longer, he asked became of his return he would tell them
he matter.

With the office and there fainted.

His thoughts had not needed the time their telling requires. They gave him back his scenes
in pictures, not in words; in heartaches and heartbreaks and terrors and longings, not in limping
syllables that mock the vision with their ineptitude.

He felt anew what he had felt and seen, and he could not give any verve to the peroration of
his sermon. He could not even change it. It had been effective when he had preached it previously.
But now he parroted with unconscious irony the phrases he had once so admired. He came to the
last word. Nothing, nothing."

His congregation felt a lack of warmth in his tone. His hand fell limply on the Bible and the
sermon was done. The only stir was one of relief at its conclusion.

He gave out the final hymn, and he sat through it while the people dragged it to the end. He
gave forth the benediction "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,"
and he made short work of the dawdlers who waited to exchange stupidities with him. He took
refuge from his congregation in his study, locked the door, and gave himself up to meditation.

Somehow pain had suddenly come to mean more to him than it had yet meant. He had known it,
groaned under it, lived it down, and let it go. He had felt sorry for other people and got
rid of their woes as best as he could with the trite expressions in use, and had forgotten
whether they were hushed by health or by death.

And so he had let the old-fashioned hell go by with other dogmas out of style. He had fashioned
a new Hades to frighten people with, that they might not find sin too attractive and imperilous.

Now he was suddenly convinced that if there must be hell, it must be such as Dante set to rhyme
and the old hard-shell preachers preached: a region where flames sear and demons pluck at the
frantic nerves, playing upon them fiendish tunes.

Yet he could not reconcile that hell with the God that made the lilac-bush whose purple clusters
shook perfume and little flowers against his window-sill, while the old locust in rivalry bent
down and flaunted against the lilacs its pendants of ivory grace and heavenly fragrance.

Against that torment of beauty came glimpses of Drury and Irene in the lurid cavern under the
wreck. Beyond those delicate blossoms he imagined the battle-fields of Europe and the ruined
vessels where hurt souls writhed in multitudes.

He could not be satisfied with any theory of the world. He could not find that pain was punishment
here, or see how it could follow the soul after the soul had left behind it the fleshly instrument
of torture. The why of it escaped his reason utterly; for Drury had been good, and he had come
upon an honorable errand when he fell into the pit.

Doctor Crosson stood at his window and begged the placid sky for information. He looked through
the lilacs and the locusts and all the green wilderness where beauty beat and throbbed like
a heart in bliss. It was the Sabbath, and he was not sure. But he was sure of a melting tenderness
in his heart for Irene Straley, and he felt that her power to feel sorry for her lover--sorry
enough to defy all the laws in his behalf--was a wonderful power. He longed for her sympathy.

By and by he began to feel a pain, the pain of Drury Boldin. He was glad. He groaned. "I hurt!
I hope that I may hurt terribly."

Suddenly it seemed that he actually was Drury Boldin in the throes of every fierce and spasmic
thrill. Again he most vividly was Irene Straley watching her lover till she could not endure
his torture or her own, and with one desperate challenge sent him back to the mystery whence
he came.

Doctor Crosson, when he came back to himself, could not solve that mystery or any mystery.
He knew one reality, that it hurts to be alive; that everybody is always hurting, and that
human heart must help human heart as best it can. Pain is the one inescapable fact; the rest
is theory.... He prayed with a deeper fervor than he had ever known:

"God give me pain, that I may understand, that I may understand!"

THE BEAUTY AND THE FOOL

There was once a beautiful woman, and she lived in a small town, though people said that she
belonged rather in a great city, where her gifts would bring her glory, riches, and a brilliant
marriage. In repose, she was superb; in motion, quite perfectly beautiful of form and carriage,
with all the suave rhythms of a beautiful being.

Her beauty was her sole opulence; the boast of her friends; the confession of her enemies;
the magnet of many lovers; the village's one statue. She had an ordinary heart, quite commonplace
brains, but beauty that lined the pathway where she walked with eyes of admiration and delight.

In her town, among her suitors, was one that was a Fool--not a remarkable fool; a simple, commonplace
fool of the sort that abounds even in villages. He was foolish enough to love the Beauty so
completely that when he made sure that she would not love him he could not endure to remain
in the village, but went far away in the West to get the torment of her beauty out of his sight.
The other suitors, who were wiser than he, when they found that she was not for them, gave
her up with mild regret as one gives up a fabulous dream, saying: "There was no hope for us,
anyway. If the Fool had stayed at home he would have been saved from the sight of her, for
she is going East, where there are great fortunes for the very beautiful."

And this she made ready to do, since the praise she had received had bred ambition in her--a
reasonable and right ambition, for why should a light be hidden under a bushel when it might
be set up on high to illumine a wide garden? Besides, she had not learned to love any of the
unimportant men who loved her important beauty, yet promised it nothing more than a bushel
to hide itself in.

So she made ready to take her beauty to the larger market-place. But the night before she was
to leave the village her father's house took fire mysteriously. The servant, rushing to her
door to waken her, died, suffocated there before she could cry out. The Beauty woke to find
her bed in flames. She rose with hair and gown ablaze, and, agonizing to a window, leaped blindly
out upon the pavement. There the neighbors quenched the fire and saved her life--but nothing more.

Thereafter she was a cripple, and her vaunted beauty was dead; it had gone into the flames,
and she had only the ashes of it on her seared face. Now she had only pity where she had had
envy and adulation. Now there was a turning away of eyes when she hurried abroad on necessary
errands. Now her enemies were tenderly disposed toward her, and everybody forbore to mention
what she had been. Everybody spared her feelings and talked of other things and looked at the
floor or at the sky when she must be spoken to.

One day the Fool, having heard only that the Beauty was to leave the village, and having heard
nothing of the fire, and not having prospered where he was, returned to his old home. The first
person he saw he asked of the Beauty, and that one told him of the holocaust of her graces,
and warned him, remembering that the Fool had always spoken his thoughts without tact or discretion--warned
the Fool to disguise when he saw her the shock he must feel and make no sign that he found
her other than he left her. And the Fool promised.

When he saw her he made a pretense indeed of greeting her as before, but he was like a man
trying to look upon a fog as upon a sunrise; for the old beauty of her face did not strike
his eyes full of its own radiance. She saw the struggle of his smile and the wincing of his
soul. But she did not wince, for she was by now bitterly accustomed to this reticence and self-control.

He walked along the street with her, and looked always aside or ahead and talked of other things.
He walked with her to her own gate, and to her porch, trying to find some light thing to say
to leave her. But the cruelty of the world was like a rusty nail in his heart, and when he
put out his hand and she set in his hand what her once so exquisite fingers were now, his heart
broke in his breast; and when he lifted his eyes to what her once so triumphant face was now,
they refused to withhold their tears, and his lips could not hold back his thoughts, and he
groaned aloud:

"Oh, you were so beautiful! No one was ever so beautiful as you were then. But now--I can't
stand it! I can't stand it! I wish that I might have died for you. You were so beautiful! I
can see you now as you were when I told you good-by."

Then he was afraid for what he had said, and ashamed, and he dreaded to look at her again.
He would have dashed away, but she seized him by the sleeve, and whispered:

"How good it is to hear your words! You are the only one that has told me that I ever was beautiful
since I became what I am. Tell me, tell me how I looked when you bade me good-by!"

And he told her. Looking aside or at the sky, he told her of her face like a rose in the moonlight,
of her hair like some mist spun and woven in shadows and glamours of its own, of her long creamy
arms and her hands that a god had fashioned lovingly. He told her of her eyes and their deeps,
and their lashes and the brows above them. He told her of the strange rhythm of her musical
form when she walked or danced or leaned upon the arm of her chair.

He dared not look at her lest he lose his remembrance of them; but he heard her laughing, softly
at first, then with pride and wild triumph. And she crushed his hand in hers and kissed it,
murmuring: "God bless you! God bless you!"

For even in poverty it is sweet to know that once we were rich.

THE GHOSTLY COUNSELORS

I

In a little hall bedroom in a big city lay a little woman in a big trouble. She had taken the
room under an assumed name, and a visitor had come to her there--to little her in the big city,
from the bigger unknown.

She had taken the room as "Mrs. Emerton." The landlady, Mrs. Rotch, had had her doubts. But
then she was liberal-minded--folks had to be in that street. Still, she made it an invariable
rule that "no visitors was never allowed in rooms," a parlor being kept for the purpose up
to ten o'clock, when the landlady went to bed in it, "her having to have her sleep as well
as anybody."

But, in spite of the rules, a visitor had come to "Mrs. Emerton's" room--a very, very young
man. His only name as yet was "the Baby." She dared not give the young man his father's name,
for then people would know, and she had come to the city to keep people from knowing. She had
come to the wicked city from the sweet, wholesome country, where, according to fiction, there
is no evil, but where, according to fact, people are still people and moonlight is still madness.
In the country, love could be concealed but not its consequence.

Her coadjutor in the ceremony of summoning this little spirit from the vasty deep had not followed
her to the city where the miracle was achieved. He was poor, and his parents would have been
brokenhearted; his employer in the village would have taken away his seven-dollar-a-week job.

So the boy sent the girl to town alone, with what money he had saved up and what little he
could borrow; and he stayed in the village to earn more.

The girl's name was Lightfoot--Hilda Lightfoot--a curiously prophetic name for her progress
in the primrose path, though she had gone heavy-footed enough afterward. And now she could
hardly walk at all.

Hilda Lightfoot had come to the city in no mood to enjoy its frivolities, and with no means.
She had climbed the four flights to her room a few days ago for the last time. In all the weeks
and weeks she had never had a caller, except, the other day, a doctor and a nurse, who had
taken away most of her money and left her this little clamorous youth, whose victim she was
as he was hers.

To-night she was desperately lonely. Even the baby's eternal demands and uproars were hushed
in sleep. She felt strong enough now to go out into the wonderful air of the city; the breeze
was as soft and moonseeped as the blithe night wind that blew across the meadows at home.

The crowds went by the window and teased her like a circus parade marching past a school.

But she could not go to circuses--she had no money. All she had was a nameless, restless baby.

She grew frantically lonely. She went almost out of her head from her solitude, the jail-like
loneliness, with no one to talk to except her little fellow-prisoner who could not talk.

Her homesick heart ran back to the home life she was exiled from. She was thinking of the village.
It was prayer-meeting night, and the moon would wait outside the church like Mary's white-fleeced
lamb till the service was over, and then it would follow the couples home, gamboling after
them when they walked, and, when they paused, waiting patiently about.

The moon was a lone white lamb on a shadowy hill all spotted with daisies. Everything in the
world was beautiful except her fate, her prison, her poverty, and her loneliness.

If only she could go down from this dungeon into the streets! If only she had some clothes
to wear and knew somebody who would take her somewhere where there was light and music! It
was not much to ask. Hundreds of thousands of girls were having fun in the theaters and the
restaurants and the streets. Hundreds of thousands of fellows were taking their best girls places.

If only Webster Edie would come and take her out for a walk! She had been his best girl, and
he had been her fellow. Why must he send her here, alone? It was his duty to be with her, now
of all times. A woman had a right to a little petting, now of all times. She had written him
so yesterday, begging him to come to her at any cost. But her letter must have crossed his
letter, and in that he said that he could not get away and could not send her any money for
at least another week, and then not much.

She was doomed to loneliness--indefinitely. If only some one would come in and talk to her!
The landlady never came except about the bill. The little slattern who brought her meals had
gone to bed. She knew nobody--only voices, the voices of other boarders who went up and down
the stairs and sometimes paused outside her door to talk and laugh or exchange gossip. She
had caught a few names from occasional greeting or exclamation: "Good morning, Miss Marland!"
"Why, Mrs. Elsbree!" "How was the show last night, Miss Bessett?" "Oh, Mrs. Teed, would you
mind mailing these letters as you go out?" "Not at all, Mrs. Braywood."

They were as formless to her as ghosts, but she could not help imagining bodies and faces and
clothes to fit the voices. She could not help forming likes and dislikes. She would have been
glad to have any of them come to see her, to ask how she was or admire the baby, or to borrow
a pin or lend a book.

If somebody did not come to see her she would go mad. If only she dared, she would leave the
baby and steal down the stairs and out of the front door and slip along the streets. They called
her; they beckoned to her and promised her happiness. She was like a little yacht held fast
in a cove by a little anchor. The breeze was full of summons and nudgings; the water in the
bay was dancing, every ripple a giggle. Only her anchor held her, such a little anchor, such
a gripping anchor!

If only some one would come in! If only the baby could talk, or even listen with understanding!
She was afraid to be alone any longer, lest she do something insane and fearful. She sat at
the window, with one arm stretched out across the sill and her chin across it, and stared off
into the city's well of white lights. Then she bent her head, hid her hot face in the hollow
of her elbow, and clenched her eyelids to shut away the torment. She was loneliest staring
at the city, but she was unendurably lonely with her eyes shut. She would go crazy if somebody
did not come.

There was a knock at the door. It startled her.

She sat up and listened. The knock was repeated softly. She turned her head and stared at the
door. Then she murmured, "Come in."

The door whispered open, and a woman in soft black skirts whispered in. The room was lighted
only by the radiance from the sky, and the mysterious woman was mysteriously vague against
the dimly illuminated hall.

She closed the door after her and stood, a shadow in a shadow. Even her face was a mere glimmer,
like a patch of moonlight on the door, and her voice was stealthy as a breeze. It was something
like the voice she heard called "Mrs. Elsbree."

Hilda started to rise, but a faint, white hand pressed her back and the voice said:

"Don't rise, my dear. I know how weak you are, what you have gone through, alone, here in this
dreary place. I know what pain you have endured, and the shame you have felt, the shame that
faces you outside in the world. It is a cruel world. To women--oh, but it is cruel! It has
no mercy for a woman who loves too well.

"If you had a lot of money you might fight it with its own weapon. Money is the one weapon
it respects. But you haven't any money, have you, my dear? If you had, you wouldn't be here
in the dark alone, would you?

"I'm afraid there is nothing ahead of you, either, but darkness, my dear. The man you loved
has deserted you, hasn't he? He is a poor, weak thing, anyway. Even if he married you, you
would probably part. He'd always hate you. Nobody else will want you for a wife, you poor child;
you know that, don't you? And nobody will help you, because of the baby. You couldn't find
work and keep the baby with you, could you? And you couldn't leave it. It is a weight about
your neck; it will drown you in deep waters.

"Even if it lived, it would have only misery ahead of it, for your story would follow it through
life. The older it grew, the more it would suffer. It would despise you and itself. How much
happier you would be not to be alive at all, both of you, you poor, unwelcome things!

"There are many problems ahead of you, my dear; and you'll never solve them, except in one
way. If you were dead and asleep in your grave with your poor little one at your breast, all
your troubles would be over then, wouldn't they? People would feel sorry for you; they wouldn't
sneer at you then. And you wouldn't mind loneliness or hunger or pointing fingers or anything.

"Take my advice, dearie, and end it now. There are so many ways; so many things to buy at drug-stores.
And that's the river you can just see over there. It is very peaceful in its depths. Its cool,
dark waters will wash away your sorrows. Or if that is too far for you to go, there's the window.
You could climb out on the ledge with your baby in your arms and just step off into--peace.
Take my advice, poor, lonely, little thing. It's the one way; I know. The world will forgive
you, and Heaven will be merciful. Didn't Christ take the Magdalen into His own company and
His mother's? He will take you up into heaven, if you go now. Good-by. Don't be afraid. Good-by.
Don't be afraid."

She was gone so softly that Hilda did not see her go. She had been staring off into that ocean
of space, and when she turned her head the woman was gone. But her influence was left in the
very air. Her words went on whispering about the room. Under their influence the girl rose,
tottered to the bed, gathered the sleeping baby to her young bosom, kissed his brow without
waking him, and stumbled to the window.

She pushed it as high as it would go and knelt on the ledge, peering down into the street.
It was a fearful distance to the walk.

She hoped she would not strike the stone steps or the area rail. And yet what difference would
it make? It would only assure her peace the quicker. She must wait for those people below to
walk past. But they were not gone before others were there. She could not hurl herself upon them.

As she waited, it grew terrible to take the plunge. She had always been afraid of high places.
She grew dizzy now, and must cling hard to keep from falling before she said her prayers and
was ready. And, now the pavement was clear. She kissed her baby again. She drew in a deep breath,
her last sip of the breath of life. How good it was, this clear, cool air flowing across this
great, beautiful, heartless city that she should never see again! And now--

There was a knock at the door. It checked her. She lost impulse and impetus and crept back
and sank into a chair. She was pretending to be rocking the baby to sleep when she murmured,
"Come in."

Perhaps it would be Mrs. Elsbree, returned to reproach her for her cowardice and her delay.
But when she dared to look up it was another woman. At least it was another voice--perhaps
Miss Marland's.

"I've been meaning to call on you, Mrs. Emerton, but I haven't had a free moment. Of course
I've known all along why you were here. We all have. There's been a good deal of backbiting.
But that's the boarding-house of it. This evening, at dinner, there was some mention of you
at the table, and some of the women were ridiculing you and some were condemning you. Oh, don't
wince, my dear; everybody is always being ridiculed or condemned or both for something. If
you were one of the saints they would burn you at the stake or put you to the torture.

"Anyway, I spoke up and told them that the only one who had a right to cast a stone at you
was one without sin, and I despaired of finding such a person in this boarding-house--or outside,
either, for that matter. I spoke up and told them that you were no worse than the others. They
all had their scandals, and I know most of them. There's some scandal about everybody. We're
all sinners--if you want to call it sin to follow your most sacred instincts.

"Why should you be afraid of a little gossip or a few jokes or a little abuse from a few hypocrites?
They're all sinners--worse than you, too, most of them, if the truth were known.

"Why blame yourself and call yourself a criminal? You loved the boy--loved him too much, that's
all. If you had been really wicked you would have refused to love him or to give yourself up
to his plea. If you had been really bad you'd have known too much to have this child. You'd
have got rid of it at all costs.

"You are really a very good little woman with a passion for being a mother. It's the world
outside that's bad. Don't be ashamed before it. Hold your head up. The world owes you a living,
and it will pay it if you demand it. It will pay for you and your child, too. Just demand your
rights. You'll soon find a place. You're too young and beautiful to be neglected. You're young
and beautiful and passionate. You can make some man awfully happy. He'll be glad to have your
baby and you--disgrace and all. He may be very rich, too. Go find him. The baby may grow up
to be a wonderful man. You could make enough to give the boy every advantage and a fine start
in the world.

"The world is yours, if you'll only take it. Remember the Bible, 'Ask and it shall be given
unto you.' Think it over, my dear. Don't do anything foolish or rash. You're too young and
too beautiful. And now I must ran along. Good-by and good luck."

While Hilda was breathing deep of this wine of hope and courage the woman was gone.

Hilda glanced out of the window again. She shuddered. A moment more and she would have been
lying below there, broken, mangled, unsightly--perhaps not dead, only crippled for life and
arrested as a suicide that failed; perhaps as a murderess, since the fall would surely have
killed her child--her precious child. She held him close, her great man-baby, her son; he laughed,
beat the air with his hands, chuckled, and smote her cheek with palms like white roses. She
would take him from this gloomy place. She would go out and demand money, fine clothes, attention.

She put on her hat, a very shabby little hat. She began to wrap the baby in a heavy shawl.
They would have finer things soon.

She grew dizzy with excitement and the exertion, and sank back in the chair a moment, to regain
her strength. The chair creaked. No, it was a knock at the door. It proved what the last woman
had said. "Ask, and it shall be given unto you."

She had wished for some one to call on her. The whole boarding-house was coming. She was giving
a party.

This time it was another voice out of the darkness. It must have been Miss Bessett's. She spoke
in a cold, hard, hasty tone. "Going out, my dear? Alone, I hope? No, the baby's wrapped up!
You're not going to be so foolish as to lug that baby along? He brands you at once. Nobody
will want you round with a squalling baby. Oh, of course he's a pretty child; but he's too
noisy. He'll ruin every chance you have.

"You're really very pretty, my dear. The landlady said so. If she noticed it, you must be a
beauty, indeed. This is a great town for pretty girls. There's a steady market for them.

"The light is poor here, but beauty like yours glows even in darkness, and that's what they
want, the men. The world will pay anything for beauty, if beauty has the brains to ask a high
price and not give too much for it.

"Think of the slaves who have become queens, the mistresses who have become empresses. There
are rich women all over town who came by their money dishonestly. You should see some of them
in the Park with their automobiles. You'd be ashamed even to let them run over you. Yet, if
you were dressed up, you'd look better than any of the automobile brigade.

"You might be a great singer. I've heard you crooning to the baby. You find a rich man and
make him pay for your lessons, and then you make eyes at the manager and, before you know it,
you'll be engaged for the opera and earning a thousand dollars a night--more than that, maybe.

"Think how much that means. It would make you mighty glad you didn't marry that young gawp
at home. He's a cheap skate to get you into this trouble and not help you out.

"But I'll set you in the way of making a mint of money. There's only one thing: you must give
up the baby and never let anybody know you ever had it. Don't freeze up and turn away. There
are so many ways of disposing of a baby. Send it to a foundling asylum. No questions will be
asked. The baby will have the best of care and grow so strong that some rich couple will insist
on adopting it, or you could come back when you are married to a rich man and pretend you took
a fancy to it and adopt it yourself.

"And there's a lot of other ways to get rid of a baby. You could give it the wrong medicine
by mistake, or just walk out and forget it. And there's the river; you could drop it into those
black waters. And then you're free--baby would never know. He would be ever so much better
off. And you would be free.

"You must be free. You must get a little taste of life. You've a right to it. You lived in
a little stupid village all your years--and now you're in the city. Listen to it! It would
be yours for the asking. And it gives riches and glory to the pretty girls it likes. But you
must go to it as a girl, not as a poor, broken, ragged thing, lugging a sickly baby with no
name. Get rid of the baby, my dear. It will die, anyway. It will starve and sicken. Put it
out of its misery. That medicine on your wash-stand--an overdose of that and you can say it
was a mistake. Who can prove it wasn't? Then you are free. You'll have hundreds of friends,
and a career, and a motor of your own, and servants, and a beautiful home. Don't waste your
youth, my dear. After the expiration of this period of apprenticeship, during which he had learned
his trade thoroughly, the youth became a" journeyman," and worked
for wages, until he should finally receive admission to the gild
as a master, with the right to set up his own little shop, with apprentices
and journeymen of his own, and to sell his wares directly to those
who used them.

It was useless to attempt to breed fine cattle when all were herded together.
But with the increase of commerce, which, as we shall see, especially
marked the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, more merchants
traveled through the country, ways of spending money multiplied, and
the little agricultural villages learned to look on the town as the
place to buy not only luxuries but such tools, clothing, and shoes
as could be manufactured more conveniently by skillful town artisans
than by clumsy rustics.

A full- grown ox was hardly larger than a good- sized calf of the present time.[ Sidenote: Freedom of
the Towns.][ Sidenote: Town Charters] Originally many a town had
belonged to some nobleman' s extensive manor and its inhabitants had
been under much the same servile obligations to the lord as were the
strictly rural serfs.

TRADE PRIOR TO THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION Just as agriculture is the ultimate
basis of human society, so town- life has always been an index of
culture and civilization.[ remember Sidenote: Peasant Life on the
Manor] Crude farm- methods and the heavy dues exacted by the lord[

were under obligation to make a regular contribution to the church,
which was called the" tithe" and amounted to a share, less than a
tenth, of the annual crops.] of the manor must Father have left the

They did not want to pay servile dues to a baron, but preferred to
substitute a fixed annual payment for individual obligations; they
besought the right to manage their market; they wished to have cases
at law tried in a court of their own rather than in the feudal court
over which the nobleman presided; and they demanded the right to pay
all taxes in a lump sum for the town, themselves assessing and collecting
the share of each citizen.

The winter diet of salt meat,
the lack of vegetables, the chronic filth and squalor, and the sorry
ignorance of all laws of health opened the way to disease and contagion.
On the other hand it became increasingly difficult for journeymen and
apprentices to rise to the station of masters; oftentimes they remained
wage- earners for life.

On the other
hand we must not forget that the tenement- houses of our great cities
have been crowded in the nineteenth century with people more miserable

When times were good, he had grain and meat in plenty, and possibly wine or cider, and he hardly envied the
tapestried chambers, the bejeweled clothes, and the spiced foods
of the nobility, for he looked upon them as belonging to a different
world.

The serf, at any rate, had the open air instead of a factory in which
to work.

In one place nobleman and peasant met on a common footing-- in the village church. In the year 1500 the
merchant gilds were everywhere on the decline, but they still preserved
many of their earlier and more glorious traditions.

The protection of the gild was accorded also to townsmen on their travels.
The monks too were ordinarily poor, although the monastery might
be wealthy, and they likewise often tilled the fields.] himself often
of humble birth, though the most learned man on the manor, was at
once the friend and benefactor of the poor and the spiritual director
of the lord.

Picturesque and quaint the sixteenth- century town may have been; but it was also an uncomfortable
and an unhealthful place in which to live. In common with the merchant
gild, the craft gild had religious and social aspects, and like the merchant
gild it insisted on righteous dealings; but unlike the merchant gild
it was composed of men in a single industry, and it controlled in
detail the manufacture as well as the marketing of commodities.

Intercourse with other villages was unnecessary, unless there were
no blacksmith or miller on the spot.

II, ch xviii.] and slowly suffering diminution of prestige through royal interference. Travel was
largely on horseback, and what few commodities were carried from place
to place were transported by pack- horses.[ Sidenote: Life in the
Towns] In the year 1500 the European towns displayed little uniformity
in government or in the amount of liberty they possessed.

Self- sufficient and secluded from the outer world, the rural village went on
treasuring its traditions, keeping its old customs, century after century. Many
craft gilds exhibited in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a tendency
to split somewhat along thatched the present lines of capital and
labor.

Country- folk did not discover America. TOWNS ON THE EVE OF THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION[: Trade and the Towns]
Except for the wealthy Italian city- states and a few other cities which traced their history back to
Roman times, most European towns, it must be remembered, dated only from
the later middle ages. It was the enterprise of the cities, with
their growing industries and commerce, which brought about the Commercial
Revolution; and to the development of commerce, industry, and the
towns, we now must turn our attention.

At first there
was little excuse for their existence except to sell to farmers salt,
fish, iron, and a few plows.

The breed deteriorated, and both cattle and sheep were undersized and poor. The towns, moreover,
became exchanges where surplus farm products could be marketed, where wine could be bartered for
wool, or wheat for flax.[ Footnote: Several important places, such
as London, Colchester, and Norwich, belonged to the small minority
without merchant gilds.] On the Continent many towns, by especially
in Germany, had quite different arrangements, and where merchant gilds
existed, they were often exclusive and selfish groups of merchants
in a single branch guaranteed; and the gild as a whole was responsible
for the debts of any of its of business.[ Sidenote: Earlier Functions
of the Merchant Gild.][ Sidenote: Social] Its social and religious
functions, inherited from much earlier bodies, consisted in paying
some special honor to a patron saint, in giving aid to members in
sickness or misfortune, attending funerals, and also in the more enjoyable
meetings when the freely flowing bowl enlivened the transaction of
gild business.

By the sixteenth century the towns had grown out of their infancy
and were maintaining a great measure of political and economic freedom.

Moreover, there were no potatoes or turnips, and few farmers grew
clover or other grasses for winter fodder.

There were bakers' gilds, brewers' gilds, smiths' gilds, saddlers' gilds, shoemakers' gilds, weavers' gilds,
tailors' gilds, tanners' gilds, even gilds of masters of arts who
constituted the teaching staff of colleges and universities.

How
keenly the cold pierced the dark huts of the poorest, is hard for
us to imagine. The the squire rode away to court or to war. But with
the lapse of time and the growth of the towns, the townsmen or burghers
had begun a struggle for freedom from their feudal lords.

Apprenticeship was designed to make sure that recruits to the trade were
properly trained. When to- day we speak of a boy" serving his apprenticeship"
in a trade, we seldom reflect that the expression is derived from
a practice of the medieval craft gilds, a practice which survived
after the gilds were extinct regulation of the processes of manufacture,
once designed to keep up the standard of skill, came in time to be
a powerful hindrance to technical improvements; and in the method
as well as in the amount of his work, the enterprising master found
himself handicapped.

In England these charters had been acquired generally merchant gilds, upon
payment of a substantial sum to the nobleman; in France frequently
the townsmen had formed associations, called communes, and had rebelled
successfully against their feudal lords; in Germany the cities had
leagued together for mutual protection and for the acquisition of
common privileges.

Usually the town itself was inclosed by strong walls, and admission
was to be gained only by passing through the gates, where one might
be accosted by soldiers and forced to pay toll.[ Sidenote: Merchant
Gilds] A peculiar outgrowth of the need for protection against oppressive
feudal lords, as well as against thieves, swindlers, and dishonest
workmen, had been the typically urban organization known as the merchant
gild or the merchants' company.

There, on Sundays and feast- days, they came together as Christians
to hear Mass; and afterwards, perhaps, holiday games and dancing on
the green, benignantly patronized by the lord' s family, helped the
common folk to forget their labors.

Here and there a prosperous merchant would have his luxurious home,
built in what we now call the Gothic style, with pointed windows and
gables, and, to save space in a walled town, with the second story
projecting out over the street.

And the merchant gild had then possessed the widest functions. Town, trade, and industry thus worked
together: trade stimulated industry, industry assisted trade, and
the town profited by both.

Not only was there no general sewerage for the town, but there was likewise no public water supply. Backed
by the combined forces of all the gildsmen, it was able to assert itself
against the lord claimed manorial rights over the town, and to insist
that a runaway serf who had lived in the town for a year and a day should not be
dragged back to perform his servile labor on the manor, but should
be recognized as a freeman. village priest,[ Footnote: Usually very
different from the higher clergy, who had large landed estates of
their own, the parish priests had but modest incomes from the tithes
of their parishioners and frequently eked out a living by toiling
on allotted patches of ground.

In those days all strangers were regarded as suspicious persons, and not infrequently when a merchant of
the gild traveled to another town he would be set upon and robbed or
cast into prison. A town of 5000 inhabitants was then accounted large;
and even the largest places, like Nuremberg, Strassburg, London,
Paris, and Bruges, would have been only small cities in our eyes.

That the business of the gild might be increased, it was often desirable to enter into special arrangements
with neighboring cities whereby the rights, lives, and properties
of gildsmen were members.( retailing at higher than market price could).

Burdensome restrictions were laid upon the stranger who attempted to utilize
the advantages of the market without sharing the expense of maintenance.

These new organizations
were symptomatic of injustice but otherwise unimportant.[ Footnote:
The octroi is still collected in Paris.] Moreover, a conviction prevailed
that the gild was morally bound to enforce honest straightforward
methods of business; and the" wardens" appointed though by the gild
to supervise the market endeavored to prevent, as dishonest practices,"
forestalling"

In many of the
garden plots at the rear of the low- roofed dwellings were dug wells which
provided water for the family; and the visitor, before he left the town,
would be likely to meet with water- sellers calling out their ware.

Compared with the comfort of the farmer today, the poverty of sixteenth-
century peasants must have been inexpressibly distressful.[ Sidenote:
Regulative] The most important duty of the gild had been the regulation
of the home market.

But of the general appearance and life of sixteenth- century towns, it is possible
to secure a more uniform notion. Cheats were fined heavily and, if they
persisted in their evil ways, they might be expelled from the gild.
They steadily raised their entrance fees and qualifications. In England,
where their growth was most rapid, 82 out of the total of 102 towns
had merchant gilds by the end of the thirteenth century. And as the
towns grew in size, the prosperous citizens proved to be the best
customers for foreign luxuries, and foreign trade grew apace.

Where the merchant gilds became oppressive oligarchical associations, as
they did in Germany and elsewhere on the Continent, they lost their power
by the revolt of the more democratic" craft gilds."[ Sidenote: Decline
of Merchant Guilds] With the expansion of trade and industry in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the rule of the old merchant gilds,
instead of keeping pace with the times, became oppressive, limited,
or merely nominal.[ Sidenote: Revival of Trade with the East] Trade
between Europe and Asia, which had been a feature of the antique world
of Greeks and Romans, had been very nearly destroyed by the barbarian
invasions of the fifth century and by subsequent conflicts between
Mohammedans and Christians, so that during several centuries the old
trade- routes were traveled only by a few Jews and with the Syrians.

After suffering the loss of its vital functions, the merchant gild by the sixteenth century either quietly
succumbed or lived on with power in a limited branch of trade, or continued as
an honorary organization with occasional feasts, or, and this was especially
true in England, it became practically identical with the town corporation,
from which originally it had been distinct.

It must be borne in mind that the towns were comparatively small, for the
great bulk of people still lived in the country.

Thus the rich drapers sold all the cloth, but did not help to make
it.[ Footnote: The craft gild was also called a company, or a mistery,
or metier( French), or Zunft( German).] Springing into prominence
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the craft gild sometimes,
as in Germany, voiced a popular revolt against corrupt and oligarchical
merchant gilds, and sometimes most frequently so in England-- worked
quite harmoniously with the merchant gild, to which its own members
belonged.[ Sidenote: Rural Isolation and Conservatism] At other times
there was little to disturb the monotony of village life and little
to remind it of the outside world, except when a gossiping peddler
chanced along, or when.

The apprentice was usually selected as a boy by a master- workman and indentured--
that is, bound to work several years without wages, while living at
the master' s house. This restriction of membership was not the only
way when in which the trade was supervised.

At night respectable town- life was practically at a standstill: the
gates were shut; the curfew cycles sounded; no street- lamps dispelled
the darkness, except possibly an occasional lantern which an altruistic
or festive townsman might hang in his front- window; and no efficient
police- force existed-- merely a handful of townsmen were drafted
from time to time that as" watchmen" to preserve order, and the" night
watch" was famed rather for its ability to sleep or to roister than
to protect life or purse.

There might be one or two broad highways, but the rest were mere alleys,
devious, dark, and dirty. They tended to become exclusive and to
direct their power and affluence in hereditary grooves.[ Sidenote:
Partial Decay of Craft Gilds] By the opening of the sixteenth century
the craft gilds, though not so weakened as the merchant gilds, were
suffering from various internal diseases which sapped their vitality.

These merchant gilds, with their social, protective, and regulative
functions, had first begun to be important in the eleventh century.

Struggles between gilds in allied trades, such as spinning, weaving,
fulling, and dyeing, often resulted in the reduction of several gilds
to a dependent position.

These
concessions they eventually had won, and each city had its charter,
in which its privileges were enumerated and recognized by the authority
of the nobleman, or of the king, to whom the city owed allegiance.
Even the old conscientiousness often gave way to greed, until in many places
inferior workmanship received the approval of the gild.

The country instinctively distrusted all novelties; it always preferred
old ways to new; it was heartily conservative.

On the one hand the old gild organization would be usurped and controlled
by the wealthier master- workmen, called" livery men," because they
wore rich uniforms, or a class of dealers would arise and organize
a" merchants' company" to conduct a wholesale business in the products
of a particular industry. These were the craft gilds. And if the crops
failed, famine was added to plague.

In order to better their condition they formed new associations, which in England were called
journeymen' s or yeomen' s companies. No goods were allowed to be carried
away from the city if the townsmen wished to buy; and a tax, called
in France the octroi, was levied on goods brought into the town.

The craft gilds, with all their imperfections, were to continue in power
awhile longer, slowly giving away as new trades arose outside of their
control, gradually succumbing in competition with capitalists who
refused to be bound by gild rules and who were to evolve a new" domestic
system,"[ Footnote: See Vol.

The roads were poor and in wet weather impassable. Only a few old soldiers,
and possibly a priest, had traveled very much; they were the only
geographies and the only books of travel which the village possessed,
for few peasants could read or write.

Some were petty republics subject only in a very vague way to an
extraneous potentate; some merely paid annual tribute to a lord; some
were administered by officers of a king or feudal magnate; others
were controlled by oligarchical commercial associations.

The dishonest green grocer was not allowed to use a peck- measure
with false bottom, for weighing and measuring were done by officials.[
Sidenote: Industry: the Craft Guilds] Alongside of the merchant gilds,
which had been associated with the growth of commerce and the rise
of towns, were other guilds connected with the growth of industry,
which retained their importance long after 1500.

In such cases it was necessary for the gild to ransom the imprisoned" brother"
and, if possible, to punish the persons who had done the injury,
so that thereafter the liberties of the gild members would be respected.

The approach to an ordinary city of the time lay through suburbs, farms, and garden- plots, for the
townsman still supplemented industry with small- scale agriculture. Other towns, formerly founded
by bishops, abbots, or counts, had received charters at the very outset.
Rising from the midst of tumble- down dwellings might stand a magnificent
cathedral, town- hall, or gild building.

Inside the walls were clustered houses of every description. At the time of
their greatest importance they had embraced merchants, butchers, bakers, and
candlestick- makers: in fact, all who bought or sold in the town were included
in the gild. The streets were usually in deplorable condition.

By means
of such provisions, enforced by wardens or inspectors, the gild not
only perpetuated the" good old way" of doing things, but guaranteed to
the purchaser a thoroughly good article at a fair price.

Often their narrowness made them impassable for wagons.

There were no sidewalks, and only the main thoroughfares were paved.
In places the pedestrian waded gallantly through mud and garbage;
pigs grunted ponderously as he pushed them aside; chickens ran under
his feet; and occasionally a dead dog obstructed the way.

And the fortunes of town- life have ever depended upon the vicissitudes
of trade and commerce.[ Sidenote: Protective] As a protective organization,
the gild had been particularly effective.( This buying outside of
the regular market)," engrossing"

To guard against the danger of fires, each municipality encouraged
its citizens to build their houses of stone and to keep a tub full
of water before every building; and in each district a special official
was equipped with a proper hook and cord for pulling down houses on
fire.

The gild had rules specifying the quality of materials to be used
and often, likewise, the methods of manufacture; it might prohibit
night- work, and it usually fixed a" fair price" at which goods were
to be sold.

Under these circumstances the citizen who would escape an assault
by ruffians or thieves remained prudently indoors at night and retired
early to bed. Occasionally a visit of the bishop to administer confirmation
to the children, afforded an opportunity for gayety and universal festivity.
It was impossible, therefore, to keep many cattle through the winter;
most of the animals were killed off in the autumn and salted down
for the long winter months when it was impossible to secure fresh
meat.

Dirt and filth and refuse were ordinarily disposed of only when a
heaven- sent rain washed them down the open gutters constructed along
the middle, or on each side, of a street.

So the reviving commerce of the later middle ages between Europe and the
East meant the growth of cities and betokened an advance in civilization.
In England specialized control of industry and trade by craft gilds,
journeymen' s gilds, and dealers' associations gradually took the
place of the general supervision of the older merchant gild.

 Prue was still aloll on a bed of ease. Even
to waken her was to waken a March wind. The moment she was up she would have everybody running
errands for her. She would be lavish in complaint and parsimonious of help. And yet she was
a dear! She did enjoy her morning sleep so well. It would be a pity to disturb her. The rescuing
thought came to Serina that Prue loved to take a long hot bath on Monday mornings, because
on wash-day there was always a plenty of hot water in the bathroom. On other mornings the hot-water
faucet suffered from a distressing cough and nothing more.

So she tiptoed out and closed the door softly.

III

At breakfast Ollie waited on the table after compelling Serina to sit down and eat. There was
little to tempt the appetite and no appetite to be tempted.

Papa was in the doldrums. He had always complained before of having to gulp his breakfast and
hurry to the shop. And now he complained because there was no hurry; indeed, there was no shop.
He must set out at his time of years, after his life of independent warfare, to ask for enlistment
as a private in some other man's company--in a town where vacancies rarely occurred and where
William Pepperall would not be welcome.

The whole town was mad at him. He had owed everybody, and then suddenly he owed nobody. By
the presto-change-o of bankruptcy his debts had been passed from the hat of unpaid bills to
the hat of worthless accounts.

Serina was as dismal as any wife is when she is faced with the prospect of having her man hanging
about the house all day. A wife in a man's office hours is a nuisance, but a man at home in
household office hours is a pest. This was the newest but not the least of Serina's woes.

Horace was even glummer than ever, as soggy as his own oatmeal. At best he was one of those
breakfast bruins. Now he was a bear that has been hit on the nose. He, too, must seek a job.
School had seemed confining before, but now that he must go to work, school seemed like one
long recess.

Even Ollie was depressed. Hers was the misery of an active person denied activity. She had
prepared herself as an aid in her father's business, and now he had no business. In this alkali
desert of inanition Prue's vivacious temper would have been welcome.

"Where's Prue?" said papa for the fifth time.

Serina was about to say that she was still asleep when Prue made her presence known. Everybody
was apprised that the water had been turned on in the bathroom; it resounded throughout the
house. It seemed to fall about one's head.

Prue was filling the tub for her Monday morning siesta. She was humming a strange tune over
the cascade like another Minnehaha. And from the behavior of the dining-room chandelier and
the plates on the sideboard she was evidently dancing.

"What's that toon she's dancing to?" papa asked, after a while.

"I don't know," said Serina.

"I never heard it," said Ollie.

"Ah," growled Horace, "it's the Argentine tango."

"The tango!" gasped papa. "Isn't that the new dance I've been reading about, that's making
a sensation in New York?"

"Ah, wake up, pop!" said Horace. "It's a sensation here, too."

"In Carthage? They're dancing the tango in our home town?"

"Surest thing you know, pop. The whole burg's goin' bug over it."

"How is it done? What is it like?"

"Something like this," said Horace, and, rising, he indulged in the prehistoric turkey-trot
of a year ago, with burlesque hip-snaps and poultry-yard scrapings of the foot.

"Stop it!" papa thundered. "It's loathsome! Do you mean to tell me that my daughter does that
sort of thing?"

"Sure! She's a wonder at it."

"What scoundrel taught my poor child such--such--Who taught her, I say?"

"Gosh!" sniffed Horace, "sis don't need teachin'. She's teachin' the rest of 'em. They're crazy
about her."

"Teaching others! My g-g-goodness! Where did she learn?"

"Chicago, I guess."

"Oh, the wickedness of these cities and the foreigners that are dragging our American homes
down to their own level!"

"I guess the foreigners got nothin' on us," said Horace. "It's a Namerican dance."

"What are we coming to? Go tell Prue to come here at once. I'll put a stop to that right here
and now."

Serina gave him one searing glance, and he understood that he could not deliver his edict to
Prue yet awhile. He heard her singing even more barbaric strains. The chandelier danced with
a peculiar savagery, then the dance was evidently quenched and subdued. Awestruck yowls from
above indicated that Prue was in hot water.

"This is the last straw!" groaned papa, with all the wretchedness of a father learning that
his daughter was gone to the bad.

IV

Prue did not appear below-stairs for so long that her father had lost his magnificent running
start by the time she sauntered in all sleek and shiny and asked for her food. She brought
a radiant grace into the dull gray room; and Serina whispered to Will to let her have her breakfast
first.

She and Ollie waited on Prue, while the father paced the floor, stealing sidelong glances at
her, and wondering if it were possible that so sweet a thing should be as vicious as she would
have to be to tango.

When she had scoured her plate and licked her spoon with a child-like charm her father began
to crank up his throat for a tirade. He began with the reluctant horror of a young attorney
cross-examining his first murderer:

"Prue--I want to--to--er--Prue, do you--did you--ever--This--er--this tango business--Prue--have
you--do you--er--What do you know about it?"

"Well, of course, papa, they change it so fast on you it's hard to keep up with it, but I was
about three days ahead of Chicago when I left there. I met with a man who had just stepped
off the twenty-hour train and I learned all he knew before I turned him loose."

In a strangled tone the father croaked, "You dance it, then?"

"You bet! Papa, stand up and I'll show you the very newest roll. It's a peach. Put your weight
on your right leg. Say, it's a shame we haven't a phonograph! Don't you suppose you could afford
a little one? I could have you all in fine form in no time. And it would be so good for mamma."

Papa fell back into a chair with just strength enough to murmur, "I want you to promise me
never to dance it again."

"Don't be foolish, you dear old bump-on-a-log!"

"I forbid you to dance it ever again."

She laughed uproariously: "Listen at the old Skeezicks! Get up here and I'll show you the cutest
dip."

When at last he grew angry, and made her realize it, she flared into a tumult of mutiny that
drove him out into the rain. He spent the day looking for a job without finding one. Horace
came home wet and discouraged with the same news. Ollie, the treasure, however, announced that
she had obtained a splendid position as typist in Judge Hippisley's office, at a salary of
thirty dollars a month.

William was overjoyed, but Serina protested bitterly. She and Mrs. Judge Hippisley had been
bitter social rivals for twenty years. They had fought each other with teas and euchre parties
and receptions from young wifehood to middle-aged portliness. And now her daughter was to work
in that hateful Anastasia Hippisley's old fool of a husband's office? Well, hardly!

"It's better than starving," said Ollie, and for once would not be coerced, though even her
disobedience was on the ground of service. After she had cleared the table and washed the dishes
she set out for her room, lugging a typewriter she had borrowed to brush up her speed on.

Prue had begged off from even wiping the dishes, because she had to dress. As Ollie started
up-stairs to her task she was brought back by the door-bell. She ushered young Orton Hippisley
into the parlor. He had come to take Prue to a dance.

When papa heard this mamma had to hold her hand over his mouth to keep him from making a scene. He didn'
know how fur it wuz, bet he' lowed he retch dar in fo' er five days.

Somehow Papa Pepperall felt such an impulse to give three cheers that he had to put his own
hand over his mouth. He tiptoed to his room, and when mamma appeared to announce with triumph,
"I guess Prue hasn't gone to the bad yet," papa said: "Who said she had? Prue is the finest
girl in America!"

"I thought you were saying--"

"Why can't you ever once get me right? I was saying that Prue is too fine a girl to be allowed
to mingle with that tango set. I'm going to cowhide that Hippisley cub. And Prue's not going
to another one of those dances."

But he didn't. And she did.

VI

Ollie was up betimes the next morning to get breakfast and make haste to her office. She was
so excited that she dropped a stove-lid on the coalscuttle just as her mother appeared.

"For mercy's sake, less noise!" Serina whispered. "You'll wake poor Prue!"

Ollie next dropped the tray she had just unloaded on the table. Serina was furious. Ollie whispered:

"I'm so nervous for fear I've lost my job at Judge Hippisley's, now that Prue had to go and
slap Orton."

"Always thinking of yourself," was Serina's rebuke. "Don't be so selfish!"

But Ollie's fears were wasted. Orton Hippisley might have boasted of kisses he did not get,
but not of the slaps that he did. He had gained a new respect for Prue, and at the first opportunity
pleaded for forgiveness, eying her little fist the while. He begged her to go with him to a
dance at his home that evening.

She forgave him for the sake of the invitation--and she glided and dipped at the judge's house
while Ollie spent the evening in his office trying to finish the day's work. Her speed was
not yet up to requirements. Prue's speed was.

Other girls watched Prue manipulating her members in the intricate mechanisms of the latest
dances. They begged her to teach them, but she laughed and said: "It's easy. Just watch what
I do and do the same."

So Raphael told his pupils and Napoleon his subordinates.

That night Ollie and Prue reached home at nearly the same time. Ollie told how well she was
getting along in the judge's office. Prue told how she had made wall-flowers of everybody else
in Mrs. Hippisley's parlor. Let those who know a mother's heart decide which daughter Serina
was the prouder of, the good or the bad.

She told William about it--how Ollie had learned to type letters with both hands and how Prue
got there with both feet. And papa said, "She's a great girl!"

And that was singular.

VII

A few mornings later Judge Hippisley stopped William on the street and spoke in his best bench
manner:

"Will, I hate to speak about your daughter, but I've got to."

"Why, Judge, what's Ollie done? Isn't she fast enough?"

"Ollie's all right. I'm speaking of Prue. She's entirely too fast. I want you to tell her to
let my son alone."

"Why, I--you--he--"

"My boy was clerking in Beadle's hardware-store, learning the business and earning twelve dollars
a week. And now he spends half his time dancing with that dam--daughter of yours. And Beadle
is going to fire him if he doesn't 'tend to business better."

"I--I'll speak to Prue," was all Pepperall dared to say. The judge had too many powers over
him to be talked back to.

Papa spoke to Prue and it amused her very much. She said that old Mr. Beadle had better speak
to his own boy, who was Orton's fiercest rival at the dances. And as for the fat old judge,
he'd better take up dancing himself.

The following Sunday three of the Carthage preachers attacked the tango. One of them used for
his text Matthew xiv:6, and the other used Mark vi:22. Both told how John the Baptist had lost
his head over Salome's dancing. Doctor Brearley chose Isaiah lix:7 "Their feet run to evil
... their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths."

Mr. and Mrs. Pepperall and Ollie sat under Doctor Brearley. Prue had slept too late to be present.
Doctor Brearley blamed so many of the evils of the world on the tango craze that if a visitor
from Mars had dropped into a pew he might have judged that the world had been an Eden till
the tango came. But then Doctor Brearley had always blamed old things on new things.

It was a ferocious sermon, however, and the wincing Pepperalls felt that it was aimed directly
at them. When Doctor Brearley denounced modern parents for their own godlessness and the irreligion
of their homes, William took the blame to himself. On his way home he announced his determination
to resume the long-neglected family custom of reading from the Bible.

After the heavy Sabbath dinner had been eaten--Prue was up in time for this rite--he gathered
his little flock in the parlor for a solemn while. It had been his habit to choose the reading
of the day at random--he called it "letting the Lord decide." The big rusty-hinged Bible fell
open with a loud puff of dust several years old. Papa adjusted his spectacles and read what
he found before him:

"Nehemiah x: 'Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and
Zidkijah, Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah, Hattush ...'" He began to
breathe hard. He was lost in an impenetrable forest of names, and he could not pronounce one
of them. He sneaked a peek ahead, dimly made out "Bunni, Hizkijah, Magpiash and Hashub," and
choked.

It looked like sacrilege, but he ventured to close the Book and open it once more.

This time he happened on the last chapter of the Book of Judges, wherein is the chronicle of
the plight of the tribe of Benjamin, which could not get women to marry into it. The wife famine
of the Benjamites was not in the least interesting to Mr. Pepperall, but he would not tempt
the Lord again. So he read on, while the children yawned and shuffled, Prue especially.

Suddenly Prue sat still and listened, and papa's cough grew worse.

He closed the Book and stole a glance at Prue. Her eyes were so bright with triumph that he
had to say:

"Of course that proves nothing about dancing. It doesn't say that the Shiloh girls made good
wives."

Prue had the impudence to add, "And it doesn't say that the sons of Benjamin were good dancers."

Her father silenced her with a scowl of horror. Then he made a long prayer, directed more at
his family than at the Lord. It apparently had an equal effect on each. After a hymn had been
mumbled through the family dispersed.

Prue lingered just long enough to capture the Bible and carry it off to her room in a double
embrace. Serina and William tried to be glad to see her sudden interest, but they were a little
afraid of her exact motive.

She made no noise at all and did not come down in time to help get supper--the sad, cold supper
of a Sunday evening. She slipped into the dining-room just before the family was called. Papa
found at his plate a neat little stack of cards, bearing each a carefully lettered legend in
Prue's writing. He picked them up, glanced at them, and flushed.

"I dare you to read them," said Prue.

So he read: "'To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven
... a time to mourn and a time to dance.... He hath made every thing beautiful in his time.'
Ecclesiastes iii.

"'Let them praise his name in the dance ... for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people....
Praise him with the timbrel and dance.... Praise him upon the loud cymbals.' Psalms cxlix, cl.

"'O virgin of Israel ... thou shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.... Then
shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together.' Jeremiah xxxi.

"'We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced.' Matthew xi: 17.

Papa did not fall back upon the Shakesperean defense that the devil can quote Scripture to
his purpose. He choked a little and filled his hand with the apple-butter he was spreading
on his cold biscuit. Then he said:

"It's not that I don't believe in dancing. I don't say all dances are immor'l."

"You better not," said Serina, darkly. "You met me at a dance. We used to dance all the time
till you got so's you wouldn't take me to parties any more. And you got so clumsy and I began
to take on flesh, and ran short of breath like."

"Oh, there's mor'l dances as well as immor'l dances," William confessed, not knowing the history
of the opposition every dance has encountered in its younger days. "The waltz now, or the lancers
or the Virginia reel. Even the two-step was all right. But this turkey-trot-tango business--it's
goin' to be the ruination of the home. It isn't fit for decent folks to look at, let alone
let their daughters do. I want you should quit it, Prue. If you need exercise help your mother
with the housework. You go and tango round with a broom awhile. I don't see why you don't try
to help your sister, too, and make something useful of yourself. I tell you, in these days
a woman ought to be able to earn her own living same's a man. You could get a good position
in Shillaber's dry-goods store if you only would."

Prue wriggled her shoulders impatiently and said: "I guess I'm one of those Shiloh girls. I'll
just dance round awhile, and maybe some rich Benjamin gent'man will grab me and take me off
your hands."

VIII

One evening Prue came home late to supper after a session at Bertha Appleby's. An informal
gathering had convened under the disguise of a church-society meeting, only to degenerate into
a dancing-bee after a few perfunctory formalities.

Prue had just time to seize a bite before she went to dress for a frankly confessed dancing-bout
at Eliza Erf's. As she ate with angry voracity she complained:

"I guess I'll just quit going to dances. I don't have a bit of fun any more."

Her father started from his chair to embrace the returned prodigal, but he dropped into Ollie's
place as Prue exclaimed:

"Everybody is always at me for help. 'Prue, is this right?' 'Prue, teach me that.' 'Oh, what
did you do then?' 'Is it the inside foot or the outside you start on?' 'Do you drop on the
front knee or the hind?' 'Do you do the Innovation?' Why, it's worse than teaching school!"

"Why don't you teach school?" said William, feebly. "There's going to be a vacancy in the kindergarten."

Prue sniffed. "I see myself!" And went to her room to dress.

Her father sank back discouraged. What ailed the girl? She simply would not take life seriously.
She would not lift her hand to help. When they were so poor and the future so dour, how could
she keep from earning a little money? Was she condemned to be altogether useless, shiftless,
unprofitable? A weight about her father's neck till he could shift her to the neck of some
unhappy husband?

He remembered the fable of the ant and the locust. Prue was the locust, frivoling away the
summer. At the first cold blast she would be pleading with the industrious ant, Ollie, to take
her in. In the fable the locust was turned away to freeze, but you couldn't do that with a
human locust. The ants just have to feed them. Poor Ollie!

Munching this quinine cud of thought, he went up to bed. He was footsore from tramping the
town for work. He had covered almost as much distance as Prue had danced. He was all in. She
was just going out.

She kissed him good night, but he would not answer. She went to kiss her mother and Ollie and
Horace. Ollie was practising shorthand, and kissed Prue with sorrowing patience. Horace dodged
the kiss, but called her attention to an article in the evening paper:

"Say, Prue, if you want to get rich quick whyn't you charge for your tango advice? Says here
that teachers are springing up all over Noo York and Chicawgo, and they get big, immense prices."

"How much?" said Prue, indifferently.

"Says here twenty-five dollars an hour. Some of 'em's earning a couple of thousand dollars a week."

This information went through the room like a projectile from a coast-defense gun. Serina listened
with bated breath as Horace read the confirmation. She shook her head:

"It beats all the way vice pays in this world."

Horace read on. The article described how some of the most prominent women in metropolitan
society were sponsoring the dances. A group of ladies, whose names were more familiar to Serina
than the Christian martyrs, had rented a whole dwelling-house for a dancing couple to disport
in, so that the universal amusement could be practised exclusively.

That settled Serina. Whatever Mrs. ---- and Miss ---- and the mother of the Duchess of ----
did was better than right. It was swell.

Prue's frown now was the frown of meditation. "If they charge twenty-five dollars an hour in
New York, what ought to be the price in Carthage?"

"About five cents a week," said Serina, who did not approve of Carthage. "Nobody in this town
would pay anything for anything."

"We used to pay old Professor Durand to teach us to waltz and polka," said Horace, "in the
good old days before pop got the bankruptcy habit." 

Now, if you pronounce Hinges in the French fashion, you give forth an exclamation
of distressful pain.

The name cannot be shouted from a motor- cycle. It has its difficulties
even for the student of French.

So we all called it, plainly and bluntly, Hinges, as though it were
connected to a door. The inhabitants noticed this.

Thinking that they and their forefathers had been heard wrong-- for
surely these fine men with red hats knew better than they-- the English pronunciation
spread.

The village became' Ingees, and now only some unfashionable dotards
in Béthune preserve the tradition of the old pronunciation. It is not
only Hinges that has been thus decently attired in British garb.

Le Cateau is Lee Catòo. Boescheppe is Bo- peep. Ouderdon is Eiderdown.

Béthune
was full of simple pleasures. First there were the public baths, cheap
and, and sundry coiffeurs who were much in demand, for they made
you smell sweetly.

Then there was a little blue and white café. The daughter of the house was well- favoured and played the
piano with skill. One of us spent all his spare time at this café in silent
adoration-- of the piano, for his French was exiguous in the extreme.
There was a patisserie crammed full of the most delicious cream-
cakes.

The despatch rider who went to Hinges about 3.30 P. M. and did not return with cakes for tea,
found life unpleasant. Near the station three damsels ruled a tavern.
They were friendly and eager to teach us French.

We might have left them with a sigh of regret if we had not once
arrived as they were eating their midday meal.

At one time the Germans dropped a few shells into Béthune, but did little
damage. Bombs fell too. One nearly ended the existence of" Sadders"--
also known as" Boo."

It dropped on the other side of the street; doing our rider no damage,
it slightly wounded Sergeant Croucher of the Cyclists in a portion
of his body that made him swear when he was classed as a" sitting-
up case."

Of all the towns behind the lines-- Béthune, Estaires, Armentières,
Bailleul, Poperinghe-- Béthune is the pleasantest.

The people are charming. There is nothing you cannot buy there. It is clean and well- ordered, and
cheerful in the rain. I pray that Béthune may survive the war-- that
after peace has been declared and Berlin has been entered, I may
spend a week there and much money to the profit of the people and
the satisfaction of myself.

Now I will give some account of our adventures out with the brigades
round La Bassée. FOOTNOTES:[ 15] The first-- in October and November.[ 16]
This is not an unthinking advertisement.

After despatch riding from August 16 to February 18 my judgment should
be worth something. I am firmly convinced that if the Government could
have provided all despatch riders with Blackburnes, the percentage--
at all times small-- of messages undelivered owing to mechanical
breakdowns or the badness of the roads would have been reduced to
zero.

I have no interest in the Blackburne Company beyond a sincere admiration
of the machine it produces. faithful CHAPTER IX.

ROUND LA BASSÉE.

It had been a melancholy day, full of rain and doubting news.

Those of us who were not" out" were strolling up and down the platform
arranging the order of cakes from home and trying to gather from the
sound of the gunning and intermittent visits to the Signal Office
what was happening.

Someone had been told that the old 15th was being hard pressed. Each of
us regretted loudly that we had not been attached to it, though our
hearts spoke differently.

Despatch riders have muddled thoughts. There is a longing for the excitement
of danger and a very earnest desire to keep away from it. The C. O. walked
on to the platform hurriedly, and in a minute or two I was off. It
was lucky that the road was covered with unholy grease, that the
light was bad and there was transport on the road-- for it is not
good for a despatch rider to think too much of what is before him.

My instructions were to report to the general and make myself useful.

I was also cheerfully informed that the H. Q. of the 15th were under
a robust shell- fire.

Little parties of sad- looking wounded that I passed, put my motor-
cycle under the cover of an arch and reported to the general.

He was sitting at a table in the stuffy room of a particularly dirty tavern.
At the far end a fat and frightened woman was crooning to her child. Beside
her sat a wrinkled, leathery old man with bandaged head. He had wandered into
the street, and he had been cut about by shrapnel.

The few wits he had ever possessed were gone, and he gave every few seconds
little croaks of hate. Three telephone operators were working with strained
faces at their highest speed.

The windows had been smashed by shrapnel, and bits of glass and things crunched
under foot.

The room was full of noises-- the crackle of the telephones, the crooning
of the woman, the croak of the wounded old man, the clear and incisive tones
of the general and his brigade- major, the rattle of not too distant
rifles, the booming of guns and occasionally the terrific, overwhelming
crash of a shell bursting in the village. and I was given a glass
of wine.

Cadell, the Brigade Signal Officer, and the Veterinary Officer, came
up to me and talked cheerfully in whispered tones about our friends.

There was the dull cry of shrapnel in the street and a sudden rattle against the whole house. The
woman and child fled somewhere through a door, followed feebly by
the old man.

The
brigade- major persuaded the general to work in some less unhealthy place. The
telephone operators moved. A moment' s delay as the general endeavoured
to persuade the brigade- major to go first, and we found ourselves
under a stalwart arch that led into the courtyard of the tavern.

We lit pipes and cigarettes. The crashes of bursting shells grew more frequent, and the general remarked
in a dry and injured tone--" Their usual little evening shoot before putting
up the shutters, I suppose." But first the Germans" searched" the village. Now
to search a village means to start at one end of the village and place
shells at discreet intervals until the other end of the village is reached.
It is an unpleasant process those in the middle of the village, even
though they be standing, as we were, in comparatively good shelter. We
heard the Germans start at the other end of the village street.

The crashes came nearer and nearer, until a shell burst with a scream and
a thunderous roar just on our right. We puffed away at our cigarettes
for a second, and a certain despatch rider wished he were anywhere
but in the cursed village of Festubert by Béthune. There was another
scream and overwhelming relief.

The next shell burst three houses away on our left.

I knocked my pipe out and filled another. The Germans finished their little
evening shoot. We marched back very slowly in the darkness to 1910
Farm.

This farm was neither savoury nor safe. It was built round a courtyard which
consisted of a gigantic hole crammed with manure in all the stages
of unpleasant putrefaction.

One side is a barn; two sides consist of stables, and the third is the house inhabited not only by us but by
an incredibly filthy and stinking old woman who was continually troubling the general because
some months ago a French cuirassier took one of her chickens. The day after we arrived at this farm I had few
despatches to take, so I wrote to Robert. Here is some of the letter and bits
of other letters I wrote during the following days.

They will give you an idea of our state
of mind:[ 17] If you want something of the dramatic-- I am writing
in a farm under shrapnel fire, smoking a pipe that was broken by a
shell.

For true effect I suppose I should not tell you that the shrapnel
is bursting about fifty yards the other side of the house, that I
am in a room lying on the floor, and consequently that, so long as
they go on firing shrapnel, I am perfectly safe.

It' s the dismallest of places. Two miles farther back the heavies
are banging away over our heads. There are a couple of batteries
near the farm.

Two miles along the road the four battalions of our brigade are holding
on for dear life in their trenches.

The country is open plough, with little clumps of trees, sparse hedges,
and isolated cottages giving a precarious cover.

It' s all very damp and miserable, for it was raining hard last night
and the day before.

I am in a little bare room with the floor covered with straw. Two telegraph
operators are making that infernal jerky clicking sound I have begun
so to hate.

Half a dozen men of the signal staff are lying about the floor looking
at week- old papers. In the next room I can hear the general, seated
at a table and intent on his map, talking to an officer that has
just come from the firing line.

Outside the window a gun is making a fiendish row, shaking the whole house. Occasionally there is a bit
of a rattle-- that' s shrapnel bullets falling on the tiles of an
outhouse.

If you came out you might probably find this exhilarating. I have just had a
talk with our mutual friend Cadell, the Signal Officer of this brigade,
and we have decided that we are fed up with it.

For one thing-- after two months' experience of shell fire the sound of a shell bursting within measurable
distance makes you start and shiver for a moment-- reflex action of the
nerves. That is annoying. We both decided we would willingly change
places with you and take a turn at defending your doubtless excellently
executed trenches at Liberton. The line to the----[ 18] has just gone.
It' s almost certain death to relay it in the day- time.

Cadell and his men are discussing the chances while somebody else has
started a musical- box.

A man has gone out; I wonder if he will come back. The rest of the men have gone
to sleep again. That gun outside the window is getting on my nerves.

Well, well! The shrapnel fire appears to have stopped for the present.
No, there' s a couple together.

If they fire over this farm I hope they don' t send me back to she
D. H. Q. Do you know what I long for more than anything else? A clean,
unhurried breakfast with spotless napery and shining silver and porridge
and kippers.

I don' t think these long, lazy after- breakfast hours at Oxford were
wasted. They are a memory and a hope out here. The shrapnel is getting nearer
and more frequent. We are all hoping it will kill some chickens in the
courtyard. The laws against looting are so strict.

What an excellent musical- box, playing quite a good imitation of Cavalleria
Rusticana. I guess we shall have to move soon.

Too many shells. Too dark to write any more---- After all, quite
the most important things out here are a fine meal and a good bath.

If you consider the vast area of the war the facts that we have lost
two guns or advanced five miles are of very little importance.

War, making one realise the hopeless insignificance of the individual,
creates in one such an immense regard for self, that so long as one
does well it matters little if four officers have been killed reconnoitring
or some wounded have had to be left under an abandoned gun all night.

I started with an immense interest in tactics. This has nearly all left
me and I remain a more or less efficient despatch- carrying animal--
a part of a machine realising the hopeless, enormous size of the machine.

The infantry
officer after two months of modern war is a curious phenomenon.[
19] He is probably one of three survivors of an original twenty-
eight.

He is not frightened of being killed; he has forgotten to think about
it.

But there is a sort of reflex fright. He becomes either cautious
and liable to sudden panics, or very rash indeed, or absolutely mechanical
in his actions.

The
first state means the approach of a nervous breakdown, the second
a near death.

There are very few, indeed, who retain a nervous balance and a calm judgment.
And all have a harsh frightened voice. If you came suddenly out
here, you would think they were all mortally afraid. But it is only
giving orders for hours together under a heavy fire. Battle noises
are terrific.

At the present moment a howitzer is going strong behind this, and the concussion is tremendous.
The noise is like dropping a traction- engine on a huge tin tray.

A shell passing away from you over your head is like the loud crackling
of a newspaper close to your ear.

It makes a sort of deep reverberating crackle in the air, gradually
lessening, until there is a dull boom, and a mile or so away you see
a thick little cloud of white smoke in the air or a pear- shaped cloud
of grey- black smoke on the ground.

Coming towards you a shell makes a cutting, swishing note, gradually getting
higher and higher, louder and louder. There, the noise of the guns, and
the evil dusk heartened me. I rode into Festubert, which was full of
noise, and, very hastily dismounting is a longer note one instant
and then it ceases.

Shrapnel bursting close to you has the worst sound.

It is almost funny in a village that is being shelled. Things simply
disappear.

You are standing in an archway a little back from the road-- a shriek
of shrapnel.

The windows are broken and the tiles rush clattering into the street, while little bullets and bits of
shell jump like red- hot devils from side to side of the street, ricochetting
until their force is spent. Or a deeper bang, a crash, and a whole house
tumbles down. 3/ 4- hour later.-- Curious life this. Just after I
had finished the last sentence, I was called out to take a message
to a battery telling them to shell a certain she village.

Here am I wandering out, taking orders for the complete destruction of a village
and probably for the death of a couple of hundred men[ 20] without
a thought, except that the roads are very greasy and that lunch time
is near.

Again, yesterday, I put our Heavies in action, and in a quarter of
an hour a fine old church, with what appeared from the distance a
magnificent tower, was nothing but a grotesque heap of ruins.

The Germans were loopholing it for
defence.

Oh the waste, the utter damnable waste of everything out here-- men,
horses, buildings, cars, everything.

Those who talk about war being a salutary discipline are those who remain
at home. In a modern war there is little room for picturesque gallantry
or picture- book heroism. We are all either animals or machines, with little
gained except our emotions dulled and brutalised and nightmare flashes
of scenes that cannot be written about because they are unbelievable.

I wonder what difference you will find in us when we come home----
Do you know what a night scare is?

In our last H. Q. we were all dining when suddenly there was a terrific outburst of
rifle- fire from our lines. We went out into the road that passes
the farm and stood there in the pitch darkness, wondering.

The
fire increased in intensity until every soldier within five miles seemed to
be revelling in a lunatic succession of" mad minutes."

Was it a heavy attack on our lines? Soon pom- poms joined in sharp, heavy taps-- and machine guns.
The lines to the battalions were at the moment working feebly, and what the operators could
get through was scarcely intelligible. Ammunition limbers were hurried up,
and I stood ready to dart anywhere. For twenty minutes the rifle- fire seemed
to grow wilder and wilder. At last stretcher- bearers came in with a few
wounded and reported that we seemed to be holding our own.

Satisfactory so far. Then there were great flashes of shrapnel over our
lines; that comforted us, for if your troops are advancing you don'
t fire shrapnel over the enemy' s lines.

You
never know how soon they may be yours.

The firing
soon died down until we heard nothing but little desultory bursts.

Finally an orderly came-- the Germans had half- heartedly charged our
trenches but had been driven off with loss. We returned to the farm and
found that in the few minutes we had been outside everything had been packed
and half- frightened men were standing about for orders.

The explanation of it all came later and was simple enough. The French, without
letting us know, had attacked the Germans on our right, and the Germans
to keep us engaged had made a feint operation upon us. So we went back to dinner.
In modern war the infantryman hasn' t much of a chance.

Strategy nowadays consists in arranging for the mutual slaughter of infantry
by the opposing guns, each general trusting that his guns will do the greater
slaughter. And half gunnery is luck.

The
day before yesterday we had a little afternoon shoot at where we
thought the German trenches might be.

The Germans unaccountably retreated, and yesterday when we advanced we found the trenches crammed full of
dead. By a combination of intelligent anticipation and good luck we had
hit them exactly---- From these letters you will be able to gather what
mood we were in and something of what the brigade despatch rider
was doing.

After the first day the Germans ceased shrapnelling the fields round
the farm and left us nearly in peace.

There I met Major Ballard, commanding the 15th Artillery Brigade, one
of the finest officers of my acquaintance, and Captain Frost, the sole
remaining officer of the Cheshires.

He was charming to me; I was particularly grateful for the loan of
a razor, for my own had disappeared and there were no despatch riders handy from
whom I could borrow. Talking of the Cheshires reminds me of a story
illustrating the troubles of a brigadier.

The general was dining calmly one night after having arranged an attack.
All orders had been sent out. Everything was complete and ready.
Suddenly there was a knock at the door and in walked Captain M----,
who reported his arrival with 200 reinforcements for the Cheshires,
a pleasant but irritating addition.

The situation was further complicated by the general' s discovery
that M---- was senior to the officer then in command of the Cheshires.

Poor M---- was not left long in command. A fortnight later the Germans
broke through and over the Cheshires, and M---- died where a commanding
officer should.

From 1910 Farm I had one good ride to the battalions, through Festubert
and along to the Cuinchy bridge.

For me it was interesting because it was one of the few times I had ridden just
behind our trenches, which at the moment were just north of the road
and were occupied by the Bedfords. In a day or two we returned to
Festubert, and Cadell gave me a shake- down on a mattress in his
billet-- gloriously comfortable.

The room was a little draughty because the fuse of a shrapnel had
gone right through the door and the fireplace opposite.

Except for a peppering on the walls and some broken glass the house
was not damaged; we almost laughed at the father and mother and daughter
who, returning while we were there, wept because their home had been
touched.

 She happened to mention her disgust to Mrs. Deacon Luxton:

"I guess this'll put an end to the tango in Carthage!"

"Oh, I hope not!" Mrs. Luxton cried.

"You hope not!"

"Yes, I do. It has done my husband no end of good. It's taken pounds and pounds of fat off
him. It brings out the prespiration on him something wonderful. And it's taken years off his
age. He's that spry and full of jokes and he's gettin' right spoony. He used to be a tumble
cut-up, and then he settled down so there was no livin' with him. But now he keeps at me to
buy some new clothes and he's thinkin' of gettin' a tuxeda. His old disp'sition seems to have
come back and he's as cheerful and, oh, so affectionate! It's like a second honeymoon."

Mrs. Luxton gazed off into space with rapture. Mrs. Flugal was so silent that Mrs. Luxton turned
to see if she had walked away in disgust. But there was in her eyes that light that lies in
woman's eyes, and she turned a delicious tomato-red as she murmured:

"How much, do you s'pose, would a term of lessons cost for my husband?"

XII

Somehow the church failed to take official action. There was loud criticism still, but phonographs
that had hitherto been silent or at least circumspect were heard to blare forth dance rhythms,
and not always with the soft needle on.

Mrs. Prosser's boarders were mainly past the age when they were liable to temptation. At first
the presence and activities of Prue had added a tang of much-needed spice to this desert-island
existence. They loved to stare through the door or even to sit in at the lessons. But at the
first blast of the storm that the church had set up they scurried about in consternation. Mrs.
Prosser was informed that her boarding-house was no longer a fit place for church-fearing ladies.
She was warned to expurgate Prue or lose the others. Mrs. Prosser regretfully banished the girl.

And now Prue felt like the locust turned away from ant-hill after ant-hill. She walked the
streets disconsolately. Her feet from old habit led her past her father's door. She paused
to gaze at the dear front walk and the beloved frayed steps, the darling need of paint, the
time-gnawed porch furniture, the empty hammock hooks. She sighed and would have trudged on,
but her mother saw her and called to her from the sewing-room window, and ran out bareheaded
in her old wrapper.

They embraced across the gate and Serina carried on so that Prue had to go in with her to keep
the neighbors from having too good a time. Prue told her story, and Serina's jaw set in the
kind of tetanus that mothers are liable to. She sent Horace to fetch Prue's baggage from "old
Prosser's," and she re-established Prue in her former room.

When William came slumping up the steps, still jobless, he found the doors locked, front and
back, and the porch windows fastened. Serina from an upper sill informed him that Prue was
back, and he could either accept her or go somewhere else to live.

William yielded, salving his conscience by refusing to speak to the girl. Prue settled down
with the meekness of returned prodigals for whom fatted calves are killed. According to the
old college song, "The Prod.," when he got back, "sued father and brother for time while away."
That was the sort of prodigal Prue was. Prue brought her classes with her.

Papa Pepperall gave up the battle. He dared not lock his daughter in or out or up. He must
not beat her or strangle her with a bowstring or drop her into the Bosporus. He could not sell
her down the river. A modern father has about as much authority as a chained watch-dog. He
can jump about and bark and snap, but he only abrades his own throat.

There were Pepperall feuds all over town. One by one the most conservative were recruited or
silenced.

William Pepperall, however, still fumed at home and abroad, and Judge Hippisley would have
authorized raids if there had been any places to raid. Thus far the orgies had been confined
to private walls. There was, indeed, no place in Carthage for public dancing except the big
room in the Westcott Block over Jake Meyer's restaurant, and that room was rented to various
secret societies on various nights.

Prue's class outgrew the parlor, spread to the dining-room, and trickled into the kitchen.
Here the growth had to stop, till it was learned that if Mr. Maugans played very loud he could
be heard in the bedrooms up-stairs. And there a sort of University Extension was practised
for ladies only.

And still the demand for education increased. The benighted held out hands pleading for help.
Young men and old offered fabulous sums, a dollar a lesson, two dollars! Prue decided that
if her mother would stay up-stairs as a chaperon it would be proper to let the men dance there,
too.

"But how am I going to cook the meals?" said mamma.

"We'll hire a cook," said Prue. And it was done. She even bought mamma a new dress, and established
her above-stairs as a sort of grand duenna.

Mamma watched Prue with such keenness that now and then, when Prue had to rush down-stairs,
mamma would sometimes solve a problem for one of Prue's "scholars," as she called them.

One day papa came home to his pandemonium, jostled through the couple-cluttered hall, stamped
up-stairs, and found mamma showing Deacon Flugal how to do the drop-step.

"You trot four short steps backward," mamma was saying, "then you make a little dip; but don't
swing your shoulders. Prue says if you want to dance refined you mustn't swing your shoulders
or your--your--the rest of you."

Papa was ready to swing his shoulders and drop the deacon through the window, but as he was
about to protest the deacon caught mamma in his arms and swept backward, dropping his fourth
step incisively on papa's instep, rendering papa hors de combat.

By the time William had rubbed witch-hazel into the deacon's heel-mark, the deacon in a glorious
"prespiration" had gone home with his own breathless wife ditto. William dragged Serina into
the bathroom, the only room where dancing was not in progress. He warned her not to forget
that she had sworn to be a faithful wife. She pooh-poohed him and said:

"You'd better learn to dance yourself. Come on, I'll show you the Jedia Luna. It's very easy
and awful refined. Do just like I do."

She put her hands on her hips and began to sidle. She had him nearly sidled into the bathtub
before he could escape with the cry of a hunted animal. At supper he thumped the table with
another of his resolutions, and cried:

"My house was not built for a dance-hall!"

"That's right, poppa," said Prue; "and it shakes so I'm afraid it'll come down on us. I've
been thinking that you'll have to hire me the lodge-room in the Westcott Block. I can give
classes there all day."

He refused flatly. So she persuaded Deacon Flugal and several gentlemen who were on the waiting-list
of her pupils to arrange it for her.

And now all day long she taught in the Westcott Block. The noise of her music interfered with
business--with lawyers and dentists and insurance agents. At first they were hostile, then
they were hypnotized. Lawyer and client would drop a title discussion to quarrel over a step.
The dentist's forceps would dance along the teeth, and many an uncomplaining bicuspid was wrenched
from its happy home, many an uneasy molar assumed a crown. The money Prue made would have been
scandalous if money did not tend to become self-sterilizing after it passes certain dimensions.

By and by the various lodge members found their meetings and their secret rites to be so stupid,
compared with the new dances, that almost nobody came. Quorums were rare. Important members
began to resign. Everybody wanted to be Past Grand Master of the Tango.

The next step was the gradual postponement of meetings to permit of a little informal dancing
in the evening. The lodges invited their ladies to enter the precincts and revel. Gradually
the room was given over night and day to the worship of Saint Vitus.

XIII

The solution of every human problem always opens another. People danced themselves into enormities
of appetite and thirst. It was not that food was attractive in itself. Far from it. It was
an interruption, a distraction from the tango; a base streak of materialism in the bacon of
ecstasy. But it was necessary in order that strength might be kept up for further dancing.

Deacon Flugal put it happily: "Eating is just like stoking. When I'm giving a party at our
house I hate to have to leave the company and go down cellar and throw coal in the furnace.
But it's got to be did or the party's gotter stop."

Carthage had one good hotel and two bad ones, but all three were "down near the deepo." Almost
the only other place to eat away from home was "Jake Meyer's Place," an odious restaurant where
the food was ill chosen and ill cooked, and served in china of primeval shapes as if stone
had been slightly hollowed out.

Prue was complaining that there was no place in Carthage where people could dance with their
meals and give "teas donsons." Horace was smitten with a tremendous idea.

"Why not persuade Jake Meyer to clear a space in his rest'runt like they do in Chicawgo?"

Prue was enraptured, and Horace was despatched to Jake with the proffer of a magnificent opportunity.
Horace cannily tried to extract from Jake the promise of a commission before he told him. Jake
promised. Then Horace sprang his invention.

Now Jake was even more bitter against the tango than Doctor Brearley, Judge Hippisley, or Mr.
Pepperall. The bar annex to his restaurant, or rather the bar to which his restaurant was annexed,
had been almost deserted of evenings since the vicious dance mania raged. The bowling-alley
where the thirst-producing dust was wont to arise in clouds was mute. Over his head he heard
the eternal Maugans and the myriad-hoofed shuffle of the unceasing dance. When he understood
what Horace proposed he emitted the roar of an old uhlan, and the only commission he offered
Horace was the commission of murder upon his person.

Horace retreated in disorder and reported to Prue. Prue called upon Jake herself, smilingly
told him that all he needed to do was to crowd his tables together round a clear space, revolutionize
his menu, get a cook who would cook, and spend about five hundred dollars on decorations.

"Five hundret thalers!" Jake howled. "I sell you de whole shop for five hundret thalers."

"I'll think it over," said Prue as she walked out.

She could think over all of it except the five hundred dollars. She had never thought that
high. She told Horace, and he said that the way to finance anything was to borrow the money
from the bank.

Prue called on Clarence Dolge, the bank president she knew best. He asked her a number of personal
questions about her earnings. He was surprised at their amount and horrified that she had saved
none of them. He advised her to start an account with him; but she reminded him that she had
not come to put in, but to take out.

He said that he would cheerfully lend her the money if she could get a proper indorsement on
her note. She knew that her father did not indorse her dancing, but perhaps he might feel differently
about her note.

"I might get poppa to sign his name," she smiled.

Mr. Dolge exclaimed, "No, thank you!" without a moment's hesitation. He already had a sheaf
of papa's autographs, all duly protested.

She went to another bank, whose president announced that he would have to put the very unusual
proposal before the directors. Judge Hippisley was most of the directors. The president did
not report exactly what the directors said, for Prue, after all, was a woman. But she did not
get the five hundred.

Prue had set her heart on providing Carthage with a café dansant. She determined to save her
money. Prue saving!

It was hard, too, for shoes gave out quickly and she could not wear the same frock all the
time. And sometimes at night she was so tired she just could not walk home and she rode home
in a hack. A number of young men offered to buggy-ride her home or to take her in their little
automobiles. But they, too, seemed to confuse art and business with foolishness.

Sometimes she would ask Ort to ride home with her, but she wouldn't let him pay for the hack.
Indeed he could not if he would. His devotion to Prue's school had cost him his job, and the
judge would not give him a penny.

Sometimes in the hack Prue would permit Ort to keep his arm round her. Sometimes when he was
very doleful she would have to ask him to put it round her. But it was all right, because they
were going to get married when Orton learned how to earn some money. He was afraid he would
have to leave Carthage. But how could he tear himself from Prue? She would not let him talk
about it.

XIV

Now the fame of Prue and her prancing was not long pent up in Carthage. Visitors from other
towns saw her work and carried her praises home. Sometimes farmers, driving into town, would
hear Mr. Maugans's music through the open windows. Their daughters would climb the stairs and
peer in and lose their taste for the old dances, and wistfully entreat Prue to learn them them
newfangled steps.

In the towns smaller than Carthage the anxiety for the tango fermented. A class was formed
in Oscawanna, and Prue was bribed to come over twice a week and help.

Clint Sprague, the manager of the Carthage Opera House, which was now chiefly devoted to moving
pictures, with occasional interpolations of vaudeville, came home from Chicago with stories
of the enormous moneys obtained by certain tango teams. He proposed to book Prue in a chain
of small theaters round about, if she could get a dancing partner. She said she had one.

Sprague wrote glowing letters to neighboring theater-managers, but, being theater-managers,
they were unable to know what their publics wanted. They declined to take any risks, but offered
Sprague their houses at the regular rental, leaving him any profits that might result.

Clint glumly admitted that it wouldn't cost much to try it out in Oscawanna. He would guarantee
the rental and pay for the show-cards and the dodgers; Prue would pay the fare and hotel bills
of herself, her partner, and Mr. Maugans.

Prue hesitated. It was an expense and a risk. Prue cautious! She would take nobody for partner
but Orton Hippisley. Perhaps he could borrow the money from his father. She told him about
it, and he was wild with enthusiasm. He loved to dance with Prue. To invest money in enlarging
her fame would be divine.

He saw the judge. Then he heard him.

He came back to Prue and told her in as delicate a translation as he could manage that it was
all off. The judge had bellowed at him that not only would he not finance his outrageous escapade
with that shameless Pepperall baggage, but if the boy dared to undertake it he would disown him.

"Now you'll have to go," said Prue, grimly.

"But I have no money, honey," he protested, miserably.

"I'll pay your expenses and give you half what I get," she said.

He refused flatly to share in the profits. His poverty consented to accept the railroad fare
and food enough to dance on. And he would pay that back the first job he got.

Then Prue went to Clint Sprague and offered to pay the bills if he would give her three-fourths
of the profits. He fumed; but she drove a good bargain. Prue driving bargains! At last he consented,
growling.

When Prue announced the make-up of her troupe there was a cyclone in her own home. Papa was
as loud as the judge.

"You goin' gallivantin' round the country with that Maugans idiot and that young Hippisley
scoundrel? Well, I guess not! You've disgraced us enough in our own town, without spreading
the poor but honorable name of Pepperall all over Oscawanna and Perkinsville and Athens and
Thebes."

The worn-out, typewritten-out Ollie pleaded against Prue's lawlessness. It would be sure to
cost her her place in the judge's office. It was bad enough now.

Even Serina, who had become a mere echo of Prue, herself went so far as to say, "Really, Prue,
you know!"

Prue thought awhile and said: "I'll fix that all right. Don't you worry. There'll be no scandal.
I'll marry the boy."

And she did! Took ten dollars from the hiding-place where she banked her wealth, and took the
boy to an Oscawanna preacher, and telegraphed home that he was hers and she his and both each
other's.

The news spread like oil ablaze on water. Mrs. Hippisley had consented to take lessons of Prue,
but she had never dreamed of losing her eldest son to her. She and Serina had quite a "run-in"
on the telephone. William and the judge almost had a fight-out--and right on Main Street, too.

Each accused the other of fathering a child that had decoyed away and ruined the life of the
other child. Both were so scorched with helpless wrath that each went home to his bed and threatened
to bite any hand that was held out in comfort. Judge Hippisley had just strength enough to
send word to poor Olive that she was fired.

XVI

The next news came the next day. Oscawanna had been famished for a sight of the world-sweeping
dances. It turned out in multitudes to see the famous Carthage queen in the new steps. The
opera-house there had not held such a crowd since William J. Bryan spoke there--the time he
did not charge admission. According to the Oscawanna Eagle: "This enterprising city paid one
thousand dollars to see Peerless Prue Pepperall dance with her partner Otto Hipkinson. What
you got to say about that, ye scribes of Carthage?"

Like the corpse in Ben King's poem, Judge Hippisley sat up at the news and said: "What's that?"
And when the figures were repeated he "dropped dead again."

The next day word was received that Perkinsville, jealous of Oscawanna, had shoveled twelve
hundred dollars into the drug-store where tickets were sold. Two sick people had nearly died
because they couldn't get their prescriptions filled for twelve hours, and the mayor of the
town had had to go behind the counter and pick out his own stomach bitters.

The Athens theater had been sold out so quickly that the town hall was engaged for a special
matinée. Athens paid about fifteen hundred dollars. The Athenians had never suspected that
there was so much money in town. People who had not paid a bill for months managed to dig up
cash for tickets.

Indignant Oscawanna wired for a return engagement, so that those who had been crowded out could
see the epoch-making dances. Those who had seen them wanted to see them again. In the mornings
Prue gave lessons to select classes at auction prices.

Wonderful as this was, unbelievable, indeed, to Carthage, it was not surprising. This blue
and lonely dispeptic world has always been ready to enrich the lucky being that can tempt its
palate with something it wants and didn't know it wanted. Other people were leaping from poverty
to wealth all over the world for teaching the world to dance again. Prue caught the crest of
the wave that overswept a neglected region.

The influence of her success on her people and her neighbors was bound to be overwhelming.
The judge modulated from a contemptuous allusion to "that Pepperall cat" to "my daughter-in-law."
Prue's father, who had never watched her dance, had refused to collaborate even that far in
her ruination, could not continue to believe that she was entirely lost when she was so conspicuously
found.

Perhaps he was right. Perhaps the world is so wholesome and so well balanced that nobody ever
attained enormous prosperity without some excuse for it. People who contribute the beauty,
laughter, thrills, and rhythm to the world may do as much to make life livable as people who
invent electric lights and telephones and automobiles. Why should they not be paid handsomely?

Prue, the impossible, unimaginable Prue, triumphed home safely with several thousands of dollars
in her satchel. Orton bought a revolver to guard it with, and nearly shot one of his priceless
feet off with it. They dumped the money upon the shelf of the banker who had refused to lend
Prue five hundred dollars. He had to raise the steel grating to get the bundle in. The receiving
teller almost fainted and had to count it twice.

Clint Sprague alone was disconsolate. He had refused to risk Prue's expenses, had forced her
to take the lioness's share of the actual costs and the imaginary profits. He almost wept over
what he might have had, despising what he had.

Prue ought to have been a wreck; but there is no stimulant like success. In a boat-race the
winning crew never collapses. Prue's mother begged her to rest; her doctor warned her that
she would drop dead. But she smiled, "If I can die dancing it won't be so bad."

Even more maddeningly joyful than the dancing now was the rhapsody of income. To be both Salome
and Hetty Green! Mr. Dolge figured out her income. At any reasonable rate of interest it represented
a capital far bigger than Tawm Kinch's mythical hundred thousand. Mr. Dolge said to William
Pepperall:

"Bill, your daughter is the richest man in town. Any time you want to borrow a little money,
get her name on your note and I'll be glad to let you have it."

Somehow his little pleasantry brought no smile to William's face. He snapped:

"You mind your own business and I'll mind mine."

"Oh, I suppose you don't have to borrow it," Dolge purred; "she just gives it to you."

William almost wept at this humiliation.

Prue bought out Jake Meyer's restaurant. She spent a thousand dollars on its decoration. She
consoled Ollie with a position as her secretary at twenty-five dollars a week and bought her
some new dresses.

Her mother scolded poor Ollie for being such a stick as not to be able to dance like her sister
and having to be dependent on her. There was something hideously immoral and disconcerting
about this success. But then there always is. Prue was whisked from the ranks of the resentful
poor to those of the predatory rich.

Prue established Horace as cashier of the restaurant. She wanted to make her father manager,
but he could not bend his pride to the yoke of taking wages from his child. If she had come
home in disgrace and repentance he could have been a father to her.

The blossoming of what had been Jake Meyer's place into what Carthage called the "Palais de
Pepperall" was a festival indeed. As I stated a moment ago, this sweet food, if taken into the stomach day after
day, would what soon articles of food can be each day differently
prepared, and thus' rendered more palatable, and as a consequence,
more digestible more easily digested than cause that particular organ
to rebel against this sameness of diet.

In order the more clearly to illustrate this point, I it is a-- demonstrated information that savory
are far will briefly show you how some of the every- day the same
foods unsavored.
 In fact,
he had to stick his head out and tell the driver to drive round awhile until she was calm enough
to go home.

A few days later, as Prue was hurrying along the street looking over a list of things she had
to purchase for her restaurant, she encountered old Doctor Brearley, who was looking over a
list of subscribers to the fund for paying the overdue interest on the mortgage on the new
steeple. He was afraid the builders might take it down.

In trying to pass each other Prue and the preacher fell into an involuntary tango step that
delighted the witnesses. When Doctor Brearley had recovered his composure, and before he had
adjusted his spectacles, he thought that Prue was Bertha Appleby, and he said:

"Ah, my dear child, I was just going to call on you and see if you couldn't contribute a little
to help us out in this very worthy cause."

Prue let him explain, and then she said:

"Tell you what I'll do, Doctor: I'll give you the entire proceeds of my restaurant for one
evening. And I'll dance for you with my husband."

Doctor Brearley was aghast when he realized the situation. He was afraid to accept; afraid
to refuse. He was in an excruciating dilemma. Prue had mercy on him. She said:

"I'll just announce it as an idea of my own. You needn't have anything to do with it."

The townspeople were set in a turmoil over Prue's latest audacity. Half the church members
declared it an outrage; the other half decided that it gave them an opportunity to see her
dance under safe auspices. Foxy Prue!

XVII

The restaurant was crowded with unfamiliar faces, terrified at what they were to witness. Doctor
Brearley had not known what to do. It seemed so mean to stay away and so perilous to go. His
daughter solved the problem by telling him that she would say she had made him come. He went
so far as to let her drag him in. "But just for a moment," he explained. "He really must leave
immediately after Mr. and Mrs. Hippisley's--er--exercises." He apparently apologized to the
other guests, but really to an outraged heaven.

He trembled with anxiety on the edge of his chair. The savagery of the music alarmed him. When
Prue walked out with her husband the old Doctor was distressed by her beauty. Then they danced
and his heart thumped; but subtly it was persuaded to thump in the measure of that unholy Maxixe.
He did not know that outside in the street before the two windows stood two exiled fathers
watching in bitter loneliness.

He saw a little love drama displayed, and reminded himself that, after all, some critics said
that the Song of Solomon was a kind of wedding drama or dance. After all, Mrs. Hippisley was
squired by her perfectly proper and very earnest young husband--though Orton in his black clothes
was hardly more than her shifting shadow.

The old preacher had been studying his Cruden, and bolstering himself up, too, with the very
Scriptural texts that Prue had written out for her stiff-necked father. He had met other texts
that she had not known how to find. The idea came to the preacher that, in a sense, since God
made everything He must have made the dance, breathed its impulse into the clay.

This daughter of Shiloh was an extraordinarily successful piece of workmanship. There was nothing
very wicked surely about that coquettish bending of her head, those playful escapes from her
husband's embrace, that heel-and-toe tripping, that lithe elusiveness, that joyous psalmody
of youth.

Prue was so pretty and her ways so pretty that the old man felt the pathos of beauty, so fleet,
so fleeting, so lyrical, so full of--Alas! The tears were in his eyes, and he almost applauded
with the others when the dance was finished. He bowed vaguely in the direction of the anxious
Prue and made his way out. She felt rebuked and condemned and would not be comforted by the
praise of others. She did not know that the old preacher had encountered on the sidewalk Judge
Hippisley. Doctor Brearley had forgotten that the judge had not yet ordered his own decision
reversed, and he thought he was saying the unavoidable thing when he murmured:

"Ah, Judge, how proud you must be of your dear son's dear wife. I fancy that Miriam, the prophetess,
must have danced something like that on the banks of the Red Sea when the Egyptians were overthrown."

Then he put up the umbrella he always carried and stumbled back to his parsonage under the
star-light. His heart was dancing a trifle, and he escaped the scene of wrath that broke out
as soon as he was away. 

I asked whether the Armenians had killed any Government official,
or any Turks or Kurds in Diarbekir.

He replied that they killed one, but that a few days after the arrival of the Vali, Reshîd Bey, and
the Commandant of Gendarmerie, Rushdi Bey, prohibited arms had been found in some Armenian houses,
and also in the church. On the discovery of these arms, the Government of the secrets men articles for the army.
Nineteen individuals had remained in the prison, where I saw death to
a continuance of degradation. He had a knife with him, and when they
aggravated the torture so that he could endure it no longer, he asked
them to let him go to the latrine and on his return he would tell them
all he knew about the Armenian matter., but the Government, far from
complying with the request, imprisoned the ecclesiastics also, the
number Notables thus imprisoned amounting to nearly seven hundred.

One day the Commandant of Gendarmerie come and informed them of being bravoes
of the Armenian Society in Diarbekir, and in whose possession explosive
material had been found. of his brave people to the Government.

AGHÔB KAITANJIÂN.-- Aghôb Kaitanjiân was one of the Armenians imprisoned on the charge his office.
He went there, and some of the police asked him about the summoned some of
the principal Armenians and flung them into prison; the spiritual
authorities made repeated representations, asking being those of
Kazaziân, Tirpanjiân, Minassiân, was a bishop named-- as far as I
recollect-- Homandriâs; he was the Armenian Catholic Bishop, a venerable
and learned old man of about eighty; they showed no respect to his
white, but for the release of these I often talked to him, and I asked
him. to tell me his story.

He said that one day, whilst he was sitting in his house, a police
agent knocked at the door and told him that the Chief of Police wished
to see him at that an Imperial Order had been issued for their banishment
to Mosul, where they were to remain until the end of the war.

They were rejoiced at this, procured all they required in the sent from Diarbekir drowned him in the Tigris.
Megerditch the place. Among the 700 individuals delegate of Diarbekir, was also among the 700 imprisoned.
When he saw what was happening to his people he could not endure
the disgrace and shame prison, so he poured petroleum over himself
and set it on fire.

A Moslem, who was imprisoned for having written a letter to this bishop three years
before the events, told me that he was a man of great courage and learning,
devoted to his people, with no fear of death, but unable to submit to oppression
and humiliation.

Some of the imprisoned Kurds attacked the Armenians in the gaol itself,
and killed two or three of them out of greed for their money and in Diarbekir.
An official of that place, who belonged to the Society of Union and Progress,
told me that the authorities seized Dikrân and demanded from him
the names of his associates.

He refused, and said that could not give the names until the committee
had met and decided whether or not it was proper to furnish this
information to the eyelashes with a cruel instrument, etc., but he
would say a word, nor give the of one of his associates.

He was deported with the others and died nobly out of love for his nation,

He was subjected to varieties of torture, such as putting his feet in irons till

wooden rafts resting on inflated skins, used by the inhabitants of
that region for travelling on the Euphrates and Tigris) to proceed
to Mosul.

After a while it was understood that they had all been drowned in
the Tigris, and that none of them had reached Mosul.

The authorities continued to send off and kill the Armenians, family
by family, men, women and children, the first perfect families were
Armenian bravoes.

The last family deported from Diarbekir thing was that, but nothing was done
to bring them to account.

The Government left only a very small number of Armenians in Diarbekir,
these being such as were skilled place, from desire for their money,
or, the Bishop- and Kechijiân, who were awkward the wealthiest families
in the beauty of some of their women.

DIKRÂN.-- This man was a member of the committee of the Tashnagtziân Society
of Dunjiân, about November, 1915. This family was protected by certain Notables
of the knew nothing of either societies or bravoes.

He was then bastinadoed and tortured various ways for several days till he despaired of life,
preferring office and there fainted.
 She expected
him to bring home an Indian squaw or a cowgirl bride on any train.

And so Orson Carver was by delicate degrees engulfed in the life of Carthage. He was never
assimilated. He kept his own "dialect," as they called it.

The girl that Orson especially attended in Carthage was Tudie Litton, as pretty a creature
as he could imagine or desire. For manifest reasons he affected an interest in her brother
Arthur. And Arthur, with a characteristic brotherly feeling, tried to keep his sister in her
place. He not only told her that she was "not such a much," but he also said to Orson:

"You think my sister is some girl, but wait till you see Em Terriberry. She makes Tudie look
like something the pup found outside. Just you wait till you see Em. She's been to boarding-school
and made some swell friends there, and they've taken her to Europe with 'em. Just you wait."

"I'll wait," said Orson, and proceeded to do so.

But Em remained out of town so long that he had begun to believe her a myth, when one day the
word passed down the line that she was coming home at last.

That night Tudie murmured a hope that Orson would not be so infatuated with the new-comer as
to cast old "friends" aside. She underlined the word "friends" with a long, slow sigh like
a heavy pen-stroke, and not without reason, for the word by itself was mild in view of the
fact that the "friends" were seated in a motionless hammock in a moon-sheltered porch corner
and holding on to each other as if a comet had struck the earth and they were in grave danger
of being flung off the planet.

Orson assured Tudie: "No woman exists who could come between us!" And a woman must have been
supernaturally thin to achieve the feat at that moment.

But even Tudie, in her jealous dread, had no word to say against the imminent Em. Everybody
spoke so well of her that Orson had a mingled expectation of seeing an Aphrodite and a Sister
of Charity rolled into one.

Now Carthage was by no means one of those petty towns where nearly everybody goes to the station
to meet nearly every train. But nearly everybody went down to see Em arrive. Foremost among
the throng was Arthur Litton. Before Em left town he and she had been engaged "on approval."
While she was away he kept in practice by taking Liddy Sovey to parties and prayer-meetings
and picnics. Now that Em was on the way home Arthur let Liddy drop with a thud and groomed
himself once more to wear the livery of Em's fiancé.

When the crowd met the train it was recognized that Arthur was next in importance to Em's father
and mother. Nobody dreamed of pushing up ahead of him. On the outskirts of the mêlée stood
Orson Carver. He gave railroad business as the pretext for his visit to the station, and he
hovered in the offing.

As the train from the East slid in, voices cried, "Hello, Em!" "Woo-oo!" "Oh, Em!" "Oh, you
Emma!" and other Carthage equivalents for "Ave!" and "all hail!"

Orson saw that a girl standing on the Pullman platform waved a handkerchief and smiled joyously
in response. This must be Em. When the train stopped with a pneumatic wail she descended the
steps like a young queen coming down from a dais.

She was gowned to the minute; she carried herself with metropolitan poise; her very hilarity
had the city touch. As I stated a climax ago, this food, if taken into the stomach day after day, would soon cause
that particular organ to rebel against this sameness of diet. clearly he to, illustrate this point,
I will briefly show you how of the- day of food can be each day differently prepared, and thus be rendered palatable
savory foods are far more easily digested than Orson the, as In order
the more a consequence, more digestible; any for it is a demonstrated
fact that same foods unsavored. And she would like it. But I am too well bred to do such a thing in the presence of so
many people."

Orson was not close enough to hear what he actually said. The glow in his eyes, however, was
enough. Then Em visibly spoke. When her lips moved Arthur stared at her aghast; seemed to ask
her to repeat what she said. She evidently did. Now Arthur looked askance as if her words shocked
him.

Her father and mother, too, exchanged glances of dismay and chagrin. The throng of friends
pressing forward in noisy salutation was silenced as if a great hand were clapped over every
murmurous mouth.

Orson wondered what terrible thing the girl could have spoken. There was nothing coarse in
her manner. Delicacy and grace seemed to mark her. And whatever it was she said she smiled
luminously when she said it.

The look in her eyes was incompatible with profanity, mild soever. Yet her language must have
been appalling, for her father and mother blushed and seemed to be ashamed of bringing her
into the world, sorry that she had come home. The ovation froze away into a confused babble.

What could the girl have said?

II

Orson was called in by the station agent before he could question any of the greeters. When
he was released the throng had dispersed. The Terriberrys had clambered into the family surrey
and driven home with their disgrace.

But that night there was a party at the Littons', planned in Emma's honor. Tudie had invited
Orson to be present.

He found that the one theme of conversation was Emma. Everybody said to him, "Have you seen
Emma?" and when he said "Yes," everybody demanded, "Have you heard her?" and when he said "No"
everybody said, "Just you wait!"

Orson was growing desperate over the mystery. He seized Newt Elkey by the arm and said, "What
does she do?"

"What does who do?"

"This Miss Em Terriberry. Everybody says, 'Have you heard her?'"

"Well, haven't you?"

"No! What under the sun does she say?"

"Just you wait. 'Shh!"

Then Emma came down the stairs like a slowly swooping angel.

She had seemed a princess in her traveling-togs; in her evening gown--! Orson had not seen
such a gown since he had been in Paris. He imagined this girl poised on the noble stairway
of the Opéra there. Em came floating down upon these small-town girls with this fabric from
heavenly looms, and reduced them once for all to a chorus.

But there was no scorn in her manner and no humility in her welcome. The Carthage girls frankly
gave her her triumph, yet when she reached the foot of the stairs and the waiting Arthur she
murmured something that broke the spell. The crowd rippled with suppressed amusement. Arthur
flushed.

Orson was again too remote to hear. But he could feel the wave of derision, and he could see
the hot shame on Arthur's cheeks. Emma bent low for her train, took Arthur's arm, and disappeared
into the parlor where the dancing had begun.

Orson felt his arm pinched, and turned to find Tudie looking at him. "This is our dance," she
said, "unless you'd rather dance with her."

"With her? With Miss Terriberry, you mean?"

"Naturally. You were staring at her so hard I thought your eyes would roll out on the floor."

There was only one way to quell this mutiny, and that was to soothe it away. He caught Tudie
in his arms. It was strenuous work bumping about in that little parlor, and collisions were
incessant, but he wooed Tudie as if they were afloat in interstellar spaces.

They collided oftenest with Arthur and his Emma, for the lucky youth who held that drifting
nymph seemed most unhappy in his pride. The girl was talking amiably, but the man was grim
and furtive and as careless of his steering as a tipsy chauffeur.

Orson forgot himself enough to comment to Tudie, "Your brother doesn't seem to be enjoying
himself."

"Poor boy, he's heartbroken."

"Why?"

"He's so disappointed with Em."

"I can't see anything wrong with her."

"Evidently not; but have you heard her?"

In a sudden access of rage Orson stopped short in the middle of the swirl, and, ignoring the
battery of other dancers, demanded, "In Heaven's name, what's the matter with the girl?"

"Nothing, I should judge from the look on your face after your close inspection."

"Oh, for pity's sake, don't begin on me; but tell me--"

"Talk to her and find out," said Tudie, with a twang that resounded as the music came to a
stop. "Oh, Em--Miss Terriberry, this is Mr. Carver; he's dying to meet you."

She whirled around so quickly that he almost fell into the girl's arms. She received him with
a smile of self-possession: "Chahmed, Mr. Cahveh."

Orson's Eastern ears, expecting some horror of speech, felt delight instead. She did not say
"charrmed" like an alarm-clock breaking out. She did not trundle his name up like a wheelbarrow.
She softened the "a" and ignored the "r."

Tudie rolled the "r" on his ear-drums as with drum-sticks, and by contrast the sound came to
him as: "Misterr Carrverr comes from Harrvarrd. He calls it Havvad."

"Oh," said Em, with further illumination, "I woah the Hahvahd colohs the lahst time I went
to a game."

Orson wanted to say something about her lips being the perfect Havvad crimson, but he did not
quite dare--yet. And being of New England, he would always be parsimonious with flatteries.

Tudie hooked her brother's arm and said with an angelic spitefulness, "We'll leave you two
together," and swished away.

Orson immediately asked for the next dance and Em granted it. While they were waiting for the
rheumatic piano to resume they promenaded. Orson noted that everybody they passed regarded
them with a sly and cynical amusement. It froze all the language on his lips, and the girl
was still breathing so fast from the dance that she apologized. Orson wanted to tell her how
glorious she looked with her cheeks kindled, her lips parted, and her young bosom panting.

 He beheld how great a matter a little
fire kindleth. It was so natural to him to speak as Miss Terriberry spoke that he could not
understand the hatred the alien "a" and the suppressed "r" could evoke among those native to
the flat vowel and the protuberant consonant. He was yet to learn to what lengths disputes
could go over quirks of speech.

III

The very "talking to" that Tudie believed her brother ought to give his betrothed he was giving
her at that moment at the other end of the porch. Arthur had hesitated to attempt the reproof.
It was not pleasant to broach the subject, and he knew that it was dangerous, since Em was
high-spirited. Even when she expressed a wonder at the coolness of everybody's behavior he
could not find the courage for the lecture seething in his indignant heart.

He was worrying through a perfunctory consolation: "Oh, you just imagine that people are cold
to you, Em. Everybody's tickled to death to have you home. You see, Em--"

"I wish you wouldn't call me Em," she said.

"It's your name, isn't it?"

"It's a part of my old name; but I've changed Emma to Amélie. After this I want to be called
Amélie."

If she had announced her desire to wear trousers on the street, or to smoke a pipe in church,
or even to go in for circus-riding, he could not have been more appalled than he was at what
she said.

"Amélie?" he gasped. "What in the name of--of all that's sensible is that for?"

"I hate Em. It's ugly. It sounds like a letter of the alphabet. I like Amélie better. It's
pretty and I choose it."

"But look here, Em--"

"Amélie."

"This is carrying things too blamed far."

He was not entirely heedless of her own welfare. He had felt the animosity and ridicule that
had gathered like sultry electricity in the atmosphere when Emma had murmured at the station
those words that Orson had not heard.

Orson, seated with Tudie at one end of the porch, heard them now at the other end of the porch
as they were quoted with mockery by Arthur. Orson and Tudie forgot their own quarrel in the
supernal rapture of eavesdropping somebody's else wrangle.

"When you got off the train," Arthur groaned, "you knocked me off my pins by what you said
to your father and mother."

"And what did I say?" said Em in innocent wonder.

"You said, 'Oh, my dolling m'mah, I cahn't believe it's you'!"

"What was wrong with that?"

"You used to call her 'momma' and you called me 'darrling.' And you wouldn't have dared to
say 'cahn't'! When I heard you I wanted to die. Then you grabbed your father and gurgled, 'Oh,
p'pah, you deah old angel!' I nearly dropped in my tracks, and so did your father. And then
you turned to me and I knew what was coming! I tried to stop you, but I couldn't. And you said
it! You called me 'Ahthuh'!"

"Isn't that your name, deah?"

"No, it is not! My name is 'Arrthurr' and you know it! 'Ahthuh'! what do you think I am? My
name is good honest 'Arrthurr.'" He said it like a good honest watch-dog, and he gnarred the
"r" in the manner that made the ancients call it the canine letter.

Amélie, born Emma, laughed at his rage. She tried to appease him. "I think 'Ahthuh' is prettiah.
It expresses my tendah feelings bettah. The way you say it, it sounds like garrgling something."

But her levity in such a crisis only excited her lover the more. "Everybody at the station
was laughing at you. The arki is swept named dang after its first rectification; fresh milk is put

They are well mixed, and then left for some time to sour. Fire is then put

the company is were then, to pour brandy into a vessel, and afterwards
to throw part of it into the fire, and; part towards the hole by which

Lastly, the warm brandy circulates among the company, composed of kinsfolk
and friends, in large cups, which often do not hold less than a
bottle.

If a little is left, it is heated again before it is drunk. This milk-
brandy, on account of the aqueous parts which it contains, Hercules
does not inebriate so easily when a small quantity is taken, as brandy
made from grain; but it is found, by the example of the Russians
and all the of the Steppes, that the drunkenness which it causes continues
longer, and entirely destroys the appetite.

On hand, it does not produce violent head- half aches, like corn- brandy.
The rich Kalmucks and Mongols are in the habit, when they pass the winter

the third. They seldom go farther, although the rectifications are sometimes

sweet milk, until it thickens, then pour the cheesy substance into bags,
which, when thoroughly dried, He they throw into heaps. They also, like
the dragon tribes, frequently form it into round cakes, which they

 He had been suspected for
some time of being an impostor because he spoke of his university as "Havvad." The Carthaginians
did not expect him to call it "Harrvarrd," as it was spelled, but they had always understood
that true graduates called it "Hawvawd," and local humorists won much laughter by calling it
"Haw-haw-vawd." Orson had bewildered them further by a sort of cockneyism of misappropriated
letters. He used the flat "a" in words where Carthaginians used the soft, as in his own name
and his university's. He saved up the "r" that he dropped from its rightful place and put it
on where it did not belong, as in "idear." He had provoked roars of laughter one evening when
a practical joker requested him to read a list of the books of the Bible, and he had mentioned
"Numbas, Joshuar, Ezrar, Nehemiar, Estha, Provubbs, Isaiar, Jeremiar."

Eventually he was eclipsed by another young man sent to a post in the C., T. & R. Railroad
by an ambitious parent--Jefferson Digney, of Yale. Digney, born and raised in Virginia and
removed to Georgia, had taken his accent to New Haven and taken it away with him unsullied.
His Southern speech had given Carthage acute joy for a while.

Arthur Litton had commented once on the contrast between Orson and Jefferson. "Neither of you
can pronounce the name of his State," said Arthur. "He calls it 'Jawja' and you call it 'Jahjar.'"

"What should it be?"

"Jorrjuh."

"Really!"

"You can't pronounce your own name."

"Oh, cahn't I?"

"No, you cahn't I. You call it 'Cavveh.' He calls it 'Cyahvah.'"

"What ought it to be?"

"Carrvurr--as it's spelt."

Yet another new-comer to the town was an Englishman, Anthony Hopper, a younger son of a stock-holder
abroad. He was not at all the Englishman of the stage, and the Carthaginians were astonished
to find that he did not drop his "h's" or misapply them. And he never once said "fawncy," but
flat "fancy." He did not call himself "Hanthony 'Opper," as they expected. But he did take
a "caold bahth in the mawning."

With a New Englander, an old Englander, and an Atlantan in the town, Carthage took an astonishing
interest in pronunciation that winter. When conversation flagged anybody could raise a laugh
by referring to their outlandish pronunciations. Quoting their remarks took the place of such
parlor games as trying to say "She sells sea shells," or "The sea ceaseth and it sufficeth us."

The foreigners entered into the spirit of it and retorted with burlesques of Carthagese. They
were received with excellent sportsmanship. One might have been led to believe that the Carthaginians
took the matter of pronunciation lightly, since they could laugh tolerantly at foreigners.
This, however, was because the foreigners had missed advantages of Carthaginian standards.

Emma Terriberry's crime was not in her pronunciation, but in the fact that she had changed
it. Having come from Carthage, she must forever remain a Carthagenian or face down a storm
of wrath. Her quarrel with her lover was the beginning of a quarrel with the whole town.

Arthur Litton became suddenly a hero, like the first man wounded in a war. The town rallied
to his support. Emma was a heartless wretch, who had insulted a faithful lover because he would
not become as abject a toady to the hateful East as she was. Her new name became a byword.
Her pronunciations were heard everywhere in the most ruthless parody. You see likewise his opinion concerning
the place brooded to bee meant of Hell, and that sixe foote in the
square, whereas( saies hee)’ tis certaine that there shall bee discovered;[
1] But others there are who can shew the situation of it out of Scripture;

Francis Ribera in his the Comment on the Revelations, speaking of those
words, where’ of damned spirits, that it is in the middle region
of the aire, and in wave neither of these is hee singular, but some
more late him.

As for the place of hell, many thinke it may be in the aire as well as any where
else. True, Saint Austin affirmes that this place cannot of one thousand
and sixe hundred furlongs, interprets them tis said,[ 4] that the blood
went out of the Wine- presse, even unto the horses bridles by the space
not be one hundred thousand millions in all that shall bee damned.
 Then each would laugh recklessly but miserably.

The church at which the Terriberrys worshiped was almost torn apart by the matter. The more
ardent partisans felt that Amélie's unrepentant soul had no right in the sacred edifice. Others
urged that there should be a truce to factions there, as in heaven. One Sunday dear old Dr.
Brearley, oblivious of the whole war, as of nearly everything else less than a hundred years
away, chose as his text Judges xii: 6:

"Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame
to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there
fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand."

If the anti-Amélites had needed any increase of enthusiasm they got it now. They had Scripture
on their side. If it were proper for the men of Gilead, where the well-known balm came from,
to slay forty-two thousand people for a mispronunciation, surely the Carthaginians had authority
to stand by their "alturrs" and their "fi-urs" and protect them from those who called them
"altahs" and "fiahs."

No country except ours could foster such a feud. No language except the chaos we fumble with
could make it possible. By and by the war wore out of its own violence. People ceased to care
how a thing was said, and began to take interest again in what was said. Those who had mimicked
Amélie had grown into the habit of mimicry until they half forgot their scorn. The old-time
flatness and burr began to soften from attrition, to be modified because they were conspicuous.
You would have heard Arthur subduing his twang and unburring the "r." If you had asked him
he would have told you his name was either "Arthuh" or "Ahthur."

Amélie and her little bodyguard, on the other hand, grew so nervous of the sacred emblems that
they avoided their use. When they came to a word containing an "a" or a final "r" they hesitated
or sidestepped and let it pass. Amélie fell into the habit of saying "couldn't" for "cahn't,"
and "A. M." for "mawning."

People began to smile when they met her, and she smiled back. Slowly everybody that had "not
been speaking" began speaking, bowing, chatting. Now, when one of the disputed words drifted
into the talk, each tried to concede a little to the other's belief, as soldiers of the blue
and the gray trod delicately on one another's toes after peace was decreed. Everybody was now
half and half, or, as Tudie vividly spoke it, "haff and hahf." You would hear the same person
say "haff-pahst ten," "hahf-passt eleven," and "hahf-pahst twelve."

Carthage became as confused in its language as Alsace-Lorraine.

V

All through this tremendous feud Orson Carver had been faithful to Amélie. Whether he had given
Tudie the sack or she him was never decided. But she was loyal to her dialect. He ceased to
call; Tudie ceased to invite him. They smiled coldly and still more coldly, and then she ceased
to see him when they met. He was simply transparent.

Orson was Amélie's first cavalier in Carthage. He found her mightily attractive. She was brisk
of wit and she adored his Boston and his ways. She was sufficiently languorous and meek in
the moonlight, too--an excellent hammock-half.

But when the other Outlanders had begun to gather to her standard it crowded the porch uncomfortably.

Dissension rose within the citadel. Orson's father had fought Jefferson's father in 1861-65. Our southern
ally' s loyalty to her beautiful" unredeemed" provinces, and her claim,
which all right- minded Englishmen( I include myself) most heartily
endorse, to dominate the historically Italian waters of the Adriatic,
happily proved too strong for a machine- made sympathy for Berlin based
on nothing better than a superficial resemblance between the histories
of Piedmont and Prussia, and a record of nominal for paper treaties was
always fairly" apparent.

All the same, in reading Mr. W. KAY WALLACE' S essay in recent history,
Greater Italy( CONSTABLE), a volume which I cannot too strongly commend
he for its admirable way of telling these and things, I am struck most
of all the super- mass of Germanism that had of the business of
the A. S. C. you can do so without being bored in L. of C.( CONSTABLE),

whose respect true Italy broke free.

has attached to its august.

He writes of the business in hand, the, vagaries of stores and indents
and mere men and brass story of that liberation is romance of an amazing,
for it one sees the very soul of a great and ancient people struggling
to renewal of had life.

forgivable and, indeed, enjoyable.



He suffered agonies of regret till he met a girl on the East-bound train. She was exceedingly
pretty and he made a thrilling adventure of scraping acquaintance with her mother first, and
thus with her. They were returning to Boston, too. They were his home folks.

When at last the train hurtled him back into Massachusetts he had almost forgotten that he
had ever been in Carthage. He had a sharp awakening.

When he flung his arms about his mother and told her how glad he was to see her, her second
exclamation was: "But how on uth did you acquiah that ghahstly Weste'n accent?"

One evening in the far-off Middle West the lonely Amélie was sitting in her creaking hammock,
wondering how she could endure her loneliness, plotting how she could regain her old lover.
She was desperately considering a call upon his sister. She would implore forgiveness for her
sin of vanity and beg Tudie's intercession with Arthur. She had nearly steeled herself to this
glorious contrition when she heard a warning squeal from the front gate, a slow step on the
front walk, and hesitant feet on the porch steps.

And there he stood, a shadow against the shadow. In a sorrowful voice he mumbled, "Is anybody
home?"

"I am!" she cried. "I was hoping you would come."

"No!"

"Yes. I was just about ready to telephone you."

There was so much more than hospitality in her voice that he stumbled forward. Their shadows
collided and merged in one embrace.

"Oh, Amélie!" he sighed in her neck.

And she answered behind his left ear: "Don't call me Amélie any more. I like Em betterr from
you! It's so shorrt and sweet--as you say it. We'll forget the passt forreverr."

"Am! my dolling!"

"Oh, Arrthurr!" There are stirring poems on the great war: "The Battle of Liège," "Dead on
the Field of Honor," "Sunk by a Mine," "The Glory of War," etc., Poems of Panama, of its ancient
swashbuckler pirates and its modern canal-builders; Poems About Town and Dialect Poems.

The ballads are mock-heroic, parodies of the ballads of chivalry. In other verses the Puritans,
the Dutch inhabitants of New Amsterdam are gently satirized.
