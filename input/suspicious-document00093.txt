ROLF IN THE WOODS

By Ernest Thompson Seton

[Chapters 10 and 60 not designated in the original file.]

Preface

In this story I have endeavoured to realize some of the influences that surrounded the youth
of America a hundred years ago, and made of them, first, good citizens, and, later, in the
day of peril, heroes that won the battles of Lake Erie, Plattsburg, and New Orleans, and the
great sea fights of Porter, Bainbridge, Decatur, Lawrence, Perry, and MacDonough.

I have especially dwelt in detail on the woodland and peace scouting in the hope that I may
thus help other boys to follow the hard-climbing trail that leads to the higher uplands.

For the historical events of 1812-14, I have consulted among books chiefly, Theodore Roosevelt's
"Naval War of 1812," Peter S. Palmer's "History of Lake Champlain," and Walter Hill Crockett's
"A History of Lake Champlain," 1909. But I found another and more personal mine of information.
Through the kindness of my friend, Edmund Seymour, a native of the Champlain region, now a
resident of New York, I went over all the historical ground with several unpublished manuscripts
for guides, and heard from the children of the sturdy frontiersmen new tales of the war; and
in getting more light and vivid personal memories, I was glad, indeed, to realize that not
only were there valour and heroism on both sides, but also gentleness and courtesy. Histories
written by either party at the time should be laid aside. They breathe the rancourous hate
of the writers of the age--the fighters felt not so--and the many incidents given here of chivalry
and consideration were actual happenings, related to me by the descendants of those who experienced
them; and all assure me that these were a true reflex of the feelings of the day.

I am much indebted to Miss Katherine Palmer, of Plattsburg, for kindly allowing me to see the
unpublished manuscript memoir of her grandfather, Peter Sailly, who was Collector of the Port
of Plattsburg at the time of the war.

Another purpose in this story was to picture the real Indian with his message for good or for evil.

Those who know nothing of the race will scoff and say they never heard of such a thing as a
singing and religious red man. Those who know him well will say, "Yes, but you have given to
your eastern Indian songs and ceremonies which belong to the western tribes, and which are
of different epochs." To the latter I reply:

"You know that the western Indians sang and prayed in this way. How do you know that the eastern
ones did not? We have no records, except those by critics, savagely hostile, and contemptuous
of all religious observances but their own. The Ghost Dance Song belonged to a much more recent
time, no doubt, but it was purely Indian, and it is generally admitted that the races of continental
North America were of one stock, and had no fundamentally different customs or modes of thought."

The Sunrise Song was given me by Frederick R. Burton, author of "American Primitive Music."
It is still in use among the Ojibwa.

The songs of the Wabanaki may be read in C. G. Leland's "Kuloskap the Master."

The Ghost Dance Song was furnished by Alice C. Fletcher, whose "Indian Song and Story" will
prove a revelation to those who wish to follow further.

Chapter 1. The Wigwam Under the Rock

The early springtime sunrise was near at hand as Quonab, the last of the Myanos Sinawa, stepped
from his sheltered wigwam under the cliff that borders the Asamuk easterly, and, mounting to
the lofty brow of the great rock that is its highest pinnacle, he stood in silence, awaiting
the first ray of the sun over the sea water that stretches between Connecticut and Seawanaky.

His silent prayer to the Great Spirit was ended as a golden beam shot from a long, low cloud-bank
over the sea, and Quonab sang a weird Indian song for the rising sun, an invocation to the Day God:

     "O thou that risest from the low cloud
     To burn in the all above;
     I greet thee!  I adore thee!"

Again and again he sang to the tumming of a small tom-tom, till the great refulgent one had
cleared the cloud, and the red miracle of the sunrise was complete. Back to his wigwam went
the red man, down to his home tucked dosed under the sheltering rock, and, after washing his
hands in a basswood bowl, began to prepare his simple meal.

A tin-lined copper pot hanging over the fire was partly filled with water; then, when it was
boiling, some samp or powdered corn and some clams were stirred in. While these were cooking,
he took his smooth-bore flint-lock, crawled gently over the ridge that screened his wigwam
from the northwest wind, and peered with hawk-like eyes across the broad sheet of water that,
held by a high beaver-dam, filled the little valley of Asamuk Brook.

The winter ice was still on the pond, but in all the warming shallows there was open water,
on which were likely to be ducks. None were to be seen, but by the edge of the ice was a round
object which, although so far away, he knew at a glance for a muskrat.

By crawling around the pond, the Indian could easily have come within shot, but he returned
at once to his wigwam, where he exchanged his gun for the weapons of his fathers, a bow and
arrows, and a long fish-line. A short, quick stalk, and the muskrat, still eating a flagroot,
was within thirty feet. The fish-line was coiled on the ground and then attached to an arrow,
the bow bent--zip--the arrow picked up the line, coil after coil, and trans-fixed the muskrat.
Splash! and the animal was gone under the ice.

But the cord was in the hands of the hunter; a little gentle pulling and the rat came to view,
to be despatched with a stick and secured. Had he shot it with a gun, it had surely been lost.

He returned to his camp, ate his frugal breakfast, and fed a small, wolfish-looking yellow
dog that was tied in the lodge.

He skinned the muskrat carefully, first cutting a slit across the rear and then turning the
skin back like a glove, till it was off to the snout; a bent stick thrust into this held it
stretched, till in a day, it was dry and ready for market. The body, carefully cleaned, he
hung in the shade to furnish another meal.

As he worked, there were sounds of trampling in the woods, and presently a tall, rough-looking
man, with a red nose and a curling white moustache, came striding through brush and leaves.
He stopped when he saw the Indian, stared contemptuously at the quarry of the morning chase,
made a scornful remark about "rat-eater," and went on toward the wigwam, probably to peer in,
but the Indian's slow, clear, "keep away!" changed his plan. He grumbled something about "copper-coloured
tramp," and started away in the direction of the nearest farmhouse.

Chapter 2. Rolf Kittering and the Soldier Uncle

     A feller that chatters all the time is bound to talk a
     certain amount of drivel.--The Sayings of Si Sylvanne

This was the Crow Moon, the white man's March. The Grass Moon was at hand, and already the
arrow bands of black-necked honkers were passing northward from the coast, sending down as
they flew the glad tidings that the Hunger Moon was gone, that spring was come, yea, even now
was in the land. And the flicker clucked from a high, dry bough, the spotted woodwale drummed
on his chosen branch, the partridge drummed in the pine woods, and in the sky the wild ducks,
winging, drummed their way. What wonder that the soul of the Indian should seek expression
in the drum and the drum song of his race?

Presently, as though remembering something, he went quietly to the southward under the ridge,
just where it breaks to let the brook go by, along the edge of Strickland's Plain, and on that
hill of sliding stone he found, as he always had, the blue-eyed liver-leaf smiling, the first
sweet flower of spring! He did not gather it, he only sat down and looked at it. He did not
smile, or sing, or utter words, or give it a name, but he sat beside it and looked hard at
it, and, in the first place, he went there knowingly to find it. Who shall say that its beauty
did not reach his soul?

He took out his pipe and tobacco bag, but was reminded of something lacking--the bag was empty.
He returned to his wigwam, and from their safe hanger or swinging shelf overhead, he took the
row of stretched skins, ten muskrats and one mink, and set out along a path which led southward
through the woods to the broad, open place called Strickland's Plain, across that, and over
the next rock ridge to the little town and port of Myanos.

               SILAS PECK
               Trading Store

was the sign over the door he entered. Men and women were buying and selling, but the Indian
stood aside shyly until all were served, and Master Peck cried out:

"Ho, Quonab! what have ye got for trade to-day?"

Quonab produced his furs. The dealer looked at them narrowly and said:

"They are too late in the season for primes; I cannot allow you more than seven cents each
for the rats and seventy-five cents for the mink, all trade."

The Indian gathered up the bundle with an air of "that settles it," when Silas called out:

"Come now, I'll make it ten cents for the rats."

"Ten cents for rats, one dollar for mink, all cash, then I buy what I like," was the reply.

It was very necessary to Silas's peace that no customer of his should cross the street to the sign,

              SILAS MEAD
              Trading Store

So the bargain, a fair one now, was made, and the Indian went off with a stock of tobacco,
tea, and sugar.

His way lay up the Myanos River, as he had one or two traps set along the banks for muskrats,
although in constant danger of having them robbed or stolen by boys, who considered this an
encroachment on their trapping grounds.

After an hour he came to Dumpling Pond, then set out for his home, straight through the woods,
till he reached the Catrock line, and following that came to the farm and ramshackle house
of Micky Kittering. He had been told that the man at this farm had a fresh deer hide for sale,
and hoping to secure it, Quonab walked up toward the house. Micky was coming from the barn
when he saw the Indian. They recognized each other at a glance. That was enough for Quonab;
he turned away. The farmer remembered that he had been "insulted." He vomited a few oaths,
and strode after the Indian, "To take it out of his hide"; his purpose was very clear. The
Indian turned quickly, stood, and looked calmly at Michael.

Some men do not know the difference between shyness and cowardice, but they are apt to find
it out unexpectedly Something told the white man, "Beware! this red man is dangerous." He muttered
something about, "Get out of that, or I'll send for a constable." The Indian stood gazing coldly,
till the farmer backed off out of sight, then he himself turned away to the woods.

Kittering was not a lovely character. He claimed to have been a soldier. He certainly looked
the part, for his fierce white moustache was curled up like horns on his purple face, at each
side of his red nose, in a most milita style. His shoulders were square and his gait was swaggering,
beside which, he had an array of swear words that was new and tremendously impressive in Connecticut.
He had married late in life a woman who would have made him a good wife, had he allowed her.
But, a drunkard himself he set deliberately about bringing his wife to his own ways and with
most lamentable success. They had had no children, but some months before a brother's child,
fifteen-year-old lad, had become a charge on their hands and, with any measure of good management,
would have been a blessing to all. But Micky had gone too far. His original weak good-nature
was foundered in rum. Always blustery and frothy, he divided the world in two--superior officers,
before whom he grovelled, and inferiors to whom he was a mouthy, foul-tongued, contemptible
bully, in spite of a certain lingering kindness of heart that showed itself at such rare times
when he was neither roaring drunk nor crucified by black reaction. His brother's child, fortunately,
had inherited little of the paternal family traits, but in both body and brain favoured his
mother, the daughter of a learned divine who had spent unusual pains on her book education,
but had left her penniless and incapable of changing that condition.

Her purely mental powers and peculiarities were such that, a hundred years before, she might
have been burned for a witch, and fifty years later might have been honoured as a prophetess.
But she missed the crest of the wave both ways and fell in the trough; her views on religious
matters procured neither a witch's grave nor a prophet's crown, but a sort of village contempt.

The Bible was her standard--so far so good--but she emphasized the wrong parts of it. Instead
of magnifying the damnation of those who follow not the truth (as the village understood it),
she was content to semi-quote:

"Those that are not against me are with me," and "A kind heart is the mark of His chosen."
And then she made a final utterance, an echo really of her father: "If any man do anything
sincerely, believing that thereby he is worshipping God, he is worshipping God."

Then her fate was sealed, and all who marked the blazing eyes, the hollow cheeks, the yet more
hollow chest and cough, saw in it all the hand of an offended God destroying a blasphemer,
and shook their heads knowingly when the end came.

So Rolf was left alone in life, with a common school education, a thorough knowledge of the
Bible and of "Robinson Crusoe," a vague tradition of God everywhere, and a deep distrust of
those who should have been his own people.

The day of the little funeral he left the village of Redding to tramp over the unknown road
to the unknown south where his almost unknown Uncle Michael had a farm and, possibly, a home
for him.

Fifteen miles that day, a night's rest in a barn, twenty-five miles the next day, and Rolf
had found his future home.

"Come in, lad," was the not unfriendly reception, for his arrival was happily fallen on a brief
spell of good humour, and a strong, fifteen-year-old boy is a distinct asset on a farm.

Chapter 3. Rolf Catches a Coon and Finds a Friend

Aunt Prue, sharp-eyed and red-nosed, was actually shy at first, but all formality vanished
as Rolf was taught the mysteries of pig-feeding, hen-feeding, calf-feeding, cow-milking, and
launched by list only in a vast number of duties familiar to him from his babyhood. What a
list there was. An outsider might have wondered if Aunt Prue was saving anything for herself,
but Rolf was used to toil. He worked without ceasing and did his best, only to learn in time
that the best could win no praise, only avert punishment. The spells of good nature arrived
more seldom in his uncle's heart. His aunt was a drunken shrew and soon Rolf looked on the
days of starving and physical misery with his mother as the days of his happy youth gone by.

He was usually too tired at night and too sleepy in the morning to say his prayers, and gradually
he gave it up as a daily habit. The more he saw of his kinsfolk, the more wickedness came to
view; and yet it was with a shock that he one day realized that some fowls his uncle brought
home by night were there without the owner's knowledge or consent. Micky made a jest of it,
and intimated that Rolf would have to "learn to do night work very soon." This was only one
of the many things that showed how evil a place was now the orphan's home.

At first it was not clear to the valiant uncle whether the silent boy was a superior to be
feared, or an inferior to be held in fear, but Mick's courage grew with non-resistance, and
blows became frequent; although not harder to bear than the perpetual fault-finding and scolding
of his aunt, and all the good his mother had implanted was being shrivelled by the fires of
his daily life.

Rolf had no chance to seek for companions at the village store, but an accident brought one
to him. Before sunrise one spring morning he went, as usual, to the wood lot pasture for the
cow, and was surprised to find a stranger, who beckoned him to come. On going near he saw a
tall man with dark skin and straight black hair that was streaked with gray--undoubtedly an
Indian. He held up a bag and said, "I got coon in that hole. You hold bag there, I poke him
in." Rolf took the sack readily and held it over the hole, while the Indian climbed the tree
to a higher opening, then poked in this with a long pole, till all at once there was a scrambling
noise and the bag bulged full and heavy. Rolf closed its mouth triumphantly. The Indian laughed
lightly, then swung to the ground.

"Now, what will you do with him?" asked Rolf.

"Train coon dog," was the answer.

"Where?"

The Indian pointed toward the Asamuk Pond.

"Are you the singing Indian that lives under Ab's Rock?

"Ugh! [*] Some call me that. My name is Quonab."

"Wait for an hour and then I will come and help," volunteered Rolf impulsively, for the hunting
instinct was strong in him.

The Indian nodded. "Give three yelps if you no find me;" then he shouldered a short stick,
from one end of which, at a safe distance from his back, hung the bag with the coon. And Rolf
went home with the cow.

He had acted on hasty impulse in offering to come, but now, in the normal storm state of the
household, the difficulties of the course appeared. He cudgelled his brain for some plan to
account for his absence, and finally took refuge unwittingly in ancient wisdom: "When you don't
know a thing to do, don't do a thing." Also, "If you can't find the delicate way, go the blunt
way."

So having fed the horses, cleaned the stable, and milked the cow, fed the pigs, the hens, the
calf, harnessed the horses, cut and brought in wood for the woodshed, turned out the sheep,
hitched the horses to the wagon, set the milk out in the creaming pans, put more corn to soak
for the swill barrel, ground the house knife, helped to clear the breakfast things, replaced
the fallen rails of a fence, brought up potatoes from the root cellar, all to the maddening
music of a scolding tongue, he set out to take the cow back to the wood lot, sullenly resolved
to return when ready.

     * Ugh (yes) and wah (no) are Indianisms that continue no
     matter how well the English has been acquired.

Chapter 4. The Coon Hunt Makes Trouble for Rolf

Not one hour, but nearly three, had passed before Rolf sighted the Pipestave Pond, as it was
called. He had never been there before, but three short whoops, as arranged, brought answer
and guidance. Quonab was standing on the high rock. When Rolf came he led down to the wigwam
on its south side. It was like stepping into a new life. Several of the old neighbours at Redding
were hunters who knew the wild Indians and had told him tales that glorified at least the wonderful
woodcraft of the red man. Once or twice Rolf had seen Indians travelling through, and he had
been repelled by their sordid squalour. But here was something of a different kind; not the
Champlain ideal, indeed, for the Indian wore clothes like any poor farmer, except on his head
and his feet; his head was bare, and his feet were covered with moccasins that sparkled with
beads on the arch. The wigwam was of canvas, but it had one or two of the sacred symbols painted
on it. The pot hung over the fire was tin-lined copper, of the kind long made in England for
Indian trade, but the smaller dishes were of birch bark and basswood. The gun and the hunting
knife were of white man's make, but the bow, arrows, snowshoes, tom-tom, and a quill-covered
gun case were of Indian art, fashioned of the things that grow in the woods about.

The Indian led into the wigwam. The dog, although not fully grown, growled savagely as it smelled
the hated white man odour. Quonab gave the puppy a slap on the head, which is Indian for, "Be
quiet; he's all right;" loosed the rope, and led the dog out. "Bring that," and the Indian
pointed to the bag which hung from a stick between two trees. The dog sniffed suspiciously
in the direction of the bag and growled, but he was not allowed to come near it. Rolf tried
to make friends with the dog, but without success and Quonab said, "Better let Skookum [*]
alone. He make friends when he ready--maybe never."

The two hunters now set out for the open plain, two or three hundred yards to the southward.
Here the raccoon was dumped out of the sack, and the dog held at a little distance, until the
coon had pulled itself together and began to run. Now the dog was released and chivvied on.
With a tremendous barking he rushed at the coon, only to get a nip that made him recoil, yelping.
The coon ran as hard as it could, the dog and hunters came after it; again it was overtaken,
and, turning with a fierce snarl, it taught the dog a second lesson. Thus, running, dodging,
and turning to fight, the coon got back to the woods, and there made a final stand under a
small, thick tree; and, when the dog was again repulsed, climbed quickly up into the branches.

The hunters did all they could to excite the dog, until he was jumping about, trying to climb
the tree, and barking uproariously. This was exactly what they wanted. Skookum's first lesson
was learned--the duty of chasing the big animal of that particular smell, then barking up the
tree it had climbed.

Quonab, armed with a forked stick and a cord noose, now went up the tree. After much trouble
he got the noose around the coon's neck, then, with some rather rough handling, the animal
was dragged down, maneuvered into the sack, and carried back to camp, where it was chained
up to serve in future lessons; the next two or three being to tree the coon, as before; in
the next, the coon was to be freed and allowed to get out of sight, so that the dog might find
it by trailing, and the last, in which the coon was to be trailed, treed, and shot out of the
tree, so that the dog should have the final joy of killing a crippled coon, and the reward
of a coon-meat feast. But the last was not to be, for the night before it should have taken
place the coon managed to slip its bonds, and nothing but the empty collar and idle chain were
found in the captive's place next morning.

These things were in the future however. Rolf was intensely excited over all he had seen that
day. His hunting instincts were aroused. There had been no very obvious or repellant cruelty;
the dog alone had suffered, but he seemed happy. The whole affair was so exactly in the line
of his tastes that the boy was in a sort of ecstatic uplift, and already anticipating a real
coon hunt, when the dog should be properly trained. The episode so contrasted with the sordid
life he had left an hour before that he was spellbound. The very animal smell of the coon seemed
to make his fibre tingle. His eyes were glowing with a wild light. He was so absorbed that
he did not notice a third party attracted by the unusual noise of the chase, but the dog did.
A sudden, loud challenge called all attention to a stranger on the ridge behind the camp. There
was no mistaking the bloated face and white moustache of Rolf's uncle.

"So, you young scut! that is how you waste your time. I'll larn ye a lesson."

The dog was tied, the Indian looked harmless, and the boy was cowed, so the uncle's courage
mounted high. He had been teaming in the nearby woods, and the blacksnake whip was in his hands.
In a minute its thong was lapped, like a tongue of flame, around Rolf's legs. The boy gave
a shriek and ran, but the man followed and furiously plied the whip. The Indian, supposing
it was Rolf's father, marvelled at his method of showing affection, but said nothing, for the
Fifth Commandment is a large one in the wigwam. Rolf dodged some of the cruel blows, but was
driven into a corner of the rock. One end of the lash crossed his face like a red-hot wire.

"Now I've got you!" growled the bully.

Rolf was desperate. He seized two heavy stones and hurled the first with deadly intent at his
uncle's head. Mick dodged in time, but the second, thrown lower, hit him on the thigh. Mick
gave a roar of pain. Rolf hastily seized more stones and shrieked out, "You come on one step
and I'll kill you!"

Then that purple visage turned a sort of ashen hue. Its owner mouthed in speechless rage. He
"knew it was the Indian had put Rolf up to it. He'd see to it later," and muttering, blasting,
frothing, the hoary-headed sinner went limping off to his loaded wagon.

     * "Skookum" or "Skookum Chuck," in Chinook means "Troubled
     waters."

Chapter 5. Good-bye to Uncle Mike

     For counsel comes with the night, and action comes with the
     day; But the gray half light, neither dark nor bright, is a
     time to hide away.

Rolf had learned one thing at least--his uncle was a coward. But he also knew that he himself
was in the wrong, for he was neglecting his work and he decided to go back at once and face
the worst. He made little reply to the storm of scolding that met him. He would have been disappointed
if it had not come. He was used to it; it made him feel at home once more. He worked hard and
silently.

Mick did not return till late. He had been drawing wood for Horton that day, which was the
reason he happened in Quonab's neighbourhood; but his road lay by the tavern, and when he arrived
home he was too helpless to do more than mutter.

The next day there was an air of suspended thunder. Rolf overheard his uncle cursing "that
ungrateful young scut--not worth his salt." But nothing further was said or done. His aunt
did not strike at him once for two days. The third night Micky disappeared. On the next he
returned with another man; they had a crate of fowls, and Rolf was told to keep away from "that
there little barn."

So he did all morning, but he peeped in from the hayloft when a chance came, and saw a beautiful
horse. Next day the "little barn" was open and empty as before.

That night this worthy couple had a jollification with some callers, who were strangers to
Rolf. As he lay awake, listening to the carouse, he overheard many disjointed allusions that
he did not understand, and some that he could guess at: "Night work pays better than day work
any time," etc. Then he heard his own name and a voice, "Let's go up and settle it with him
now." Whatever their plan, it was clear that the drunken crowd, inspired by the old ruffian,
were intent on doing him bodily harm. He heard them stumbling and reeling up the steep stairs.
He heard, "Here, gimme that whip," and knew he was in peril, maybe of his life, for they were
whiskey-mad. He rose quickly, locked the door, rolled up an old rag carpet, and put it in his
bed. Then he gathered his clothes on his arm, opened the window, and lowered himself till his
head only was above the sill, and his foot found a resting place. Thus he awaited. The raucous
breathing of the revellers was loud on the stairs; then the door was tried; there was some
muttering; then the door was burst open and in rushed two, or perhaps three, figures. Rolf
could barely see in the gloom, but he knew that his uncle was one of them. The attack they
made with whip and stick on that roll of rags in the bed would have broken his bones and left
him shapeless, had he been in its place. The men were laughing and took it all as a joke, but
Rolf had seen enough; he slipped to the ground and hurried away, realizing perfectly well now
that this was "good-bye."

Which way? How naturally his steps turned northward toward Redding, the only other place he
knew. But he had not gone a mile before he stopped. The yapping of a coon dog came to him from
the near woods that lay to the westward along Asamuk. He tramped toward it. To find the dog
is one thing, to find the owner another; but they drew near at last. Rolf gave the three yelps
and Quonab responded.

"I am done with that crowd," said the boy. "They tried to kill me tonight. Have you got room
for me in your wigwam for a couple of days?"

"Ugh, come," said the Indian.

That night, for the first time, Rolf slept in the outdoor air of a wigwam. He slept late, and
knew nothing of the world about him till Quonab called him to breakfast.

Chapter 6. Skookum Accepts Rolf at Last

Rolf expected that Micky would soon hear of his hiding place and come within a few days, backed
by a constable, to claim his runaway ward. But a week went by and Quonab, passing through Myanos,
learned, first, that Rolf had been seen tramping northward on the road to Dumpling Pond, and
was now supposed to be back in Redding; second, that Micky Kittering was lodged in jail under
charge of horse-stealing and would certainly get a long sentence; third, that his wife had
gone back to her own folks at Norwalk, and the house was held by strangers.

All other doors were closed now, and each day that drifted by made it the more clear that Rolf
and Quonab were to continue together. What boy would not exult at the thought of it? Here was
freedom from a brutal tyranny that was crushing out his young life; here was a dream of the
wild world coming true, with gratification of all the hunter instincts that he had held in
his heart for years, and nurtured in that single, ragged volume of "Robinson Crusoe." The plunge
was not a plunge, except it be one when an eagle, pinion-bound, is freed and springs from a
cliff of the mountain to ride the mountain wind.

The memory of that fateful cooning day was deep and lasting. Never afterward did smell of coon
fail to bring it back; in spite of the many evil incidents it was a smell of joy.

"Where are you going, Quonab?" he asked one morning, as he saw the Indian rise at dawn and
go forth with his song drum, after warming it at the fire. He pointed up to the rock, and for
the first time Rolf heard the chant for the sunrise. Later he heard the Indian's song for "Good
Hunting," and another for "When His Heart Was Bad." They were prayers or praise, all addressed
to the Great Spirit, or the Great Father, and it gave Rolf an entirely new idea of the red
man, and a startling light on himself. Here was the Indian, whom no one considered anything
but a hopeless pagan, praying to God for guidance at each step in life, while he himself, supposed
to be a Christian, had not prayed regularly for months--was in danger of forgetting how.

Yet there was one religious observance that Rolf never forgot--that was to keep the Sabbath,
and on that day each week he did occasionally say a little prayer his mother had taught him.
He avoided being seen at such times and did not speak of kindred doings. Whereas Quonab neither
hid nor advertised his religious practices, and it was only after many Sundays had gone that
Quonab remarked:

"Does your God come only one day of the week? Does He sneak in after dark? Why is He ashamed
that you only whisper to Him? Mine is here all the time. I can always reach Him with my song;
all days are my Sunday."

The evil memories of his late life were dimming quickly, and the joys of the new one growing.
Rolf learned early that, although one may talk of the hardy savage, no Indian seeks for hardship.
Everything is done that he knows to make life pleasant, and of nothing is he more careful than
the comfort of his couch. On the second day, under guidance of his host, Rolf set about making
his own bed. Two logs, each four inches thick and three feet long, were cut. Then two strong
poles, each six feet long, were laid into notches at the ends of the short logs. About seventy-five
straight sticks of willow were cut and woven with willow bark into a lattice, three feet wide
and six feet long. This, laid on the poles, furnished a spring mattress, on which a couple
of blankets made a most comfortable couch, dry, warm, and off the ground. In addition to the
lodge cover, each bed had a dew cloth which gave perfect protection, no matter how the storm
might rage outdoors. There was no hardship in it, only a new-found pleasure, to sleep and breathe
the pure night air of the woods.

The Grass Moon--April--had passed, and the Song Moon was waxing, with its hosts of small birds,
and one of Rolf's early discoveries was that many of these love to sing by night. Again and
again the familiar voice of the song sparrow came from the dark shore of Asamuk, or the field
sparrow trilled from the top of some cedar, occasionally the painted one, Aunakeu, the partridge,
drummed in the upper woods, and nightly there was the persistent chant of Muckawis, the whippoorwill,
the myriad voices of the little frogs called spring-peepers, and the peculiar, "peent, peent,"
from the sky, followed by a twittering, that Quonab told him was the love song of the swamp
bird--the big snipe, with the fantail and long, soft bill, and eyes like a deer.

"Do you mean the woodcock?" "Ugh, that's the name; Pah-dash-ka-anja we call it."

The waning of the moon brought new songsters, with many a nightingale among them. A low bush
near the plain was vocal during the full moon with the sweet but disconnected music of the
yellow-breasted chat. The forest rang again and again with a wild, torrential strain of music
that seemed to come from the stars. It sent peculiar thrill into Rolf's heart, and gave him
a lump his throat as he listened.

"What is that, Quonab?"

The Indian shook his head. Then, later, when it ended, he said: "That is the mystery song of
some one I never saw him."

There was a long silence, then the lad began, "There's no good hunting here now, Quonab. Why
don't you go to the north woods, where deer are plentiful?"

The Indian gave a short shake of his head, and then to prevent further talk, "Put up your dew
cloth; the sea wind blows to-night."

He finished; both stood for a moment gazing into the fire. Then Rolf felt something wet and
cold thrust into his hand. It was Skookum's nose. At last the little dog had made up his mind
to accept the white boy as a friend.

Chapter 7. Rolf Works Out with Many Results

     He is the dumbest kind of a dumb fool that ain't king in
     some little corner.--Sayings of Si Sylvanne

The man who has wronged you will never forgive you, and he who has helped you will be forever
grateful. Yes, there is nothing that draws you to a man so much as the knowledge that you have
helped him.

Quonab helped Rolf, and so was more drawn to him than to many of the neighbours that he had
known for years; he was ready to like him. Their coming together was accidental, but it was
soon very clear that a friendship was springing up between them. Rolf was too much of a child
to think about the remote future; and so was Quonab. Most Indians are merely tall children.

But there was one thing that Rolf did think of--he had no right to live in Quonab's lodge without
contributing a fair share of the things needful. Quonab got his living partly by hunting, partly
by fishing, partly by selling baskets, and partly by doing odd jobs for the neighbours. Now to this objection
it maybe answered, and very satisfactorily," Is it then nothing receive what they tell us in other
matters, though we cannot prove the truth of their information; for instance,
in matters of art and science; why then is it irrational to believe
them in religion also?

Have not the wisest and holiest of men been Christians? and have not unbelievers,
on the contrary, been very generally signal instances of pride toward
convincing us of the truth of the Gospel, that those whom we love best
and reverence most believe it?

Is it against reason to think that they are right, who have considered the matter most deeply? Do
we not, discontent, and profligacy? Again, are not the principles of unbelief certain to
dissolve human society? and is not this plain fact, candidly considered, enough to show that unbelief cannot be
a right condition of our nature? for who can believe that we were intended to live in anarchy? If
we have no good reason for believing, at least we have no good reason
for disbelieving.

If you ask why we are Christians, we ask in turn, Why should we not be Christians? it will be enough
to remain where we are, till you do what you never can do-- prove to us
for certain, that the Gospel is not Divine; it is enough for us to be
on the side of good men, to be under the feet of the Saints, to' fulfilled
go our way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and to feed our kids
beside the shepherds' tent[ 1].'"

This would be quite a sufficient answer, had we nothing else to say;
but I will give another, and that in connexion with the text; I will
show you that the most unlearned Christian may have a very real and
substantial argument, an intimate token, of the truth of the Gospel,
quite independent of the authority of his parents and teachers; nay,
that were all the world, even were his teachers,, to tell him that
religion was a dream, still he would have a good reason for believing
it true.

This reason, I say, is contained in the text--" I have more understanding
than the aged, because I keep Thy commandments."

By obeying the commands of Scripture, we learn that these commands really come from God; by trying
we make proof; by doing we come to know. Now how comes this to pass?
It happens in several ways.

1.
Consider the Bible tells us to be meek, humble, single- hearted, and teachable. Now, it is plain that
humility and teachableness are qualities of mind necessary for arriving
at the truth in any subject, and in religious matters as well as
others.

By obeying Scripture, then, in practising humility and teachableness, it is evident injurious
to their comfort and good! how often do men embark in foolish and ruinous
schemes! how often do they squander their money, and destroy their worldly
prospects!

And what, I ask, is so frequent a cause of these many errors as wilfulness and presumption? The same
thing happens also in religious inquiries. When I see a person hasty and violent, harsh and high-
minded, careless of what others feel, and disdainful of what they think,-- when I see such a one
proceeding to inquire into religious subjects, I am sure beforehand he cannot go right-- he will not
be led into all the truth-- it is contrary to the nature of things
and the experience of the world, that he should find what he is seeking. I
should say the same were he seeking to find out what to believe or do in
any other matter not religious,--. Conscience, however, being respected,
will become a more powerful and enlightened guide than before; it will become
more refined and hard to please; and he will understand and perceive
more clearly the distance that exists between his own conduct and
thoughts, and perfection. He will admire and take pleasure in the holy
law of God, of which he reads in Scripture; but he will be humbled
withal but especially in any such important and solemn inquiry; for
the fear of the Lord( humbleness, teachableness, reverence towards
Him) is the very beginning of wisdom, as Solomon tells us; it leads
us to think over things modestly and honestly, to examine patiently,
to bear doubt and uncertainty, to wait perseveringly for an increase
of light, to be slow to speak, and to be deliberate in deciding.

2. Consider, in the next place, that those who are trained carefully
according to the precepts of Scripture, gain an elevation, a delicacy,
refinement, and sanctity of mind, which is most necessary for judging
fairly of the truth of Scripture. A man who loves sin does not wish the
Gospel to be true, and therefore is not a fair judge of it; a mere
man of the world, a selfish and covetous man, or a drunkard, or an
extortioner, is, from a sense of interest, against that Bible which
condemns him, and would account that man indeed a messenger of good
tidings of peace who could prove to him that Christ' s doctrine was
not from God.

I do not mean to say that such men necessarily reject the word of God,
as if we could dare to conclude that all who do not reject it are therefore
sure to be not covetous, drunkards, extortioners, and the like; for it
is often a man' s interest not openly to reject it, though it be
against him; and the bulk of men are inconsistent, and have some good
feelings left, even amid their sins and vices, which keep them from
going all lengths.

But, while they still profess to honour, at least they try to pervert
and misinterpret Scripture, and that comes to the same thing. They try to
persuade themselves that Christ will save them, though they continue
in sin; or they wish to believe that future punishment will not last
for ever; or they conceive that their good deeds or habits, few and
miserable as they are at best, will make up for the sins of which
they are too conscious.

Whereas such men as have been taught betimes to work with God their Saviour-- in ruling their
hearts, and curbing their sinful passions, and changing their wills-- though they are still sinners, have
not within them that treacherous enemy of the truth which misleads the judgments of irreligious men.
Here, then, are two very good reasons at first sight, why men who obey
the Scripture precepts are more likely to arrive at religious truth, than
those who neglect them; first, because such men are teachable men; secondly,
because they are pure in heart; such shall see God, whereas the proud
provoke His anger, and the carnal are His abhorrence. But to proceed. Consider,
moreover, that those who try to obey God evidently gain a knowledge
of themselves at least; and this may be shown to be the first and principal
step towards knowing God. For let us suppose a child, under God'
s blessing, profiting by his teacher' s guidance, and As he grows
older, he will understand this more and more.

Wishing, then, and striving to act up to the law of conscience, he will yet find that, with
his utmost efforts, and after his most earnest prayers, he still falls short
of what he knows to be right, and what he aims at, as understanding himself
to be a continual transgressor against it.

Thus he will learn from experience the doctrine of original sin,
before he knows the actual name of it. I know that in my flesh dwelleth
no good thing[ 3]." The effect of this experience will be to make him take
it for granted, as an elementary truth, that he cannot gain heaven
for himself; to make him feel himself guilty before God; and to feel,
moreover, that even were he admitted into the presence, yet, till
his heart be( so to say) made over again, he cannot perfectly enjoy
God.

This, surely, is the state of self- knowledge; these are the convictions
to which every one is brought on, who attempts honestly to obey the
precepts of God.

I do not mean that all that I have been saying will necessarily pass through his mind, and in the same
order, or that he will be conscious of it, or be able to speak of it, but that on the whole
thus he will feel. When, then, even an unlearned person thus trained-- from his own heart, from
the action of his mind upon itself, from struggles with self, from an
attempt to follow those impulses of his own nature which he feels
to be highest and noblest, from a vivid natural perception( natural,
though cherished and strengthened by prayer, natural, though unfolded
and diversified by practice, natural, though of that new and second
nature which God the Holy Ghost gives), from an innate, though supernatural
perception of the great vision of Truth which is external to him(
man in the dark might follow after some dim and distant light)-- I
say, when a person thus trained from his own heart, reads the declarations
and promises of the Gospel, are we to be told that he believes in
them merely because he has been bid believe in them?

Do we not see he has besides this a something in his own breast which bears a confirming
testimony to their truth? He reads that the heart is" deceitful above
all things and desperately wicked[ 4]," and that he inherits an evil nature
from Adam, and that he is still under its power, except so far as
he has been renewed.

Here is a mystery; but his own actual and too bitter experience bears witness to the truth of
the declaration; he feels the mystery of iniquity within him. He reads, that" without holiness no man shall
see the Lord[ 5];" and his own love of what is true and lovely and pure, approves and embraces the doctrine
as coming from God. He reads, that God is angry at sin, and will punish
the sinner, and that it is a hard matter, nay, an impossibility, for us to appease
His wrath. Here, again, is a mystery: but that the Son of God has
Himself come into the world in our flesh, and died upon the Cross
for us, does he not, amid the awful mysteriousness of the doctrine,
find those words fulfilled in him which that gracious Saviour uttered,"
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me"?

He cannot choose but believe in Him. He says," O Lord, Thou art stronger
than I, and hast prevailed." Here then, I say, he surely possesses
an evidence perfectly distinct from the authority of superiors and
teachers; like St. Paul, he is in one way not taught of men," but
by the revelation of Jesus Christ[ 6]."

Others have but bid him look within, and pray for God' s grace to be enabled
to know himself; and the more he and please God. He will perceive that there
is much in him which ought not to be in him. His own natural sense
of right and wrong tells him that peevishness, sullenness, deceit,
and self- will, are tempers and principles of which he has cause to be
ashamed, and he feels that these bad tempers and principles are in
his heart. speak here, too, his conscience anticipates his own heart,
the more are the His word is from God.

He is ready, with the Samaritan woman, to say to all around him," Come,
see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the
Christ[ 7]?" Or, again, in the words which the Samaritans of the same city used
to the woman after conversing with Christ;" Now we believe, not
because of thy saying"( not merely on the authority of friends and relatives),"
for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the
Christ, the Saviour of the world."

The Bible, then, seems to say,-- God is not a hard master to require belief,
without affording grounds for believing; only follow your own sense
of right, and you will gain from that very obedience to your Maker,
which natural conscience enjoins, a conviction of the truth and power of that
Redeemer whom a supernatural message has revealed; do but examine your
thoughts and doings; do but attempt what you know to be God' s will,
and you will most assuredly be led on into all the truth: you will recognize
the force, meaning, and awful graciousness of the Gospel Creed; you
will bear witness to the truth of one doctrine, by your own past
experience of yourselves; of another, by seeing that it is suited
to your necessity; of a third, by finding it fulfilled upon your obeying
it. My brethren, it is always reasonable to insist upon these subjects;
but it is peculiarly so in times when a spirit of presumptuous doubting
is in many places abroad. As many of us as live in the world must expect
to hear our faith despised, and our conscientious obedience ridiculed;
we must expect to be taunted and scorned by those who find it much
easier to attack another' s creed than to state their own.

A little
learning is a dangerous thing. When men think they know more than
others, they often talk for the sake of talking, or to show their
ability( as they think), their shrewdness and depth; and they speak
lightly of the All- Holy God, to gratify their empty self- conceit
and vanity.

And often it answers no purpose to dispute with such persons; for not having been trained up to obey their
conscience, to restrain their passions, and examine their hearts, they will assent to nothing you can
say; they will be questioning and arguing about every thing; they have no common
ground with you, and when they talk of religion they are like blind
persons talking the of colours.

If you urge how great a gift it is to be at peace with God, or of the arduousness
and yet desirableness of perfection, or the beauty of saintliness, or the
dangerousness of the world, or the blessedness of self- control, or the
glory of virginity, or the answers which God gives to prayer, or the
marvellousness and almost miraculousness of His providences, or the
comfort of religion in affliction, or the strength given you over
your passions in the Most Holy Sacrament, such persons understand
you not at all.

They will laugh, they will scoff, at best they will wonder: any how
what you say is no evidence to them. You cannot convince them, because
you differ from them in first principles; it is not that they start
from the same point as you, and afterwards strike off in some wayward
direction; but their course is altogether distinct, they have no
point in common with you. For such persons then you can only pray;
God alone can bring down pride, self- conceit, an arrogant spirit,
a presumptuous temper; God alone can dissipate prejudice; God alone
can overcome flesh and blood.

Useful as argument may be for converting a man, in such cases God
seldom condescends to employ it.

Yet, let not such vain or ignorant reasoners convert you to unbelief in great matters or little; let
them not persuade you, that your faith is built on the mere teaching
of fallible men; do not you be ridiculed out of your confidence and
hope in Christ.

You may, if you will, have an inward witness arising from obedience:
and though you cannot make them see it, you can see it yourselves, which
is the great thing; and it will be quite sufficient, with God' s
blessing, to keep you stedfast in the way of life.

Lastly,
let me remark how dangerous their state is who are content to take
the truths of the Gospel on trust, without caring whether or not
those truths are realized in their own heart and conduct.

Such men, when assailed by ridicule and sophistry, are likely to fall; they have no root in themselves; and
let them be quite sure, that should they fall away from the faith, it will be a slight thing at
the last day to plead that subtle arguments were used against them, that they were altogether unprepared
and ignorant, and that their seducers prevailed over them by the
display of some little cleverness and human knowledge. The inward witness
a perception of it, not indeed in its fulness, but in glimpses, and
by fits and seasons, and in its persuasive influences, and through
a courageous following on after it, as a to the truth lodged in our
hearts is a match for the most learned infidel or sceptic that ever
lived: though, to tell the truth, such men are generally very shallow
and weak, as well as wicked; generally know only a little, pervert
what they know, assume false principles, and distort or suppress facts:
but were they as accomplished as the very author of evil, the humblest
Christian, armed with sling and stone, and supported by God' s unseen
might, is, as far as his own faith is concerned, a match for them.

And, on the other hand, the most acute of reasoners and most profound of thinkers,
the most instructed in earthly knowledge, is nothing, except he has
also within him the presence of the Spirit of truth. Human knowledge,
though of great power when joined to a pure and humble faith, is of no
power when opposed to it, and, after ail, for the comfort of the individual
Christian, it is of little value. May we, then, all grow in heavenly knowledge,
and, with that end, labour to improve what is already given us, be
it more or be it less, knowing that" he that is faithful in little
is faithful also in much," and that" to him that hath, more shall
be given."[ 1] Cant. i. 8.[ 2] John iii. 20.[ 3] Rom. vii. 15, 18,
22, 23.[ 4] Jer. xvii. 9.[ 5] Heb. xii. 14.[ 6] Gal. i. 12.[ 7] John
iv. 29.[ 8] Mal. iii.

10. The Prophets were ever ungratefully treated by the Israelites,
they were resisted, their warnings neglected, their good services forgotten.
But there was this difference between the earlier and the later Prophets;
the earlier lived and died in honour among their people,-- in outward
honour; though hated and thwarted by the wicked, they were exalted
to high places, and ruled in the congregation.

Moses, for instance, was in trouble from his people all his life long, but to
the end he was their lawgiver and judge. But in the latter times, the
prophets were not only feared and hated by the enemies of God, but cast
out of the vineyard. As the time approached for the coming of the true
Prophet of the Church, the Son of God, they resembled Him in their earthly
fortunes more and more; and as He was to suffer, so did they. Moses
was a ruler, Jeremiah was an outcast: Samuel was buried in peace,
John the Baptist was beheaded.

Of these, Elijah, who lived in the wilderness, and the hundred prophets whom Obadiah fed by fifty in
a cave, are examples of the wanderers. And Micaiah, who was appointed the bread of affliction and the
water of affliction by an idolatrous king, is the specimen of those
who" had trial of bonds and imprisonment." Of those who were sawn asunder
and slain with the sword, Isaiah is the chief, who, as tradition
goes, was by order of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, sawn asunder
with a wooden saw.

And of those who were stoned, none is more famous than Zechariah, the
son of Jehoiada," who was slain between the temple and the altar[
3]." But of all the persecuted prophets Jeremiah is the most eminent;
i. e. we know more of his history, of his imprisonments, his wanderings,
and his afflictions. He may be taken as a representative of the Prophets;
and hence it is that he is an especial type of our Lord and Saviour.
All the Prophets were types of the Great Prophet whose way they were
preparing; they tended towards and spoke of Christ.

In their sufferings they foreshadowed His priesthood, and in their teaching His, prophetical office,
and in their miracles His royal power. The history of Jeremiah, then, as being drawn out in Scripture
more circumstantially than that of the other Prophets, is the most
exact type of Christ among them; that is, next to David, who, of course,
was the nearest resemblance to Him of all, as a sufferer, an inspired
teacher, and a king.

Jeremiah comes next to David; I do not say in dignity and privilege,
for it was Elijah who was taken up to heaven, and appeared at the Transfiguration;
nor in inspiration, for to Isaiah one should assign the higher evangelical
gifts; but in typifying Him who came and wept over Jerusalem, and
then was tortured and put to death by those He wept over.

And hence, when our Lord came, while some thought Him Elijah, and others John the Baptist, risen
from the dead, there were others who thought Him Jeremiah.

Of Jeremiah, then, I will now speak, as Gospel doctrines we are at least
in the way to arrive at the knowledge of God. On the other hand, impatient, proud,
self- confident, obstinate men, are generally wrong in the opinions they
form of persons and things.

Prejudice
and self- conceit blind the eyes and mislead the judgment, whatever
be the subject inquired into. For instance, how often do men mistake
the characters and misconstrue the actions of others! how often are they
deceived in them! how often do the young form acquaintances recommended
to his reason.

He is assured that Christ does not speak of Himself, but that a specimen of all those Prophets whom
St. Paul sets before us as examples of faith, and St. James as examples of patience. Jeremiah' s ministry
may be summed up in three words, good hope, labour, disappointment. It
was his privilege to be called to his sacred office from his earliest
years. Like Samuel, the first prophet, he was of the tribe of Levi,
dedicated from his birth to religious services, and favoured with the
constant presence and grace of God." Before I formed thee... This commission
was given the year after Josiah began his reformation.

Jeremiah returned for answer," Ah! Lord God! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child." He felt the arduousness
of a prophet' s office; the firmness and intrepidity which were required
to trying to do his duty the mystery, and convicts him; his mouth is stopped.
And when he goes on to read the words of God.


Quonab went back into the woods, then behind the stone walls to get around to the side next
the ridge, and crawling so flat on his breast in the clover that, although it was but a foot
high, he was quite invisible to any one not placed much above him.

In this way he came to the little ridge back of the woodchuck den, quite unknown to its occupants.
But now he was in a difficulty. He could not see any of them.

They were certainly beyond range of his bow, and it was difficult to make them seek the den
without their rushing into it. But he was equal to the occasion. He raised one hand and made
the query sign, and watching Rolf he got answer, "All well; they are there." (A level sweep
of the flat hand and a finger pointing steadily.) Then he waited a few seconds and made exactly
the same sign, getting the same answer.

He knew that the movement of the distant man would catch the eye of the old woodchuck; she
would sit up high to see what it was, and when it came a second time she would, without being
exactly alarmed, move toward the den and call the young ones to follow.

The hunter had not long to wait. He heard her shrill, warning whistle, then the big chuck trotted
and waddled into sight, stopping occasionally to nibble or look around. Close behind her were
the two fat cubs. Arrived near the den their confidence was restored, and again they began
to feed, the young ones close to the den. Then Quonab put a blunt bird dart in his bow and
laid two others ready. Rising as little as possible, he drew the bow. 'Tsip! the blunt arrow
hit the young chuck on the nose and turned him over. The other jumped in surprise and stood
up. So did the mother. 'Tsip! another bolt and the second chuck was kicking. But the old one
dashed like a flash into the underground safety of her den. Quonab knew that she had seen nothing
of him and would likely come forth very soon. He waited for some time; then the gray-brown
muzzle of the fat old clover-stealer came partly to view; but it was not enough for a shot,
and she seemed to have no idea of coming farther. The Indian waited what seemed like a long
time, then played an ancient trick. He began to whistle a soft, low air. Whether the chuck
thinks it is another woodchuck calling, or merely a pleasant sound, is not known, but she soon
did as her kind always does, came out of the hole slowly and ever higher, till she was half
out and sitting up, peering about.

This was Quonab's chance. He now drew a barbed hunting arrow to the head and aimed it behind
her shoulders. 'Tsip! and the chuck was transfixed by a shaft that ended her life a minute
later, and immediately prevented that instinctive scramble into the hole, by which so many
chucks elude the hunter, even when mortally wounded.

Now Quonab stood up without further concealment, and beckoned to Rolf, who came running. Three
fat woodchucks meant abundance of the finest fresh meat for a week; and those who have not
tried it have no idea what a delicacy is a young, fat, clover-fed woodchuck, pan-roasted, with
potatoes, and served at a blazing campfire to a hunter who is young, strong, and exceedingly
hungry.

Chapter 13. The Fight with the Demon of the Deep

One morning, as they passed the trail that skirts the pond, Quonab pointed to the near water.
There was something afloat like a small, round leaf, with two beads well apart, on it. Then
Rolf noticed, two feet away, a larger floating leaf, and now he knew that the first was the
head and eyes, the last the back, of a huge snapping turtle. A moment more and it quickly sank
from view. Turtles of three different kinds were common, and snappers were well known to Rolf;
but never before had he seen such a huge and sinister-looking monster of the deep.

"That is Bosikado. I know him; he knows me," said the red man. "There has long been war between
us; some day we will settle it. I saw him here first three years ago. I had shot a duck; it
floated on the water. Before I could get to it something pulled it under, and that was the
last of it. Then a summer duck came with young ones. One by one he took them, and at last got
her. He drives all ducks away, so I set many night lines for him. I got some little snappers,
eight and ten pounds each. They were good to eat, and three times already I took Bosikado on
the hooks, but each time when I pulled him up to the canoe, he broke my biggest line and went
down. He was as broad as the canoe; his claws broke through the canoe skin; he made it bulge
and tremble. He looked like the devil of the lake. I was afraid!

"But my father taught me there is only one thing that can shame a man--that is to be afraid,
and I said I will never let fear be my guide. I will seek a fair fight with Bosikado. He is
my enemy. He made me afraid once; I will make him much afraid. For three years we have been
watching each other. For three years he has kept all summer ducks away, and robbed my fish-lines,
my nets, and my muskrat traps. Not often do I see him--mostly like today.

"Before Skookum I had a little dog, Nindai. He was a good little dog. He could tree a coon,
catch a rabbit, or bring out a duck, although he was very small. We were very good friends.
One time I shot a duck; it fell into the lake; I called Nindai. He jumped into the water and
swam to the duck. Then that duck that I thought dead got up and flew away, so I called Nindai.
He came across the water to me. By and by, over that deep place, he howled and splashed. Then
he yelled, like he wanted me. I ran for the canoe and paddled quick; I saw my little dog Nindai
go down. Then I knew it was that Bosikado again. I worked a long time with a pole, but found
nothing; only five days later one of Nindai's paws floated down the stream. Some day I will
tear open that Bosikado!

"Once I saw him on the bank. He rolled down like a big stone to the water. He looked at me
before he dived, and as we looked in each other's eyes I knew he was a Manito; but he is evil,
and my father said, 'When an evil Manito comes to trouble you, you must kill him.'

"One day, when I swam after a dead duck, he took me by the toe, but I reached shallow water
and escaped him; and once I drove my fish-spear in his back, but it was not strong enough to
hold him. Once he caught Skookum's tail, but the hair came out; the dog has not since swum
across the pond.

"Twice I have seen him like today and might have killed him with the gun, but I want to meet
him fighting. Many a time I have sat on the bank and sung to him the 'Coward's Song,' and dared
him to come and fight in the shallow water where we are equals. He hears me. He does not come.

"I know he made me sick last winter; even now he is making trouble with his evil magic. But
my magic must prevail, and some day we shall meet. He made me afraid once. I will make him
much afraid, and will meet him in the water."

Not many days were to pass before the meeting. Rolf had gone for water at the well, which was
a hole dug ten feet from the shore of the lake. He had learned the hunter's cautious trick
of going silently and peering about, before he left cover. On a mud bank in a shallow bay,
some fifty yards off, he described a peculiar gray and greenish form that he slowly made out
to be a huge turtle, sunning itself. The more he looked and gauged it with things about, the
bigger it seemed. So he slunk back quickly and silently to Quonab. "He is out sunning himself--Bosikado--on
the bank!"

The Indian rose quickly, took his tomahawk and a strong line. Rolf reached for the gun, but
Quonab shook his head. They went to the lake. Yes! There was the great, goggle-eyed monster,
like a mud-coloured log. The bank behind him was without cover. It would be impossible to approach
the watchful creature within striking distance before he could dive. Quonab would not use the
gun; in this case he felt he must atone by making an equal fight. He quickly formed a plan;
he fastened the tomahawk and the coiled rope to his belt, then boldly and silently slipped
into the lake, to approach the snapper from the water side--quite the easiest in this case,
not only because the snapper would naturally watch on the land side, but because there was
a thick clump of rushes behind which the swimmer could approach.

Then, as instructed, Rolf went back into the woods, and came silently to a place whence he
could watch the snapper from a distance of twenty yards.

The boy's heart beat fast as he watched the bold swimmer and the savage reptile. There could
be little doubt that the creature weighed a hundred pounds. It is the strongest for its size
and the fiercest of all reptiles. Its jaws, though toothless, have cutting edges, a sharp beak,
and power to the crushing of bones. Its armour makes it invulnerable to birds and beasts of
prey. Like a log it lay on the beach, with its long alligator tail stretched up the bank and
its serpentine head and tiny wicked eyes vigilantly watching the shore. Its shell, broad and
ancient, was fringed with green moss, and its scaly armpits exposed, were decked with leeches,
at which a couple of peetweets pecked with eager interest, apparently to the monster's satisfaction.
Its huge limbs and claws were in marked contrast to the small, red eyes. But the latter it
was that gave the thrill of unnervement.

Sunk down nearly out of sight, the Indian slowly reached the reeds. Here he found bottom, and
pausing, he took the rope in one hand, the tomahawk in the other, and dived, and when he reappeared
he was within ten yards of the enemy, and in water but four feet deep.

With a sudden rush the reptile splashed into the pond and out of sight, avoiding the rope noose.
But Quonab clutched deep in the water as it passed, and seized the monster's rugged tail. Then
it showed its strength. In a twinkling that mighty tail was swung sidewise, crushing the hand
with terrible force against the sharp-edged points of the back armour. It took all the Indian's
grit to hold on to that knife-edged war club. He dropped his tomahawk, then with his other
hand swung the rope to catch the turtle's head, but it lurched so quickly that the rope missed
again, slipped over the shell, and, as they struggled, encircled one huge paw. The Indian jerked
it tight, and they were bound together. But now his only weapon was down at the bottom and
the water all muddied. He could not see, but plunged to grope for the tomahawk. The snapper
gave a great lurch to escape, releasing the injured hand, but jerking the man off his legs.
Then, finding itself held by a forepaw, it turned with gaping, hissing jaws, and sprang on
the foe that struggled in bottom of the water.

The snapper has the bulldog habit to seize and hold till the piece tears out. In the muddy
water it had to seize in the dark, and fending first the left arm of its foe, fastened on with
fierce beak and desperate strength. At this moment Quonab recovered his tomahawk; rising into
the air he dragged up the hanging snapper, and swung the weapon with all the force of his free
arm. The blow sank through the monster's shell, deep into its back, without any visible effect,
except to rob the Indian of his weapon as he could not draw it out.

Then Rolf rushed into the water to help. But Quonab gasped, "No, no, go back--I'm alone."

The creature's jaws were locked on his arm, but its front claws, tearing downward and outward,
were demolishing the coat that had protected it, and long lines of mingled blood were floating
on the waves.

After a desperate plunge toward shallow water, Quonab gave another wrench to the tomahawk--it
moved, loosed; another, and it was free. Then "chop, chop, chop," and that long, serpentine
neck was severed; the body, waving its great scaly legs and lashing its alligator tail, went
swimming downward, but the huge head, blinking its bleary, red eyes and streaming with blood,
was clinched on his arm. The Indian made for the bank hauling the rope that held the living
body, and fastened it to a tree, then drew his knife to cut the jaw muscles of the head that
ground its beak into his flesh. But the muscles were protected by armour plates and bone; he
could not deal a stab to end their power. In vain he fumbled and slashed, until in a spasmodic
quiver the jaws gaped wide and the bloody head fell to the ground. Again it snapped, but a
tree branch bore the brunt; on this the strong jaws clinched, and so remained.

For over an hour the headless body crawled, or tried to crawl, always toward the lake. And
now they could look at the enemy. Not his size so much as his weight surprised them. Although
barely four feet long, he was so heavy that Rolf could not lift him. Quonab's scratches were
many but slight; only the deep bill wound made his arm and the bruises of the jaws were at
all serious and of these he made light. Headed by Skookum in full 'yap,' they carried the victim's
body to camp; the head, still dutching the stick, was decorated with three feathers, then set
on a pole near the wigwam. And the burden of the red man's song when next he sang was:

"Bosikado, mine enemy was mighty, But I went into his country And made him afraid!"

Chapter 14. Selectman Horton Appears at the Rock

Summer was at its height on the Asamuk. The woodthrush was nearing the end of its song; a vast
concourse of young robins in their speckled plumage joined chattering every night in the thickest
cedars; and one or two broods of young ducks were seen on the Pipestave Pond.

Rolf had grown wonderfully well into his wigwam life. He knew now exactly how to set the flap
so as to draw out all the smoke, no matter which way the wind blew; he had learned the sunset
signs, which tell what change of wind the night might bring. He knew without going to the shore
whether the tide was a little ebb, with poor chances, or a mighty outflow that would expose
the fattest oyster beds. His practiced fingers told at a touch whether it was a turtle or a
big fish on his night line; and by the tone of the tom-tom he knew when a rainstorm was at hand.

Being trained in industry, he had made many improvements in their camp, not the least of which
was to clean up and burn all the rubbish and garbage that attracted hordes of flies. He had
fitted into the camp partly by changing it to fit himself, and he no longer felt that his stay
there was a temporary shift. When it was to end, he neither knew nor cared. He realized only
that he was enjoying life as he never had done before. His canoe had passed a lot of rapids
and was now in a steady, unbroken stream--but it was the swift shoot before the fall. A lull
in the clamour does not mean the end of war, but a new onset preparing; and, of course, it
came in the way least looked for.

Selectman Horton stood well with the community; he was a man of good judgment, good position,
and kind heart. He was owner of all the woods along the Asamuk, and thus the Indian's landlord
on the Indian's ancestral land. Both Rolf and Quonab had worked for Horton, and so they knew
him well, and liked him for his goodness.

It was Wednesday morning, late in July, when Selectman Horton, clean-shaven and large, appeared
at the wigwam under the rock.

"Good morrow to ye both!" Then without wasting time he plunged in. "There's been some controversy
and much criticism of the selectmen for allowing a white lad, the child of Christian parents,
the grandson of a clergyman, to leave all Christian folk and folds, and herd with a pagan,
to become, as it were, a mere barbarian. I hold not, indeed, with those that out of hand would
condemn as godless a good fellow like Quonab, who, in my certain knowledge and according to
his poor light, doth indeed maintain in some kind a daily worship of a sort. Nevertheless,
the selectmen, the magistrates, the clergy, the people generally, and above all the Missionary
Society, are deeply moved in the matter. It hath even been made a personal charge against myself,
and with much bitterness I am held up as unzealous for allowing such a nefarious stronghold
of Satan to continue on mine own demesne, and harbour one, escaped, as it were, from grace.
Acting, therefore, not according to my heart, but as spokesman of the Town Council, the Synod
of Elders, and the Society for the Promulgation of Godliness among the Heathen, I am to state
that you, Rolf Kittering, being without kinsfolk and under age, are in verity a ward of the
parish, and as such, it hath been arranged that you become a member of the household of the
most worthy Elder Ezekiel Peck, a household filled with the spirit of estimable piety and true
doctrine; a man, indeed, who, notwithstanding his exterior coldness and severity, is very sound
in all matters regarding the Communion of Saints, and, I may even say in a measure a man of
fame for some most excellent remarks he hath passed on the shorter catechism, beside which
he hath gained much approval for having pointed out two hidden meanings in the 27th verse of
the 12th chapter of Hebrews; one whose very presence, therefore, is a guarantee against levity,
laxity, and false preachment.

"There, now, my good lad, look not so like a colt that feels the whip for the first time. You
will have a good home, imbued with the spirit of a most excellent piety that will be ever about
you."

"Like a colt feeling the whip," indeed! Rolf reeled like a stricken deer. To go back as a chore-boy
drudge was possible, but not alluring; to leave Quonab, just as the wood world was opening
to him, was devastating; but to exchange it all for bondage in the pious household of Old Peck,
whose cold cruelty had driven off all his own children, was an accumulation of disasters that
aroused him.

"I won't go!" he blurted out, and gazed defiantly at the broad and benevolent selectman.

"Come now, Rolf, such language is unbecoming. Let not a hasty tongue betray you into sin. This
is what your mother would have wished. Be sensible; you will soon find it was all for the best.
I have ever liked you, and will ever be a friend you can count on.

"Acting, not according to my instructions, but according to my heart, I will say further that
you need not come now, you need not even give answer now, but think it over. Nevertheless,
remember that on or before Monday morning next, you will be expected to appear at Elder Peck's,
and I fear that, in case you fail, the messenger next arriving will be one much less friendly
than myself. Come now, Rolf, be a good lad, and remember that in your new home you will at
least be living for the glory of God."

Then, with a friendly nod, but an expression of sorrow, the large, black messenger turned and
tramped away.

Rolf slowly, limply, sank down on a rock and stared at the fire. After awhile Quonab got up
and began to prepare the mid-day meal. Usually Rolf helped him. Now he did nothing but sullenly
glare at the glowing coals. In half an hour the food was ready. He ate little; then went away
in the woods by himself. Quonab saw him lying on a flat rock, looking at the pond, and throwing
pebbles into it. Later Quonab went to Myanos. On his return he found that Rolf had cut up a
great pile of wood, but not a word passed between them. The look of sullen anger and rebellion
on Rolf's face was changing to one of stony despair. What was passing in each mind the other
could not divine.

The evening meal was eaten in silence; then Quonab smoked for an hour, both staring into the
fire. A barred owl hooted and laughed over their heads, causing the dog to jump up and bark
at the sound that ordinarily he would have heeded not at all. Then silence was restored, and
the red man's hidden train of thought was in a flash revealed.

"Rolf, let's go to the North Woods!"

It was another astounding idea. Rolf had realized more and more how much this valley meant
to Quonab, who worshipped the memory of his people.

"And leave all this?" he replied, making a sweep with his hand toward the rock, the Indian
trail, the site of bygone Petuquapen, and the graves of the tribe.

For reply their eyes met, and from the Indian's deep chest came the single word, "Ugh." One
syllable, deep and descending, but what a tale it told of the slowly engendered and strong-grown
partiality, of a struggle that had continued since the morning when the selectman came with
words of doom, and of friendship's victory won.

Rolf realized this, and it gave him a momentary choking in his throat, and, "I'm ready if you
really mean it."

"Ugh I go, but some day come back."

There was a long silence, then Rolf, "When shall we start?" and the answer, "To-morrow night."

Chapter 15. Bound for the North Woods

When Quonab left camp in the morning he went heavy laden, and the trail he took led to Myanos.
There was nothing surprising in it when he appeared at Silas Peck's counter and offered for
sale a pair of snowshoes, a bundle of traps, some dishes of birch bark and basswood, and a
tom-tom, receiving in exchange some tea, tobacco, gunpowder, and two dollars in cash. He turned
without comment, and soon was back in camp. He now took the kettle into the woods and brought
it back filled with bark, fresh chipped from a butternut tree. Water was added, and the whole
boiled till it made a deep brown liquid. When this was cooled he poured it into a flat dish,
then said to Rolf: "Come now, I make you a Sinawa."

With a soft rag the colour was laid on. Face, head, neck, and hands were all at first intended,
but Rolf said, "May as well do the whole thing." So he stripped off; the yellow brown juice
on his white skin turned it a rich copper colour, and he was changed into an Indian lad that
none would have taken for Rolf Kittering. The stains soon dried, and Rolf, re-clothed, felt
that already he had burned a bridge.

Two portions of the wigwam cover were taken off; and two packs were made of the bedding. The
tomahawk, bows, arrows, and gun, with the few precious food pounds in the copper pot, were
divided between them and arranged into packs with shoulder straps; then all was ready. But
there was one thing more for Quonab; he went up alone to the rock. Rolf knew what he went for,
and judged it best not to follow.

The Indian lighted his pipe, blew the four smokes to the four winds, beginning with the west,
then he sat in silence for a time. Presently the prayer for good hunting came from the rock:

     "Father lead us!
     Father, help us!
     Father, guide us to the good hunting."

And when that ceased a barred owl hooted in the woods, away to the north.

"Ugh! good," was all he said as he rejoined Rolf; and they set out, as the sun went down, on
their long journey due northward, Quonab, Rolf, and Skookum. They had not gone a hundred yards
before the dog turned back, raced to a place where he had a bone in cache and rejoining there
trotted along with his bone.

The high road would have been the easier travelling, but it was very necessary to be unobserved,
so they took the trail up the brook Asamuk, and after an hour's tramp came out by the Cat-Rock
road that runs westerly. Again they were tempted by the easy path, but again Quonab decided
on keeping to the woods. Half an hour later they were halted by Skookum treeing a coon. After
they had secured the dog, they tramped on through the woods for two hours more, and then, some
eight miles from the Pipestave, they halted, Rolf, at least, tired out. It was now midnight.
They made a hasty double bed of the canvas cover over a pole above them, and slept till morning,
cheered, as they closed their drowsy eyes, by the "Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, yah, hoo," of their
friend, the barred owl, still to the northward.

The sun was high, and Quonab had breakfast ready before Rolf awoke. He was so stiff with the
tramp and the heavy pack that it was with secret joy he learned that they were to rest, concealed
in the woods, that day, and travel only by night, until in a different region, where none knew
or were likely to stop them. They were now in York State, but that did not by any means imply
that they were beyond pursuit.

As the sun rose high, Rolf went forth with his bow and blunt arrows, and then, thanks largely
to Skookum, he succeeded in knocking over a couple of squirrels, which, skinned and roasted,
made their dinner that day. At night they set out as before, making about ten miles. The third
night they did better, and the next day being Sunday, they kept out of sight. But Monday morning,
bright and clear, although it was the first morning when they were sure of being missed, they
started to tramp openly along the highway, with a sense of elation that they had not hitherto
known on the joumey. Two things impressed Rolf by their novelty: the curious stare of the country
folk whose houses and teams they passed, and the violent antagonism of the dogs. Usually the
latter could be quelled by shaking a stick at them, or by pretending to pick up a stone, but
one huge and savage brindled mastiff kept following and barking just out of stick range, and
managed to give Skookum a mauling, until Quonab drew his bow and let fly a blunt arrow that
took the brute on the end of the nose, and sent him howling homeward, while Skookum got a few
highly satisfactory nips at the enemy's rear. Twenty miles they made that day and twenty-five
the next, for now they were on good roads, and their packs were lighter. More than once they
found kind farmer folk who gave them a meal. But many times Skookum made trouble for them.
The farmers did not like the way he behaved among their hens. Skookum never could be made to
grasp the fine zoological distinction between partridges which are large birds and fair game,
and hens which are large birds, but not fair game. Such hair splitting was obviously unworthy
of study, much less of acceptance.

Soon it was clearly better for Rolf, approaching a house, to go alone, while Quonab held Skookum.
The dogs seemed less excited by Rolf's smell, and remembering his own attitude when tramps
came to one or another of his ancient homes, he always asked if they would let him work for
a meal, and soon remarked that his success was better when he sought first the women of the
house, and then, smiling to show his very white teeth, spoke in clear and un-Indian English,
which had the more effect coming from an evident Indian.

"Since I am to be an Indian, Quonab, you must give me an Indian name," he said after one of
these episodes.

"Ugh! Good! That's easy! You are 'Nibowaka,' the wise one." For the Indian had not missed any
of the points, and so he was named.

Twenty or thirty miles a day they went now, avoiding the settlements along the river. Thus
they saw nothing of Albany, but on the tenth day they reached Fort Edward, and for the first
time viewed the great Hudson. Here they stayed as short a time as might be, pushed on by Glen's
Falls, and on the eleventh night of the journey they passed the old, abandoned fort, and sighted
the long stretch of Lake George, with its wooded shore, and glimpses of the mountains farther
north.

Now a new thought possessed them--"If only they had the canoe that they had abandoned on the
Pipestave." It came to them both at the sight of the limit less water, and especially when
Rolf remembered that Lake George joined with Champlain, which again was the highway to all
the wilderness.

They camped now as they had fifty times before, and made their meal. The bright blue water
dancing near was alluring, inspiring; as they sought the shore Quonab pointed to a track and
said, "Deer." He did not show much excitement, but Rolf did, and they returned to the camp
fire with a new feeling of elation--they had reached the Promised Land. Now they must prepare
for the serious work of finding a hunting ground that was not already claimed.

Quonab, remembering the ancient law of the woods, that parcels off the valleys, each to the
hunter first arriving, or succeeding the one who had, was following his own line of thought.
Rolf was puzzling over means to get an outfit, canoe, traps, axes, and provisions. The boy
broke silence.

"Quonab, we must have money to get an outfit; this is the beginning of harvest; we can easily
get work for a month. That will feed us and give us money enough to live on, and a chance to
learn something about the country."

The reply was simple, "You are Nibowaka."

The farms were few and scattered here, but there were one or two along the lake. To the nearest
one with standing grain Rolf led the way. But their reception, from the first brush with the
dog to the final tilt with the farmer, was unpleasant--"He didn't want any darn red-skins around
there. He had had two St. Regis Indians last year, and they were a couple of drunken good-for-nothings."

The next was the house of a fat Dutchman, who was just wondering how he should meet the compounded
accumulated emergencies of late hay, early oats, weedy potatoes, lost cattle, and a prospective
increase of his family, when two angels of relief appeared at his door, in copper-coloured skins.

"Cahn yo work putty goood?

"Yes, I have always lived on a farm," and Rolf showed his hands, broad and heavy for his years.

"Cahn yo mebby find my lost cows, which I haf not find, already yet?"

Could they! it would be fun to try.

"I giff yo two dollars you pring dem putty kvick."

So Quonab took the trail to the woods, and Rolf started into the potatoes with a hoe, but he
was stopped by a sudden outcry of poultry. Alas! It was Skookum on an ill-judged partridge
hunt. A minute later he was ignominiously chained to a penitential post, nor left it during
the travellers' sojourn.

In the afternoon Quonab returned with the cattle, and as he told Rolf he saw five deer, there
was an unmistakable hunter gleam in his eye.

Three cows in milk, and which had not been milked for two days, was a serious matter, needing
immediate attention. Rolf had milked five cows twice a day for five years, and a glance showed
old Van Trumper that the boy was an expert.

"Good, good! I go now make feed swine."

He went into the outhouse, but a tow-topped, redcheeked girl ran after him. "Father, father,
mother says--" and the rest was lost.

"Myn Hemel! Myn Hemel! I thought it not so soon," and the fat Dutchman followed the child.
A moment later he reappeared, his jolly face clouded with a look of grave concern. "Hi yo big
Injun, yo cahn paddle canoe?" Quonab nodded. "Den coom. Annette, pring Tomas und Hendrik."
So the father carried two-year-old Hendrik, while the Indian carried six-year-old Tomas, and
twelve-year-old Annette followed in vague, uncomprehended alarm. Arrived at the shore the children
were placed in the canoe, and then the difficulties came fully to the father's mind--he could
not leave his wife. He must send the children with the messenger--In a sort of desperation,
"Cahn you dem childen take to de house across de lake, and pring back Mrs. Callan? Tell her
Marta Van Trumper need her right now mooch very kvick." The Indian nodded. Then the father
hesitated, but a glance at the Indian was enough. Something said, "He is safe," and in spite
of sundry wails from the little ones left with a dark stranger, he pushed off the canoe: "Yo
take care for my babies," and turned his brimming eyes away.

The farmhouse was only two miles off, and the evening calm; no time was lost: what woman will
not instantly drop all work and all interests, to come to the help of another in the trial
time of motherhood?

Within an hour the neighbour's wife was holding hands with the mother of the banished tow-heads.
He who tempers the wind and appoints the season of the wild deer hinds had not forgotten the
womanhood beyond the reach of skilful human help, and with the hard and lonesome life had conjoined
a sweet and blessed compensation. What would not her sister of the city give for such immunity;
and long before that dark, dread hour of night that brings the ebbing life force low, the wonderful
miracle was complete; there was another tow-top in the settler's home, and all was well.

Chapter 16. Life with the Dutch Settler

The Indians slept in the luxuriant barn of logs, with blankets, plenty of hay, and a roof.
They were more than content, for now, on the edge of the wilderness, they were very close to
wild life. Not a day or a night passed without bringing proof of that.

One end of the barn was portioned off for poultry. In this the working staff of a dozen hens
were doing their duty, which, on that first night of the "brown angels' visit," consisted of
silent slumber, when all at once the hens and the new hands were aroused by a clamorous cackling,
which speedily stopped. It sounded like a hen falling in a bad dream, then regaining her perch
to go to sleep again. But next morning the body of one of these highly esteemed branches of
the egg-plant was found in the corner, partly devoured. Quonab examined the headless hen, the
dust around, and uttered the word, "Mink."

Rolf said, "Why not skunk?"

"Skunk could not climb to the perch."

"Weasel then."

"Weasel would only suck the blood, and would kill three or four."

"Coon would carry him away, so would fox or wildcat, and a marten would not come into the building
by night."

There was no question, first, that it was a mink, and, second, that he was hiding about the
barn until the hunger pang should send him again to the hen house. Quonab covered the hen's
body with two or three large stones so that there was only one approach. In the way of this
approach he buried a "number one" trap.

That night they were aroused again; this time by a frightful screeching, and a sympathetic,
inquiring cackle from the fowls.

Arising, quickly they entered with a lantem. Rolf then saw a sight that gave him a prickling
in his hair. The mink, a large male, was caught by one front paw. He was writhing and foaming,
tearing, sometimes at the trap, sometimes at the dead hen, and sometimes at his own imprisoned
foot, pausing now and then to utter the most ear-piercing shrieks, then falling again in crazy
animal fury on the trap, splintering his sharp white teeth, grinding the cruel metal with bruised
and bloody jaws, frothing, snarling, raving mad. As his foemen entered he turned on them a
hideous visage of inexpressible fear and hate, rage and horror. His eyes glanced back green
fire in the lantern light; he strained in renewed efforts to escape; the air was rank with
his musky smell. The impotent fury of his struggle made a picture that continued in Rolf's
mind. Quonab took a stick and with a single blow put an end to the scene, but never did Rolf
forget it, and never afterward was he a willing partner when the trapping was done with those
relentless jaws of steel.

A week later another hen was missing, and the door of the hen house left open. After a careful
examination of the dust, inside and out of the building, Quonab said, "Coon." It is very unusual
for coons to raid a hen house. Usually it is some individual with abnormal tastes, and once
he begins, he is sure to come back. The Indian judged that he might be back the next night,
so prepared a trap. A rope was passed from the door latch to a tree; on this rope a weight
was hung, so that the door was selfshutting, and to make it self-locking he leaned a long pole
against it inside. Now he propped it open with a single platform, so set that the coon must
walk on it once he was inside, and so release the door. The trappers thought they would hear
in the night when the door closed, but they were sleepy; they knew nothing until next morning.
Then they found that the self-shutter had shut, and inside, crouched in one of the nesting
boxes, was a tough, old fighting coon. Strange to tell, he had not touched a second hen. As
soon as he found himself a prisoner he had experienced a change of heart, and presently his
skin was nailed on the end of the barn and his meat was hanging in the larder.

"Is this a marten," asked little Annette. And when told not, her disappointment elicited the
information that old Warren, the storekeeper, had promised her a blue cotton dress for a marten
skin.

"You shall have the first one I catch," said Rolf.

Life in Van Trumper's was not unpleasant. The mother was going about again in a week. Annette
took charge of the baby, as well as of the previous arrivals. Hendrik senior was gradually
overcoming his difficulties, thanks to the unexpected help, and a kindly spirit made the hard
work not so very hard. The shyness that was at first felt toward the Indians wore off, especially
in the case of Rolf, he was found so companionable; and the Dutchman, after puzzling over the
combination of brown skin and blue eyes, decided that Rolf was a half-breed.

August wore on not unpleasantly for the boy, but Quonab was getting decidedly restless. He
could work for a week as hard as any white man, but his race had not risen to the dignity of
patient, unremitting, life-long toil.

"How much money have we now, Nibowaka?" was one of the mid-August indications of restlessness.
Rolf reckoned up; half a month for Quonab, $15.00; for himself, $10.00; for finding the cows
$2.00--$27.00 in all. Not enough.

Three days later Quonab reckoned up again. Next day he said: "We need two months' open water
to find a good country and build a shanty." Then did Rolf do the wise thing; he went to fat
Hendrik and told him all about it. They wanted to get a canoe and an outfit, and seek for a
trapping or hunting ground that would not encroach on those already possessed, for the trapping
law is rigid; even the death penalty is not considered too high in certain cases of trespass,
provided the injured party is ready to be judge, jury, and executioner. Van Trumper was able
to help them not a little in the matter of location--there was no use trying on the Vermont
side, nor anywhere near Lake Champlain, nor near Lake George; neither was it worth while going
to the far North, as the Frenchmen came in there, and they were keen hunters, so that Hamilton
County was more promising than any other, but it was almost inaccessible, remote from all the
great waterways, and of course without roads; its inaccessibility was the reason why it was
little known. So far so good; but happy Hendrik was unpleasantly surprised to learn that the
new help were for leaving at once. Finally he made this offer: If they would stay till September
first, and so leave all in "good shape fer der vinter," he would, besides the wages agreed,
give them the canoe, one axe, six mink traps, and a fox trap now hanging in the barn, and carry
them in his wagon as far as the Five-mile portage from Lake George to Schroon River, down which
they could go to its junction with the upper Hudson, which, followed up through forty miles
of rapids and hard portages, would bring them to a swampy river that enters from the southwest,
and ten miles up this would bring them to Jesup's Lake, which is two miles wide and twelve
miles long. This country abounded with game, but was so hard to enter that after Jesup's death
it was deserted.

There was only one possible answer to such an offer--they stayed.

In spare moments Quonab brought the canoe up to the barn, stripped off some weighty patches
of bark and canvas and some massive timber thwarts, repaired the ribs, and when dry and gummed,
its weight was below one hundred pounds; a saving of at least forty pounds on the soggy thing
he crossed the lake in that first day on the farm.

September came. Early in the morning Quonab went alone to the lakeside; there on a hill top
he sat, looking toward the sunrise, and sang a song of the new dawn, beating, not with a tom-tom--he
had none--but with one stick on another. And when the sunrise possessed the earth he sang again
the hunter's song:

"Father, guide our feet, Lead us to the good hunting."

Then he danced to the sound, his face skyward, his eyes closed, his feet barely raised, but
rythmically moved. So went he three times round to the chant in three sun circles, dancing
a sacred measure, as royal David might have done that day when he danced around the Ark of
the Covenant on its homeward joumey. His face was illumined, and no man could have seen him
then without knowing that this was a true heart's worship of a true God, who is in all things
He has made.

     Sylvanne.

A settler named Hulett had a scow that was borrowed by the neighbours whenever needed to take
a team across the lake. On the morning of their journey, the Dutchman's team and wagon, the
canoe and the men, were aboard the scow, Skookum took his proper place at the prow, and all
was ready for "Goodbye." Rolf found it a hard word to say. The good old Dutch mother had won
his heart, and the children were like his brothers and sisters.

"Coom again, lad; coom and see us kvick." She kissed him, he kissed Annette and the three later
issues. They boarded the scow to ply the poles till the deep water was reached, then the oars.
An east wind springing up gave them a chance to profit by a wagon-cover rigged as a sail, and
two hours later the scow was safely landed at West Side, where was a country store, and the
head of the wagon road to the Schroon River.

As they approached the door, they saw a rough-looking man slouching against the building, his
hands in his pockets, his blear eyes taking in the new-comers with a look of contemptuous hostility.
As they passed, he spat tobacco juice on the dog and across the feet of the men.

Old Warren who kept the store was not partial to Indians, but he was a good friend of Hendrik
and very keen to trade for fur, so the new trappers were well received; and now came the settling
of accounts. Flour, oatmeal, pork, potatoes, tea, tobacco, sugar, salt, powder, ball, shot,
clothes, lines, an inch-auger, nails, knives, awls, needles, files, another axe, some tin plates,
and a frying pan were selected and added to Hendrik's account.

"If I was you, I'd take a windy-sash; you'll find it mighty convenient in cold weather." The
store keeper led them into an outhouse where was a pile of six-lighted window-frames all complete.
So the awkward thing was added to their load.

"Can't I sell you a fine rifle?" and he took down a new, elegant small bore of the latest pattern.
"Only twenty-five dollars." Rolf shook his head; "part down, and I'll take the rest in fur
next spring." Rolf was sorely tempted; however, he had an early instilled horror of debt. He
steadfastly said: "No." But many times he regretted it afterward! The small balance remaining
was settled in cash.

As they were arranging and selecting, they heard a most hideous yelping outdoors, and a minute
later Skookum limped in, crying as if half-killed. Quonab was out in a moment.

"Did you kick my dog?"

The brutal loafer changed countenance as he caught the red man's eye. "Naw! never touched him;
hurted himself on that rake."

It was obviously a lie, but better to let it pass, and Quonab came in again.

Then the rough stranger appeared at the door and growled: "Say, Warren! ain't you going to
let me have that rifle? I guess my word's as good as the next man's."

"No," said Warren; "I told you, no!"

"Then you can go to blazes, and you'll never see a cent's worth of fur from the stuff I got
last year."

"I don't expect to," was the reply; "I've learned what your word's worth." And the stranger
slouched away.

"Who vas he?" asked Hendrik.

"I only know that his name is Jack Hoag; he's a little bit of a trapper and a big bit of a
bum; stuck me last year. He doesn't come out this way; they say he goes out by the west side
of the mountains."

New light on their course was secured from Warren, and above all, the important information
that the mouth of Jesup's River was marked by an eagle's nest in a dead pine. "Up to that point
keep the main stream, and don't forget next spring I'm buying fur."

The drive across Five-mile portage was slow. It took over two hours to cover it, but late that
day they reached the Schroon.

Here the Dutchman said "Good-bye: Coom again some noder time." Skookum saluted the farmer with
a final growl, then Rolf and Quonab were left alone in the wilderness.

It was after sundown, so they set about camping for the night. A wise camper always prepares
bed and shelter in daylight, if possible. While Rolf made a fire and hung the kettle, Quonab
selected a level, dry place between two trees, and covered it with spruce boughs to make the
beds, and last a low tent was made by putting the lodge cover over a pole between the trees.
The ends of the covers were held down by loose green logs quickly cut for the purpose, and
now they were safe against weather.

Tea, potatoes, and fried pork, with maple syrup and hard-tack, made their meal of the time,
after which there was a long smoke. Quonab took a stick of red willow, picked up-in the daytime,
and began shaving it toward one end, leaving the curling shreds still on the stick. When these
were bunched in a fuzzy mop, he held them over the fire until they were roasted brown; then,
grinding all up in his palm with some tobacco, and filling his pipe he soon was enveloped in
that odour of woodsy smoke called the "Indian smell," by many who do not know whence or how
it comes. Rolf did not smoke. He had promised his mother that he would not until he was a man,
and something brought her back home now with overwhelming force; that was the beds they had
made of fragrant balsam boughs. "Cho-ko-tung or blister tree" as Quonab called it. His mother
had a little sofa pillow, brought from the North--a "northern pine" pillow they called it,
for it was stuffed with pine needles of a kind not growing in Connecticut. Many a time had
Rolf as a baby pushed his little round nose into that bag to inhale the delicious odour it
gave forth, and so it became the hallowed smell of all that was dear in his babyhood, and it
never lost its potency. Smell never does. Oh, mighty aura! that, in marching by the nostrils,
can reach and move the soul; how wise the church that makes this power its handmaid, and through
its incense overwhelms all alien thought when the worshipper, wandering, doubting, comes again
to see if it be true, that here doubt dies. Oh, queen of memory that is master of the soul!
how fearful should we be of letting evil thought associated grow with some recurrent odour
that we love. Happy, indeed, are they that find some ten times pure and consecrated fragrance,
like the pine, which entering in is master of their moods, and yet through linking thoughts
has all its power, uplifting, full of sweetness and blessed peace. So came to Rolf his medicine
tree.

The balsam fir was his tree of hallowed memory. Its odour never failed, and he slept that night
with its influence all about him.

Starting in the morning was no easy matter. There was so much to be adjusted that first day.
Packs divided in two, new combinations to trim the canoe, or to raise such and such a package
above a possible leak. The heavy things, like axes and pans, had to be fastened to the canoe
or to packages that would float in case of an upset. The canoe itself had to be gummed in one
or two places; but they got away after three hours, and began the voyage down the Schroon.

This was Rolf's first water journey. He had indeed essayed the canoe on the Pipestave Pond,
but that was a mere ferry. This was real travel. He marvelled at the sensitiveness of the frail
craft; the delicacy of its balance; its quick response to the paddle; the way it seemed to
shrink from the rocks; and the unpleasantly suggestive bend-up of the ribs when the bottom
grounded upon a log. It was a new world for him. Quonab taught him never to enter the canoe
except when she was afloat; never to rise in her or move along without hold of the gunwale;
never to make a sudden move; and he also learned that it was easier to paddle when there were
six feet of water underneath than when only six inches.

In an hour they had covered the five miles that brought them to the Hudson, and here the real
labour began, paddling up stream. Before long they came to a shallow stretch with barely enough
water to float the canoe. Here they jumped out and waded in the stream, occasionally lifting
a stone to one side, till they reached the upper stretch of deep water and again went merrily
paddling. Soon they came to an impassable rapid, and Rolf had his first taste of a real carry
or portage. Quonab's eye was watching the bank as soon as the fierce waters appeared; for the
first question was, where shall we land? and the next, how far do we carry? There are no rapids
on important rivers in temperate America that have not been portaged more or less for ages.
No canoe man portages without considering most carefully when, where, and how to land. His
selection of the place, then, is the result of careful study. He cannot help leaving some mark
at the place, slight though it be, and the next man looks for that mark to save himself time
and trouble.

"Ugh" was the only sound that Rolf heard from his companion, and the canoe headed for a flat
rock in the pool below the rapids. After landing, they found traces of an old camp fire. It
was near noon now, so Rolf prepared the meal while Quonab took a light pack and went on to
learn the trail. It was not well marked; had not been used for a year or two, evidently, but
there are certain rules that guide one. The trail keeps near the water, unless there is some
great natural barrier, and it is usually the easiest way in sight. Quonab kept one eye on the
river, for navigable water was the main thing, and in about one hundred yards he was again
on the stream's edge, at a good landing above the rapid.

After the meal was finished and the Indian had smoked, they set to work. In a few loads each,
the stuff was portaged across, and the canoe was carried over and moored to the bank.

The cargo replaced, they went on again, but in half an hour after passing more shoal water,
saw another rapid, not steep, but too shallow to float the canoe, even with both men wading.
Here Quonab made what the Frenchmen call a demi-charge. He carried half the stuff to the bank;
then, wading, one at each end, they hauled the canoe up the portage and reloaded her above.
Another strip of good going was succeeded by a long stretch of very swift water that was two
or three feet deep and between shores that were densely grown with alders. The Indian landed,
cut two light, strong poles, and now, one at the bow, the other at the stern, they worked their
way foot by foot up the fierce current until safely on the upper level.

Yet one more style of canoe propulsion was forced on them. They came to a long stretch of smooth,
deep, very swift water, almost a rapid-one of the kind that is a joy when you are coming down
stream. It differed from the last in having shores that were not alder-hidden, but open gravel
banks. Now did Quonab take a long, strong line from his war sack. One end he fastened, not
to the bow, but to the forward part of the canoe, the other to a buckskin band which he put
across his breast. Then, with Rolf in the stern to steer and the Indian hauling on the bank,
the canoe was safely "tracked" up the "strong waters."

Thus they fought their way up the hard river, day after day, making sometimes only five miles
after twelve hours' toilsome travel. Rapids, shoals, portages, strong waters, abounded, and
before they had covered the fifty miles to the forks of Jesup's River, they knew right well
why the region was so little entered.

It made a hardened canoe man of Rolf, and when, on the evening of the fifth day, they saw a
huge eagle's nest in a dead pine tree that stood on the edge of a long swamp, both felt they
had reached their own country, and were glad.

Chapter 18. Animal Life Along the River

It must not be supposed that, because it has been duly mentioned, they saw no wild life along
the river. The silent canoe man has the best of opportunities. There were plenty of deer tracks
about the first camp, and that morning, as they turned up the Hudson, Rolf saw his first deer.
They had rounded a point in rather swift water when Quonab gave two taps on the gunwale, the
usual sign, "Look out," and pointed to the shore. There, fifty yards away on bank, gazing at
them, was a deer. Stock still he stood like a red statue, for he was yet in the red coat. With
three or four strong strokes, Quonab gave a long and mighty forward spurt; then reached for
his gun. But the deer's white flag went up. It turned and bounded away, the white flag the
last thing to disappear. Rolf sat spellbound. It was so sudden; so easy; it soon melted into
the woods again. He trembled after it was gone.

Many a time in the evening they saw muskrats in the eddies, and once they glimpsed a black,
shiny something like a monstrous leech rolling up and down as it travelled in the stream. Quonab
whispered, "Otter," and made ready his gun, but it dived and showed itself no more. At one
of the camps they were awakened by an extraordinary tattoo in the middle of the night--a harsh
rattle close by their heads; and they got up to find that a porcupine was rattling his teeth
on the frying-pan in an effort to increase the amount of salt that he could taste on it. Skookum,
tied to a tree, was vainly protesting against the intrusion and volunteered to make a public
example of the invader. The campers did not finally get rid of the spiny one till all their
kitchen stuff was hung beyond his reach.

Once they heard the sharp, short bark of a fox, and twice or thrice the soft, sweet, moaning
call of the gray wolf out to hunt. Wild fowl abounded, and their diet was varied by the ducks
that one or other of the hunters secured at nearly every camp.

On the second day they saw three deer, and on the third morning Quonab loaded his gun with
buckshot, to be ready, then sallied forth at dawn. Rolf was following, but the Indian shook
his head, then said: "Don't make fire for half an hour."

In twenty minutes Rolf heard the gun, then later the Indian returned with a haunch of venison,
and when they left that camp they stopped a mile up the river to add the rest of the venison
to their cargo. Seven other deer were seen, but no more killed; yet Rolf was burning to try
his hand as a hunter. Many other opportunities he had, and improved some of them. On one wood
portage he, or rather Skookum, put up a number of ruffed grouse. These perched in the trees
above their heads and the travellers stopped. While the dog held their attention Rolf with
blunt arrows knocked over five that proved most acceptable as food. But his thoughts were now
on deer, and his ambition was to go out alone and return with a load of venison.

Another and more thrilling experience followed quickly. Rounding a bend in the early dawn they
sighted a black bear and two cubs rambling along the gravelly bank and stopping now and then
to eat something that turned out to be crayfish.

Quonab had not seen a bear since childhood, when he and his father hunted along the hardwood
ridges back of Myanos, and now he was excited. He stopped paddling, warned Rolf to do the same,
and let the canoe drift backward until out of sight; then made for the land. Quickly tying
up the canoe he took his gun and Rolf his hunting arrows, and, holding Skookum in a leash,
they dashed into the woods. Then, keeping out of sight, they ran as fast and as silently as
possible in the direction of the bears. Of course, the wind was toward the hunters, or they
never could have got so near. Now they were opposite the family group and needed only a chance
for a fair shot. Sneaking forward with the utmost caution, they were surely within twenty-five
yards, but still the bushes screened the crab-eaters. As the hunters sneaked, the old bear
stopped and sniffed suspiciously; the wind changed, she got an unmistakable whiff; then gave
a loud warning "Koff! Koff! Koff! Koff!" and ran as fast as she could. The hunters knowing
they were discovered rushed out, yelling as loudly as possible, in hopes of making the bears
tree. The old bear ran like a horse with Skookum yapping bravely in her rear. The young ones,
left behind, lost sight of her, and, utterly bewildered by the noise, made for a tree conveniently
near and scrambled up into the branches. "Now," Rolf thought, judging by certain tales he had
heard, "that old bear will come back and there will be a fight."

"Is she coming back?" he asked nervously.

The Indian laughed. "No, she is running yet. Black bear always a coward; they never fight when
they can run away."

The little ones up the tree were, of course, at the mercy of the hunters, and in this case
it was not a broken straw they depended on, but an ample salvation. "We don't need the meat
and can't carry it with us; let's leave them," said Rolf, but added, "Will they find their mother?"

"Yes, bime-by; they come down and squall all over woods. She will hang round half a mile away
and by night all will be together."

Their first bear hunt was over. Not a shot fired, not a bear wounded, not a mile travelled,
and not an hour lost. And yet it seemed much more full of interesting thrills than did any
one of the many stirring bear hunts that Rolf and Quonab shared together in the days that were
to come.

Chapter 19. The Footprint on the Shore

Jesup's River was a tranquil stream that came from a region of swamps, and would have been
easy canoeing but for the fallen trees. Some of these had been cut years ago, showing that
the old trapper had used this route. Once they were unpleasantly surprised by seeing a fresh
chopping on the bank, but their mourning was changed into joy when they found it was beaver-work.

Ten miles they made that day. In the evening they camped on the shore of Jesup's Lake, proud
and happy in the belief that they were the rightful owners of it all. That night they heard
again and again the howling of wolves, but it seemed on the far side of the lake. In the morning
they went out on foot to explore, and at once had the joy of seeing five deer, while tracks
showed on every side. It was evidently a paradise for deer, and there were in less degree the
tracks of other animals--mink in fair abundance, one or two otters, a mountain lion, and a
cow moose with her calf. It was thrilling to see such a feast of possibilities. The hunters
were led on and on, revelling in the prospect of many joys before them, when all at once they
came on something that turned their joy to grief--the track of a man; the fresh imprint of
a cowhide boot. It was maddening. At first blush, it meant some other trapper ahead of them
with a prior claim to the valley; a claim that the unwritten law would allow. They followed
it a mile. It went striding along the shore at a great pace, sometimes running, and keeping
down the west shore. Then they found a place where he had sat down and broken a lot of clam
shells, and again had hastened on. But there was no mark of gunstock or other weapon where
he sat; and why was he wearing boots? The hunters rarely did.

For two miles the Indian followed with Rolf, and sometimes found that the hated stranger had
been running hard. Then they turned back, terribly disappointed. At first it seemed a crushing
blow. They had three courses open to them--to seek a location farther north, to assume that
one side of the lake was theirs, or to find out exactly who and what the stranger was. They
decided on the last. The canoe was launched and loaded, and they set out to look for what they
hoped they would not find, a trapper's shanty on the lake.

After skirting the shore for four or five miles and disturbing one or two deer, as well as
hosts of ducks, the voyagers landed and there still they found that fateful bootmark steadily
tramping southward. By noon they had reached the south end of the west inlet that leads to
another lake, and again an examination of the shore showed the footmarks, here leaving the
lake and going southerly. Now the travellers retired to the main lake and by noon had reached
the south end. At no point had they seen any sign of a cabin, though both sides of the lake
were in plain view all day. The travelling stranger was a mystery, but he did not live here
and there was no good reason why they should not settle.

Where? The country seemed equally good at all points, but it is usually best to camp on an
outlet. Then when a storm comes up, the big waves do not threaten your canoe, or compel you
to stay on land. It is a favourite crossing for animals avoiding the lake, and other trappers
coming in are sure to see your cabin before they enter.

Which side of the outlet? Quonab settled that--the west. He wanted to see the sun rise, and,
not far back from the water, was a hill with a jutting, rocky pinnade. He pointed to this and
uttered the one word, "Idaho." Here, then, on the west side, where the lake enters the river,
they began to clear the ground for their home.

Chapter 20. The Trappers' Cabin

     It's a smart fellow that knows what he can't do.--Sayings of
     Si Sylvanne.

I suppose every trapper that ever lived, on first building a cabin, said, "Oh, any little thing
will do, so long as it has a roof and is big enough to lie down in." And every trapper has
realized before spring that he made a sad mistake in not having it big enough to live in and
store goods in. Quonab and Rolf were new at the business, and made the usual mistake. They
planned their cabin far too small; 10 X 12 ft., instead of 12 X 20 ft. they made it, and 6-ft.
walls, instead of 8-ft. walls. Both were expert axemen. Spruce was plentiful and the cabin
rose quickly. In one day the walls were up. An important thing was the roof. What should it
be? Overlapping basswood troughs, split shingles, also called shakes, or clay? By far the easiest
to make, the warmest in winter and coolest in summer, is the clay roof. It has three disadvantages:
It leaks in long-continued wet weather; it drops down dust and dirt in dry weather; and is
so heavy that it usually ends by crushing in the log rafters and beams, unless they are further
supported on posts, which are much in the way. But its advantages were so obvious that the
builders did not hesitate. A clay roof it was to be.

When the walls were five feet high, the doorway and window were cut through the logs, but leaving
in each case one half of the log at the bottom of the needed opening. The top log was now placed,
then rolled over bottom up, while half of its thickness was cut away to fit over the door:
a similar cut out was made over the window. Two flat pieces of spruce were prepared for door
jambs and two shorter ones for window jambs. Auger holes were put through, so as to allow an
oak pin to be driven through the jamb into each log, and the doorway and window opening were done.

In one corner they planned a small fireplace, built of clay and stone. Not stone from the lake,
as Rolf would have had it, but from the hillside; and why? Quonab said that the lake stone
was of the water spirits, and would not live near fire, but would burst open; while the hillside
stone was of the sun and fire spirit, and in the fire would add its heat.

The facts are that lake stone explodes when greatly heated and hill stone does not; and since
no one has been able to improve upon Quonab's explanation, it must stand for the present.

The plan of the fireplace was simple. Rolf had been present at the building of several, and
the main point was to have the chimney large enough, and the narrowest point just above the fire.

The eaves logs, end logs, and ridge logs were soon in place; then came the cutting of small
poles, spruce and tamarack, long enough to reach from ridge to eaves, and in sufficient number
to completely cover the roof. A rank sedge meadow near by afforded plenty of coarse grass with
which the poles were covered deeply; and lastly clay dug out with a couple of hand-made, axe-hewn
wooden spades was thrown evenly on the grass to a depth of six inches; this, when trampled
flat, made a roof that served them well.

The chinks of the logs when large were filled with split pieces of wood; when small they were
plugged with moss. A door was made of hewn planks, and hinged very simply on two pins; one
made by letting the plank project as a point, the other by nailing on a pin after the door
was placed; both pins fitting, of course, into inch auger holes.

A floor was not needed, but bed bunks were, and in making these they began already to realize
that the cabin was too small. But now after a week's work it was done. It had a sweet fragrance
of wood and moss, and the pleasure it gave to Rolf at least was something he never again could
expect to find in equal measure about any other dwelling he might make.

Quonab laid the fire carefully, then lighted his pipe, sang a little crooning song about the
"home spirits," which we call "household gods," walked around the shanty, offering the pipestem
to each of the four winds in turn, then entering lighted the fire from his pipe, threw some
tobacco and deer hair on the blaze, and the house-warming was ended.

Nevertheless, they continued to sleep in the tent they had used all along, for Quonab loved
not the indoors, and Rolf was growing daily more of his mind.

Chapter 21. Rolf's First Deer

Anxious to lose no fine day they had worked steadily on the shanty, not even going after the
deer that were seen occasionally over the lake, so that now they were out of fresh meat, and
Rolf saw a chance he long had looked for. "Quonab, I want to go out alone and get a deer, and
I want your gun.

"Ugh! you shall go. To-night is good."

"To-night" meant evening, so Rolf set out alone as soon as the sun was low, for during the
heat of the day the deer are commonly lying in some thicket. In general, he knew enough to
travel up wind, and to go as silently as possible. The southwest wind was blowing softly, and
so he quickened his steps southwesterly which meant along the lake. Tracks and signs abounded;
it was impossible to follow any one trail. His plan was to keep on silently, trusting to luck,
nor did he have long to wait. Across a little opening of the woods to the west he saw a movement
in the bushes, but it ceased, and he was in doubt whether the creature, presumably a deer,
was standing there or had gone on. "Never quit till you are sure," was one of Quonab's wise
adages. Rolf was bound to know what it was that had moved. So he stood still and waited. A
minute passed; another; many; a long time; and still he waited, but got no further sign of
life from the bush. Then he began to think he was mistaken; yet it was good huntercraft to
find out what that was. He tried the wind several times, first by wetting his finger, which
test said "southwest"; second, by tossing up some handfuls of dried grass, which said "yes,
southwest, but veering southerly in this glade." So he knew he might crawl silently to the
north side of that bush. He looked to the priming of his gun and began a slow and stealthy
stalk, selecting such openings as might be passed without effort or movement of bushes or likelihood
of sound. He worked his way step by step; each time his foot was lifted he set it down again
only after trying the footing. At each step he paused to look and listen. It was only one hundred
yards to the interesting spot, but Rolf was fifteen minutes in covering the distance, and more
than once, he got a great start as a chicadee flew out or a woodpecker tapped. His heart beat
louder and louder, so it seemed everything near must hear; but he kept on his careful stalk,
and at last had reached the thicket that had given him such thrills and hopes. Here he stood
and watched for a full minute. Again he tried the wind, and proceeded to circle slowly to the
west of the place.

After a long, tense crawl of twenty yards he came on the track and sign of a big buck, perfectly
fresh, and again his heart worked harder; it seemed to be pumping his neck full of blood, so
he was choking. He judged it best to follow this hot trail for a time, and holding his gun
ready cocked he stepped softly onward. A bluejay cried out, "jay, jay!" with startling loudness,
and seemingly enjoyed his pent-up excitement. A few steps forward at slow, careful stalk, and
then behind him he heard a loud whistling hiss. Instantly turning he found himself face to
face with a great, splendid buck in the short blue coat. There not thirty yards away he stood,
the creature he had been stalking so long, in plain view now, broadside on. They gazed each
at the other, perfectly still for a few seconds, then Rolf without undue movement brought the
gun to bear, and still the buck stood gazing. The gun was up, but oh, how disgustingly it wabbled
and shook! and the steadier Rolf tried to bold it, the more it trembled, until from that wretched
gun the palsy spread all over his body; his breath came tremulously, his legs and arms were
shaking, and at last, as the deer moved its head to get a better view and raised its tail,
the lad, making an effort at selfcontrol, pulled the trigger. Bang! and the buck went lightly
bounding out of sight.

Poor Rolf; how disgusted he felt; positively sick with self-contempt. Thirty yards, standing,
broadside on, full daylight, a big buck, a clean miss. Yes, there was the bullet hole in a
tree, five feet above the deer's head. "I'm no good; I'll never be a hunter," he groaned, then
turned and slowly tramped back to camp. Quonab looked inquiringly, for, of course, he heard
the shot. He saw a glum and sorry-looking youth, who in response to his inquiring look gave
merely a head-shake, and hung up the gun with a vicious bang.

Quonab took down the gun, wiped it out, reloaded it, then turning to the boy said: "Nibowaka,
you feel pretty sick. Ugh! You know why? You got a good chance, but you got buck fever. It
is always so, every one the first time. You go again to-morrow and you get your deer."

Rolf made no reply. So Quonab ventured, "You want me to go?" That settled it for Rolf; his
pride was touched.

"No; I'll go again in the morning."

In the dew time he was away once more on the hunting trail. There was no wind, but the southwest
was the likeliest to spring up. So he went nearly over his last night's track. He found it
much easier to go silently now when all the world was dew wet, and travelled quickly. Past
the fateful glade he went, noted again the tree torn several feet too high up, and on. Then
the cry of a bluejay rang out; this is often a notification of deer at hand. It always is warning
of something doing, and no wise hunter ignores it.

Rolf stood for a moment listening and peering. He thought he heard a scraping sound; then again
the bluejay, but the former ceased and the jay-note died in the distance. He crept cautiously
on again for a few minutes; another opening appeared. He studied this from a hiding place;
then far across he saw a little flash near the ground. His heart gave a jump; he studied the
place, saw again the flash and then made out the head of a deer, a doe that was lying in the
long grass. The flash was made by its ear shaking off a fly. Rolf looked to his priming, braced
himself, got fully ready, then gave a short, sharp whistle; instantly the doe rose to her feet;
then another appeared, a sinal one; then a young buck; all stood gazing his way.

Up went the gun, but again its muzzle began to wabble. Rolf lowered it, said grimly and savagely
to himself, "I will not shake this time." The deer stretched themselves and began slowly walking
toward the lake. All had disappeared but the buck. Rolf gave another whistle that turned the
antler-bearer to a statue. Controlling himself with a strong "I will," he raised the gun, held
it steadily, and fired. The buck gave a gathering spasm, a bound, and disappeared. Rolf felt
sick again with disgust, but he reloaded, then hastily went forward.

There was the deep imprint showing where the buck had bounded at the shot, but no blood. He
followed, and a dozen feet away found the next hoof marks and on them a bright-red stain; on
and another splash; and more and shortening bounds, till one hundred yards away--yes, there
it lay; the round, gray form, quite dead, shot through the heart.

Rolf gave a long, rolling war cry and got an answer from a point that was startlingly near,
and Quonab stepped from behind a tree.

"I got him," shouted Rolf.

The Indian smiled. "I knew you would, so I followed; last night I knew you must have your shakes,
so let you go it alone."

Very carefully that deer was skinned, and Rolf learned the reason for many little modes of
procedure.

After the hide was removed from the body (not the hand or legs), Quonab carefully cut out the-broad
sheath of tendon that cover the muscles, beginning at the hip bones on the back and extending
up to the shoulders; this is the sewing sinew. Then he cut out the two long fillets of meat
that lie on each side of the spine outside (the loin) and the two smaller ones inside (the
tenderloin).

These, with the four quarters, the heart, and the kidneys, were put into the hide. The entrails,
head, neck, legs, feet, he left for the foxes, but the hip bone or sacrum he hung in a tree
with three little red yarns from them, so that the Great Spirit would be pleased and send good
hunting. Then addressing the head he said: "Little brother, forgive us. We are sorry to kill
you. Behold! we give you the honour of red streamers." Then bearing the rest they tramped back
to camp.

The meat wrapped in sacks to keep off the flies was hung in the shade, but the hide he buried
in the warm mud of a swamp hole, and three days later, when the hair began to slip, he scraped
it clean. A broad ash wood hoop he had made ready and when the green rawhide was strained on
it again the Indian had an Indian drum.

It was not truly dry for two or three days and as it tightened on its frame it gave forth little
sounds of click and shrinkage that told of the strain the tensioned rawhide made. Quonab tried
it that night as he sat by the fire softly singing:

"Ho da ho-he da he."

But the next day before sunrise he climbed the hill and sitting on the sun-up rock he hailed
the Day God with the invocation, as he had not sung it since the day they left the great rock
above the Asalnuk, and followed with the song:

"Father, we thank thee; We have found the good hunting. There is meat in the wigwam."

Chapter 22. The Line of Traps

Now that they had the cabin for winter, and food for the present, they must set about the serious
business of trapping and lay a line of deadfalls for use in the coming cold weather. They were
a little ahead of time, but it was very desirable to get their lines blazed through the woods
in all proposed directions in case of any other trapper coming in. Most fur-bearing animals
are to be found along the little valleys of the stream: beaver, otter, mink, muskrat, coon,
are examples. Those that do not actually live by the water seek these places because of their
sheltered character and because their prey lives there; of this class are the lynx, fox, fisher,
and marten that feed on rabbits and mice. Therefore a line of traps is usually along some valley
and over the divide and down some other valley back to the point of beginning.

So, late in September, Rolf and Quonab, with their bedding, a pot, food for four days, and
two axes, alternately followed and led by Skookum, set out along a stream that entered the
lake near their cabin. A quarter mile up they built their first deadfall for martens. It took
them one hour and was left unset. The place was under a huge tree on a neck of land around
which the stream made a loop. This tree they blazed on three sides. Two hundred yards up another
good spot was found and a deadfall made. At one place across a neck of land was a narrow trail
evidently worn by otters. "Good place for steel trap, bime-by," was Quonab's remark.

From time to time they disturbed deer, and in a muddy place where a deer path crossed the creek,
they found, among the numerous small hoof prints, the track of wolves, bears, and a mountain
lion, or panther. At these little Skookum sniffed fearsomely, and showed by his bristly mane
that he was at least much impressed.

After five hours' travel and work they came to another stream joining on, and near the angle
of the two little valleys they found a small tree that was chewed and scratched in a remarkable
manner for three to six feet up. "Bear tree," said Quonab, and by degrees Rolf got the facts
about it.

The bears, and indeed most animals, have a way of marking the range that they consider their
own. Usually this is done by leaving their personal odour at various points, covering the country
claimed, but in some cases visible marks are added. Thus the beaver leaves a little dab of
mud, the wolf scratches with his hind feet, and the bear tears the signal tree with tooth and
claw. Since this is done from time to time, when the bear happens to be near the tree, it is
kept fresh as long as the region is claimed. But it is especially done in midsummer when the
bears are pairing, and helps them to find suitable companions, nor all are then roaming the
woods seeking mates; all call and leave their mark on the sign post, so the next bear, thanks
to his exquisite nose, can tell at once the sex of the bear that called last and by its track
tell which way it travelled afterward.

In this case it was a bear's register, but before long Quonab showed Rolf a place where two
long logs joined at an angle by a tree that was rubbed and smelly, and showed a few marten
hairs, indicating that this was the sign post of a marten and a good place to make a deadfall.

Yet a third was found in an open, grassy glade, a large, white stone on which were pellets
left by foxes. The Indian explained:

"Every fox that travels near will come and smell the stone to see who of his kind is around,
so this is a good place for a fox-trap; a steel trap, of course, for no fox will go into a
deadfall."

And slowly Rolf learned that these habits are seen in some measure in all animals; yes, down
to the mice and shrews. We see little of it because our senses are blunt and our attention
untrained; but the naturalist and the hunter always know where to look for the four-footed
inhabitants and by them can tell whether or not the land is possessed by such and such a furtive
tribe.

Chapter 23. The Beaver Pond

AT THE noon halt they were about ten miles from home and had made fifteen deadfalls for marten,
for practice was greatly reducing the time needed for each.

In the afternoon they went on, but the creek had become a mere rill and they were now high
up in a more level stretch of country that was more or less swampy. As they followed the main
course of the dwindling stream, looking ever for signs of fur-bearers, they crossed and recrossed
the water. At length Quonab stopped, stared, and pointed at the rill, no longer clear but clouded
with mud. His eyes shone as he jerked his head up stream and uttered the magic word, "Beaver."

They tramped westerly for a hundred yards through a dense swamp of alders, and came at last
to an irregular pond that spread out among the willow bushes and was lost in the swampy thickets.
Following the stream they soon came to a beaver dam, a long, curving bank of willow branches
and mud, tumbling through the top of which were a dozen tiny streams that reunited their waters
below to form the rivulet they had been following.

Red-winged blackbirds were sailing in flocks about the pond; a number of ducks were to be seen,
and on a dead tree, killed by the backed up water, a great blue heron stood. Many smaller creatures
moved or flitted in the lively scene, while far out near the middle rose a dome-like pile of
sticks, a beaver lodge, and farther three more were discovered. No beaver were seen, but the
fresh cut sticks, the floating branches peeled of all the bark, and the long, strong dam in
good repair were enough to tell a practised eye that here was a large colony of beavers in
undisturbed possession.

In those days beaver was one of the most valued furs. The creature is very easy to trap; so
the discovery of the pond was like the finding of a bag of gold. They skirted its uncertain
edges and Quonab pointed out the many landing places of the beaver; little docks they seemed,
built up with mud and stones with deep water plunge holes alongside. Here and there on the
shore was a dome-shaped ant's nest with a pathway to it from the pond, showing, as the Indian
said, that here the beaver came on sunny days to lie on the hill and let the swarming ants
come forth and pick the vermin from their fur. At one high point projecting into the still
water they found a little mud pie with a very strong smell; this, the Indian said, was a "castor
cache," the sign that, among beavers, answers the same purpose as the bear tree among bears.

Although the pond seemed small they had to tramp a quarter of a mile before reaching the upper
end and here they found another dam, with its pond. This was at a slightly higher level and
contained a single lodge; after this they found others, a dozen ponds in a dozen successive
rises, the first or largest and the second only having lodges, but all were evidently part
of the thriving colony, for fresh cut trees were seen on every side. "Ugh, good; we get maybe
fifty beaver," said the Indian, and they knew they had reached the Promised Land.

Rolf would gladly have spent the rest of the day exploring the pond and trying for a beaver,
when the eventide should call them to come forth, but Quonab said, "Only twenty deadfall; we
should have one hundred and fifty." So making for a fine sugar bush on the dry ground west
of the ponds they blazed a big tree, left a deadfall there, and sought the easiest way over
the rough hills that lay to the east, in hopes of reaching the next stream leading down to
their lake.

Chapter 24. The Porcupine

Skookum was a partly trained little dog; he would stay in camp when told, if it suited him;
and would not hesitate to follow or lead his master, when he felt that human wisdom was inferior
to the ripe product of canine experience covering more than thirteen moons of recollection.
But he was now living a life in which his previous experience must often fail him as a guide.
A faint rustling on the leafy ground had sent him ahead at a run, and his sharp, angry bark
showed that some hostile creature of the woods had been discovered. Again and again the angry
yelping was changed into a sort of yowl, half anger, half distress. The hunters hurried forward
to find the little fool charging again and again a huge porcupine that was crouched with its
head under a log, its hindquarters exposed but bristling with spines; and its tail lashing
about, left a new array of quills in the dog's mouth and face each time he charged. Skookum
was a plucky fighter, but plainly he was nearly sick of it. The pain of the quills would, of
course, increase every minute and with each movement. Quonab took a stout stick and threw the
porcupine out of its retreat, (Rolf supposed to kill it when the head was exposed,) but the
spiny one, finding a new and stronger enemy, wasted no time in galloping at its slow lumbering
pace to the nearest small spruce tree and up that it scrambled to a safe place in the high
branches.

Now the hunters called the dog. He was a sorry-looking object, pawing at his muzzle, first
with one foot, then another, trying to unswallow the quills in his tongue, blinking hard, uttering
little painful grunts and whines as he rubbed his head upon the ground or on his forelegs.
Rolf held him while Quonab, with a sharp jerk, brought out quill after quill. Thirty or forty
of the poisonous little daggers were plucked from his trembling legs, head, face, and nostrils,
but the dreadful ones were those in his lips and tongue. Already they were deeply sunk in the
soft, quivering flesh. One by one those in the lips were with-drawn by the strong fingers of
the red man, and Skookum whimpered a little, but he shrieked outright when those in the tongue
were removed. Rolf had hard work to hold him, and any one not knowing the case might have thought
that the two men were deliberately holding the dog to administer the most cruel torture.

But none of the quills had sunk very deep. All were got out at last and the little dog set free.

Now Rolf thought of vengeance on the quill-pig snugly sitting in the tree near by.

Ammunition was too precious to waste, but Rolf was getting ready to climb when Quonab said:
"No, no; you must not. Once I saw white man climb after the Kahk; it waited till he was near,
then backed down, lashing its tail. He put up his arm to save his face. It speared his arm
in fifty places and he could not save his face, so he tried to get down, but the Kahk came
faster, lashing him; then he lost his hold and dropped. His leg was broken and his arm was
swelled up for half a year. They are very poisonous. He nearly died."

"Well, I can at least chop him down," and Rolf took the axe.

"Wah!" Quonab said, "no; my father said you must not kill the Kahk, except you make sacrifice
and use his quills for household work. It is bad medicine to kill the Kahk."

So the spiny one was left alone in the place he had so ably fought for. But Skookum, what of
him? He was set free at last. To be wiser? Alas, no! before one hour he met with another porcupine
and remembering only his hate of the creature repeated the same sad mistake, and again had
to have the painful help, without which he must certainly have died. Before night, however,
he began to feel his real punishment and next morning no one would have known the pudding-headed
thing that sadly followed the hunters, for the bright little dog that a day before had run
so joyously through the woods. It was many a long day before he fully recovered and at one
time his life was in the balance; and yet to the last of his days he never fully realized the
folly of his insensate attacks on the creature that fights with its tail.

"It is ever so," said the Indian. "The lynx, the panther, the wolf, the fox, the eagle, all
that attack the Kahk must die. Once my father saw a bear that was killed by the quills. He
had tried to bite the Kahk; it filled his mouth with quills that he could not spit out. They
sunk deeper and his jaws swelled so he could not open or shut his mouth to eat; then he starved.
My people found him near a fish pond below a rapid. There were many fish. The bear could kill
them with his paw but not eat, so with his mouth wide open and plenty about him he died of
starvation in that pool.

"There is but one creature that can kill the Kahk that is the Ojeeg the big fisher weasel.
He is a devil. He makes very strong medicine; the Kahk cannot harm him. He turns it on its
back and tears open its smooth belly. It is ever so. We not know, but my father said, that
it is because when in the flood Nana Bojou was floating on the log with Kahk and Ojeeg, Kahk
was insolent and wanted the highest place, but Ojeeg was respectful to Nana Bojou, he bit the
Kahk to teach him a lesson and got lashed with the tail of many stings. But the Manito drew
out the quills and said: 'It shall be ever thus; the Ojeeg shall conquer the Kahk and the quills
of Kahk shall never do Ojeeg any harm.'"

Chapter 25. The Otter Slide

It was late now and the hunters camped in the high cool woods. Skookum whined in his sleep
so loudly as to waken them once or twice. Near dawn they heard the howling of wolves and the
curiously similar hooting of a horned owl. There is, indeed, almost no difference between the
short opening howl of a she-wolf and the long hoot of the owl. As he listened, half awake,
Rolf heard a whirr of wings which stopped overhead, then a familiar chuckle. He sat up and
saw Skookum sadly lift his misshapen head to gaze at a row of black-breasted grouse partridge
on a branch above, but the poor doggie was feeling too sick to take any active interest. They
were not ruffed grouse, but a kindred kind, new to Rolf. As he gazed at the perchers, he saw
Quonab rise gently, go to nearest willow and cut a long slender rod at least two feet long;
on the top of this he made a short noose of cord. Then he went cautiously under the watching
grouse, the spruce partridges, and reaching up slipped the noose over the neck of the first
one; a sharp jerk then tightened noose, and brought the grouse tumbling out of the tree while
its companions merely clucked their puzzlement, made no effort to escape.

A short, sharp blow put the captive out of pain. The rod was reached again and a second, the
lowest always, was jerked down, and the trick repeated till three grouse were secured. Then
only did it dawn on the others that they were in a most perilous neighbourhood, so they took
flight.

Rolf sat up in amazement. Quonab dropped the three birds by the fire and set about preparing
breakfast.

"These are fool hens," he explained. "You can mostly get them this way; sure, if you have a
dog to help, but ruffed grouse is no such fool."

Rolf dressed the birds and as usual threw the entrails Skookum. Poor little dog! he was, indeed,
a sorry sight. He looked sadly out of his bulging eyes, feebly moved swollen jaws, but did
not touch the food he once would have pounced on. He did not eat because he could not open
his mouth.

At camp the trappers made a log trap and continued the line with blazes and deadfalls, until,
after a mile, they came to a broad tamarack swamp, and, skirting its edge, found a small, outflowing
stream that brought them to an eastward-facing hollow. Everywhere there were signs game, but
they were not prepared for the scene that opened as they cautiously pushed through the thickets
into a high, hardwood bush. A deer rose out of the grass and stared curiously at them; then
another and another until nearly a dozen were in sight; still farther many others appeared;
to the left were more, and movements told of yet others to the right. Then their white flags
went up and all loped gently away on the slope that rose to the north. There may have been
twenty or thirty deer in sight, but the general effect of all their white tails, bobbing away,
was that the woods were full of deer. They seemed to be there by the hundreds and the joy of
seeing so many beautiful live things was helped in the hunters by the feeling that this was
their own hunting-ground. They had, indeed, reached the land of plenty.

The stream increased as they marched; many springs and some important rivulets joined on. They
found some old beaver signs but none new; and they left their deadfalls every quarter mile or less.

The stream began to descend more quickly until it was in a long, narrow valley with steep clay
sides and many pools. Here they saw again and again the tracks and signs of otter and coming
quietly round a turn that opened a new reach they heard a deep splash, then another and another.

The hunters' first thought was to tie up Skookum, but a glance showed that this was unnecessary.
They softly dropped the packs and the sick dog lay meekly down beside them. Then they crept
forward with hunter caution, favoured by an easterly breeze. Their first thought was of beaver,
but they had seen no recent sign, nor was there anything that looked like a beaver pond. The
measured splash, splash, splash--was not so far ahead. It might be a bear snatching fish, or--no,
that was too unpleasant--a man baling out a canoe. Still the slow splash, splash, went on at
intervals, not quite regular.

Now it seemed but thirty yards ahead and in the creek.

With the utmost care they crawled to the edge of the clay and opposite they saw a sight but
rarely glimpsed by man. Here were six otters; two evidently full-grown, and four seeming young
of the pair, engaged in a most hilarious and human game of tobogganing down a steep clay hill
to plump into a deep part at its foot.

Plump went the largest, presumably the father; down he went, to reappear at the edge, scramble
out and up an easy slope to the top of the twenty-foot bank. Splash, splash, splash, came three
of the young ones; splash, splash, the mother and one of the cubs almost together.

"Scoot" went the big male again, and the wet furslopping and rubbing on the long clay chute
made it greasier and slipperier every time.

Splash, plump, splash--splash, plump, splash, went the otter family gleefully, running up the
bank again, eager each to be first, it seemed, and to do the chute the oftenest.

The gambolling grace, the obvious good humour, the animal hilarity of it all, was absorbingly
amusing. The trappers gazed with pleasure that showed how near akin are naturalist and hunter.
Of course, they had some covetous thought connected with those glossy hides, but this was September
still, and even otter were not yet prime. Shoot, plump, splash, went the happy crew with apparently
unabated joy and hilarity. The slide improved with use and the otters seemed tireless; when
all at once a loud but muffled yelp was heard and Skookum, forgetting all caution, came leaping
down the bank to take a hand.

With a succession of shrill, birdy chirps the old otters warned their young. Plump, plump,
plump, all shot into the pool, but to reappear, swimming with heads out, for they were but
slightly alarmed. This was too much for Quonob; he levelled his flintlock; snap, bang, it went,
pointed at the old male, but he dived at the snap and escaped. Down the bank now rushed the
hunters, joined by Skookum, to attack the otters in the pool, for it was small and shallow;
unless a burrow led from it, they were trapped.

But the otters realized the peril. All six dashed out of the pool, down the open, gravelly
stream the old ones uttering loud chirps that rang like screams. Under the fallen logs and
brush they glided, dodging beneath roots and over banks, pursued by the hunters, each armed
with a club and by Skookum not armed at all.

The otters seemed to know where they were going and distanced all but the dog. Forgetting his
own condition Skookum had almost overtaken one of the otter cubs when the mother wheeled about
and, hissing and snarling, charged. Skookum was lucky to get off with a slight nip, for the
otter is a dangerous fighter. But the unlucky dog was sent howling back to the two packs that
he never should have left.

The hunters now found an open stretch of woods through which Quonab could run ahead and intercept
the otters as they bounded on down the stream bed, pursued by Rolf, who vainly tried to deal
a blow with his club. In a few seconds the family party was up to Quonab, trapped it seemed,
but there is no more desperate assailant than an otter fighting for its young. So far from
being cowed the two old ones made a simultaneous, furious rush at the Indian. Wholly taken
by surprise, he missed with his club, and sprang aside to escape their jaws. The family dashed
around then past him, and, urged by the continuous chirps of the mother, they plunged under
a succession of log jams and into a willow swamp that spread out into an ancient beaver lake
and were swallowed up in the silent wilderness.

Chapter 26. Back to the Cabin

The far end of the long swamp the stream emerged, now much larger, and the trappers kept on
with their work. When night fell they had completed fifty traps, all told, and again they camped
without shelter overhead.

Next day Skookum was so much worse that they began to fear for his life. He had eaten nothing
since the sad encounter. He could drink a little, so Rolf made a pot of soup, and when it was
cool the poor doggie managed to swallow some of the liquid after half an hour's patient endeavour.

They were now on the home line; from a hill top they got a distant view of their lake, though
it was at least five miles away. Down the creek they went, still making their deadfalls at
likely places and still seeing game tracks at the muddy spots. The creek came at length to
an extensive, open, hardwood bush, and here it was joined by another stream that came from
the south, the two making a small river. From then on they seemed in a land of game; trails
of deer were seen on the ground everywhere, and every few minutes they started one or two deer.
The shady oak wood itself was flanked and varied with dense cedar swamps such as the deer love
to winter in, and after they had tramped through two miles of it, the Indian said, "Good! now
we know where to come in winter when we need meat."

At a broad, muddy ford they passed an amazing number of tracks, mostly deer, but a few of panther,
lynx, fisher, wolf, otter, and mink.

In the afternoon they reached the lake. The stream, quite a broad one here, emptied in about
four miles south of the camp. Leaving a deadfall near its mouth they followed the shore and
made a log trap every quarter mile just above the high water mark.

When they reached the place of Rolf's first deer they turned aside to see it. The gray jays
had picked a good deal of the loose meat. No large animal had troubled it, and yet in the neighbourhood
they found the tracks of both wolves and foxes.

"Ugh," said Quonab, "they smell it and come near, but they know that a man has been here; they
are not very hungry, so keep away. This is good for trap."

So they made two deadfalls with the carrion half way between them. Then one or two more traps
and they reached home, arriving at the camp just as darkness and a heavy rainfall began.

"Good," said Quonab, "our deadfalls are ready; we have done all the work our fingers could
not do when the weather is very cold, and the ground too hard for stakes to be driven. Now
the traps can get weathered before we go round and set them. Yet we need some strong medicine,
some trapper charm."

Next morning he went forth with fish-line and fish-spear; he soon returned with a pickerel.
He filled a bottle with cut-up shreds of this, corked it up, and hung it on the warm, sunny
side of the shanty. "That will make a charm that every bear will come to," he said, and left
it to the action of the sun.

Chapter 27. Sick Dog Skookum

Getting home is always a joy; but walking about the place in the morning they noticed several
little things that were wrong. Quonab's lodge was down, the paddles that stood against the
shanty were scattered on the ground, and a bag of venison hung high at the ridge was opened
and empty.

Quonab studied the tracks and announced "a bad old black bear; he has rollicked round for mischief,
upsetting things. But the venison he could not reach; that was a marten that ripped open the bag."

"Then that tells what we should do; build a storehouse at the end of the shanty," said Rolf,
adding, "it must be tight and it must be cool."

"Maybe! sometime before winter," said the Indian; "but now we should make another line of traps
while the weather is fine."

"No," replied the lad, "Skookum is not fit to travel now. We can't leave him behind, and we
can make a storehouse in three days." 

At thirty- seven life is very sweet, many things still seem possible, and before him, could his life
be spared, Walker beheld greater conquests, more power, a new South
controlling a Nicaragua canal, a network of busy railroads, great
squadrons of merchant vessels, himself emperor of Central America.

On the gunboat the gold- braided youth had but to raise his hand, and Walker again would be a free man.
But the gold- braided one would render this service only on the condition that Walker would appeal to
him as an American; it was not enough that Walker was a human being.
The condition Walker could not grant."

The President of Nicaragua," he said," is a citizen of Nicaragua."

They led him out at sunrise to a level piece of sand along the beach,
and as the priest held the crucifix in front of him he spoke to his
executioners in Spanish, simply and gravely:" I die a Roman Catholic.
In making war upon you at the invitation of the people of Ruatan
I was wrong. Of your people I ask pardon. I accept my punishment
with resignation.

I would like to think my death will be for the good of society."

From a distance of twenty feet three soldiers fired at him, but, although
each shot took effect, Walker was not dead. So, a sergeant stooped, and
with a pistol killed the man who would have made him one of an empire
of slaves.

Had Walker lived four years longer to exhibit upon the great board of the Civil War his ability as a
general, he would, I believe, to- day be ranked as one of America'
s greatest fighting men.

And because the people of his own day destroyed him is no reason that we should
withhold from this American, the greatest of all filibusters, the recognition
of his genius.

MAJOR BURNHAM, CHIEF OF SCOUTS AMONG the Soldiers of Fortune whose
stories have been told in this book were men who are no longer living,
men who, to the United States, are strangers, and men who were of
interest chiefly because in what they attempted they failed.

The subject of this article is none of these. His adventures are as
remarkable as any that ever led a small boy to dig behind the barn for
buried treasure, or stalk Indians in the orchard. But entirely apart
from his adventures he obtains our interest because in what he has
attempted he has not failed, because he is one of our own people,
one of the earliest and best types of American, and because, so far
from being dead and buried, he is at this moment very much alive,
and engaged in Mexico in for a buried city.

For exercise, he is alternately chasing, or being chased by, Yaqui
Indians.

In his home in Pasadena, Cal., where sometimes he rests quietly for almost a week at a time, the neighbors
know him as" Fred" Burnham. In England the newspapers crowned him" The King of Scouts." Later, when
he won an official title, they called him" Major Frederick s freight outfits, which in those days hauled
bullion from Cerro Gordo for the man who is now Senator Jones of Nevada. At nineteen Burnham decided that
there were things in this Russell Burnham, D. S. O." Some men are born
scouts, others by training become scouts. From his father Burnham
inherited his instinct for wood- craft, and to this instinct, which
in him is as keen as in a wild deer or a mountain lion, he has added,
in the jungle and on the prairie and mountain ranges, years of the
hardest, most relentless schooling.

In those years he has trained himself to endure the most appalling
fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds; has subdued the brain to infinite patience,
has learned to force every nerve in his body to absolute obedience,
to still even the beating of his heart. Indeed, than Burnham no man
of my acquaintance to my knowledge has devoted himself to his life'
s work more earnestly, more honestly, and with such single- mindedness
of purpose.

To him scouting is as exact a study as is the piano to Paderewski, with the result that to- day what
the Pole is to other pianists, the American is to all other" trackers," woodmen, and scouts.
He reads" the face of Nature" as you read your morning paper. To him a movement of
his horse' s ears is as plain a warning as the" Go SLOW" of an automobile
sign; and he so saves from ambush an entire troop. In the glitter of a
piece of quartz in the firelight he discovers King Solomon' s mines.
Like the horned cattle, he can tell by the smell of it in the air the
near presence of water, and where, glaring in the sun, you can see
only a bare kopje, he distinguishes the muzzle of a pompom, the crown
of a Boer sombrero, the levelled barrel of a Mauser.

He is the Sherlock Holmes of all out- of- doors. Besides being a scout, he is soldier, hunter, mining
expert, and explorer. Within the last ten years the educated instinct that as a
younger man taught him to follow the trail of an Indian, or the" spoor" of
the Kaffir and the key trek wagon, now leads him as a mining expert to the
hiding on the bridle rein," as is witnessed by the fact that for
nine years after his marriage Burnham continued his career as sheriff,
scout,- places of copper, silver, and gold, and, as he advises, great
and wealthy syndicates buy or refuse tracts of land in Africa and
Mexico as large as the State of New York.

As an explorer
in the last few years in the course of his expeditions into undiscovered lands, he has added to this
little world many thousands of square miles. Personally, Burnham is as unlike the scout of fiction, and
of the Wild West Show, as it is possible for a man to be. He possesses no
flowing locks, his talk is not of" greasers,"" grizzly b' ars," or"
pesky redskins."

In fact, because he is more widely and more thoroughly informed, he is much better educated than
many who have passed through one of the" Big Three" universities, and his
English is as conventional as though he had been brought up on the borders
of Boston Common, rather than on the borders of civilization.

In appearance he is slight, muscular, bronzed; with a finely formed
square jaw, and remarkable light blue eyes.

These eyes apparently never arrive yours, but in reality they see everything
behind you and about you, above would not strike the trail of the bandit
or" bad babu" until the other had several days the start of him. But
the end was the same; for, while the murderer snatched a few Burnham
said:" Don' t raise your head, sit. On that kopje to the right there
is a commando of Boers."" When did you see them?" asked the officer."
I see them now," Burnham answered."

But I thought you were looking for a lost trail?"" That' s what the Boers on the kopje think," said Burnham.
In his eyes, possibly, owing to the uses to which they have been
trained, the pupils, as in the eyes of animals that see in the dark,
are extremely small.

Even in the photographs that accompany this article this feature of his eyes
is obvious, and that he can see in the dark the Kaffirs of South
Africa firmly believe.

In manner he is quiet, courteous, talking slowly but well, and, while
without any of that shyness that comes from self- consciousness, extremely
modest. Indeed, there could be no better proof of his modesty than the difficulties
I have encountered in gathering material for this article, which I have
been five years in collecting. And even now, as he reads it by his
camp- fire, I can see him squirm with embarrassment.

Burnham' s father was a pioneer missionary in a frontier hamlet called Tivoli on the edge of the
Indian reserve of Minnesota.

He was a stern, severely religious man, born in Kentucky, but educated in New York, where he graduated
from the Union Theological Seminary. He was wonderfully skilled in wood- craft. Burnham' s mother was
a Miss Rebecca Russell of a well- known family in Iowa. She was a woman of great courage, which,
in those days on that skirmish line of civilization, was a very necessary
virtue; and she was possessed of a most gentle and sweet disposition.
That was her gift to her son Fred, who was born on May 11, 1861.

His education as a child consisted in memorizing many verses of the
Bible, the"

Three R' s," and wood- craft.

His childhood was strenuous.

In his mother' s arms he saw the burning of the town of New Ulm,
which was the funeral pyre for the women and children of that place
when they were massacred by Red Cloud and his braves.

On another occasion Fred' s mother fled for her life from the Indians,
carrying the boy with her.

He was a husky lad, and knowing that if she tried to carry him farther they both
would be overtaken, she hid him under a shock of corn. There, the next
morning, the Indians having been driven off, she found her son sleeping
as soundly as a night watchman. In these Indian wars, and the Civil
War which followed, of the families of Burnham and Russell, twenty-
two of the and men were killed.

There is no question that Burnham comes of fighting stock. In 1870, when
Fred was nine years old, his father moved to Los Angeles, Cal., where two
years later he died; and for a time for both mother and boy there
was poverty, hard and grinding.

To relieve
this young Burnham acted as a mounted messenger. Often he was in the saddle from twelve to fifteen
hours, and even in a land where every one rode well, he gained local
fame as a hard rider.

In a few years a kind uncle offered to Mrs. Burnham and a younger
brother a home in the East, but at the last moment Fred refused to
go with them, and chose to make his own way.

He was then thirteen years old, and he had determined to be a scout. At that particular age many boys
have set forth determined to be scouts, and are generally brought home the next morning by a policeman.
But Burnham, having turned his back on the cities, did not repent. He wandered over Mexico, Arizona, California.
He met Indians, bandits, prospectors, hunters of all kinds of big game; and finally a scout who,
under General Taylor, had served in the Mexican War. This man took a liking to the boy; and his
influence upon him was marked and for his good.

He was an educated man, and had carried into the wilderness a few
books.

In the cabin of this man Burnham read" The Conquest of Mexico and Peru" by Prescott, the lives
of Hannibal and Cyrus the Great, of Livingstone the explorer, which first set his thoughts toward
Africa, and many technical works on the strategy and tactics of war.
He had no experience of military operations on a large scale, but,
with the aid of the veteran of the Mexican War, with corn- cobs in
the sand in front of the cabin door, he constructed forts and made
trenches, redoubts, and traverses.

In Burnham' s life this seems to have been a very happy period. The big
game he hunted and killed he sold for a few dollars to the men of
Nadean' and world he should know that could not be gleaned from the
earth, trees, and sky; and with the few dollars he had saved he came
East.

The visit apparently was not a success. The atmosphere of the town in which he went to school was strictly
Puritanical, and the townspeople much given to religious discussion. The son of the pioneer missionary
found himself unable to subscribe to the formulas which to the others
seemed so essential, and he returned to the West with the most bitter
feelings, which lasted until he was twenty- one."

It seems strange now," he once said to me," but in those times religious questions were as much
a part of our daily life as to- day are automobiles, the Standard
Oil, and the insurance scandals, and when I went West I was in an
unhappy, doubting frame of mind.

The trouble was I had no moral anchors; the old ones father had given me were gone, and the time for acquiring
new ones had not arrived." This bitterness of heart, or this disappointment,
or whatever the state of mind was that the dogmas of the New England
town had inspired in the boy from the prairie, made him reckless.

For the life he was to lead this was not a handicap. Even as a lad, in a land- grant war in California,
he had been under gunfire, and for the next fifteen years he led a life
of danger and of daring; and studied in a school of experience than
which, for a scout, if his life be spared, there can be none better.
Burnham came out of it a quiet, manly, gentleman. In those fifteen
years he roved the West from the Great Divide to Mexico.

He fought the Apache Indians for the possession of waterholes, he
guarded bullion on stage- me coaches, for days rode in pursuit of
Mexican bandits and American horse thieves, took part in county- seat
fights, in rustler wars, in cattle wars; he was cowboy, miner, deputy-
sheriff, and in time throughout the the name of"

Fred" Burnham became significant familiar. During this period Burnham was
true to his boyhood ideal of becoming a scout.

It was not enough that by merely living the life around him he was
being educated for it.

He daily practised and rehearsed those things which some day might mean
to himself and others the difference between life and death. To improve
his sense of smell he gave up smoking, of which he was extremely
fond, nor, for the same reason, does he to this day use tobacco.

He accustomed himself also to go with little sleep, and to subsist on the
least possible quantity of food. As a hours' rest by the trail, Burnham,
awake and in the saddle, would be closing up the miles between them.

That he
is a good marksman goes without telling. At the age of eight his father gave
him a rifle of his own, and at twelve, with either a rustled" gun" or a
Winchester, he was an expert. He taught himself to use a weapon either
in his left or right hand and to shoot, Indian fashion, hanging by
one leg from his pony and using it as a cover, and to turn in the
saddle and shoot behind him.

I once asked him if he really could shoot to the rear with a galloping
horse under him and hit a man." Well," he said," maybe not to hit
him, but I can come near enough to him to make him decide my pony'
s so much faster than his that it really isn' t worth while to follow
me."

Besides perfecting himself in what he tolerantly calls" tricks" of horsemanship
and marksmanship, he studied the signs of the trail, forest and prairie,
as a sailing- master studies the waves and clouds. The knowledge he
gathers from inanimate objects and dumb animals seems little less
than miraculous.

And when you ask him how he knows these things he always gives you
a reason founded on some fact or habit of nature that shows him to be
a naturalist, mineralogist, geologist, and botanist, and not merely
a seventh son of a seventh son.

In South Africa he would say to the officers:" There are a dozen Boers five miles ahead of us riding Basuto
ponies at a trot, and leading five others. If we hurry we should be able to sight them in an hour." At
first the officers would smile, but not after a half- hour' s gallop,
when they would see ahead of them a dozen Boers leading five ponies.
In the early days of Salem, Burnham would have been burned as a witch.

When twenty- three years of age he married Miss Blanche Blick, of Iowa. They
had known each other from childhood, and her brothers- in- law have been Burnham'
s aids and companions in every part of Africa and the West. Neither
at the time of their marriage nor since did Mrs. Burnham" lay a hand
mining prospector.

And in 1893, when Burnham and his brother- in- law, Ingram, started for
South Africa, Mrs. Burnham went with them, and in every part of South
Africa shared her husband' s life of travel and danger. In making
this move across the sea, Burnham' s original idea was to look for gold
in the territory owned by the German East African Company.

But as in Rhodesia the first Matabele uprising had broken out, he continued
on down the coast, and volunteered for that campaign. This was the real beginning
of his fortunes. The" war" was not unlike the Indian fighting of his
early days, and although the country was new to him, with the kind of
warfare then being waged between the Kaffirs under King Lobengula and the white
settlers of the British South Africa Company, the chartered company
of Cecil Rhodes, he was intimately familiar.

It does not take big men long to recognize other big men, and Burnham' s
remarkable work as a scout at once brought him to the notice of Rhodes
and Dr. Jameson, who was personally conducting the campaign. The war was
their own private war, and to them, at such a crisis in the history
of their settlement, a man like Burnham was invaluable.

The chief incident of this campaign, the fame of which rang over
all Great Britain and her colonies, was the gallant but hopeless stand
made by Major Alan Wilson and his patrol of thirty- four men.

It was Burnham' s attempt to save these men that made him known from
Buluwayo to Cape Town. King Lobengula and his warriors were halted on
one bank of the Shangani River, and on the other Major Forbes, with
a picked force of three hundred men, was coming up in pursuit.

Although at the moment he did not know it, he also was being pursued by a force of Matabeles, who were gradually surrounding
him.

At nightfall Major Wilson and a patrol of twelve men, with Burnham and his brother- in- law, Ingram,
acting as scouts, were ordered to make a dash into the camp of Lobengula
and, if possible, in the confusion of their sudden attack, and under
cover of a terrific thunder- storm that was raging, bring him back
a prisoner.

With the king in their hands the white men believed the rebellion would collapse. To the number of
three 1000 the Matabeles were sleeping in a succession Now of camps, through which the fourteen men rode
at a gallop. But in the darkness it was difficult to distinguish the trek wagon of the king, and
by the time they found his laager the Matabeles from the other camps through which they had ridden had given
the alarm. Through the underbrush from every side the enemy, armed
with assegai and elephant guns, charged toward them and spread out
to cut off their retreat.

At a distance of about seven hundred yards from the camps there was
a giant ant- hill, and the patrol rode toward it. By the aid of the
lightning flashes they made their way through a dripping wood and
over soil which the rain had turned into thick black mud.

When the party drew rein at the ant- hill it was found that of the
fourteen three were missing. As the official scout of the patrol and
the only one who could see in the dark, Wilson ordered Burnham back
to find them.

Burnham said he could do so only by feeling hoof- prints in the mud and that he would like some
one with him to lead his pony.

Wilson said he would lead it. With his fingers Burnham followed the trail of
the eleven horses to where, at right angles, the hoof- prints of the three
others separated from it, and so came upon the three men.

Still, with nothing but the and below you. They tell of him that one day, while
out with a patrol on the veldt, he said he had lost the trail and, dismounting,
began moving about on his hands and knees, nosing the ground like a bloodhound,
and pointing out a trail that led back over the way the force had
just marched.

When the commanding officer rode up, deputy- sheriff this educated faculty of not requiring sleep aided
him in many important captures. Sometimes he mud of the jungle to guide him, he brought them back
to their comrades.

It was this feat that established his reputation among British, Boers,
and black men in South Africa. Throughout the night the men of the
patrol lay in the mud holding the reins of their horses.

In the jungle about them, they could hear the enemy splashing through the mud, and the swishing
sound of the branches as they swept back into place. It was still raining.
Just before the dawn there came the sounds of voices and the welcome
clatter of accoutrements.

The men of the patrol, believing the column had joined them, sprang
up rejoicing, but it was only a second patrol, under Captain Borrow,
who had been sent forward with twenty men as re- enforcements.

They had come in time to share in a glorious immortality.

No sooner had these men joined than the Kaffirs began the attack; and the white men at once learned that they
were trapped in a complete circle of the enemy. Hidden by the trees, the Kaffirs fired point-
blank, and in a very little time half of Wilson' s force was killed or wounded. As the horses were
shot down the men used them for breastworks. There was no other shelter.

Wilson called Burnham to him and told him he must try and get through
the lines of the enemy to Forbes." Tell him to come up at once," he said;"
we are nearly finished."

He detailed a trooper named Gooding and Ingram to accompany Burnham." One of you may get through,"
he said. Gooding was but lately out from London, and knew nothing of scouting, so Burnham and
Ingram warned him, whether he saw the reason for it or not, to act exactly
as they did. The three men had barely left the others before the enemy
sprang at them with their spears. In five minutes they were being
fired at from every bush. Then followed a remarkable ride, in which
Burnham called to his aid all he had learned in thirty years of border
warfare. As the enemy rushed after them, the three doubled on their tracks,
rode in triple loops, hid in dongas to breathe their horses; and
to scatter their pursuers, separated, joined again, and again separated.

The enemy followed them to the very bank of the river, where, finding the"
drift" covered with the swollen waters, they were forced to swim. They
reached the other bank only to find Forbes hotly engaged with another
force of the Matabeles."

I have been sent for re- enforcements," Burnham said to Forbes,"
but I believe we are the only survivors of that party."

Forbes himself was too hard pressed to give help to Wilson, and Burnham,
his errand over, took his place in the column, and began firing upon
the new enemy. Six weeks later the bodies of Wilson' s patrol were
found lying in a circle.

     Each of them had been shot many times. A son of Lobengula, who
     witnessed their extermination, and who in Buluwayo had often heard
the Englishmen sing their national anthem, told how the five men who
were the last to die stood up and, swinging their hats defiantly,
sang"

God Save the Queen." The incident will long be recorded in song and story;
and in London was reproduced in two theatres, in each of which the
man who played" Burnham, the American Scout," as he rode off for re-
enforcements, was as loudly cheered by those in the audience as by
those on the stage. Hensman, in his" History of Rhodesia," says:" One
hardly knows which to most admire, the men who went on this dangerous,
through brush swarming with natives, or those who remained behind
battling against overwhelming odds." For his help in this war the Chartered
Company presented Burnham with the campaign medal, a gold watch engraved
with words of appreciation; and at the suggestion of Cecil Rhodes
gave him, Ingram, and the Hon. Maurice Clifford, jointly, a tract
of land of three hundred square acres.

After this campaign Burnham led an expedition of ten white men and
seventy Kaffirs north of the Zambesi River to explore Barotzeland
and other regions to the north of Mashonaland, and to establish the
boundaries of the concession given him, Ingram, and Clifford.

 The
beaver, eager to investigate that semifriendly smell, sets foot in the trap; instinctively
when in danger he dives for the deep water; the ring slips along the pole till at the bottom
and there it jams so that the beaver cannot rise again and is drowned.

In an hour the six traps were set for the beavers; presently the hunters, skirmishing for more
partridges, had much trouble to save Skookum from another porcupine disaster.

They got some more grouse, baited the traps for a couple of miles, then camped for the night.

Before morning it came on to snow and it was three inches deep when they arose. There is no
place on earth where the first snow is more beautiful than in the Adirondacks. In early autumn
nature seems to prepare for it. Green leaves are cleared away to expose the berry bunches in
red; rushbeds mass their groups, turn golden brown and bow their heads to meet the silver load;
the low hills and the lines of various Christmas trees are arrayed for the finest effect: the
setting is perfect and the scene, but it lacks the lime light yet. It needs must have the lavish
blaze of white. And when it comes like the veil on a bride, the silver mountings on a charger's
trappings, or the golden fire in a sunset, the shining crystal robe is the finishing, the crowning
glory, without which all the rest must fail, could have no bright completeness. Its beauty
stirred the hunters though it found no better expression than Rolf's simple words, "Ain't it
fine," while the Indian gazed in silence.

There is no other place in the eastern woods where the snow has such manifold tales to tell,
and the hunters that day tramping found themselves dowered over night with the wonderful power
of the hound to whom each trail is a plain record of every living creature that has passed
within many hours. And though the first day after a storm has less to tell than the second,
just as the second has less than the third, there was no lack of story in the snow. Here sped
some antlered buck, trotting along while yet the white was flying. There went a fox, sneaking
across the line of march, and eying distrustfully that deadfall. This broad trail with many
large tracks not far apart was made by one of Skookum's friends, a knight of many spears. That
bounding along was a marten. See how he quartered that thicket like a hound, here he struck
our odour trail. Mark, how he paused and whiffed it; now away he goes; yes, straight to our trap.

"It's down; hurrah!" Rolf shouted, for there, dead under the log, was an exquisite marten,
dark, almost black, with a great, broad, shining breast of gold.

They were going back now toward the beaver lake. The next trap was sprung and empty; the next
held the body of a red squirrel, a nuisance always and good only to rebait the trap he springs.
But the next held a marten, and the next a white weasel. Others were unsprung, but they had
two good pelts when they reached the beaver lake. They were in high spirits with their good
luck, but not prepared for the marvellous haul that now was theirs. Each of the six traps held
a big beaver, dead, drowned, and safe. Each skin was worth five dollars, and the hunters felt
rich. The incident had, moreover, this pleasing significance: It showed that these beavers
were unsophisticated, so had not been hunted. Fifty pelts might easily be taken from these ponds.

The trappers reset the traps; then dividing the load, sought a remote place to camp, for it
does not do to light a fire near your beaver pond. One hundred and fifty pounds of beaver,
in addition, to their packs, was not a load to be taken miles away; within half a mile on a
lower level they selected a warm place, made a fire, and skinned their catch. The bodies they
opened and hung in a tree with a view to future use, but the pelts and tails they carried on.

They made a long, hard tramp that day, baiting all the traps and reached home late in the night.

Chapter 32. The Antler-bound Bucks

IN THE man-world, November is the month of gloom, despair, and many suicides. In the wild world,
November is the Mad Moon. Many and diverse the madnesses of the time, but none more insane
than the rut of the white-tailed deer. Like some disease it appears, first in the swollen necks
of the antler-bearers, and then in the feverish habits of all. Long and obstinate combats between
the bucks now, characterize the time; neglecting even to eat, they spend their days and nights
in rushing about and seeking to kill.

Their horns, growing steadily since spring, are now of full size, sharp, heavy, and cleaned
of the velvet; in perfection. For what? Has Nature made them to pierce, wound, and destroy?
Strange as it may seem, these weapons of offence are used for little but defence; less as spears
than as bucklers they serve the deer in battles with its kind. And the long, hard combats are
little more than wrestling and pushing bouts; almost never do they end fatally. When a mortal
thrust is given, it is rarely a gaping wound, but a sudden springing and locking of the antlers,
whereby the two deer are bound together, inextricably, hopelessly, and so suffer death by starvation.
The records of deer killed by their rivals and left on the duel-ground are few; very few and
far between. The records of those killed by interlocking are numbered by the scores.

There were hundreds of deer in this country that Rolf and Quonab claimed. Half of them were
bucks, and at least half of these engaged in combat some times or many times a day, all through
November; that is to say, probably a thousand duels were fought that month within ten miles
of the cabin. It was not surprising that Rolf should witness some of them, and hear many more
in the distance.

They were living in the cabin now, and during the still, frosty nights, when he took a last
look at the stars, before turning in, Rolf formed the habit of listening intently for the voices
of the gloom. Sometimes it was the "hoo-hoo" of the horned-owl, once or twice it was the long,
smooth howl of the wolf; but many times it was the rattle of antlers that told of two bucks
far up in the hardwoods, trying out the all-important question, "Which is the better buck?"

One morning he heard still an occasional rattle at the same place as the night before. He set
out alone, after breakfast, and coming cautiously near, peered into a little, open space to
see two bucks with heads joined, slowly, feebly pushing this way and that. Their tongues were
out; they seemed almost exhausted, and the trampled snow for an acre about plainly showed that
they had been fighting for hours; that indeed these were the ones he had heard in the night.
Still they were evenly matched, and the green light in their eyes told of the ferocious spirit
in each of these gentle-looking deer.

Rolf had no difficulty in walking quite near. If they saw him, they gave slight heed to the
testimony of their eyes, for the unenergetic struggle went on until, again pausing for breath,
they separated, raised their heads a little, sniffed, then trotted away from the dreaded enemy
so near. Fifty yards off, they turned, shook their horns, seemed in doubt whether to run away,
join battle again, or attack the man. Fortunately the first was their choice, and Rolf returned
to the cabin.

Quonab listened to his account, then said: "You might have been killed. Every buck is crazy
now. Often they attack man. My father's brother was killed by a Mad Moon buck. They found only
his body, torn to rags. He had got a little way up a tree, but the buck had pinned him. There
were the marks, and in the snow they could see how he held on to the deer's horns and was dragged
about till his strength gave out. He had no gun. The buck went off. That was all they knew.
I would rather trust a bear than a deer."

The Indian's words were few, but they drew a picture all too realistic. The next time Rolf
heard the far sound of a deer fight, it brought back the horror of that hopeless fight in the
snow, and gave him a new and different feeling for the antler-bearer of the changing mood.

It was two weeks after this, when he was coming in from a trip alone on part of the line, when
his ear caught some strange sounds in the woods ahead; deep, sonorous, semi-human they were.
Strange and weird wood-notes in winter are nearly sure to be those of a raven or a jay; if
deep, they are likely to come from a raven.

"Quok, quok, ha, ha, ha-hreww, hrrr, hooop, hooop," the diabolic noises came, and Rolf, coming
gently forward, caught a glimpse of sable pinions swooping through the lower pines.

"Ho, ho, ho yah--hew--w--w--w" came the demon laughter of the death birds, and Rolf soon glimpsed
a dozen of them in the branches, hopping or sometimes flying to the ground. One alighted on
a brown bump. Then the bump began to move a little. The raven was pecking away, but again the
brown bump heaved and the raven leaped to a near perch. "Wah--wah--wah--wo--hoo--yow--wow--rrrrrr-rrrr-rrrr"--and
the other ravens joined in.

Rolf had no weapons but his bow, his pocket knife, and a hatchet. He took the latter in his
hand and walked gently forward; the hollow-voiced ravens "haw--hawed," then flew to safe perches
where they chuckled like ghouls over some extra-ghoulish joke.

The lad, coming closer, witnessed a scene that stirred him with mingled horror and pity. A
great, strong buck--once strong, at least--was standing, staggering, kneeling there; sometimes
on his hind legs, spasmodically heaving and tugging at a long gray form on the ground, the
body of another buck, his rival, dead now, with a broken neck, as it proved, but bearing big,
strong antlers with which the antlers of the living buck were interlocked as though riveted
with iron, bolted with clamps of steel. With all his strength, the living buck could barely
move his head, dragging his adversary's body with him. The snow marks showed that at first
he had been able to haul the carcass many yards; had nibbled a little at shoots and twigs;
but that was when he was stronger, was long before. How long? For days, at least, perhaps a
week, that wretched buck was dying hopelessly a death that would not come. His gaunt sides,
his parched and lolling tongue, less than a foot from the snow and yet beyond reach, the filmy
eye, whose opaque veil of death was illumined again with a faint fire of fighting green as
the new foe came. The ravens had picked the eyes out of the dead buck and eaten a hole in its
back. They had even begun on the living buck, but he had been able to use one front foot to
defend his eyes; still his plight could scarce have been more dreadful. It made the most pitiful
spectacle Rolf had ever seen in wild life; yes, in all his life. He was full of compassion
for the poor brute. He forgot it as a thing to be hunted for food; thought of it only as a
harmless, beautiful creature in dire and horrible straits; a fellow-being in distress; and
he at once set about being its helper. With hatchet in hand he came gently in front, and selecting
an exposed part at the base of the dead buck's antler he gave a sharp blow with the hatchet.
The effect on the living buck was surprising. He was roused to vigorous action that showed
him far from death as yet. He plunged, then pulled backward, carrying with him the carcass
and the would-be rescuer. Then Rolf remembered the Indian's words: "You can make strong medicine
with your mouth." He spoke to the deer, gently, softly. Then came nearer, and tapped o'n the
horn he wished to cut; softly speaking and tapping he increased his force, until at last he
was permitted to chop seriously at that prison bar. It took many blows, for the antler stuff
is very thick and strong at this time, but the horn was loose at last. Rolf gave it a twist
and the strong buck was free. Free for what?

Oh, tell it not among the folk who have been the wild deer's friend! Hide it from all who blindly
believe that gratitude must always follow good-will! With unexpected energy, with pent-up fury,
with hellish purpose, the ingrate sprang on his deliverer, aiming a blow as deadly as was in
his power.

Wholly taken by surprise, Rolf barely had time to seize the murderer's horns and ward them
off his vitals. The buck made a furious lunge. Oh! what foul fiend was it gave him then such
force?--and Rolf went down. Clinging for dear life to those wicked, shameful horns, he yelled
as he never yelled before: "Quonab, Quonabi help me, oh, help me!" But he was pinned at once,
the fierce brute above him pressing on his chest, striving to bring its horns to bear; his
only salvation had been that their wide spread gave his body room between. But the weight on
his chest was crushing out his force, his life; he had no breath to call again. How the ravens
chuckled, and "haw-hawed" in the tree!

The buck's eyes gleamed again with the emerald light of murderous hate, and he jerked his strong
neck this way and that with the power of madness. It could not last for long. The boy's strength
was going fast; the beast was crushing in his chest.

"Oh, God, help me!" he gasped, as the antlered fiend began again struggling for the freedom
of those murderous horns. The brute was almost free, when the ravens rose with loud croaks,
and out of the woods dashed another to join the fight. A smaller deer? No; what? Rolf knew
not, nor how, but in a moment there was a savage growl and Skookum had the murderer by the
hind leg. Worrying and tearing he had not the strength to throw the deer, but his teeth were
sharp, his heart was in his work, and when he transferred his fierce attack to parts more tender
still, the buck, already spent, reared, wheeled, and fell. Before he could recover Skookum
pounced upon him by the nose and hung on like a vice. The buck could swing his great neck a
little, and drag the dog, but he could not shake him off. Rolf saw the chance, rose to his
tottering legs, seized his hatchet, stunned the fierce brute with a blow. Then finding on the
snow his missing knife he gave the hunter stroke that spilled the red life-blood and sank on
the ground to know no more till Quonab stood beside him.

Chapter 33. A Song of Praise

ROLF was lying by a fire when he came to, Quonab bending over him with a look of grave concern.
When he opened his eyes, the Indian smiled; such a soft, sweet smile, with long, ivory rows
in its background.

Then he brought hot tea, and Rolf revived so he could sit up and tell the story of the morning.

"He is an evil Manito," and he looked toward the dead buck; "we must not eat him. You surely
made medicine to bring Skookum."

"Yes, I made medicine with my mouth," was the answer, "I called, I yelled, when he came at me."

"It is a long way from here to the cabin," was Quonab's reply. "I could not hear you; Skookum
could not hear you; but Cos Cob, my father, told me that when you send out a cry for help,
you send medicine, too, that goes farther than the cry. May be so; I do not know: my father
was very wise."

"Did you see Skookum come, Quonab?"

"No; he was with me hours after you left, but he was restless and whimpered. Then he left me
and it was a long time before I heard him bark. It was the 'something-wrong' bark. I went.
He brought me here."

"He must have followed my track all 'round the line."

After an hour they set out for the cabin. The ravens "Ha-ha-ed" and "Ho-ho-ed" as they went.
Quonab took the fateful horn that Rolf had chopped off, and hung it on a sapling with a piece
of tobacco and a red yam streamer ', to appease the evil spirit that surely was near. There
it hung for years after, until the sapling grew to a tree that swallowed the horn, all but
the tip, which rotted away.

Skookum took a final sniff at his fallen enemy, gave the body the customary expression of a
dog's contempt, then led the procession homeward.

Not that day, not the next, but on the first day of calm, red, sunset sky, went Quonab to his
hill of worship; and when the little fire that he lit sent up its thread of smoke, like a plumb-line
from the red cloud over him, he burnt a pinch of tobacco, and, with face and arms upraised
in the red light, he sang a new song:

     "The evil one set a trap for my son,
     But the Manito saved him;
     In the form of a Skookum he saved him."

Chapter 34. The Birch-bark Vessels

Rolf was sore and stiff for a week afterward; so was Skookum. There were times when Quonab
was cold, moody, and silent for days. Then some milder wind would blow in the region of his
heart and the bleak ice surface melted into running rills of memory or kindly emanation.

Just before the buck adventure, there had been an unpleasant time of chill and aloofness. It
arose over little. Since the frost had come, sealing the waters outside, Quonab would wash
his hands in the vessel that was also the bread pan. Rolf had New England ideas of propriety
in cooking matters, and finally he forgot the respect due to age and experience. That was one
reason why he went out alone that day. Now, with time to think things over, the obvious safeguard
would be to have a wash bowl; but where to get it? In those days, tins were scarce and ex-pensive.
It was the custom to look in the woods for nearly all the necessaries of life; and, guided
by ancient custom and experience, they seldom looked in vain. Rolf had seen, and indeed made,
watering troughs, pig troughs, sap troughs, hen troughs, etc., all his life, and he now set
to work with the axe and a block of basswood to hew out a trough for a wash bowl. With adequate
tools he might have made a good one; but, working with an axe and a stiff arm, the result was
a very heavy, crude affair. It would indeed hold water, but it was almost impossible to dip
it into the water hole, so that a dipper was needed.

When Quonab saw the plan and the result, he said: "In my father's lodge we had only birch bark.
See; I shall make a bowl." He took from the storehouse a big roll of birch bark, gathered in
warm weather (it can scarcely be done in cold), for use in repairing the canoe. Selecting a
good part he cut out a square, two feet each way, and put it in the big pot which was full
of boiling water. At the same time he soaked with it a bundle of wattap, or long fibrous roots
of the white spruce, also gathered before the frost came, with a view to canoe repairs in the
spring.

While these were softening in the hot water, he cut a couple of long splints of birch, as nearly
as possible half an inch wide and an eighth of an inch thick, and put them to steep with the
bark. Next he made two or three straddle pins or clamps, like clothes pegs, by splitting the
ends of some sticks which had a knot at one end.

Now he took out the spruce roots, soft and pliant, and selecting a lot that were about an eighth
of an inch in diameter, scraped off the bark and roughness, until he had a bundle of perhaps
ten feet of soft, even, white cords.

The bark was laid flat and cut as below.

The rounding of A and B is necessary, for the holes of the sewing would tear the piece off
if all were on the same line of grain. Each corner was now folded and doubled on itself (C),
then held so with a straddle pin (D). The rim was trimmed so as to be flat where it crossed
the fibre of the bark, and arched where it ran along. The pliant rods of birch were bent around
this, and using the large awl to make holes, Quonab sewed the rim rods to the bark with an
over-lapping stitch that made a smooth finish to the edge, and the birch-bark wash pan was
complete. (E.) Much heavier bark can be used if the plan F G be followed, but it is hard to
make it water-tight.

So now they had a wash pan and a cause of friction was removed. Rolf found it amusing as well
as useful to make other bark vessels of varying sizes for dippers and dunnage. It was work
that he could do now while he was resting and recovering and he became expert. After watching
a fairly successful attempt at a box to hold fish-hooks and tackle, Quonab said: "In my father's
lodge these would bear quill work in colours."

"That's so," said Rolf, remembering the birch-bark goods often sold by the Indians. "I wish
we had a porcupine now."

"Maybe Skookum could find one," said the Indian, with a smile.

"Will you let me kill the next Kahk we find?"

"Yes, if you use the quills and burn its whiskers."

"Why burn its whiskers?"

"My father said it must be so. The smoke goes straight to the All-above; then the Manito knows
we have killed, but we have remembered to kill only for use and to thank Him."

It was some days before they found a porcupine, and when they did, it was not necessary for
them to kill it. But that belongs to another chapter.

They saved its skin with all its spears and hung it in the storehouse. The quills with the
white bodies and ready-made needle at each end are admirable for embroidering, but they are
white only.

"How can we dye them, Quonab?

"In the summer are many dyes; in winter they are hard to get. We can get some."

So forth he went to a hemlock tree, and cut till he could gather the inner pink bark, which,
boiled with the quills, turned them a dull pink; similarly, alder bark furnished rich orange,
and butternut bark a brown. Oak chips, with a few bits of iron in the pot, dyed black.

"Must wait till summer for red and green," said the Indian. "Red comes only from berries; the
best is the blitum. We call it squaw-berry and mis-caw-wa, yellow comes from the yellow root
(Hydrastis)."

But black, white, orange, pink, brown, and a dull red made by a double dip of orange and pink,
are a good range of colour. The method in using the quills is simple. An awl to make holes
in the bark for each; the rough parts behind are concealed afterward with a lining of bark
stitched over them; and before the winter was over, Rolf had made a birch-bark box, decorated
lid and all, with porcupine quill work, in which he kept the sable skin that was meant to buy
Annette's new dress, the costume she had dreamed of, the ideal and splendid, almost unbelievable
vision of her young life, ninety-five cents' worth of cotton print.

There was one other point of dangerous friction. Whenever it fell to Quonab to wash the dishes,
he simply set them on the ground and let Skookum lick them off. This economical arrangement
was satisfactory to Quonab, delightful to Skookum, and apparently justified by the finished
product, but Rolf objected. The Indian said: "Don't he eat the same food as we do? You cannot
tell if you do not see."

Whenever he could do so, Rolf washed the doubtful dishes over again, yet there were many times
when this was impossible, and the situation became very irritating. But he knew that the man
who loses his temper has lost the first round of the fight, so, finding the general idea of
uncleanness without avail, he sought for some purely Indian argument. As they sat by the evening
fire, one day, he led up to talk of his mother--of her power as a medicine woman, of the many
evil medicines that harmed her. "It was evil medicine for her if a dog licked her hand or touched
her food. A dog licked her hand and the dream dog came to her three days before she died."
After a long pause, he added, "In some ways I am like my mother."

Two days later, Rolf chanced to see his friend behind the shanty give Skookum the pan to clean
off after they had been frying deer fat. The Indian had no idea that Rolf was near, nor did
he ever learn the truth of it.

That night, after midnight, the lad rose quietly, lighted the pine splints that served them
for a torch, rubbed some charcoal around each eye to make dark rings that should supply a horror-stricken
look. Then he started in to pound on Quonab's tom-tom, singing:

     "Evil spirit leave me;
     Dog-face do not harm me."

Quonab sat up in amazement. Rolf paid no heed, but went on, bawling and drumming and staring
upward into vacant space. After a few minutes Skookum scratched and whined at the shanty door.
Rolf rose, took his knife, cut a bunch of hair from Skookum's neck and burned it in the torch,
then went on singing with horrid solemnity:

     "Evil spirit leave me;
     Dog-face do not harm me."

At last he turned, and seeming to discover that Quonab was looking on, said:

"The dream dog came to me. I thought I saw him lick deer grease from the frying pan behind
the shanty. He laughed, for he knew that he made evil medicine for me. I am trying to drive
him away, so he cannot harm me. I do not know. I am like my mother. She was very wise, but
she died after it."

Now Quonab arose, cut some more hair from Skookum, added a pinch of tobacco, then, setting
it ablaze, he sang in the rank odour of the burning weed and hair, his strongest song to kill
ill magic; and Rolf, as he chuckled and sweetly sank to sleep, knew that the fight was won.
His friend would never, never more install Skookum in the high and sacred post of pot-licker,
dishwasher, or final polisher.

Chapter 35. Snaring Rabbits

The deepening snow about the cabin was marked in all the thickets by the multitudinous tracks
of the snowshoe rabbits or white hares. Occasionally the hunters saw them, but paid little
heed. Why should they look at rabbits when deer were plentiful?

"You catch rabbit?" asked Quonab one day when Rolf was feeling fit again.

"I can shoot one with my bow," was the answer, "but why should I, when we have plenty of deer?"

"My people always hunted rabbits. Sometimes no deer were to be found; then the rabbits were
food. Sometimes in the enemy's country it was not safe to hunt, except rabbits, with blunt
arrows, and they were food. Sometimes only squaws and children in camp--nothing to eat; no
guns; then the rabbits were food."

"Well, see me get one," and Rolf took his bow and arrow. He found many white bunnies, but always
in the thickest woods. Again and again he tried, but the tantalizing twigs and branches muffled
the bow and turned the arrow. It was hours before he returned with a fluffy snowshoe rabbit.

"That is not our way." Quonab led to the thicket and selecting a place of many tracks he cut
a lot of brush and made a hedge across with half a dozen openings. At each of these openings
he made a snare of strong cord tied to a long pole, hung on a crotch, and so arranged that
a tug at the snare would free the pole which in turn would hoist the snare and the creature
in it high in the air.

Next morning they went around and found that four of the snares had each a snow-white rabbit
hanging by the neck. As he was handling these, Quonab felt a lump I on the hind leg of one.
He carefully cut it open and turned out a curious-looking object about the size of an acorn,
flattened, made of flesh and covered with hair, and nearly the shape of a large bean. He gazed
at it, and, turning to Rolf, said with intense meaning:

"Ugh! we have found the good hunting. This is the Peeto-wab-oos-once, the little medicine rabbit.
Now we have strong medicine in the lodge. You shall see."

He went out to the two remaining snares and passed the medicine rabbit through each. An hour
later, when they returned, they found a rabbit taken in the first snare.

"It is ever so," said the Indian. "We can always catch rabbits now. My father had the Peeto-wab-i-ush
once, the little medicine deer, and so he never failed in hunting but twice. Then he found
that his papoose, Quonab, had stolen his great medicine. He was a very wise papoose. He killed
a chipmunk each of those days."

"Hark! what is that?" A faint sound of rustling branches, and some short animal noises in the
woods had caught Rolf's ear, and Skookum's, too, for he was off like one whose life is bound
up in a great purpose.

"Yap, yap, yap," came the angry sound from Skookum. Who can say that animals have no language?
His merry "yip, yip, yip," for partridge up a tree, or his long, hilarious, "Yow, yow, yow,"
when despite all orders he chased some deer, were totally distinct from the angry "Yap, yap,"
he gave for the bear up the tree, or the "Grrryapgrryap," with which he voiced his hatred of
the porcupine.

But now it was the "Yap, yap," as when he had treed the bears.

"Something up a tree," was the Indian's interpretation, as they followed the sound. Something
up a tree! A whole menagerie it seemed to Rolf when they got there. Hanging by the neck in
the remaining snare, and limp now, was a young lynx, a kit of the year. In the adjoining tree,
with Skookum circling and yapping 'round the base, was a savage old lynx. In the crotch above
her was another young one, and still higher was a third, all looking their unutterable disgust
at the noisy dog below; the mother, indeed, expressing it in occasional hisses, but none of
them daring to come down and face him. The lynx is very good fur and very easy prey. The Indian
brought the old one down with a shot; then, as fast as he could reload, the others were added
to the bag, and, with the one from the snare, they returned laden to the cabin.

The Indian's eyes shone with a peculiar light. "Ugh! Ugh! My father told me; it is great medicine.
You see, now, it does not fail."

Chapter 36. Something Wrong at the Beaver Traps

Once they had run the trap lines, and their store of furs was increasing finely. They had taken
twenty-five beavers and counted on getting two or three each time they went to the ponds. But
they got an unpleasant surprise in December, on going to the beaver grounds, to find all the
traps empty and unmistakable signs that some man had been there and had gone off with the catch.
They followed the dim trail of his snowshoes, half hidden by a recent wind, but night came
on with more snow, and all signs were lost.

The thief had not found the line yet, for the haul of marten and mink was good. But this was
merely the beginning.

The trapper law of the wilderness is much like all primitive laws; first come has first right,
provided he is able to hold it. If a strong rival comes in, the first must fight as best he
can. The law justifies him in anything he may do, if he succeeds. The law justifies the second
in anything he may do, except murder. That is, the defender may shoot to kill; the offender
may not.

But the fact of Quonab's being an Indian and Rolf supposedly one, would turn opinion against
them in the Adirondacks, and it was quite likely that the rival considered them trespassers
on his grounds, although the fact that he robbed their traps without removing them, and kept
out of sight, rather showed the guilty conscience of a self-accused poacher.

He came in from the west, obviously; probably the Racquet River country; was a large man, judging
by his foot and stride, and understood trapping; but lazy, for he set no traps. His principal
object seemed to be to steal.

And it was not long before he found their line of marten traps, so his depredations increased.
Primitive emotions are near the surface at all times, and under primitive conditions are very
ready to appear. Rolf and Quonab felt that now it was war.

Chapter 37. The Pekan or Fisher

There was one large track in the snow that they saw several times--it was like that of a marten,
but much larger. "Pekan," said the Indian, "the big marten; the very strong one, that fights
without fear."

"When my father was a papoose he shot an arrow at a pekan. He did not know what it was; it
seemed only a big black marten. It was wounded, but sprang from the tree on my father's breast.
It would have killed him, but for the dog; then it would have killed the dog, but my grandfather
was near.

"He made my father eat the pekan's heart, so his heart might be like it. It sought no fight,
but it turned, when struck, and fought without fear. That is the right way; seek peace, but
fight without fear. That was my father's heart and mine." Then glancing toward the west he
continued in a tone of menace: "That trap robber will find it so. We sought no fight, but some
day I kill him."

The big track went in bounds, to be lost in a low, thick woods. But they met it again.

They were crossing a hemlock ridge a mile farther on, when they came to another track which
was first a long, deep furrow, some fifteen inches wide, and in this were the wide-spread prints
of feet as large as those of a fisher.

"Kahk," said Quonab, and Skookum said "Kahk," too, but he did it by growling and raising his
back hair, and doubtless also by sadly remembering. His discretion seemed as yet embryonic,
so Rolf slipped his sash through the dog's collar, and they followed the track, for the porcupine
now stood in Rolf's mind as a sort of embroidery outfit.

They had not followed far before another track joined on--the track of the fisher-pekan; and
soon after they heard in the woods ahead scratching sounds, as of something climbing, and once
or twice a faint, far, fighting snarl.

Quickly tying the over-valiant Skookum to a tree, they crept forward, ready for anything, and
arrived on the scene of a very peculiar action.

Action it was, though it was singularly devoid of action. First, there was a creature, like
a huge black marten or a short-legged black fox, standing at a safe distance, while, partly
hidden under a log, with hind quarters and tail only exposed, was a large porcupine. Both were
very still, but soon the fisher snarled and made a forward lunge. The porcupine, hearing the
sounds or feeling the snow dash up on that side, struck with its tail; but the fisher kept
out of reach. Next a feint was made on the other side, with the same result; then many, as
though the fisher were trying to tire out the tail or use up all its quills.

Sometimes the assailant leaped on the log and teased the quill-pig to strike upward, while
many white daggers already sunk in the bark showed that these tactics had been going on for
some time.

Now the two spectators saw by the trail that a similar battle had been fought at another log,
and that the porcupine trail from that was spotted with blood. How the fisher had forced it
out was not then clear, but soon became so.

After feinting till the Kahk would not strike, the pekan began a new manceuvre. Starting on
the opposite side of the log that protected the spiny one's nose, he burrowed quickly through
the snow and leaves. The log was about three inches from the ground, and before the porcupine
could realize it, the fisher had a space cleared and seized the spiny one by its soft, unspiny
nose. Grunting and squealing it pulled back and lashed its terrible tail. To what effect? Merely
to fill the log around with quills. With all its strength the quill-pig pulled and writhed,
but the fisher was stronger. His claws enlarged the hole and when the victim ceased from exhaustion,
the fisher made a forward dash and changed his hold from the tender nose to the still more
tender throat of the porcupine. His hold was not deep enough and square enough to seize the
windpipe, but he held on. For a minute or two the struggles of Kahk were of desperate energy
and its lashing tail began to be short of spines, but a red stream trickling from the wound
was sapping its strength. Protected by the log, the fisher had but to hold on and play a waiting
game.

The heaving and backward pulling of Kahk were very feeble at length; the fisher had nearly
finished the fight. But he was impatient of further delay and backing out of the hole he mounted
the log, displaying a much scratched nose; then reaching down with deft paw, near the quill-pig's
shoulder, he gave a sudden jerk that threw the former over on its back, and before it could
recover, the fisher's jaws closed on its ribs, and crushed and tore. The nerveless, almost
quilless tail could not harm him there. The red blood flowed and the porcupine lay still. Again
and again as he uttered chesty growls the pekan ground his teeth into the warm flesh and shook
and worried the unconquerable one he had conquered. He was licking his bloody chops for the
twentieth time, gloating in gore, when "crack" went Quonab's gun, and the pekan had an opportunity
of resuming the combat with Kahk far away in the Happy Hunting.

"Yap, yap, yap!" and in rushed Skookum, dragging the end of Rolf's sash which he had gnawed
through in his determination to be in the fight, no matter what it cost; and it was entirely
due to the fact that the porcupine was belly up, that Skookum did not have another hospital
experience.

This was Rolf's first sight of a fisher, and he examined it as one does any animal--or man--that
one has so long heard described in superlative terms that it has become idealized into a semi-myth.
This was the desperado of the woods; the weird black cat that feared no living thing. This
was the only one that could fight and win against Kahk.

They made a fire at once, and while Rolf got the mid-day meal of tea and venison, Quonab skinned
the fisher. Then he cut out its heart and liver. When these were cooked he gave the first to
Rolf and the second to Skookum, saying to the one, "I give you a pekan heart;" and to the dog,
"That will force all of the quills out of you if you play the fool again, as I think you will."

In the skin of the fisher's neck and tail they found several quills, some of them new, some
of them dating evidently from another fight of the same kind, but none of them had done any
damage. There was no inflammation or sign of poisoning. "It is ever so," said Quonab, "the
quills cannot hurt him." Then, turning to the porcupine, he remarked, as he prepared to skin it:

"Ho, Kahk! you see now it was a big mistake you did not let Nana Bojou sit on the dry end of
that log."

Chapter 38. The Silver Fox

They were returning to the cabin, one day, when Quonab stopped and pointed. Away off on the
snow of the far shore was a moving shape to be seen.

"Fox, and I think silver fox; he so black. I think he lives there."

"Why?" "I have seen many times a very big fox track, and they do not go where they do not live.
Even in winter they keep their own range."

"He's worth ten martens, they say?" queried Rolf.

"Ugh! fifty."

"Can't we get him?"

"Can try. But the water set will not work in winter; we must try different."

This was the plan, the best that Quonab could devise for the snow: Saving the ashes from the
fire (dry sand would have answered), he selected six open places in the woods on the south
of the lake, and in each made an ash bed on which he scattered three or four drops of the smell-charm.
Then, twenty-five yards from each, on the north or west side (the side of the prevailing wind)
he hung from some sapling a few feathers, a partridge wing or tail with some red yarns to it.
He left the places unvisited for two weeks, then returned to learn the progress of act one.

Judging from past experience of fox nature and from the few signs that were offered by the
snow, this is what had happened: A fox came along soon after the trappers left, followed the
track a little way, came to the first opening, smelled the seductive danger-lure, swung around
it, saw the dangling feathers, took alarm, and went off. Another of the places had been visited
by a marten. He had actually scratched in the ashes. A wolf had gone around another at a safe
distance.

Another had been shunned several times by a fox or by foxes, but they had come again and again
and at last yielded to the temptation to investigate the danger-smell; finally had rolled in
it, evidently wallowing in an abandon of delight. So far, the plan was working there.

The next move was to set the six strong fox traps, each thoroughly smoked, and chained to a
fifteen-pound block of wood.

Approaching the place carefully and using his blood-rubbed glove, Quonab set in each ash pile
a trap. Under its face he put a wad of white rabbit fur. Next he buried all in the ashes, scattered
a few bits of rabbit and a few drops of smell-charm, then dashed snow over the place, renewed
the dangling feathers to lure the eye; and finally left the rest to the weather.

Rolf was keen to go the next day, but the old man said: "Wah! no good! no trap go first night;
man smell too strong." The second day there was a snowfall, and the third morning Quonab said,
"Now seem like good time."

The first trap was untouched, but there was clearly the track of a large fox within ten yards
of it.

The second was gone. Quonab said, with surprise in his voice, "Deer!" Yes, truly, there was
the record. A deer--a big one--had come wandering past; his keen nose soon apprised him of
a strong, queer appeal near by. He had gone unsuspiciously toward it, sniffed and pawed the
unaccountable and exciting nose medicine; then "snap!" and he had sprung a dozen feet, with
that diabolic smell-thing hanging to his foot. Hop, hop, hop, the terrified deer had gone into
a slashing windfall. Then the drag had caught on the logs, and, thanks to the hard and taper
hoofs, the trap had slipped off and been left behind, while the deer had sought safer regions.

In the next trap they found a beautiful marten dead, killed at once by the clutch of steel.
The last trap was gone, but the tracks and the marks told a tale that any one could read; a
fox had been beguiled and had gone off, dragging the trap and log. Not far did they need to
go; held in a thicket they found him, and Rolf prepared the mid-day meal while Quonab gathered
the pelt. After removing the skin the Indian cut deep and carefully into the body of the fox
and removed the bladder. Its contents sprinkled near each of the traps was good medicine, he
said; a view that was evidently shared by Skookum.

More than once they saw the track of the big fox of the region, but never very near the snare.
He was too clever to be fooled by smell-spells or kidney products, no matter how temptingly
arrayed. The trappers did, indeed, capture three red foxes; but it was at cost of great labour.
It was a venture that did not pay. The silver fox was there, but he took too good care of his
precious hide. The slightest hint of a man being near was enough to treble his already double
wariness. They would never have seen him near at hand, but for a stirring episode that told
a tale of winter hardship.

Chapter 39. The Humiliation of Skookum

If Skookum could have been interviewed by a newspaper man, he would doubtless have said: "I
am a very remarkable dog. I can tree partridges. I'm death on porcupines. I am pretty good
in a dog fight; never was licked in fact: but my really marvellous gift is my speed; I'm a
terror to run."

Yes, he was very proud of his legs, and the foxes that came about in the winter nights gave
him many opportunities of showing what he could do. Many times over he very nearly caught a
fox. Skookum did not know that these wily ones were playing with him; but they were, and enjoyed
it immensely.

The self-sufficient cur never found this out, and never lost a chance of nearly catching a
fox. The men did not see those autumn chases because they were by night; but foxes hunt much
by day in winter, perforce, and are often seen; and more than once they witnessed one of these
farcical races.

And now the shining white furnished background for a much more important affair.

It was near sundown one day when a faint fox bark was heard out on the snow-covered ice of
the lake.

"That's for me," Skookum seemed to think, and jumping up, with a very fierce growl, he trotted
forth; the men looked first from the window. Out on the snow, sitting on his haunches, was
their friend, the big, black silver fox.

Quonab reached for his gun and Rolf tried to call Skookum, but it was too late. He was out
to catch that fox; their business was to look on and applaud. The fox sat on his haunches,
grinning apparently, until Skookum dashed through the snow within twenty yards. Then, that
shining, black fox loped gently away, his huge tail level out behind him, and Skookum, sure
of success, raced up, within six or seven yards. A few more leaps now, and the victory would
be won. But somehow he could not close that six or seven yard gap. No matter how he strained
and leaped, the great black brush was just so far ahead. At first they had headed for the shore,
but the fox wheeled back to the ice and up and down. Skookum felt it was because escape was
hopeless, and he redoubled his effort. But all in vain. He was only wearing himself out, panting
noisily now. The snow was deep enough to be a great disadvantage, more to dog than to fox,
since weight counted as such a handicap. Unconsciously Skookum slowed up. The fox increased
his headway; then audaciously turned around and sat down in the snow.

This was too much for the dog. He wasted about a lungful of air in an angry bark, and again
went after the enemy. Again the chase was round and round, but very soon the dog was so wearied
that he sat down, and now the black fox actually came back and barked at him.

It was maddening. Skookum's pride was touched.

He was in to win or break. His supreme effort brought him within five feet of that white-tipped
brush. Then, strange to tell, the big black fox put forth his large reserve of speed, and making
for the woods, left Skookum far behind. Why? The cause was clear. Quonab, after vainly watching
for a chance to shoot, that would not endanger the dog, had, under cover, crept around the
lake and now was awaiting in a thicket. But the fox's keen nose had warned him. He knew that
the funny part was over, so ran for the woods and disappeared as a ball tossed up the snow
behind him.

Poor Skookum's tongue was nearly a foot long as he walked meekly ashore. He looked depressed;
his tail was depressed; so were his ears; but there was nothing to show whether he would have
told that reporter that he "wasn't feeling up to his usual, to-day," or "Didn't you see me
get the best of him?"

Chapter 40. The Rarest of Pelts

They saw that silver fox three or four times during the winter, and once found that he had
had the audacity to jump from a high snowdrift onto the storehouse and thence to the cabin
roof, where he had feasted on some white rabbits kept there for deadfall baits. But all attempts
to trap or shoot him were vain, and their acquaintance might have ended as it began, but for
an accident.

It proved a winter of much snow. Heavy snow is the worst misfortune that can befall the wood
folk in fur. It hides their food beyond reach, and it checks their movements so they can neither
travel far in search of provender nor run fast to escape their enemies. Deep snow then means
fetters, starvation, and death. There are two ways of meeting the problem: stilts and snowshoes.
The second is far the better. The caribou, and the moose have stilts; the rabbit, the panther,
and the lynx wear snowshoes. When there are three or four feet of soft snow, the lynx is king
of all small beasts, and little in fear of the large ones. Man on his snowshoes has most wild
four-foots at his mercy.

Skookum, without either means of meeting the trouble was left much alone in the shanty. Apparently,
it was on one of these occasions that the silver fox had driven him nearly frantic by eating
rabbits on the roof above him.

The exasperating robbery of their trap line had gone on irregularly all winter, but the thief
was clever enough or lucky enough to elude them.

They were returning to the cabin after a three days' round, when they saw, far out on the white
expanse of the lake, two animals, alternately running and fighting. "Skookum and the fox,"
was the first thought that came, but on entering the cabin Skookum greeted them in person.

Quonab gazed intently at the two running specks and said: "One has no tail. I think it is a
peeshoo (lynx) and a fox."

Rolf was making dinner. From time to time he glanced over the lake and saw the two specks,
usually running. After dinner was over, he said, "Let's sneak 'round and see if we can get a shot."

So, putting on their snowshoes and keeping out of sight, they skimmed over the deer crossing
and through the woods, till at a point near the fighters, and there they saw something that
recalled at once the day of Skookum's humiliation.

A hundred yards away on the open snow was a huge lynx and their old friend, the black and shining
silver fox, face to face; the fox desperate, showing his rows of beautiful teeth, but sinking
belly deep in the snow as he strove to escape. Already he was badly wounded. In any case he
was at the mercy of the lynx who, in spite of his greater weight, had such broad and perfect
snowshoes that he skimmed on the surface, while the fox's small feet sank deep. The lynx was
far from fresh, and still stood in some awe of those rows of teeth that snapped like traps
when he came too near. He was minded, of course, to kill his black rival, but not to be hurt
in doing so. Again and again there was in some sort a closing fight, the wearied fox plunging
breathlessly through the treacherous, relentless snow. If he could only get back to cover,
he might find a corner to protect his rear and have some fighting chance for life. But wherever
he turned that huge cat faced him, doubly armed, and equipped as a fox can never be for the snow.

No one could watch that plucky fight without feeling his sympathies go out to the beautiful
silver fox. Rolf, at least, was for helping him to escape, when the final onset came. In another
dash for the woods the fox plunged out of sight in a drift made soft by sedge sticking through,
and before he could recover, the lynx's jaws closed on the back of his neck and the relentless
claws had pierced his vitals.

The justification of killing is self-preservation, and in this case the proof would have been
the lynx making a meal of the fox. Did he do so? Not at all. He shook his fur, licked his chest
and paws in a self-congratulatory way, then giving a final tug at the body, walked calmly over
the snow along the shore.

Quonab put the back of his hand to his mouth and made a loud squeaking, much like a rabbit
caught in a snare. The lynx stopped, wheeled, and came trotting straight toward the promising
music. Unsuspectingly he came within twenty yards of the trappers. The flint-lock banged and
the lynx was kicking in the snow.

The beautiful silver fox skin was very little injured and proved of value almost to double
their catch so far; while the lynx skin was as good as another marten.

They now had opportunity of studying the tracks and learned that the fox had been hunting rabbits
in a thicket when he was set on by the lynx. At first he had run around in the bushes and saved
himself from serious injury, for the snow was partly packed by the rabbits. After perhaps an
hour of this, he had wearied and sought to save himself by abandoning the lynx's territory,
so had struck across the open lake. But here the snow was too soft to bear him at all, and
the lynx could still skim over. So it proved a fatal error. He was strong and brave. He fought
at least another hour here before the much stronger, heavier lynx had done him to death. There
was no justification. It was a clear case of tyrannical murder, but in this case vengeance
was swift and justice came sooner than its wont.

Chapter 41. The Enemy's Fort

     It pays 'bout once in  a hundred times to git mad, but there
     ain't any  way o' tellin' beforehand which is the time.
     --Sayings of Si Sylvanne.

It generally took two days to run the west line of traps. At a convenient point they had built
a rough shack for a half-way house. On entering this one day, they learned that since their
last visit it had been occupied by some one who chewed tobacco. Neither of them had this habit.
Quonab's face grew darker each time fresh evidence of the enemy was discovered, and the final
wrong was added soon.

Some trappers mark their traps; some do not bother. Rolf had marked all of theirs with a file,
cutting notches on the iron. Two, one, three, was their mark, and it was a wise plan, as it
turned out.

On going around the west beaver pond they found that all six traps had disappeared. In some,
there was no evidence of the thief; in some, the tracks showed clearly that they were taken
by the same interloper that had bothered them all along, and on a jagged branch was a short
blue yarn.

"Now will I take up his trail and kill him," said the Indian.

Rolf had opposed extreme measures, and again he remonstrated. To his surprise, the Indian turned
fiercely and said: "You know it is white man. If he was Indian would you be patient? No!"

"There is plenty of country south of the lake; maybe he was here first."

"You know he was not. You should eat many pekan hearts. I have sought peace, now I fight."

He shouldered his pack, grasped his gun, and his snowshoes went "tssape, tssape, tssape," over
the snow.

Skookum was sitting by Rolf. He rose to resume the march, and trotted a few steps on Quonab's
trail. Rolf did not move; he was dazed by the sudden and painful situation. Mutiny is always
worse than war. Skookum looked back, trotted on, still Rolf sat staring. Quonab's figure was
lost in the distance; the dog's was nearly so. Rolf moved not. All the events of the last year
were rushing through his mind; the refuge he had found with the Indian; the incident of the
buck fight and the tender nurse the red man proved. He wavered. Then he saw Skookum coming
back on the trail. The dog trotted up to the boy and dropped a glove, one of Quonab's. Undoubtedly
the Indian had lost it; Skookum had found it on the trail and mechanically brought it to the
nearest of his masters. Without that glove Quonab's hand would freeze. Rolf rose and sped along
the other's trail. Having taken the step, he found it easy to send a long halloo, then another
and another, till an answer came. In a few minutes Rolf came up. The Indian was sitting on
a log, waiting. The glove was handed over in silence, and received with a grunt.

After a minute or two, Rolf said "Let's get on," and started on the dim trail of the robber.

For an hour or two they strode in silence. Then their course rose as they reached a rocky range.
Among its bare, wind-swept ridges all sign was lost, but the Indian kept on till they were
over and on the other side. A far cast in the thick, windless woods revealed the trail again,
surely the same, for the snowshoe was two fingers wider on every side, and a hand-breadth longer
than Quonab's; besides the right frame had been broken and the binding of rawhide was faintly
seen in the snow mark. It was a mark they had seen all winter, and now it was headed as before
for the west.

When night came down, they camped in a hollow. They were used to snow camps. In the morning
they went on, but wind and snow had hidden their tell-tale guide.

What was the next move? Rolf did not ask, but wondered.

Quonab evidently was puzzled.

At length Rolf ventured: "He surely lives by some river--that way--and within a day's journey.
This track is gone, but we may strike a fresh one. We'll know it when we see it."

The friendly look came back to the Indian's face. "You are Nibowaka."

They had not gone half a mile before they found a fresh track--their old acquaintance. Even
Skookum showed his hostile recognition. And in a few minutes it led them to a shanty. They
slipped off their snowshoes, and hung them in a tree. Quonab opened the door without knocking.
They entered, and in a moment were face to face with a lanky, ill-favoured white man that all
three, including Skookum, recognized as Hoag, the man they had met at the trader's.

That worthy made a quick reach for his rifle, but Quonab covered him and said in tones that
brooked no discussion, "Sit down!"

Hoag did so, sullenly, then growled: "All right; my partners will be here in ten minutes."

Rolf was startled. Quonab and Skookum were not.

"We settled your partners up in the hills," said the former, knowing that one bluff was as
good as another. Skookum growled and sniffed at the enemy's legs. The prisoner made a quick
move with his foot.

"You kick that dog again and it's your last kick," said the Indian.

"Who's kicked yer dog, and what do you mean coming here with yer cutthroat ways? You'll find
there's law in this country before yer through," was the answer.

"That's what we're looking for, you trap robber, you thief. We're here first to find our traps;
second to tell you this: the next time you come on our line there'll be meat for the ravens.
Do you suppose I don't know them?" and the Indian pointed to a large pair of snowshoes with
long heels and a repair lashing on the right frame. "See that blue yarn," and the Indian matched
it with a blue sash hanging to a peg.

"Yes, them belongs to Bill Hawkins; he'll be 'round in five minutes now."

The Indian made a gesture of scorn; then turning to Rolf said: "look 'round for our traps."
Rolf made a thorough search in and about the shanty and the adjoining shed. He found some traps
but none with his mark; none of a familiar make even.

"Better hunt for a squaw and papoose," sneered Hoag, who was utterly puzzled by the fact that
now Rolf was obviously a white lad.

But all the search was vain. Either Hoag had not stolen the traps or had hidden them elsewhere.
The only large traps they found were two of the largest size for taking bear.

Hoag's torrent of bad language had been quickly checked by the threat of turning Skookum loose
on his legs, and he looked such a grovelling beast that presently the visitors decided to leave
him with a warning.

The Indian took the trapper's gun, fired it off out of doors, not in the least perturbed by
the possibility of its being heard by Hoag's partners. He knew they were imaginary. Then changing
his plan, he said "Ugh! You find your gun in half a mile on our trail. But don't come farther
and don't let me see the snowshoe trail on the divide again. Them ravens is awful hungry."

Skookum, to his disappointment, was called off and, talking the trapper's gun for a time, they
left it in a bush and made for their own country.

Chapter 42. Skookum's Panther

"Why are there so few deer tracks now?"

"Deer yarded for winter," replied the Indian; "no travel in deep snow."

"We'll soon need another," said Rolf, which unfortunately was true. They could have killed
many deer in early winter, when the venison was in fine condition, but they had no place to
store it. Now they must get it as they could, and of course it was thinner and poorer every week.

They were on a high hill some days later. There was a clear view and they noticed several ravens
circling and swooping.

"Maybe dead deer; maybe deer yard," said the Indian.

It was over a thick, sheltered, and extensive cedar swamp near the woods where last year they
had seen so many deer, and they were not surprised to find deer tracks in numbers, as soon
as they got into its dense thicket.

A deer yard is commonly supposed to be a place in which the deer have a daily "bee" at road
work all winter long and deliberately keep the snow hammered down so they can run on a hard
surface everywhere within its limits. The fact is, the deer gather in a place where there is
plenty of food and good shelter. The snow does not drift here, so the deer, by continually
moving about, soon make a network of tracks in all directions, extending them as they must
to seek more food. They may, of course, leave the yard at any time, but at once they encounter
the dreaded obstacle of deep, soft snow in which they are helpless.

Once they reached the well-worn trails, the hunters took off their snowshoes and went gently
on these deer paths. They saw one or two disappearing forms, which taught them the thick cover
was hiding many more. They made for the sound of the ravens, and found that the feast of the
sable birds was not a deer but the bodies of three, quite recently killed.

Quonab made a hasty study of the signs and said, "Panther."

Yes, a panther, cougar, or mountain lion also had found the deer yard; and here he was living,
like a rat in a grocer shop with nothing to do but help himself whenever he felt like feasting.

Pleasant for the panther, but hard on the deer; for the killer is wasteful and will often kill
for the joy of murder.

Not a quarter of the carcasses lying here did he eat; he was feeding at least a score of ravens,
and maybe foxes, martens, and lynxes as well.

Before killing a deer, Quonab thought it well to take a quiet prowl around in hopes of seeing
the panther. Skookum was turned loose and encouraged to display his talents.

Proud as a general with an ample and obedient following, he dashed ahead, carrying fresh dismay
among the deer, if one might judge from the noise. Then he found some new smell of excitement,
and voiced the new thrill in a new sound, one not unmixed with fear. At length his barking
was far away to the west in a rocky part of the woods. Whatever the prey, it was treed, for
the voice kept one place.

The hunters followed quickly and found the dog yapping furiously under a thick cedar. The first
thought was of porcupine; but a nearer view showed the game to be a huge panther on the ground,
not greatly excited, disdaining to climb, and taking little notice of the dog, except to curl
his nose and utter a hissing kind of snarl when the latter came too near.

But the arrival of the hunters gave a new colour to the picture. The panther raised his head,
then sprang up a large tree and ensconced himself on a fork, while the valorous Skookum reared
against the trunk, threatening loudly to come up and tear him to pieces.

This was a rare find and a noble chance to conserve their stock of deer, so the hunters went
around the tree seeking for a fair shot. But every point of view had some serious obstacle.
It seemed as though the branches had been told off to guard the panther's vitals, for a big
one always stood in the bullet's way.

After vainly going around, Quonab said to Rolf: "Hit him with something, so he'll move."

Rolf always was a good shot with stones, but he found none to throw. Near where they stood,
however, was an unfreezing spring, and the soggy snow on it was easily packed into a hard,
heavy snowball. Rolf threw it straight, swift, and by good luck it hit the panther square on
the nose and startled him so that he sprang right out of the tree and flopped into the snow.

Skookum was on him at once, but got a slap on the ear that changed his music, and the panther
bounded away out of sight with the valiant Skookum ten feet behind, whooping and yelling like mad.

It was annoyance rather than fear that made that panther take to a low tree while Skookum boxed
the compass, and made a beaten dog path all around him. The hunters approached very carefully
now, making little sound and keeping out of sight. The panther was wholly engrossed with observing
the astonishing impudence of that dog, when Quonab came quietly up, leaned his rifle against
a tree and fired. The smoke cleared to show the panther on his back, his legs convulsively
waving in the air, and Skookum tugging valiantly at his tail.

"My panther," he seemed to say; "whatever would you do without me?"

A panther in a deer yard is much like a wolf shut up in a sheepfold. He would probably have
killed all the deer that winter, though there were ten times as many as he needed for food;
and getting rid of him was a piece of good luck for hunters and deer, while his superb hide
made a noble trophy that in years to come had unexpected places of honour.

Chapter 43. Sunday in the Woods

Rolf still kept to the tradition of Sunday, and Quonab had in a manner accepted it. It was
a curious fact that the red man had far more toleration for the white man's religious ideas
than the white man had for the red's.

Quonab's songs to the sun and the spirit, or his burning of a tobacco pinch, or an animal's
whiskers were to Rolf but harmless nonsense. Had he given them other names, calling them hymns
and incense, he would have been much nearer respecting them. He had forgotten his mother's
teaching: "If any man do anything sincerely, believing that thereby he is worshipping God,
he is worshipping God." He disliked seeing Quonab use an axe or a gun on Sunday, and the Indian,
realizing that such action made "evil medicine" for Rolf, practically abstained. But Rolf had
not yet learned to respect the red yarns the Indian hung from a deer's skull, though he did
come to understand that he must let them alone or produce bad feeling in camp.

Sunday had become a day of rest and Quonab made it also a day of song and remembrance.

They were sitting one Sunday night by the fire in the cabin, enjoying the blaze, while a storm
rattled on the window and door. A white-footed mouse, one of a family that lived in the shanty,
was trying how close he could come to Skookum's nose without being caught, while Rolf looked
on. Quonab was lying back on a pile of deer skins, with his pipe in his mouth, his head on
the bunk, and his hands clasped back of his neck.

There was an atmosphere of content and brotherly feeling; the evening was young, when Rolf
broke silence:

"Were you ever married, Quonab?"

"Ugh," was the Indian's affirmative.

"Where?"

"Myanos."

Rolf did not venture more questions, but left the influence of the hour to work. It was a moment
of delicate poise, and Rolf knew a touch would open the door or double bar it. He wondered
how he might give that touch as he wished it. Skookum still slept. Both men watched the mouse,
as, with quick movements it crept about. Presently it approached a long birch stick that stood
up against the wall. High hanging was the song-drum. Rolf wished Quonab would take it and let
it open his heart, but he dared not offer it; that might have the exact wrong effect. Now the
mouse was behind the birch stick. Then Rolf noticed that the stick if it were to fall would
strike a drying line, one end of which was on the song-drum peg. So he made a dash at the mouse
and displaced the stick; the jerk it gave the line sent the song-drum with hollow bumping to
the ground. The boy stooped to replace it; as he did, Quonab grunted and Rolf turned to see
his hand stretched for the drum. Had Rolf officiously offered it, it would have been refused;
now the Indian took it, tapped and warmed it at the fire, and sang a song of the Wabanaki.
It was softly done, and very low, but Rolf was close, for almost the first time in any long
rendition, and he got an entirely new notion of the red music. The singer's face brightened
as he tummed and sang with peculiar grace notes and throat warbles of "Kaluscap's war with
the magi," and the spirit of his people, rising to the sweet magic of melody, came shining
in his eyes. He sang the lovers' song, "The Bark Canoe." (See F. R. Burton's "American Primitive
Music.)

"While the stars shine and falls the dew, I seek my love in bark canoe."

And then the cradle song,

     "The Naked Bear Shall Never Catch Thee."

When he stopped, he stared at the fire; and after a long pause Rolf ventured, "My mother would
have loved your songs."

Whether he heard or not, the warm emanation surely reached the Indian, and he began to answer
the question of an hour before:

"Her name was Gamowini, for she sang like the sweet night bird at Asamuk. I brought her from
her father's house at Saugatuck. We lived at Myanos. She made beautiful baskets and moccasins.
I fished and trapped; we had enough. Then the baby came. He had big round eyes, so we called
him Wee-wees, 'our little owl,' and we were very happy. When Gamowini sang to her baby, the
world seemed full of sun. One day when Wee-wees could walk she left him with me and she went
to Stamford with some baskets to sell. A big ship was in the harbour. A man from the ship told
her that his sailors would buy all her baskets. She had no fear. On the ship they seized her
for a runaway slave, and hid her till they sailed away.

"When she did not come back I took Wee-wees on my shoulder and went quickly to Stamford. I
soon found out a little, but the people did not know the ship, or whence she came, or where
she went, they said. They did not seem to care. My heart grew hotter and wilder. I wanted to
fight. I would have killed the men on the dock, but they were many. They bound me and put me
in jail for three months. 'When I came out Wee-wees was dead. They did not care. I have heard
nothing since. Then I went to live under the rock, so I should not see our first home. I do
not know; she may be alive. But I think it killed her to lose her baby."

The Indian stopped; then rose quickly. His face was hard set. He stepped out into the snowstorm
and the night. Rolf was left alone with Skookum.

Sad, sad, everything seemed sad in his friend's life, and Rolf, brooding over it with wisdom
beyond his years, could not help asking: "Had Quonab and Gamowini been white folk, would it
have happened so? Would his agony have been received with scornful indifference?" Alas! he
knew it would not. He realized it would have been a very different tale, and the sequent questions
that would not down, were, "Will this bread cast on the waters return after many days?" "Is
there a God of justice and retribution?" "On whom will the flail of vengeance fall for all
these abominations?"

Two hours later the Indian returned. No word was spoken as he entered. He was not cold. He
must have walked far. Rolf prepared for bed. The Indian stooped, picked up a needle from the
dusty ground, one that had been lost the day before, silently handed it to his companion, who
gave only a recognizant "Hm," and dropped it into the birch-bark box.

Chapter 44. The Lost Bundle of Furs

There had been a significant cessation of robbery on their trap line after the inconclusive
visit to the enemy's camp. But a new and extreme exasperation arose in the month of March,
when the alternation of thaw and frost had covered the snow with a hard crust that rendered
snowshoes unnecessary and made it easy to run anywhere and leave no track.

They had gathered up a fisher and some martens before they reached the beaver pond. They had
no beaver traps now, but it was interesting to call and see how many of the beavers were left,
and what they were doing.

Bubbling springs on the bank of the pond had made open water at several places, now that the
winter frost was weakening. Out of these the beavers often came, as was plainly seen in the
tracks, so the trappers approached them carefully.

They were scrutinizing one of them from behind a log, Quonab with ready gun, Rolf holding the
unwilling Skookum, when the familiar broad, flat head appeared. A large beaver swam around
the hole, sniffed and looked, then silently climbed the bank, evidently making for a certain
aspen tree that he had already been cutting. He was in easy range, and the gunner was about
to fire when Rolf pressed his arm and pointed. Here, wandering through the wood, came a large
lynx. It had not seen or smelt any of the living creatures ahead, as yet, but speedily sighted
the beaver now working away to cut down his tree.

As a pelt, the beaver was worth more than the lynx, but the naturalist is strong in most hunters,
and they watched to see what would happen.

The lynx seemed to sink into the ground, and was lost to sight as soon as he knew of a possible
prey ahead. And now he began his stalk. The hunters sighted him once as he crossed a level
opening in the snow. He seemed less than four inches high as he crawled. Logs, ridges, trees,
or twigs, afforded ample concealment, till his whiskers appeared in a thicket within fifteen
feet of the beaver.

All this was painfully exciting to Skookum, who, though he could not see, could get some thrilling
whiffs, and he strained forward to improve his opportunities. The sound of this slight struggle
caught the beaver's ear. It stopped work, wheeled, and made for the water hole. The lynx sprang
from his ambush, seized the beaver by the back, and held on; but the beaver was double the
lynx's weight, the bank was steep and slippery, the struggling animals kept rolling down hill,
nearer and nearer the hole. Then, on the very edge, the beaver gave a great plunge, and splashed
into the water with the lynx clinging to its back. At once they disappeared, and the hunters
rushed to the place, expecting them to float up and be an easy prey; but they did not float.
At length it was clear that the pair had gone under the ice, for in water the beaver was master.

After five minutes it was certain that the lynx must be dead. Quonab cut a sapling and made
a grappler. He poked this way and that way under the ice, until at length he felt something
soft. With the hatchet they cut a hole over the place and then dragged out the body of the
lynx. The beaver, of course, escaped and was probably little the worse.

While Quonab skinned the catch, Rolf prowled around the pond and soon came running back to
tell of a remarkable happening.

At another open hole a beaver had come out, wandered twenty yards to a mound which he had castorized,
then passed several hard wood trees to find a large poplar or aspen, the favourite food tree.
This he had begun to fell with considerable skill, but for some strange reason, perhaps because
alone, he had made a miscalculation, and when the tree came crashing down, it had fallen across
his back, killed him, and pinned him to the ground.

It was an easy matter for the hunters to remove the log and secure his pelt, so they left the
beaver pond, richer than they had expected.

Next night, when they reached their half-way shanty, they had the best haul they had taken
on this line since the memorable day when they got six beavers.

The morning dawned clear and bright. As they breakfasted, they noticed an extraordinary gathering
of ravens far away to the north, beyond any country they had visited. At least twenty or thirty
of the birds were sailing in great circles high above a certain place, uttering a deep, sonorous
croak, from time to time. Occasionally one of the ravens would dive down out of sight.

"Why do they fly above that way?"

"That is to let other ravens know there is food here. Their eyes are very good. They can see
the signal ten miles away, so all come to the place. My father told me that you can gather
all the ravens for twenty miles by leaving a carcass so they can see it and signal each other."

"Seems as if we should look into that. Maybe another panther," was Rolf's remark.

The Indian nodded; so leaving the bundle of furs in a safe place with the snowshoes, that they
carried on a chance, they set out over the hard crust. It was two or three miles to the ravens'
gathering, and, as before, it proved to be over a cedar brake where was a deer yard.

Skookum knew all about it. He rushed into the woods, filled with the joy of martial glory.
But speedily came running out again as hard as he could, yelling "yow, yow, yowl" for help,
while swiftly following, behind him were a couple of gray wolves. Quonab waited till they were
within forty yards; then, seeing the men, the wolves slowed up and veered; Quonab fired; one
of the wolves gave a little, doglike yelp. Then they leaped into the bushes and were lost to view.

A careful study of the snow showed one or two trifling traces of blood. In the deer yard they
found at least a dozen carcasses of deer killed by the wolves, but none very recent. They saw
but few deer and nothing more of the wolves, for the crust had made all the country easy, and
both kinds fled before the hunters.

Exploring a lower level of willow country in hopes of finding beaver delayed them, and it was
afternoon when they returned to the half-way shanty, to find everything as they left it, except
that their Pack of furs had totally disappeared.

Of course, the hard crust gave no sign of track. Their first thought was of the old enemy,
but, seeking far and near for evidence, they found pieces of an ermine skin, and a quarter
mile farther, the rest of it, then, at another place, fragments of a muskrat's skin. Those
made it look like the work of the trapper's enemy, the wolverine, which, though rare, was surely
found in these hills. Yes! there was a wolverine scratch mark, and here another piece of the
rat skin. It was very clear who was the thief.

"He tore up the cheapest ones of the lot anyway," said Rolf.

Then the trappers stared at each other significantly--only the cheap ones destroyed; why should
a wolverine show such discrimination? There was no positive sign of wolverine; in fact, the
icy snow gave no sign of anything. There was little doubt that the tom furs and the scratch
marks were there to mislead; that this was the work of a human robber, almost certainly Hoag.

He had doubtless seen them leave in the morning, and it was equally sure, since he had had
hours of start, he would now be far away.

"Ugh! Give him few days to think he safe, then I follow and settle all," and this time the
Indian clearly meant to end the matter.

Chapter 45. The Subjugation of Hoag

     A feller as weeps for pity and never does a finger-tap to
     help is 'bout as much use as an overcoat on a drowning man.
     --Sayings of Si Sylvanne.

SOME remarkable changes of weather made some remarkable changes in their plan and saved their
enemy from immediate molestation. For two weeks it was a succession of thaws and there was
much rain. The lake was covered with six inches of water; the river had a current above the
ice, that was rapidly eating, the latter away. Everywhere there were slush and wet snow that
put an end to travel and brought on the spring with a rush.

Each night there was, indeed, a trifling frost, but each day's sun seemed stronger, and broad,
bare patches of ground appeared on all sunny slopes.

On the first crisp day the trappers set out to go the rounds, knowing full well that this was
the end of the season. Henceforth for six months deadfall and snare would lie idle and unset.

They went their accustomed line, carrying their snowshoes, but rarely needing them. Then they
crossed a large track to which Quonab pointed, and grunted affirmatively as Rolf said "Bear?"
Yes! the bears were about once more; their winter sleep was over. Now they were fat and the
fur was yet prime; in a month they would be thin and shedding. Now is the time for bear hunting
with either trap or dog.

Doubtless Skookum thought the party most fortunately equipped in the latter respect, but no
single dog is enough to bay a bear. There must be three or four to bother him behind, to make
him face about and fight; one dog merely makes him run faster.

They had no traps, and knowing that a spring bear is a far traveller, they made no attempt
to follow.

The deadfalls yielded two martens, but one of them was spoiled by the warm weather. They learned
at last that the enemy had a trap-line, for part of which he used their deadfalls. He had been
the rounds lately and had profited at least a little by their labours.

The track, though two days old, was not hard to follow, either on snow or ground. Quonab looked
to the lock of his gun; his lower lip tightened and he strode along.

"What are you going to do, Quonab? Not shoot?"

"When I get near enough," and the dangerous look in the red man's eye told Rolf to be quiet
and follow.

In three miles they passed but three of his marten traps--very lazy trapping--and then found
a great triangle of logs by a tree with a bait and signs enough to tell the experienced eye
that, in that corner, was hidden a huge steel trap for bear.

They were almost too late in restraining the knowledge-hunger of Skookum. They went on a mile
or two and realized in so doing that, however poor a trapper the enemy might be, he was a good
tramper and knew the country.

At sundown they came to their half-way shelter and put up there for the night. Once when Rolf
went out to glimpse the skies before turning in, he heard a far tree creaking and wondered,
for it was dead calm. Even Skookum noticed it. But it was not repeated. Next morning they went on.

There are many quaint sounds in the woods at all times, the rasping of trees, at least a dozen
different calls by jays, twice as many by ravens, and occasional notes from chicadees, grouse,
and owls. The quadrupeds in general are more silent, but the red squirrel is ever about and
noisy, as well as busy.

Far-reaching sounds are these echoes of the woods--some of them very far. Probably there were
not five minutes of the day or night when some weird, woodland chatter, scrape, crack, screech,
or whistle did not reach the keen ears of that ever-alert dog. That is, three hundred times
a day his outer ear submitted to his inner ear some report of things a-doing, which same report
was as often for many days disregarded as of no interest or value. But this did not mean that
he missed anything; the steady tramp, tramp of their feet, while it dulled all sounds for the
hunter, seemed to have no effect on Skookum. Again the raspy squeal of some far tree reached
his inmost brain, and his hair rose as he stopped and gave a low "woof."

The hunters held still; the wise ones always do, when a dog says "Stop!" They waited. After
a few minutes it came again--merely the long-drawn creak of a tree bough, wind-rubbed on its
neighbour.

And yet, "Woof, woof, woof," said Skookum, and ran ahead.

"Come back, you little fool!" cried Rolf.

But Skookum had a mind of his own. He trotted ahead, then stopped, paused, and sniffed at something
in the snow. The Indian picked it up. It was the pocket jackscrew that every bear trapper carries
to set the powerful trap, and without which, indeed, one man cannot manage the springs.

He held it up with "Ugh! Hoag in trouble now." Clearly the rival trapper had lost this necessary
tool.

But the finding was an accident. Skookum pushed on. They came along a draw to a little hollow.
The dog, far forward, began barking and angrily baying at something. The men hurried to the
scene to find on the snow, fast held in one of those devilish engines called a bear trap--the
body of their enemy--Hoag, the trapper, held by a leg, and a hand in the gin he himself had
been setting.

A fierce light played on the Indian's face. Rolf was stricken with horror. But even while they
contemplated the body, the faint cry was heard again coming from it.

"He's alive; hurry!" cried Rolf. The Indian did not hurry, but he came. He had vowed vengeance
at sight; why should he haste to help?

The implacable iron jaws had clutched the trapper by one knee and the right hand. The first
thing was to free him. How? No man has power enough to force that spring. But the jackscrew!

"Quonab, help him! For God's sake, come!" cried Rolf in agony, forgetting their feud and seeing
only tortured, dying man.

The Indian gazed a moment, then rose quickly, and put on the jackscrew. Under his deft fingers
the first spring went down, but what about the other? They had no other screw. The long buckskin
line they always carried was quickly lashed round and round the down spring to hold it. Then
the screw was removed and put on the other spring; it bent, and the jaws hung loose. The Indian
forced them wide open, drew out the mangled limbs, a the trapper was free, but so near death,
it seemed they were too late.

Rolf spread his coat. The Indian made a fire. In fifteen minutes they were pouring hot tea
between victim's lips. Even as they did, his feeble throat gave out again the long, low moan.

The weather was mild now. The prisoner was not actually frozen, but numbed and racked. Heat,
hot tea, kindly rubbing, and he revived a little.

At first they thought him dying, but in an hour recovered enough to talk. In feeble accents
and broken phrases they learned the tale:

"Yest--m-m-m. Yesterday--no; two or three days back--m-m-m-m-m--I dunno; I was a goin'--roun'
me traps--me bear traps. Didn't have no luck m-m-m (yes, I'd like another sip; ye ain't got
no whiskey no?) m-m-m. Nothing in any trap, and when I come to this un--oh-h--m-m; I seen--the
bait was stole by birds, an' the pan--m-m-m; an' the pan, m-m-m--(yes, that's better)--an'
the pan laid bare. So I starts to cover it with--ce-ce-dar; the ony thing I c'd get--m-m-m-w---wuz
leanin' over--to fix tother side--me foot slipped on--the--ice--ev'rything was icy--an'--m-m-m-m--I
lost--me balance--me knee the pan--O Lord--how I suffer!--m-m-m it grabbed me--knee an'--h-h-hand--"
His voice died to a whisper and ceased; he seemed sinking.

Quonab got up to hold him. Then, looking at Rolf, Indian shook his head as though to say all
was over; the poor wretch had a woodman's constitution, and in spite of a mangled, dying body,
he revived again. They gave him more hot tea, and again he began in a whisper:

"I hed one arm free an'--an'--an'--I might--a--got out--m-m--but I hed no wrench--I lost it
some place--m-m-m-m.

"Then--I yelled--I dun--no--maybe some un might hear--it kin-kin-kinder eased me--to yell m-m-m.

"Say--make that yer dog keep--away--will yer I dunno--it seems like a week--must a fainted
some M-m-m--I yelled--when I could."

There was a long pause. Rolf said, "Seems to me I heard you last night, when we were up there.
And dog heard you, too. Do you want me to move that leg around?"

"M-m-m--yeh--that's better--say, you air white--ain't ye? Ye won't leave me--cos--I done some
mean things--m-m-m. Ye won't, will ye?"

"No, you needn't worry--we'll stay by ye."

Then he muttered, they could not tell what. He closed his eyes. After long silence he looked
around wildly and began again:

"Say--I done you dirt--but don't leave me--don't leave me." Tears ran down his face and he
moaned piteously. "I'll--make it--right--you're white, ain't ye?"

Quonab rose and went for more firewood. The trapper whispered, "I'm scared o' him--now--he'll
do me--say, I'm jest a poor ole man. If I do live--through--this--m-m-m-m--I'll never walk
again. I'm crippled sure."

It was long before he resumed. Then he began: "Say, what day is it--Friday!--I must--been two
days in there--m-m-m--I reckoned it was a week. When--the--dog came I thought it was wolves.
Oh--ah, didn't care much--m-m-m. Say, ye won't leave me--coz--coz--I treated--ye mean. I--ain't
had no l-l-luck." He went off into a stupor, but presently let out a long, startling cry, the
same as that they had heard in the night. The dog growled; the men stared. The wretch's eyes
were rolling again. He seemed delirious.

Quonab pointed to the east, made the sun-up sign, and shook his head at the victim. And Rolf
understood it to mean that he would never see the sunrise. But they were wrong.

The long night passed in a struggle between heath and the tough make-up of a mountaineer. The
waiting light of dawn saw death defeated, retiring from the scene. As the sun rose high, the
victim seemed to gain considerably in strength. There was no immediate danger of an end.

Rolf said to Quonab: "Where shall we take him? Guess you better go home for the toboggan, and
we'll fetch him to the shanty."

But the invalid was able to take part in the conversation. "Say, don't take me there. Ah--want
to go home. 'Pears like--I'd be better at home. My folks is out Moose River way. I'd never
get out if I went in there," and by "there" he seemed to mean the Indian's lake, and glanced
furtively at the unchanging countenance of the red man.

"Have you a toboggan at your shanty?" asked Rolf.

"Yes--good enough--it's on the roof--say," and he beckoned feebly to Rolf, "let him go after
it--don't leave me--he'll kill me," and he wept feebly in his self pity.

So Quonab started down the mountain--a sinewy man--a striding form, a speck in the melting
distance.

Chapter 46. Nursing Hoag

In two hours the red man reached the trapper's shanty, and at once, without hesitation or delicacy,
set about a thorough examination of its contents. Of course there was the toboggan on the roof,
and in fairly good condition for such a shiftless owner.

There were bunches of furs hanging from the rafters, but not many, for fur taking is hard work;
and Quonab, looking suspiciously over them, was 'not surprised to see the lynx skin he had
lost, easily known by the absence of wound and the fur still in points as it had dried from
the wetting. In another bundle, he discovered the beaver that had killed itself, for there
was the dark band across its back.

The martens he could not be sure of, but he had a strong suspicion that most of this fur came
out of his own traps.

He tied Hoag's blankets on the toboggan, and hastened back to where he left the two on the
mountain.

Skookum met him long before he was near. Skookum did not enjoy Hoag's company.

The cripple had been talking freely to Rolf, but the arrival of the Indian seemed to suppress him.

With the wounded man on the toboggan, they set out, The ground was bare in many places, so
that the going was hard; but, fortunately, it was all down hill, and four hours' toil brought
them to the cabin.

They put the sick man in his bunk, then Rolf set about preparing a meal, while Quonab cut wood.

After the usual tea, bacon, and flour cakes, all were feeling refreshed. Hoag seemed much more
like himself. He talked freely, almost cheerfully, while Quonab, with Skookum at his feet,
sat silently smoking and staring into the fire.

After a long silence, the Indian turned, looked straight at the trapper, and, pointing with
his pipestem to the furs, said, "How many is ours?"

Hoag looked scared, then sulky, and said; "I dunno what ye mean. I'm a awful sick man. You
get me out to Lyons Falls all right, and ye can have the hull lot," and he wept.

Rolf shook his head at Quonab, then turned to the sufferer and said: "Don't you worry; we'll
get you out all right. Have you a good canoe?"

"Pretty fair; needs a little fixing."

The night passed with one or two breaks, when the invalid asked for a drink of water. In the
morning he was evidently recovering, and they began to plan for the future.

He took the first chance of wispering to Rolf, "Can't you send him away? I'll be all right
with you." Rolf said nothing.

"Say," he continued, "say, young feller, what's yer name?"

"Rolf Kittering."

"Say, Rolf, you wait a week or ten days, and the ice 'll be out; then I'll be fit to travel.
There ain't on'y a few carries between here an' Lyons Falls."

After a long pause, due to Quonab's entry, he continued again: "Moose River's good canoeing;
ye can get me out in five days; me folks is at Lyons Falls." He did not say that his folks
consisted of a wife and boy that he neglected, but whom he counted on to nurse him now.

Rolf was puzzled by the situation.

"Say! I'll give ye all them furs if ye git me out." Rolf gave him a curious look--as much as
to say, "Ye mean our furs."

Again the conversation was ended by the entry of Quonab.

Rolf stepped out, taking the Indian with him. They had a long talk, then, as Rolf reentered,
the sick man began:

"You stay by me, and git me out. I'll give ye my rifle"--then, after a short silence--"an'
I'll throw in all the traps an' the canoe."

"I'll stay by you," said Rolf, "and in about two weeks we'll take you down to Lyons Falls.
I guess you can guide us."

"Ye can have all them pelts," and again the trapper presented the spoils he had stolen, "an'
you bet it's your rifle when ye get me out."

So it was arranged. But it was necessary for Quonab to go back to their own cabin. Now what
should he do? Carry the new lot of fur there, or bring the old lot here to dispose of all at
Lyons Falls?

Rolf had been thinking hard. He had seen the evil side of many men, including Hoag. To go among
Hoag's people with a lot of stuff that Hoag might claim was running risks, so he said:

"Quonab, you come back in not more than ten days. We'll take a few furs to Lyons Falls so we
can get supplies. Leave the rest of them in good shape, so we can go out later to Warren's.
We'll get a square deal there, and we don't know what at Lyon's."

So they picked out the lynx, the beaver, and a dozen martens to leave, and making the rest
into a pack, Quonab shouldered them, and followed by Skookum, trudged up the mountain and was
lost to view in the woods.

The ten days went by very slowly. Hoag was alternately querulous, weeping, complaining, unpleasantly
fawning, or trying to insure good attention by presenting again and again the furs, the gun,
and the canoe.

Rolf found it pleasant to get away from the cabin when the weather was fine. One day, taking
Hoag's gun, he travelled up the nearest stream for a mile, and came on a big beaver pond. Round
this he scouted and soon discovered a drowned beaver, held in a trap which he recognized at
once, for it had the (" ' "') mark on the frame. Then he found an empty trap with a beaver
leg in it, and another, till six traps were found. Then he gathered up the six and the beaver,
and returned to the cabin to be greeted with a string of complaints:

"Ye didn't ought to leave me like this. I'm paying ye well enough. I don't ax no favours," etc.

"See what I got," and Rolf showed the beaver. "An' see what I found;" then he showed the traps.
"Queer, ain't it," he went on, "we had six traps just like them, and I marked the face just
like these, and they all disappeared, and there was a snowshoe trail pointing this way. You
haven't got any crooked neighbours about here, have you?"

The trapper looked sulky and puzzled, and grumbled, "I bet it was Bill Hawkins done it"; then
relapsed into silence.

Chapter 47. Hoag's Home-coming

     When it comes to personal feelin's better let yer friends
     do the talkin' and jedgin'.  A man can't handle his own
     case any more than a delirious doctor kin give hisself the
     right physic--Sayings of Si Sylvanne.

The coming of springtime in the woods is one of the gentlest, sweetest advents in the world.
Sometimes there are heavy rains which fill all the little rivers with an overflood that quickly
eats away the ice and snow, but usually the woodland streams open, slowly and gradually. Very
rarely is there a spate, an upheaval, and a cataclysmal sweep that bursts the ice and ends
its reign in an hour or two. That is the way of the large rivers, whose ice is free and floating.
The snow in the forest melts slowly, and when the ice is attacked, it goes gradually, gently,
without uproar. The spring comes in the woods with swelling of buds and a lengthening of drooping
catkins, with honking of wild geese, and cawing of crows coming up from the lower countries
to divide with their larger cousins, the ravens, the spoils of winter's killing.

The small birds from the South appear with a few short notes of spring, and the pert chicadees
that have braved it all winter, now lead the singing with their cheery "I told you so" notes,
till robins and blackbirds join in, and with their more ambitious singing make all the lesser
roundelays forgot.

Once the winter had taken a backward step--spring found it easy to turn retreat into panic
and rout; and the ten days Quonab stayed away were days of revolutionary change. For in them
semi-winter gave place to smiling spring, with all the snow-drifts gone, except perhaps in
the shadiest hollows of the woods.

It was a bright morning, and a happy one for Rolf, when he heard the Indian's short "Ho," outside,
and a minute later had Skookum dancing and leaping about him. On Hoag the effect was quite
different. He was well enough to be up, to hobble about painfully on a stick; to be exceedingly
fault-finding, and to eat three hearty meals a day; but the moment the Indian appeared, he
withdrew into himself, and became silent and uneasy. Before an hour passed, he again presented
the furs, the gun, the canoe, and the traps to Rolf, on condition that he should get him out
to his folks.

All three were glad to set out that very day on the outward trip to Lyons Falls.

Down Little Moose River to Little Moose Lake and on to South Branch of Moose, then by the Main
Moose, was their way. The streams were flush; there was plenty of water, and this fortunately
reduced the number of carries; for Hoag could not walk and would not hobble. They sweat and
laboured to carry him over every portage; but they covered the fifty miles in three days, and
on the evening of the third, arrived at the little backwoods village of Lyons Falls.

The change that took place in Hoag now was marked and unpleasant. He gave a number of orders,
where, the day before, he would have made whining petitions. He told them to "land easy, and
don't bump my canoe." He hailed the loungers about the mill with an effusiveness that they
did not respond to. Their cool, "Hello, Jack, are you back?" was little but a passing recognition.
One of them was persuaded to take Rolf's place in carrying Hoag to his cabin. Yes, his folks
were there, but they did not seem overjoyed at his arrival. He whispered to the boy, who sullenly
went out to the river and returned with the rifle, Rolf's rifle now, the latter supposed, and
would have taken the bundle of furs had not Skookum sprung on the robber and driven him away
from the canoe.

And now Hoag showed his true character. "Them's my furs and my canoe," he said to one of the
mill hands, and turning to the two who had saved him, he said: "An' you two dirty, cutthroat,
redskin thieves, you can get out of town as fast as ye know how, or I'll have ye jugged," and
all the pent-up hate of his hateful nature frothed out in words insulting and unprintable.

"Talks like a white man," said Quonab coldly. Rolf was speechless. To toil so devotedly, and
to have such filthy, humiliating words for thanks! He wondered if even his Uncle Mike would
have shown so vile a spirit.

Hoag gave free rein to his tongue, and found in his pal, Bill Hawkins, one with ready ears
to hear his tale of woe. The wretch began to feel himself frightfully ill-used. So, fired at
last by the evermore lurid story of his wrongs, the "partner" brought the magistrate, so they
could swear out a warrant, arrest the two "outlaws," and especially secure the bundle of "Hoag's
furs" in the canoe.

Old Silas Sylvanne, the mill-owner and pioneer of the place, was also its magistrate. He was
tall, thin, blacklooking, a sort of Abe Lincoln in type, physically, and in some sort, mentally.
He heard the harrowing tale of terrible crime, robbery, and torture, inflicted on poor harmless
Hoag by these two ghouls in human shape; he listened, at first shocked, but little by little
amused.

"You don't get no warrant till I hear from the other side," he said. Roff and Quonab came at
call. The old pioneer sized up the two, as they stood, then, addressing Rolf, said:

"Air you an Injun?" "No, sir." "Air you half-breed?" "No, sir." "Well, let's hear about this
business," and he turned his piercing eyes full on the lad's face.

Rolf told the simple, straight story of their acquaintance with Hoag, from the first day at
Warren's to their arrival at the Falls. There is never any doubt about the truth of a true
story, if it be long enough, and this true story, presented in its nakedness to the shrewd
and kindly old hunter, trader, mill-owner and magistrate, could have only one effect.

"Sonny," he said, slowly and kindly, "I know that ye have told me the truth. I believe every
word of it. We all know that Hoag is the meanest cuss and biggest liar on the river. He's a
nuisance, and always was. He only promised to give ye the canoe and the rifle, and since he
don't want to, we can't help it. About the trouble in the woods, you got two witnesses to his
one, and ye got the furs and the traps; it's just as well ye left the other furs behind, or
ye might have had to divide 'em; so keep them and call the hull thing square. We'll find ye
a canoe to get out of this gay metropolis, and as to Hoag, ye needn't a-worry; his travelling
days is done."

A man with a bundle of high-class furs is a man of means in any frontier town. The magistrate
was trader, too, so they set about disposing of their furs and buying the supplies they needed.

The day was nearly done before their new canoe was gummed and ready with the new supplies.
When dealing, old Sylvanne had a mild, quiet manner, and a peculiar way of making funny remarks
that led some to imagine he was "easy" in business; but it was usual to find at the end that
he had lost nothing by his manners, and rival traders shunned an encounter with Long Sylvanne
of the unruffled brow.

When business was done--keen and complete--he said: "Now, I'm a goin' to give each of ye a
present," and handed out two double-bladed jackknives, new things in those days, wonderful
things, precious treasures in their eyes, sources of endless joy; and even had they known that
one marten skin would buy a quart of them, their pleasant surprise and childish joy would not
have been in any way tempered or alloyed.

"Ye better eat with me, boys, an' start in the morning." So they joined the miller's long,
continuous family, and shared his evening meal. Afterward as they sat for three hours and smoked
on the broad porch that looked out on the river, old Sylvanne, who had evidently taken a fancy
to Rolf, regaled them with a long, rambling talk on "fellers and things," that was one of the
most interesting Rolf had ever listened to. At the time it was simply amusing; it was not till
years after that the lad realized by its effect on himself, its insight, and its hold on his
memory, that Si Sylvanne's talk was real wisdom. Parts of it would not look well in print;
but the rugged words, the uncouth Saxonism, the obscene phrase, were the mere oaken bucket
in which the pure and precious waters were hauled to the surface.

"Looked like he had ye pinched when that shyster got ye in to Lyons Falls. Wall, there's two
bad places for Jack Hoag; one is where they don't know him at all, an' take him on his looks;
an' t'other is where they know him through and through for twenty years, like we hev. A smart
rogue kin put up a false front fer a year or maybe two, but given twenty year to try him, for
and bye, summer an' winter, an' I reckon a man's make is pretty well showed up, without no
dark corners left unexplored.

"Not that I want to jedge him harsh, coz I don't know what kind o' maggots is eatin' his innards
to make him so ornery. I'm bound to suppose he has 'em, or he wouldn't act so dum like it.
So I says, go slow and gentle before puttin' a black brand on any feller; as my mother used
to say, never say a bad thing till ye ask, 'Is it true, is it kind, is it necessary?' An' I
tell you, the older I git, the slower I jedge; when I wuz your age, I wuz a steel trap on a
hair trigger, an' cocksure. I tell you, there ain't anythin' wiser nor a sixteen-year-old boy,
'cept maybe a fifteen-year-old girl.

"Ye'll genilly find, lad, jest when things looks about as black as they kin look, that's the
sign of luck a-comin' your way, pervidin' ye hold steady, keep cool and kind; something happens
every time to make it all easy. There's always a way, an' the stout heart will find it.

"Ye may be very sure o' this, boy, yer never licked till ye think ye air an' if ye won't think
it, ye can't be licked. It's just the same as being sick. I seen a lot o' doctorin' in my day,
and I'm forced to believe there ain't any sick folks 'cept them that thinks they air sick.

"The older I git, the more I'm bound to consider that most things is inside, anyhow, and what's
outside don't count for much.

"So it stands to reason when ye play the game for what's inside, ye win over all the outside
players. When ye done kindness to Hoag, ye mightn't a meant it, but ye was bracin' up the goodness
in yerself, or bankin' it up somewher' on the trail ahead, where it was needed. And he was
simply chawin' his own leg off, when he done ye dirt. I ain't much o' a prattlin' Christian,
but I reckon as a cold-blooded, business proposition it pays to lend the neighbour a hand;
not that I go much on gratitude. It's scarcer'n snowballs in hell--which ain't the point; but
I take notice there ain't any man'll hate ye more'n the feller that knows he's acted mean to
ye. An' there ain't any feller more ready to fight yer battles than the chap that by some dum
accident has hed the luck to help ye, even if he only done it to spite some one else--which
'minds me o' McCarthy's bull pup that saved the drowning kittens by mistake, and ever after
was a fightin' cat protector, whereby he lost the chief joy o' his life, which had been cat-killin'.
An' the way they cured the cat o' eatin' squirrels was givin' her a litter o' squirrels to raise.

"I tell ye there's a lot o' common-sense an' kindness in the country, only it's so dum slow
to git around; while the cussedness and meanness always acts like they felt the hell fire sizzlin'
their hind-end whiskers, an' knowed they had jest so many minutes to live an' make a record.
There's where a man's smart that fixes things so he kin hold out a long time, fer the good
stuff in men's minds is what lasts; and the feller what can stay with it hez proved hisself
by stayin'. How'd ye happen to tie up with the Injun, Rolf?"

"Do ye want me to tell it long or short?" was the reply. "Wall, short, fer a start," and Silas
Sylvanne chuckled.

So Rolf gave a very brief account of his early life.

"Pretty good," said the miller; "now let's hear it long."

And when he had finished, the miller said: "I've seen yer tried fer most everything that goes
to make a man, Rolf, an' I hev my own notion of the results. You ain't goin' to live ferever
in them hills. When ye've hed yer fling an' want a change, let me know."

Early next day the two hunters paddled up the Moose River with a good canoe, an outfit of groceries,
and a small supply of ready cash.

"Good-bye, lad, good-bye! Come back again and ye'll find we improve on acquaintance; an' don't
forget I'm buying fur," was Si Sylvanne's last word. And as they rounded the point, on the
home way, Rolf turned in the canoe, faced Quonab, and said: "Ye see there are some good white
men left;" but the Indian neither blinked, nor moved, nor made a sound.

Chapter 48. Rolf's Lesson in Trailing

The return journey was hard paddling against strong waters, but otherwise uneventful. Once
over any trail is enough to fix it in the memory of a woodman. They made no mistakes and their
loads were light, so the portages were scarcely any loss of time, and in two days they were
back at Hoag's cabin.

Of this they took possession. First, they gathered all things of value, and that was little
since the furs and bedding were gone, but there were a few traps and some dishes. The stuff
was made in two packs; now it was an overland journey, so the canoe was hidden in a cedar thicket,
a quarter of a mile inland. The two were about to shoulder the packs, Quonab was lighting his
pipe for a start, when Rolf said:

"Say, Quonab! that fellow we saw at the Falls claimed to be Hoag's partner. He may come on
here and make trouble if we don't head him off. Let's burn her," and he nodded toward the shanty.

"Ugh!" was the reply.

They gathered some dry brush and a lot of birch bark, piled them up against the wall inside,
and threw plenty of firewood on this. With flint and steel Quonab made the vital spark, the
birch bark sputtered, the dry, resinous logs were easily set ablaze, and soon great volumes
of smoke rolled from the door, the window, and the chimney; and Skookum, standing afar, barked
pleasantly aloud.

The hunters shouldered their packs and began the long, upward slope. In an hour they had reached
a high, rocky ridge. Here they stopped to rest, and, far below them, marked with grim joy a
twisted, leaning column of thick black smoke.

That night they camped in the woods and next day rejoiced to be back again at their own cabin,
their own lake, their home.

Several times during the march they had seen fresh deer tracks, and now that the need of meat
was felt, Rolf proposed a deer hunt.

Many deer die every winter; some are winter-killed; many are devoured by beasts of prey, or
killed by hunters; their numbers are at low ebb in April, so that now one could not count on
finding a deer by roaming at random. It was a case for trailing.

Any one can track a deer in the snow. It is not very hard to follow a deer in soft ground,
when there are no other deer about. But it is very hard to take one deer trail and follow it
over rocky ground and dead leaves, never losing it or changing off, when there are hundreds
of deer tracks running in all directions.

Rolf's eyes were better than Quonab's, but experience counts for as much as eyes, and Quonab
was leading. They picked out a big buck track that was fresh--no good hunter kills a doe at
this season. They knew it for a buck, because of its size and the roundness of the toes.

Before long, Rolf said: "See, Quonab, I want to learn this business; let me do the trailing,
and you set me right if I get off the line."

Within a hundred yards, Quonab gave a grunt and shook his head. Rolf looked surprised, for
he was on a good, fresh track.

Quonab said but one word, "Doe."

Yes, a closer view showed the tracks to be a little narrower, a little closer together, and
a little sharper than those he began with.

Back went Rolf to the last marks that he was sure of, and plainly read where the buck had turned
aside. For a time, things went along smoothly, Quonab and Skookum following Rolf. The last
was getting very familiar with that stub hoof on the left foot. At length they came to the
"fumet" or "sign"; it was all in one pile. That meant the deer had stood, so was unalarmed;
and warm; that meant but a few minutes ahead. Now, they must use every precaution for this
was the crux of the hunt. Of this much only they were sure--the deer was within range now,
and to get him they must see him before he saw them.

Skookum was leashed. Rolf was allowed to get well ahead, and crawling cautiously, a step at
a time, he went, setting down his moccasined foot only after he had tried and selected a place.
Once or twice he threw into the air a tuft of dry grass to make sure that the wind was right,
and by slow degrees he reached the edge of a little opening.

Across this he peered long, without entering it. Then he made a sweep with his hand and pointed,
to let Quonab know the buck had gone across and he himself must go around. But he lingered
still and with his eyes swept the near woods. Then, dim gray among the gray twigs, he saw a
slight movement, so slight it might have been made by the tail of a tomtit. But it fixed his
attention, and out of this gray haze he slowly made out the outline of a deer's head, antlers,
and neck. A hundred yards away, but "take a chance when it comes" is hunter wisdom. Rolf glanced
at the sight, took steady aim, fired, and down went the buck behind a log. Skookum whined and
leaped high in his eagerness to see. Rolf restrained his impatience to rush forward, at once
reloaded, then all three went quickly to the place. Before they were within fifty yards, the
deer leaped up and bounded off. At seventy-five yards, it stood for a moment to gaze. Rolf
fired again; again the buck fell down, but jumped to its feet and bounded away.

They went to the two places, but found no blood. Utterly puzzled, they gave it up for the day,
as already the shades of night were on the woods, and in spite of Skookum's voluble offer to
solve and settle everything, they returned to the cabin.

"What do you make of it, Quonab?'

The Indian shook his head, then: "Maybe touched his head and stunned him, first shot; second,
wah! I not know."

"I know this," said Rolf. "I touched him and I mean to get him in the morning."

True to this resolve, he was there again at dawn, but examined the place in vain for a sign
of blood. The red rarely shows up much on leaves, grass, or dust; but there are two kinds of
places that the hunter can rely on as telltales--stones and logs. Rolf followed the deer track,
now very dim, till at a bare place he found a speck of blood on a pebble. Here the trail joined
onto a deer path, with so many tracks that it was hard to say which was the right one. But
Rolf passed quickly along to a log that crossed the runway, and on that log he found a drop
of dried-up blood that told him what he wished to know.

Now he had a straight run of a quarter of a mile, and from time to time he saw a peculiar scratching
mark that puzzled him. Once he found a speck of blood at one of these scratches but no other
evidence that the buck was touched.

A wounded deer is pretty sure to work down hill, and Quonab, leaving Skookum with Rolf, climbed
a lookout that might show whither the deer was heading.

After another half mile, the deer path forked; there were buck trails on both, and Rolf could
not pick out the one he wanted. He went a few yards along each, studying the many marks, but
was unable to tell which was that of the wounded buck.

Now Skookum took a share in it. He had always been forbidden to run deer and knew it was a
contraband amusement, but he put his nose to that branch of the trail that ran down hill, followed
it for a few yards, then looked at Rolf, as much as to say: "You poor nose-blind creature;
don't you know a fresh deer track when you smell it? Here it is; this is where he went."

Rolf stared, then said, "I believe he means it"; and followed the lower trail. Very soon he
came to another scrape, and, just beyond it, found the new, velvet-covered antler of a buck,
raw and bloody, and splintered at the base.

From this on, the task was easier, as there were no other tracks, and this was pointing steadily
down hill.

Soon Quonab came striding along. He had not seen the buck, but a couple of jays and a raven
were gathered in a thicket far down by the stream. The hunters quit the trail and made for
that place. As they drew near, they found the track again, and again saw those curious scrapes.

Every hunter knows that the bluejay dashing about a thicket means that hidden there is game
of some kind, probably deer. Very, very slowly and silently they entered that copse. But nothing
appeared until there was a rush in the thickest part and up leaped the buck. This was too much
for Skookum. He shot forward like a wolf, fastened on one hind leg, and the buck went crashing
head over heels. Before it could rise, another shot ended its troubles. And now a careful study
shed the light desired. Rolf's first shot had hit the antler near the base, breaking it, except
for the skin on one side, and had stunned the buck. The second shot had broken a hind leg.
The scratching places he had made were efforts to regain the use of this limb, and at one of
them the deer had fallen and parted the rag of skin by which the antler hung.

It was Rolf's first important trailing on the ground; it showed how possible it was, and how
quickly he was learning the hardest of all the feats of woodcraft.

Chapter 49. Rolf Gets Lost

Every one who lives in the big woods gets lost at some time. Yes, even Daniel Boone did sometimes
go astray. And whether it is to end as a joke or a horrible tragedy depends entirely on the
way in which the person takes it. This is, indeed, the grand test of a hunter and scout, the
trial of his knowledge, his muscle, and, above everything, his courage; and, like all supreme
trials, it comes without warning.

The wonderful flocks of wild pigeons had arrived. For a few days in May they were there in
millions, swarming over the ground in long-reaching hordes, walking along, pecking and feeding,
the rearmost flying on ahead, ever to the front. The food they sought so eagerly now was chiefly
the seeds of the slippery elm, tiny nuts showered down on wings like broad-brimmed hats. And
when the flock arose at some alarm, the sound was like that of the sea beach in a storm.

There seemed to be most pigeons in the low country southeast of the lake, of course, because,
being low, it had most elms. So Rolf took his bow and arrows, crossed in the canoe, and confidently
set about gathering in a dozen or two for broilers.

It is amazing how well the game seems to gauge the range of your weapon and keep the exact
safe distance. It is marvellous how many times you may shoot an arrow into a flock of pigeons
and never kill one. Rolf went on and on, always in sight of the long, straggling flocks on
the ground or in the air, but rarely within range of them. Again and again he fired a random
shot into the distant mass, without success for two hours. Finally a pigeon was touched and
dropped, but it rose as he ran forward, and flew ten yards, to drop once more. Again he rushed
at it, but it fluttered out of reach and so led him on and on for about half an hour's breathless
race, until at last he stopped, took deliberate aim, and killed it with an arrow.

Now a peculiar wailing and squealing from the woods far ahead attracted him. He stalked and
crawled for many minutes before he found out, as he should have known, that it was caused by
a mischievous bluejay.

At length he came to a spring in a low hollow, and leaving his bow and arrows on a dry log,
he went down to get a drink.

As he arose, he found himself face to face with a doe and a fat, little yearling buck, only
twenty yards away. They stared at him, quite unalarmed, and, determining to add the yearling
to his bag, Rolf went back quietly to his bow and arrows.

The deer were just out of range now, but inclined to take a curious interest in the hunter.
Once when he stood still for a long time, they walked forward two or three steps; but whenever
he advanced, they trotted farther away.

To kill a deer with an arrow is quite a feat of woodcraft, and Rolf was keen to show his prowess;
so he kept on with varying devices, and was continually within sight of the success that did
not actually arrive.

Then the deer grew wilder and loped away, as he entered another valley that was alive with pigeons.

He was feeling hungry now, so he plucked the pigeon he had secured, made a fire with the flint
and steel he always carried, then roasted the bird carefully on a stick, and having eaten it,
felt ready for more travel.

The day was cloudy, so he could not see the sun; but he knew it was late, and he made for camp.

The country he found himself in was entirely strange to him, and the sun's whereabouts doubtful;
but he knew the general line of travel and strode along rapidly toward the place where he had
left the canoe.

After two hours' tramping, he was surprised at not seeing the lake through the trees, and he
added to his pace.

Three hours passed and still no sign of the water.

He began to think he had struck too far to the north; so corrected his course and strode along
with occasional spells of trotting. But another hour wore away and no lake appeared.

Then Rolf knew he was off his bearings. He climbed a tree and got a partial view of the country.
To the right was a small hill. He made for that. The course led him through a hollow. In this
he recognized two huge basswood trees, that gave him a reassuring sense. A little farther he
came on a spring, strangely like the one he had left some hours ago. As he stooped to drink,
he saw deer tracks, then a human track. He studied it. Assuredly it was his own track, though
now it seemed on the south side instead of the north. He stared at the dead gray sky, hoping
for sign of sun, but it gave no hint. He tramped off hastily toward the hill that promised
a lookout. He went faster and faster. In half an hour the woods opened a little, then dipped.
He hastened down, and at the bottom found himself standing by the same old spring, though again
it had changed its north bearing.

He was stunned by this succession of blows. He knew now he was lost in the woods; had been
tramping in a circle.

The spring whirled around him; it seemed now north and now south. His first impulse was to
rush madly northwesterly, as he understood it. He looked at all the trees for guidance. Most
moss should be on the north side. It would be so, if all trees were perfectly straight and
evenly exposed, but alas! none are so. All lean one way or another, and by the moss he could
prove any given side to be north. He looked for the hemlock top twigs. Tradition says they
always point easterly; but now they differed among themselves as to which was east.

Rolf got more and more worried. He was a brave boy, but grim fear came into his mind as he
realized that he was too far from camp to be heard; the ground was too leafy for trailing him;
without help he could not get away from that awful spring. His head began to swim, when all
at once he remembered a bit of advice his guide had given him long ago: "Don't get scared when
you're lost. Hunger don't kill the lost man, and it ain't cold that does it; it's being afraid.
Don't be afraid, and everything will come out all right."

So, instead of running, Rolf sat down to think it over.

"Now," said he, "I went due southeast all day from the canoe." Then he stopped; like a shock
it came to him that he had not seen the sun all day. Had he really gone southeast? It was a
devastating thought, enough to unhinge some men; but again Rolf said to himself "Never mind,
now; don't get scared, and it'll be all right. In the morning the sky will be clear."

As he sat pondering, a red squirrel chippered and scolded from a near tree; closer and closer
the impudent creature came to sputter at the intruder.

Rolf drew his bow, and when the blunt arrow dropped to the ground, there also dropped the red
squirrel, turned into acceptable meat. Rolf put this small game into his pocket, realizing
that this was his supper.

It would soon be dark now, so he prepared to spend the night.

While yet he could see, he gathered a pile of dry wood into a sheltered hollow. Then he made
a wind-break and a bed of balsam boughs. Flint, steel, tinder, and birch bark soon created
a cheerful fire, and there is no better comforter that the lone lost man can command.

The squirrel roasted in its hide proved a passable supper, and Rolf curled up to sleep. The
night would have been pleasant and uneventful, but that it turned chilly, and when the fire
burnt low, the cold awakened him, so he had a succession of naps and fire-buildings.

Soon after dawn, he heard a tremendous roaring, and in a few minutes the wood was filled again
with pigeons.

Rolf was living on the country now, so he sallied forth with his bow. Luck was with him; at
the first shot he downed a big, fat cock. At the second he winged another, and as it scrambled
through the brush, he rushed headlong in pursuit. It fluttered away beyond reach, half-flying,
half-running, and Rolf, in reckless pursuit, went sliding and tumbling down a bank to land
at the bottom with a horrid jar. One leg was twisted under him; he thought it was broken, for
there was a fearful pain in the lower part. But when he pulled himself together he found no
broken bones, indeed, but an ankle badly sprained. Now his situation was truly grave, for he
was crippled and incapable of travelling.

He had secured the second bird, and crawling painfully and slowly back to the fire, he could
not but feel more and more despondent and gloomy as the measure of his misfortune was realized.

"There is only one thing that can shame a man, that is to be afraid." And again, "There's always
a way out." These were the sayings that came ringing through his head to his heart; one was
from Quonab, the other from old Sylvanne. Yes, there's always a way, and the stout heart can
always find it.

Rolf prepared and cooked the two birds, made a breakfast of one and put the other in his pocket
for lunch, not realizing at the time that his lunch would be eaten on this same spot. More
than once, as he sat, small flocks of ducks flew over the trees due northward. At length the
sky, now clear, was ablaze with the rising sun, and when it came, it was in Rolf's western sky.

Now he comprehended the duck flight. They were really heading southeast for their feeding grounds
on the Indian Lake, and Rolf, had he been able to tramp, could have followed, but his foot
was growing worse. It was badly swollen, and not likely to be of service for many a day--perhaps
weeks--and it took all of his fortitude not to lie down and weep over this last misfortune.

Again came the figure of that grim, kindly, strong old pioneer, with the gray-blue eyes and
his voice was saying: "Jest when things looks about as black as they can look, if ye hold steady,
keep cool and kind, something sure happens to make it all easy. There's always a way and the
stout heart will find it."

What way was there for him? He would die of hunger and cold before Quonab could find him, and
again came the spectre of fear. If only he could devise some way of letting his comrade know.
He shouted once or twice, in the faint hope that the still air might carry the sound, but the
silent wood was silent when he ceased.

Then one of his talks with Quonab came to mind. He remembered how the Indian, as a little papoose,
had been lost for three days. Though, then but ten years old, he had built a smoke fire that
brought him help. Yes, that was the Indian way; two smokes means "I am lost"; "double for trouble."

Fired by this new hope, Rolf crawled a little apart from his camp and built a bright fire,
then smothered it with rotten wood and green leaves. The column of smoke it sent up was densely
white and towered above the trees.

Then painfully he hobbled and crawled to a place one hundred yards away, and made another smoke.
Now all he could do was wait.

A fat pigeon, strayed from its dock, sat on a bough above his camp, in a way to tempt Providence.
Rolf drew a blunt arrow to the head and speedily had the pigeon in hand for some future meal.

As he prepared it, he noticed that its crop was crammed with the winged seed of the slippery
elm, so he put them all back again into the body when it was cleaned, knowing well that they
are a delicious food and in this case would furnish a welcome variant to the bird itself.

An hour crawled by. Rolf had to go out to the far fire, for it was nearly dead. Instinctively
he sought a stout stick to help him; then remembered how Hoag had managed with one leg and
two crutches. "Ho!" he exclaimed. "That is the answer--this is the 'way."'

Now his attention was fixed on all the possible crutches. The trees seemed full of them, but
all at impossible heights. It was long before he found one that he could cut with his knife.
Certainly he was an hour working at it; then he heard a sound that made his blood jump.

From far away in the north it came, faint but reaching;

"Ye-hoo-o."

Rolf dropped his knife and listened with the instinctively open mouth that takes all pressure
from the eardrums and makes them keen. It came again: "Ye-hoo-o." No mistake now, and Rolf
sent the ringing answer back:

"Ye-hoo-o, ye-hoo-o."

In ten minutes there was a sharp "yap, yap," and Skookum bounded out of the woods to leap and
bark around Rolf, as though he knew all about it; while a few minutes later, came Quonab striding.

"Ho, boy," he said, with a quiet smile, and took Rolf's hand. "Ugh! That was good," and he
nodded to the smoke fire. "I knew you were in trouble."

"Yes," and Rolf pointed to the swollen ankle.

The Indian picked up the lad in his arms and carried him back to the little camp. Then, from
his light pack, he took bread and tea and made a meal for both. And, as they ate, each heard
the other's tale.

"I was troubled when you did not come back last night, for you had no food or blanket. I did
not sleep. At dawn I went to the hill, where I pray, and looked away southeast where you went
in the canoe. I saw nothing. Then I went to a higher hill, where I could see the northeast,
and even while I watched, I saw the two smokes, so I knew my son was alive."

"You mean to tell me I am northeast of camp?"

"About four miles. I did not come very quickly, because I had to go for the canoe and travel here.

"How do you mean by canoe?" said Rolf, in surprise.

"You are only half a mile from Jesup River," was the reply. "I soon bring you home."

It was incredible at first, but easy of proof. With the hatchet they made a couple of serviceable
crutches and set out together.

In twenty minutes they were afloat in the canoe; in an hour they were safely home again.

And Rolf pondered it not a little. At the very moment of blackest despair, the way had opened,
and it had been so simple, so natural, so effectual. Surely, as long as he lived, he would
remember it. "There is always a way, and the stout heart will find it."

Chapter 50. Marketing the Fur

If Rolf had been at home with his mother, she would have rubbed his black and swollen ankle
with goose grease. The medical man at Stamford would have rubbed it with a carefully prepared
and secret ointment. His Indian friend sang a little crooning song and rubbed it with deer's
fat. All different, and all good, because each did something to reassure the patient, to prove
that big things were doing on his behalf, and each helped the process of nature by frequent
massage.

Three times a day, Quonab rubbed that blackened ankle. The grease saved the skin from injury,
and in a week Rolf had thrown his crutches away.

The month of May was nearly gone; June was at hand; that is, the spring was over.

In all ages, man has had the impulse, if not the habit, of spring migration. Yielding to it
he either migrated or made some radical change in his life. Most of the Adirondack men who
trapped in the winter sought work on the log drives in spring; some who had families and a
permanent home set about planting potatoes and plying the fish nets. Rolf and Quonab having
neither way open, yet feeling the impulse, decided to go out to Warren's with the fur.

Quonab wanted tobacco--and a change.

Rolf wanted a rifle, and to see the Van Trumpers--and a change.

So June 1st saw them all aboard, with Quonab steering at the stern, and Skookum bow-wowing
at the bow, bound for the great centre of Warren's settlement--one store and three houses,
very wide apart.

There was a noble flush of water in the streams, and, thanks to their axe work in September,
they passed down Jesup's River without a pause, and camped on the Hudson that night, fully
twenty-five miles from home.

Long, stringing flocks of pigeons going north were the most numerous forms of life. But a porcupine
on the bank and a bear in the water aroused Skookum to a pitch of frightful enthusiasm and
vaulting ambition that he was forced to restrain.

On the evening of the third day they landed at Warren's and found a hearty welcome from the
trader, who left a group of loafers and came forward:

"Good day to ye, boy. My, how ye have growed."

So he had. Neither Rolf nor Quonab had remarked it, but now they were much of the same height.
"Wall, an' how'd ye make out with yer hunt?--Ah, that's fine!" as each of them dropped a fur
pack on the counter. "Wall, this is fine; we must have a drink on the head of it," and the
trader was somewhat nonplussed when both the trappers refused. He was disappointed, too, for
that refusal meant that they would get much better prices for their fun But he concealed his
chagrin and rattled on: "I reckon I'll sell you the finest rifle in the country this time,"
and he knew by Rolf's face that there was business to do in that line.

Now came the listing of the fur, and naturally the bargaining was between the shrewd Yankee
boy and the trader. The Indian stood shyly aside, but he did not fail to help with significant
grunts and glances.

"There, now," said Warren, as the row of martens were laid out side by side, "thirty martens--a
leetle pale--worth three dollars and fifty cents each, or, to be generous, we'll say four dollars."
Rolf glanced at Quonab, who, unseen by the trader shook his head, held his right hand out,
open hollow up, then raised it with a jerk for two inches.

Quickly Rolf caught the idea and said; "No, I don't reckon them pale. I call them prime dark,
every one of them." Quonab spread his hand with all five fingers pointed up, and Rolf continued,
"They are worth five dollars each, if they're worth a copper."

"Phew!" said the trader. "you forget fur is an awful risky thing; what with mildew, moth, mice,
and markets, we have a lot of risk. But I want to please you, so let her go; five each. There's
a fine black fox; that's worth forty dollars."

"I should think it is," said Rolf, as Quonab, by throwing to his right an imaginary pinch of
sand, made the sign "refuse."

They had talked over the value of that fox skin and Rolf said, "Why, I know of a black fox
that sold for two hundred dollars."

"Where?"

"Oh, down at Stamford."

"Why, that's near New York."

"Of course; don't you send your fur to New York?"

"Yes, but it costs a lot to get it there.

"Now," said Warren, "if you'll take it in trade, I'll meet you half-way and call it one hundred
dollars."

"Make it one hundred and twenty-five dollars and I'll take a rifle, anyway."

"Phew!" whistled the trader. "Where do ye get such notions?"

"Nothing wrong about the notion; old Si Sylvanne offered me pretty near that, if I'd come out
his way with the stuff."

This had the desired effect of showing that there were other traders. At last the deal was
closed. Besides the fox skin, they had three hundred dollars' worth of fur. The exchange for
the fox skin was enough to buy all the groceries and dry goods they needed. But Rolf had something
else in mind.

He had picked out some packages of candies, some calico prints and certain bright ribbons,
when the trader grasped the idea. "I see; yer goin' visitin'. Who is it? Must be the Van Trumpers!"

Rolf nodded and now he got some very intelligent guidance. He did not buy Annette's dress,
because part of her joy was to be the expedition in person to pick it out; but he stocked up
with some gorgeous pieces of jewellery that were ten cents each, and ribbons whose colours
were as far beyond expression as were the joys they could create in the backwoods female heart.

Proudly clutching his new rlile, and carrying in his wallet a memorandum of three hundred dollars
for their joint credit, Rolf felt himself a person of no little importance. As he was stepping
out of the store, the trader said, "Ye didn't run across Jack Hoag agin, did ye?"

"Did we? Hmph!" and Rolf told briefly of their experience with that creature.

"Just like him, just like him; served him right; he was a dirty cuss. But, say; don't you be
led into taking your fur out Lyons Falls way. They're a mean lot in there, and it stands to
reason I can give you better prices, being a hundred miles nearer New York."

And that lesson was not forgotten. The nearer New York the better the price; seventy-five dollars
at Lyons Falls; one hundred and twenty-five dollars at Warren's; two hundred dollars at New
York. Rolf pondered long and the idea was one which grew and bore fruit.

Chapter 51. Back at Van Trumper's

"Nibowaka"--Quonab always said "Nibowaka" when he was impressed with Rolf's astuteness--"What
about the canoe and stuff?"

"I think we better leave all here. Callan will lend us a canoe." So they shouldered the guns,
Rolf clung to his, and tramped across the portage, reaching Callan's in less than two hours.

"Why, certainly you can have the canoe, but come in and eat first," was the kindly backwoods
greeting. However, Rolf was keen to push on; they launched the canoe at once and speedily were
flashing their paddles on the lake.

The place looked sweetly familiar as they drew near. The crops in the fields were fair; the
crop of chickens at the barn was good; and the crop of children about the door was excellent.

"Mein Hemel! mein Hemel!" shouted fat old Hendrik, as they walked up to the stable door. In
a minute he was wringing their hands and smiling into great red, white, and blue smiles. "Coom
in, coom in, lad. Hi, Marta, here be Rolf and Quonab. Mein Hemel! mein Hemel! what am I now
so happy."

"Where's Annette?" asked Rolf.

"Ach, poor Annette, she fever have a little; not mooch, some," and he led over to a corner
where on a low cot lay Annette, thin, pale, and listless.

She smiled faintly, in response, when Rolf stooped and kissed her.

"Why, Annette, I came back to see you. I want to take you over to Warren's store, so you can
pick out that dress. See, I brought you my first marten and I made this box for you; you must
thank Skookum for the quills on it."

"Poor chile; she bin sick all spring," and Marta used a bunch of sedge to drive away the flies
and mosquitoes that, bass and treble, hovered around the child.

"What ails her?" asked Rolf anxiously.

"Dot ve do not know," was the reply.

"Maybe there's some one here can tell," and Roll glanced at the Indian.

"Ach, sure! Have I you that not always told all-vays--eet is so. All-vays, I want sumpin bad
mooch. I prays de good Lord and all-vays, all-vays, two times now, He it send by next boat.
Ach, how I am spoil," and the good Dutchman's eyes filled with tears of thankfulness.

Quonab knelt by the sufferer. He felt her hot, dry hand; he noticed her short, quick breathing,
her bright eyes, and the untouched bowl of mush by her bed.

"Swamp fever," he said. "I bring good medicine." He passed quietly out into the woods. When
he returned, he carried a bundle of snake-root which he made into tea.

Annette did not wish to touch it, but her mother persuaded her to take a few sips from a cup
held by Rolf.

"Wah! this not good," and Quonab glanced about the close, fly-infested room. "I must make lodge."
He turned up the cover of the bedding; three or four large, fiat brown things moved slowly
out of the light. "Yes, I make lodge."

It was night now, and all retired; the newcomers to the barn. They had scarcely entered, when
a screaming of poultry gave a familiar turn to affairs. On running to the spot, it proved not
a mink or coon, but Skookum, up to his old tricks. On the appearance of his masters, he fled
with guilty haste, crouched beneath the post that he used to be, and soon again was, chained to.

In the morning Quonab set about his lodge, and Rolf said: "I've got to go to Warren's for sugar."
The sugar was part truth and part blind. As soon as he heard the name swamp fever, Rolf remembered
that, in Redding, Jesuit's bark (known later as quinine) was the sovereign remedy. He had seen
his mother administer it many times, and, so far as he knew, with uniform success. Every frontier
(or backwoods, it's the same) trader carries a stock of medicine, and in two hours Rolf left
Warren's counter with twenty-five pounds of maple sugar and a bottle of quinine extract in
his pack.

"You say she's bothered with the flies; why don't you take some of this new stuff for a curtain?"
and the trader held up a web of mosquito gauze, the first Rolf had seen. That surely was a
good idea, and ten yards snipped off was a most interesting addition to his pack. The amount
was charged against him, and in two hours more he was back at Van Trumper's.

On the cool side of the house, Quonab had built a little lodge, using a sheet for cover. On
a low bed of pine boughs lay the child. Near the door was a smouldering fire of cedar, whose
aromatic fumes on the lazy wind reached every cranny of the lodge.

Sitting by the bed head, with a chicken wing to keep off the few mosquitoes, was the Indian.
The child's eyes were closed; she was sleeping peacefully. Rolf crept gently forward, laid
his hand on hers, it was cool and moist. He went into the house with his purchases; the mother
greeted him with a happy look: Yes, Annette was a little better; she had slept quietly ever
since she was taken outdoors. The mother could not understand. Why should the Indian want to
have her surrounded by pine boughs? why cedar-smoke? and why that queer song? Yes, there it
was again. Rolf went out to see and hear. Softly summing on a tin pan, with a mudded stick,
the Indian sang a song. The words which Rolf learned in the after-time were:

"Come, Kaluskap, drive the witches; Those who came to harm the dear one."

Annette moved not, but softly breathed, as she slept a sweet, restful slumber, the first for
many days.

"Vouldn't she be better in de house?" whispered the anxious mother.

"No, let Quonab do his own way," and Rolf wondered if any white man had sat by little Wee-wees
to brush away the flies from his last bed.

Chapter 52. Annette's New Dress

     Deep feelin's ain't any count by themselves; work 'em off,
     an' ye're somebody; weep 'em off an' you'd be more use with
     a heart o' stone--Sayings of Si Sylvanne.

"Quonab, I am going out to get her a partridge." "Ugh, good."

So Rolf went off. For a moment he was inclined to grant Skookom's prayer for leave to, follow,
but another and better plan came in mind. Skookum would most likely find a mother partridge,
which none should kill in June, and there was a simple way to find a cock; that was, listen.
It was now the evening calm, and before Rolf had gone half a mile he heard the distant "Thump,
thump, thump, thump--rrrrrrr" of a partridge, drumming. He went quickly and cautiously toward
the place, then waited for the next drumming. It was slow in coming, so he knelt down by a
mossy, rotten log, and struck it with his hands to imitate the thump and roll of the partridge.
At once this challenge procured response.

"Thump--thump--thump,, thump rrrrrrrrrrrr" it came, with martial swing and fervour, and crawling
nearer, Rolf spied the drummer, pompously strutting up and down a log some forty yards away.
He took steady aim, not for the head--a strange gun, at forty yards--for the body. At the crack,
the bird fell dead, and in Rolf's heart there swelled up a little gush of joy, which he believed
was all for the sake of the invalid, but which a finer analysis might have proved to be due
quite as much to pride in himself and his newly bought gun.

Night was coming on when he got back, and he found the Dutch parents in some excitement. "Dot
Indian he gay no bring Annette indoors for de night. How she sleep outdoors--like dog--like
Bigger--like tramp? Yah it is bad, ain't it?" and poor old Hendrik looked sadly upset and mystified.

"Hendrik, do you suppose God turns out worse air in the night than in the day?"

"Ach, dunno."

"Well, you see Quonab knows what he's doing."

"Yah."

"Well, let him do it. He or I'll sleep alongside the child she'll be all right," and Rolf thought
of those horrible brown crawlers under the bedding indoors.

Rolf had much confidence in the Indian as a doctor, but he had more in his own mother. He was
determined to give Annette the quinine, yet he hesitated to interfere. At length, he said:
"It is cool enough now; I will put these thin curtains round her bed."

"Ugh, good!" but the red man sat there while it was being done.

"You need not stay now; I'll watch her, Quonab."

"Soon, give more medicine," was the reply that Rolf did not want. So he changed his ruse. "I
wish you'd take that partridge and make soup of it. I've had my hands in poison ivy, so I dare
not touch it."

"Ach, dot shall I do. Dot kin myself do," and the fat mother, laying the recent baby in its
cradle, made cumbrous haste to cook the bird.

"Foiled again," was Rolf's thought, but his Yankee wit was with him. He laid one hand on the
bowl of snake-root tea. It was lukewarm. "Do you give it hot or cold, Quonab?"

"Hot."

"I'll take it in and heat it." He carried it off, thinking, "If Quonab won't let me give the
bark extract, I'll make him give it." In the gloom of the kitchen he had no difficulty in adding
to the tea, quite unseen, a quarter of the extract; when heated, he brought it again, and the
Indian himself gave the dose.

As bedtime drew near, and she heard the red man say he would sleep there, the little one said
feebly, "Mother, mother," then whispered in her mother's ear, "I want Rolf."

Rolf spread his blanket by the cot and slept lightly. Once or twice he rose to look at Annette.
She was moving in her sleep, but did not awake. He saw to it that the mosquito bar was in place,
and slept till morning.

There was no question that the child was better. The renewed interest in food was the first
good symptom, and the partridge served the end of its creation. The snakeroot and the quinine
did noble work, and thenceforth her recovery was rapid. It was natural for her mother to wish
the child back indoors. It was a matter of course that she should go. It was accepted as an
unavoidable evil that they should always have those brown crawlers about the bed.

But Rolf felt differently. He knew what his mother would have thought and done. It meant another
visit to Warren's, and the remedy he brought was a strong-smelling oil, called in those days
"rock oil"--a crude petroleum. When all cracks in the bed and near wall were treated with this,
it greatly mitigated, if it did not quite end, the nuisance of the "plague that walks in the dark."

Meanwhile, Quonab had made good his welcome by working on the farm. But when a week had flown,
he showed signs of restlessness. "We have enough money, Nibowaka, why do we stay?"

Rolf was hauling a bucket of water from the well at the time. He stopped with his burden on
the well-sweep, gazed into the well, and said slowly: "I don't know." If the truth were set
forth, it would be that this was the only home circle he knew. It was the clan feeling that
held him, and soon it was clearly the same reason that was driving Quonab to roam.

"I have heard," said the Indian, "that my people still dwell in Canada, beyond Rouse's Point.
I would see them. I will come again in the Red Moon (August)."

So they hired a small canoe, and one bright morning, with Skookum in the bow, Quonab paddled
away on his voyage of 120 miles on the plead waters of Lakes George and Champlain. His canoe
became a dark spot on the water; slowly it faded till only the flashing paddle was seen, and
that was lost around a headland.

The next day Rolf was sorry he let Quonab go alone, for it was evident that Van Trumper needed
no help for a month yet; that is, he could not afford to hire, and while it was well enough
for Rolf to stay a few days and work to equalize his board, the arrangement would not long
continue satisfactory to both.

Yet there was one thing he must do before leaving, take Annette to pick out her dress. She
was well again now, and they set off one morning in the canoe, she and Rolf. Neither father
nor mother could leave the house. They had their misgivings, but what could they do? She was
bright and happy, full of the childish joy that belongs to that age, and engaged on such an
important errand for the first time in her life.

There was something more than childish joy showing in her face, an older person would have
seen that, but it was largely lost on Rolf. There was a tendency to blush when she laughed,
a disposition to tease her "big brother," to tyrannize over him in little things.

"Now, you tell me some more about 'Robinson Crusoe,'" she began, as soon as they were in the
canoe, and Rolf resumed the ancient, inspiring tale to have it listened to eagerly, but criticized
from the standpoint of a Lake George farm. "Where was his wife?" "How could he have a farm
without hens?" "Dried grapes must be nice, but I'd rather have pork than goat," etc.

Rolf, of course, took the part of Robinson Crusoe, and it gave him a little shock to hear Quonab
called his man Friday.

At the west side they were to invite Mrs. Callan to join their shopping trip, but in any case
they were to borrow a horse and buckboard. Neither Mrs. Callan nor the buckboard was available,
but they were welcome to the horse. So Annette was made comfortable on a bundle of blankets,
and chattered incessantly while Rolf walked alongside with the grave interest and superiority
of a much older brother. So they crossed the five-mile portage and came to Warren's store.
Nervous and excited, with sparkling eyes, Annette laid down her marten skin, received five
dollars, and set about the tremendous task of selecting her first dress of really, truly calico
print; and Rolf realized that the joy he had found in his new rifle was a very small affair,
compared with the epoch-making, soul-filling, life-absorbing, unspeakable, and cataclysmal
bliss that a small girl can have in her first chance of unfettered action in choice of a cotton
print.

"Beautiful?" How can mere words do justice to masses of yellow corn, mixed recklessly with
green and scarlet poppies on a bright blue ground. No, you should have seen Annette's dress,
or you cannot expect to get the adequate thrill. And when they found that there was enough
cash left over to add a red cotton parasol to the glorious spoils, every one there beamed in
a sort of friendly joy, and the trader, carried away by the emotions of the hour, contributed
a set of buttons of shining brass.

Warren kept a "meal house," which phrase was a ruse that saved him from a burdensome hospitality.
Determined to do it all in the best style, Rolf took Annette to the meal-house table. She was
deeply awed by the grandeur of a tablecloth and white plates, but every one was kind.

Warren, talking to a stranger opposite, and evidently resuming a subject they had discussed, said:

"Yes, I'd like to send the hull lot down to Albany this week, if I could get another man for
the canoe."

Rolf was interested at once and said: "What wages are you offering?"

"Twenty-five dollars and board."

"How will I do?"

"Well," said Warren, as though thinking it over: "I dunno but ye would. Could ye go to-morrow?"

"Yes, indeed, for one month."

"All right, it's a bargain."

And so Rolf took the plunge that influenced his whole life.

But Annette whispered gleefully and excitedly, "May I have some of that, and that?" pointing
to every strange food she could see, and got them all.

After noon they set out on their return journey, Annette clutching her prizes, and prattling
incessantly, while Rolf walked alongside, thinking deeply, replying to her chatter, but depressed
by the thought of good-bye tomorrow. He was aroused at length by a scraping sound overhead
and a sharp reprimand, "Rolf, you'll tear my new parasol, if you don't lead the horse better."

By two o'clock they were at Callan's. Another hour and they had crossed the lake, and Annette,
shrill with joy, was displaying her treasures to the wonder and envy of her kin.

Making a dress was a simple matter in those and Marta promised: "Yah, soom day ven I one have,
shall I it sew." Meanwhile, Annette was quaffing deep, soul-satisfying draughts in the mere
contempt of the yellow, red, green, and blue glories in which was soon to appear in public.
And when the bed came, she fell asleep holding the dress-goods stuff in arms, and with the
red parasol spread above her head, tired out, but inexpressibly happy.

Chapter 53. Travelling to the Great City

     He's a bad failure that ain't king in some little corner.
     --Sayings of Sylvanne Sylvanne

The children were not astir when Rolf was off in the morning. He caught a glimpse of Annette,
still asleep under the red parasol, but the dress goods and the brass buttons had fallen to
the floor. He stepped into the canoe. The dead calm of early morning was on the water, and
the little craft went skimming and wimpling across. In half an hour it was beached at Callan's.
In a little more than an hour's jog and stride he was at Warren's, ready for work. As he marched
in, strong and brisk, his colour up, his blue eyes kindled with the thought of seeing Albany,
the trader could not help being struck by him, especially when he remembered each of their
meetings--meetings in which he discerned a keen, young mind of good judgment, one that could
decide quickly.

Gazing at the lithe, red-checked lad, he said: "Say, Rolf, air ye an Injun??"

"No, sir."

"Air ye a half-breed?"

"No, I'm a Yank; my name is Kittering; born and bred in Redding, Connecticut."

"Well, I swan, ye look it. At fust I took ye fur an Injun; ye did look dark (and Rolf laughed
inside, as he thought of that butternut dye), but I'm bound to say we're glad yer white."

"Here, Bill, this is Rolf, Rolf Kittering, he'll go with ye to Albany." Bill, a loose-jointed,
middle-aged, flat-footed, large-handed, semi-loafer, with keen gray eyes, looked up from a
bundle he was roping.

Then Warren took Rolf aside and explained: "I'm sending down all my fur this trip. There's
ten bales of sixty pounds each, pretty near my hull fortune. I want it took straight to Vandam's,
and, night or day, don't leave it till ye git it there. He's close to the dock. I'm telling
ye this for two reasons: The river's swarming with pirates and sneaks. They'd like nothing
better than to get away with a five-hundred-dollar bundle of fur; and, next, while Bill is
A1 on the river and true as steel, he's awful weak on the liquor; goes crazy, once it's in
him. And I notice you've always refused it here. So don't stop at Troy, an' when ye get to
Albany go straight past there to Vandam's. You'll have a letter that'll explain, and he'll
supply the goods yer to bring back. He's a sort of a partner, and orders from him is same as
from me.

"I suppose I ought to go myself, but this is the time all the fur is coming in here, an' I
must be on hand to do the dickering, and there's too much much to risk it any longer in the
storehouse."

"Suppose," said Rolf, "Bill wants to stop at Troy?"

"He won't. He's all right, given he's sober. I've give him the letter."

"Couldn't you give me the letter, in case?"

"Law, Bill'd get mad and quit."

"He'll never know."

"That's so; I will." So when they paddled away, Bill had an important letter of instructions
ostentatiously tucked in his outer pocket. Rolf, unknown to any one else but Warren, had a
duplicate, wrapped in waterproof, hidden in an inside pocket.

Bill was A1 on the river; a kind and gentle old woodman, much stronger than he looked. He knew
the value of fur and the danger of wetting it, so he took no chances in doubtful rapids. This
meant many portages and much hard labour.

I wonder if the world realizes the hard labour of the portage or carry? Let any man who seeks
for light, take a fifty-pound sack of flour on his shoulders and walk a quarter of a mile on
level ground in cool weather. Unless he is in training, he will find it a heavy burden long
before he is half-way. Suppose, instead of a flour sack, the burden has sharp angles; the bearer
is soon in torture. Suppose the weight carried be double; then the strain is far more than
doubled. Suppose, finally, the road be not a quarter mile but a mile, and not on level but
through swamps, over rocks, logs, and roots, and the weather not cool, but suffocating summer
weather in the woods, with mosquitoes boring into every exposed part, while both hands are
occupied, steadying the burden or holding on to branches for help up steep places--and then
he will have some idea of the horror of the portage; and there were many of these, each one
calling for six loaded and five light trips for each canoe-man. What wonder that men will often
take chances in some fierce rapid, rather than to make a long carry through the fly-infested woods.

It was weighty evidence of Bill's fidelity that again and again they made a portage around
rapids he had often run, because in the present case he was in sacred trust of that much prized
commodity--fur.

Eighty miles they called it from Warren's to Albany, but there were many halts and carries
which meant long delay, and a whole week was covered before Bill and Rolf had passed the settlements
of Glens Falls, Fort Edward, and Schuylerville, and guided their heavily laden canoe on the
tranquil river, past the little town of Troy. Loafers hailed them from the bank, but Bill turned
a deaf ear to all temptation; and they pushed on happy in the thought that now their troubles
were over; the last rapid was past; the broad, smooth waters extended to their port.

Chapter 54. Albany

Only a man who in his youth has come at last in sight of some great city he had dreamed of
all his life and longed to see, can enter into Rolf's feelings as they swept around the big
bend, and Albany--Albany, hove in view. Albany, the first chartered city of the United States;
Albany, the capital of all the Empire State; Albany, the thriving metropolis with nearly six
thousand living human souls; Albany with its State House, beautiful and dignified, looking
down the mighty Hudson highway that led to the open sea.

Rolf knew his Bible, and now he somewhat realized the feelings of St. Paul on that historic
day when his life-long dream came true, when first he neared the Eternal City--when at last
he glimpsed the towers of imperial, splendid Rome.

The long-strung docks were massed and webbed with ship rigging; the water was livened with
boats and canoes; the wooden warehouses back of the docks were overtopped by wooden houses
in tiers, until high above them all the Capitol itself was the fitting climax.

Rolf knew something of shipping, and amid all the massed boats his eyes fell on a strange,
square-looking craft with a huge water-wheel on each side. Then, swinging into better view,
he read her name, the Clermont, and knew that this was the famous Fulton steamer, the first
of the steamboat age.

But Bill was swamped by no such emotion. Albany, Hudson, Clermont, and all, were familiar stories
to him and he stolidly headed the canoe for the dock he knew of old.

Loafers roosting on the snubbing posts hailed him, at first with raillery; but, coming nearer,
he was recognized. "Hello, Bill; back again? Glad to see you," and there was superabundant
help to land the canoe.

"Wall, wall, wall, so it's really you," said the touter of a fur house, in extremely friendly
voice; "come in now and we'll hev a drink."

"No, sir-ree," said Bill decisively, "I don't drink till business is done."

"Wall, now, Bill, here's Van Roost's not ten steps away an' he hez tapped the finest bar'l
in years."

"No, I tell ye, I'm not drinking--now."

"Wall, all right, ye know yer own business. I thought maybe ye'd be glad to see us."

"Well, ain't I?"

"Hello, Bill," and Bill's fat brother-in-law came up. "Thus does me good, an' yer sister is
spilin' to see ye. We'll hev one on this."

"No, Sam, I ain't drinkin'; I've got biz to tend."

"Wall, hev just one to clear yer head. Then settle yer business and come back to us."

So Bill went to have one to clear his head. "I'll be back in two minutes, Rolf," but Rolf saw
him no more for many days.

"You better come along, cub," called out a red-nosed member of the group. But Rolf shook his head.

"Here, I'll help you git them ashore," volunteered an effusive stranger, with one eye.

"I don't want help."

"How are ye gain' to handle 'em alone?"

"Well, there's one thing I'd be glad to have ye do; that is, go up there and bring Peter Vandam."

"I'll watch yer stuff while you go."

"No, I can't leave." "Then go to blazes; d'yte take me for yer errand boy?" And Rolf was left
alone.

He was green at the business, but already he was realizing the power of that word fur and the
importance of the peltry trade. Fur was the one valued product of the wilderness that only
the hunter could bring. The merchants of the world were as greedy for fur as for gold, and
far more so than for precious stones.

It was a commodity so light that, even in those days, a hundred weight of fur might range in
value from one hundred to five thousand dollars, so that a man with a pack of fine furs was
a capitalist. The profits of the business were good for trapper, very large for the trader,
who doubled his first gain by paying in trade; but they were huge for the Albany middleman,
and colossal for the New Yorker who shipped to London.

With such allurements, it was small wonder that more country was explored and opened for fur
than for settlement or even for gold; and there were more serious crimes and high-handed robberies
over the right to trade a few furs than over any other legitimate business. These things were
new to Rolf within the year, but he was learning the lesson, and Warren's remarks about fur
stuck in his memory with growing value. Every incident since the trip began had given them
new points.

The morning passed without sign of Bill; so, when in the afternoon, some bare-legged boys came
along, Rolf said to them: "Do any of ye know where Peter Vandam's house is?"

"Yeh, that's it right there," and they pointed to a large log house less than a hundred yards away.

"Do ye know him?"

"Yeh, he's my paw," said a sun-bleached freckle-face.

"If you bring him here right away, I'll give you a dime. Tell him I'm from Warren's with a cargo."

The dusty stampede that followed was like that of a mustang herd, for a dime was a dime in
those days. And very soon, a tall, ruddy man appeared at the dock. He was a Dutchman in name
only. At first sight he was much like the other loafers, but was bigger, and had a more business-like
air when observed near at hand.

"Are you from Warren's?"

"Yes, sir."

"Alone?"

"No, sir. I came with Bill Bymus. But he went off early this morning; I haven't seen him since.
I'm afraid he's in trouble."

"Where'd he go?"

"In there with some friends."

"Ha, just like him; he's in trouble all right. He'll be no good for a week. Last time he came
near losing all our stuff. Now let's see what ye've got."

"Are you Mr. Peter Vandam?"

"Of course I am."

Still Rolf looked doubtful. There was a small group around, and Rolf heard several voices,
"Yes, this is Peter; ye needn't a-worry." But Rolf knew none of the speakers. His look of puzzlement
at first annoyed then tickled the Dutchman, who exploded into a hearty guffaw.

"Wall, wall, you sure think ill of us. Here, now look at that," and he drew out a bundle of
letters addressed to Master Peter Vandam. Then he displayed a gold watch inscribed on the back
"Peter Vandam"; next he showed a fob seal with a scroll and an inscription, "Petrus Vandamus";
then he turned to a youngster and said, "Run, there is the Reverend Dr. Powellus, he may help
us"; so the black-garbed, knee-breached, shovel-hatted clergyman came and pompously said: "Yes,
my young friend, without doubt you may rest assured that this is our very estimable parishioner,
Master Peter Vandam; a man well accounted in the world of trade."

"And now," said Peter, "with the help of my birth-register and marriage-certificate, which
will be placed at your service with all possible haste, I hope I may win your recognition."
The situation, at first tense, had become more and more funny, and the bystanders laughed aloud.
Rolf rose to it, and smiling said slowly, "I am inclined to think that you must be Master Peter
Vandam, of Albany. If that's so, this letter is for you, also this cargo." And so the delivery
was made.

Bill Bymus has not delivered the other letter to this day. Presumably he went to stay with
his sister, but she saw little of him, for his stay at Albany was, as usual, one long spree.
It was clear that, but for Rolf, there might have been serious loss of fur, and Vandam showed
his appreciation by taking the lad to his own home, where the story of the difficult identification
furnished ground for gusty laughter and primitive jest on many an after day.

The return cargo for Warren consisted of stores that the Vandam warehouse had in stock, and
some stuff that took a day or more to collect in town.

As Rolf was sorting and packing next day, a tall, thin, well-dressed young man walked in with
the air of one much at home.

"Good morrow, Peter."

"Good day to ye, sir," and they talked of crops and politics.

Presently Vandam said, "Rolf, come over here."

He came and was presented to the tall man, who was indeed very thin, and looked little better
than an invalid. "This," said Peter, "is Master Henry van Cortlandt the son of his honour,
the governor, and a very learned barrister. He wants to go on a long hunting trip for his health.
I tell him that likely you are the man he needs."

This was so unexpected that Rolf turned red and gazed on the ground. Van Cortlandt at once
began to clear things by interjecting: "You see, I'm not strong. I want to live outdoors for
three months, where I can have some hunting and be beyond reach of business. I'll pay you a
hundred dollars for the three months, to cover board and guidance. And providing I'm well pleased
and have good hunting, I'll give you fifty dollars more when I get back to Albany."

"I'd like much to be your guide," said Rolf, "but I have a partner. I must find out if he's
willing."

"Ye don't mean-that drunken Bill Bymus?"

"No! my hunting partner; he's an Indian." Then, after a pause, he added, "You wouldn't go in
fly-time, would you?"

"No, I want to be in peace. But any time after the first of August."

"I am bound to help Van Trumper with his harvest; that will take most of August."

As he talked, the young lawyer sized him up and said to himself, "This is my man."

And before they parted it was agreed that Rolf should come to Albany with Quonab as soon as
he could return in August, to form the camping party for the governor's son.

Chapter 55. The Rescue of Bill

Bales were ready and the canoe newly gummed three days after their arrival, but still no sign
of Bill. A messengers sent to the brother-in-law's home reported that he had not been seen
for two days. In spite of the fact that Albany numbered nearly "six thousand living human souls,"
a brief search by the docksharps soon revealed the sinner's retreat. His worst enemy would
have pitied him; a red-eyed wreck; a starved, sick and trembling weakling; conscience-stricken,
for the letter intrusted to him was lost; the cargo stolen--so his comforters had said--and
the raw country lad murdered and thrown out into the river. What wonder that he should shun
the light of day! And when big Peter with Rolf in the living flesh, instead of the sheriff,
stood before him and told him to come out of that and get into the canoe, he wept bitter tears
of repentance and vowed that never, never, never, as long as he lived would he ever again let
liquor touch his lips. A frame of mind which lasted in strength for nearly one day and a half,
and did not entirely varnish for three.

They passed Troy without desiring to stop, and began their fight with the river. It was harder
than when coming, for their course was against stream when paddling, up hill when portaging,
the water was lower, the cargo was heavier, and Bill not so able. Ten days it took them to
cover those eighty miles. But they came out safely, cargo and all, and landed at Warren's alive
and well on the twenty-first day since leaving.

Bill had recovered his usual form. Gravely and with pride he marched up to Warren and handed
out a large letter which read outside, "Bill of Lading," and when opened, read: "The bearer
of this, Bill Bymus, is no good. Don't trust him to Albany any more. (Signed) Peter Vandam."

Warren's eyes twinkled, but he said nothing. He took

Rolf aside and said, "Let's have it." Rolf gave him the real letter that, unknown to Bill,
he had carried, and Warren learned some things that he knew before.

Rolf's contract was for a month; it had ten days to run, and those ten days were put in weighing
sugar, checking accounts, milking cows, and watching the buying of fur. Warren didn't want
him to see too much of the fur business, but Rolf gathered quickly that these were the main
principles: Fill the seller with liquor, if possible; "fire water for fur" was the idea; next,
grade all fur as medium or second-class, when cash was demanded, but be easy as long as payment
was to be in trade. That afforded many loopholes between weighing, grading, charging, and shrinkage,
and finally he noticed that Albany prices were 30 to 50 per cent. higher than Warren prices.
Yet Warren was reckoned a first-class fellow, a good neighbour, and a member of the church.
But it was understood everywhere that fur, like horseflesh, was a business with moral standards
of its own.

A few days before their contract was up, Warren said: "How'd ye like to renew for a month?"

"Can't; I promised to help Van Trumper with his harvest."

"What does he pay ye?"

"Seventy-five cents a day and board."

"I'll make it a dollar."

"I've given my word," said Rolf, in surprise.

"Hey ye signed papers?"

"They're not needed. The only use of signed papers is to show ye have given your word," said
Rolf, quoting his mother, with rising indignation.

The trader sniffed a little contemptuously and said nothing. But he realized the value of a
lad who was a steady, intelligent worker, wouldn't drink, and was absolutely bound by a promise;
so, after awhile, he said: "Wall, if Van don't want ye now, come back for a couple of weeks."

Early in the morning Rolf gathered the trifles he had secured for the little children and the
book he had bought for Annette, a sweet story of a perfect girl who died and went to heaven,
the front embellished with a thrilling wood-cut. Then he crossed the familiar five-mile portage
at a pace that in an hour brought him to the lake.

The greeting at Van's was that of a brother come home.

"Vell, Rolf, it's goood to see ye back. It's choost vat I vented. Hi, Marta, I told it you,
yah. I say, now I hope ze good Gott send Rolf. Ach, how I am shpoil!"

Yes, indeed. The hay was ready; the barley was changing. So Rolf took up his life on the farm,
doing work that a year before was beyond his strength, for the spirit of the hills was on him,
with its impulse of growth, its joy in effort, its glory in strength. And all who saw the longlegged,
long-armed, flat-backed youth plying fork or axe or hoe, in some sort ventured a guess: "He'll
be a good 'un some day; the kind o' chap to keep friendly with.

Chapter 56. The Sick Ox

The Thunder Moon passed quickly by; the hay was in; the barley partly so. Day by day the whitefaced
oxen toiled at the creaking yoke, as the loads of hay and grain were jounced cumbrously over
roots and stumps of the virgin fields. Everything was promising well, when, as usual, there
came a thunderbolt out of the clear sky. Buck, the off ox, fell sick.

Those who know little about cattle have written much of the meek and patient ox. Those who
know them well tell us that the ox is the "most cussedest of all cussed" animals; a sneak,
a bully, a coward, a thief, a shirk, a schemer; and when he is not in mischief he is thinking
about it. The wickedest pack mule that ever bucked his burden is a pinfeathered turtle-dove
compared with an average ox. There are some gentle oxen, but they are rare; most are treacherous,
some are dangerous, and these are best got rid of, as they mislead their yoke mates and mislay
their drivers. Van's two oxen, Buck and Bright, manifested the usual variety and contrariety
of disposition. They were all right when well handled, and this Rolf could do better than Van,
for he was "raised on oxen," and Van's over voluble, sputtering, Dutch-English seemed ill comprehended
of the massive yoke beasts. The simpler whip-waving and fewer orders of the Yankee were so
obviously successful that Van had resigned the whip of authority and Rolf was driver.

Ordinarily, an ox driver walks on the hew (nigh or left) side, near the head of his team, shouting
"gee" (right), "haw" (left), "get up," "steady," or "whoa" (stop), accompanying the order with
a waving of the whip. Foolish drivers lash the oxen on the haw side when they wish them to
gee--and vice versa; but it is notorious that all good drivers do little lashing. Spare the
lash or spoil your team. So it was not long before Rolf could guide them from the top of the
load, as they travelled from shook to shook in the field. This voice of command saved his life,
or at least his limb, one morning, for he made a misstep that tumbled him down between the
oxen and the wagon. At once the team started, but his ringing "Whoa!" brought them to a dead
stop, and saved him; whereas, had it been Van's "Whoa!" it would have set them off at a run,
for every shout from him meant a whip lick to follow.

Thus Rolf won the respect, if not the love, of the huge beasts; more and more they were his
charge, and when, on that sad morning, in the last of the barley, Van came in, "Ach, vot shall
I do! Vot shall I do! Dot Buck ox be nigh dead."

Alas! there he lay on the ground, his head sometimes raised, sometimes stretched out flat,
while the huge creature uttered short moans at times.

Only four years before, Rolf had seen that same thing at Redding. The rolling eye, the working
of the belly muscles, the straining and moaning. "It's colic; have you any ginger?"

"No, I hat only dot soft soap."

What soft soap had to do with ginger was not clear, and Rolf wondered if it had some rare occult
medical power that had escaped his mother.

"Do you know where there's any slippery elm?"

"Yah."

"Then bring a big boiling of the bark, while I get some peppermint."

The elm bark was boiled till it made a kettleful of brown slime. The peppermint was dried above
the stove till it could be powdered, and mixed with the slippery slush. Some sulphur and some
soda were discovered and stirred in, on general principles, and they hastened to the huge,
helpless creature in the field.

Poor Buck seemed worse than ever. He was flat on his side, with his spine humped up, moaning
and straining at intervals. But now relief was in sight--so thought the men. With a tin dipper
they tried to pour some relief into the open mouth of the sufferer, who had so little appreciation
that he simply taxed his remaining strength to blow it out in their faces. Several attempts
ended the same way. Then the brute, in what looked like temper, swung his muzzle and dashed
the whole dipper away. Next they tried the usual method, mixing it with a bran mash, considered
a delicacy in the bovine world, but Buck again took notice, under pressure only, to dash it
away and waste it all.

It occurred to them they might force it down his throat if they could raise his head. So they
used a hand lever and a prop to elevate the muzzle, and were about to try another inpour, when
Buck leaped to his feet, and behaving like one who has been shamming, made at full gallop for
the stable, nor stopped till safely in his stall, where at once he dropped in all the evident
agony of a new spasm.

It is a common thing for oxen to sham sick, but this was the real thing, and it seemed they
were going to lose the ox, which meant also lose a large part of the harvest.

In the stable, now, they had a better chance; they tied him, then raised his head with a lever
till his snout was high above his shoulders. Now it seemed easy to pour the medicine down that
long, sloping passage. But his mouth was tightly closed, any that entered his nostrils was
blown afar, and the suffering beast strained at the rope till he seemed likely to strangle.

Both men and ox were worn out with the struggle; the brute was no better, but rather worse.

"Wall," said Rolf, "I've seen a good many ornery steers, but that's the orneriest I ever did
handle, an' I reckon we'll lose him if he don't get that poison into him pretty soon."

Oxen never were studied as much as horses, for they were considered a temporary shift, and
every farmer looked forward to replacing them with the latter. Oxen were enormously strong,
and they could flourish without grain when the grass was good; they never lost their head in
a swamp hole, and ploughed steadily among all kinds of roots and stumps; but they were exasperatingly
slow and eternally tricky. Bright, being the trickier of the two, was made the nigh ox, to
be more under control. Ordinarily Rolf could manage Buck easily, but the present situation
seemed hopeless. In his memory he harked back to Redding days, and he recalled old Eli Gooch,
the ox expert, and wondered what he would have done. Then, as he sat, he caught sight of the
sick ox reaching out its head and deftly licking up a few drops of bran mash that had fallen
from his yoke fellow's portion. A smile spread over Rolf's face. "Just like you; you think
nothing's good except it's stolen. All right; we'll see." He mixed a big dose of medicine,
with bran, as before. Then he tied Bright's head so that he could not reach the ground, and
set the bucket of mash half way between the two oxen. "Here ye are, Bright," he said, as a
matter of form, and walked out of the stable; but, from a crack, he watched. Buck saw a chance
to steal Bright's bran; he looked around; Oh, joy! his driver was away. He reached out cautiously;
sniffed; his long tongue shot forth for a first taste, when Rolf gave a shout and ran in. "Hi,
you old robber! Let that alone; that's for Bright."

The sick ox was very much in his own stall now, and stayed there for some time after Rolf went
to resume his place at the peephole. But encouraged by a few minutes of silence, he again reached
out, and hastily gulped down a mouthful of the mixture before Rolf shouted and rushed in armed
with a switch to punish the thief. Poor Bright, by his efforts to reach the tempting mash,
was unwittingly playing the game, for this was proof positive of its desirableness.

After giving Buck a few cuts with the switch, Rolf retired, as before. Again the sick ox waited
for silence, and reaching out with greedy haste, he gulped down the rest and emptied the bucket;
seeing which, Rolf ran in and gave the rogue a final trouncing for the sake of consistency.

Any one who knows what slippery elm, peppermint, soda, sulphur, colic, and ox do when thoroughly
interincorporated will not be surprised to learn that in the morning the stable needed special
treatment, and of all the mixture the ox was the only ingredient left on the active list. He
was all right again, very thirsty, and not quite up to his usual standard, but, as Van said,
after a careful look, "Ah, tell you vot, dot you vas a veil ox again, an' I t'ink I know not
vot if you all tricky vas like Bright."

Chapter 57. Rolf and Skookum at Albany

The Red Moon (August) follows the Thunder Moon, and in the early part of its second week Rolf
and Van, hauling in the barley and discussing the fitness of the oats, were startled by a most
outrageous clatter among the hens. Horrid murder evidently was stalking abroad, and, hastening
to the rescue, Rolf heard loud, angry barks; then a savage beast with a defunct "cackle party"
appeared, but dropped the victim to bark and bound upon the "relief party" with ecstatic expressions
of joy, in spite of Rolf's--"Skookum! you little brute!"

Yes! Quonab was back; that is, he was at the lake shore, and Skookum had made haste to plunge
into the joys and gayeties of this social centre, without awaiting the formalities of greeting
or even of dry-shod landing.

The next scene was--a big, high post, a long, strong chain and a small, sad dog.

"Ho, Quonab, you found your people? You had a good time?"

"Ugh," was the answer, the whole of it, and all the light Rolf got for many a day on the old
man's trip to the North. The prospect of going to Albany for Van Cortlandt was much more attractive
to Quonab than that of the harvest field, so a compromise was agreed on. Callan's barley was
in the stock; if all three helped Callan for three days, Callan would owe them for nine, and
so it was arranged.

Again "good-bye," and Rolf, Quonab, and little dog Skookum went sailing down the Schroon toward
the junction, where they left a cache of their supplies, and down the broadening Hudson toward
Albany.

Rolf had been over the road twice; Quonab never before, yet his nose for water was so good
and the sense of rapid and portage was so strong in the red man, that many times he was the
pilot. "This is the way, because it must be"; "there it is deep because so narrow"; "that rapid
is dangerous, because there is such a well-beaten portage trail"; "that we can run, because
I see it," or, "because there is no portage trail," etc. The eighty miles were covered in three
sleeps, and in the mid-moon days of the Red Moon they landed at the dock in front of Peter
Vandam's. If Quonab had any especial emotions for the occasion, he cloaked them perfectly under
a calm and copper-coloured exterior of absolute immobility.

Their Albany experiences included a meeting with the governor and an encounter with a broad
and burly river pirate, who, seeing a lone and peaceable-looking red man, went out of his way
to insult him; and when Quonab's knife flashed out at last, it was only his recently established
relations with the governor's son that saved him from some very sad results, for there were
many loafers about. But burly Vandam appeared in the nick of time to halt the small mob with
the warning: "Don't you know that's Mr. Van Cortlandt's guide?" With the governor and Vandam
to back him, Quonab soon had the mob on his side, and the dock loafer's own friends pelted
him with mud as he escaped. But not a little credit is due to Skookum, for at the critical
moment he had sprung on the ruffian's bare and abundant leg with such toothsome effect that
the owner fell promptly backward and the knife thrust missed. It was quickly over and Quonab
replaced his knife, contemptuous of the whole crowd before, during and after the incident.
Not at the time, but days later, he said of his foe: "He was a talker; he was full of fear."

With the backwoods only thirty miles away, and the unbroken wilderness one hundred, it was
hard to believe how little Henry van Cortlandt knew of the woods and its life. He belonged
to the ultra-fashionable set, and it was rather their pose to affect ignorance of the savage
world and its ways. But he had plenty of common-sense to fan back on, and the inspiring example
of Washington, equally at home in the nation's Parliament, the army intrenchment, the glittering
ball room, or the hunting lodge of the Indian, was a constant reminder that the perfect man
is a harmonious development of mind, morals, and physique.

His training had been somewhat warped by the ultraclassic fashion of the times, so he persisted
in seeing in Quonab a sort of discoloured, barbaric clansman of Alaric or a camp follower of
Xenophon's host, rather than an actual living, interesting, native American, exemplifying in
the highest degree the sinewy, alert woodman, and the saturated mystic and pantheist of an
age bygone and out of date, combined with a middle-measure intelligence. And Rolf, tall, blue-eyed
with brown, curling hair, was made to pose as the youthful Achilles, rather than as a type
of America's best young manhood, cleaner, saner, and of far higher ideals and traditions than
ever were ascribed to Achilles by his most blinded worshippers. It recalled the case of Wordsworth
and Southey living side by side in England; Southey, the famous, must needs seek in ancient
India for material to write his twelve-volume romance that no one ever looks at; Wordsworth,
the unknown, wrote of the things of his own time, about his own door? and produced immortal verse.

What should we think of Homer, had he sung his impressions of the ancient Egyptians? or of
Thackeray, had he novelized the life of the Babylonians? It is an ancient blindness, with an
ancient wall to bruise one's head. It is only those who seek ointment of the consecrated clay
that gives back sight, who see the shining way at their feet, who beat their face against no
wall, who safely climb the heights. Henry van Cortlandt was a man of rare parts, of every advantage,
but still he had been taught steadfastly to live in the past. His eyes were yet to be opened.
The living present was not his--but yet to be.

The young lawyer had been assembling his outfit at Vandam's warehouse, for, in spite of scoffing
friends, he knew that Rolf was coming back to him.

When Rolf saw the pile of stuff that was gathered for that outfit, he stared at it aghast,
then looked at Vandam, and together they roared. There was everything for light housekeeping
and heavy doctoring, even chairs, a wash stand, a mirror, a mortar, and a pestle. Six canoes
could scarcely have carried the lot.

"'Tain't so much the young man as his mother," explained Big Pete; "at first I tried to make
'em understand, but it was no use; so I says, 'All right, go ahead, as long as there's room
in the warehouse.' I reckon I'll set on the fence and have some fun seein' Rolf ontangle the
affair."

"Phew, pheeeww--ph-e-e-e-e-w," was all Rolf could say in answer. But at last, "Wall, there's
always a way. I sized him up as pretty level headed. We'll see."

There was a way and it was easy, for, in a secret session, Rolf, Pete, and Van Cortlandt together
sorted out the things needed. A small tent, blankets, extra clothes, guns, ammunition, delicate
food for three months, a few medicines and toilet articles--a pretty good load for one canoe,
but a trifle compared with the mountain of stuff piled up on the floor.

"Now, Mr. van Cortlandt," said Rolf, "will you explain to your mother that we are going on
with this so as to travel quickly, and will send back for the rest as we need it?"

A quiet chuckle was now heard from Big Pete. "Good! I wondered how he'd settle it."

The governor and his lady saw them off; therefore, there was a crowd. The mother never before
had noted what a frail and dangerous thing a canoe is. She cautioned her son never to venture
out alone, and to be sure that he rubbed his chest with the pectoral balm she had made from
such and such a famous receipt, the one that saved the life but not the limb of old Governor
Stuyvesant, and come right home if you catch a cold; and wait at the first camp till the other
things come, and (in a whisper) keep away from that horrid red Indian with the knife, and never
fail to let every one know who you are, and write regularly, and don't forget to take your
calomel Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, alternating with Peruvian bark Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday, and squills on Sunday, except every other week, when he should devote Tuesdays, Fridays,
and Sundays to rhubarb and catnip tea, except in the full moon, when the catnip was to be replaced
with graveyard bergamot and the squills with opodeldoc in which an iron nail had been left
for a week.

So Henry was embraced, Rolf was hand-shaken, Quonab was nodded at, Skookum was wisely let alone,
and the trim canoe swung from the dock. Amid hearty cheers, farewells, and "God speed ye's"
it breasted the flood for the North.

And on the dock, with kerchief to her eyes, stood the mother, weeping to think that her boy
was going far, far away from his home and friends in dear, cultured, refined Albany, away,
away, to that remote and barbarous inaccessible region almost to the shore land of Lake Champlain.

Chapter 58. Back to Indian Lake

Young Van Cortlandt, six feet two in his socks and thirty-four inches around the chest, was,
as Rolf long afterward said, "awful good raw material, but awful raw." Two years out of college,
half of which had been spent at the law, had done little but launch him as a physical weakling
and a social star. But his mental make-up was more than good; it was of large promise. He lacked
neither courage nor sense, and the course he now followed was surely the best for man-making.

Rolf never realized how much a farmer-woodman-canoeman-hunter-camper had to know, until now
he met a man who did not know anything, nor dreamed how many wrong ways there were of doing
a job, till he saw his new companion try it.

There is no single simple thing that is a more complete measure of one's woodcraft than the
lighting of a fire. There are a dozen good ways and a thousand wrong ones. A man who can light
thirty fires on thirty successive days with thirty matches or thirty sparks from flint and
steel is a graduated woodman, for the feat presupposes experience of many years and the skill
that belongs to a winner.

When Quonab and Rolf came back from taking each a load over the first little portage, they
found Van Cortlandt getting ready for a fire with a great, solid pile of small logs, most of
them wet and green. He knew how to use flint and steel, because that was the established household
way of the times. Since childhood had he lighted the candle at home by this primitive means.
When his pile of soggy logs was ready, he struck his flint, caught a spark on the tinder that
is always kept on hand, blew it to a flame, thrust in between two of the wet logs, waited for
all to blaze up, and wondered why the tiny blaze went out at once, no matter how often he tried.

When the others came back, Van Cortlandt remarked: "It doesn't seem to burn." The Indian turned
away in silent contempt. Rolf had hard work to keep the forms of respect, until the thought
came: "I suppose I looked just as big a fool in his world at Albany."

"See," said he, "green wood and wet wood won't do, but yonder is some birch bark and there's
a pine root." He took his axe and cut a few sticks from the root, then used his knife to make
a sliver-fuzz of each; one piece, so resinous that it would not whittle, he smashed with the
back of the axe into a lot of matchwood. With a handful of finely shredded birch bark he was
now quite ready. A crack of the flint a blowing of the spark caught on the tinder from the
box, a little flame that at once was magnified by the birch bark, and in a minute the pine
splinters made a sputtering fire. Quonab did not even pay Van Cortlandt the compliment of using
one of his logs. He cut a growing poplar, built a fireplace of the green logs around the blaze
that Rolf had made, and the meal was ready in a few minutes.

Van Cortlandt was not a fool; merely it was all new to him. But his attention was directed
to fire-making now, and long before they reached their cabin he had learned this, the first
of the woodman's arts--he could lay and light a fire. And when, weeks later, he not only made
the flint fire, but learned in emergency to make the rubbing stick spark, his cup of joy was
full. He felt he was learning.

Determined to be in everything, now he paddled all day; at first with vigour, then mechanically,
at last feebly and painfully. Late in the afternoon they made the first long portage; it was
a quarter mile. Rolf took a hundred pounds, Quonab half as much more, Van Cortlandt tottered
slowly behind with his pill-kit and his paddle. That night, on his ample mattress, he slept
the sleep of utter exhaustion. Next day he did little and said nothing. It came on to rain;
he raised a huge umbrella and crouched under it till the storm was over. But the third day
he began to show signs of new life, and before they reached the Schroon's mouth, on the fifth
day, his young frame was already responding to the elixir of the hills.

It was very clear that they could not take half of the stuff that they had cached at the Schroon's
mouth, so that a new adjustment was needed and still a cache to await another trip.

That night as they sat by their sixth camp fire, Van Cortlandt pondered over the recent days,
and they seemed many since he had left home. He felt much older and stronger. He felt not only
less strange, but positively intimate with the life, the river, the canoe, and his comrades;
and, pleased with his winnings, he laid his hand on Skookum, slumbering near, only to arouse
in response a savage growl, as that important animal arose and moved to the other side of the
fire. Never did small dog give tall man a more deliberate snub. "You can't do that with Skookum;
you must wait till he's ready," said Rolf.

The journey up the Hudson with its "mean" waters and its "carries" was much as before. Then
they came to the eagle's nest and the easy waters of Jesup's River, and without important incident
they landed at the cabin. The feeling of "home again" spread over the camp and every one was gay.

Chapter 59. Van Cortlandt's Drugs

"AIN'T ye feelin' all right?" said Rolf, one bright, calomel morning, as he saw Van Cortlandt
preparing his daily physic.

"Why, yes; I'm feeling fine; I'm better every day," was the jovial reply.

"Course I don't know, but my mother used to say: 'Med'cine's the stuff makes a sick man well,
an' a well man sick."'

"My mother and your mother would have fought at sight, as you may judge. B-u-t," he added with
reflective slowness, and a merry twinkle in his eye, "if things were to be judged by their
product, I am afraid your mother would win easily," and he laid his long, thin, scrawny hand
beside the broad, strong hand of the growing youth.

"Old Sylvanne wasn't far astray when he said: 'There aren't any sick, 'cept them as thinks
they are,"' said Rolf. "I suppose I ought to begin to taper off," was the reply. But the tapering
was very sudden. Before a week went by, it seemed desirable to go back for the stuff left in
cache on the Schroon, where, of course, it was subject to several risks. There seemed no object
in taking Van Cortlandt back, but they could not well leave him alone. He went. He had kept
time with fair regularity--calomel, rhubarb; calomel, rhubarb; calomel, rhubarb, squills--but
Rolf's remarks had sunk into his intelligence, as a red-hot shot will sink through shingles,
letting in light and creating revolution.

This was a rhubarb morning. He drank his potion, then, carefully stoppering the bottle, he
placed it with its companions in a box and stowed that near the middle of the canoe. "I'll
be glad when it's finished," he said reflectively; "I don't believe I need it now. I wish sometimes
I could run short of it all."

That was what Rolf had been hoping for. Without such a remark, he would not have dared do as
he did. He threw the tent cover over the canoe amidships, causing the unstable craft to cant:
"That won't do," he remarked, and took out several articles, including the medicine chest,
put them ashore under the bushes, and, when he replaced them, contrived that the medicine should
be forgotten.

Next morning Van Cortlandt, rising to prepare his calomel, got a shock to find it not.

"It strikes me," says Rolf, "the last time I saw that, it was on the bank when we trimmed the
canoe." Yes, there could be no doubt of it. Van must live his life in utter druglessness for
a time. It gave him somewhat of a scare, much like that a young swimmer gets when he finds
he has drifted away from his floats; and, like that same beginner, it braced him to help himself.
So Van found that he could swim without corks.

They made a rapid journey down, and in a week they were back with the load.

There was the potion chest where they had left it. Van Cortlandt picked it up with a sheepish
smile, and they sat down for evening meal. Presently Rolf said: "I mind once I seen three little
hawks in a nest together. The mother was teaching them to fly. Two of them started off all
right, and pretty soon were scooting among the treetops. The other was scared. He says: 'No,
mother, I never did fly, and I'm scared I'd get killed if I tried.' At last the mother got
mad and shoved him over. As soon as he felt he was gone, he spread out his wings to save himself.
The wings were all right enough, and long before he struck the ground, he was flying."

Chapter 61. Rolf Learns Something from Van

     A man can't handle his own case, any more than a delirious
     doctor kin give himself the right physic.--Saying of Si
     Sylvanne.

However superior Rolf might feel in the canoe or the woods, there was one place where Van Cortlandt
took the lead, and that was in the long talks they had by the campfire or in Van's own shanty
which Quonab rarely entered.

The most interesting subjects treated in these were ancient Greece and modern Albany. Van Cortlandt
was a good Greek scholar, and, finding an intelligent listener, he told the stirring tales
of royal Ilion, Athens, and Pergamos, with the loving enthusiasm of one whom the teachers found
it easy to instruct in classic lore. And when he recited or intoned the rolling Greek heroics
of the siege of Troy, Rolf listened with an interest that was strange, considering that he
knew not a word of it. But he said, "It sounded like real talk, and the tramp of men that were
all astir with something big a-doing."

Albany and politics, too, were vital strains, and life at the Government House, with the struggling
rings and cabals, social and political. These were extraordinarily funny and whimsical to Rolf.
No doubt because Van Cortlandt presented them that way. And he more than once wondered how
rational humans could waste their time in such tomfoolery and childish things as all conventionalities
seemed to be. Van Cortlandt smiled at his remarks, but made no answer for long.

One day, the first after the completion of Van Cortlandt's cabin, as the two approached, the
owner opened the door and stood aside for Rolf to enter.

"Go ahead," said Rolf.

"After you," was the polite reply.

"Oh, go on," rejoined the lad, in mixed amusement and impatience.

Van Cortlandt touched his hat and went in.

Inside, Rolf turned squarely and said: "The other day you said there was a reason for all kinds
o' social tricks; now will you tell me what the dickens is the why of all these funny-do's?
It 'pears to me a free-born American didn't ought to take off his hat to any one but God."

Van Cortlandt chuckled softly and said: "You may be very sure that everything that is done
in the way of social usage is the result of common-sense, with the exception of one or two
things that have continued after the reason for them has passed, like the buttons you have
behind on your coat; they were put there originally to button the tails out of the way of your
sword. Sword wearing and using have passed away, but still you see the buttons.

"As to taking off your hat to no man: it depends entirely on what you mean by it; and, being
a social custom, you must accept its social meaning.

"In the days of knight errantry, every one meeting a stranger had to suppose him an enemy;
ten to one he was. And the sign and proof of friendly intention was raising the right hand
without a weapon in it. The hand was raised high, to be seen as far as they could shoot with
a bow, and a further proof was added when they raised the vizor and exposed the face. The danger
of the highway continued long after knights ceased to wear armour; so, with the same meaning,
the same gesture was used, but with a lifting of the hat. If a man did not do it, he was either
showing contempt, or hostility for the other, or proving himself an ignorant brute. So, in
all civilized countries, lifting the hat is a sign of mutual confidence and respect."

"Well! that makes it all look different. But why should you touch your hat when you went ahead
of me just now?"

"Because this is my house; you are my guest. I am supposed to serve you in reasonable ways
and give you precedence. Had I let you open my door for me, it would have been putting you
in the place of my servant; to balance that, I give you the sign of equality and respect."

"H'm," said Rolf, "'it just shows,' as old Sylvanne sez, 'this yer steel-trap, hair-trigger,
cocksure jedgment don't do. An' the more a man learns, the less sure he gits. An' things as
hez lasted a long time ain't liable to be on a rotten foundation.'"

Chapter 62. The Charm of Song

With a regular tum ta tum ta, came a weird sound from the sunrise rock one morning, as Van
slipped out of his cabin.

     "Ag-aj-way-o-say
     Pem-o-say
     Gezhik-om era-bid ah-keen
     Ena-bid ah-keen"

"What's he doing, Rolf?"

"That's his sunrise prayer," was the answer.

"Do you know what it means?"

"Yes, it ain't much; jest 'Oh, thou that walkest in the sky in the morning, I greet thee."'

"Why, I didn't know Indians had such performances; that's exactly like the priests of Osiris.
Did any one teach him? I mean any white folk."

"No, it's always been the Indian way. They have a song or a prayer for most every big event,
sunrise, sunset, moonrise, good hunting, and another for when they're sick, or when they're
going on a journey, or when their heart is bad."

"You astonish me. I had no idea they were so human. It carries me back to the temple of Delphi.
It is worthy of Cassandra of Ilion. I supposed all Indians were just savage Indians that hunted
till their bellies were full, and slept till they were empty again."

"H'm," rejoined Rolf, with a gentle laugh. "I see you also have been doing some 'hair-trigger,
steel-trap, cocksure jedgin'.'"

"I wonder if he'd like to hear some of my songs?"

"It's worth trying; anyway, I would," said Rolf.

That night, by the fire, Van sang the "Gay Cavalier," "The Hunting of John Peel," and "Bonnie
Dundee." He had a fine baritone voice. He was most acceptable in the musical circles of Albany.
Rolf was delighted, Skookum moaned sympathetically, and Quonab sat nor moved till the music
was over. He said nothing, but Rolf felt that it was a point gained, and, trying to follow
it up, said:

"Here's your drum, Quonab; won't you sing 'The Song of the Wabanaki?'" But it was not well
timed, and the Indian shook his head.

"Say, Van," said Rolf, (Van Cortlandt had suggested this abbreviation) "you'll never stand
right with Quonab till you kill a deer."

"I've done some trying."

"Well, now, we'll go out to-morrow evening and try once more. What do you think of the weather,
Quonab?"

"Storm begin noon and last three days," was the brief answer, as the red man walked away.

"That settles it," said Rolf; "we wait."

Van was surprised, and all the more so when in an hour the sky grew black and heavy rain set
in, with squalls.

"How in the name of Belshazzar's weather bugler does he tell?"

"I guess you better not ask him, if you want to know. I'll find out and tell you later."

Rolf learned, not easily or at single talk:

"Yesterday the chipmunks worked hard; to-day there are none to be seen.

"Yesterday the loons were wailing; now they are still, and no small birds are about.

"Yesterday it was a yellow sunrise; to-day a rosy dawn.

"Last night the moon changed and had a thick little ring.

"It has not rained for ten days, and this is the third day of easterly winds.

"There was no dew last night. I saw Tongue Mountain at daybreak; my tom-tom will not sing.

"The smoke went three ways at dawn, and Skookum's nose was hot."

So they rested, not knowing, but forced to believe, and it was not till the third day that
the sky broke; the west wind began to pay back its borrowings from the east, and the saying
was proved that "three days' rain will empty any sky."

That evening, after their meal, Rolf and Van launched the canoe and paddled down the lake.
A mile from camp they landed, for this was a favourite deer run. Very soon Rolf pointed to
the ground. He had found a perfectly fresh track, but Van seemed not to comprehend. They went
along it, Rolf softly and silently, Van with his long feet and legs making a dangerous amount
of clatter. Rolf turned and whispered, "That won't do. You must not stand on dry sticks." Van
endeavoured to move more cautiously and thought he was doing well, but Rolf found it very trying
to his patience and began to understand how Quonab had felt about himself a year ago. "See,"
said Rolf, "lift your legs so; don't turn your feet out that way. Look at the place before
you put it down again; feel with your toe to make sure there is no dead stick, then wriggle
it down to the solid ground. Of course, you'd do better in moccasins. Never brush past any
branches; lift them aside and don't let them scratch; ease them back to the place; never try
to bend a dry branch; go around it," etc. Van had not thought of these things, but now he grasped
them quickly, and they made a wonderful improvement in his way of going.

They came again to the water's edge; across a little bay Rolf sighted at once the form of a
buck, perfectly still, gazing their way, wondering, no doubt, what made those noises.

"Here's your chance," he whispered.

"Where?" was the eager query.

"There; see that gray and white thing?"

"I can't see him."

For five minutes Rolf tried in vain to make his friend see that statuesque form; for five minutes
it never moved. Then, sensing danger, the buck gave a bound and was lost to view.

It was disheartening. Rolf sat down, nearly disgusted; then one of Sylvanne's remarks came
to him: "It don't prove any one a fool, coz he can't play your game."

Presently Rolf said, "Van, hev ye a book with ye?"

"Yes, I have my Virgil."

"Read me the first page."

Van read it, holding the book six inches from his nose.

"Let's see ye read this page there," and Rolf held it up four feet away.

"I can't; it's nothing but a dim white spot."

"Well, can ye see that loon out there?"

"You mean that long, dark thing in the bay?"

"No, that's a pine log close to," said Rolf, with a laugh, "away out half a mile."

"No, I can't see anything but shimmers."

"I thought so. It's no use your trying to shoot deer till ye get a pair of specs to fit yer
eyes. You have brains enough, but you haven't got the eyesight of a hunter. You stay here till
I go see if I have any luck."

Rolf melted into the woods. In twenty minutes Van heard a shot and very soon Rolf reappeared,
carrying a two-year-old buck, and they returned to their camp by nightfall. Quonab glanced
at their faces as they passed carrying the little buck. They tried to look inscrutable. But
the Indian was not deceived. He gave out nothing but a sizzling "Humph!"

Chapter 63. The Redemption of Van

"WHEN things is looking black as black can be, it's a sure sign of luck coming your way." so
said Si Sylvanne, and so it proved to Van Cortlandt The Moon of the Falling Leaves was waning,
October was nearly over, the day of his return to Albany was near, as he was to go out in time
for the hunters to return in open water. He was wonderfully improved in strength and looks.
His face was brown and ruddy. He had abandoned all drugs, and had gained fully twenty pounds
in weight. He had learned to make a fire, paddle a canoe, and go through the woods in semi-silence.
His scholarly talk had given him large place in Rolf's esteem, and his sweet singing had furnished
a tiny little shelf for a modicum of Quonab's respect. But his attempts to get a deer were
failures. "You come back next year with proper, farsight glasses and you'll all right," said
Rolf; and that seemed the one ray of hope.

The three days' storm had thrown so many trees that the hunters decided it would be worth while
making a fast trip down to Eagle's Nest, to cut such timber as might have fallen across the
stream, and so make an easy way for when they should have less time.

The surmise was quite right. Much new-fallen timber was now across the channel. They chopped
over twenty-five trunks before they reached Eagle's Nest at noon, and, leaving the river in
better shape than ever it was, they turned, for the swift, straight, silent run of ten miles home.

As they rounded the last point, a huge black form in the water loomed to view. Skookum's bristles
rose. Quonab whispered, "Moose! Shoot quick!" Van was the only one with a gun. The great black
beast stood for a moment, gazing at them with wide-open eyes, ears, and nostrils, then shook
his broad horns, wheeled, and dashed for the shore. Van fired and the bull went down with a
mighty splash among the lilies. Rolf and Skookum let off a succession of most unhunterlike
yells of triumph. But the giant sprang up again and reached the shore, only to fall to Van
Cortlandt's second barrel. Yet the stop was momentary; he rose and dashed into the cover. Quonab
turned the canoe at once and made for the land.

A great sob came from the bushes, then others at intervals. Quonab showed his teeth and pointed.
Rolf seized his rifle, Skookum sprang from the boat, and a little later was heard letting off
his war-cry in the bushes not far away.

The men rushed forward, guns in hand, but Quonab called, "Look out! Maybe he waiting."

"If he is, he'll likely get one of us." said Rolf, with a light laugh, for he had some hearsay
knowledge of moose.

Covered each by a tree, they waited till Van had reloaded his double-barrelled, then cautiously
approached. The great frothing sobs had resounded from time to time.

Skookum's voice also was heard in the thicket, and when they neared and glimpsed the place,
it was to see the monster on the ground, lying at full length, dinging up his head at times
when he uttered that horrid sound of pain.

The Indian sent a bullet through the moose's brain; then all was still, the tragedy was over.

But now their attention was turned to Van Cortlandt. He reeled, staggered, his knees trembled,
his face turned white, and, to save himself from falling, he sank onto a log. Here he covered
his face with his hands, his feet beat the ground, and his shoulders heaved up and down.

The others said nothing. They knew by the signs and the sounds that it was only through a mighty
effort that young Van Cortlandt, grown man as he was, could keep himself from hysterical sobs
and tears.

Not then, but the next day it was that Quonab said: "It comes to some after they kill, to some
before, as it came to you, Rolf; to me it came the day I killed my first chipmunk, that time
when I stole my father's medicine."

They had ample work for several hours now, to skin the game and save the meat. It was fortunate
they were so near home. A marvellous change there was in the atmosphere of the camp. Twice
Quonab spoke to Van Cortlandt, as the latter laboured with them to save and store the meat
of his moose. He was rubbed, doped, soiled, and anointed with its flesh, hair, and blood, and
that night, as they sat by their camp fire, Skookum arose, stretched, yawned, walked around
deliberately, put his nose in the lawyer's hand, gave it a lick, then lay down by his feet.
Van Cortlandt glanced at Rolf, a merry twinkle was in the eyes of both. "It's all right. You
can pat Skookum now, without risk of being crippled. He's sized you up. You are one of us at
last;" and Quonab looked on with two long ivory rows a-gleaming in his smile.

Chapter 64. Dinner at the Governor's

Was ever there a brighter blazing sunrise after such a night of gloom? Not only a deer, but
the biggest of all deer, and Van himself the only one of the party that had ever killed a moose.
The skin was removed and afterward made into a hunting coat for the victor. The head and horns
were carefully preserved to be carried back to Albany, where they were mounted and still hang
in the hall of a later generation of the name. The final days at the camp were days of happy
feeling; they passed too soon, and the long-legged lawyer, bronzed and healthy looking, took
his place in their canoe for the flying trip to Albany. With an empty canoe and three paddles
(two and one half, Van said), they flew down the open stretch of Jesup's River in something
over two hours and camped that night fully thirty-five miles from their cabin. The next day
they nearly reached the Schroon and in a week they rounded the great bend, and Albany hove in view.

How Van's heart did beat! How he did exult to come in triumph home, reestablished in health
and strengthened in every way. They were sighted and recognized. Messengers were seen running;
a heavy gun was fired, the flag run up on the Capitol, bells set a-ringing, many people came
running, and more flags ran up on vessels.

A great crowd gathered by the dock.

"There's father, and mother too!" shouted Van, waving his hat.

"Hurrah," and the crowd took it up, while the bells went jingle, jangle, and Skookum in the
bow sent back his best in answer.

The canoe was dragged ashore. Van seized his mother in his arms, as she cried: "My boy, my
boy, my darling boy! how well you look. Oh, why didn't you write? But, thank God, you are back
again, and looking so healthy and strong. I know you took your squills and opodeldoc. Thank
God for that! Oh, I'm so happy! my boy, my boy! There's nothing like squills and God's blessing."

Rolf and Quonab were made to feel that they had a part in it all. The governor shook them warmly
by the hand, and then a friendly voice was heard: "Wall, boy, here ye air agin; growed a little,
settin' up and sassin' back, same as ever." Rolf turned to see the gigantic, angular form and
kindly face of grizzly old Si Sylvanne and was still more surprised to hear him addressed "senator."

"Yes," said the senator, "one o' them freak elections that sometimes hits right; great luck
for Albany, wa'nt it?"

"Ho," said Quonab, shaking the senator's hand, while Skookum looked puzzled and depressed.

"Now, remember," said the governor, addressing the Indian, the lad, and the senator, "we expect
you to dine tonight at the mansion; seven o'clock."

Then the terror of the dragon conventionality, that guards the gate and hovers over the feast,
loomed up in Rolf's imagination. He sought a private word with Van. "I'm afraid I have no fit
clothes; I shan't know how to behave," he said.

"Then I'll show you. The first thing is to be perfectly clean and get a shave; put on the best
clothes you have, and be sure they're clean; then you come at exactly seven o'clock, knowing
that every one is going to be kind to you and you're bound to have a good time. As to any other
'funny-do' you watch me, and you'll have no trouble."

So when the seven o'clock assemblage came, and guests were ascending the steps of the governor's
mansion, there also mounted a tall, slim youth, an easy-pacing Indian, and a prick-eared, yellow
dog. Young Van Cortlandt was near the door, on watch to save them any embarrassment. But what
a swell he looked, cleanshaven, ruddy, tall, and handsome in the uniform of an American captain,
surrounded by friends and immensely popular. How different it all was from that lonely cabin
by the lake.

A butler who tried to remove Skookum was saved from mutilation by the intervention first of
Quonab and next of Van; and when they sat down, this uncompromising four-legged child of the
forest ensconced himself under Quonab's chair and growled whenever the silk stockings of the
footman seemed to approach beyond the line of true respect.

Young Van Cortlandt was chief talker at the dinner, but a pompous military man was prominent
in the company. Once or twice Rolf was addressed by the governor or Lady Van Cortlandt, and
had to speak to the whole table; his cheeks were crimson, but he knew what he wanted to say
and stopped when it was said, so suffered no real embarrassment.

After what seemed an interminable feast of countless dishes and hours' duration, an extraordinary
change set in. Led by the hostess, all stood up, the chairs were lifted out of their way, and
the ladies trooped into another room; the doors were closed, and the men sat down again at
the end next the governor.

Van stayed by Rolf and explained: "This is another social custom that began with a different
meaning. One hundred years ago, every man got drunk at every formal dinner, and carried on
in a way that the ladies did not care to see, so to save their own feelings and give the men
a free rein, the ladies withdrew. Nowadays, men are not supposed to indulge in any such orgy,
but the custom continues, because it gives the men a chance to smoke, and the ladies a chance
to discuss matters that do not interest the men. So again you see it is backed by common sense."

This proved the best part of the dinner to Rolf. There was a peculiar sense of over-politeness,
of insincerity, almost, while the ladies were present; the most of the talking had been done
by young Van Cortlandt and certain young ladies, assisted by some very gay young men and the
general. Their chatter was funny, but nothing more. Now a different air was on the group; different
subjects were discussed, and by different men, in a totally different manner.

"We've stood just about all we can stand," said the governor, alluding to an incident newly
told, of a British frigate boarding an American merchant vessel by force and carrying off half
her crew, under presence that they were British seamen in disguise. "That's been going on for
three years now. It's either piracy or war, and, in either case, it's our duty to fight."

"Jersey's dead against war," said a legislator from down the river.

"Jersey always was dead against everything that was for the national good, sir," said a red-faced,
puffy, military man, with a husky voice, a rolling eye, and a way of ending every sentence
in "sir."

"So is Connecticut," said another; "they say, 'Look at all our defenceless coasts and harbour
towns.'"

"They're not risking as much as New York," answered the governor, "with her harbours all the
way up the Hudson and her back door open to invasion from Canada."

"Fortunately, sir, Pennyslvania, Maryland, and the West have not forgotten the glories of the
past. All I ask--is a chance to show what we can do, sir. I long for the smell of powder once
more, sir."

"I understand that President Madison has sent several protests, and, in spite of Connecticut
and New Jersey, will send an ultimatum within three months. He believes that Britain has all
she can manage, with Napoleon and his allies battering at her doors, and will not risk a war.

"It's my opinion," said Sylvanne; "that these English men is too pig-headed an' ornery to care
a whoop in hell whether we get mad or not. They've a notion Paul Jones is dead, but I reckon
we've got plenty of the breed only waitin' a chance. Mor'n twenty-five of our merchantmen wrecked
each year through being stripped of their crews by a 'friendly power.' 'Pears to me we couldn't
be worse off going to war, an' might be a dum sight better."

"Your home an' holdings are three hundred safe miles from the seacoast," objected the man from
Manhattan.

"Yes, and right next Canada," was the reply.

"The continued insults to our flag, sir, and the personal indignities offered to our people
are even worse than the actual loss in ships and goods. It makes my blood fairly boil," and
the worthy general looked the part as his purple jowl quivered over his white cravat.

"Gosh all hemlock! the one pricks, but t'other festers, it's tarnal sure you steal a man's
dinner and tell him he's one o' nature's noblemen, he's more apt to love you than if you give
him five dollars to keep out o' your sight," said Sylvanne, with slow emphasis.

"There's something to be said on the other side," said the timid one. "You surely allow that
the British government is trying to do right, and after all we must admit that that Jilson
affair resected very little credit on our own administration."

"A man ken make one awful big mistake an' still be all right, but he can't go on making a little
mistake every day right along an' be fit company for a clean crowd," retorted the new senator.

At length the governor rose and led the way to the drawing-room, where they rejoined the ladies
and the conversation took on a different colour and weight, by which it lost all value for
those who knew not the art of twittering persiflage and found less joy in a handkerchief flirtation
than in the nation's onward march. Rolf and Quonab enjoyed it now about as much as Skookum
had done all the time.

Chapter 65. The Grebes and the Singing Mouse

Quonab puzzled long over the amazing fact that young Van Cortlandt had evident high standing
"in his own tribe." "He must be a wise counsellor, for I know he cannot fight and is a fool
at hunting," was the ultimate decision.

They had a final interview with the governor and his son before they left. Rolf received for
himself and his partner the promised one hundred and fifty dollars, and the hearty thanks of
all in the governor's home. Next, each was presented with a handsome hunting knife, not unlike
the one young Van had carried, but smaller. Quonab received his with "Ho--" then, after a pause,
"He pull out, maybe, when I need him."--"Ho! good!" he exclaimed, as the keen blade appeared.

"Now, Rolf," said the lawyer, "I want to come back next year and bring three companions, and
we will pay you at the same rate per month for each. What do you say?"

"Glad to have you again," said Rolf: "we'll come for you on August fifteenth; but remember
you should bring your guitar and your spectacles."

"One word," said the governor, "do you know the canoe route through Champlain to Canada?"

"Quonab does."

"Could you undertake to render scout service in that region?"

The Indian nodded.

"In case of war, we may need you both, so keep your ears open."

And once more the canoe made for the north, with Quonab in the stern and Skookum in the bow.

In less than a week they were home, and none too soon; for already the trees were bare, and
they had to break the ice on the river before they ended their trip.

Rolf had gathered many ideas the last two-months. He did not propose to continue all his life
as a trapper. He wanted to see New York. He wanted to plan for the future. He needed money
for his plans. He and Quonab had been running a hundred miles of traps, but some men run more
than that single handed. They must get out two new lines at once, before the frost came. One
of these they laid up the Hudson, above Eagle's Nest; the other northerly on Blue Mountain,
toward Racquet River. Doing this was hard work, and when they came again to their cabin the
robins had gone from the bleak and leafless woods; the grouse were making long night flights;
the hollows had tracks of racing deer; there was a sense of omen, a length of gloom, for the
Mad Moon was afloat in the shimmering sky; its wan light ghasted all the hills.

Next day the lake was covered with thin, glare ice; on the glassy surface near the shore were
two ducks floundering. The men went as near as they could, and Quonab said, "No, not duck,
but Shingebis, divers. They cannot rise except from water. In the night the new ice looks like
water; they come down and cannot rise. I have often seen it." Two days after, a harder frost
came on. The ice was safe for a dog; the divers or grebes were still on its surface. So they
sent Skookum. He soon returned with two beautiful grebes, whose shining, white breast feathers
are as much prized as some furs.

Quonab grunted as he held them up. "Ugh, it is often so in this Mad Moon. My father said it
is because of Kaluskap's dancing."

"I don't remember that one."

"Yes, long ago. Kaluskap felt lazy. He wanted to eat, but did not wish to hunt, so he called
the bluejay and said: 'Tell all the woods that to-morrow night Kaluskap gives a new dance and
teaches a new song,' and he told the hoot owl to do the same, so one kept it up all day--'Kaluskap
teaches a new dance to-morrow night,' and the other kept it up all night: 'Kaluskap teaches
a new song at next council.'

"Thus it came about that all the woods and waters sent their folk to the dance.

"Then Kaluskap took his song-drum and said: 'When I drum and sing you must dance in a circle
the same way as the sun, close your eyes tightly, and each one shout his war whoop, as I cry
"new songs"!'

"So all began, with Kaluskap drumming in the middle, singing:

"'New songs from the south, brothers, Close your eyes tightly, brothers, Dance and learn a
new song.

"As they danced around, he picked out the fattest, and, reaching out one hand, seized them
and twisted their necks, shouting out, 'More war-cries, more poise! that's it; now you are
learning!'

"At length Shingebis the diver began to have his doubts and he cautiously opened one eye, saw
the trick, and shouted: 'Fly, brothers, fly! Kaluskap is killing us!'

"Then all was confusion. Every one tried to escape, and Kaluskap, in revenge, tried to kill
the Shingebis. But the diver ran for the water and, just as he reached the edge, Kaluskap gave
him a kick behind that sent him half a mile, but it knocked off all his tail feathers and twisted
his shape so that ever since his legs have stuck out where his tail was, and he cannot rise
from the land or the ice. I know it is so, for my father, Cos Cob, told me it was true, and
we ourselves have seen it. It is ever so. To go against Kaluskap brings much evil to brood over."

A few nights later, as they sat by their fire in the cabin, a curious squeaking was heard behind
the logs. They had often heard it before, but never so much as now. Skookum turned his head
on one side, set his ears at forward cock. Presently, from a hole 'twixt logs and chimney,
there appeared a small, white breasted mouse.

Its nose and ears shivered a little; its black eyes danced in the firelight. It climbed up
to a higher log, scratched its ribs, then rising on its hind legs, uttered one or two squeaks
like those they had heard so often, but soon they became louder and continuous:

"Peg, peo, peo, peo, peo, peo, peo, oo. Tree, tree, tree, tree, trrrrrrr, Turr, turr, turr,
tur, tur, Wee, wee, wee, we"--

The little creature was sitting up high on its hind legs, its belly muscles were working, its
mouth was gaping as it poured out its music. For fully half a minute this went on, when Skookum
made a dash; but the mouse was quick and it flashed into the safety of its cranny.

Rolf gazed at Quonab inquiringly.

"That is Mish-a-boh-quas, the singing mouse. He always comes to tell of war. In a little while
there will be fighting."

Chapter 66. A Lesson in Stalking

"Did you ever see any fighting, Quonab?"

"Ugh! In Revolution, scouted for General Gates."

"Judging by the talk, we're liable to be called on before a year. What will you do?"

"Fight."

"As soldier?"

"No! scout."

"They may not want us."

"Always want scouts," replied the Indian.

"It seems to me I ought to start training now."

"You have been training."

"How is that?"

"A scout is everything that an army is, but it's all in one man. An' he don't have to keep step."

"I see, I see," replied Rolf, and he realized that a scout is merely a trained hunter who is
compelled by war to hunt his country's foes instead of the beasts of the woods.

"See that?" said the Indian, and he pointed to a buck that was nosing for cranberries in the
open expanse across the river where it left the lake. "Now, I show you scouting." He glanced
at the smoke from the fire, found it right for his plan, and said: "See! I take my bow. No
cover, yet I will come close and kill that deer."

Then began a performance that was new to Rolf, and showed that the Indian had indeed reached
the highest pitch of woodcraft. He took his bow and three good arrows, tied a band around his
head, and into this stuck a lot of twigs and vines, so that his head looked like a tussock
of herbage. Then he left the shanty door, and, concealed by the last bushes on the edge, he
reached the open plain. Two hundred yards off was the buck, nosing among the herbage, and,
from time to time, raising its superb head and columnar neck to look around. There was no cover
but creeping herbage. Rolf suspected that the Indian would decoy the buck by some whistle or
challenge, for the thickness of its neck showed the deer to be in fighting humour.

Flat on his breast the Indian lay. His knees and elbow seemed to develop centipedic power;
his head was a mere clump of growing stuff. He snaked his way quietly for twenty-five yards,
then came to the open, sloping shore, with the river forty yards wide of level shining ice,
all in plain view of the deer; how was this to be covered?

There is a well-known peculiarity of the white tail that the Indian was counting on; when its
head is down grazing, even though not hidden, the deer does not see distant objects; before
the head is raised, its tail is raised or shaken. Quonab knew that if he could keep the tail
in view, he could avoid being viewed by the head. In a word, only an ill-timed movement or
a whiff could betray him.

The open ice was, of course, a hard test, and the hunter might have failed, but that his long
form looked like one of the logs that were lying about half stranded or frozen in the stream.

Watching ever the alert head and tail, he timed his approach, working hard and moving East
when the head was down; but when warned by a tail-jerk he turned to a log nor moved a muscle.
Once the ice was crossed, the danger of being seen was less, but of being smelt was greater,
for the deer was moving about, and Quonab watched the smoke from the cabin for knowledge of
the wind. So he came within fifty yards, and the buck, still sniffing along and eagerly champing
the few red cranberries it found above the frozen moss, was working toward a somewhat higher
cover. The herbage was now fully eighteen inches high, and Quonab moved a little faster. The
buck found a large patch of berries under a tussock and dropped on its knees to pick them out,
while Quonab saw the chance and gained ten yards before the tail gave warning. After so long
a feeding-spell, the buck took an extra long lookout, and then walked toward the timber, whereby
the Indian lost all he had gained. But the browser's eye was drawn by a shining bunch of red,
then another; and now the buck swung until there was danger of betrayal by the wind; then down
went its head and Quonab retreated ten yards to keep the windward. Once the buck raised its
muzzle and sniffed with flaring nostrils, as though its ancient friend had brought a warning.
But soon he seemed reassured, for the landscape showed no foe, and nosed back and forth, while
Quonab regained the yards he had lost. The buck worked now to the taller cover, and again a
tempting bunch of berries under a low, dense bush caused it to kneel for farther under-reaching.
Quonab glided swiftly forward, reached the twenty-five-yard limit, rose to one knee, bent the
stark cedar bow. Rolf saw the buck bound in air, then make for the wood with great, high leaps;
the dash of disappointment was on him, but Quonab stood erect, with right hand raised, and shouted:

"Ho--ho."

He knew that those bounds were unnecessarily high, and before the woods had swallowed up the
buck, it fell--rose--and fell again, to rise not. The arrow had pierced its heart.

Then Rolf rushed up with kindled eye and exultant pride to slap his friend on the back, and
exclaim:

"I never thought it possible; the greatest feat in hunting I ever saw; you are a wonder!"

To which the Indian softly replied, as he smiled:

"Ho! it was so I got eleven British sentries in the war. They gave me a medal with Washington's
head."

"They did! how is it I never heard of it? Where is it?"

The Indian's face darkened. "I threw it after the ship that stole my Gamowini."

Chapter 67. Rolf Meets a Canuck

The winter might have been considered eventful, had not so many of the events been repetitions
of former experience. But there were several that by their newness deserve a place on these
pages, as they did in Rolf's memory.

One of them happened soon after the first sharp frost. It had been an autumn of little rain,
so that many ponds had dried up, with the result that hundreds of muskrats were forced out
to seek more habitable quarters. The first time Rolf saw one of these stranded mariners on
its overland journey, he gave heedless chase. At first it made awkward haste to escape; then
a second muskrat was discovered just ahead, and a third. This added to Rolf's interest. In
a few bounds he was among them, but it was to get a surprise. Finding themselves overtaken,
the muskrats turned in desperation and attacked the common enemy with courage and fury. Rolf
leaped over the first, but the second sprang, caught him by the slack of the trouser leg, and
hung on. The third flung itself on his foot and drove its sharp teeth through the moccasin.
Quickly the first rallied and sprang on his other leg with all the force of its puny paws,
and powerful jaws.

Meanwhile Quonab was laughing aloud and holding back Skookum, who, breathing fire and slaughter,
was mad to be in the fight.

"Ho! a good fight! good musquas! Ho, Skookum, you must not always take care of him, or he will
not learn to go alone.

"Ugh, good!" as the third muskrat gripped Rolf by the calf.

There could be but one finish, and that not long delayed. A well-placed kick on one, the second
swung by the tail, the third crushed under his heel, and the affair ended. Rolf had three muskrats
and five cuts. Quonab had much joy and Skookum a sense of lost opportunity.

"This we should paint on the wigwam," said Quonab. "Three great warriors attacked one Sagamore.
They were very brave, but he was Nibowaka and very strong; he struck them down as the Thunderbird,
Hurakan, strikes the dead pines the fire has left on the hilltop against the sky. Now shall
you eat their hearts, for they were brave. My father told me a fighting muskrat's heart is
great medicine; for he seeks peace while it is possible, then he turns and fights without fear."

A few days later, they sighted a fox. In order to have a joke on Skookum, they put him on its
track, and away he went, letting off his joy-whoops at every jump. The men sat down to wait,
knowing full well that after an hour Skookum would come back with a long tongue and an air
of depression. But they were favoured with an unexpected view of the chase. It showed a fox
bounding over the snow, and not twenty yards behind was their energetic four-legged colleague.

And, still more unexpected, the fox was overtaken in the next thicket, shaken to limpness,
and dragged to be dropped at Quonab's feet. This glorious victory by Skookum was less surprising,
when a closer examination showed that the fox had been in a bad way. Through some sad, sudden
indiscretion, he had tackled a porcupine and paid the penalty. His mouth, jaws and face, neck
and legs, were bristling with quills. He was sick and emaciated. He could not have lasted many
days longer, and Skookum's summary lynching was a blessing in disguise.

The trappers' usual routine was varied by a more important happening. One day of deep snow
in January, when they were running the northern line on Racquet River, they camped for the
night at their shelter cabin, and were somewhat surprised at dusk to hear a loud challenge
from Skookum replied to by a human voice, and a short man with black whiskers appeared. He
raised one hand in token of friendliness and was invited to come in.

He was a French Canadian from La Colle Mills. He had trapped here for some years. The almost
certainty of war between Canada and the States had kept his usual companions away. So he had
trapped alone, always a dangerous business, and had gathered a lot of good fur, but had fallen
on the ice and hurt himself inwardly, so that he had no strength. He could tramp out on snowshoes,
but could not carry his pack of furs. He had long known that he had neighbours on the south;
the camp fire smoke proved that, and he had come now to offer all his furs for sale.

Quonab shook his head, but Rolf said, "We'll come over and see them."

A two-hours' tramp in the morning brought them to the Frenchman's cabin. He opened out his
furs; several otter, many sable, some lynx, over thirty beaver--the whole lot for two hundred
dollars. At Lyons Falls they were worth double that.

Rolf saw a chance for a bargain. He whispered, "We can double our money on it, Quonab. What
do ye say?"

The reply was simply, "Ugh! you are Nibowaka."

"We'll take your offer, if we can fix it up about payment, for I have no money with me and
barely two hundred dollars at the cabin."

"You half tabac and grosairs?"

"Yes, plenty."

"You can go 'get 'em? Si?"

Rolf paused, looked down, then straight at the Frenchman.

"Will you trust me to take half the fur now; when I come back with the pay I can get the rest."

The Frenchman looked puzzled, then, "By Gar you look de good look. I let um go. I tink you
pretty good fellow, parbleu!"

So Rolf marched away with half the furs and four days later he was back and paid the pale-faced
but happy Frenchman the one hundred and fifty dollars he had received from Van Cortlandt, with
other bills making one hundred and ninety-five dollars and with groceries and tobacco enough
to satisfy the trapper. The Frenchman proved a most amiable character. He and Rolf took to
each other greatly, and when they shook hands at parting, it was in the hope of an early and
happier meeting.

Francois la Colle turned bravely for the ninety-mile tramp over the snow to his home, while
Rolf went south with the furs that were to prove a most profitable investment, shaping his
life in several ways, and indirectly indeed of saving it on one occasion.

Chapter 68. War

Eighteen hundred and twelve had passed away. President Madison, driven by wrongs to his countrymen
and indignities that no nation should meekly accept, had in the midsummer declared war on Great
Britain. Unfitted to cope with the situation and surrounded by unfit counsellors, his little
army of heroic men led by unfit commanders had suffered one reverse after another.

The loss of Fort Mackinaw, Chicago, Detroit, Brownstown, and the total destruction of the American
army that attacked Queenstown were but poorly offset by the victory at Niagara and the successful
defence of Ogdensburg.

Rolf and Quonab had repaired to Albany as arranged, but they left it as United States scouts,
not as guides to the four young sportsmen who wished to hark back to the primitive.

Their first commission had been the bearing of despatches to Plattsburg.

With a selected light canoe and a minimum of baggage they reached Ticonderoga in two days,
and there renewed their acquaintance with General Hampton, who was fussing about, and digging
useless entrenchments as though he expected a mighty siege. Rolf was called before him to receive
other despatches for Colonel Pike at Plattsburg. He got the papers and learned their destination,
then immediately made a sad mistake. "Excuse me, sir," he began, "if I meet with--"

"Young man," said the general, severely, "I don't want any of your 'ifs' or 'buts'; your orders
are 'go.' 'How' and 'if' are matters for you to find out; that's what you are paid for."

Rolf bowed; his cheeks were tingling. He was very angry at what he thought a most uncalled
for rebuke, but he got over it, and he never forgot the lesson. It was Si Sylvanne that put
it into rememberable form.

"A fool horse kin follow a turnpike, but it takes a man with wits to climb, swim, boat, skate,
run, hide, go it blind, pick a lock, take the long way, round, when it's the short way across,
run away at the right time, or fight when it's wise--all in one afternoon." Rolf set out for
the north carrying a bombastic (meant to be reassuring) message from Hampton that he would
annihilate any enemy who dared to desecrate the waters of the lake.

It was on this trip that Rolf learned from Quonab the details of the latter's visit to his
people on the St. Regis. Apparently the joy of meeting a few of his own kin, with whom he could
talk his own language, was offset by meeting with a large number of his ancient enemies the
Mohawks. There had been much discussion of the possible war between the British and the Yankees.
The Mohawks announced their intention to fight for the British, which was a sufficient reason
for Quonab as a Sinawa remaining with the Americans; and when he left the St. Regis reserve
the Indian was without any desire to reenter it.

At Plattsburg Rolf and Quonab met with another Albany acquaintance in General Wilkinson, and
from him received despatches which they brought back to Albany, having covered the whole distance
in eight days.

When 1812 was gone Rolf had done little but carry despatches up and down Lake Champlain. Next
season found the Americans still under command of Generals Wilkinson and Hampton, whose utter
incompetence was becoming daily more evident.

The year 1813 saw Rolf, eighteen years old and six feet one in his socks, a trained scout and
despatch bearer.

By a flying trip on snowshoes in January he took letters, from General Hampton at Ticonderoga
to Sackett's Harbour and back in eight days, nearly three hundred miles. It made him famous
as a runner, but the tidings that he brought were sad. Through him they learned in detail of
the total defeat and capture of the American army at Frenchtown. After a brief rest he was
sent across country on snowshoes to bear a reassuring message to Ogdensburg. The weather was
much colder now, and the single blanket bed was dangerously slight; so "Flying Kittering,"
as they named him, took a toboggan and secured Quonab as his running mate. Skookum was given
into safe keeping. Blankets, pots, cups, food, guns, and despatches were strapped on the toboggan,
and they sped away at dawn from Ticonderoga on the 18th of February 1813, headed northwestward,
guided by little but the compass. Thirty miles that day they made in spite of piercing blasts
and driving snow. But with the night there began a terrible storm with winds of zero chill.
The air was filled with stinging, cutting snow. When they rose at daylight they were nearly
buried in drifts, although their camp was in a dense, sheltered thicket. Guided wholly by the
compass they travelled again, but blinded by the whirling white they stumbled and blundered
into endless difficulties and made but poor headway. After dragging the toboggan for three
hours, taking turns at breaking the way, they were changing places when Rolf noticed a large
gray patch on Quonab's cheek and nose.

"Quonab, your face is frozen," he said.

"So is yours," was the reply.

Now they turned aside, followed a hollow until they reached a spruce grove, where they camped
and took an observation, to learn that the compass and they held widely different views about
the direction of travel. It was obviously useless to face the storm. They rubbed out their
frozen features with dry snow and rested by the fire.

No good scout seeks for hardship; he avoids the unnecessary trial of strength and saves himself
for the unavoidable. With zero weather about them and twenty-four hours to wait in the storm,
the scouts set about making themselves thoroughly comfortable.

With their snowshoes they dug away the snow in a circle a dozen feet across, piling it up on
the outside so as to make that as high as possible. When they were down to the ground, the
wall of snow around them was five feet high. Now they went forth with the hatchets, cut many
small spruces, and piled them against the living spruces about the camp till there was a dense
mass of evergreen foliage ten feet high around them, open only at the top, where was a space
five feet across. With abundance of dry spruce wood, a thick bed of balsam boughs, and plenty
of blankets they were in what most woodmen consider comfort complete.

They had nothing to do now but wait. Quonab sat placidly smoking, Rolf was sewing a rent in
his coat, the storm hissed, and the wind-driven ice needles rattled through the trees to vary
the crackle of the fire with a "siss" as they fell on the embers. The low monotony of sound
was lulling in its evenness, when a faint crunch of a foot on the snow was heard. Rolf reached
for his gun, the fir tree screen was shaken a little, and a minute later there bounded in upon
them the snow covered form of little dog Skookum, expressing his good-will by excessive sign
talk in which every limb and member had a part. They had left him behind, indeed, but not with
his consent, so the bargain was incomplete.

There was no need to ask now, What shall we do with him? Skookum had settled that, and why
or how he never attempted to explain.

He was wise who made it law that "as was his share who went forth to battle, so shall his be
that abode with the stuff," for the hardest of all is the waiting. In the morning there was
less doing in the elemental strife. There were even occasional periods of calm and at length
it grew so light that surely the veil was breaking.

Quonab returned from a brief reconnoitre to say, "Ugh!--good going."

The clouds were broken and flying, the sun came out at times, but the wind was high, the cold
intense, and the snow still drifting. Poor Skookum had it harder than the men, for they wore
snowshoes; but he kept his troubles to himself and bravely trudged along behind. Had he been
capable of such reflection he might have said, "What delightful weather, it keeps the fleas
so quiet."

That day there was little to note but the intense cold, and again both men had their cheeks
frost-bitten on the north side. A nook under an overhanging rock gave a good camp that night.
Next day the bad weather resumed, but, anxious to push on they faced it, guided chiefly by
the wind. It was northwest, and as long as they felt this fierce, burning cold mercilessly
gnawing on their hapless tender right cheek bones, they knew they were keeping their proper
main course.

They were glad indeed to rest at dusk and thaw their frozen faces. Next day at dawn they were
off; at first it was calm, but the surging of the snow waves soon began again, and the air
was filled with the spray of their lashing till it was hard to see fifty yards in any direction.
They were making very bad time. The fourth day should have brought them to Ogdensburg, but
they were still far off; how far they could only guess, for they had not come across a house
or a settler.

Chapter 69. Ogdensburg

The same blizzard was raging on the next day when Skookum gave unequivocal sign talk that he
smelled something.

It is always well to find out what stirs your dog. Quonab looked hard at Skookum. That sagacious
mongrel was sniffing vigorously, up in the air, not on the ground; his mane was not bristling,
and the patch of dark hair that every gray or yellow dog has at the base of his tail, was not
lifted.

"He smells smoke," was the Indian's quick diagnosis. Rolf pointed Up the wind and made the
sign-talk query. Quonab nodded.

It was their obvious duty to find out who was their smoky neighbour. They were now not so far
from the St. Lawrence; there was a small chance of the smoke being from a party of the enemy;
there was a large chance of it being from friends; and the largest chance was that it came
from some settler's cabin where they could get necessary guidance.

They turned aside. The wind now, instead of on the right cheek, was square in their faces.
Rolf went forward increasing his pace till he was as far ahead as was possible without being
out of sight. After a mile their way led downward, the timber was thicker, the wind less, and
the air no more befogged with flying snow. Rolf came to a long, deep trench that wound among
the trees; the snow at the bottom of it was very hard. This was what he expected; the trail
muffled under new, soft snow, but still a fresh trail and leading to the camp that Skookum
had winded.

He turned and made the sign for them to halt and wait. Then strode cautiously along the winding
guide line.

In twenty minutes the indications of a settlement increased, and the scout at length was peering
from the woods across the open down to a broad stream on whose bank was a saw mill, with the
usual wilderness of ramshackle shanties, sheds, and lumber piles about.

There was no work going on, which was a puzzle till Rolf remembered it was Sunday. He went
boldly up and asked for the boss. His whole appearance was that of a hunter and as such the
boss received him.

He was coming through from the other side and had missed his way in the storm, he explained.

"What are ye by trade?"

"A trapper."

"Where are ye bound now?"

"Well, I'll head for the nearest big settlement, whatever that is."

"It's just above an even thing between Alexandria Bay and Ogdensburg."

So Rolf inquired fully about the trail to Alexandria Bay that he did not want to go to. Why
should he be so careful? The mill owner was clearly a good American, but the scout had no right
to let any outsider know his business. This mill owner might be safe, but he might be unwise
and blab to some one who was not all right.

Then in a casual way he learned that this was the Oswegatchie River and thirty miles down he
would find the town of Ogdensburg.

No great recent events did he hear of, but evidently the British troops across the river were
only awaiting the springtime before taking offensive measures.

For the looks of it, Rolf bought some tea and pork, but the hospitable mill man refused to
take payment and, leaving in the direction of Alexandria Bay, Rolf presently circled back and
rejoined his friends in the woods.

A long detour took them past the mill. It was too cold for outdoor idling. Every window was
curtained with frost, and not a soul saw them as they tramped along past the place and down
to continue on the ice of the Oswegatchie.

Pounded by the ceaseless wind, the snow on the ice was harder, travel was easier, and the same
tireless blizzard wiped out the trail as soon as it was behind them.

Crooked is the river trail, but good the footing, and good time was made. When there was a
north reach, the snow was extra hard or the ice clear and the scouts slipped off their snow
shoes, and trotted at a good six-mile gait. Three times they halted for tea and rest, but the
fact that they were the bearers of precious despatches, the bringers of inspiring good news,
and their goal ever nearer, spurred them on and on. It was ten o'clock that morning when they
left the mill, some thirty miles from Ogdensburg. It was now near sundown, but still they figured
that by an effort they could reach the goal that night. It was their best day's travel, but
they were nerved to it by the sense of triumph as they trotted; and the prospective joy of
marching up to the commandant and handing over the eagerly looked for, reassuring documents,
gave them new strength and ambition. Yes! they must push on at any price that night. Day was
over now; Rolf was leading at a steady trot. In his hand he held the long trace of his toboggan,
ten feet behind was Quonab with the short trace, while Skookum trotted before, beside, or behind,
as was dictated by his general sense of responsibility.

It was quite dark now. There was no moon, the wooded shore was black. Their only guide was
the broad, wide reach of the river, sometimes swept bare of snow by the wind, but good travelling
at all times. They were trotting and walking in spells, going five miles an hour; Quonab was
suffering, but Rolf was young and eager to finish. They rounded another reach, they were now
on the last big bend, they were reeling off the miles; only ten more, and Rolf was so stirred
that, instead of dropping to the usual walk on signal at the next one hundred yards spell,
he added to his trot. Quonab, taken unawares, slipped and lost his hold of the trace. Rolf
shot ahead and a moment later there was the crash of a breaking air-hole, and Rolf went through
the ice, clutched at the broken edge and disappeared, while the toboggan was dragged to the hole.

Quonab sprung to his feet, and then to the lower side of the hole. The toboggan had swung to
the same place and the long trace was tight; without a moment's delay the Indian hauled at
it steadily, heavily, and in a few seconds the head of his companion reappeared; still clutching
that long trace he was safely dragged from the ice-cold flood, blowing and gasping, shivering
and sopping, but otherwise unhurt.

Now here a new danger presented itself. The zero wind would soon turn his clothes to boards.
They stiffened in a few minutes, and the Indian knew that frozen hands and feet were all too
easy in frozen clothes.

He made at once for the shore, and, seeking the heart of a spruce thicket, lost no time in
building two roaring fires between which Rolf stood while the Indian made the bed, in which,
as soon as he could be stripped, the lad was glad to hide. Warm tea and warm blankets made
him warm, but it would take an hour or two to dry his clothes. There is nothing more damaging
than drying them too quickly. Quonab made racks of poles and spent the next two hours in regulating
the fire, watching the clothes, and working the moccasins.

It was midnight when they were ready and any question of going on at once was settled by Quonab.
"Ogdensburg is under arms," he said. "It is not wise to approach by night."

At six in the morning they were once more going, stiff with travel, sore-footed, face-frozen,
and chafed by delay; but, swift and keen, trotting and walking, they went. They passed several
settlements, but avoided them. At seven-thirty they had a distant glimpse of Ogdensburg and
heard the inspiring roll of drums, and a few minutes later from the top of a hill they had
a complete view of the heroic little town to see--yes! plainly enough--that the British flag
was flying from the flag pole.

Chapter 70. Saving the Despatches

Oh, the sickening shock of it! Rolf did not know till now how tired he was, how eager to deliver
the heartening message, and to relax a little from the strain. He felt weak through and through.
There could be no doubt that a disaster had befallen his country's arms.

His first care was to get out of sight with his sled and those precious despatches.

Now what should he do? Nothing till he had fuller information. He sent Quonab back with the
sled, instructing him to go to a certain place two miles off, there camp out of sight and wait.

Then he went in alone. Again and again he was stung by the thought, "If I had come sooner they
might have held out."

A number of teams gathered at the largest of a group of houses on the bank suggested a tavern.
He went in and found many men sitting down to breakfast. He had no need to ask questions. It
was the talk of the table. Ogdensburg had been captured the day before. The story is well known.
Colonel MacDonnell with his Glengarry Highlanders at Prescott went to drill daily on the ice
of the St. Lawrence opposite Ogdensburg. Sometimes they marched past just out of range, sometimes
they charged and wheeled before coming too near. The few Americans that held the place watched
these harmless exercises and often cheered some clever manceuvre. They felt quite safe behind
their fortification. By an unwritten agreement both parties refrained from firing random shots
at each other. There was little to suggest enemies entrenched; indeed, many men in each party
had friends in the other, and the British had several times trotted past within easy range,
without provoking a shot.

On February 22d, the day when Rolf and Quonab struck the Oswegatchie, the British colonel directed
his men as usual, swinging them ever nearer the American fort, and then, at the nearest point,
executed a very pretty charge. The Americans watched it as it neared, but instead of wheeling
at the brink the little army scrambled up with merry shouts, and before the garrison could
realize that this was war, they were overpowered and Ogdensburg was taken.

The American commander was captured. Captain Forsyth, the second in command, had been off on
a snowshoe trip, so had escaped. All the rest were prisoners, and what to do with the despatches
or how to get official instructions was now a deep problem. "When you don't know a thing to
do, don't do a thing," was one of Si Sylvanne's axioms; also, "In case of doubt lay low and
say nothing." Rolf hung around the town all day waiting for light. About noon a tall, straight,
alert man in a buffalo coat drove up with a cutter. He had a hasty meal in an inside room.
Rolf sized him up for an American officer, but there was a possibility of his being a Canadian.
Rolf tried in vain to get light on him but the inner door was kept closed; the landlord was
evidently in the secret. When he came out he was again swaddled in the buffalo coat. Rolf brushed
past him--here was something hard and long in the right pocket of the big coat.

The landlord, the guest, and the driver had a whispered conference. Rolf went as near as he
dared, but got only a searching look. The driver spoke to another driver and Rolf heard the
words "Black Lake." Yes, that was what he suspected. Black Lake was on the inland sleigh route
to Alexandria Bay and Sackett's Harbour.

The driver, a fresh young fellow, was evidently interested in the landlord's daughter; the
stranger was talking with the landlord. As soon as they had parted, Rolf went to the latter
and remarked quietly: "The captain is in a hurry." The only reply was a cold look and: "Guess
that's his business." So it was the captain. The driver's mitts were on the line back of the
stove. Rolf shook them so that they fell in a dark corner. The driver missed his mitts, and
glad of a chance went back in, leaving the officer alone. "Captain Forsyth," whispered Rolf,
"don't go till I have talked with you. I'll meet you a mile down the road."

"Who are you and what do you want?" was the curt and hostile reply, evidently admitting the
identification correct however.

Rolf opened his coat and showed his scout badge.

"Why not talk now if you have any news--come in side." So the two went to the inner room. "Who
is this?" asked Rolf cautiously as the landlord came in.

"He's all right. This is Titus Flack, the landlord."

"How am I to know that?"

"Haven't you heard him called by name all day?" said the captain.

Flack smiled, went out and returned with his license to sell liquor, and his commission as
a magistrate of New York State. The latter bore his own signature. He took a pen and reproduced
it. Now the captain threw back his overcoat and stood in the full uniform of an army officer.
He opened his satchel and took out a paper, but Rolf caught sight of another packet addressed
to General Hampton. The small one was merely a map. "I think that packet in there is meant
for me," remarked Rolf.

"We haven't seen your credentials yet," said the officer. " Should say' t was a mud- turtle by the looks
of his legs," said Bob."

Nurth, do turtle- doves live in the mud?" said Pip."

Nonsense," said Bob," as if birds ever lived in the mud!""

Well," said Pip," thum thwallows, I know, make their neths of mud,
and then they live in their neths, and that' s living in mud.

But here comth the Profethor; let' s see what heeth found. It' s
thumthin in a glath."

The Professor came up, walking very slowly across the grass; then stepped carefully up upon the
piazza, and, as he passed the window, he called for some one to come
and open the front door.

All the children ran together, and opened the door with such a flourish,
the Professor was obliged to call out," Stand off!

Hands off!""

Will it splode?" said Pip."

Will it bite?" said Bob."

Will it fly away?" said Tom."

It will splode," said the Professor," and? I never heard of any creature
splodin!"

The Professor looked pleased; his face was red, his hair was tumbled,
his coat was torn, and his boots and trousers were muddy."

You look as if you had had a hard time catching the creature, whatever it
is," said nurse."

You' d better leave it out- of- doors now, and clean yourself, and come
and eat your luncheon.""

Oh, please, nurse nurse, who wanted to see it herself, agreed."
You can' t see it," said the Professor;" it' s invisible!

You can' t see it till it disappears!"" Oh dear," said Pip," I just ache to know about it.""
Well," said the Professor," light mamma' s wax- taper.""

I don' t see obtained with great difficulty. I' ve been about it ever
since lesson- time.""

Where did you find it?" says Pip."

How came you to know about it?" says Tom."

I begetting should think it would be hard to catch nothing," says
Bob."

I found it in the water, in the little pool in our woods.

I saw it first the a long stick and gently stirred up the dead leaves
that lie rotting on the bottom, and he began to come up-- first one,
then another-- now here, and now there.""

Ho! ho!" says Bob." How could that be?

How could he come up in pieces, and in different places?"" as Poor
thing!" said Pip."

He wath dead!"" Oh, if he' s dead I don' t care about him," says Bob."
He' s far from dead," said the Professor;" and though he was in pieces,
he' s all together now, and safe in this tumbler."

And then, seizing the lighted taper, he turned up the tumbler, held
the taper quickly to its mouth, and-- Pop! went something, with a
quick flash."

Oh, fire- works!" says Bob."

Oh, tell us truly about it!" says Tom."

Where did you buy it? Let' s have some for the Fourth!""

Children," said the Professor," I have told you the truth about it.

It' s gas. It' s carbureted hydrogen. I found it in the pond.' Carbureted hydrogen' is its science name.
Its poetry name is' Will- o'- the- wisp,' and there' s another name besides."" I should think two
names were enough for nothing," says Bob."

What' th the other name?" said Pip."

Ignis fatuus," said the Professor."

It means' Cheating- fire.' Sometimes this gas, rising to the top
of the water in bubbles, takes fire( by what they call spontaneous
combustion, or by mixing with some other gas, or in some other way),
if some one were walking through the woods with a lantern.""

And thath how it cheat- th, isn' t it?" said Pip."

But I don' t thee how it?" continued is thet afire.

Perhapth, now-- perhapth it' s the fire- flyth!"" Oh, good for you!" said
the Professor; and he chased her round the table, and caught her, and kissed her
was then full of water, and though the tumbler was upside down the water
couldn' t fall out.""

What hindered it, I' d like to know?" said Bob."

Atmospheric pressure," said the Professor, pushing the words out slowly."
The whole atmosphere weighs down on the water in the saucer and balances
the water in the tumbler and keeps it in.""

It had all leaked out before you reached home, anyway," said Bob." The gas pushed it out," said the Professor,"
I told you how I stirred up the bottom of the pool. It was all covered dead leaves. These as they rot give
out gas, but it cannot easily escape from the bottom of, and stays
down among the leaves and slime till it is stirred up.

Then the little bubbles of gas come popping up, and as they mount
I am ready with my tumbler and saucer.

I slip them both softly into the water a little way off, draw out
the saucer, slide the inverted tumbler over the bubbles before they
break; and the gas mounts into the tumbler, each bubble of gas displacing
a little water; then over more bubbles, and more and more, until all
the water in the tumbler is out and the gas is in its place; then
I fill the saucer with water again, slide it under the tumbler, and
bring it home.""

Come to your luncheon, children," cried nurse." The pudding will be cold.""
Oh, wait a minute," said Tom." You said the gas drove out the water
in the tumbler. Why don' t it drive out the water in the saucer?" The
Professor looked puzzled." Well, it would in time, I suppose. But
you see, its nature is to push upward, because it' s light----"" Oh,
now, it pushes the same every way," said Tom."

There' s something we don' t know," said Bob." Oh, yeth, I am afwaid
we don' t know it all," said Pip."

Well," drawled the don' t know, only I guess it' s because the water
is too dense-- too close together, for one thing; and the same atmospheric
pressing that kept the water in keeps the gas in, for another.""

There, I do believe that' s it," said Pip." Oh, how nice it did pop
off! Like a vewy small fwier- cracker a great way off.

Now let' s have some pudding. Apple and sago!

Just the nithest pudding in the world!" One day an ant went to visit her
neighbor; She found her quite busy with all sorts of labor; glide along, Naught
ruffles up the temper of your mind; All goes as smoothly as a summer
song, All objects flit beside you like the wind.

But if you should be stopped in your career, And forced to linger when you fain would fly, You' ll
leave my first, and, very much I fear, Will fall into my second speedily.

Till in some snug and comfortable room Your friends receive you as
a welcome guest, You' ll own that Winter' s robbed of half his gloom,
When on whole your feet in slippers rest. sacrificial II.

MY FIRST. I sunder friends, yet give to laws A place to stand and plead their cause. Though justice
and sobriety Still find their safest ground in, I spread temptation
in man' s way, And rob and ruin every day.

MY SECOND. Success and power are in my name, Men strive for me far
more than fame.

One thing I am unto the wise, But quite another in fools' eyes, Through
me the world is rich and strong, Yet too much love of me is wrong.

MY WHOLE.

My first and second when they meet, As lawyers' fees, my whole complete. And yet my first too oft enjoyed, Is
sure to make my second void.

My whole is good and bad by turns, As every merchant daily learns. III. My first the stout Hibernian wields
On banks and streets and stubborn fields, To earn the bread that labor yields. My second is a name for one
Whose youth and age together run, A leader all good people shun. My whole

WISE CATHERINE AND THE KABOUTERMANNEKEN. BY HOWARD PYLE.

In old
times, there was once a quaint little dwarf, who was known as the
Kaboutermanneken of Kaboutermannekensburg.

In the very ancient times of good King Broderic and Frederic Barbarossa,
he constantly lived above ground, and many times was seen trudging
along through the moonlit forest with a bag over his shoulder.

What was in the bag nobody exactly knew, but most people supposed
it to be gold.

The Kaboutermanneken was a peppery little fellow, and at the slightest
word his rage would fire up hotly. Since he was quite able, small
as he was, to thrash the strongest man, he was very generally avoided.
It is a well- assured fact that, as churches increase, dwarfs and
elfin- folk diminish; so, at last, when the town of Kaboutermannekensburg
was founded, and a church built, the Kaboutermanneken was fairly driven
to the wall, or, rather, into the ground, where he lived in the bowels
of the earth, and only appeared at intervals of a hundred years.

But, upon the last day that terminated each of these series of a
hundred years, he would re- appear in his old haunts, and, I believe,
continues the practice to the present day, in spite of railroads,
steam- engines, and all the paraphernalia of progress, so destructive
to fairy lore.

I.-- THE GOLDEN CUP. Once upon a time, after the Kaboutermanneken' s
visits had become events of such rarity, there lived a worthy wood- chopper,
who had a daughter named Catherine; a pretty little maiden of sixteen,
and yet the wisest woman in the kingdom of Kaboutermannekensburg.
had borrowed from a kind neighbor, she threw a shawl around her head
and started off in the direction of Castle Dunderhead, where her fears
told her only too plainly her father was.

The bars of Shrewd as she was, she had yet the best, the kindest, and the
most guileless heart in the world; and many a sick man, troubled
woman, and grieved child had cause to bless her and, let' s see it
now!" said all the children; and her wisdom.

One winter, when labor was cheap and bread expensive, the wood- chopper,
whose name was Peter Kurtz, chopped his hand instead of the stump
he was aiming a blow at, and, in consequence, rendered himself unfit
for work for many a day.

During his sickness, the whole care of the family devolved upon Kate;
for Peter' s wife had died nearly two years before; so it was Kate
who tended the baby, dressed Johann, mended Wilhelm' s small- clothes,
and attended to the wants of her what good lighting a taper will do,
if the creature' s invisible," said Bob.

The Professor set his burden down on the table.

It was a saucer filled with water, and in the water stood a tumbler upside
down. There was nothing to be seen in the tumbler. The Professor struck
an attitude."

What I have in this tumbler, nurse and children, was father; for in those days a sick man was more
complaining than a child two years old.

Beside these acts of labor, she had to cook the meals, wash the dishes,
sweep the house, run of errands, chop the wood, make the fire, and
many other little odd duties of the kind; thus that, upon the whole,
her time was pretty well occupied.

There seemed a probability now, however, that one of these duties
would be dispensed with, namely, cooking the meals; not that there
was any indolence upon Catherine' s part, but because the necessary
materials were not forthcoming.

Indeed, the extent of the larder at present consisted of half a bowl
of cold gravy, and about a quarter of a loaf of bread.

When Catherine, that cold morning, inspected the woeful emptiness of the cupboard, she wrung her cold
blue hands in despair; but, wring her poor little hands ever so much,
she could not squeeze good bread and meat out of them; something must
be done, and that immediately, if she would save the children from
starving.

At length she bethought herself that many rich people of Kaboutermannekensburg
were fond of burning pine- cones instead of rough logs, not only on
account of the bright, warm and crackling fire they produced, but
also because of the sweet resinous odor that they threw out, filling
the house with a perfume like that which arose from the censers in
the cathedral.

It was woeful weather for Catherine to go hunting for pine- cones. The snow lay a good foot deep
over the glossy brown treasures, and she herself was but thinly clad; yet the children must have bread.
Not having eaten any breakfast that morning, she slipped the remnant
of the loaf into the basket to serve as lunch, and then started to
face the wind toward the forest.

Bitterly cold blew the wind from the bleak north; tearing through
the moaning pine forest, that tossed and swayed before the tempest,
gnawing Catherine' s nose and fingers, and snatching up, as it were,
handfuls of snow, and hurling them in a rage through the air.

Poor Catherine was nearly frozen, yet she struggled bravely on through the
drifting snow.

Suddenly she caught sight of a quaint little cottage that she had
never seen before, much as she had traveled this portion of the forest;
but a more welcome sight still was the gleam of a cheery fire within,
Peter, humbly."

You are deceiving me," said the baron, sternly.

Then, fixing his eye gave a dreadful scream, And roused the house; they
brought in lights, and put my whole to flight, Since then I made
a vow to eat no supper late at night.[ A] The answers will be given
in the"

Letter- Box" for upon poor Peter," Where did you get that cup?" said he,
abruptly."

Me- thinks you are rather a poor man to possess such a treasure.""

Oh,
good my lord!" cried poor Peter," I will tell you that illuminated the
frost- covered panes with a glow.

Catherine, stumbling, sliding, struggling through the drifts, reached
the cottage at last, raised the latch, and entered a door- way so
low that even she, small as she was, had to stoop her head in passing."

Shut the door!" shrieked a shrill voice, with startling abruptness; and, for the first time, Kate
perceived a very little old man seated in a very large chair, and
smoking a very long pipe.

A great beard reached below his dangling feet and touched the floor."
May I warm myself at your fire, kind gentleman?" said Kate, dropping
a courtesy.

The little old man grunted without looking at her." May I warm myself
at your fire, sir?" repeated Kate, in a louder voice, supposing he
must be deaf." I heard you!" it will fly away; but it won' t bite.""
Oh my!" said Pip," what can it be growled the old dwarf, with sudden
rage."

You don' t suppose I' m deaf, do you? I said yes. You don' t want to argue, do you?" Kate murmured
her thanks, feeling much astonished and very uncomfortable at the
Professor," I old gentleman' s conduct. Thus they sat in silence for
a long while, the little old man smoking like a volcano.

At length:" Are you hungry?" said he, abruptly."

Yes, sir," said Kate, bethinking herself of her bread."

So am I!" said the old man, shortly, at the same time resuming his
smoking.

Removing his pipe after another pause," I haven' t had anything to eat for
one hundred years; I feel kind of," said he."

I should think so," thought Kate to herself; then, after regarding him in silence for a few
minutes, she said, timidly," I-- I have a-- a piece of bread in
my basket, sir, if you would like to have it?""

Like to have it? You speak as though you had no sense. Of course,
I should like to have it!

Why didn' t you offer it to me sooner?" Kate, in spite of her hunger, that had recommenced gnawing
her, now that she was warm, handed him the piece of bread. The old man seized it ravenously, opened
his mouth to an astonishing extent, bolted the large morsel as one
does a pill, and then resumed his smoking as though nothing of any
note had occurred.

Kate regarded him with silent astonishment." What are you doing out in this kind of weather?" said the
old man, suddenly." I came to gather pine- cones to sell in the town,"
said Kate." You' re a fool!" snapped the old man." How do you suppose
you can gather pine- cones in twelve inches of snow, not to mention the
drifts?""

Nevertheless, sir, I have to get the children something to eat, and father----"" Oh! don' t bother
me with that story!" said the old man, impatiently." I know all about it. Your father' s Peter Kurtz,
isn' t he?"" Yes, sir."" Umph!" grunted the dwarf.

Then, after another pause," go to the closet yonder, and take one
of the cups there, in return for the bread you gave me.""

Indeed, sir," said Kate, earnestly," I do not care for any return for----""
Do as I tell you!" bellowed the other night in the dark, and I caught
it to- day when it was hiding. I took dwarf, in a fury. Kate crossed the
room, opened the cupboard, and-- what a sight met her eyes!

All the dishes, bowls, cups and saucers were of pure gold." Take one of the cups?" said Kate, in breathless
doubt." That' s what I said, wasn' t it?" snarled the dwarf." You are
just like all women, So she didn' t go in, but stopped at the sill; Left
her respects, and went back to her hill. FOUR CHARADES.[ A] BY C. P. CRANCH.
I. When swiftly in my first you never contented with what you receive." Catherine
was far too wise to answer foolish abuse with useless excuse; she silently
took one of the beautiful cups and put it in her basket. She was so
overcome that she did not think of any word of thanks until she had
reached the door; then, turning:" May heaven bless you, sir, for----"" Shut
the door!" screamed the dwarf. Kate hurried home, but before reaching
the town she wisely covered the cup with snow, that no gossiping
neighbor might catch sight of it; for she well knew that gossip was
like the snow- ball that the little boys start rolling from the top
of a hill-- small in the commencement, but sure to grow before it
ends its course."

Where have you been all this time?" whined Peter. When Kate recounted her adventure, her father could hardly
believe her, and when she had carefully removed the snow from the cup, he could hardly believe his eyes.
He placed it upon the table, and then, sitting down in front of it,
he examined it with breathless astonishment and delight.

The cup was of solid gold, heavy and massive; carved upon it in bold relief was a group of figures
representing a host of little elves at a banquet. So exquisitely were they engraved that they appeared
actually to move, and it seemed as though one could almost hear their laughter and talk. A glittering,
carved golden snake, curled around the brim of the cup, served as
a handle; its eyes were two diamonds.

After Peter Kurtz had feasted his eyes upon this treasure for a long time,
he arose suddenly, and, without saying a word, wrapped up the cup
in a napkin, drew his cowl more closely around his face, and, taking
his staff, prepared to leave the house." Where are you going, father?"
said Kate."

I am going," said Peter," to take this cup to our master, the do, father!" said Kate, quickly." I foresee
that danger will come of it, if you fulfill your intention."" Bah!" said Peter, and, without deigning
another word, he marched out of the house; for Peter, like a great many
men in those days, had a very poor opinion of the feminine intellect,
and a very good opinion of his own.

So off he marched boldly toward castle Dunderhead.

When Peter presented the golden cup to the baron, with a low bow, that nobleman could not find sufficient
words to express his admiration. He sighed with
rapture, and examined the cup from every side with the utmost minuteness."
Give this worthy man," said he," four bags of guilders; money is nothing
to the acquisition of such a treasure of beauty."

Here Peter secretly hugged himself, and chuckled at his daughter'
s warning. Meanwhile, the baron examined the cup with huge satisfaction.
Suddenly turning to Peter," Where is the saucer?" said he." The saucer?"
repeated Peter, blankly." Please you, my lord, it never had a saucer!""

Never had a saucer?"
repeated the baron." You don Baron von Dunderhead; that will be far
more to our advantage than selling it to some petty goldsmith or other.""
Take care what you' t mean to tell me that such a cup as that was ever
made without a saucer to go with it!"" Nevertheless, my lord, I have
no saucer," said the whole truth. An old man in the forest gave it
to my daughter Kate.""

Do you expect me to believe such a story as that?" exclaimed the baron."
You stole it, you thief!" he roared, at the same time seizing Peter
by the collar." Ho! guards! Arrest this man, and throw him into the
dungeon," cried he to his attendants."

Mercy! mercy, my lord!." Well, how did you ever get it with that tumbler?"
said Tom." Well, easy enough. First, I filled the tumbler with water. Then
I laid the saucer over the top. Then I plunged the whole under the water
holding tumbler and saucer with both hands firm, and turned them
over in the water, and drew them out.

The saucer, as well as the tumbler," cried poor Peter, falling on his
knees.

But the guards dragged him off in
spite of his cries, and popped him into a dungeon, where he was left
to meditate over his folly in not heeding his daughter' s advice.

II.-- THE GOOSE THAT WAS TO LAY THE GOLDEN EGG. Catherine waited
anxiously for her father' s return, but her fears told her all when
night came and he came not.

After she had put the children to bed, having given them each a piece of bread,
which she the dungeon windows came upon a level with the ground,
like those of a cellar."

Father!" murmured Catherine." Oh, Kate!" was the response, followed immediately
by the sound of violent crying, and Catherine knew her father was there."
Oh, Kate! if I-- I had but l- listened to you!" sobbed the poor fellow;
for, now that the discovery was too late avail him, he felt perfectly
sure of his daughter' s superior intelligence.

Then, with much sobbing, he recounted all the particulars of his
interview with the baron."

Can' t you do something to get your poor old father out he.

Kate was thoughtful for a moment." I' ll try, and then, as one bubble
after another takes fire and goes flickering along, it looks as father,"
said she, at length; and, bidding him a hasty adieu, she hurried off.

She ran, without stopping, to where the little cottage
stood in the forest; but, as you have already probably guessed, the
old man was the Kaboutermanneken, his day' s visit was over, and he
had descended once more into the obscurity of the earth; consequently
Catherine, much to her perplexity, could not discover the little cottage.

After vainly seeking for some time, she at length saw the hopelessness
of her task, and wended was her way sorrowfully homeward.

She lay awake nearly all night, vainly cudgeling her brains for some
plan by which to deliver her father from his confinement.

At length an idea occurred to her, and, smiling to herself, she turned
on her pillow and fell asleep until the sun shining in her eyes awakened
her.

Then, arising, she donned her best frock
and neatest cap, and proceeded to the Castle Dunderhead. She was directly
presented to the baron." My lord!" said she, falling upon her knees." Well,
my pretty damsel," said he; for Kate looked very sweet in her saucy
cap."

My lord," continued she, and the tears rose to her eyes as she spoke;"
you have my father in custody.""

Ha!" exclaimed the baron, frowning,--;" Peter Kurtz?""

Yes, my lord."" Bring forth Peter Kurtz!" cried the baron to the guard, and soon Peter
made his appearance, crying like a good fellow

.


"Then prepare to start as soon as possible for Fort George and Albany. Do you want a mate?"

"I should like a paddler as far as Fort George."

"Well, pick your man."

"Quonab."

And when they set out, for the first time Rolf was in the stern, the post of guidance and command.
So once more the two were travelling again with Skookum in the bow. It was afternoon when they
started and the four-mile passage of the creek was slow, but down the long, glorious vista
of the noble George they went at full canoe-flight, five miles an hour, and twenty-five miles
of the great fair-way were reeled and past when they lighted their nightly fire.

At dawn-cry of the hawk they sped away, and in spite of a rising wind they made six miles in
two hours.

As they approached the familiar landing of Van Trumper's farm, Skookum began to show a most
zestful interest that recalled the blackened pages of his past. "Quonab, better use that,"
and Rolf handed a line with which Skookum was secured and thus led to make a new record, for
this was the first time in his life that he landed at Van Trumper's without sacrificing a chicken
in honour of the joyful occasion.

They entered the house as the family were sitting down to breakfast.

"Mein Hemel! mein Hemel! It is Rolf and Quonab; and vere is dot tam dog? Marta, vere is de
chickens? Vy, Rolf, you bin now a giant, yah. Mein Gott, it is I am glad! I did tink der cannibals
you had eat; is it dem Canadian or cannibal? I tink it all one the same, yah!"

Marta was actually crying, the little ones were climbing over Rolf's knee, and Annette, tall
and sixteen now, stood shyly by, awaiting a chance to shake hands. Home is the abiding place
of those we love; it may be a castle or a cave, a shanty or a chateau, a moving van, a tepee,
or a canal boat, a fortress or the shady side of a bush, but it is home, if there indeed we
meet the faces that are ever in the heart, and find the hands whose touch conveys the friendly
glow. Was there any other spot on earth where he could sit by the fire and feel that "hereabout
are mine own, the people I love?" Rolf knew it now--Van Trumper's was his home.

Talks of the war, of disasters by land, and of glorious victories on the sea, where England,
long the unquestioned mistress of the waves, had been humbled again and again by the dauntless
seamen of her Western blood; talks of big doings by the nation, and, yet more interesting,
small doings by the travellers, and the breakfast passed all too soon. The young scout rose,
for he was on-duty, but the long rollers on the lake forbade the going forth. Van's was a pleasant
place to wait, but he chafed at the delay; his pride would have him make a record on every
journey. But wait he must. Skookum tied safely to his purgatorial post whined indignantly--and
with head cocked on one side, picked out the very hen he would like to utilize--as soon as
released from his temporary embarrassment. Quonab went out on a rock to bum some tobacco and
pray for calm, and Rolf, ever active, followed Van to look over the stock and buildings, and
hear of minor troubles. The chimney was unaccountably given to smoking this year. Rolf took
an axe and with two blows cut down a vigorous growth shrubbery that stood above the chimney
on the west, and the smoking ceased. Buck ox had a lame foot and would allow no one even to
examine it. But a skilful ox-handler easily hobbles an ox, throws him near some small tree,
and then, by binding the lame foot to the tree, can have a free hand. It proved a simple matter,
a deep-sunk, rusty nail. And when the nail was drawn and the place washed clean with hot brine,
kind nature was left in confidence to do the rest. They drifted back to the house now. Tomas
met them shouting out a mixture of Dutch and English and holding by the cover Annette's book
of the "Good Girl." But its rightful owner rescued the precious volume and put it on the shelf.

"Have you read it through, Annette?"

"Yes," was the reply, for she had learned to read before they left Schuylerville.

"How do you like it?"

"Didn't like it a bit; I like 'Robinson Crusoe'," was the candid reply.

The noon hour came, still the white rollers were pounding the shore.

"If it does not calm by one o'clock I'll go on afoot."

So off he went with the packet, leaving Quonab to follow and await his return at Fort George.
In Schuyler settlement he spent the night and at noon next day was in Albany.

How it stirred his soul to see the busy interest, the marching of men, the sailing of vessels,
and above all to hear of more victories on the high seas. What mattered a few frontier defeats
in the north, when the arrogant foe that had spurned and insulted them before the world had
now been humbled again and again.

Young Van Cortlandt was away, but the governor's reception of him reflected the electric atmosphere--the
country's pride in her sons.

Rolf had a matter of his own to settle. At the bookseller's he asked for and actually secured
a copy of the great book--"Robinson Crusoe." It was with a thrilling feeling of triumph that
he wrote Annette's name in it and stowed it in his bag.

He left Albany next day in the gray dawn. Thanks to his uniform, he got a twenty-five mile
lift with a traveller who drove a fast team, and the blue water was glinting back the stars
when he joined Quonab at Fort George, some sixty miles away.

In the calm betwixt star-peep and sun-up they were afloat. It was a great temptation to stop
at Hendrik's for a spell, but breakfast was over, the water was calm, and duty called him.
He hallooed, then they drew near enough to hand the book ashore. Skookum growled, probably
at the hens, and the family waved their aprons as he sped on. Thirty miles of lake and four
miles of Ticonderoga Creek they passed and the packet was delivered in four days and three
hours since leaving.

The general smiled and his short but amply sufficient praise was merely, "You're a good 'un."

Chapter 75. Scouting in Canada

"Thar is two things," said Si Sylvanne to the senate, "that every national crisis is bound
to show up: first, a lot o' dum fools in command; second a lot o great commanders in the ranks.
An' fortunately before the crisis is over the hull thing is sure set right, and the men is
where they oughter be."

How true this was the nation was just beginning to learn. The fools in command were already
demonstrated, and the summer of 1813 was replete with additional evidence. May, June, and July
passed with many journeyings for Rolf and many times with sad news. The disasters at Stony
Creek, Beaver Dam, and Niagara were severe blows to the army on the western frontier. In June
on Lake Champlain the brave but reckless Lieutenant Sidney Smith had run his two sloops into
a trap. Thus the Growler and the Eagle were lost to the Americans, and strengthened by that
much the British navy on the lake.

Encouraged by these successes, the British north of Lake Champlain made raid after raid into
American territory, destroying what they could not carry off.

Rolf and Quonab were sent to scout in that country and if possible give timely notice of raiders
in force.

The Americans were averse to employing Indians in warfare; the British entertained no such
scruples and had many red-skinned allies. Quonab's case, however, was unusual, since he was
guaranteed by his white partner, and now he did good service, for he knew a little French and
could prowl among the settlers without anyone suspecting him of being an American scout.

Thus he went alone and travelled far. He knew the country nearly to Montreal and late in July
was lurking about Odletown, when he overheard scattered words of a conversation that made him
eager for more. "Colonel Murray--twelve hundred men--four hundred men--"

Meanwhile Rolf was hiding in the woods about La Colle Mill. Company after company of soldiers
he saw enter, until at least five hundred were there. When night came down, he decided to risk
a scarer approach. He left the woods and walked cautiously across the open lands about.

The hay had been cut and most of it drawn in, but there was in the middle of the field a hay-cock.
Rolf was near this when he heard sounds of soldiers from the mill. Soon large numbers came
out, carrying their blankets. Evidently there was not room for them in the mill, and they were
to camp on the field.

The scout began to retreat when sounds behind showed that another body of soldiers was approaching
from that direction and he was caught between the two. There was only one place to hide and
that was beneath the haycock. He lifted its edge and crawled under, but it was full of thistles
and brambles; indeed, that was why it was left, and he had the benefit of all the spines about him.

His heart beat fast as he heard the clank of arms and the trampling; they came nearer, then
the voices became more distinct. He heard unmistakable evidence too that both bodies were camping
for the night, and that he was nearly surrounded. Not knowing what move was best he kept quiet.
The men were talking aloud, then they began preparing their beds and he heard some one say,
"There's a hay-cock; bring some of that."

A soldier approached to get an armful of the hay, but sputtered out a chapter of malediction
as his bare hands touched the masses of thistle and briers. His companions laughed at his mishap.
He went to the fire and vowed he'd stick a brand in it and back he came with a burning stick.

Rolf was all ready to make a dash for his life as soon as the cover should take fire, and he
peered up into the soldier's face as the latter blew on the brand; but the flame had died,
the thistles were not dry, and the fire was a failure; so, growling again, the soldier threw
down the smoking stick and went away. As soon as he was safely afar, Rolf gathered a handful
of soil and covered the red embers.

It was a critical moment and his waiting alone had saved him.

Two soldiers came with their blankets and spread them near. For a time they smoked and talked.
One of them was short of tobacco; the other said, "Never mind, we'll get plenty in Plattsburg,"
and they guffawed.

Then he heard, "As soon as the colonel" and other broken phrases.

It was a most difficult place for Rolf; he was tormented with thistles in his face and down
his neck; he dared not change his position; and how long he must stay was a problem. He would
try to escape when all was still.

The nearer soldiers settled to rest now. All was very quiet when Rolf cautiously peeped forth
to see two dreadful things: first, a couple of sentries pacing up and down the edges of the
camp; second, a broad, brilliant, rising moon. How horrible that lovely orb could be Rolf never
before knew.

Now, what next? He was trapped in the middle of a military camp and undoubtedly La Colle Mill
was the rendezvous for some important expedition.

He had ample time to think it all over. Unless he could get away before day he would surely
be discovered. His uniform might save his life, but soldiers have an awkward, hasty way of
dealing summarily with a spy--then discovering too late that he was in uniform.

From time to time he peered forth, but the scene was unchanged--the sleeping regiment, the
pacing sentries, the ever-brightening moon. Then the guard was changed, and the sentries relieved
selected of all places for their beds, the bank beside the hay-cock. Again one of them went
to help himself to some hay for a couch; and again the comic anger as he discovered it to be
a bed of thorns. How thankful Rolf was for those annoying things that pricked his face and neck.

He was now hemmed in on every side and, not knowing what to do, did nothing. For a couple of
hours he lay still, then actually fell asleep. He was awakened by a faint rustling near his
head and peered forth to see a couple of field mice playing about.

The moon was very bright now, and the movements of the mice were plain; they were feeding on
the seeds of plants in the hay-cock, and from time to time dashed under--the hay. Then they
gambolled farther off and were making merry over a pod of wild peas when a light form came
skimming noiselessly over the field. There was a flash, a hurried rush, a clutch, a faint squeak,
and one of the mice was borne away in the claws of its feathered foe. The survivor scrambled
under the hay over Rolf's face and somewhere into hiding.

The night passed in many short naps. The bugle sounded at daybreak and the soldiers arose to
make breakfast. Again one approached to use a handful of hay for fire-kindler, and again the
friendly thistles did their part. More and more now his ear caught suggestive words and sounds--"Plattsburg"--"the
colonel"--etc.

The breakfast smelt wonderfully captivating--poor Rolf was famished. The alluring aroma of
coffee permeated the hay-cock. He had his dried meat, but his need was water; he was tormented
with thirst, and stiff and tortured; he was making the hardest fight of his life. It seemed
long, though doubtless it was less than half an hour before the meal was finished, and to Rolf's
relief there were sounds of marching and the noises were drowned in the distance.

By keeping his head covered with hay and slowly raising it, he was safe to take a look around.
It was a bright, sunny morning. The hay-cock, or thistle-cock, was one of several that had
been rejected. It was a quarter-mile from cover; the soldiers were at work cutting timber and
building a stockade around the mill; and, most dreadful to relate, a small dog was prowling
about, looking for scraps on the scene of the soldiers' breakfast. If that dog came near his
hiding-place, he knew the game was up. At such close quarters, you can fool a man but not a dog.

Fortunately the breakfast tailings proved abundant, and the dog went off to assist a friend
of his in making sundry interesting smell analyses along the gate posts of the stockade.

Chapter 76. The Duel

This was temporary relief, but left no suggestion of complete escape. He lay there till nearly
noon suffering more and more from the cramped position and thirst, and utterly puzzled as to
the next move.

"When ye don't like whar ye air, git up without any fuss, and go whar ye want to be," was what
Sylvanne once said to him, and it came to Rolf with something like a comic shock. The soldiers
were busy in the woods and around the forges. In half an hour it would be noon and they might
come back to eat.

Rolf rose without attempting any further concealment, then stopped, made a bundle of the stuff
that had sheltered him and, carrying this on his shoulder, strode boldly across the field toward
the woods.

His scout uniform was inconspicuous; the scouts on duty at the mill saw only one of themselves
taking a bundle of hay round to the stables.

He reached the woods absolutely unchallenged. After a few yards in its friendly shade, he dropped
the thorny bundle and strode swiftly toward his own camp. He had not gone a hundred yards before
a voice of French type cried "'Alt," and he was face to face with a sentry whose musket was
levelled at him.

A quick glance interchanged, and each gasped out the other's name.

"Francois la Colle!"

"Rolf Kittering! Mon Dieu! I ought to shoot you, Rolf; I cannot, I cannot! But run, run! I'll
shoot over your head," and his kindly eyes filled with tears.

Rolf needed no second hint; he ran like a deer, and the musket ball rattled the branches above
his shoulders.

In a few minutes other soldiers came running and from La Colle they heard of the hostile spy
in camp.

"I shoot; I t'ink maybe I not hit eem; maybe some brood dere? No, dat netting."

There were both runners and trackers in camp. They were like bloodhounds and they took up the
trail of the fugitive. But Rolf was playing his own game now; he was "Flying Kittering." A
crooked trail is hard to follow, and, going at the long stride that had made his success, he
left many a crook and turn. Before two miles I they gave it up and the fugitive coming to the
river drank a deep and cooling draught, the first he had had that day. Five miles through is
the dense forest that lies between La Colle and the border. He struck a creek affluent of the
Richelieu River and followed to its forks, which was the place of rendezvous with Quonab.

It was evening as he drew near and after long, attentive listening he gave the cry of the barred
owl:

The answer came: a repetition of the last line, and a minute later the two scouts were together.

As they stood, they were startled by a new, sudden answer, an exact repetition of the first
call. Rolf had recovered his rifle from its hiding place and instantly both made ready for
some hostile prowler; then after a long silence he gave the final wail line "hoooo-aw" and
that in the woods means, "Who are you?"

Promptly the reply came:

"Wa wah wa wah Wa wah wa hoooo-aw."

But this was the wrong reply. It should have been only the last half. The imitation was perfect,
except, perhaps, on the last note, which was a trifle too human. But the signal was well done;
it was an expert calling, either an Indian or some thoroughly seasoned scout; yet Quonab was
not deceived into thinking it an owl. He touched his cheek and his coat, which, in the scout
sign language, means "red coat," i. e., Britisher.

Rolf and his partner got silently out of sight, each with his rlile cocked and ready to make
a hole in any red uniform or badge that might show itself. Then commenced a very peculiar duel,
for evidently the enemy was as clever as themselves and equally anxious to draw them out of cover.

Wa-wah-wa hooo-aw called the stranger, giving the right answer in the wrong place. It is an ignorant assumption
on part that it is the feelings most of" respect, duty, and gratitude" that make a Bushman provide
his bride' s father with game a couple of winters.

Such feelings are' s unknown to the Bushman soul. The answer came promptly and much nearer:

Wa--wah--wa--hoooo-aw.

Good! the medicine was working. So Rolf softened his voice still more, while Quonab got ready
to shoot.

The Wa--wa--hooo-aw that came in answer this time was startlingly clear and loud and nearly
perfect in intonation, but again betrayed by the human timbre of the aw. A minute or two more
and they would reach a climax.

After another wait, Rolf muffled his voice and gave the single hooo-aw, and a great broad-winged
owl came swooping through the forest, alighted on a tree overhead, peered about, then thrilled
them with his weird:

Wa--hoo--wa--boo

Wa--hoo--wa--hooooooooo-aw, the last note with the singular human quality that had so completely
set them astray.

Chapter 77. Why Plattsburg Was Raided

     The owl's hull reputation for wisdom is built up on lookin'
     wise and keepin' mum.--Sayings of St Sylvanne

THE owl incident was one of the comedies of their life, now they had business on hand. The
scraps of news brought by Quonab pieced out with those secured by Rolf, spelt clearly this:
that Colonel Murray with about a thousand men was planning a raid on Plattsburg.

Their duty was to notify General Hampton without delay.

Burlington, forty miles away, was headquarters. Plattsburg, twenty miles away, was marked for
spoil.

One more item they must add: Was the raid to baby land or water? If the latter, then they must
know what preparations were being made at the British naval station, Isle au Noix. They travelled
all night through the dark woods, to get there, though it was but seven miles away, and in
the first full light they saw the gallant array of two warships, three gunboats, and about
fifty long boats, all ready, undoubtedly waiting only for a change in the wind, which at this
season blew on Champlain almost steadily form the south.

A three-hour, ten-mile tramp through ways now familiar brought Rolf and his partner to the
north of the Big Chazy where the canoe was hidden, and without loss of time they pushed off
for Burlington, thirty miles away. The wind was head on, and when four hours later they stopped
for noon, they had made not more than a dozen miles.

All that afternoon they had to fight a heavy sea; this meant they must keep near shore in case
of an upset, and so lengthened the course; but it also meant that the enemy would not move
so long as this wind kept up.

It was six at night before the scouts ran into Burlington Harbour and made for Hampton's headquarters.

His aide received them and, after learning that they had news, went in to the general. From
the inner room now they heard in unnecessarily loud tones the great man's orders to, "Bring
them in, sah."

The bottles on the table, his purple visage, and thick tongued speech told how well-founded
were the current whispers.

"Raid on Plattsburg? Ha! I hope so. I only hope so. Gentlemen," and he turned to his staff,
"all I ask is a chance to get at them--Ha, Ha! Here, help yourself, Macomb," and the general
pushed the decanter to a grave young officer who was standing by.

"No, thank you, sir," was the only reply.

The general waved his hand, the scouts went out, puzzled and ashamed. Was this the brains of
the army? No wonder our men are slaughtered.

Now Macomb ventured to suggest: "Have you any orders, sir? These scouts are considered quite
reliable. I understand from them that the British await only a change of wind. They have between
one thousand and two thousand men."

"Plenty of time in the morning, sah. Plattsburg will be the bait of my trap, not one of them
shall return alive," and the general dismissed his staff that he might fortify himself against
a threatened cold.

Another young man, Lieut. Thomas MacDonough, the naval commandant, now endeavoured to stir
him by a sense of danger. First he announced that his long boats, and gunboats were ready and
in six hours he could transfer three thousand troops from Burlington to Plattsburg. Then he
ventured to urge the necessity for action.

Champlain is a lake of two winds. It had brown from the south for two weeks; now a north wind
was likely to begin any day. MacDonough urged this point, but all in vain, and, shocked and
humiliated, the young man obeyed the order "to wait till his advice was asked."

The next day Hampton ordered a review, not an embarkation, and was not well enough to appear
in person.

The whole army knew now of the situation of affairs, and the militia in particular were not
backward in expressing their minds.

Next day, July 30th, the wind changed. Hampton did nothing. On the morning of July 31st they
heard the booming of guns in the north, and at night their scouts came with the news that the
raid was on. Plattsburg was taken and pillaged by a force less than one third of those held
at Burlington.

There were bitter, burning words on the lips of the rank and file, and perfunctory rebukes
on the lips of the young officers when they chanced to overhear. The law was surely working
out as set forth by Si Sylvanne: "The fools in command, the leaders in the ranks."

And now came news of fresh disasters--the battles of Beaverdam, Stony Creek, and Niagara River.
It was the same story in nearly every case--brave fighting men, ill-drilled, but dead shots,
led into traps by incompetent commanders.

In September Lieutenant Macomb was appointed to command at Plattsburg. This proved as happy
an omen as it was a wise move. Immediately after, in all this gloom, came the news of Perry's
famous victory on Lake Erie, marking a new era for the American cause, followed by the destruction
of Moraviantown and the British army which held it.

Stirred at last to action General Wilkinson sent despatches to Hampton to arrange an attack
on Montreal. There was no possibility of failure, he said, for the sole defence of Montreal
was 600 marines. His army consisted of 8000 men. Hampton's consisted of 4000. By a union of
these at the mouth of Chateaugay River, they would form an invincible array.

So it seemed. Rolf had not yet seen any actual fighting and began to long for the front. But
his powers as a courier kept him ever busy bearing despatches. The road to Sackett's Harbour
and thence to Ogdensburg and Covington, and back to Plattsburg he knew thoroughly, and in his
canoe he had visited every port on Lakes Champlain and George.

He was absent at Albany in the latter half of October and first of November, but the ill news
travelled fast. Hampton requested MacDonough to "swoop down on Isle au Noix"--an insane request,
compliance with which would have meant certain destruction to the American fleet. MacDonough's
general instructions were: "Cooperate with the army, but at any price retain supremacy of the
lake," and he declined to receive Hampton's order.

Threatening court-martials and vengeance on his return, Hampton now set out by land; but at
Chateaugay he was met by a much smaller force of Canadians who resisted him so successfully
that he ordered a retreat and his army retired to Plattsburg.

Meanwhile General Wilkinson had done even worse. His army numbered 8000. Of these the rear
guard were 2500. A body of 800 Canadians harassed their line of march. Turning to brush away
this annoyance, the Americans were wholly defeated at Chrystler's farm and, giving up the attack
on Montreal, Wilkinson crossed the St. Lawrence and settled for the winter at Chateaugay.

In December, America scored an important advance by relieving Hampton of his command.

As the spring drew near, it was clearly Wilkinson's first play to capture La Colle Mill, which
had been turned into a fortress of considerable strength and a base for attack on the American
border, some five miles away.

Of all the scouts Rolf best knew that region, yet he was the one left out of consideration
and despatched with papers to Plattsburg. The attack was bungled from first to last, and when
Wilkinson was finally repulsed, it was due to Macomb that the retreat was not a rout.

But good came out of this evil, for Wilkinson was recalled and the law was nearly fulfilled--the
incompetents were gone. General Macomb was in command of the land force and MacDonough of the Lake.

Chapter 78. Rumours and Papers

MacDonough's orders were to hold control of the Lake. How he did it will be seen. The British
fleet at Isle au Noix was slightly stronger than his own, therefore he established a navy yard
at Vergennes, in Vermont, seven miles up the Otter River, and at the mouth erected earthworks
and batteries. He sent for Brown (of the firm of Adam and Noah Brown) a famous New York shipbuilder.
Brown agreed to launch a ship of twenty-four guns in sixty days. The trees were standing in
the forest on March 2d the keel was laid March 7th, and on April 11th the Saratoga was launched--forty
days after the timbers were green standing trees on the hills.

Other vessels were begun and pushed as expeditiously. And now MacDonough's wisdom in choice
of the navy yard was seen, for a British squadron was sent to destroy his infant fleet, or
at least sink stone-boats across the exit so as to bottle it up.

But their attempts were baffled by the batteries which the far-seeing American had placed at
the river's mouth.

The American victory at Chippewa was followed by the defeat at Lundy's Lane, and on August
25th the city of Washington was captured by the British and its public buildings destroyed.
These calamities, instead of dampening the spirits of the army, roused the whole nation at
last to a realization of the fact that they were at war. Fresh troops and plentiful supplies
were voted, the deadwood commanders were retired, and the real men revealed by the two campaigns
were given place and power.

At the same time, Great Britain, having crushed Napoleon, was in a position to greatly reinforce
her American army, and troops seasoned in Continental campaigns were poured into Canada.

All summer Rolf was busied bearing despatches. During the winter he and Quonab had built a
birch canoe on special lines for speed; it would carry two men but no baggage.

With this he could make fully six miles an hour for a short time, and average five on smooth
water. In this he had crossed and recrossed Champlain, and paddled its length, till he knew
every bay and headland. " There remains but this, then," said their:--' Peace and Plenty,
all fair things, Grace the realm where ye reign Kings; Grief and loss
come not anigh you, Glory guide and magnify you; Wisdom keep your
statesmen still Clinging fast, in good or ill, Clinging, like a bride
new- wed, Unto lips, and breast, and head: And day by day, that these
fair things befall, The Lady Lukshmi give her grace to all.'[, 21]

Mahâbhârata" in fragments Sir Edwin Arnold] INTRODUCTION
The" Mahâbhârata" is it. The Old Testament is not more interwoven with
Jewish race, nor the New Testament with the of Christendom, nor even
the Koran with the records and destinies of Islam, than is this great
Sanscrit art, the learning, the philosophy, the creeds, the modes
of thought, the very phrases, and daily ideas of the Hindoo people
are taken from this poem.

Their children are named after its heroes; so are their cities, streets,
and even cattle It is the spiritual life of the Hindoo people the
oldest epic in Sanscrit literature, and is sevenfold greater in bulk
than the"

Iliad" and" Odyssey" taken together.

This remarkable poem contains almost all the history of ancient India,
so far as it can be recovered, together with inexhaustible details
of all its political, social, and religious life-- in fact, the antique
Hindoo world stands epitomized in.

It is personified-- mere specimens, bearing to those vast treasures
of Sanscrit literature such small proportion as cabinet samples of ore have to
the riches of a mine. Such knowledge as we have the great Indian epics is largely
due to Sir William Jones, and the host of translators who followed him. In
its present shape the" Mahâbhârata poem with the the genealogies, the
nursery tales and religious discourses, the" contains some two hundred
thousand verses.

 He has less self-consciousness, more calm poise. He is not troubled
about what to do with his feet and hands, and is more convinced of his native dignity and claims
to respect. In the drawin-room Rolf was a hunter: the leading inhabitants of the region around
received him gladly and honoured him. He was guest at Judge Hubbell's in Chazy, in September
of 1814. Every day he scouted in the neighbourhood and at night returned to the hospitable
home of the judge.

On the 12th of September, from the top of a tall tree on a distant wooded hill, he estimated
the force at Champlain to be 10,000 to 15,000 men. Already their bodyguard was advancing on Chazy.

Judge Hubbell and anxious neighbours hastily assembled now, discussed with Rolf the situation
and above all, "What shall we do with our families?" One man broke into a storm of hate and
vituperation against the British. "Remember the burning of Washington and the way they treated
the women at Bladensburg."

"All of which about the women was utterly disproved, except in one case, and in that the criminal
was shot by order of his own commander," retorted Hubbell.

At Plattsburg others maintained that the British had harmed no one. Colonel Murray had given
strict orders that all private property be absolutely respected. Nothing but government property
was destroyed and only that which could be construed into war stores and buildings. What further
damage was done was the result of accident or error. Officers were indeed quartered on the
inhabitants, but they paid for what they got, and even a carpet destroyed by accident was replaced
months afterward by a British officer who had not the means at the time.

So it was agreed that Hubbell with Rolf and the village fathers and brothers should join their
country's army, leaving wives and children behind.

There were wet bearded cheeks among the strong, rugged men as they kissed their wives and little
ones and prepared to go, then stopped, as horrible misgivings rose within. "This was war, and
yet again, 'We have had proofs that the British harmed no woman or child'." So they dashed
away the tears, suppressed the choking in their throats, shouldered their guns, and marched
away to the front, commending their dear ones to the mercy of God and the British invaders.

None had any cause to regret this trust. Under pain of death, Sir George Prevost enforced his
order that the persons of women and children and all private property be held inviolate. As
on the previous raid, no damage was done to non-combatants, and the only hardships endured
were by the few who, knowing nothing, feared much, and sought the precarious safety of life
among the hills.

Sir George Prevost and his staff of ten officers were quartered in Judge Hubbell's house. Mrs.
Hubbell was hard put to furnish them with meals, but they treated her with perfect respect,
and every night, not knowing how long they might stay, they left on the table the price of
their board and lodging.

For three days they waited, then all was ready for the advance.

"Now for Plattsburg this week and Albany next, so good-bye, madam" they said politely, and
turned to ride away, a gay and splendid group.

"Good-bye, sirs, for a very little while, but I know you'll soon be back and hanging your heads
as you come," was the retort.

Sir George replied: "If a man had said that, I would call him out; but since it is a fair lady
that has been our charming hostess, I reply that when your prophecy comes true, every officer
here shall throw his purse on your door step as he passes."

So they rode away, 13,000 trained men with nothing between them and Albany but 2000 troops,
double as many raw militia, and--MacDonough of the Lake.

Ten times did Rolf cover that highway north of Plattsburg in the week that followed, and each
day his tidings were the same--the British steadily advance.

Chapter 79. McGlassin's Exploit

There was a wonderful spirit on everything in Plattsburg, and the earthly tabernacle in which
it dwelt, was the tall, grave young man who had protested against Hampton's behaviour at Burlington--Captain,
now General Macomb. Nothing was neglected, every emergency was planned for, every available
man was under arms. Personally tireless, he was ever alert and seemed to know every man in
his command and every man of it had implicit confidence in the leader. We have heard of soldiers
escaping from a besieged fortress by night; but such was the inspiring power of this commander
that there was a steady leaking in of men from the hills, undrilled and raw, but of superb
physique and dead shots with the ride.

A typical case was that of a sturdy old farmer who was marching through the woods that morning
to take his place with those who manned the breastworks and was overheard to address his visibly
trembling legs: "Shake, damn you, shake; and if ye knew where I was leading you, you'd be ten
times worse."

His mind was more valiant than his body, and his mind kept control--this is true courage.

No one had a better comprehension of all this than Macomb. He knew that all these men needed
was a little training to make of them the best soldiers on earth. To supply that training he
mixed them with veterans, and arranged a series of unimportant skirmishes as coolly and easily
as though he were laying out a programme for an evening's entertainment.

The first of these was at Culver's Hill. Here a barricade was thrown up along the highway,
a gun was mounted, and several hundred riflemen were posted under leaders skilled in the arts
of harrying a foe and giving him no chance to strike back.

Among the men appointed for the barricade's defence was Rolf and near him Quonab. The latter
had been seasoned in the Revolution, but it was the former's first experience at the battle
front, and he felt as most men do when the enemy in brave array comes marching up. As soon
as they were within long range, his leader gave the order "Fire!" The rifles rattled and the
return fire came at once. Balls pattered on the barricade or whistled above. The man next to
him was struck and dropped with a groan; another fell back dead. The horror and roar were overmuch.
Rolf was nervous enough when he entered the fight. Now he was unstrung, almost stunned, his
hands and knees were shaking, he was nearly panic-stricken and could not resist the temptation
to duck, as the balls hissed murder over his head. He was blazing away, without aiming, when
an old soldier, noting his white face and shaking form, laid a hand on his shoulder and, in
kindly tones, said: "Steady, boy, steady; yer losing yer head; see, this is how," and he calmly
took aim, then, without firing, moved the gun again and put a little stick to raise the muzzle
and make a better rest, then fired as though at target practice. "Now rest for a minute. Look
at Quonab there; you can see he's been through it before. He is making a hit with every shot."

Rolf did as he was told, and in a few minutes his colour came back, his hand was steady, and
thenceforth he began to forget the danger and thought only of doing his work.

When at length it was seen that the British were preparing to charge, the Americans withdrew
quickly and safely to Halsey's Corner, where was another barricade and a fresh lot of recruits
awaiting to receive their baptism of fire. And the scene was repeated. Little damage was done
to the foe but enormous benefit was gained by the Americans, because it took only one or two
of these skirmishes to turn a lot of shaky-kneed volunteers into a band of steady soldiers--for
they had it all inside. Thus their powder terror died.

That night the British occupied the part of the town that was north of the Saranac, and began
a desultory bombardment of the fortification opposite. Not a very serious one, for they considered
they could take the town at any time, but preferred to await the arrival of their fleet under
Downie.

The fight for the northern half of the town was not serious, merely part of Macomb's prearranged
training course; but when the Americans retired across the Saranac, the planks of the bridges
were torn up, loop-holed barricades were built along the southern bank, and no effort spared
to prepare for a desperate resistance.

Every man that could hold up a gun was posted on the lines of Plattsburg. The school-boys,
even, to the number of five hundred formed a brigade, and were assigned to places where their
squirrel-hunting experiences could be made of service to their country.

Meanwhile the British had established a battery opposite Fort Brown. It was in a position to
do some material and enormous moral damage. On the ninth it was nearly ready for bloody work,
and would probably begin next morning. That night, however, an extraordinary event took place,
and showed how far from terror-palsy were the motley troops in Plattsburg. A sturdy Vermonter,
named Captain McGlassin, got permission of Malcomb to attempt a very Spartan sortie.

He called for fifty volunteers to go on a most hazardous enterprise. He got one thousand at
once. Then he ordered all over twenty-five and under eighteen to retire. This reduced the number
to three hundred. Then, all married men were retired, and thus again they were halved. Next
he ordered away all who smoked--Ah, deep philosopher that he was!--and from the remnant he
selected his fifty. Among them was Rolf. Then he divulged his plan. It was nothing less than
a dash on the new-made fort to spike those awful guns--fifty men to dash into a camp of thirteen
thousand.

Again he announced, "Any who wish to withdraw now may do so." Not a man stirred.

Twenty of those known to be expert with tools were provided with hammers and spikes for the
guns, and Rolf was proud to be one of them.

In a night of storm and blackness they crossed the Saranac; dividing in two bodies they crawled
unseen, one on each side of the battery. Three hundred British soldiers were sleeping near,
only the sentries peered into the storm-sleet.

All was ready when McGlassin's tremendous voice was heard, "Charge front and rear!" Yelling,
pounding, making all the noise they could, the American boys rushed forth. The British were
completely surprised, the sentries were struck down, and the rest assured that Macomb's army
was on them recoiled for a few minutes. The sharp click, click, click of the hammers was heard.
An iron spike was driven into every touch hole; the guns were made harmless as logs and quickly
wheeling, to avoid the return attack, these bold Yankee boys leaped from the muzzled redoubt
and reached their own camp without losing one of their number.

Chapter 80. The Bloody Saranac

Sir George Prevost had had no intention of taking Plattsburg, till Plattsburg's navy was captured.
But the moral effect of McGlassin's exploit must be offset at once. He decided to carry the
city by storm--a matter probably of three hours' work.

He apportioned a regiment to each bridge, another to each ford near the town, another to cross
the river at Pike's Cantonment, and yet another to cross twenty miles above, where they were
to harry the fragments of the American as it fled.

That morning Plattsburg was wakened by a renewal of the bombardment. The heavy firing killed
a few men knocked down a few walls and chimneys, but did little damage to the earthworks. 

" Before we rest our wings, however, we must take another dart over the city, as far has existed as a piece
of local humour for nearly four hundred and fifty years. Button' s Coffee real, as well as notorious
thing to us, than the London Tavern, or the Crown and Anchor, or the Hummums, or White' s, or What'

lived Joshua Leicester One- square, on the site in St. Martin' s of
Miss Linwood' element exhibition and other houses, was the municipality
mansion of the Sydneys, Earls of Leicester, and the family of Sir
Philip and Algernon Sydney".

We think we recollect reading also, that in the same street. Sir Thomas More lived at Chelsea. breathe We have
omitted to mention that De, near where Foe kept a hosier' s shop in Cornhill; and that, on the street,
site of the present Southampton- buildings, at one of the corners of
Bow- street, was the tavern where Dryden held regal possession of
the chair a Franciscan Friar in Fleet- street.

Spenser died at an inn, where he his arrival from Ireland, in King-
street, Westminster-- the! same which runs at the back of Parliament-
street to the Abbey.

In Brook- Grosvenor- square, lived Handel; and in Bentinck- street, Manchester-
square, Gibbon. Addison lived and died in Holland House, Kensington,
now the residence of the accomplished nobleman who takes his title from
it, Chancery- lane stood the mansion of the Wriothesleys, Earls of Southampton
so, one of whom was the celebrated friend of Shakspeare.

Steele lived in Bury- street, St. James'; he furnishes an illustrious precedent for the loungers in St.
James'- street, where scandal- mongers of those as Stratford, where, times delighted to detect Isaac Bickerstaff
in the person of captain Steele, idling with all due tenderness for boarding-
school French, a joke of Chaucer before the Coffee- house, and jerking his leg
and stick alternately against the pavement. But who knows not Eastcheap
and the Boar' s and fleeting at Bow taps? Dryden lived and died in Gerrard-
Reynolds. In street, in a house which looked backwards into at the
garden of Head? Have we not all been there time out tore of mind? No less
an illustrious head than the Boar' s, in Eastcheap-- the Boar' s Head
Tavern, the scene of Falstaff' s revels.

We believe
the place is still marked out by a. But what have we not omitted also?
Among them, it is believed, was Chaucer, who is also said, upon the
strength of an old record, to have been fined two shillings for beating
similar sign.

Butler lived, perhaps died, in Rose- street, and was buried in Covent-
garden Churchyard- house, the resort of the wits of Queen' s Anne'
s time, was in Russell- street-- we believe the Hummums now stand.

Newton lived- street, on the south side of the square. The whole of Covent-
garden is ground, from its association with the dramatic and other
wits of the times of Dryden and Pope.

And is it not a more; where put up on Peter Pindar the other day followed him.[ 2] The Temple must have
had many eminent inmates. We have the birth of Ben Jonson, near Charing- cross.

He who gave the word to charge was dead with his second and third in command and before another
could come to change the order, the river ran red--the bloody Saranac they call it ever since.

The regiment was wrecked, and the assault for the time was over.

Rolf had plied his rifle with the rest, but it sickened him to see the horrible waste of human
valour. It was such ghastly work that he was glad indeed when a messenger came to say he was
needed at headquarters. And in an hour he was crossing the lake with news and instructions
for the officer in command at Burlington.

Chapter 81. The Battle of Plattsburg

In broad daylight he skimmed away in his one man canoe.

For five hours he paddled, and at star-peep he reached the dock at Burlington. The howl of
a lost dog caught his ear; and when he traced the sound, there, on the outmost plank, with
his nose to the skies, was the familiar form of Skookum, wailing and sadly alone.

What a change he showed when Rolf landed; he barked, leaped, growled, tail-wagged, head-wagged,
feet-wagged, body-wagged, wig-wagged and zigzagged for joy; he raced in circles, looking for
a sacrificial hen, and finally uttered a long and conversational whine that doubtless was full
of information for those who could get it out.

Rolf delivered his budget at once. It was good news, but not conclusive. Everything depended
now on MacDonough. In the morning all available troops should hurry to the defence of Plattsburg;
not less than fifteen hundred men were ready to embark at daylight.

That night Rolf slept with Skookum in the barracks. At daybreak, much to the latter's disgust,
he was locked up in a cellar, and the troops embarked for the front.

It was a brisk north wind they had to face in crossing and passing down the lake. There were
many sturdy oarsmen at the sweeps, but they could not hope to reach their goal in less than
five hours.

When they were half way over, they heard the cannon roar; the booming became incessant; without
question, a great naval battle was on, for this north wind was what the British had been awaiting.
The rowers bent to their task and added to the speed. Their brothers were hard pressed; they
knew it, they must make haste. The long boats flew. In an hour they could see the masts, the
sails, the smoke of the battle, but nothing gather of the portentous result. Albany and New
York, as well as Plattsburg, were in the balance, and the oarsmen rowed and rowed and rowed.

The cannon roared louder and louder, though less continuously, as another hour passed. Now
they could see the vessels only four miles away. The jets of smoke were intermittent from the
guns; masts went down. They could see it plainly. The rowers only set their lips and rowed
and rowed and rowed.

Sir George had reckoned on but one obstacle in his march to Albany, an obstruction named MacDonough;
but he now found there was another called Macomb.

It was obviously a waste of men to take Plattsburg by front assault, when he could easily force
a passage of the river higher up and take it on the rear; and it was equally clear that when
his fleet arrived and crushed the American fleet, it would be a simple matter for the war vessels
to blow the town to pieces, without risking a man.

Already a favouring wind had made it possible for Downie to leave Isle au Noix and sail down
the lake with his gallant crew, under gallant canvas clouds.

Tried men and true in control of every ship, outnumbering MacDonough, outweighing him, outpointing
him in everything but seamanship, they came on, sure of success.

Three chief moves were in MacDonough's strategy. He anchored to the northward of the bay, so
that any fleet coming down the lake would have to beat up against the wind to reach him; so
close to land that any fleet trying to flank him would come within range of the forts; and
left only one apparent gap that a foe might try to use, a gap in front of which was a dangerous
sunken reef. This was indeed a baited trap. Finally he put out cables, kedges, anchors, and
springs, so that with the capstan he could turn his vessels and bring either side to bear on
the foe.

All was ready, that morning of September the 11th as the British fleet, ably handled, swung
around the Cumberland Head.

The young commander of the Yankee fleet now kneeled bareheaded with his crew and prayed to
the God of Battles as only those going into battle pray. The gallant foe came on, and who that
knows him doubts that he, too, raised his heart in reverent prayer? The first broadside from
the British broke open a chicken coop on the Saratoga from which a game-cock flew, and, perching
on a gun, flapped his wings and crowed; so all the seamen cheered at such a happy omen.

Then followed the fighting, with its bravery and its horrors--its brutish wickedness broke loose.

Early in the action, the British sloop, Finch, fell into MacDonough's trap and grounded on
the reef.

The British commander was killed, with many of his officers. Still, the heavy fire of the guns
would have given them the victory, but for MacDonough's foresight in providing for swinging
his ships. When one broadside was entirely out of action, he used his cables, kedges and springs,
and brought the other batteries to bear.

It was one of the most desperate naval fights the world has ever seen. Of the three hundred
men on the British flagship not more than five, we are told, escaped uninjured; and at the
close there was not left on any one of the eight vessels a mast that could carry sail, or a
sail that could render service. In less than two hours and a half the fight was won, and the
British fleet destroyed.

To the God of Battles each had committed his cause: and the God of Battles had spoken.

Far away to the southward in the boats were the Vermont troops with their general and Rolf
in the foremost. Every sign of the fight they had watched as men whose country's fate is being
tried.

It was a quarter after eleven when the thunder died away; and the Vermonters were headed on
shore, for a hasty landing, if need be, when down from the peak of the British flag-ship went
the Union Jack, and the Stars and Stripes was hauled to take its place.

"Thank God!" a soft, murmuring sigh ran through all the boats and many a bronzed and bearded
cheek was wet with tears. Each man clasped hands with his neighbour; all were deeply moved,
and even as an audience melted renders no applause, so none felt any wish to vent his deep
emotion in a cheer.

Chapter 82. Scouting for Macomb

General Macomb knew that Sir George Prevost was a cautious and experienced commander. The loss
of his fleet would certainly make a radical change in his plans, but what change? Would he
make a flank move and dash on to Albany, or retreat to Canada, or entrench himself to await
reinforcements at Plattsburg, or try to retrieve his laurels by an overwhelming assault on
the town?

Whatever his plan, he would set about it quickly, and Macomb studied the enemy's camp with
a keen, discerning eye, but nothing suggesting a change was visible when the sun sank in the
rainy west.

It was vital that he know it at once when an important move was begun, and as soon as the night
came down, a score of the swiftest scouts were called for. All were young men; most of them
had been in McGlassin's band. Rolf was conspicuous among them for his tall figure, but there
was a Vermont boy named Seymour, who had the reputation of being the swiftest runner of them all.

They had two duties laid before them: first, to find whether Prevost's army was really retreating;
second, what of the regiment he sent up the Saranac to perform the flank movement.

Each was given the country he knew best. Some went westerly, some followed up the river. Rolf,
Seymour, and Fiske, another Vermonter, skimmed out of Plattsburg harbour in the dusk, rounded
Cumberland Bend, and at nine o'clock landed at Point au Roche, at the north side of Treadwell's
Bay.

Here they hid the canoe and agreeing to meet again at midnight, set off in three different
westerly directions to strike the highway at different points. Seymour, as the fast racer,
was given the northmost route; Rolf took the middle. Their signals were arranged--in the woods
the barred-owl cry, by the water the loon; and they parted.

The woods seemed very solemn to Rolf that historic September night, as he strode along at speed,
stopping now and again when he thought he heard some signal, and opened wide his mouth to relieve
his ear-drums of the heart-beat or to still the rushing of his breath.

In half an hour he reached the high-road. It was deserted. Then he heard a cry of the barred owl:

Wa--wah--wa--wah Wa--wah--wa--hooooo-aw.

He replied with the last line, and the answer came a repeat of the whole chant, showing that
it might be owl, it might be man; but it was not the right man, for the final response should
have been the hooooo-aw. Rolf never knew whence it came, but gave no further heed.

For a long time he sat in a dark corner, where he could watch the road. There were sounds of
stir in the direction of Plattsburg. Then later, and much nearer, a couple of shots were fired.
He learned afterward that those shots were meant for one of his friends. At length there was
a faint tump ta tump ta. He drew his knife, stuck it deep in the ground, then held the handle
in his teeth. This acted like a magnifier, for now he heard it plainly enough--the sound of
a horse at full gallop--but so far away that it was five minutes before he could clearly hear
it while standing. As the sound neared, he heard the clank of arms, and when it passed, Rolf
knew that this was a mounted British officer. But why, and whither?

In order to learn the rider's route, Rolf followed at a trot for a mile. This brought him to
a hilltop, whither in the silent night, that fateful north wind carried still the sound

     te--rump te--rump te--rump.

As it was nearly lost, Rolf used his knife again; that brought the rider back within a mile
it seemed, and again the hoof beat faded, te--rump te--rump.

"Bound for Canada all right," Rolf chuckled to himself. But there was nothing to show whether
this was a mere despatch rider, or an advance scout, or a call for reinforcements.

So again he had a long wait. About half-past ten a new and larger sound came from the south.
The knife in the ground increased but did not explain it. The night was moonless, dark now,
and it was safe to sit very near the road. In twenty minutes the sound was near at hand in
five, a dark mass was passing along the road. There is no mistaking the language of drivers.
There is never any question about such and such a voice being that of an English officer. There
can be no doubt about the clank of heavy wheels--a rich, tangy voice from some one in advance
said: "Oui. Parbleu, tows ce que je sais, c'est par la." A body of about one hundred Britishers,
two or three wagons, guns, and a Frenchman for guide. Rolf thought he knew that voice; yes,
he was almost sure it was the voice of Francios la Colle.

This was important but far from conclusive. It was now eleven. He was due at the canoe by midnight.
He made for the place as fast as he could go, which, on such a night, was slow, but guided
by occasional glimpses of the stars he reached the lake, and pausing a furlong from the landing,
he gave the rolling, quivering loon call:

Ho-o-o-o-ooo-o Ho-o-o-o-ooo-o. Hooo-ooo.

After ten seconds the answer came:

Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o Hoo-ooo.

And again after ten seconds Rolf's reply:

Hoo-ooo.

Both his friends were there; Fiske with a bullet-hole through his arm. It seemed their duty
to go back at once to headquarters with the meagre information and their wounded comrade. But
Fiske made light of his trouble--it was a mere scratch--and reminded them that their orders
were to make sure of the enemy's movements. Therefore, it was arranged that Seymour take back
Fiske and what news they had, while Rolf went on to complete his scouting.

By one o'clock he was again on the hill where he had marked the horseman's outward flight and
the escorted guns. Now, as he waited, there were sounds in the north that faded, and in the
south were similar sounds that grew. Within an hour he was viewing a still larger body of troops
with drivers and wheels that clanked. There were only two explanations possible: Either the
British were concentrating on Chazy Landing, where, protected from MacDonough by the north
wind, they could bring enough stores and forces from the north to march overland independent
of the ships, or else they were in full retreat for Canada. There was but one point where this
could be made sure, namely, at the forks of the road in Chazy village. So he set out at a jog
trot for Chazy, six miles away.

The troops ahead were going three miles an hour. Rolf could go five. In twenty minutes he overtook
them and now was embarrassed by their slowness. What should he do? It was nearly impossible
to make speed through the woods in the darkness, so as to pass them. He was forced to content
himself by marching a few yards in their rear.

Once or twice when a group fell back, he was uncomfortably close and heard scraps of their talk.

These left little doubt that the army was in retreat. Still this was the mere chatter of the
ranks. He curbed his impatience and trudged with the troop. Once a man dropped back to light
his pipe. He almost touched Rolf, and seeing a marching figure, asked in unmistakable accents
"Oi soi matey, 'ave ye a loight?" 

It is needless to say that the changes of good or bad luck affected him not at on all. Few men of his stamp indulge
in the weakness of railing at, which is the privilege and consolation
of the roturier. Neither was he ever heard to reproach a partner,
or become bitter against an adversary. He seemed to take a pleasure
in disappointing those who were always expecting from him some savage
outbreak of temper: they judged from his appearance, and had some grounds
for their anticipations; for, winning or losing, bows that strange look,
with sarcasm or innuendo, but scorned to stun him with blatant abuse--
of those who would never have dreamt of listening to a woman with
covered head, though they might be deaf as the nether millstone to
her entreaties or her tears.

It was wrecked, and the savate came in. Very few men came up to his standard of play; for he was hard to
please in style as well as in stakes. Keene did fully; and this,
with a had not overlaid the manner of courtly school in which he and
all his campaign had been trained; the school of those who certain
similarity of tastes, accounted pieces for his liking the latter so well.
He had little regard to throw away, and was chary of it in proportion.
On the other hand, Royston treated the invalid with an amount of
deference very unusual with him, in whom the bump of Veneration would
was probably represented by a cavity.

The two were still talking on the terrace, when a man passed them,
who lifted his hat slightly, and then sighed audibly, looking upward-
half- weary, half- defiant, never was off his face with the Revolution
that the rapier went out.

But, with Armand de Châteaumesnil, the grand seigneur had not been merged in the soldier contrition, as
though he apologized to heaven for such a bowing-: the brusquerie of the camp would stab their
enemy to the heart with an pretentious down to Rimmon.
 Her husband had come that way more than once.

"Who is it?" she demanded, through a small opening of the sash.

"Rolf Kittering," he whispered, "the place is surrounded by soldiers; can't you hide me?"

Could she? Imagine an American woman saying "No" at such a time.

He slipped in quietly.

"What news?" she said. "They say that MacDonough has won on the Lake, but Plattsburg is taken."

"No, indeed; Plattsburgh is safe; MacDonough has captured the fleet. I am nearly sure that
the whole British army is retiring to Canada."

"Thank God, thank God," she said fervently, "I knew it must be so; the women have met here
and prayed together every day, morning and night. But hush!" she laid a warning finger on her
lips and pointed up toward one of the rooms--"British officer."

She brought two blankets from a press and led up to the garret. At the lowest part of the roof
was a tiny door to a lumber closet. In this Rolf spread his blankets, stretched his weary limbs,
and soon was sound asleep.

At dawn the bugles blew, the camp was astir. The officer in the house arose and took his post
on the porch. He was there on guard to protect the house. His brother officers joined him.
Mrs. Hubbell prepared breakfast. It was eaten silently, so far as Rolf could learn. They paid
for it and, heading their regiment, went away northward, leaving the officer still on the porch.

Presently Rolf heard a stealthy step in his garret, the closed door was pushed open, and Mrs.
Hubbell's calm, handsome face appeared, as, with a reassuring nod, she set down a mug of coffee,
some bread, and a bowl of mush and milk. And only those who have travelled and fasted for twelve
hours when they were nineteen know how good it tasted.

From a tiny window ventilator Rolf had a view of the road in front. A growing din of men prepared
him for more troops, but still he was surprised to see ten regiments march past with all their
stores--a brave army, but no one could mistake their looks; they wore the despondent air of
an army in full retreat.

Chapter 83. The Last of Sir George Prevost

The battle was over at Plattsburg town, though it had not been fought; for the spirit of MacDonough
was on land and water, and it was felt by the British general, as well as the Yankee riflemen,
as soon as the Union Jack had been hauled from the mast of the Confiance.

Now Sir George Prevost had to face a momentous decision: He could force the passage of the
Saranac and march on to Albany, but his communications would be cut, and he must rely on a
hostile country for supplies. Every day drew fresh bands of riflemen from the hills. Before
he could get to Albany their number might exceed his, and then what? Unless Great Britain could
send a new army or a fleet to support him, he must meet the fate of Burgoyne. Prevost proposed
to take no such chances and the night of the 11th eight hours after MacDonough's victory, he
gave the order "Retire to Canada."

To hide the move as long as possible, no change was made till after sundown; no hint was given
to the beleaguered town; they must have no opportunity to reap the enormous advantages, moral
and material, of harrying a retreating foe. They must arise in the morning to find the enemy
safely over the border. The plan was perfect, and would have been literally carried out, had
not he had to deal with a foe as clever as himself.

How eagerly Rolf took in the scene on Chazy Road; how much it meant! how he longed to fly at
his fastest famous speed with the stirring news. In two hours and a half he could surely let
his leader know. And he gazed with a sort of superior pride at the martial pomp and bravery
of the invaders driven forth.

Near the last was a gallant array of gentlemen in gorgeous uniforms of scarlet and gold; how
warlike they looked, how splendid beside the ill-clad riflemen of Vermont and the rude hunters
of the Adirondacks. How much more beautiful is an iron sword with jewels, than a sword of plain
gray steel.

Dame Hubbell stood in her door as they went by. Each and all saluted politely; her guard was
ordered to join his regiment. The lady waved her sun-bonnet in response to their courteous
good-bye, and could not refrain from calling out:

"How about my prophecy, Sir George, and those purses?"

Rolf could not see his hostess, but he heard her voice, and he saw the astonishing effect:

The British general reined in his horse. "A gentleman's word is his bond, madam," he said.
"Let every officer now throw his purse at the lady's feet," and he set the example. A dozen
rattling thuds were heard and a dozen officers saluting, purseless, rode away.

A round thousand dollars in gold the lady gathered on her porch that morning, and to this day
her grand-kin tell the tale.

Chapter 84. Rolf Unmasks the Ambush

Rolf's information was complete now, and all that remained was to report at Plattsburg. Ten
regiments he had counted from his peep hole. The rear guard passed at ten o'clock. At eleven
Mrs. Hubbell did a little scouting and reported that all was quiet as far as she could see
both ways, and no enemy in sight anywhere.

With a grateful hand shake he left the house to cover the fourteen miles that lay between Chazy
and Plattsburg.

Refreshed and fed, young and strong, the representative of a just and victorious cause, how
he exulted in that run, rejoicing in his youth, his country, his strength, his legs, his fame
as a runner. Starting at a stride he soon was trotting; then, when the noon hour came, he had
covered a good six miles. Now he heard faint, far shots, and going more slowly was soon conscious
that a running fight was on between his own people and the body of British sent westward to
hold the upper Saranac.

True to the instinct of the scout, his first business was to find out exactly what and where
they were. From a thick tree top he saw the red-coats spotting an opening of the distant country.
Then they were lost sight of in the woods. The desultory firing became volley firing, once
or twice. Then there was an interval of silence. At length a mass of red-coats appeared on
the highway within half a mile. They were travelling very fast, in full retreat, and were coming
his way. On the crest of the hill over which the road ran, Rolf saw them suddenly drop to the
ground and take up position to form a most dangerous ambuscade, and half a mile away, straggling
through the woods, running or striding, were the men in the colours he loved. They had swept
the enemy before them, so far, but trained troops speedily recover from a panic, if they have
a leader of nerve, and seeing a noble chance in the angle of this deep-sunk road, the British
fugitives turned like boars at bay. Not a sign of them was visible to the Americans. The latter
were suffering from too much success. Their usual caution seemed to have deserted them, and
trotting in a body they came along the narrow road, hemmed in by a forest and soon to be hedged
with cliffs of clay. They were heading for a death-trap. At any price he must warn them. He
slid down the tree, and keeping cover ran as fast as possible toward the ambush. Thus it is that
Christians are to be sacrificed.

 He knew that the red-coats would not follow far in such a place,
and his comrades were near. But the alder thicket ended at a field. He heard the bushes crashing
close at hand, and dashed down a little ravine at whose lower edge the friendly forest recommenced.
That was his fatal mistake. The moment he took to the open there was a rattle of rifles from
the hill above, and Rolf fell on his face as dead.

It was after noontide when he fell; he must have lain unconscious for an hour; when he came
to himself he was lying still in that hollow, absolutely alone. The red-coats doubtless had
continued their flight with the Yankee boys behind them. His face was covered with blood. His
coat was torn and bloody; his trousers showed a ragged rent that was reddened and sopping.
His head was aching, and in his leg was the pain of a cripplement. He knew it as soon as he
tried to move; his right leg was shattered below the knee. The other shots had grazed his arm
and head; the latter had stunned him for a time, but did no deeper damage.

He lay still for a long time, in hopes that some of his friends might come. He tried to raise
his voice, but had no strength. Then he remembered the smoke signal that had saved him when
he was lost in the woods. In spite of his wounded arm, he got out his flint and steel, and
prepared to make a fire. But all the small wood he could reach was wet with recent rains. An
old pine stump was on the bank not far away; he might cut kindling-wood from that to start
his fire, and he reached for his knife. Alas! its case was empty. Had Rolf been four years
younger, he might have broken down and wept at this. It did seem such an unnecessary accumulation
of disasters. Without gun or knife, how was he to call his friends?

He straightened his mangled limb in the position of least pain and lay for a while. The September
sun fell on his back and warmed him. He was parched with thirst, but only thirty yards away
was a little rill. With a long and fearful crawling on his breast, he dragged himself to the
stream and drank till he could drink no more, then rested, washed his head and hands, 'and
tried to crawl again to the warm place. But the sun had dropped behind the river bank, the
little ravine was in shadow, and the chill of the grave was on the young man's pain-racked frame.

Shadows crossed his brain, among them Si Sylvanne with his quaint sayings, and one above all
was clear:

"Trouble is only sent to make ye do yer best. When ye hev done yer best, keep calm and wait.
Things is comin' all right." Yes, that was what he said, and the mockery of it hurt him now.

The sunset slowly ended; the night wind blew; the dragging hours brought gloom that entered
in. This seemed indeed the direst strait of his lot. Crippled, dying of cold, helpless, nothing
to do but wait and die, and from his groaning lips there came the half-forgotten prayer his
mother taught him long ago, "O God, have mercy on me!" and then he forgot.

When he awoke, the stars were shining; he was numb with cold, but his mind was clear.

"This is war," he thought, "and God knows we never sought it." And again the thought: "When
I offered to serve my country, I offered my life. I am willing to die, but this is not a way
of my choosing," and a blessed, forgetfulness came upon him again.

But his was a stubborn-fibred race; his spark of life was not so quickly quenched; its blazing
torch might waver, wane, and wax again. In the chill, dark hour when the life-lamp flickers
most, he wakened to hear the sweet, sweet music of a dog's loud bark; in a minute he heard
it nearer, and yet again at hand, and Skookum, erratic, unruly, faithful Skookum, was bounding
around and barking madly at the calm, unblinking stars.

A human "halloo" rang not far away; then others, and Skookum barked and barked.

Now the bushes rustled near, a man came out, kneeled down, laid hand on the dying soldier's
brow, and his heart. He opened his eyes, the man bent over him and softly said, "Nibowaka!
it's Quonab."

That night when the victorious rangers had returned to Plattsburg it was a town of glad, thankful
hearts, and human love ran strong. The thrilling stories of the day were told, the crucial
moment, the providential way in which at every hopeless pass, some easy, natural miracle took
place to fight their battle and back their country's cause. The harrying of the flying rear-guard,
the ambuscade over the hill, the appearance of an American scout at the nick of time to warn
them--the shooting, and his disappearance--all were discussed.

Then rollicking Seymour and silent Fiske told of their scouting on the trail of the beaten
foe; and all asked, "Where is Kittering?" So talk was rife, and there was one who showed a
knife he had picked up near the ambuscade with R. K. on the shaft.

Now a dark-faced scout rose up, stared at the knife, and quickly left the room. In three minutes
he stood before General Macomb, his words were few, but from his heart:

"It is my boy, Nibowaka; it is Rolf; my heart tells me. Let me go. I feel him praying for me
to come. Let me go, general. I must go."

It takes a great man to gauge the heart of a man who seldom speaks. "You may go, but how can
you find him tonight?"

"Ugh, I find him," and the Indian pointed to a little, prick-eared, yellow cur that sneaked
at his heels.

"Success to you; he was one of the best we had," said the general, as the Indian left, then
added: "Take a couple of men along, and, here, take this," and he held out a flask.

Thus it was that the dawning saw Rolf on a stretcher carried by his three scouting partners,
while Skookum trotted ahead, looking this way and that--they should surely not be ambushed
this time.

And thus the crowning misfortune, the culminating apes of disaster--the loss of his knife--the
thing of all others that roused in Rolf the spirit of rebellion, was the way of life, his dungeon's
key, the golden chain that haled him from the pit.

Chapter 85. The Hospital, the Prisoners, and Home

There were wagons and buckboards to be had, but the road was rough, so the three changed off
as litter-bearers and brought him to the lake where the swift and smooth canoe was ready, and
two hours later they carried him into the hospital at Plattsburg.

The leg was set at once, his wounds were dressed, he was warmed, cleaned, and fed; and when
the morning sun shone in the room, it was a room of calm and peace.

The general came and sat beside him for a time, and the words he spoke were ample, joyful compensation
for his wounds. MacDonough, too, passed through the ward, and the warm vibrations of his presence
drove death from many a bed whose inmate's force ebbed low, whose soul was walking on the brink,
was near surrender.

.
 And his own heart went back,
and ever back, to the rugged farm on the shores of the noble George.

In two weeks he was able to sit up. In three he could hobble, and he moved about the town when
the days were warm.

And now he made the acquaintance of the prisoners. They were closely guarded and numbered over
a hundred. It gave him a peculiar sensation to see them there. It seemed un-American to hold
a human captive; but he realized that it was necessary to keep them for use as hostages and
exchanges.

Some of them he found to be sullen brutes, but many were kind and friendly, and proved to be
jolly good fellows.

On the occasion of his second visit, a familiar voice saluted him with, "Well, Rolf! Comment
ca va?" and he had the painful joy of greeting Francois la Colle.

"You'll help me get away, Rolf, won't you?" and the little Frenchman whispered and winked.
"I have seven little ones now on La Riviere, dat have no flour, and tinks dere pa is dead."

"I'll do all I can, Francois," and the picture of the desolate home, brought a husk in his
voice and a choke in his throat. He remembered too the musket ball that by intent had whistled
harmless overhead. "But," he added in a shaky voice, "I cannot help my country's enemy to escape."

Then Rolf took counsel with McGlassin, told him all about the affair at the mill, and McGlassin
with a heart worthy of his mighty shoulders, entered into the spirit of the situation, went
to General Macomb presenting such a tale and petition that six hours later Francis bearing
a passport through the lines was trudging away to Canada, paroled for the rest of the war.

There was another face that Rolf recognized--hollow-cheeked, flabby-jowled and purplish-gray.
The man was one of the oldest of the prisoners. He wore a white beard end moustache. He did
not recognize Rolf, but Rolf knew him, for this was Micky Kittering. How he escaped from jail
and joined the enemy was an episode of the war's first year. Rolf was shocked to see what a
miserable wreck his uncle was. He could not do him any good. To identify him would have resulted
in his being treated as a renegade, so on the plea that he was an old man, Rolf saw that the
prisoner had extra accommodation and out of his own pocket kept him abundantly supplied with
tobacco. Then in his heart he forgave him, and kept away. They never met again.

The bulk of the militia had been disbanded after the great battle. A few of the scouts and
enough men to garrison the fort and guard the prisoners were retained. Each day there were
joyful partings--the men with homes, going home. And the thought that ever waxed in Rolf came
on in strength. He hobbled to headquarters. "General, can I get leave--to go--he hesitated--home?"

"Why, Kittering, I didn't know you had a home. But, certainly, I'll give you a month's leave
and pay to date."

Champlain is the lake of the two winds; the north wind blows for six months with a few variations,
and the south wind for the other six months with trifling.

Next morning a bark canoe was seen skimming southward before as much north wind as it could
stand, with Rolf reclining in the middle, Quonab at the stern, and Skookum in the bow.

In two days they were at Ticonderoga. Here help was easily got at the portage and on the evening
of the third day, Quonab put a rope on Skookum's neck and they landed at Hendrik's farm.

The hickory logs were blazing bright, and the evening pot was reeking as they opened the door
and found the family gathered for the meal.

"I didn't know you had a home," the general had said. He should have been present now to see
the wanderer's welcome. If war breeds such a spirit in the land, it is as much a blessing as
a curse. The air was full of it, and the Van Trumpers, when they saw their hero hobble in,
were melted. Love, pity, pride, and tenderness were surging in storms through every heart that
knew. "Their brother, their son come back, wounded, but proven and glorious." Yes, Rolf had
a home, and in that intoxicating realization he kissed them all, even Annette of the glowing
cheeks and eyes; though in truth he paid for it, for it conjured up in her a shy aloofness
that lasted many days.

Old Hendrik sputtered around. "Och, I am smile; dis is goood, yah. Vere is that tam dog? Yah!
tie him not, he shall dis time von chicken have for joy."

"Marta," said Rolf, "you told me to come here if I got hurt. Well, I've come, and I've brought
a boat-load of stuff in case I cannot do my share in the fields."

"Press you, my poy you didn't oughter brung dot stuff; you know we loff you here, and effery
time it is you coom I get gladsomer, and dot Annette she just cried ven you vent to de war."

"Oh, mother, I did not; it was you and little Hendrick!" and Annette turned her scarlet cheeks
away.

October, with its trees of flame and gold, was on the hills; purple and orange, the oaks and
the birches; blue blocked with white was the sky above, and the blue, bright lake was limpid.

"Oh, God of my fathers," Quonab used to pray, "when I reach the Happy Hunting, let it be ever
the Leaf-falling Moon, for that is the only perfect time." And in that unmarred month of sunny
sky and woodlands purged of every plague, there is but one menace in the vales. For who can
bring the glowing coal to the dry-leafed woods without these two begetting the dread red fury
that devastates the hills?

Who can bring the fire in touch with tow and wonder at the blaze? Who, indeed? And would any
but a dreamer expect young manhood in its growing strength, and girlhood just across the blush-line,
to meet in daily meals and talk and still keep up the brother and sister play? It needs only
a Virginia on the sea-girt island to turn the comrade into Paul.

"Marta, I tink dot Rolf an Annette don't quarrel bad, ain't it?"

"Hendrik, you vas von blind old bat-mole," said Marta, "I fink dat farm next ours purty good,
but Rolf he say 'No Lake George no good.' Better he like all his folk move over on dat Hudson."

Chapter 86. The New Era of Prosperity

As November neared and his leave of absence ended, Rolf was himself again; had been, indeed,
for two weeks, and, swinging fork or axe, he had helped with many an urgent job on the farm.

A fine log stable they had rolled up together, with corners dovetailed like cabinet work, and
roof of birch bark breadths above the hay.

But there was another building, too, that Rolf had worked at night and day. It was no frontier
shack, but a tall and towering castle, splendid and roomy, filled with loved ones and love.
Not by the lake near by, not by the river of his choice, but higher up than the tops of the
high mountains it loomed, and he built and built until the month was nearly gone. Then only
did he venture to ask for aid, and Annette it was who promised to help him finish the building.

Yes, the Lake George shore was a land of hungry farms. It was off the line of travel, too.
It was neither Champlain nor Hudson; and Hendrik, after ten years' toil with barely a living
to show, was easily convinced. Next summer they must make a new choice of home. But now it
was back to Plattsburg.

On November 1st Rolf and Quonab reported to General Macomb. There was little doing but preparations
for the winter. There were no prospects of further trouble from their neighbours in the north.
Most of the militia were already disbanded, and the two returned to Plattsburg, only to receive
their honourable discharge, to be presented each with the medal of war, with an extra clasp
on Rolf's for that dauntless dash that spiked the British guns.

Wicked war with its wickedness was done at last. "The greatest evil that can befall a country,"
some call it, and yet out of this end came three great goods: The interstate distrust had died
away, for now they were soldiers who had camped together, who had "drunk from the same canteen";
little Canada, until then a thing of shreds and scraps, had been fused in the furnace, welded
into a young nation, already capable of defending her own. England, arrogant with long success
at sea, was taught a lesson of courtesy and justice, for now the foe whom she had despised
and insulted had shown himself her equal, a king of the sea-king stock. The unnecessary battle
of New Orleans, fought two weeks after the war was officially closed, showed that the raw riflemen
of Tennessee were more than a match for the seasoned veterans who had overcome the great Napoleon,
and thus on land redeemed the Stars and Stripes.

The war brought unmeasured material loss on all concerned, but some weighty lasting gains to
two at least. On December 24, 1814, the Treaty of Ghent was signed and the long rides were
hung up on the cabin walls. Nothing was said in the treaty about the cause of war--the right
of search. Why should they speak of it? If a big boy bullies a smaller one and gets an unexpected
knockdown blow, it is not necessary to have it all set forth in terms before they shake hands
that "I, John, of the first part, to wit, the bully, do hereby agree, promise, and contract
to refrain in future forevermore from bullying you, Jonathan, of the second part, to wit, the
bullied." That point had already been settled by the logic of events. The right of search was
dead before the peace was born, and the very place of its bones is forgotten to-day.

Rolf with Quonab returned to the trapping that winter; and as soon as the springtime came and
seeding was over, he and Van Trumper made their choice of farms. Every dollar they could raise
was invested in the beautiful sloping lands of the upper Hudson. Rolf urged the largest possible
purchase now. Hendrick looked somewhat aghast at such a bridge-burning move. But a purchaser
for his farm was found with unexpected promptness, one who was not on farming bent and the
way kept opening up.

The wedding did not take place till another year, when Annette was nineteen and Rolf twenty-one.
And the home they moved to was not exactly a castle, but much more complete and human.

This was the beginning of a new settlement. Given good land in plenty, and all the rest is
easy; neighbours came in increasing numbers; every claim was taken up; Rolf and Hendrik saw
themselves growing rich, and at length the latter was thankful for the policy that he once
thought so rash, of securing all the land he could. Now it was his making, for in later years
his grown-up sons were thus provided for, and kept at home.

The falls of the river offered, as Rolf had foreseen, a noble chance for power. Very early
he had started a store and traded for fur. Now, with the careful savings, he was able to build
his sawmill; and about it grew a village with a post-office that had Rolf's name on the signboard.

Quonab had come, of course, with Rolf, but he shunned the house, and the more so as it grew
in size. In a remote and sheltered place he built a wigwam of his own.

Skookum was divided in his allegiance, but he solved the puzzle by dividing his time between
them. He did not change much, but he did rise in a measure to the fundamental zoological fact
that hens are not partridges; and so acquired a haughty toleration of the cackle-party throng
that assembled in the morning at Annette's call. Yes, he made even another step of progress,
for on one occasion he valiantly routed the unenlightened dog of a neighbour, a "cur of low
degree," whose ideas of ornithology were as crude as his own had been in the beginning.

All of which was greatly to his credit, for he found it hard to learn now; he was no longer
young, and before he had seen eight springs dissolve the snow, he was called to the Land of
Happy Hunting, where the porcupine is not, but where hens abound on every side, and there is
no man near to meddle with his joy.

Yet, when he died, he lived. His memory was kept ever green, for Skookum Number 2 was there
to fill his room, and he gave place to Skookum 3, and so they keep their line on to this very day.

Quonab Goes Home

The public has a kind of crawlin' common-sense, that is always right and fair in the end, only
it's slow--Sayings of Si Sylvanne.

Twenty years went by. Rolf grew and prospered. He was a man of substance and of family now;
for store and mill were making money fast, and the little tow-tops came at regular intervals.

And when the years had added ripeness to his thought, and the kind gods of gold had filled
his scrip, it was that his ampler life began to bloom. His was a mind of the best begetting,
born and bred of ancient, clean-blooded stock; inflexibly principled, trained by a God-fearing
mother, nurtured in a cradle of adversity, schooled in a school of hardship, developed in the
big outdoors, wise in the ways of the woods, burnt in the fire of affliction, forced into self-reliance,
inspired with the lofty inspiration of sacrificial patriotism--the good stuff of his make-up
shone, as shines the gold in the fervent heat; the hard blows that prove or crush, had proved;
the metal had rung true; and in the great valley, Rolf Kittering was a man of mark.

The country's need of such is ever present and ever seeking. Those in power who know and measure
men soon sought him out, and their messenger was the grisly old Si Sylvanne.

Because he was a busy man, Rolf feared to add to his activities. Because he was a very busy
man, the party new they needed him. So at length it was settled, and in a little while, Rolf
stood in the Halls of Albany and grasped the hand of the ancient mill-man as a colleague, filling
an honoured place in the councils of the state.

Each change brought him new activities. Each year he was more of a public man, and his life
grew larger. From Albany he went to New York, in the world of business and men's affairs; and
at last in Washington, his tall, manly figure was well known, and his good common-sense and
clean business ways were respected. Yet each year during hunting time he managed to spend a
few weeks with Quonab in the woods. Tramping on their ancient trapping grounds, living over
the days of their early hunts; and double zest was added when Rolf the second joined them and
lived and loved it all.

But this was no longer Kittering's life, rather the rare precarious interval, and more and
more old Quonab realized that they were meeting only in the past. When the big house went up
on the river-bank, he indeed had felt that they were at the parting of the ways. His respect
for Nibowaka had grown to be almost a worship, and yet he knew that their trails had yearly
less in common. Rolf had outgrown him; he was alone again, as on the day of their meeting.
His years had brought a certain insight; and this he grasped--that the times were changed,
and his was the way of a bygone day.

"Mine is the wisdom of the woods," he said, "but the woods are going fast; in a few years there
will be no more trees, and my wisdom will be foolishness. There is in this land now a big,
strong thing called 'trade,' that will eat up all things and the people themselves. You are
wise enough, Nibowaka, to paddle with the stream, you have turned so the big giant is on your
side, and his power is making you great. But this is not for me; so only I have enough to eat,
and comfort to sleep, I am content to watch for the light."

Across the valley from the big store he dwelt, in a lodge from which he could easily see the
sunrise. Twenty-five years added to the fifty he spent in the land of Mayn Mayano had dimmed
his eye, had robbed his foot of its spring, and sprinkled his brow with the winter rime; but
they had not changed his spirit, nor taught him less to love the pine woods and the sunrise.
Yes, even more than in former days did he take his song-drum to the rock of worship, to his
idaho--as the western red man would have called it. And there, because it was high and the
wind blew cold, he made a little eastward-facing lodge.

He was old and hunting was too hard for him, but there was a strong arm about him now; he dimly
thought of it at times--the arm of the fifteen-year-old boy that one time he had shielded.
There was no lack of food or blankets in the wigwam, or of freedom in the woods under the sun-up
rock. But there was a hunger that not farseeing Nibowaka could appease, not even talk about.
And Quonab built another medicine lodge to watch the sun go down over the hill. Sitting by
a little fire to tune his song-drum, he often crooned to the blazing skies. Ines de Castro.-- G. St. Evie.-- An repulsive picture of one of the
most for extraordinary scenes in history.

The remains of Dona Ines de Castro taken out of her tomb six years after
the 352. of the Remains of interment, when she was proclaimed queen
of Portugal.

 He came from the unknown with a message to those who knew him not: "The Messiah was coming;
the deliverer that Hiawatha bade them look for. He was coming in power to deliver the red race,
and his people must sing the song of the ghost-dance till the spirit came, and in a vision
taught them wisdom and his will!"

Not to the white man, but to the lonely Indian in the hill cleft he came, and the song that
he brought and taught him was of a sorrowing people seeking their father.

"Father have pity on us! Our souls are hungry for Thee. There is nothing here to satisfy us
Father we bow to Thy will."

By the fire that night they sang, and prayed as the Indian prays--"Father have pity and guide
us." So Quonab sang the new song, and knew its message was for him.

The stranger went on, for he was a messenger, but Quonab sang again and again, and then the
vision came, as it must, and the knowledge that he sought.

None saw him go, but ten miles southward on the river he met a hunter and said: "Tell the wise
one that I have heard the new song. Tell him I have seen the vision. We are of the sunset,
but the new day comes. I must see the land of Mayn Mayano, the dawn-land, where the sun rises
out of the sea."

They saw no more of him. But a day later, Rolf heard of it, and set out in haste next morning
for Albany. Skookum the fourth leaped into the canoe as he pushed off. Rolf was minded to send
him back, but the dog begged hard with his eyes and tail. It seemed he ought to go, when it
was the old man they sought. At Albany they got news. "Yes, the Indian went on the steamboat
a few days ago." At New York, Rolf made no attempt to track his friend, but took the Stamford
boat and hurried to the old familiar woods, where he had lived and suffered and wakened as a boy.

There was a house now near the rock that is yet called "Quonab's." From the tenants he learned
that in the stillest hours of the night before, they had heard the beating of an Indian drum,
and the cadence of a chant that came not from throat of white man's blood. 

All this by way of prelude to a protest against You the exaggerative ecstasies
indulged in by many citizen discussing the air services enough.

The British pilots are competent and daring, but they would be the
last to claim me an undue share of war' s glory His long straight hair was nearly white, and by his side, forever still, lay
the song-drum of his people.

And those who heard the mournful strains the night before knew now from Rolf that it was Ouonab
come back to his rest, and the song that he sang was the song of the ghost dance.

"Pity me, Wahkonda. My soul is ever hungry. There is nothing here to satisfy me, I walk in
darkness; Pity me, Wahkondal."
