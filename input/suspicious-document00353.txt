ON FOOT MADE AT SUNDRY CONVENIENT TIMES BETWEEN MAY AND NOVEMBER, NINETEEN HUNDRED AND FIVE

BY C.G. HINE

HINE'S ANNUAL, 1905 BOOK I.

Entered, according to act of Congress, in the year 1906, by C.G. HINE, in the office of the
Librarian at Congress, Washington, D.C.

Foreword.

The Hudson Valley, above all other places in this country, combines historic and romantic interest
with the beauties of nature. It is one hundred and fifty miles crowded with the splendors of
mountain and forest and river, and replete with incident and legend. To quote George William
Curtis: "Its morning and evening reaches are like the lakes of a dream." Everyone who visits
New York comes or goes, if possible, by the river route. Few know much of anything, however,
about the Old Post Road, that one-time artery of travel and trade, whose dust has been stirred
by the moccasin of the Indian and the boot of the soldier; whose echoes are the crack of the
stage driver's whip and the whistle of the startled deer; whose bordering hills were named
for the wild boar and the wild cat, and along whose edges are still scattered the interesting
relics of a past that the passenger by steamer or rail can never know.

Take it in May or June when all nature is fresh and green, with fleecy clouds above, and below
a bank of wild azalea or an apple orchard in bloom. Or try it in the Fall when the woods are
as gay as the painted butterfly. Each season holds out its own attractions.

Few places can equal the Hudson Valley for the Autumn panorama. The brilliant colors of the
deciduous foliage intermingled with the dark of the evergreens rise from the blue of the river
to the blue of heaven with every variety of tree and shrub to lend a hand in the illumination.
It is red gold and yellow gold, purple and fine linen, and all manner of precious stones when
the sun puts a crown of glory on some great tulip or sparkles in the gorgeous maple leaves.
The colors are so splendid that even Turner, in all his glory, could not equal one of these.

There is no office at which to buy a ticket for this Post Road route. It is Shanks' mare, with
an independence and freedom that no other mode of travel knows. To be sure, one can also take
it on horseback, by bicycle or automobile, according to fancy and finances, and, provided he
does not exceed the speed limit, it matters little how he goes. The speed limit naturally differs
with the individual. The writer thinks that three miles an hour is fast enough--a pace that
enables one to keep his eyes on the picture and does not necessitate a continuous inspection
of the road.

Naturally the weather plays its part in such an open air journey, and this is particularly
the case if the trip be made on foot. It is the loss of the landscape, blotted out by the mist,
rather than the physical discomfort of being caught in a rain squall, that counts. In fact,
if one is protected by a light rubber cape, and will take the storm philosophically with a
mind to enjoy it and rise superior to the drip on his knees, there is huge satisfaction in
being alone with the patter of the rain. But the loss of the landscape is serious in such country
as the Post Road deals with. An instance of this comes vividly to mind in connection with the
Wiccopee Pass and the plain south of Fishkill. As I first saw it of a perfect June evening,
it was as delicately beautiful as a bit of silver filigree, but another time, in September,
the mist hung low on the mountains. It was either raining, or had just stopped, or was about
to begin again, and it had been doing that or worse all day and the day before, and that which
had been a delight in June was now a matter of so many miles to be disposed of as quickly as
possible. There is a local expression in these parts, applied to certain phases of the weather:
"As black as a black hat", which one can better appreciate after he has seen the scowl with
which an Autumn storm can sweep down these mountains. Good May or June weather and the soft
delight of Indian Summer are equally enjoyable, but avoid the Ides of March, or, in other words,
the days of the equinoctial.

The amount of baggage is best decided after one has tramped it a bit. At first the tendency
is to take the various little luxuries that are so necessary at home, but after they have been
pulling at the shoulders all day long and the unaccustomed strain has developed possibilities
in the way of aches undreamed of before, the conviction is gradually forced on the wayfarer
that every ounce counts, and next time many of the "necessities" are left behind. A light suit
of pajamas, a pair of extra sox and a thin rubber cape are greatly to be desired. A wash rag,
nail brush and small piece of soap, tooth brush, comb and shaving outfit, extra eye glasses,
small corkscrew and court plaster--all these can be carried in a "tourist's bag" slung from
one shoulder, and these are enough, with a bit of talcum powder and vaseline for chafed spots.
Over the other shoulder hang a small, light camera and take the Post Road home with you to
dream o'er of Winter nights.

New York to Albany by the Old Post Road.

In 1703 the Provincial Legislature passed a "Publick Highways" act, part of which reads as
follows:--

"Publick and Common General Highway to extend from King's Bridge in the County of Westchester
through the same County of Westchester, Dutchess County and the County of Albany, of the breadth
of four rods, English measurement, at the least, to be, continue and remain forever, the Publick
Common General Road and Highway from King's Bridge aforesaid to the ferry at Crawlier over
against the city of Albany."

This, being in the reign of Queen Anne, was at first known as the Queen's Road, but in due
time became known as the Albany Post Road.

Stages for the north originally started from Cortland Street; later the starting point was
moved up to Broadway and Twenty-first Street, and as other means of conveyance improved and
multiplied, the point for starting was moved north and further north until finally the railroad
was finished through to Albany and the stage coach was a reminiscence of bygone times.

It is "159 m. from N. York" to Albany by the Post Road, as the old mile stones figure it. When
they were set up, a hundred years or so ago, New York City was south of the present City Hall,
and one can get some idea of the city's growth when he knows that there still exists on Manhattan
Island a stone imbedded in a bordering wall along Broadway, and in about its proper place,
in the neighborhood of Two Hundred and Fifteenth Street, which reads "12 miles from N. York."

[Sidenote: KING'S BRIDGE.]

This trip starts with King's Bridge, built by Frederick Philipse in 1693. That bridge--which,
like Mark Twain's jackknife, that had had two new handles and six new blades, but was still
the same old jackknife--still connects Manhattan Island with the main land, being supported
on stone piers that are said to be the original ones used. There is but one other bridge in
the entire trip to Albany that can rival its antique and aged appearance, and that crosses
the Roeloff Jansen Kill in Columbia County. Just East of the King's Bridge was the "wading
place" of the Indians, and later of the Dutch, where the valiant Anthony Van Corlear met his
fate, and, according to Irving, gave the stream its present name.

To one who likes to speculate as to what might have been, had things been different, King's
Bridge affords large opportunity for thought. It seems always to have been a favorite haunt
of the human race, its encircling hills and accessibility by water no doubt being responsible
for this popularity. Extensive beds of oyster shells testify to former Indian occupancy, and
the Dutch appear to have shown the same preference for this quiet nook, though they finally
pitched their tents at the lower end of the island which furnished larger opportunity for trade.
If the city had been established here, would we to-day be taking our pleasure jaunts into the
country where now is the Battery, and would our antiquarians still be discovering Indian remains
in that region?

Bolton's History of Westchester County says that the site of the present village of King's
Bridge was that originally selected by the Dutch for their city of New Amsterdam, it being
a spot protected from the blasts of Winter by the encircling hills, and it may have been that
the swamps of Mosholu Creek gave them pleasurable anticipations of dykes and ditches--a touch
of home. They had but to re-name the creek and make it a real Amster Dam.

Spuyten Duyvil Hill toward the west was known to the Indians as Nipnichsen. Here they had a
castle or stockade to protect them against the Sauk-hi-can-ni, the "fire workers", who dwelt
on the western shore of the great river Mohican-i-tuck, and from which later came that delectable
fire-water known as "Jersey lightning," against which no red man is ever known to have raised
a hand. In later days three small American redoubts, known as forts Nos. 1, 2 and 3, crowned
this same hill. One of these is now doing duty as the cellar walls of a dwelling. On the rise
of ground to the east known as Tetard's Height, was Fort Independence, or No. 4. This series
of eight small forts, which covered the upper end of Manhattan Island from the heights of the
adjoining mainland, seem to have been more ornamental than useful, as they fell into British
hands with little or no fighting. No. 8 overlooked Laurel Hill, on which stood Fort George.

In the early days King's Bridge appears to have been the only connecting link with the mainland,
for not only did travelers for the north go this way, but it seems that those for the east
also availed themselves of this approach to the mainland, as Madam Knight, on her journey from
New Haven to New York, in 1704, speaks of coming to "Spiting Devil, else King's Bridge, where
they pay three pence for passing over with a horse, which the man that keeps the gate set up
at the end of the bridge receives."

The "Neutral Ground" came down to this point, and during the Revolution it was the borderland
over which the raids of both belligerents swept. Congress, recognizing its importance, ordered
in May, 1775, "That a post be immediately taken and fortified at or near King's Bridge, and
that the ground be chosen with a particular view to prevent the communication between the City
of New York and the country from being interrupted by land."

Here in January, 1777, Major-General Heath attacked a body of Hessians under Knyphausen and
drove them within their works, but the Americans were in turn driven off, and again in 1781,
in order to afford the French officers a view of the British outposts, the American Army moved
down to King's Bridge when the usual skirmish followed--in fact, it was a storm centre so long
as the British occupied New York.

The Macomb mansion, a fine house even to-day, once the home of Major-General Alexander Macomb,
the "hero of Plattsburg," still overlooks the waters of Spuyten Duyvil Creek. Originally a
tavern, it was purchased about 1800 by Alexander Macomb whose son, Robert, was ruined by the
destruction of Macomb's Dam, which went down before the embattled farmers, with whom it interfered.
The Macomb family was a band of sturdy fighters, all of the five sons taking an active part
in the militia or the regular army, but the reputation of the family rests principally on the
glorious deeds of Alexander in the war of 1812.

[Sidenote: THE VALE OF YONKERS.]

The Post Road, known in these days as Broadway, follows the eastern edge of the Mosholu swamp
to Van Cortlandt Park, through what is called the Vale of Yonkers. Here is Vault Hill, one
of the points selected by Washington on which to make a display for the benefit of the British
while he quietly led his main army south for the operations against Cornwallis. On a clear
day the hill is in plain view from Manhattan Island, and the camp fires and general indications
of activity on its summit helped materially in the scheme to deceive the enemy. The hill has
its name from the fact that it was used as a burial ground by the early generations of the
Van Cortlandt family. The property was sold in 1699 by Hon. Frederick Philipse to his son-in-law,
Jacobus Van Cortlandt (a brother of Stephanus Van Cortlandt of Cortlandt), and the mansion
was erected by Frederick Van Cortlandt in 1748. Northeast of it is situated Indian Field, memorable
as the scene of an engagement between the British and the Stockbridge Indians, resulting in
the practical annihilation of the latter.

[Sidenote: YONKERS.]

The road shortly becomes a village street and so continues into Yonkers. In 1646 the Indian
sachem Tacharew granted the land to Adrian Von der Donck, the first lawyer of New Netherland.
The Indians called it Nap-pe-cha-mack, the "rapid water settlement," the "settlement" being
located about the mouth of the stream now known as Sawmill River. The Dutch called their settlement
Younkers, Younckers, Jonkers or Yonkers, derived from Jonkheer, a common name for the male
heir of a Dutch family.

The old Philipse manor house, now Yonkers's City Hall, was erected about 1682, the present
front being added in 1745. In its palmy days it is said to have sheltered a retinue of thirty
white and twenty colored servants. Here was born Mary Philipse, July 3, 1730, the heroine of
Cooper's "Spy," and the girl who is said to have refused Washington. In January, 1758, she
married Col. Roger Morris. Tradition tells how, amid the splendors of the wedding feast, a
tall Indian, wrapped in his scarlet blanket, suddenly appeared in the doorway and solemnly
predicted that the family possessions should pass from its control "When the eagle shall despoil
the lion of his mane." The mystery was explained later when the property was confiscated because
of the royalist leanings of the family.

The site of Pomona Hall, burned some twenty years ago, where Burr took refuge for a time after
the Hamilton duel, is now occupied by a modern public school. It bordered the Post Road toward
the northern edge of the village, commanding a fine view of the Hudson.

Just inside the northern township line of Yonkers, in the river's edge, lies the Great Stone,
Mackassin, of the Indians, the "copper-colored stone," an enchanted rock which was an object
of veneration, and on whose flat surface the aborigines probably held sacred feasts. Originally
it stood out in the water, but the railway embankment has changed all this, and now it is overshadowed
by great advertising boards which the pale-face provides for his traveling brother to feast
his eyes upon.

For some miles, practically as far as the Croton River, the way is lined with the fine estates
of the wealthy, some made notable by reason of their owners, as Greystone, the former home
of Samuel J. Tilden. It is no uncommon thing to have some particularly fine lawn pointed out
as the most perfect in the country. If what the local patriots say is true, there is at least
one such in every village hereabouts.

This region is a bit too thickly settled for the pedestrian who, with his knapsack slung over
his shoulder, receives more attention from nurse maids and children than is sometimes comfortable,
but it is easily possible to send one's impedimenta on by rail if the night's stopping place
can be figured out in advance, and he can then progress without fear of gibe or jeer.

[Sidenote: GREENBURGH.]

Greenburgh, "Graintown" bounds Yonkers on the north. Here, the present site of Dobbs Ferry,
was the Indian town of Weck-quas-keck, "the place of the bark kettle." It was the unprovoked
murder of an Indian here and its subsequent revenge that led to the massacre of the Indians
in Jersey and the following Indian war which brought the Dutch almost to the last extremity.

[Sidenote: HASTINGS.]

Hastings, the first town beyond Yonkers, covers the old Post Estate. In early times the inhabitants
seem to have developed a rather unenviable reputation as sports, cock fights and horse racing
being mentioned as the principal amusements. Here, in 1776, a troop of Sheldon's Horse ambuscaded
a body of Hessians, only one of whom escaped. Peter Post, who appears to have helped lead the
enemy to destruction, was later caught by them and beaten, being left for dead.

As the traveler enters Hastings he passes the former residence of Dr. Henry Draper. The old
observatory, built in 1870, still stands, though damaged by a recent fire. Here Dr. Draper
made the first photographs ever taken of the moon. The name of Draper should be revered by
every amateur photographer. The father of Henry, Dr. John William, was a friend of Daguerre,
and it is said that in this building was developed the first portrait negative. The dwelling
is beautifully situated on the high river bluff and affords a wonderful view up and down the
watery highway.

Close on the road stands an old forge or smithy where Washington's officers were in the habit
of having their horses shod when in the neighborhood. The place also boasts a "Washington Spring,"
but its chiefest natural glory is a great walnut tree which tradition says was, away back in
the Indian days, a Council Tree of the Weckquaskecks. In one of the Draper cottages once lived
Admiral Farragut, whose wife used the first prize money he received to purchase some needed
article for the local church. There are few places that hold so many and varied interests for
the pilgrim as the old Draper homestead, and none whose hostess could be more gracious to the
stranger.

[Sidenote: DOBBS FERRY.]

The road winds along the sides of the hills, sometimes fifty, sometimes one hundred and fifty
feet above the water, and many are the beautiful vistas through the trees and across the well-kept
lawns. By this time the solid wall of the Palisades is beginning to break and the outline of
the Jersey hills becomes more varied. But we are just now interested nearer home, for as one
approaches Dobbs Ferry he steps on almost holy ground. Here is the Livingston house, where,
after the fighting was all over, Washington and Governor Clinton met the British commander,
General Sir Guy Carlton, to make the final arrangements for peace; here the papers were signed
which permitted of the disbanding of the American Army, and in which the British gave up all
claim upon the allegiance and control of the country.

So far back as 1698 a Dob was located here. On account of the ferry the place was an important
one during the Revolution and many interesting incidents happened in the neighborhood. It was
here that Arnold and André planned to hold their first meeting, but accident prevented their
coming together; and it was here that Sir Henry Clinton's representative met General Greene,
October, 1780, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the execution of André. In July, 1781,
the American and French armies were encamped on the hills round about while preparations were
being pushed as though for an attack on New York, pioneers being sent forward to clear the
roads toward King's Bridge. Even the American army was wholly unaware of Washington's intention
to strike Cornwallis, and the British were so completely deceived that the American troops
reached the Delaware before Clinton awoke to the situation.

Those patriotic Democrats who mourn the extravagance of the government in granting pensions
may be interested to know that the first pension ever granted by the United States was to a
Dobbs Ferry boy named Vincent, who was crippled for life by a gang of Tory cowboys. The boys
had been making remarks of a somewhat personal character which annoyed the gentle cowboy who,
catching three of them, killed two and permanently injured the third.

Of this class of freebooters Irving writes: "In a little while the debatable ground became
infested by roving bands, claiming from either side, and all pretending to redress wrongs and
punish political offenses; but all prone, in the exercise of their high functions, to sack
hen roosts, drive off cattle and lay farm houses under contributions; such was the origin of
two great orders of border chivalry, the Skinners and the Cowboys, famous in Revolutionary
story. The former fought, or rather marauded, under the American, the latter under the British
banner.

Some thirty-five years ago certain esthetic inhabitants of Dobbs Ferry, having long desired
to change its name, finally succeeded in arousing enough interest to warrant the calling of
a public meeting for the purpose of discussing the question. The general sentiment was that
the new name should have a patriotic tinge. The names of Paulding and Van Wart were favorites,
with a strong leaning toward the former. Finally one well-meaning but rather obtuse gentleman
arose and said that he knew both of these men; that he did not approve of Paulding; that Van
Wart was just as prominent in the André capture, and besides was a Christian gentleman, and
he proposed that the Van be dropped, and the town christened Wart-on-the-Hudson. The proposal
appears to have been made in all seriousness, but the ridiculousness of the situation killed
the scheme, and that common piece of clay, Dobbs, still reigns supreme.

The fine roads and the rush of a vanishing automobile remind one by the very contrast of the
days when the Post Road was a main artery of travel.

Here is a description of the delights of a stage coach journey:

"A stage journey from one part of the country to another was as comfortless as could well be
imagined. No wonder a man made his will and had prayers offered in church for his safe return
before he ventured forth. But even such a conveyance was a luxury. As a rule people traveled
on foot, carrying their packs on their backs. The well-to-do rode on horseback, and in some
places post chaises with relays of horses every ten or twenty miles could be obtained. What
would the ghosts of such travelers say to-day, should they stumble on a Pullman car or a dust-compelling
devil wagon? Our very expressions of speech are modeled on the common, every-day things of
life. Fifty or a hundred years ago the man who was a "slow coach" to-day would be "geared low."

[Sidenote: COL. JOHN ODELL.]

At least two of the many interesting buildings hereabouts are worth noting. Standing back from
the road a quarter of a mile or so, and within the compass of the Ardsley Club grounds, is
a plain little cottage whose clapboards show no mark of the planing mill. Here once lived the
redoubtable Col. John Odell, whose father, Jonathan, languished in a British prison in New
York because his son was fighting under the flag of freedom. At the time of his capture Jonathan
Odell was living on the Odell Estate, which was later sold to a son of Alexander Hamilton.
It is told that the Hessians hanged a negro slave of Odell's three separate times in an effort
to make him disclose the hiding place of certain hogs with which the said Hessians were anxious
to fraternise.

[Sidenote: CYRUS W. FIELD.]

A step further on stands the former residence of Cyrus W. Field, whose place, known as Ardsley,
at one time covered some five hundred or more acres extending from the Post Road over the ridge
to the Sawmill River. The house was built in the day of the mansard roof, and is not a particularly
picturesque creation, but every American is interested in the man who succeeded in linking
his country with the outside world as did Cyrus W. Field.

[Sidenote: SUNNYSIDE.]

As we proceed toward the land of enchantment the surroundings seem to take on a more mysterious
air. Sounds that awhile before meant nothing more than the wind in the trees now begin to make
one think of the rush of galloping cowboys or Hessians on mischief bent; or, if perchance we
catch through the gathering dusk a glint of white on the river below, may it not be that Flying
Dutchman who, tired of the narrow bounds of the Tappan Zee, is trying to steal out to the open
ocean while the constable sleeps, but the cause of such speculation is gone almost before the
speculation itself takes shape. However, the abode wherein so many of these marvels were clothed
in becoming language is close at hand--Sunnyside. The honeysuckle and the sweet briar crept
up its walls; the wren and the phoebe bird built under its eaves.... Such was the state of
the Roost many years since, at the time when Diedrich Knickerbocker came into this neighborhood....
Mementoes of the sojourn of Diedrich Knickerbocker are still cherished at the Roost. His elbow
chair and antique writing desk maintain their place in the room he occupied, and his old cocked
hat still hangs on a peg against the wall."

[Sidenote: TARRYTOWN.]

From here to Tarrytown is but a little way. Tarwetown, "wheat-town." It is odd that two names
so dissimilar in sound as this and Greenburgh, and both of Dutch origin, should mean the same
thing. The Indian village here was Alipconck, "the place of elms." Like all this region the
place is full of the romance which Irving created, and of stirring incidents of Colonial and
Revolutionary days. Chief among these are the remains of the Philipse domain, the capture of
André and the legend of Sleepy Hollow, into which the old Dutch Church has been woven. The
church yard contains some beautiful monuments to the dead.

It is an odd coincidence that the Whitewood tree known as Major André's tree, near which the
capture was effected, was struck by lightning the day that news was received at Tarrytown of
Arnold's death. A monument now standing on the edge of the road has taken the place of the
tree. We all know how the Skinners, Paulding, Van Wart and Williams made this capture which
disclosed the treachery of Arnold. It was indeed a fortunate combination of circumstances that
led these three incorruptible men to the right spot at the right moment.

How many times did the death knell of independence seem on the point of being tolled, and how
many times did the god of chance throw his weight into the ascending scale of the Colonists.
But for a lapse of memory, the attempt of the British in the Summer of 1777 to capture the
Hudson Valley and separate New England from her sisters might have been as successful as it
proved disastrous. Lord George Germain sent Burgoyne peremptory instructions to proceed down
the Hudson, and the instructions to Howe to move north to meet him were equally peremptory,
but the latter were pigeonholed and forgotten for several weeks, and when remembered it was
too late. Washington had decoyed Howe to Pennsylvania, and Burgoyne, lacking the expected support
from the south, was defeated by the farmers.

Pocantico, "a run between two hills," the Dutch called it Sleepy Haven Kill, hence Sleepy Hollow.
"Far in the foldings of the hills winds this wizard stream," writes the grand sachem of all
the wizards, who wove the romance of the headless horseman and the luckless schoolmaster so
tightly about the spot that they are to-day part and parcel of it. The bridge over which the
scared pedagogue scurried was some rods further up the stream than is the present crossing,
for in those days the Post Road ran along the north side of the church, and the entrance was
originally on that side of the building, while now it is on the western end which faces the
present road.

The name Frederick Philipse was originally written Vreedryk, or Vrederyck, Felypsen, the former
meaning "rich in peace," indicating, we presume, the difference between his peaceful occupation
of breaking into the new wilderness and that of his ancestors in Bohemia who, being persecuted
for their religious opinions, fled to Holland, from whence Frederick emigrated to New Amsterdam,
some time before 1653, becoming a successful merchant, and later a patroon. Sen, meaning son
in Dutch, Felypsen meant the son of Felyp, Frederick the son of Philip. On the west bank of
the Pocantico Philipse built his first manorial residence, called Castle Philipse on account
of its strength and armament, it not only being loopholed for musketry, as was common in those
days, but was also defended by several small cannon. All these evidences of the strenuous days
of old have been covered by unsightly clapboards, and the place as it stands now looks as though
it might have seen better days, but gives no hint of its former important station. It is related
that in 1756 a Virginia colonel named Washington called here to pay his respects to the beautiful
Mary Philipse, but the lady saw nothing attractive in the tall, ungainly countryman. In 1784,
when the state parcelled out the confiscated lands of Philipse, this part fell into the hands
of Gerard C. Beekman, whose wife was Cornelia Van Cortlandt, a connection of the Philipse family.
An interesting incident connects this place with the André matter. Some time before his capture,
John Webb, one of Washington's aides, left a valise containing a new uniform with Mrs. Beekman,
asking that it be delivered only on a written order. Some two weeks later Joshua Het Smith,
whose loyalty was at that time regarded doubtful, called and asked for Lieutenant Webb's valise.
Mrs. Beekman disliked the man, and refused to deliver it without the order, which Smith could
not produce, and he rode away much disappointed. André was concealed in his house at this very
time, and the uniform was wanted to help him through the American lines. Thus Mrs. Beekman
forged the second link in the chain leading to the André capture.

The little old Dutch church is believed to be the oldest church edifice now standing in the
State. It was built in 1699 by Frederick Philipse. So long ago as 1705 it was necessary to
enact game laws for the protection of these animals, which were even then in a fair way to
being exterminated.

[Sidenote: ST. MARY'S CHURCH.]

The six miles to Ossining are largely made up of handsome estates lining both sides of the
road. Here and there nature still litters the earth with weeds and bushes, or the farmer tends
his crops, leaving a fringe of wild things to border his domains, but as a general thing such
inelegancies are suppressed, and the roadside is ordered with the same precision as are the
lands on the other side of the wall. Those pleasant little friendships with unkempt nature
are not so frequent as we find them further on. However, while there is little "delight in
disorder" there are many beautiful places belonging to those favored with an abundance of this
world's goods. Such names as Gen. John C. Fremont, Anson G. Phelps, Gen. James Watson Webb,
Aspinwall and others are or have been of this region. Some two miles before we come to the
village of Ossining stands St. Mary's Church, erected in 1850. Surrounded by tall trees, the
little edifice looks as though it might be some mysterious "church in the wood" of a medieval
romance, and one almost expects to see a little bridal party dash up on horseback with no time
to lose, in the belief that the grim old father is close on their heels. We naturally think
of a church as a centre of population, but here is a quaint little building which the traveler
comes on unexpectedly in a patch of woods by a rather lonely stretch of road. The temptation
to turn aside and investigate is strong until, the wind rubbing one tree trunk against another,
a long groan is heard that sends a cold shiver down the inquisitive's back and damps his ardor
for discovery. After all it's best out in the bright open road where the birds sing and the
sun dispels all thought of gloom.

[Sidenote: OSSINING.]

Ossining, "a stony place," was variously written Sin-sing, Sing Sing, Sin Sinck and Sink Sink.
Spelling was an incident in those days, not an art. Here again we must fall back on Irving
for our facts. He says: "A corruption of the old Indian name O-sin-sing. Some have rendered
it O-sin-sing, or O-sing-song, in token of its being a great market town, where anything may
be had for a mere song. Its present melodious alteration to Sing Sing is said to have been
made in compliment to a Yankee singing master who taught the inhabitants the art of singing
through the nose." The Indian village here bore the same name before the Dutch appropriated
the country.

No very important events of Colonial or Revolutionary history are recorded in immediate connection
with the town, though it is related that here is still preserved a small cannon known as "Old
White," said to be the one which, at Teller's Point, compelled the British Vulture to slip
her moorings and so leave André in the lurch. At one time mining operations were conducted
at this point, but they came to naught, and now the town is noted as a resort for guests of
the state.

[Sidenote: BLACK HORSE TAVERN.]

As we approach the Croton River the road takes a right-angled turn, down which a fingerboard
points, indicating that Peekskill lies that way, but the old Post Road kept straight ahead,
following the banks of the Croton until a favorable place for crossing occurred, when it took
advantage of the opportunity and started back for the Hudson, in order to get around Hessian
Hill. The marshy breadth of the Croton's mouth was probably too much for the bridge builders
of early days. Along this road a short half mile is the one-time celebrated Black Horse Tavern.
It was not only a house of refuge for travel-worn humanity, but was also a popular meeting
place for the neighboring farmers, and a place of political gatherings.

[Sidenote: VAN CORTLANDT MANOR.]

We stick to the more modern road which crosses the Croton by means of two bridges landing one
at the door yard of the old Van Cortlandt manor house. The view up the river from the bridge
is a beautifully soft landscape. On the left stands the old "ferry house," so important a means
of communication between the two sides of the stream that Washington, during the Revolution,
stationed a guard here for its protection. The manor house, a modest two-story building, hidden
in vines, built of the rough brown sandstone of the region, gives no indication of decrepit
age. It so happened that just before my visit its stucco covering had been removed, disclosing
to view the portholes for musketry intended to discourage the too enthusiastic approaches of
its Indian neighbors. This stucco was spread over the building when the grandfather of the
present generation of Van Cortlandts brought his bride home.

The father of the first "Lord of the Manor" was a landholder in the City of New Amsterdam,
owning a tract along Broadway where now is Cortlandt St. The son was the first mayor of New
York born in America; this was Stephanus Van Cortlandt. He advanced large sums of money to
the government, and as compensation obtained, in 1697, a Royal charter for "Lordship and Manor
of Cortlandt." The present building is thought to have been started by Gov. Thos. Dongan, about
1683, as a hunting lodge, an ideal situation on the bank of the Kitchawar, as the Croton River
was then known, protected alike from the north and east winds.

Irving says of the family at the time of the Revolutionary War:--

"Two members of this old and honorable family were conspicuous patriots throughout the Revolution.
Pierre Van Cortlandt, the father, at this time about fifty-six years of age, was a member of
the first Provincial Congress, and President of the Committee of Public Safety. Governor Tryon
had visited him in his old manor house at the mouth of the Croton, in 1774, and made him offers
of royal favors, honors, grants of land, etc., if he would abandon the popular cause. His offers
were nobly rejected. The Van Cortlandt family suffered in consequence, being at one time obliged
to abandon their manorial residence; but the head remained true to the cause, and subsequently
filled the office of Lieutenant-Governor with great dignity."

The history of the house records other interesting events besides those of war: From its high
veranda the great Whitefield preached to crowds who were seated on benches on the lawn. The
memory of this time has been kept green by a small brass plate, recording the fact, which is
attached to a post of the veranda.

The whole air of the place is so homelike and comfortable that the traveler could easily pass
it by never dreaming that the career of this vine-clad nest is one that many a more pretentious
dwelling would be proud to own to.

The old Van Cortlandt family cemetery is situated on a hill west of the house and west of the
road. Here lie the remains of that Mrs. Beekman whose distrust of Joshua Smith prevented him
from securing a disguise for André. Along the southern foot of this hill lies the Haunted Hollow.

[Sidenote: TELLER'S POINT.]

For-years "the walking sachems of Teller's Point" held nightly councils here, the ghosts of
departed Indians, whose last resting place on this Point was disturbed by the white man's plough
and spade, but their clay has long since been burned into bricks and their shades have scattered
in all directions; some of them no doubt looking down on us to-day from Manhattan's lofty skyscrapers.

An Indian castle or fort defended Teller's or Croton Point from up-river tribes, and it was
here that old Chief Croton died while defending the firesides of his people, he being the last
warrior to go down before the invaders. But though dead he yet walked, much to the inconvenience
of belated travelers, more especially those who, having passed a friendly evening with hospitable
neighbors, found it somewhat difficult to lay a straight course for home. However, nothing
has been heard of his ghostship of late, and it may be that the materialistic spirit of the
present age, which does not know a ghost when it sees one, has sent him off to some more happy
haunting ground.

[Sidenote: HESSIAN HILL.]

[Sidenote: ARNOLD-ANDRÉ MEETING.]

As the road winds up and over the western slope of Hessian Hill, just north of Croton Landing,
three panoramas follow each other in rapid succession, all strikingly beautiful. The first
two are different views of Teller's or Croton Point, with Hook Mountain and the Palisades in
the distance, that Teller's Point from whose banks Colonel Livingston bombarded the Vulture,
thereby leading to the capture of André, by this one action saving, possibly, the collapse
of the War for Independence. From a further spur of the same hill comes into view the broad
expanse of Haverstraw Bay with its background of jagged hills known as Clove Mountain and High
Tor, under whose shadow Arnold and André met. Elson's concise and graphic description of this
event is worth quoting as it stands: "On a dark night in September, 1780, Benedict Arnold lay
crouching beneath the trees on the bank of the Hudson a few miles below Stony Point, just outside
the American lines. Presently the plash of oars from the dark, silent river broke the stillness,
and a little boat bearing four men came to the shore. Two were ignorant oarsmen, who knew not
what they did, the third was the steersman, one Joshua Smith, who lived in the neighborhood,
while the fourth was a young and handsome man who concealed beneath his great overcoat the
brilliant uniform of a British officer. The young man, Major John André, adjutant-general of
the British army, was put ashore, and he and Arnold, who had long been secret correspondents,
spent the night in the dense darkness beneath the trees. Here the plot to place West Point
into British hands was consummated, and at the coming of dawn André did not return, as at first
intended, to the English sloop of war, the Vulture, which was lying in the river waiting for
him, but accompanied Arnold to the house of Smith, the steersman, a few miles away. Arnold
returned to West Point, and André waited his opportunity to reach the Vulture; but shore batteries
began firing on her, and Smith refused to venture out in his little boat."

[Sidenote: VERPLANCK'S POINT.]

Beyond Hessian Hill the road keeps inland along the high ground that slopes down to Verplanck's
Point, named after the son-in-law of Stephanus Van Cortlandt, to whose wife this part of the
estate fell. It is worth while to walk out to the brow of the hill for the sake of the view
and the historic memories it brings up. The "Kings Ferry" so often mentioned in the annals
of the Revolution connected this with a sandy cove on the north shore of Stony Point opposite--Stony
Point, "a lasting monument of the daring courage of Mad Anthony." The ferry made Verplanck's
Point an important spot, and naturally it was fortified as well as was Stony Point. Here Colonel
Livingston was in command in September, 1780, and it was he who, building better than he knew,
hurried the small cannon down to Teller's Point which, at break of day, drove the Vulture down
the river, the first link in the chain of events leading to the capture of André, for Smith,
his guide, becoming frightened, refused to put the Englishman on board the waiting sloop of
war, as agreed, and instead brought him across the King's Ferry to start him on his way to
New York on foot.

On October 5, 1777, Sir Henry Clinton landed three thousand men on Verplanck's Point, apparently
for the purpose of attacking Peekskill, but really with intent to deceive General Putnam, who
was in command of the town, and for once this Connecticut Yankee was fooled into doing just
what the enemy wished, for he drew his troops back to the hills and did not know until too
late that the English forces, under cover of a friendly fog, had been ferried across to the
west shore for the purpose of attacking Fort Montgomery. Clinton was on his way north with
all the troops that could be spared to help Burgoyne, and Putnam, who had the general command
of the Highlands, with only fifteen hundred men, could not hope to cope with the superior forces
advancing from the south, so he retired along the Post Road through Cortlandtville to Continental
Village, the main entrance by land to the Highlands, where the public stores and workshops
were located, and from which he was compelled to again fall back as Sir Henry Clinton, having
captured the river forts and burned Peekskill, advanced.

[Sidenote: PEEKSKILL.]

Peekskill on the one side of the river and Dunderberg on the other guard the lower end of the
Highlands. The town is named after the first settler, one Jan Peek, whose earliest mention
in history is as the builder of an inn in New York City, on Broadway near Exchange Place, in
sixteen hundred and something. It seems that Peek was something of an explorer and, when navigating
these waters, he mistook the present Peekskill Creek for the passage up the Hudson, entered
the creek and promptly ran aground, and, being aground, concluded to stay.

John Paulding, one of the three who captured André, received for his distinguished services,
as was meet, a fine farm situated in Peekskill that had been confiscated from its royalist
owner; thus we see that virtue is rewarded, treason punished and the state plays the generous
role without any expense to itself. Mr. Andrew Carnegie himself could not have managed the
affair better.

In September, 1777, the village was sacked and burned by the British and the neighboring country
was pillaged. The chapel of St. Peter's was erected on the site of the military magazine destroyed
at this time. The one historically interesting building that was left in the town, the old
Birdsall residence, has gone the way of all flesh. It was Washington's headquarters whenever
he was in this neighborhood, Lafayette dwelt under its roof, one of its parlors was used by
the Rev. George Whitefield in which to hold services, but the building protruded into the street
and the good people concluded that rather than walk around it any longer they would tramp over
its grave.

[Sidenote: CORTLANDTVILLE.]

In Cortlandtville is located the former residence of Gen. Pierre Van Cortlandt, erected in
1773. A tablet placed on the building says: "General George Washington with his aides slept
in this house many nights while making Peekskill their headquarters in 1776, 1777 and 1778.
It was the house of Pierre Van Cortlandt, member of Colonial Assembly, member of the 2d, 3d
and 4th Provincial Congress, President of the Committee of Public Safety, a framer of the State
Constitution, First Lieutenant-Governor of the State of New York, Colonel of manor of Cortlandt
Regiment." The building is rather modern in appearance, suggesting comfort rather than strenuosity.

Here the Van Cortlandt family found a safe asylum when the manor house on the Croton was no
longer tenable. In March, 1777, General McDougal posted his advance guard here when the British
took possession of Peekskill. Eighty of his men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Willet, receiving
permission to attack some two hundred of the British that had taken possession of a height
a little south of Cortlandt's, did so with such success that the enemy retreated, and the entire
command, some one thousand strong, becoming panic stricken, betook themselves to their shipping
under cover of the night and sailed down stream.

A great oak which served the purpose of a military whipping post, still stands just east of
the Van Cortlandt house.

The old parochial church of St. Peter's stands on the summit of a little hill near by, a simple
frame building erected in 1766 by Beverly Robinson and others as the result of a visit of Mr.
Dibble, of Stamford, Conn., in 1761. With him came St. George Talbot, who says: "The state
of religion I truly found deplorable enough. They were as sheep without a shepherd, a prey
to various sectaries, and enthusiastic lay teachers; there are many well wishers and professors
of the church among them, who doth not hear the liturgy in several years." In the church yard
stands the monument to John Paulding, one of the André captors, who was born in Peekskill.

Just east of the Van Cortlandt house the Post Road turns toward the north, where one of the
old mile-stones marks "50 m. from N. York." In the angle stands one of the inns of stagecoach
days which was standing as long ago as 1789, as in "A Survey of the Roads of the United States
of America," published by Christopher Colles in that year, the inn is put down as Dusenbury's
Tavern. The author of this old-time road book may have been something of a joker, or he may
have had a small grudge against the Presbyterians, as among the symbols he used, the one indicating
a church of that denomination is so noticeably like a windmill as to call forth a gentle smile.
The inn is now the dwelling of Mr. Gardiner Hollman, himself a relic of earlier days, who carries
his eighty years with an ease that bespeaks a life of steady habits. He is quite ready to show
the building to the curious and explain its interesting features. The front room on the right
is said to have held the prisoner André for a short time when he was being taken from North
Castle by way of Continental Village to the Beverly Robinson house, Arnold's former headquarters,
and used as such by Washington after the traitor fled. Aside from one or two old pieces of
furniture, and an open Franklin stove, the only interesting relic the room contains is a small
work-box which was given by Theodosia Burr to her friend Mrs. McDonald, of Alabama, who in
turn gave it to a sister of the present owner.

[Sidenote: GALLOWS HILL.]

From now on the Post Road is all that a country road should be. It plunges immediately into
a thicket of tall weeds, Joe Pie and goldenrod mostly, which shoot up in many instances six
feet above the ground. After crossing the creek the road begins the steep ascent of Gallows
Hill, where Putnam hanged a British spy in spite of Sir Henry Clinton's attempts to prevent
it. This summary action seems to have tempered the Red-coats' curiosity, as "Old Put" was not
bothered afterward. One of a small bunch of chestnut trees west of the road where it tops the
hill is pointed out as the gallows tree, although early accounts speak of a rough gallows having
been erected. There is a story to the effect that one Hans Anderson, a farmer of the neighborhood,
was the hangman, and that he was finally worried into his grave by the ghost of this same spy,
who would not leave him in peace; but no mention is made of the tough old General having been
so bothered.

[Sidenote: CONTINENTAL VILLAGE.]

Continental Village lies at the northern foot of Gallows Hill. The British destroyed the stores
the Americans were unable to take with them and burned the village, leaving, it is said, only
one house standing, the property of a Tory. Whether this building is still standing is somewhat
uncertain, though one is pointed out as such.

General Sir William Howe, in his dispatches to Sir Henry Clinton, dated at Fort Montgomery,
October 9, 1777, says: "Major-Gen. Tryon, who was detached this morning with Emmerick's chasseurs,
fifty yagers and royal fusiliers and regiment of Trumback, with a three-pounder, to destroy
the rebel settlement called the Continental village, has just returned and reported to me,
that he has burned the barrack for fifteen hundred men, several store-houses and loaded wagons.
I need not point out to your excellency the consequence of destroying this post, as it was
the only establishment of the rebels on that part of the Highlands, and the place from whence
any body of troops drew their supplies."

The place was soon reoccupied by the Americans as a point at which to collect stores, and various
military encampments were strung along both sides of the road from here north.

[Sidenote: POST ROAD.]

For the space of some two or three miles the road is a grass-grown track through a rough country.
As one proceeds he can appreciate the difficulties that beset the retreating soldiers, laden
with such stores from the village as they could carry with them on the retreat. Now and then
an unkept farmhouse appears, but there is little life; it is possible to walk as far as Nelson's
Mill, some eight miles, without passing a team of any sort, and hardly any one on foot, but,
like Goldsmith's village street the wayside is

     "With blossomed furze unprofitably gay."

Joe Pie weed, as heavy-headed as a sleepy child, alternating with the straight stemmed goldenrod,
while every wall is adorned with snapdragon or Virginia creeper, the scarlet product of the
deadly nightshade, or the silvery remains of the clematis--this in August or September. If
one goes this way in the Spring there is the wild azalea against the edge of the woods, and
the woodland flowers come trooping down even to the wheel tracks.

It is forty years since the telegraph abandoned this abandoned highway, and the tramps left
with the telegraph poles. One old inhabitant says it used to take a considerable part of her
time each day to feed the gentry who applied, for she, being afraid of them, never refused.
To-day, over this part of the road, the tramp is as scarce as the stage coach. To be sure the
law may have something to do with it, for any one who lodges information against a tramp gets
$15, and the gentleman of leisure presumably suffers accordingly, as the farmer is not likely
to assess himself merely for the pleasure of housing lazy humanity.

Just beyond the fifty-fourth mile-stone stands one of the old inns which is put down by Christopher
Colles as Travers's Tavern. It still offers shelter to him who will seek, as I discovered when
caught by a sudden shower.

From the last hilltop, before Nelson's Mill is reached, is a glorious view of the "Golden Gate,"
the notch between Storm King and Breakneck, through which the Hudson flows, and, in summer
floods of gold from the setting sun. On all sides are hills and valleys. It seems as though
the whole world is on edge.

Here stands sentinel a tall old mile-stone by the road side demanding of every one that passes
the countersign--Wonderful!

Down the steep hillside the road now lunges to Nelson's Mill or Corner, once a relay station
for the stage coach horses, and a mill site for many generations, and now we are looking up
at the mountains instead of down on them. The road floats up and down the gentle swells of
the valley's floor, each bend bringing into line another view of the Fishkill Mountain with
a new foreground or a different framing of leaves and branches, and each calling aloud to the
camera which gorges itself on trees and rocks and mountains.

[Sidenote: CLOVE CREEK VALLEY.]

We are in the valley of the Clove Creek, under the shadow of the Fishkill Mountain, in a hollow
where the dusk of evening comes early, and the gloom and solitude of the shortened day make
one readily understand why travelers of old halted at this north entrance to the Highlands,
rather than run the chance of being overtaken by the dark in the depths of its loneliness.
Cooper could hardly have hit on a more fitting place for the adventures of the Spy than these
woods and mountains offered.

[Sidenote: WICCOPEE PASS.]

About four miles south of Fishkill, in Wiccopee Pass, a bronze tablet by the roadside announces
that:--

     ON THE HILLS BACK OF THIS STONE STOOD THREE
     BATTERIES GUARDING THIS PASS, 1776-1783.

The hills referred to and others in the neighborhood are fifty to one hundred feet high, and
as smoothly rounded and regular as though moulded in a large-sized tea cup and turned out in
little groups, making one wonder what sort of giant children could have been playing here.
Legend relates that long, long ago, even before the mighty Manitou ruled, this region was peopled
by a great race as tall as the tall forest trees. They lived on roots and leaves and hunted
the great water rats that dwelt in houses built of mud and sticks in the lake that filled all
the country north of the Highlands. These animals were fierce fighters, and dangerous even
to their giant foes when the latter were caught at a disadvantage in the water, whither the
great men repaired for frequent bathing.

It was a give-and-take world in those days. The giants would square accounts at the first opportunity
by turning the next rat caught into funeral baked meat in remembrance of the departed brother,
and there the matter, as well as the rat, ended. But there came a time when a swarm of the
rats surprised a group of bathers, and there were many desolate firesides that night. Then
a great council was called to decide on a means of revenge, but as they could not swim and
boats were unknown, the concourse was like to break up with nothing accomplished when a daughter
of the tribe arose and suggested breaking down the barrier which held back the water, thus
putting the enemy on dry land, where he would be helpless. The plan was approved, and soon
all were at work at the narrowest spot with trees torn from the hill sides and such rough tools
as they could command, and now a small stream begins to work through which, washing out the
earth and smaller stones, becomes a flood thundering down the lower valley. In a few days the
region was drained and the enemy exterminated, but their houses remain even unto the present
time. The present Fishkill Mountain was the "long house" of the watery tribe gradually solidified
through the ages into the hardest of hard trap rock, and the little conical hills that we see
in the Wiccopee Pass were the play houses of the baby rats. But alas the giants, having no
longer any place to bathe, began to be troubled by a hardening of the skin and joints, and
their great bodies would at last fall to rise no more; but, as if in very mockery, whenever
a giant fell a spring of water would bubble from the ground and a rivulet would soon be searching
out a path for itself among the rocks and woods.

The traveler knowing nothing of the legend might suppose that sometime the waters swirled and
eddied over this region, and that our symmetrical little hills are deposits made at that time.

[Sidenote: REVOLUTIONARY BURIAL GROUND.]

[Sidenote: WHARTON HOUSE.]

The Post Road now passes through a fearsome piece of woods, coming out into the open again
where the mountain drops quickly to the plain, and we are in the sunshine once more. Looking
back at this time of day, about 7 o'clock of an early June evening, one sees a curious effect
of sunlight and shadow, against the dark mountain background, the sun outlines with vivid distinctness
every tree and bush or stone wall or weed with a silvery halo, and seems to intensify the fresh
verdure until all nature swims in green. Soon another of the old mile-stones appears, as usual
on the west side of the road, and opposite is a small granite monument which commemorates the
graveyard of the soldier dead in the adjoining field, where there are probably more revolutionary
dead buried than in any other spot in the State. This neighborhood was a headquarters for part
of the army between 1776 and 1783. A step further on is the Wharton House, known to both history
and romance. The building was used as army headquarters during the seven years that war raged
up and down the Hudson Valley. The names of both Washington and Lafayette are closely associated
with its history, and it is also the house referred to in Cooper's "Spy," from which Harvey
Birch helps Henry Wharton to escape. Here Enoch Crosby, the real spy, was subjected to a mock
trial by the Committee of Safety. Crosby had given information of a band of Tories and allowed
himself to be captured with them, was tried with them and, in order to keep up the deception
and preserve his usefulness, was remanded to the church-prison with the rest. The Wharton House
was erected by the Van Wyck family, and is still in its possession. In a wheat field across
the road lies the fallen stump of the "Whipping Post," a monument to the methods of correction
used in the Continental army. The next house to the north is said to be constructed of timber
taken from one of the old barracks.

The road over which we have been traveling was once an Indian trail. Shortly before the French
and Indian wars Lord Louden passed through this country, and in order to get his baggage train
through, the trail became a road under his direction.

[Sidenote: FISHKILL.]

The Fishkill Creek, which scuttles across the level floor of the valley just before one enters
the village seems in too much of a hurry to get away from its peaceful surroundings, which
are attractive enough to make mortals wish to linger, but which do not stay the brawling stream.
Both the mountains and the brook were the Indian Matteawan, the "Council of Good Fur," but
the Dutch christened it Vis Kill or Fish Creek, and the more musical native name had to give way.

The first house on the right after crossing the stream is one of the Colonial relics of the
place, but the principal buildings of interest are the Episcopal and Dutch churches. The first,
being frame, was used as a hospital during the Revolution. The Provincial Congress, when it
was compelled to leave White Plains, removed to Fishkill, and at first attempted to use this
church for its sessions, but the place had been so befouled by flocks of pigeons that a move
was made to the Dutch Church. It was during this time that Washington crossed the Delaware,
and he sent to the Congress sitting here for reinforcements, but no troops could be spared
from the defense of this region. The church bears a tablet which relates history, as follows:

"Trinity Church, organized in communion with the Church of England by the Rev. Samuel Seabury,
1756. The first rector Rev. John Beardsley, Oct. 26, 1766. Reincorporated Oct. 13, 1785, and
Oct. 16, 1796. This building was erected about 1760. Occupied by the New York Provincial Convention,
which removed from White Plains Sept. 3, 1776. Used for a military hospital by the army of
General Washington until disbanded June 2, 1783."

The Dutch Church was stone, and was soon used as a prison by the Americans. Probably the most
famous prisoner it contained was Enoch Crosby, the spy, the hero of Cooper's novel, who escaped
with the help of the Committee of Safety, the only ones who knew his true character. The second
time he was captured the officer in charge being nettled at his previous escape, had him guarded
with extra care, but again the Committee of Safety lent a helping hand and Crosby was free
once more.

Fishkill, settled in 1683, is one of the old towns. It was the largest town in the county during
the Revolution, and in 1789 was one of the seven postoffices in the state; but its glory has
departed and it is now a pleasant village living in its memories of the past. Here lived and
worked the blacksmith, J. Bailey, who forged General Washington's sword. Joshua Het Smith was
arrested here for his participation in the Arnold treason plot. The Dutch Church was built
about 1725, its roof then sloping up from all four sides to a cupola, holding a bell. The window
lights were small, set in iron frame (a good prison), and the upper story was pierced for muskets.
This was all changed soon after the Revolution, but the stout walls still remain.

[Sidenote: WAPPINGER FALLS.]

Beyond Fishkill the Post Road traverses a high plateau whose fertile soil is well cultivated,
a country beautiful after its kind, but to one fresh from the grandeur of the Highlands the
stretch of six miles to Wappinger Falls seems but a tame affair, with only one of the old mile-stones
left to tell the tale of long ago. This seemed to read "71 M. to N. York."

A country school was having recess as I went by, the master sitting in the shade outside reading,
while the boys were playing the national game and the one little girl stood by admiring their
prowess.

Wappinger Falls preserves the name of the Indian tribe that once held sway over these uplands.
The falls around which the village has grown up are lined with factories and factory ruins,
which latter lend an added charm to the natural beauty of the scene, for even in a dry time
water enough tumbles down these rocks to make the place a delight. The village contains an
interesting relic of the past in the old homestead of Peter Mesier, a New York merchant, who
settled here about the close of the Revolution.

Between here and Poughkeepsie the trolley plies. Its tracks run through the grass by the roadside,
the poles blend with the trees, and this usually unsightly modern convenience hardly mars the
beauty of the landscape.

Not a mile-stone was to be seen on this piece of road, but down by the river, at a corner of
the Livingstone Mansion, evidently taken from its original station on the old road nearby,
and marked "80 M. from N. York," reposes one of the lost guardians of the highway. The stones
appear to have all been set along the west side of the road, so that they were compass on a
cloudy day as well as distance markers, and a man had but to know his right hand from his left
to be sure of his direction.

[Sidenote: LIVINGSTONE HOUSE.]

The Livingstone house, built about 1714, stood on a point on the river bank on what is now
the southern edge of Poughkeepsie. Facing the south it overlooks the river for miles, while
in front was a sheltered little harbor for river craft, but this has been filled in by the
manufacturing concern that now owns the property, and nothing is as it was, except the house.
During the Revolution the place was the home of Henry Livingstone, whose well-known patriotism
led the British, when ascending the river in October, 1777, to bombard the building, as they
did so many others. One of its shingles, pierced by a shot at that time, has been left in place
as a reminder of the incident. It also draws attention to the difference between the hand-split
shingles of those days and the machine-sawed ones of the present.

[Sidenote: POUGHKEEPSIE.]

Poughkeepsie is the Apo-keep-sinck of the Indians, the "pleasant and safe harbor" where canoes
were safe from wind and wave. The name is said to be spelled some forty-two different ways
in the old town records. The "safe harbor" was made so by rocky bluffs projecting into the
river; that on the south being known to the Dutch as Call Rock, though it did not sound like
that in the vernacular. From this rock old Baltus Van Kleeck and his neighbors were wont to
hail passing sloops for news or passage.

An Indian legend associated with the little cove here has the same comfortable and satisfying
outcome as the old-fashioned romance, when it was not so necessary to be realistic as in the
present day. A war party of the Delawares, after a successful raid on their neighbors, the
Pequods, reached this spot on the return journey, laden with spoils and captives, among the
latter a young chief who, after the manner of most Indian tribes, was offered the choice of
joining the tribe of his foes or suffering death by torture. Being a Pequod Patrick Henry he
chose the latter, and preparations were made for his demise, when a beautiful maiden interfered.
She was also a captive from the same tribe, and much in love with her doomed tribesman. During
the delay thus caused the party was unexpectedly attacked by a band of Hurons, and the maiden
fell prize to the latter. The chief escaped, and disguising himself as a wizard, visited the
Huron camp where, strange to say, the maiden promptly fell ill upon the arrival of the strange
medicine man, who was employed to effect a cure. They fled under cover of the dark, appropriating
a handy canoe for the purpose, and the Hurons followed in the next boat, but the Pequod, landing
his beloved at the mouth of the Minnakee Creek, turned on his pursuers and, like the true hero
of legend, drove them off single handed. The lovers returned home, married, and lived happily
ever after.

Poughkeepsie, on account of its central position, was early chosen as the county seat, and
became the scene of many stirring incidents during the stirring times of '76. But few mementoes
of those days are left, however. The Van Kleeck house, at one time a tavern, used by the Dutchess
County Committee as a meeting place in 1774 to elect delegates to the first Continental Congress,
has disappeared. The Legislature in its migrations around the state met here in January, 1778,
at the call of Governor Clinton. Clinton himself, during this time, occupied the Clear Everett
House, which is still standing on Main Street, and is open to the public as a museum.

The great struggle which was to decide whether New York should join the newly formed National
Government was fought out in Poughkeepsie. On June 17, 1788, the Convention of the People of
the State met to deliberate on the new Constitution. Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and Chancellor
Livingston, a magnificent trio of pleaders, were the principal speakers in favor of the Union,
while Governor George Clinton and others, whose names are not familiar except to students of
history, headed the opposition. New York separated New England from the South, and was necessary
to the Union, but there was a powerful party headed by Governor Clinton which opposed the plan.
The Governor, in fact, had the majority with him, and when Hamilton and the others carried
the convention by only one vote, it was a greater victory than the narrow margin would indicate.
Poughkeepsie was a "safe harbor" in which to build ships, and it was here, in 1775-6, that
the frigates Congress and Montgomery of the Continental navy were built under the supervision
of Captains Lawrence and Tudor.

[Sidenote: HYDE PARK.]

Leaving Poughkeepsie the intervening six miles to Hyde Park are so park-like that the place
seems to come naturally by its name. The road is of the best, the bordering fields are under
a high state of cultivation, interspersed with groves of beautiful trees, through whose aisles
are to be seen occasional glimpses of the Hudson and, on a clear day, the distant Catskills
that, like low-lying clouds, top the nearer hills of the middle distance. The place is named
for Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, Governor of the Province at the beginning of the Eighteenth
Century. Jacobus Stoutenburg, the first settler, built a stone house which still stands on
the east side of the road in the southern edge of the village. It has the reputation of having
been a Washington headquarters, and is a fine example of a Colonial farm house. Only once during
the Revolution was there anything approaching a battle in Dutchess County, and that occurred
here during Vaughan's raid up the river, when he burned the landing and a shop or two. He was
opposed by a small body of Americans whom he bombarded from the river with no serious results.

James K. Paulding, author, and Morgan Lewis, Revolutionary general and chief justice of the
state, once lived in Hyde Park, as did Dr. Samuel Bard, Washington's physician, whose dwelling
is placed in Christopher Colles's road book, previously mentioned, as situated on the east
side of the Post Road, between the eighty-eighth and eighty-ninth mile-stones.

The next ten miles to Rhinebeck through Staatsburg covers a picturesque country, sometimes
too rough for much cultivation, but all the more attractive to the eye on that very account.

[Sidenote: STAATSBURG.]

Staatsburg or Pawlings Purchase: The earliest owner of this region that I find mentioned in
local histories was Henry Pawling, who died in 1695. His heirs sold the property in May, 1701,
to Dr. Samuel Staats, of New York City, and another. This was the son of Major Abram Staats,
of Albany, who figured largely in the early history of Columbia County. The only man of note
living here during Revolutionary days was Major John Pawling, a friend of Washington and an
active patriot. His stone house, built in 1761, still stands on the Post Road.

[Sidenote: RHINEBECK.]

Ryn Beck, Rein Beck, Rhynbeek, Reinebaik, Rhinebeck, was the name at first applied to that
region back from the river and located on the property of William Beekman, which was occupied
by the "High Dutchers," while in Kipsbergen, on the river bank, lived the "Low Dutchers."

In 1710 Colonel Robert Hunter, Governor of the Province, came over with a considerable colony
of Palatines from the Rhine country, some of whom settled on the Beekman property as above,
and are said to have given the place its name, which first appears in a deed of 1714.

[Sidenote: KIPSBERGEN.]

Kipsbergen: There is no evidence to show that any one settled here before 1700, though the
region was purchased from the Esopus Indians as early as 1686 by Jacobus and Hendrick Kip.
The Kips are said to have been great believers in large families, but, in spite of this, the
local chronicler states that a few years ago there was but one of the name left in the territory
of ancient Kipsbergen, and it is said that some of the land he possessed had never known any
owner but a Kip or an Indian. To-day Kipsbergen is only found on the older maps.

Landsman Kill may have been the boundary line between the High and Low Dutchers, Rhinebeck
and Kipsbergen. The name obtains either because its water power was reserved for the "Landsman"
or landlord, or because one Caspar Landsman, whose name appears in the early records may have
lived along its banks. The stream once ran a grist mill for Gen. Richard Montgomery.

A very interesting side excursion here, of some six or seven miles, starts toward the river
from the hotel corner in Rhinebeck, and comes out on the Post Road again a half mile or so
south of the starting point. It affords wonderful views of the Catskills and the Hudson, the
Shawungunk and lesser mountains toward the south. The property owners do not welcome the stranger
within their gates, but he is allowed to look over the fence to the views beyond.

Where the road turns south on the river bluff is the entrance to the Kip place, Anckany, named
for the Indian chief with whom the original Kip bartered for this property. An attractive old
stone house stands on the roadside here, but a quarter of a mile further on is the place that,
of all others, along the Post Road, retains the old-time atmosphere, the "Heermance" place,
built on Hendrick Kip's south lot in 1700. This is the house that Lossing says was erected
by William Beekman. The place soon (1716) passed into the possession of Hendricus Heermance,
and in due course to Henry Beekman, whose daughter became the mother of Chancellor Livingston.

A distinct line on the east end of the present building seems to indicate that the original
house was very small; the heavy sashes and the distorted little window panes of this old part
read a clear title back to the early days, which is duly confirmed by the iridescent condition
of the glass. Under the eaves, looking toward the river, were once two portholes; no indications
remain of one, but the other is a round opening large enough for the muzzle of a small cannon,
but so close to the roof as to make it seem improbable that it was ever intended for purposes
of defense. The present tenant remembers when this was a jagged hole without form or comeliness,
though at present it is a clean, round opening, and this suggests that there may be something
in Lossing's story that the hole was made by a cannon ball from one of General Vaughan's sloops
of war in 1777, though local authorities do not appear to place much credence in this theory.

[Sidenote: RHINECLIFF.]

The road continues south for some two miles through and beyond Rhinecliff, traversing beautiful
woods bordering Ex-Governor Morton's grounds, but before entering the woods comes a delightful
outlook toward Kingston and its mountain background that is all the more pleasing for its unexpectedness.
Still further, and opposite a schoolhouse, a road strikes off toward the south, and here is
the entrance to Wildercliff.

The Rev. Freeborn Garrettson, being invited to Rhinebeck to preach, met Catherine Livingston
while there, and in 1793 they were married. Six years later they purchased a place on the banks
of the Hudson, calling it Wildercliff--Wilder Klipp, a Dutch word meaning wild man's cliff,
from the fact that early settlers found on a smooth rock on the river shore a rough tracing
of two Indians with tomahawk and calumet. Garrettson was educated in the Church of England,
but left it to become a Methodist; a man of strong personality, he soon rose to a prominent
place in the church. Being a native of Maryland, he was naturally a slave owner, but becoming
convinced that slavery was bad, he set his blacks free. Wildercliff was the most noted gathering
place in the country for Methodists, and the house was always full. His daughter, Mary, kept
up the traditions of the place, and it is said such entertainment kept her poor.

The view down the river from here is something never to be forgotten; the dazzling effect of
the sun on the water, the hills of the further shore, and the grand expanse of the picture
which is only limited by the condition of the atmosphere, must be seen to be appreciated.

Returning toward the Post Road the highway passes through the Camp Meeting Woods, where the
Rev. Mr. Garrettson inaugurated those camp meetings which have made this spot as sacred to
the Methodist heart as is Wildercliff itself.

In the angle formed by the return road and the Post Road is an extensive estate--Grasmere--which
was planned and begun by Gen. Richard Montgomery who, however, did not live to enjoy the fruits
of his labor. His widow finished the house, but dwelt here for a short time only. The house
was burned in 1828 and rebuilt and enlarged in 1861-2. The Montgomerys originally lived in
a small cottage situated on the Post Road near the northern end of the village. The house has
disappeared, but the fact is commemorated in the present name of that portion of the highway.

A pleasant little story is told of General Montgomery's last days in Rhinebeck. His last Sunday
at home was spent with his brother-in-law, Livingston. When the General and his wife were about
to leave he thrust into the ground a willow stick he had been carrying, remarking with a laugh
that they could let it grow as a reminder of him until he came back. The General never returned,
but the stick grew to a great tree which has ever since been known as the Montgomery Willow.

[Sidenote: PINK'S CORNER.]

At Pink's Corner, in the northern edge of Rhinebeck, stands the "Stone Church" of the Lutherans,
built some time during the Revolution, but the church site is much older, as there are grave
stones in the burial ground dated as far back as 1733. The Post Road sweeps around the church,
and as one approaches from the south it looks as though he must needs go to church or take
to the fields.

[Sidenote: RED HOOK.]

It was thick weather when I traveled the country between Rhinebeck and Race Place, and the
mist hid the distant hills and dulled the nearby Autumn tints, with now and then a shower to
make the roads the better for the sprinkling. All nature had taken the veil, and there was
little to see beyond the adjoining fields, and these, lacking the magic touch of the sun, were
but dull companions. The towns, however, kept jogging past at frequent intervals, Red Hook
being first on the list, the first mention of which is in 1751, when certain baptisms are recorded
as occurring in Roode Hoek. The place is said to have its name from the fact that a marsh covered
with ripe cranberries was the first thing that caught the Dutch eye in this spot. As one passes
through the town he sees a guide-board pointing to Barrytown on the river, some three or four
miles away, where that Gen. John Armstrong once lived, the author of those celebrated addresses
published to the army at Newburg, which might have resulted in trouble among the troops had
it not been for Washington's level head.

There are some old buildings in Red Hook, but none of historic interest. It was here that I
passed the last of the old brown sandstone mile-stones; above here they are of some white stone
that looks like coarse marble, and from their general illegibility are evidently not as well
fitted to stand the rigorous northern climate as are their brown brothers from the south.

Upper Red Hook: The recorded history of most of these towns begins with the early church records.
When the population grew dense enough to warrant it, a new church organization would be formed
to accommodate those living in a neighborhood distant from the nearest house of worship, and
as soon as this happened the good dominie or the scribe of the church would begin to record
history; so of Upper Red Hook--all we know of its early beginnings, starting with a record
of baptisms in December, 1785, comes from this source.

The road now passes into Columbia County, where everything is, was, and ever shall be, Livingston.
The family manor is on the river bank, six miles away, but the family, like the locusts for
number, has spread up and down the river for a hundred miles or more.

In this county the Township of Livingston contains the villages of Claremont, after the manor
on the river; Johnstown, after John Livingston; and Linlithgow, after the old home in Scotland.
Dutchess County knows them and knows them well, likewise Westchester, while Rensselaer, on
the north, counts them among her prominent citizens.

[Sidenote: ROBERT LIVINGSTON.]

It appears that human nature was much the same two hundred years ago as at present. It is said
of Robert Livingston, first lord of the manor, that he "was shrewd, persistent and very acquisitive;
his zeal in this direction leading him sometimes to adopt questionable methods to advance his
interests. He always exerted himself to obtain riches and strove continually to promote his
family." But we have scripture for it that "men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself."
In March, 1711, Lord Clarendon wrote: "I think it unhappy that Colonel Hunter (Governor of
the Province) at his first arrival fell into so ill hands, for this Levingston has been known
many years in that province for a very ill man.... I am of opinion that if the substance proposed
be allowed, the consequences will be that Levingston and some others will get estates, the
Palatines will not be the richer."

[Sidenote: ANTI-RENT TROUBLES.]

The anti-rent troubles which occupied the attention of the state for one hundred and one years
began on the Livingston Estate in the Fall of 1751. The tenants first neglected, then refused
to pay rent. The boundary line between New York and Massachusetts was in dispute, both Provinces
claiming this territory; and the malcontents, taking advantage of this to get some sort of
title to their farms from the "Committee of the General Court of the Province of Massachusetts
Bay," defied Robert Livingston Jr., the then proprietor, and a hard time he had of it to deal
with both the discontented farmers and the government of the adjoining Province, New York being
slow to take up the cudgels in his behalf.

From here the trouble spread to the Van Rensselaer and other manors, resulting in riots and
small-sized warfare, with now and then the murder of a sheriff on the one side or an anti-renter
on the other. The matter got into state politics and finally, in 1846, the tenants elected
their Governor, and in 1852 the Court of Appeals decided in favor of the tenants, and the trouble
was laid to rest.

Among the notables of Columbia County was Samuel J. Tilden, who was born and raised here, but
who early gravitated to New York City. The local historian also sets great store by the Hon.
Elisha Williams who, during the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, was the bright particular
star of the Columbia County Bar.

[Sidenote: FIRST "STAGE-WAGGONS".]

In 1786 the first systematic attempt to run stages over the Post Road appears to have been
made by three Columbia County men, Isaac Van Wyck, Talmage Hall and John Kinney, as in that
year the state granted to these men the exclusive right "to erect, set up, carry on and drive
stage-waggons" between New York and Albany on the east side of Hudson's River, etc., fare limited
to 4 pence per mile, trips once a week. Right here it is interesting to note that in 1866 Lossing
wrote of the Hudson River Railway that "more than a dozen trains each way pass over portions
of the road in the course of twenty-four hours."

[Sidenote: NEVIS--CLAREMONT--BLUE STORE.]

Nevis is little more than a cross-roads. Claremont a straggling village of no moment; further
on the road crosses the Roeloff Jansen Kill over a bridge that looks as though it must have
heard the rumble of many a stage coach.

Some newspaper antiquarian says:--

"Kill seems to be a Low Dutch word of American coinage. I have never found the word kill for
brook in Low Dutch or Low German writings. I think they originally pronounced it 'küll' (cool),
and to a people transplanted from a low country to a mountainous one, where the water of the
brooks was cool even in midsummer, the suggestion may be plausible. The Low Dutch have 'vliet'
(fleet) for stream. The German for streaming is 'strömen.' Hamburg has its numerous fleets
or canals. The Low German of the Lünenburger Helde calls a brook a streak or a 'beek.' Note
the word 'Beekman.'"

A hundred years or more ago, when they were naming things in these parts, Blue Store was blue
store, and they keep up the tradition faithfully to-day. Everything except what nature tints
is the favorite color. This was one of the principal stopping places on the Post Road, but
it has sadly dwindled since the old days.

[Sidenote: JOHNSTOWN--RACE PLACE.]

Johnstown contains three Livingston houses, built by various members of this omnipresent family.
The one north of the village stands on a commanding hill, and looks from the road like a handsome
place. In 1805 there were twenty public houses in this place, even members of the reigning
family consenting to take in the sheckels over the bar.

It has been interesting to see the chickens scurry for cover whenever a noisy flock of blackbirds
passes overhead on its way to the southland. They seemed to think, if chickens think, that
all the hawks in christendom were swooping down on their devoted heads, and stood not on the
order of their going.

[Sidenote: COLD NIGHT.]

Race Place is a half mile off the road, but being garnished with a hotel I went there for the
night. The village centre consists of two dwellings, two blacksmith shops and the hotel, which
carries the legend "Race Place Hotel, 1700," and its interior bears out the aged suggestion.
The parlor floor has sagged a foot or so, due to the crowds that have assembled here during
past country balls. The ballroom is on the second floor, where one would naturally expect to
find bedrooms, and the proprietor proudly announced that as many as sixty couples had danced
here at once; there must have been some hearty bumps during the process. There are three bedrooms
tucked away in recesses at the rear. It was my lot to sleep in a feather bed under a mountain
of patchwork quilts with never a care for Jack Frost sitting on the window ledge outside. But,
oh! what a difference in the morning, when I must climb out of that nice, warm nest to shut
the window, catching a scrap of conversation in doing so, the burden of which was, "ice an
inch thick." Think of shaving and washing in water that has spent the night in such company!

The proprietor of the hotel thinks walking through the country is all right and perfectly safe
provided the traveler keeps away from those large hotels where they burn gas. Gas is dangerous.
Two of his friends and neighbors went on a visit to Albany and, as he put it, came home in
pine boxes. Keep away from gas-lit hotels and you are all right. The kitchen was the only place
in the house where an overcoat was not de rigeur, and there the evening was passed with the
family. There was much edifying conversation and considerable speculation over a stuffed olive
which the daughter of the house had brought home from school; the housewife feared to taste
it and the good man had no curiosity to gratify.

[Sidenote: STONE MILL--CLAVERACK.]

Stone Mill, on Claverack Creek, so named because of the old stone mill built in 1766, is a
postoffice, but why, in these days of rural free delivery, is not quite clear, as the miller
has but two or three neighbors who live in sight.

[Sidenote: CLAVERACK.]

Claverack, Clover-reach--the town is one of the oldest--was once the county seat, until Hudson
captured the prize. With what scorn must the staid Dutchmen have looked on the hustling Yankees
who almost built the greatest city of the region over night.

As early as 1629 the Hollanders looked on this land and found it good. It was part of the Van
Rensselaer grants, this region in time coming to be known as the Lower Manor. The settlers
here appear to have come with money and servants, and to have been better provided for than
most of those who broke into the wilderness. Early descriptions suggest a land flowing with
milk and honey. Deer were so plenty that one could be had from the Indians for a loaf of bread;
turkeys, pheasants, quail, hares and squirrels were everywhere; forest trees were festooned
with grape vines; blackberries, strawberries, wild plums and nut trees abounded, and the streams
were full of most excellent fish.

The soil was fertile, and the community soon became a flourishing one, and the centre of interest
and the county seat. The fine courthouse, erected in 1786 and still standing, was the scene
of some notable legal contests, the most memorable being the trial of Harry Croswell, editor
of the Hudson Balance, in 1804, charged with libel upon President Jefferson. The prosecution
was handled by Ambrose Spencer, Attorney-General, and the newspaper man was defended by William
H. Van Ness and Alexander Hamilton, whose eloquence failed to save the accused. In 1805 Hudson
became the county seat, and the courthouse was abandoned to private use.

The village still contains a number of notably fine specimens of Colonial architecture, one
of which is the Ludlow house, built in 1786. The present Ludlow, a grandson of Robert Fulton,
having some money and much leisure, has turned the old place into a Fulton museum. The Miller
house, formerly Muldor, an interesting relic of the year 1767, is known as the Court Martial
House, it having been used for the trial and its cellar for the imprisonment of delinquents
during the Revolution, the owner himself being among those who suffered, he being given the
choice of paying $1,000 or serving two months. This appears to have been because the gentleman
shirked his military duties. His thoughts on the subject of being haled a prisoner to his own
cellar do not appear to have been recorded; possibly they would not look well in print, as
it was written by an early traveler through this region that the inhabitants were much "addicted
to misusing the blessed name of God." Mr. Miller, if inclined that way, certainly was afforded
every opportunity. Other attractive places are the Webb house, erected about 1790; the Old
Stone House, on the Post Road, formerly an inn, said to be haunted by the ghost of a murdered
pedler, and the Dutch Church, 1767, in the northern edge of the village. In fact, buildings
a hundred years old are too frequent to excite remark. Gen. James Watson Webb, whose father,
Gen. Samuel B. Webb, was wounded on Bunker Hill, was born here, as was Judge William P. Van
Ness, Aaron Burr's second in the Hamilton duel, and many another man known to fame.

[Sidenote: HUDSON.]

It is but a short distance to Hudson, whose history is so interestingly different from that
of the other towns of the region that a few words concerning it may not be out of place, even
if the Post Road does pass by on the other side. Here, in 1783, came certain Quakers from Providence
and Newport, Nantucket and Edgartown. It seems that the British cruisers had crippled the whaling
industry and other marine ventures in which these enterprising gentlemen were engaged, and
they sought a more secluded haven from which to transact their business. Some of them brought,
on the brig "Comet," houses framed and ready for immediate erection, but before placing them
these methodical Quakers first laid out the town in regular form, establishing highways, and
not allowing them to develop from cow paths, as was the honest Dutch fashion. A committee was
appointed "to survey and plot the city," and another to see that the streets were given suitable
names. A canoe ferry satisfied the earlier settlers, but "a gunwaled scow" was none too good
for the new comers.

In 1785 it was the second port in the state; two ship yards were established, and a large ship,
the Hudson, was nearly ready for launching. The fame of its hustle was attracting people from
every side. March 31, 1785, the first newspaper was issued; April 22, 1785, a legislative act
incorporated the place into a city; and by January, 1786, they had finished an aqueduct to
bring in an abundant supply of pure water from two miles back in the country.

In 1790 it was made a port of entry. In 1793 the Bank of Columbia was chartered; in 1796-7
the city issued small bills and copper coins.

Hudson was incorporated the third city in the State, was the third port of entry, and had one
of the three banks in the State. Once it started on the down grade, however, its "decline and
fall off" was equally rapid.

[Sidenote: POST ROAD.]

Now to get back to the Post Road, where the pace is not quite so hot-foot. As the next town
is Kinderhook, some fourteen miles away, there is plenty of time to view the beauties of nature
and fill one's nostrils with its rich perfumes. Most of the year's work in the fields is finished;
here and there the shocks are being overhauled for the corn, which is shucked as gathered,
while the pumpkins are still accumulating sunshine for the golden Thanksgiving pie. From the
barn yards come the pounding of the steam thresher or the creak of a windlass, suggesting that
the hay crop is being baled. Everything is busy but the cows, who evidently do not like frosting
on their cake and, having the day before them, can afford to wait till the good sun comes along
to undo the work which has kept Jack Frost so busy all night.

The Catskills or Blue Mountains, as they are known from this distance, fill the western horizon,
while the beautiful landscapes sloping down toward the river are so exquisite that the traveler
involuntarily pauses to take it all in. For a goodly portion of the time the road keeps well
up along a side hill, giving an extensive view over the valley beneath and to the mountains
beyond--the autumn colors and softness are like the fairy dreams of childhood. With the blood
dancing under the influence of the brisk morning air, walking is a luxury, and the glow that
comes with the exercise, as well as every sight and sound, a new found joy.

The people hereabouts, while used to all sorts of freaks, can hardly understand how one can
idly walk through the country with no higher ambition than the taking of a picture here and
there, and many are the questions to be answered as to the whyness of the whichness, the old
farmer generally going on with a dubious shake of the head, convinced that there is a screw
loose somewhere.

[Sidenote: FARMER FOLK.]

A farmer, on whose load of potatoes I rode into Kinderhook, thinks farming doesn't pay--would
have been better off if he had worked at days' work all this time. He was cheerful, however,
and wholly free from care; his horses were not matched, one doing all the pulling, the other
all the sojering, and they went their own gait without interference from him. "Apples! Why
apples aren't worth picking this year." It happened that I fell in with the other kind near
Stone Mill. He made $1,000 from apples alone last year; would not make so much this season,
but they were well worth the gathering; there was money in the ground for him. The individual
seems to count in farming, same as in everything else.

Just out of Claremont a young fellow was thrown from his runabout, his horse being frightened
at an automobile, and it was only the quickness of the chauffeur that saved him from being
run over. Did he curse the rich man's machine? Not he! His only idea was to find another and
show his "new animal" who was master! Aside from this irritating feature, the whole affair
was a huge joke on him. He was as handsome and wholesome looking as good health and an outdoor
life could make a man.

[Sidenote: LINDENWALD--JESSE MERWIN.]

Some two miles out of Kinderhook stands Lindenwald, to which Ex-President Van Buren retired.
The house was built by Judge William P. Van Ness, previously mentioned. Washington Irving was
a welcome and frequent guest in the Van Ness household, and it was in this neighborhood that
he became acquainted with Jesse Merwin, school teacher, prototype of Ichabod Crane in the "Legend
of Sleepy Hollow." The two men were the best of friends, and the caricature does not seem to
have cooled their pleasant relations. The schoolhouse stands on the roadside, somewhat nearer
the village; at least the building pointed out as such is there, but in a letter to Merwin,
Irving regrets that the old schoolhouse is torn down "where, after my morning's literary task
was over, I used to come and wait for you, occasionally, until school was dismissed. You would
promise to keep back the punishment of some little tough, broad-bottomed Dutch boy, until I
could come, for my amusement--but never kept your promise."

The following notice of the death of "Ichabod Crane" appeared in the Westchester Herald for
November 30, 1852:

"Jesse Merwin died at Kinderhook on the 8th instant, at the age of seventy years. Mr. Merwin
was well known in this community as an upright, honorable man, in whom there was no guile.
He was for many years a Justice of the Peace, the duties of which office he discharged with
scrupulous fidelity and conscientious regard to the just claims of suitors, ever frowning upon
those whose vocation it is to "foment discord and perplex right." At an early period of his
life, and while engaged in school teaching, he passed much of his time in the society of Washington
Irving, then a preceptor in the family of the late Judge Van Ness, of this town.

"Both were engaged in congenial pursuits and, their residences being only a short distance
apart, the author of the 'Sketch Book' frequently visited the 'Old Schoolhouse,' in which 'Squire
Merwin' was employed in teaching the young idea how to shoot, and subsequently immortalized
his name by making him the hero of one of his inimitable tales, 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.'"

[Sidenote: KATRINA VAN TASSEL HOUSE.]

A step further on, and across the highway, stands the Katrina Van Tassel house, on whose blooming
young mistress the Yankee pedagogue was wont to cast longing eyes; this is the old Van Allen
house, built in 1717, says one, in 1735 according to another--a plain building whose Holland
bricks are still good, though somewhat the worse for wear.

Soon the road crosses the Kinderhook Creek into the village by an ancient covered bridge which
has echoed to the thunder of many an old "stage-wagon." The crossing is rather a long one,
resulting in two bridges with an interval of open between them. Down below the stream rolls
lazily along while the cattle, standing at ease, seem to catch its indolent spirit. These streams,
affording opportunity for water power, appear to have drawn the settlers away from the banks
of the great river, and thus the towns grew up well inland from its shores. Between Staatsburg
and Greenbush, a matter of fifty-six miles, we find only five towns on the river's edge, while
back, along the Post Road, or in its immediate vicinity, are some twenty villages both great
and small.

[Sidenote: KINDERHOOK.]

Kinderhook--Children's Corner--as musical and attractive a name as one could ask. It is said
that a Dutchman once lived hereabouts whose progeny was so numerous as to attract attention,
even in the days of large families, and so the place came by its name as a matter of course.

Being a stranger in a strange land, I early sought out the good Dr. C., who did not at first
seem as genial as anticipation had pictured, but finding, as the purpose of the call was explained,
how truly harmless was the intent, he suggested a tour of the village in his company, confiding
as we reached the outer air that he was so glad it was not a book agent who had called; that
he was delighted to do all he could, and so it proved, for he could do and did all and more
than most would feel called upon to do for the casual stranger.

[Sidenote: MARTIN VAN BUREN.]

Abraham Van Buren, father of Martin, was one of the early tavern keepers of Kinderhook, and
here the son was born and educated to the law. His dwelling place is pointed out, and it is
truly the site but not the substance, as the old building has fallen victim to the march of
improvement.

Elson says of Martin Van Buren:--

"He was a man of greater individuality and ability than is generally put to his credit by historians....
In the Cabinet of Jackson he was by no means a figurehead even there, for it was largely due
to his skill that Jackson made the two brilliant strokes in his foreign policy.... Van Buren
has been pronounced the cleverest political manager in American history, and no other man has
held so many high political offices. He was small of stature, had a round, red face and quick,
searching eyes. He was subtle, courteous and smooth in conversation."

[Sidenote: PARSONAGE-FORT.]

As early as 1670 Hollanders settled here. The first interesting house one meets on entering
the village from the south is the old Dutch parsonage which, being of brick, was a tower of
strength against the Indians as well as the Devil. The Indians raided this region in 1755 and
visited the neighborhood of Kinderhook at a time when the men were away, but their stout-hearted
wives and daughters were equal to the occasion; for, donning such male attire as they could
find and shouldering the family arms, they made such a brave show in and about the fort that
the Indians retired without attempting its capture. A short distance east of this stands another
old parsonage-fort, but little or nothing seems to be known concerning its history, though
legend mentions its cellar door as bearing the marks of Indian tomahawks. It is said to be
a fact that the heavy timbers in some of these old houses were imported from Holland to these
heavily wooded banks of the Hudson.

[Sidenote: CENTENNIAL MANSION.]

On the pleasantest street of the village stands the Centennial Mansion, opposite the Dutch
Church, erected in 1774 by Daniel Van Schaack. The house has been the social centre of the
town for more than a hundred years. One of its earliest associations concerns the visit of
General Richard Montgomery, when on his way to take command of the army against Canada. Henry
Van Schaack, a brother of Daniel, was an intimate friend of the General, they having been thrown
together while in the Seventeenth Regiment in the war of 1755.

In October, 1777, General Burgoyne, a prisoner of war, was quartered here for a short time,
and during the following years a long list of prominent men passed through its hospitable portals:
John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, Philip Schuyler, Chancellor Kent and others.

After the Van Schaack régime had passed came the Hon. Cornelius P. Van Ness, who in due time
became chief justice of the Supreme Court of Vermont, then its Governor, and later was minister
to Spain. Washington Irving arouses the ire of the local historian by stating that the Van
Ness ancestors came by their name because they were "valiant robbers of birds' nests." The
next owner was a merry gentleman whose ghost is said to still haunt the sideboard.

Then came Dr. John P. Beekman, whose first wife was a Van Schaack. He added the two wings which
adorn either end of the building; and again its doors are opened wide, sharing, with Lindenwald,
the honor of entertaining the nation's notables, many of them introduced by Van Buren. Such
names as Henry Clay, Washington Irving, Thomas H. Benton, David Wilmot and Charles Sumner head
the list. David Wilmot was a notably corpulent gentleman; his introduction by Van Buren to
the lady of the house is said to have been put thus wise: "Mrs. Beekman, you have heard of
the Wilmot Proviso--Here he is in the body."

The house is now occupied by the widow of Aaron J. Vanderpoel, a Van Schaack grand-daughter.

From the "Reminiscences" of a Kinderhooker we learn that there were two or three stage lines
whose coaches passed through the village daily, and that the merits of their various steeds
were the cause of much local controversy around the tavern stove. The drivers "were mainly
farmers' sons, many of them well to do, selected with special reference to sobriety as well
as in handling the ribbons;" and the heart of every lad in the village was fired with the hope
that some day he might be selected to fill that high office.

Starting again on the Post Road toward the north, we come to the one-time Kinderhook Academy,
celebrated in its day, but its day has passed, and on the outskirts of the town pass the old
cemetery where Martin Van Buren and Jesse Merwin lie with the forefathers of the neighborhood.

[Sidenote: WE LEAVE THE POST ROAD.]

Here we part from the old Post Road, which continues on through Valatie, Niverville and South
Schodack to Schodack Centre, where it joins company with the Boston Road, and together they
travel through East Greenbush to Greenbush where once was the ferry at Crawlier.

The way I took through Muitzeskill and Castleton to Greenbush, is marked with New York and
Albany guide posts, but none of the old mile-stones adorn its path.

Ever since Rhinebeck the Catskills have been marching along the western horizon, and while
generally the river is too far away to be a part of the picture, the country, the beautiful
country, makes one continually wonder, not that the painters of a past generation grew to love
the region and to revel in its seductive delights, but rather that they could ever stop its
delineation. The effect of the changing light and shade and varying atmospheric conditions
lend the same enchantment that lies in the ever-changing sea.

[Sidenote: THE DISTANT HILLS.]

About where that mystery, the county line, crosses the road, one stands on a gentle ridge that
extends the view both east and west. Toward the latter, on this Indian Summer day were the
ghosts of mountains that in brighter times are the Catskills, while to the east are the low-lying
hills of the Taghkanic range, whose far slopes roll down to meet the advances of the Berkshires.
Beautiful undulating farm lands lead the eye up to the distant hills on either hand, fields
of every warm tint with sentinel oaks or walnuts, and here and there the wood-lot of the farmer.
The soft browns and greens of the distant corn stubble, or the winter barley fields with the
blaze of the Frost King's robes mellowed by the golden sun complete a picture common enough
in this wonderful valley of the Hudson, but always a well-spring of delight for the traveler.

[Sidenote: MUITZESKILL.]

After crossing into Rensselaer County the first village one comes in contact with is Muitzeskill,
whose burial ground is old enough to be interesting to the searcher for curious epitaphs. All
country places have their odd characters, and this region is no exception. Among the elegant
extracts quoted as dropping from the lips of its citizens is the remark of a certain Michael
Younghans, hotel keeper, who declaiming about certain improvements he was thinking of, said
that he was "A-going to get carpenters to impair his house, firiquelly it in front, open pizarro
all round, up-an-dicular posts on a new destruction." What was to happen after that no man knoweth.

[Sidenote: FIREPLACE OF THE NATION.]

This rolling country was once the council seat of the Mohicans, this fact being commemorated
in the name of Schodack, a Dutch rendering of the Indian word Esquatak, "the fireplace of the
nation." The Mohicans had been pretty thoroughly "pacified" by the Mohawks about the time that
Hudson ascended the river, and this region is full of legends of fights and ambuscades.

It seems that Burgoyne's captured army was marched south over this road, and some three miles
out of Castleton, so the story goes, one Jacob Jahn, a Hessian prisoner, escaped to the woods
and later, building a log house on the exact spot where he effected his escape, he settled
down, after taking unto himself a wife, and became a good citizen.

The road follows the level table land almost to the Hudson, when it dips down a steep incline,
crosses the Muitzes Kill and joins the river road. Once upon a time, as history records, as
an excitable Dutch vrouw was wending her way along the banks of this brook, a sudden gust of
wind caught up her cap, the pride of her heart, and whisked it into the water beyond reach,
whereupon she set up an outcry, "Die muts is in die kill! Die muts is in die kill!" and so
it is even unto this day. What kind of a name the stream might now be murmuring under, had
this adventure befallen her good man is fearful to think on.

[Sidenote: CASTLETON.]

It is Castleton because the Indians once had a castle on the crest of the hill back of the
village. The town is comparatively new, having been incorporated as late as 1827, and appears
to have taken no important or interesting part in the days when history was making; but there
was a ship yard here, and home-built sloops competed for the New York trade before the railroad
changed things.

It is told of a certain foolish citizen, a passenger on one of the village sloops anchored
for the night somewhere in the Highlands, that, being requested by the wag of the party to
steer the stationary boat while the others took needed rest, he faithfully performed his task
until relieved the next morning. When asked by his shipmates how they had got on during the
night he replied that they had got along a good ways by the water, but not far by the land.

Castleton is one long street which wanders out into the open country at either end, and lonely
country it is if one proceeds north as the early twilight of a cool November evening is closing
around. The wayfarer, if he be of a fearful temperament and has read the story of the Murder
Place, is apt to quicken his steps as he passes into the shadows of the trees that gloom the
crossing of the stream marking the northern boundary of the village, and known as the Hell
Hole. On the right are abrupt little hills, wooded and awesome, while off toward the west stretch
the flats left by the river, with now and then a silent pool to reflect the dying embers of
the burned-out day. No light gleams from a friendly window, only the shadowy form of a hay
rake left out by some farmer suggests human companionship. With eight miles of such traveling
ahead, it is small wonder if the wayfarer hastens.

[Sidenote: "CITIZEN" GENET.]

About half-way, where one passes a schoolhouse overlooking the flats and the guide board says
3-1/2 miles to Castleton, once lived "Citizen" Genet, and his house still stands a quarter
of a mile back on Prospect Hill, facing the cross road to East Greenbush. Edmond Charles Genet
was sent out to this country in the Spring of 1793 by the new French Republic. Things moved
rapidly in France in those days, and Genet's friends were soon removed and he, fearing the
guillotine, became an American citizen, "a scientific farmer and an ornament to New York society."
In 1810 he moved to Greenbush, where he died in 1834. His tombstone in the burial ground of
the Dutch Church in East Greenbush tells us that "His heart was love and friendship's sun."
His house was once the home of Gen. Hendrick K. Van Rensselaer, whose bravery at Fort Ann saved
the American army in 1777.

Part of the flat lands we have been skirting go to make up the long island of Paps Knee, which
was early selected as a place of refuge. Here a fort was built and farms were laid out, but
in 1666 a flood swept away houses and cattle, and since then the farmers have lived on the
higher main land; only one brick house, the fort, escaped and that still stands, bearing its
two hundred and seventy-five years with the grace of long practice.

Where the road works down to meet the river comes Douw's Point, once the head of steamboat
navigation; passengers for Albany and beyond going forward in stages after crossing the river
in a horse ferryboat. It is whispered that a few rods below the point Captain Kidd buried treasures.
Old Volkert P. Douw was so staunch a patriot that he refused to hold office under the English,
and gave his money and his time to the American cause.

[Sidenote: FORT CRALO.]

[Sidenote: YANKEE DOODLE.]

In the lower edge of the village of Greenbush and on the River Road which we are following
stands the most interesting building of the region, old Fort Cralo, built in 1642 for protection
against the Indians. Its white oak beams are said to be eighteen inches square and its walls
two to three feet thick. Some of its portholes still remain as reminders of the times of the
war whoop and scalp dance. It is said there were once secret passages to the river, which is
just across the road. During the last of the French and Indian wars Major-General James Abercrombie
had his headquarters here--1758; and it was here that Yankee Doodle came into being. Among
the Colonial regiments which joined the regulars at this point were some from Connecticut whose
appearance became a by-word among the well-kept British troops. The song was composed by a
surgeon attached to the army, as a satire on these ragged provincials; less than twenty years
later the captured soldiers of Burgoyne marched between the lines of the victorious Yankees
to the same tune.

It is but a step to the trolley, and in a brief five minutes we are across "The Great River
of the Mountains" as Hudson called it, and at our journey's end.

[Sidenote: SCHUYLER--VAN RENSSELAER.]

The man who can rise superior to feelings of personal grievance, or even just anger, is the
man we all admire. Such, history says, was Gen. Philip Schuyler who, when Burgoyne had wantonly
burned his country seat near Saratoga, entertained that same Burgoyne after his capture in
his town house, which still stands at the head of Schuyler Street, Albany, in so hospitable
a fashion that the British General, struck with the American's generosity, said to him: "You
show me great kindness though I have done you much injury," whereupon Schuyler returned: "That
was the fate of war; let us say no more about it." This house was erected about 1765, and General
Schuyler lived here with his family for nearly forty years, dispensing such notable hospitality
as to call down the blessings of many a traveler to and from Canada or the West.

The Van Rensselaer Manor House stood on the river bank, but nothing is now left of it but the
little old brick office, which stands disconsolate along the street, watching through half-closed
blinds the great woodworking plant which occupies the site of the old home of the Patroon.

One other reminder of the days gone by still survives in the Peter Schuyler house in the northern
limits of Albany, at the Flats. Lossing says of this: "It is famous in Colonial history as
the residence of Col. Peter Schuyler, of the Flats, the first mayor of Albany, and who, as
Indian Commissioner in after years took four kings or sachems of the Mohawks to England and
presented them at the court of Queen Anne."

[Sidenote: IT IS FINISHED.]

And now we have finished, and there is naught to do but return home, and various are the ways
of doing it. If time is of no moment there is the west bank of the Hudson to explore all the
way down to Paulus Hook, from whence the ferry will easily land one once more on the Island
of Manhattan. If time counts, the night boat is a simple solution of the problem.
