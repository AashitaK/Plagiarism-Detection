Presently tall columns of steam burst from the 'scape-pipes of both steamers, two guns boom
a good-bye, two red-shirted heroes mounted on capstans wave their small flags above the massed
crews on the forecastles, two plaintive solos linger on the air a few waiting seconds, two
mighty choruses burst forth--and here they come! Brass bands bray Hail Columbia, huzza after
huzza thunders from the shores, and the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind.

Those boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and St. Louis, except for a second
or two at large towns, or to hitch thirty-cord wood- boats alongside.  You should be on board
when they take a couple of those wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of men into each; by the
time you have wiped your glasses and put them on, you will be wondering what has become of
that wood.

Two nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other day after day. They might even
stay side by side, but for the fact that pilots are not all alike, and the smartest pilots
will win the race.  If one of the boats has a 'lightning' pilot, whose 'partner' is a trifle
his inferior, you can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground
or lost some during each four-hour stretch.  The shrewdest pilot can delay a boat if he has
not a fine genius for steering. Steering is a very high art. One must not keep a rudder dragging
across a boat's stem if he wants to get up the river fast.

There is a great difference in boats, of course.  For a long time I was on a boat that was
so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in. But of course this was at rare
intervals.  Ferryboats used to lose valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died,
waiting for us to get by.  This was at still rarer intervals.  I had the documents for these
occurrences, but through carelessness they have been mislaid. This boat, the 'John J. Roe,'
was so slow that when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend, it was five years before the owners
heard of it. That was always a confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record, any
way.  She was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting times racing with islands,
and rafts, and such things. One trip, however, we did rather well.  We went to St. Louis in
sixteen days. But even at this rattling gait I think we changed watches three times in Fort
Adams reach, which is five miles long.  A 'reach' is a piece of straight river, and of course
the current drives through such a place in a pretty lively way.

That trip we went to Grand Gulf, from New Orleans, in four days (three hundred and forty miles);
the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' did it in one. We were nine days out, in the chute of 63 (seven
hundred miles); the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' went there in two days.  Something over a generation
ago, a boat called the 'J. M. White' went from New Orleans to Cairo in three days, six hours,
and forty-four minutes. In 1853 the 'Eclipse' made the same trip in three days, three hours,
and twenty minutes.{footnote [Time disputed. Some authorities add 1 hour and 16 minutes to
this.]}  In 1870 the 'R. E. Lee' did it in three days and ONE hour. This last is called the
fastest trip on record. I will try to show that it was not.  For this reason: the distance
between New Orleans and Cairo, when the 'J. M. White' ran it, was about eleven hundred and
six miles; consequently her average speed was a trifle over fourteen miles per hour. In the
'Eclipse's' day the distance between the two ports had become reduced to one thousand and eighty
miles; consequently her average speed was a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles per
hour. In the 'R. E. Lee's' time the distance had diminished to about one thousand and thirty
miles; consequently her average was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour. Therefore
the 'Eclipse's' was conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been made.

                           MISCELLANEOUS RUNS

In June, 1859, the St. Louis and Keokuk Packet, City of Louisiana, made the run from St. Louis
to Keokuk (214 miles) in 16 hours and 20 minutes, the best time on record.

In 1868 the steamer Hawkeye State, of the Northern Packet Company, made the run from St. Louis
to St. Paul (800 miles) in 2 days and 20 hours. Never was beaten.

In 1853 the steamer Polar Star made the run from St. Louis to St. Joseph, on the Missouri River,
in 64 hours.  In July, 1856, the steamer Jas. H. Lucas, Andy Wineland, Master, made the same
run in 60 hours and 57 minutes.  The distance between the ports is 600 miles, and when the
difficulties of navigating the turbulent Missouri are taken into consideration, the performance
of the Lucas deserves especial mention.

                      THE RUN OF THE ROBERT E. LEE

The time made by the R. E. Lee from New Orleans to St. Louis in 1870, in her famous race with
the Natchez, is the best on record, and, inasmuch as the race created a national interest,
we give below her time table from port to port.

The Lee landed at St. Louis at 11.25 A.M., on July 4th, 1870--6 hours and 36 minutes ahead
of the Natchez.  The officers of the Natchez claimed 7 hours and 1 minute stoppage on account
of fog and repairing machinery. The R. E. Lee was commanded by Captain John W. Cannon, and
the Natchez was in charge of that veteran Southern boatman, Captain Thomas P. Leathers.

Chapter 17 Cut-offs and Stephen

THESE dry details are of importance in one particular. They give me an opportunity of introducing
one of the Mississippi's oddest peculiarities,--that of shortening its length from time to
time. If you will throw a long, pliant apple-paring over your shoulder, it will pretty fairly
shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River; that is, the nine or ten hundred
miles stretching from Cairo, Illinois, southward to New Orleans, the same being wonderfully
crooked, with a brief straight bit here and there at wide intervals.  The two hundred-mile
stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no means so crooked, that being a rocky country
which the river cannot cut much.

The water cuts the alluvial banks of the 'lower' river into deep horseshoe curves; so deep,
indeed, that in some places if you were to get ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and
walk across the neck, half or three quarters of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple
of hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at a speed of ten miles an hour,
to take you aboard again. When the river is rising fast, some scoundrel whose plantation is
back in the country, and therefore of inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little
gutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the water into it, and in a
wonderfully short time a miracle has happened: to wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession
of that little ditch, and placed the countryman's plantation on its bank (quadrupling its value),
and that other party's formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on a big island;
the old watercourse around it will soon shoal up, boats cannot approach within ten miles of
it, and down goes its value to a fourth of its former worth. Watches are kept on those narrow
necks, at needful times, and if a man happens to be caught cutting a ditch across them, the
chances are all against his ever having another opportunity to cut a ditch.
