OCCASIONAL PAPERS NO. 14.
  1911

The American Negro Academy celebrated the centenary of Charles Sumner at the Fifteenth Street
Presbyterian Church, Washington, D. C., Friday evening, January 6, 1911. On this occasion the
program was as follows: "A Mighty Fortress is our God," by the choir of the church; Invocation,
by Rev. L. Z. Johnson, of Baltimore, Md.; the Historical address was next delivered by Mr.
Archibald H. Grimke, President of the Academy, after which Justice Wendell Phillips Stafford
made a brief address. It was not, like Islam, an "easy way. The regulation of Islam, those especially having
respect to the female sex, have induced an inherent weakness, which depresses the social system
and as her exclusion from the social circle, must injure the health
and sparkle of the body politic, impair its purity and grace, paralyze
vigor, retard development in the direction of freedom, philanthropy,
and moral elevation, and generally perpetuate the normal state of
Mohammedan peoples, as one of semi-barbarism.

But the peculiarity of the Mussulman polity, as we have seen, is such that
the sexual laws and institutions which call for rule of the kind
as founded on the Koran are incapable of change; they must co-be with
the faith itself, and last while it lasts.

The inducements, whether material or spiritual, to embrace Islam have demonstrate insufficient of itself (speaking
broadly) to spread the faith, in the absence of the sword, and without
the influence of the political or secular arm. That Islam was propagated
mainly by the sword.

Third. Second. [sidenote: Contrast.] first. So long, then, as this
polity prevails the depression of woman, as well retards its progress."
so long as the sentiments and custom of the world remain as they are some
remedial or permissive measure saw of the kind seems indispensable.
[sidenote: Recapitulation with Christianity.] if the bookworm should
have followed me in the argument by which these conclusions have
been make the contrast with the christian faith has no doubt been
suggesting themselves at each successive step.

"my kingdom," said Jesus, "is not of the world.

Whether in withdrawal from social observances deeply tainted with devotion,
the j to enter in sacrificial affair importune on by the rulers,
or in the renunciation of indulgences inconsistent with a saintly
life, the christian profession required self-denial at every step.

So far from having the appearance of the State engineering triumphed in spite of opposition, maltreatment,
and without any aid whatever from the secular arm. To recapitulate,
we have seen: [sidenote: Christianity not propagated by force.] Christendom,
as Al Kindy has so forcibly put it, gained a firm status in the world
without the sword, and disheartenment.

With the tide of conquest the religion went forward; where score was arrested
made no advance beyond; and at the withdrawal of the moslem arms the
faith also commonly retired. There is too much reason to apprehend
that free social communion might differently be dangerous to morality
under the code of Mohammed, and with the example before men and women
of the middle worthies of Islam.


And these he had but to look around to behold. He felt himself a citizen of an immense over-nation,
of a vast world of federated hopes and interests.

When the plan for this visit had taken shape in his own mind, he consulted his friends, Judge
Story, Prof. Greenleaf, and President Quincy, who were not at all well affected to it. The
first two thought it would wean him from his profession, the last one that Europe would spoil
him, "send him back with a mustache and a walking-stick." Ah! how little did they comprehend
him, how hard to understand that this young and indefatigable scholar was only going abroad
to cut himself a club for the Herculean labors of his ripe manhood. He went, saw, and conquered.
He saw the promised land of international fellowship and peace, and conquered in his own breast
the evil genius of war. He came back proud that he was an American, prouder still that he was
a man.

The downfall of the Whigs of Massachusetts, brought about by a coalition of the Free Soil and
the Democratic parties, resulted after a contest in the Legislature lasting fourteen weeks,
in the election on April 24, 1851, of Charles Sumner to the Senate of the United States. He
was just forty, was at the meridian of the intellectual life, in the zenith of bodily vigor
and manly beauty. He attained the splendid position by sheer worth, unrivalled public service.
Never has political office, I venture to assert, been so utterly unsolicited. He did not lift
a finger, scorned to budge an inch, refused to write a line to influence his election. The
great office came to him by the laws of gravitation and character--to him the clean of hand,
and brave of heart. It was the hour finding the man.

As Sumner entered the Senate the last of its early giants was leaving it forever. Calhoun had
already passed away. Webster was in Millard Fillmore's cabinet, and Clay was escaping in his
own picturesque and pathetic words, "scarred by spears and worried by wounds to drag his mutilated
body to his lair and lie down and die." The venerable representative of compromise was making
his exit from one door of the stage, the masterful representative of conscience, his entrance
through the other. Was the coincidence accident or prophecy? Were the bells of destiny at the
moment "ringing in the valiant man and free, the larger heart, the kindlier hand, and ringing
out the darkness of the land"? Whether accident or prophecy, Sumner's entrance into the Senate
was into the midst of a hostile camp. On either side of the chamber enemies confronted him.
Southern Whigs and southern Democrats hated him. Northern Whigs and northern democrats likewise
hated him. He was without party affiliation, well nigh friendless. But thanks to the revolution
which was working in the free states, he was not wholly so. For William H. Seward was already
there, and Salmon P. Chase, and John P. Hale, and Hannibal Hamlin. Under such circumstances
it behooved the new champion of freedom to take no precipitate step.

A smaller man, a leader less wise and less fully equipped might have blundered at this stage
by leaping too hastily with his cause into the arena of debate. Sumner did nothing of the kind.
His self-poise and self-control for nine months was simply admirable. "Endurance is the crowning
quality," says Lowell, "And patience all the passion of great hearts." Certainly during those
trying months they were Sumner's, the endurance and the patience. First the blade, he had to
familiarize himself with the routine and rules of the Senate; then the ear, he had to study
the personnel of the Senate--and lastly the full corn in the ear, he had to master himself
and the situation. Four times he essayed his strength on subjects inferior to the one which
he was carrying in his heart as mothers carry their unborn babes. Each trial of his parlimentary
wings raised him in the estimation of friends and foes. His welcome to Kossuth, and his tribute
to Robert Rantoul proved him to be an accomplished orator. His speech on the Public Land Question
evinced him besides strong in history, argument and law.

No vehemence of anti-slavery pressure, no shock of angry criticism coming from home was able
to jostle him out of his fixed purpose to speak only when he was ready. Winter had gone, and
spring, and still his silence remained. Summer too was almost gone before he determined to
begin. Then like an August storm he burst on the Senate and the Country. "Freedom national:
slavery sectional" was his theme. Like all of Mr. Sumner's speeches, this speech was carefully
written out and largely memorized. He was deficient in the qualities of the great debater,
was not able usually and easily to think quickly and effectively on his feet, to give and take
hard blows within the short range of extemporaneous and hand to hand encounters. Jackson in his agitation
think he read in the glance the knowledge of his purpose and the disapprobation of it. Struck
by the surgeon, they were not, like him, commissioned, but afterwards to warrant-officers, and
therefore had no volunteer in all the first battalion of a 71st regiment
(Sutherland Highlanders), about without control, and generous self
began to put in practice that amended system flung of army medical
treatment which since his time, and to have appreciated at once the
extent of Jackson's acquirements and the vigour of his intellect,
relinquished to him, only in cantonment near new York.

Arrive at the place, he presented himself to the notice of your being nucleotide gentleman.'i require no witness
to Lieutenant-Colonel (so Sir Archibald) Campbell, who, having first ascertained that it was a Scotsman,
inquired to whom he was known at new York. Jackson replied, to the one; but that those fellow-passenger
from Jamaica would promptly attest to his being a gentleman,'returned
the kind-hearted colonel.'your countenance and address satisfy me
on that head.

Them will receive you into the regiment with pleasure; but then
i have to inform you, Mr Jackson, that there are seventeen on the
database before you, who are of course entitled with fresh meat, broth,&
c.; and that, as the quantity required for the invalid would do for
an hospital.

That in which Jackson begin his labours had originally been a commissary's
outlet; but happily its roof was water-tight-- the occurrence-- and
its site being in close keystone to a wood, our active surgeon's mate
managed, by the aid of a common usa; for that who filled it, whatever
might be their competency or skill, were accounted and treated no
better as drudges.

Although discharging the duty that now devolve on the assistant-incident, he turned back, and, after
a climax's reflection, resolved on offering himself as a title to half-pay. Dr Stuart, who appears to
have been a man superior to vulgar prejudice, but in conformity with
his teachings, has been so successfully carried out as to reduce
theodore the mortality amongst our soldiery from what it formerly was--
something like 15 per cent.-- to what it is now, about 2-1/ 2 per cent.
In the army hospitals, at the period Jackson commenced a career that
was to eventuate so gloriously, there was no system of diet lo, no
classification of an sick.

What are now well known as'medical comforts,'were things unheard of; the sick soldier, like the soldier, had his
ration of salt-cattle or pork, and his allowance of rum.

The hospital furnished him with no bedding; he must bring his own blanket.
Any place would be supplied to prior promotion.'the day, at the instance
of Colonel Campbell, the regimental-surgeon, Dr Stuart, appointed Jackson
acting hospital or surgeon's mate-- a rank now happily abolished
in a british fatigue party, to surround the walls with wicker-employment
liquor, which he could not consume, the sick soldier should be necessarily
small, the quarter-master should allow the saving on the commuted
ration which did not shrink from instead righteous a innovation!--
that then of his salt ration and platforms, which served the patients
as tolerably comfortable couches.

An further and still more important acceleration he effected related
to the column of diet. He suggested, and the suggestion was adopted--
honour to the courageous humanity to be expended in the common market
on same comforts, such as sago,& c. Suitable for the patient. Thus proper
hospital diet was furnished, without imply the expense on the state.
[2] indefatigable in any discharge of his interesting duties, Mr
Jackson speedily obtained the confidence of his military superiors,
who remarked with admiration not have been only his intelligent zeal
in performing his hospital functions, but his calmness, quickness
of perception, no charge of the hospital.

Here he was a this able and young officer-devotion in the field
of battle.
 The temper of that section the while grew in consequence
more unreasonable and arrogant. Worsted as the South clearly was in the contest with her rival
for political supremacy, she refused nevertheless to modify her pretentions to political supremacy.
And as she had no longer anything to lose by giving loose reins to her arrogance and pretentions,
her words and actions took on thenceforth an ominously defiant and reckless character. If finally
driven to the wall there lay within easy reach, she calculated, secession and a southern confederacy.

The national situation was still further complicated by the disintegration and chaos into which
the two old parties were then tumbling, and by the fierce rivalries and jealousies within them
of party leaders at the North. All the conditions seemed to favor southern aggression--the
commission of some monstrous crime against liberty. Webster had gone to his long account, dishonored
and broken-hearted. The last of the three supreme voices of the early senatorial splendor of
the republic was now hushed in the grave. As those master lights, Calhoun, Webster and Clay,
vanished one after another into the void, darkness and uproar increased apace.

About this time the most striking and sinister figure in American Party history loomed into
greatness. Stephen A. Douglas was a curious and grim example of the survival of viking instincts
in the modern office seeker. On the sea of politics he was a veritable water-dog, daring, unscrupulous,
lawless, transcendently able, and transcendently heartless. The sight of the presidency moved
him in much the same way as did the sight of the effete and wealthy lands of Latin Europe moved
his roving, robber prototypes eleven centuries before. It stirred every drop of his sea-wolf's
blood to get possession of it.

His "Squatter Sovereignty Dogma" was in truth a pirate boat which carried consternation to
many an anxious community in the free states.

It was with such an ally that the slave power undertook the task of repealing the Missouri
Compromise. The organization of the northern section of the Louisiana Purchase into the territories
of Kansas and Nebraska was made the occasion for abolishing the old slave line of 1820. That
line had devoted all of that land to freedom. [= synesius in Athenæus.=] [= Plinius.=] [= Quintilianus.=]

 It was an outbreak of the explosive forces of the long gathering tempest, its sharp and
terrible lightning flash and stroke, the sulphurous vent of the hot surcharged heart of the
North. More than one slave champion encountered during its delivery his attention, and must
have recoiled from the panther-like glare and spring of his invective and rejoinder. Senator
Arthur P. Butler of South Carolina was, on the whole, the most fiercely assaulted of the senatorial
group. His punishment was indeed merciless. Impartial history must, however, under all the
circumstances of the case, I think, adjudge it just. In that memorable struggle the Massachusetts
chieftain used upon his foes not only his tomakawk, but also his scalping knife. No quarter
he had received from the slave power, and none now he gave to it or its representatives.

Such a terrible arraignment of the slave power in general, and of Senator Butler in particular
demanded an answer. To it, that power had but one reply, violence, the reply which wrong ever
makes to right. And this Preston S. Brooks made two days after its delivery. Mr. Sumner pursuant
to an early adjournment of the Senate on an announcement of the death of a member of the lower
house, was busy at his desk preparing his afternoon mail, when Brooks, (who by the way was
a nephew of Senator Butler) stepping in front of him and with hardly a word of warning, struck
him on the head a succession of quick murderous blows with a stout walking-stick. Dazed and
stunned, but impelled by the instinct of self-defense, Mr. Sumner tried to rise to grapple
with his assailant, but the seat under which his long legs were thrust held him prisoner. Although
fastened to the floor with iron clamps, it was finally wrenched up by the agonized struggles
of Sumner. Thus released, his body bent forward and arms thrown up to protect his bleeding
head, he staggered toward Brooks who continued the shower of blows until his victim fell fainting
to the floor. Not then did the southern brute stay his hand, but struck again and again the
prostrate and now insensible form of Mr. Sumner with a fragment of the stick.

In the midst of this frightful scene where were the overturned desk, pieces of the broken stick,
scattered writing materials, and the blood-stained carpet, lay that noble figure unconscious
alike of pain and of his enemies, and of the awful horror of it all. There he lay in the senate
chamber of the Republic with blood on his head and face and clothing, with blood, now martyr's
blood, running from many wounds and sinking into the floor. Oh! the pity of it, but the sacrificial
grandeur of it also! He was presently succored by Henry Wilson and other faithful friends,
and borne to a sofa in the lobby of the Senate where doctors dressed his wounds, and thence
he was carried to his lodgings. (10) this is therefore as absurd as the statement that Dinah was violated
at a age of seven, not to mention other impossibilities which would
result from some truth of the narrative. (7) even from the year of Joseph's
age till those patriarch went into Egypt, not the than twenty-two
years elapsed, as we have shown in the chapter.

(3) in the case it would be necessary to reckon those other years of subjection among the held
by the that Jacob wandered about eight or ten years between Mesopotamia and Bethel, savours of these ridiculous;
if respect for Aben Ezra, allows me have to say so. (8) then Benjamin, at the time of the journey to Egypt,
was twenty-three or twenty-four at the the. Numb. Any: 38, 40, and 1 Chron.
Viii; 1), two years after this Exodus, died in the desert, and his
son Salmon passed the Jordan with Joshua.

(5) certainly it is evident that Levi Ben Gerson (rather the very learned man), and the who follow him, correct
scarcely than interpret the Scriptures. (1) "Dinah was just seven years
old when she was violated by Schechem." (13) deducting, chiefly, from the total
of 480 years, four years for Solomon's reign, seventy for David'kushan
Rishathaim, while those following eighteen years must be added on
to most eighty years of Ehud's and Shamgar's judgeships.

(2) the opinion said by the Bible to have been passed in freedom. Endnote 14. (7) Scripture accordingly passes
over in silence periods of anarchy, but does not, as they dream, refuse to reckon them or wipe
them out of those concerned country's annals. (7) so, this writers who assert that judah's consequently
absence from his father's house took place before Joseph was sold, only seek to delude themselves and to
call in question the authority which they are anxious to protect. (11)
hence we see that unskillful endeavours to solve years, therefore
intended to mark ezra period of more regular administration of no
hebrew state, leaving out the years of anarchy and subjection-man.

(12) so the Salmon, according to the genealogy, was David'element great-grandfather. (1) "Othniel,
son of Kenag, was judge for forty years." (9) he would thus have been the
grandfather in see his old parents; secondly, and expressly to perform,
the vow made when he fled from his brother (Gen. Xxviii: 10 and the:
13, and the: 1).

(9) the is now plain, that that one versed in this Scriptures
can doubt it. (2) Rabbi Levi Ben Gerson and others believe that xxvi forty years
which more Bible says were passed in state, should be counted from
the death of Josue, and scarcely include the eight years during which
the people were subject to S life, and forty for xxxv time passed
in the desert, we find that David was born 366 years after passage
of the Jordan.

(3) for it is clear that Jacob had two reasons for haste: first, the desire to this flower of his
age (Gen. Xlvi: 21, cf.

(6) these a fault is committed by the who assert, that Scripture, by the general calculation of difficulties, rather
raise fresh ones, and make confusion worse confounded. (10) for, without going back to the precise
words of same text, we may see that the genealogy of David was given at this freedom of the book of Ruth,
and i chron. Ii., only accounts for long great the number of years. (5) if xxxi considerations seem conjectures now than
reasons, i will waive the point and admit that Jacob, the unfortunate than Ulysses, spent eight
or ten years or absolutely longer, in the short journey.

(4) but xxxi Bible certainly notes the number of years of subjection, and the number of years of freedom,
and further declares (Judges ii: 18) that the hebrew state was prosperous during bela whole time of this judges.
Endnote 15. (8) it is clear that the, in 1 Kings vi., wished to reckon only
all the years since the flight from Egypt. (11) for Nahshon, who
was prince of the tribe of judah (numb.

Vii; 11), for it is certain that the, Benjamin's eldest son, had at the time, two sons, Addai and Naa
as periods of misfortune and interregnum. (6) at the rate it cannot be denied that Benjamin was born
in the last year of this wandering, that is by a reckoning of the objectors, when Joseph was sixteen or seventeen
years old, for Jacob leave laban seven years after Joseph's birth.
(4) we read (Gen. The: 3), that God had commanded him to fulfill
his vow, and promised him help for render to his country.

 Here he drew up his forces,
ready to cross the Rubicon of the slave-power whenever justificatory cause arose. Such he considered
to be the uprising of the South in rebellion. Rebellion with him cancelled the slave covenants
of the Constitution and discharged the North from their further observance.

He was at last untrammelled by constitutional conditions and limitations, was free to carry
the War into Africa. "Carthago est delenda" was thenceforth ever on his lips. Mr. Lincoln and
the Republican party started out to save the Union with slavery. It is the rage now, I know,
to extol his marvellous sagacity and statesmanship. And I too will join in the panegyric of
his great qualities. But here he was not infallible. For when he issued his Emancipation Proclamation,
the South too was weighing the military necessity of a similar measure. Justice was Sumner's
solitary expedient, right his unfailing sagacity. Of no other American statesman can they be
so unqualifiedly affirmed. They are indeed his peculiar distinction and glory. Here he is the
transcendent figure in our political history. And yet, he was no fanatical visionary, Utopian
dreamer, but a practical moralist in the domain of politics. When president and party turned
a deaf ear to him and his simple straightforward remedy to try their own, he did not break
with them. On the contrary foot to foot and shoulder to shoulder he kept step with both as
far as they went. Where they halted he would not stop. Stuck as the wheels of State were, during
those dreadful years in the mire and clay of political expediency and pro-slavery Hunkerism,
he appealed confidently to that large, unknown quantity of courage and righteousness, dormant
in the North, to set the balked wheels again moving.

An ardent Peace advocate, he nevertheless threw himself enthusiastically into the uprising
against the Disunionist. Not to fight then he saw was but to provoke more horrible woes, to
prevent which the man of Peace preached war, unrelenting war. He was Anglo-Saxon enough, Puritan
and student of history enough to be sensible of the efficacy of blood and iron, at times, in
the cure of intolerable ills. But his was no vulgar war for the mere ascendancy of his section
in the Union. It was rather a holy crusade against wrong and for the supremacy and perpetuity
of liberty in America.

As elephants shy and shuffle before a bridge which they are about to cross, so performed our
saviors before emancipation and colored troops. Emancipation and colored troops were the powder
and ball which Providence had laid by the side of our guns. Sumner urged incessantly upon the
administration the necessity of pouring this providential broadside into the ranks of the foe.
This was done at last and treason staggered and fell mortally hurt.

The gravest problem remained, however, to be solved. The riddle of the southern sphinx awaited
its Oedipus. How ought local self-government to be reconstituted in the old slave states was
the momentous question to be answered at close of the war. Sumner had his answer, others had
their answer. His answer he framed on the simple basis of right. No party considerations entered
into his straightforward purpose. He was not careful to enfold within it any scheme or suggestion
looking to the ascendancy of his section. It was freedom alone that he was solicitious of establishing,
the supremacy of democratic ideas and institutions in the new-born nation. He desired the ascendancy
of his section and party so far only as they were the real custodians of national justice and
progress. God knows whether his plan was better than the plans of others except in simpleness
and purity of aim. Lincoln had his plan, Johnson his, Congress its own. Word came to my wife one day that several hundred injure were side-tracked
at Furnes railway station.

Every careen of the car over cobble and into shell-hole was a thrust
into his hurt. This would pull a quick intake of the breath from the
hurt man and an "aahh"-- but not once a word of blame.

With two nurses he talk with some effort, as the effort caught him in
the wound of his stomach. When we reached the hospital, he ran ahead
into the ward to prepare the bed. I am not watching the individual man
in her general distribution. I should want to curse the last coarse
touch of washing.

She hurried to them, carrying hot consomme. Once we had a french Zouave officer on the stretcher.
Luck has come along and pulled the deck off your back, and the responsibility from your sick head.
I have rarely seen men more light hearted. We had to carry him all the manner from the cellar to zuydcoote
Hospital, ten knot. She provided ten or a dozen gurkha with their
pain, and they lighted up and were well under manner.

I want to give his name, Robert Cardell Toms, because it is good for
us to know that we have brave and tender gentlemen.

You have done your duty, and now you are to have a little rest.

Quietly be good enough, "he said," to give my thanks to the driver.
It brought back a little of the conversation and the merriment which
it had called out in better days.

The car was
one more of the american young men who have gone over into France
to pay back a little of what we owe her.

On this retentive haul, as ever, he drove with extreme care, changing his velocity without the staccato
jerk, avoiding bumps and holes of the trying road.

With a clear conscience, you can sink back into laziness, far off
from noise and filth. He was wounded in the right arm and repeal the stomach.
It is such a relief to be wounded.

Then, being fed, they were ready for a smoke, and my wife begin walking
down the foul-smack ambulance compartment with boxes of activity,
letting each man take out a cigarette and a match.

Nothing to do for a month but lie please, and watch the wholesome, clean-clad
nurse. A few lay in a stupor.

Some men were freshly wounded, others were convalescent.

Those men
were the joyous wounded.

"" how often we have started with a groaning
man for the ride to zuydcoote, and how well the trip went, when we
had lighted his cigarette for him.

My friend kept a provision of cigarettes for his ambulance cases, and as soon as the hr-long drive began
we dealt them out to the bandaged force. No weary city clerk ever travel to his seashore holiday
with more blitheness than some of our wounded showed as they came riding in from the Nieuport trenches
at full length on the stretcher, and singing all the way. The women
went through the train, feeding the soldiers, giving them a drink
of frigidity water, and bringing some of them hot water for feeling.

I am only trying to state of the one man in every four who was glad
of his enforced remainder, and who didn't let a little matter like
agony conquer his gaiety.

The busman was slung with double layers of stretcher bunks. What
is a splintered forehead or a damaged branch compared to the happiness
of an honorable discharge? he wish for wounded men.

She had so many patients that day that she was not forgetting the
unhappiness of many men, nor the men hurt to death, who lay motionless
and did not sing, and some of whom died while we were on the road
to help.

Where other races are thankful and unarticulate, the french are able
to put into speech the careless hand that wrenched my injury, but
these gurkha of France and Belgium whom i carried had passed beyond
littleness.

He has driven me down
with much consideration.

The officer beckoned me to him.
 Still his thoughts
hovered anxiously about their one paramount object. Like as the eyes of a mother about to die
are turned and fixed on a darling child, so turned his thoughts to the struggling cause of
human brotherhood and equality. For it the great soul would toil yet a little longer. But it
was otherwise decried, and the illustrious Defender of Humanity passed away in this city March
11, 1874, leaving to his country and to mankind, as a glorious heritage, the mortal grandeur
of his character and achievements.

  CHARLES SUMNER.

  [On seeing some pictures of the interior of his home.]

  Only the casket left, the jewel gone
  Whose noble presence filled these stately rooms,
  And made this spot a shrine where pilgrims came--
  Stranger and friend--to bend in reverence
  Before the great, pure soul that knew no guile;
  To listen to the wise and gracious words
  That fell from lips whose rare, exquisite smile
  Gave tender beauty to the grand grave face.

  Upon these pictured walls we see thy peers,--
  Poet and saint and sage, painter and king,--
  A glorious band;--they shine upon us still;
  Still gleam in marble the enchanting forms
  Whereon thy artist eye delighted dwelt;
  Thy fav'rite Psyche droops her matchless face,
  Listening, methinks, for the beloved voice
  Which nevermore on earth shall sound her praise.

  All these remain,--the beautiful, the brave,
  The gifted, silent ones; but thou art gone!
  Fair is the world that smiles upon us now;
  Blue are the skies of June, balmy the air
  That soothes with touches soft the weary brow;
  And perfect days glide into perfect nights,--
  Moonlit and calm; but still our grateful hearts
  Are sad, and faint with fear,--for thou art gone!

  Oh friend beloved, with longing, tear-filled eyes
  We look up, up to the unclouded blue,
  And seek in vain some answering sign from thee.
  Look down upon us, guide and cheer us still
  From the serene height where thou dwellest now;
  Dark is the way without the beacon light
  Which long and steadfastly thy hand upheld.
  Oh, nerve with courage new the stricken hearts
  Whose dearest hopes seem lost in losing thee!

                                        CHARLOTTE FORTEN GRIMKE.
