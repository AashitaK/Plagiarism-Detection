A SKETCH OF THE FOLK-LORE OF BORNEO.

In this short monograph I do not pretend to give anything more than a Sketch of the Folk-lore
to be found among the Borneans. The island is large, and the people, scattered and isolated
by constant inter-tribal warfare, differ one tribe from another, in language, customs and appearance
almost more than do Germans, French, or English; to say that any tradition or custom is common
to all the tribes, or even to all of one tribe, of Borneans, would be far too sweeping. A still
greater drawback to any universality, in legend or custom, is that there is no written language,
not even so much as picture-drawings on rocks to give us a clue to ancient myths or traditions.
The natives of Borneo are in a certain sense savages, but yet they are savages of a high order,
possessed of a civilization far above what is usually implied by the term; they live together
in what almost might be called coöperative communities, they practise the art of weaving, they
forge rough implements of iron, they cultivate rice and esculent plants, and in all their work,
such as house-building, boat-building, manufacture of cloth and weapons of warfare, they show
an ambitious desire, and a skilful ability, to ornament their work and add, to its usefulness,
pleasure to the eye. One of their gravest faults, however, is their embarrassing tenacity to
the fad of head-hunting, and a strict adherence to the principle of an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth. This keeps the different households, even of the same tribe, at constant
war and makes inevitable an uncomfortable yet pleasing interchange of heads during the tedious
months of the rainy season, when time hangs heavy on the warriors' hands, and disused swords
might get rusty.

So little is known of the social and anthropological position of these people, to others than
those who make Malaysia and the South Sea islands their study, that it may not be out of place
to give a short description of the people themselves before entering on the subject of their
Folk-lore.

The remote origin of the Borneans, as well as of the greater part of all of the inhabitants
of the Polynesian islands, is an ethnological problem; they are not Malay, neither are they
Mongolian nor Negrito; they bear resemblances here and there to all of these races, but not
marked enough to claim any one as the parent stock. Furthermore, there is some evidence in
favor of the theory that they are the result of successive migrations of tribes from northern
India and from Anam.

The inland tribes of Borneo, by which I include all the natives except the Malays settled along
the coast, are without any definite forms of religious worship; they make idols of wood, but
I have never seen any offering made to them, nor do they regard them apparently as anything
more than as scarecrows to frighten off evil spirits. They are the children of Dame Nature
and as such have inherited their mother's disregard for life, and this feature of their temperament
has kept them in a constant turmoil of warfare, which in turn compels them for mutual protection
to band together in communities of several families and build for themselves a common house
wherein to live, ever ready to turn out in force and resist the attacks of hostile tribes.
In not a few instances these houses are as much as a quarter of a mile in length and shelter
as many as four hundred people. Every household is presided over by a head-man known as the
elder, or Orang Tuah, and he in turn is governed in a measure by the chief of the tribe, known
as the Penghulu. The government of the household seems to be conducted in the quietest manner;
I have lived on several occasions in these houses for three or four weeks at a time, and have
never seen anything that could be called a violent quarrel between two members of the household,
nor have I seen the Orang Tuah or the Penghulu submit any of the members to what might be considered
harsh treatment. I have also been with them when they were out on the warpath, to use a North-American
Indian term, when every nerve was at high tension on the look-out for enemies and every thought
was turned to slaughter, but I have never seen the counsel of the Chief disregarded. Of course,
some Chiefs are weak and fail to give commands because they are afraid to act, but a command
once given is carried out, or at least not disregarded, and I could never detect any means
which were taken to enforce an authority thus implicitly obeyed.

As a people, they are not active-minded nor industrious, but yield to the influence of climate,
and, following the example offered to them by the vast, dense jungle on every side, accept
life as easily as it comes. They are no exception to the rule that all untutored minds, living
in constant communion with any awful aspect of Nature, be it gigantic mountains, a waste of
waters, or an illimitable jungle, are saturated with superstitions; every pool, every tree,
every rock is the home of an evil spirit, and all mysterious noises in the forest are ghostly
whisperings. Everywhere are signs and omens to warn man of danger or direct his course; theirs
is a life where no schooling is so vital as the ability to read aright the "sermons in stones,
books in the running brooks." For them the world is the patch of jungle covering the few square
miles that they know, and bounded by the hills in the distance; seldom do they get an extended
view of the surrounding country; trees hem them in on all sides and the mountains are so difficult
of ascent, and furthermore so infested with demons or "antu," that the summits can be gained
only at the risk of body, and, still worse, of soul.

Many natives of the interior live and die with never a glimpse of the sea, and the tales which
the Malay and Chinese traders tell of lands beyond the horizon where white men live, are as
incomprehensible to them as are to us the conjectural accounts which astronomers give of the
canals on the planet Mars.

Naturally enough, of course, creation began on the island of Borneo, or Kalamantan, as they
call it, and the first people were Borneans and spoke the language of the tribe that tells
the story. Every tribe has a different account of creation, and claims that its people sprang
from the first created mortals. The following account is the story of Genesis according to
the Kayans of Northwestern Borneo:--

In the old, old days, when there was nothing but water and sky, there fell from the heavens
an enormous rock; that part of it which protruded from the water was hard, slippery, and quite
bare, with no soil nor plants upon it of any kind. After a long time, however, the rains produced
slime upon the rock, and little worms, called halang, were bred in this slime, and they bored
into the rock and left fine sand outside of their burrows; this sand eventually became soil
and covered the rock. Again years passed and the rock remained barren of all other life until
suddenly there dropped from the Sun a huge wooden handle of a Parang (or sword) known as Haup
Malat. This parang-handle sank deep into the rock and taking root in the soil it sprouted and
grew into a great tree, named Batang Utar Tatei, whose branches stretched out over the new
land in every direction. When this tree was fully grown, there dropped from the Moon a long
rope-like vine known as the Jikwan Tali. This vine quickly clung to the tree and took root
in the rock. Now the vine, Jikwan Tali, from the Moon became the husband of the tree, Batang
Utar Tatei, from the Sun, and Batang Utar Tatei gave birth to twins, a male and a female, not
of the nature of a tree, but more or less like human beings. The male child was called Klobeh
Angei, and the female was called Klubangei. These two children married and then gave birth
to two more children, who were named Pengok N'gai, and Katirah Murai. Katirah Murai was married
to old man Ajai Avai, who comes without pedigree into the narration. From Katirah Murai and
Ajai Avai are descended many of the chiefs who were founders of the various tribes inhabiting
the land of Kalamantan; their names are Sejau Laho, Oding Lahang, from whom the Kayans spring,
Tabalan, Pliban, and, finally, Tokong, the father of head-hunting.

As time went on, that which formerly had been merely slime on the rock, became moss, and little
by little small plants were produced. The twigs and leaf-like appendages of the tree, evidently
the female principle in nature, as they fell to the ground, became birds, beasts, and fishes.
(Let me mention here that the endowment of leaves with life and locomotion is no more than
natural; while in the jungle I have repeatedly seen what, in every respect, appeared to be
a leaf fall to the ground and then miraculously put out legs and walk away; it was one of those
remarkable insects of the Mantis family, or "walking leaves.") The inhabitants of the rock
had no need of fire in those days, for the sun beat down on them strongly, and there was no
night; it was not until many, many years had elapsed that an old man named Laki Oi invented
a method of obtaining fire by means of friction produced by pulling a strip of rattan rapidly
back and forth beneath a piece of dry wood. This process of making fire he called Musa, and
it is still the only method used in obtaining fire for ceremonials, such as the naming of a
child, or when communicating with the omen-birds. Laki Oi also taught them the use of the fire-drill,
which he called the Nalika.

On the main trunk of Batang Utar Tatei was a large excrescence, from which exuded a resinous
gum called Lutong, which, as it dropped to the ground beneath, was immediately transformed
into chickens and swine; and it is because they were thus formed out of the very heart and
substance of the tree that they are always used in the reading of auguries. From this same
cause, there was innate in them an insight into the innermost workings of Nature and a knowledge
of the future.

The first beings with any resemblance to man had neither legs, nor breasts, and consisted merely
of a head, chest, arms, and a fragment of a body which hung down in shreds and rags, having
the appearance of twisted snakes. When they moved they dragged themselves along the ground
by their arms. (From this description and from native carvings, I am inclined to believe that
a large cuttle-fish or octopus must have suggested this idea to the original narrator of this
tradition.) Little by little, the body was brought into more compact form, and, in a later
generation, legs appeared, but it was a long time before they became accustomed to legs and
able to use them in moving about. A survival of this awkwardness, so say the Kayans, is still
noticeable in the way in which children crawl about the floor, and in their clumsy walk when
first they learn to stand upright. The heads of these first people were, furthermore, much
larger than the heads of the present generation, and, since it was the first part formed, it
is the oldest part of the body, and on this account the most important member, and valued accordingly
whether dead or alive.

This account is, as far as I know, purely Bornean, inasmuch as had there been any admixture
from a foreign source (as we shall see further on was probably the case with the Dyaks) there
would have been possibly some reference to a Supreme Creator rather than to this union of a
vine and a tree as the original source of life. The Kayans from whom I obtained this account
have had exceedingly little communication with the outside world, except through occasional
Malay or Chinese traders. There is just a possibility that the idea of the wooden sword-handle
being the ultimate fons et origo of all life comes from the fact that the word for chief--"penghulu"--is
derived from "hulu," meaning a sword-handle, and the prefix "peng" denoting agency, so that
the whole word means literally "the master of the sword," and thus the ruler or chief. From
association of ideas, the sword-handle, without which the blade is ineffective and useless,
may have been suggested to them as the chief of all beings. The sudden appearance of Ajai Avai
on the scene as the husband of Katirah Murai, is not at all at variance with the accounts from
many other sources of the populating of the world. In Laki Oi, we recognize the Kayan "Prometheus,"
whose memory is revered by sanctifying the fire procured after his manner of teaching, and
from this tradition it is probable that the procuring of fire by means of the "fire-saw" is
the aboriginal method. Should all of the fires in a Kayan house become extinguished and no
spark be left, new fires may be started by this method, and by this method alone; even the
fire-drill, and flint and steel, which are not unknown to them, are tabooed.

The Dayaks, who are closely akin in every respect to the Malays, and no doubt adopted the traditions
which were rife among the Malays both before and after the latter became converted to Mohammedanism,
give an account of the creation of the world differing in every particular from the foregoing
Kayan story.

One of the Dayak versions of the creation which I heard from the people of that tribe, living
in the Baram district of Sarawak, is that in the beginning there were two large birds,--the
Burong Iri and the Burong Ringgong (Burong meaning bird), who made all the rivers, the great
sea, the earth, and the sky. The first things to have life were plants and trees. When trees
were first made, the winds blew them down, and again and again the Iri and the Ringgong had
to set them up, until in their great wisdom they realized the necessity of props and stays,
so they fashioned the strong vines and creepers. Then these two creators saw what pleasant
places the boughs and branches of these trees would make for other beings; whereupon they created
birds and all flying animals, like bats and flying squirrels. Then for a long while they consulted
together, and, finally, decided that they would make a man who should walk about on the earth;
at first, they made him of clay, but when he was dried he could neither speak nor move, which
provoked them, and they ran at him angrily; so frightened was he that he fell backward and
broke all to pieces. The next man that they made was of hard wood, but he, also, was utterly
stupid, and absolutely good for nothing. Then the two birds searched carefully for a good material,
and eventually selected the wood of a tree known as the Kumpong, which has a strong fibre and
exudes a quantity of deep red sap, whenever it is cut. Out of this tree they fashioned a man
and a woman, and were so well pleased with this achievement that they rested for a long while
and admired their handiwork. Then they decided to continue creating more men; they returned
to the Kumpong tree, but they had entirely forgotten their original pattern, and how they had
executed it, and they were therefore able to make only very inferior creatures, which became
the ancestors of the Maias (the Orang Utan) and monkeys.

The man and the woman were very helpless and hardly knew how to obtain the simplest necessities
of life, so the Iri and the Ringgong devised the Ubi--a wild sweetpotato--the wild Tapioca,
the Kaladi, or, as we know it, the Kaladium, and other edible roots, whereof the man and woman
soon learned to eat; fire, however, was unknown to these first people and they had to eat all
of their food raw.

Contemporaneously with the Maias and the monkeys many other animals came into being, among
them the dog. For a long time all living things were friendly to one another and lived in the
land of Kaburau, which lies near a branch of the great Kapuas river, and is, even to this day,
considered by the Dayaks as the garden-spot of the world. The dog, however, because he cleaned
himself with his tongue, soon came to be despised by all other animals, and although a bully
he was yet subservient to man. Then the deer and many of the other animals taunted the dog,
saying that he was so mean-spirited and servile that although man thrashed him, nevertheless
he fawned upon him and followed after him; which they would never do, so they went off to the
jungle to live. But the dog comforted himself by saying that "When the man is about to strike
me I crouch down and sometimes this keeps his hand off; furthermore, I cannot live on the poor
food that these others must eat." Hence, the dog follows and obeys man.

One day when the man and the dog were in the jungle together, and got drenched by rain, the
man noticed that the dog warmed himself by rubbing against a huge creeper, called the Aka Rarah,
whereupon the man took a stick and rubbed it rapidly against the Aka Rarah, and to his surprise
obtained fire. This was the origin of the Sukan, or fire drill, and ever after the man had
fire in his house. Not long after, in accidentally dropping an Ubi near the fire, he found
that it became much more pleasant to the taste; by this accident cooking was discovered.

In the course of time, the dog and other animals began to multiply, and man imitated their
example; the woman brought forth a male child, whose name was Machan Buntu. After many years,
the woman gave birth to a female child who, when she was well grown, married her brother Machan
Buntu and gave birth to seventy children at one time. These children left their home and scattered
all over the world. Some became wood sprites and mountain gnomes, living in the trees, in the
rivers, and under ground.

The tradition of the manufacture of man out of wood instead of clay is thoroughly in keeping
with an origin purely Dayak. The Dayaks never have been proficient in pottery, and to this
day they carve their bowls and dishes out of hard wood, otherwise it seems to me that clay
would have suggested itself to them as the most suitable substance whereof to have made man.
Another item looks as if part of the story were an interpolation, namely, where it is related
that the two birds were so pleased with their work after making man, that they rested; this
looks like a suggestion due to the first chapter of Genesis. Again, in that land of Kaburau,
where all animals lived in perfect harmony, and which was the garden of the world, we may recognize
the garden of Eden. Owing to the lack of writing, as I said before, it is impossible to say
how old this tradition is, or to what extent it is known to Dayaks in other parts of the country;
I have heard that very much the same story is told by the natives in the Rejang district several
hundred miles south of the Baram; where the chiefest difference in the accounts is that earlier
and higher than the birds there was a Supreme Being called Rajah Gantalla, who after creating
the two birds, committed the rest of the work to them. I think in the -allah of this name (I
speak under correction) we may discern a strong indication of Mohammedan influence. The first
man, instead of being carved entirely of Kumpong wood, was made, in this latter account, of
clay and then filled with the sap of the Kumpong tree.

A tradition (I do not say "legend," for this implies writing) which all the Kayans seem to
know and to take pleasure in relating, is connected with the origin of their rite of head-hunting,
for, although every possible means is employed by the European rulers of the island to stop
this custom, it is still, nevertheless the one ruling passion of the people. Nay, it is part
of their Religion; no house is blest which is not sanctified by a row of human skulls, and
no man can hope to attain to the happy region of Apo Leggan unless he, or some near relative
of his, has added a head to the household collection. Let me correct, however, with regard
to head-hunting, what is probably the prevalent idea that the heads are hung up in the houses
bleeding and raw, just as they are severed from the body. This is quite wrong; whether or not
they would tolerate in their homes such horrid objects I cannot say, but certain it is that
the heads are first subjected to fire and smoke until the flesh has dropped away, and what
is then hung up is merely a skull; unpleasant enough, but not so bad as is generally supposed.

The tradition is that the great chief Tokong, when out on a war expedition, was told by Kop,
the frog, that he should always take, instead of only the hair, the whole head of his enemies;
Tokong was angry, at first, at the frog, but his followers at length persuaded him to let them
try the experiment on their next attack. After taking the whole heads, the war party retreated
quickly to the river down which they had come, and came to the spot where they had left their
boats and were surprised to find that everything was exactly as they had left it. When they
embarked, lo, and behold! the current of the stream was, for their sakes, reversed and like
a flash they were carried up-stream and reached their home in a miraculously short time. During
the fifteen days that they had been absent the crop of rice had not only sprouted, but had
grown, had ripened, and was almost ready to be harvested; the members of their family who had
been sick when they left, were now all well, the lame could walk and the blind see. The wise
men waggled their heads, and one and all declared (and who can blame them?) that ever after
they would stick to the custom that Kop had taught them.

It is not unfair to infer from this tradition that they have a crude, germinal sense of the
barbarity of their actions, in so far as they think it necessary to invent an excuse to palliate
that savage love of trophy-hunting which seems inborn in mankind. The rite of head-hunting
is by no means confined to Borneo; the Formosans, and also many of our new fellow-citizens,
among the tribes of the Philippines, are enthusiastic head-hunters, and our own cherished Indians
within our own borders have not yet given up their love for a scalp; it would be perilous to
assert that it is not a United States custom.

The idea that the taking of a head is necessary in order to obtain entrance to the pleasant
regions of the land of departed spirits, is a doctrine taught by the chiefs in order to make
men brave in battle, and do all in their power to avoid the punishment which awaits the coward.
The Kayan Hades is believed to be under ground, and like the Hades of the ancient Greeks there
is a guide to the entrance who corresponds to a certain extent to Charon. But their river Styx
is not a stream, but a deep and wide ditch, through which flow ooze and slime swarming with
worms and maggots; the souls of the departed must cross over this ditch not by a ferry, but
by means of a fallen tree-trunk, guarded by the great demon Maligang, who challenges all comers,
and if they have no record of bravery, he shakes the tree-trunk until they fall into the ditch
below and are eternally tortured by the devouring worm that dieth not. Over the land of spirits
presides the great demon Laki Tenangan, who assigns the souls to their proper place, and sees
that they get their deserts, whether good or bad.

In this shadowy world, APO LEGGAN is one of the principal regions, and is the abode of the
spirits of those who die from sickness or from old age. The souls in Apo Leggan have much the
same lot as they had in this world; the poor remain poor, and the rich maintain their rich
estate, and even the soul that has been harassed in life in the upper air must none the less
expect to find misfortune and perplexity in the world to come. In the absence of any definite
code of morals, this is, perhaps, the most suitable belief that a savage tribe could have;
it stimulates them to a constant endeavor to better their condition in this life and make their
mark in some way, so that the life to come, in which they have a firm belief, may not be a
continuation of the hardships they have endured here. Their methods of gaining wealth may not
conform to our ideas of propriety, but then all is fair in love and war, and as they have very
little idea of love, their motto has to be "all is fair in war;" life in the jungle is little
else than a ceaseless struggle for the survival of the fittest.

LONG JULAN, a second division, is where live the souls of those who have died a violent or
sudden death, either on the battlefield, or in their own clearings by the accidental fall of
a tree; and there also dwell the young mothers who have died in childbirth; they become the
wives of young warriors who likewise have been cut off in the bloom of youth and are therefore
proper mates for unfortunate little mothers. Such beliefs naturally tend to the taking of life;
a young man, for instance, who loses his wife in childbirth wishes to meet her again in the
next world, and his ambition to go on the warpath is doubly strong. Is he fortunate enough
to take a head, he gains high rank among warriors; should he be killed, he has the comfortable
assurance that he will again meet his wife in Long Julan. The souls in Long Julan have an easy
time and are always fairly well off, whatever their circumstances were in this life.

TAN TEKKAN, a third division, is the place to which Laki Tenangan consigns suicides; wretched
and woe begone in appearance, their souls wander about in the jungle and in the clearings trying
to pick up a living by eating what roots and fruits they can find. This joyless Hereafter is
calculated to make those who contemplate suicide, rather perform some self-sacrificing act
of bravery whereby they will not only benefit those whom they leave behind, but also gain for
themselves a more pleasant position in the world to come; therefore suicide is not at all common.

TENYU LALU, a fourth region, is assigned to the spirits of still-born children. These little
souls are said to be exceedingly brave and need no other weapon wherewith to defend themselves
than a stick of wood; they have never felt pain nor experienced danger in this world, and are
therefore totally ignorant of such emotions. Whether or not they increase in size in Tenyu
Lalu is not known, but it is generally supposed that they live together in a little world of
their own.

Finally, LING YANG is the abode of those who have died by drowning; it lies below the beds
of rivers, and here the spirits soon become exceedingly rich. All the goods lost in rivers
by the capsizing of boats in the rapids, or when they run foul of a snag in deep water, go
into the coffers of the dwellers in Ling Yang.

Such are the main divisions of the Dali Matei, or country of the dead; there are, however,
many sacred hills, rivers, and lakes wherein dwell certain powerful demons who govern the spirits.
In this nether world, some say that there are trees and plants and animals much the same as
in this; this point, however, seemed open to considerable doubt in the minds of some whom I
questioned, while others had so definite an idea of it that they drew maps to show the positions
of the different regions. They seemed to regard it as a large river, along whose tributaries
dwelt the various classes of departed spirits. The Dayongs, or medicine men, are the only ones
who are supposed really to know; these all maintain that, while acquiring their power over
sickness, they had visited the land of spirits. In the mythology of all countries there is
sure to be a hero who has made the descent to Hades and returned to tell the tale, and the
Kayans are no exceptions; they have their Orpheus, only his name is Gamong.

Gamong, during an attack of fever, realized that he was at the point of death, but was loath
to resign his spirit, so he called his friends around him and begged them to dress him up,
after death, in all his war-clothes, and not to bury him for three days, but to place him in
a sitting posture with his sword and spear in his hands. He comforted them by saying that he
had an inner assurance that he had a terrible encounter before him, but that he would actually
return to this world in about three days. Shortly after this, his breath ceased and his friends
performed all the rites of burial, just as he had requested. For three days his body remained
rigid; at the end of that time, he came back to life and told his open-eyed friends his adventures
as follows: "When my spirit left you, I went directly down the path which leads to the great
tree-trunk, Bintang Sikopa, where Maligang stands; according to his wont, he hailed me and
told me to halt, which I would not do. Then Maligang, whose arm is enormous, many times bigger
than his body, began to shake the tree, calling out 'who are you?' I replied 'I am Gamong,
a brave warrior, and you must not shake the tree while I cross.' Maligang then said, consulting
the pegs with which he records the deeds of men, 'What proof have I that you have been brave?'
At this I was furious, I drew my parang, uplifted my spear and ran amok, rushing into Maligang's
house, smashing everything and overturning the great jars of rice-toddy, of which there is
an abundance, but whereof no one ever drinks. Maligang was frightened and bolted from the house,
shouting as he fled, 'I have not got you now, but in seven years' time you must return.' Finding
that Maligang had fled, and that there were other obstacles to prevent me from going on, I
returned to this world and its trials." The story goes that Gamong lived seven years after
this, and then succumbed body and soul to the great Maligang; and as there is no record of
his bravery, he was probably shaken off of the tree-trunk and disappeared in the deep pit seething
with maggots.

All this veracious history I got by word of mouth from a Kayan of the Tinjar valley.

Almost every medicine man has been down among the spirits of the dead, and in proof of his
assertions, a curiously shaped stone, or a knot of wood, is displayed, which has been given
by the spirits and is endowed with all sorts of marvellous properties. I have in my possession
a Dayong's whole outfit of charms which I bought from his relatives after his death; they were
afraid to touch it, and for another Dayong to use it is taboo of the worst kind. Such charms
are usually buried with the practitioner, but this old fellow evidently did not have a very
large practice, and, at his death, he was somewhat neglected. One of the charms is a stone
in which an active imagination might trace a resemblance to the hand or foot of an animal;
the sorrowing relatives told me, with awe and bated breath, that it was given to their uncle
by a spirit on the top of a mountain, and that it was the foot of a dragon, one of the most
powerful resources of the Dayong pharmacopoeia.

Companions to the stories of visits to the regions below the earth are stories of visits to
the world above the skies, to which adventurous heroes climb either by vines or ropes, which
dangle suddenly in front of them, or by means of lofty trees. "Jack and the Bean Stalk" is
a parallel story in our own folklore. Sir Spencer St. John[1] gives a Dayak account of the
introduction of rice among the Orang Iban, as they call themselves, which states that "when
mankind had nothing to eat but fruit and a species of fungus which grows round the roots of
trees, a party of Ibans, among whom was a man named Si Jura (whose descendants live to this
day in the village of Simpok) went forth to sea. They sailed on for a long time until they
came to a place where they heard the distant roar of a large whirlpool, and, to their amazement,
saw before them a huge fruit tree rooted in the sky and thence hanging down, with its branches
touching the waves. At the request of his companions, Si Jura climbed among its boughs to collect
the fruit, which was in abundance; when he got among the boughs, he was tempted to ascend the
trunk and find how the tree grew in that position. On looking down he saw his companions making
off with the boat loaded with fruit; there was nothing for him to do but go on climbing. At
length he reached the roots of the tree and found himself in the country of the Pleiades [which
the Dayaks call 'the seven chained-stars']; when he stood upon the ground he met a man-like
being, whose name was Si Kira, and he went with him to his house. For food Si Kira offered
to him a mess of soft white grains, and told him to eat. 'What, eat those little maggots?'
said Si Jura. 'They are not maggots, that is boiled rice,' replied Si Kira, and he forthwith
instructed him in the art of planting, weeding, reaping, husking, and boiling rice.

"While Si Kira's wife was out, getting some water, Si Jura peeped into one of the tall jars
that were standing near by, and looking straight through the bottom of it, he could see his
father's house and all his brothers and sisters sitting around talking. His spirits were much
depressed at the remembrance of the home that perhaps he should never see again, and instead
of eating he wept. Si Kira at once saw what was the matter, and assured him that he would arrange
everything satisfactorily for him; then Si Jura fell to and ate a hearty meal, and afterwards
he was given three kinds of rice, and Si Kira further instructed him how to fell the jungle,
burn it, then take the omens from the birds before planting, and when he harvested to hold
a feast. By means of a long rope Si Jura was lowered down to the earth again, close to his
father's house. From his visit to the Pleiades the Dayaks learned all that they know about
farming, and, what is more, to this day the Pleiades themselves tell them when to begin farming,
for, according to their position in the sky in the morning and evening, they cut down the jungle,
burn, plant, and reap."

I think there can be no doubt that Si Kira bestowed a great blessing on the Dayaks when he
gave them rice; but I am very sure that he saddled them with a dire affliction when he introduced
to them the omen-birds; more procrastination, failure of expeditions, and exasperation of soul
can be laid to the score of these birds than to anything else on earth. There is hardly an
undertaking, however slight, that can be begun without first consulting these wretched birds.
Yet it is hardly to be wondered at, that all tribes should hold the birds to be little prophets
of the jungle, dashing across man's path, at critical moments, to bless or to ban. In the deep
jungle, which at high noon is as silent as "sunless retreats of the ocean," gay-plumaged birds
are not sitting on every bough singing plaintive, melodious notes; such lovely pictures exist
solely in the mind of the poet or of him who has never visited the tropics. In the thick tangle
of leaves and branches overhead, the larger birds are seen with difficulty, even after considerable
practice, and the smaller birds appear as but a flash of light, as they dart through the interlacing
palms and vines; the apparition, with its sudden gleam and instant disappearance, starts the
impulse to make a wish, as when we see a star shoot across the heavens. This same natural and
almost irresistible impulse, which we have all experienced, I suggest as one of the explanations
of the tendency of the Bornean mind to accept the birds as the intelligent forerunners of good
or ill. These unsophisticated natives wander forth with some wish in their hearts, and should
a bird of the right species (for not all birds are omen-birds) cross their path, the fulfilment
of their wishes is established beyond a doubt by its mere appearance, and it is to be feared
(for they are mortal) that if they do not want to see the bird--well, there are none so blind
as those who won't see. When it comes to taking omens for such an important event as the planting
of rice, or for going on the warpath, then the ceremony extends over ten days or two weeks,
and the opinion of the small barking deer also must be consulted; furthermore, the whole household
is under the ban of a taboo, or permantang, as they call it, and the people must all stay indoors
while the three men who are appointed as searchers are abroad on their omen-seeking errand.
So firm is their trust in the wisdom of the birds that even if they have worked for months
at a clearing they will abandon it and never plant it, if the omens at the time of sowing be
unfavorable. Certain birds must be seen on the right hand to be favorable, while others are
most propitious when they soar overhead, or give a shrill cry on the left; on more than one
occasion, when traveling in native canoes, a bird which ought to have appeared on the right
has been seen on the left, and, to my utter bewilderment, without a word the boat has been
swung round in the stream so as to bring to the right what was on the left, thus slyly fabricating
a bad omen into a good one, and for some distance we have gone in the opposite direction, but
now with highly favorable omens. When they conclude that the bird has forgotten his warning
or lost sight of us, the boat has been again turned, fate has been deceived, and we journey
on as before. Once our whole party of eight or ten boats had to pull up at the bank and walk
through the jungle for a quarter of a mile or so to make a bothersome white-headed hawk think
that he had mistaken the object of our expedition. When a favorable bird has been seen, a fire
of chips is at once built on the bank of the river, thereby letting the bird know that his
kind attention has been appreciated, Fire is always the go-between of man and the birds, or
any of the spirits; it forms an important part in the ceremonies of consecration and absolution,
and by means of fire a man may break through a taboo, or permantang. Should a man have a fruit-tree,
for instance, which he wishes to protect, he places about it several cleft sticks with stones
thrust in the clefts, and the stones are told to guard the tree and afflict with dire diseases
any pilferer of the fruit. Now, should a friend of the owner see this sign of permantang and
yet wish some of the fruit, let him but build a fire and commission the fire to tell the stones
that he is a friend of the owner, and that it is all right if he takes the fruit; then, when
the fire is burnt out, the fruit may be taken with impunity. In the ceremony of naming a child,
the sacrificial pig is touched with a fire brand before it is harangued by the Dayong, or medicine
man; and to determine whether or not the chosen name be propitious, the strip of rattan which
has been used on the fire-saw to obtain the sacred fire, is bent into a loop until its ends
just meet; it is then set on fire in the middle and allowed to burn through. If the two pieces
thus made are of uneven length the name is good; if they are both the same length another name
must be selected. The ashes from this burning are made into a paste and smeared on the child's
forehead just before it is deluged with a bowl of cold water, and the name is made public for
the first time. It is strange what a similarity exists in different races relative to this
ceremony of giving a name. Why water should be used to confirm the rite, they cannot themselves
explain, except by saying that it is a custom handed down to them from their grandfathers and
their great-great-grandfathers. It can hardly have suggested itself to the minds of the Borneans
as an element of purification and cleansing; to their mind water does not possess these properties.
Water is good to drink when you are thirsty, and refreshing to bathe in when you are hot, that
is all; dirt has no horrors to the Bornean mind, and after a plunge in the river has refreshed
the body, the Kayan, Dayak, Kenyah, Sibop, or whatever the tribe, will put on the same dirty
waist-cloth or cotton jacket that has never known soap, and has seldom if ever been nearer
the water than when on the back of its owner. Perhaps it is that water is symbolic of life
and motion; the river is always moving, it murmurs and talks to itself, a draft of its coolness
and a plunge into its embrace adds new life to man; why should it not be the giver of life?
In almost all the native languages of Borneo the word for water and river is the same; even
when water is brought up into the house it is still the river, and when they drink, they drink
the river; when they boil their rice they boil in the river, and when they name their children
they pour the river over them. Many subtribes or households take their name from the river
on which they live, as, for instance, the Long Patas who live, or used to live, at the mouth
of the Pata river (Long meaning junction of one river with another), the Long Kiputs, the Long
Lamas, and many others that might be named, including the whole tribe of the Kayans, who take
their name from the great Kayan river which empties into the sea on the East coast. If a river
that is new to them be visited, the spirits of that stream must be always propitiated lest
they resent the intrusion and drown the visitor. It is the custom among the Bukits, one of
the most primitive tribes, for the youths, when they reach the bank of a new river, to divest
themselves of every article of clothing, save a chaplet of leaves, which they twist from the
vines near at hand; then crouching at the edge of the water, they toss some personal ornament,
such as a brass ear-ring or a bright bead, far out into mid-stream, and at the same instant
scoop up a handful of the water; gazing earnestly into the few drops which they hold in their
palm, they invoke the spirits of the river to protect them, and implore permission to enter
the new territory. Not until this rite is completed would they dare to bathe in the stream.

To revert to the subject of names; from all that I have read, and from personal observation,
it seems that all Borneans recognize the sanctity of names; of this we may find traces among
all the primitive people of the earth. Before the formal ceremony of naming a child, for instance,
has been performed, the child has no recognized place in the community, and a mother in enumerating
her children would never think of mentioning one that had died before it was named, even though
it had lived a year. Before the ceremony, the intended name is known to no one except the parents,
and, for them to mention it, is strictly permantang until the river water has been poured on
the child's head. A Kayan will never tell you his name, but when asked he invariably turns
to some one sitting near him and asks him to pronounce the name which to the owner is ineffable.
For a man to mention the name of his dead father or mother is a reckless flying in the face
of providence. After a serious illness the name should be changed and never uttered again,
lest the evil spirits revisit their victim; under a new name they will be likely to pass him
by. On one occasion, recognizing a man that I had seen on a former visit, but, at the moment
forgetting his name, I enquired what it was; the name, however, struck me as entirely unfamiliar.
He afterward acknowledged that he had been very sick since I last saw him and now bore a new
name; only the assurance that the spirits could not harm him through a white man induced him
at last to whisper to me his former name. This change of name to deceive the fates extends
even to inanimate objects, and to animals which are to be caught or trapped. When hunting for
camphor, the name of the object of their search must be never mentioned; it is always spoken
of as "the thing that smells." Even all the instruments, which they use in collecting the valuable
drug, have fanciful names, while the searchers talk in a language invented solely for those
who collect camphor. Unless they conform to all these requirements, the camphor crystals, which
in this particular variety are found only in the crevices of the wood, will elude them and
their search be fruitless. When the people go Tuba fishing, which consists of poisoning the
stream with the juice of the Tuba root, and thus stupefying the fish and making them rise to
the surface, where they can be easily caught in nets or speared, they never say that they are
going after fish, but after the leaves which float down stream.

These and many other customs relative to the naming of things are all founded on the same idea
of the potency and mysticism inherent in a name, which may be found in the legends of the old
Egyptians, wherein the power of the great king and god Ra depended on the fact that no one
knew his real name, until Isis by stratagem got it from him; and forthwith his power left him.
It was this same idea that prevented the Hebrew from ever speaking the name of the Most High;
it is probably the same thought which prompts the Japanese to change a person's name after
death lest by mentioning the one known during life the spirit of the dead should be recalled
from the other world.

The downfall of the god Ra brings to mind another superstition of which I have noticed a remnant
among the Borneans also, the power of working charms with the saliva. When the great god Ra
became so old that he no longer had control of his lower jaw, Isis collected some of his saliva
which dropped upon the ground below his throne, and mixing it with clay, made a snake of it.
(I quote from the "Turin Papyrus," of which Mr. EDWARD CLODD gives a translation in his recent
and valuable little book called "Tom Tit Tot.") This snake Isis left in Ra's path; as he passed
by, it bit him, and to relieve him of his agony Isis persuaded him that the only thing to be
done was to tell her his true name that she might drive out the pain from his bones. This he
finally did, and with disastrous results. I instance this to show the antiquity of the superstition
that the saliva is potent as an ingredient of charms; the Kayans illustrate this, in the manner
whereby they elude an evil spirit which may have been following them on a journey on the river.
They build a small archway of boughs on the bank just before they arrive at their destination.
Underneath this arch, they build a fire and, in single file, all pass under, stepping over
the fire and spitting into it as they pass; by this act they thoroughly exorcise the evil spirits
and emerge on the other side free from all baleful influence. Another instance, is where they
are throwing aside the signs of mourning for the dead; during the period of mourning they may
not cut their hair nor shave their temples, but as soon as the mourning is ended by the ceremony
of bringing home a newly-taken head, the barber's knife is kept busy enough. As every man leaves
the barber's hands, he gathers up the hair, and, spitting on it, murmurs a prayer to the evil
spirits not to harm him. He then blows the hair out of the verandah of the house.

All these parallelisms, in the modes of thinking, among men in far removed quarters of the
earth, do not, I think, necessarily imply that there has been a transmission of thought from
one race to the other, but that there is a certain round of thought through which the brain
leads us, and in development we must all have followed along the same path. Some races have
made more rapid strides than others, possibly owing to natural surroundings, and in their strides
have left the others centuries behind. Almost within the memory of our grandfathers, in this
country, witches were burned, and from this there is only a step back to the Dayong of Borneo.
Indeed, whosoever sees these people and lives with them their everyday life, must regard them,
after a not very long time, merely as backward pupils in the school of life. Let me say in
conclusion, that he would have an unresponsive heart that could not feel linked in a bond of
fellowship with these people, and that God has made of only one blood all nations of the earth,
when he hears a Bornean mother crooning her child to sleep with words identical in sentiment
with "Rock-a-bye Baby,"--what though the mother's earlobes are elongated many an inch by heavy
copper rings, her arms tattooed to the elbow, and her blackened teeth filed to points. Once
upon a time I heard a Kayan mother soothing her little baby to sleep, and the words of the
lullaby which I learned are as follows:--

     From the River's mouth the birds are straying,
     And the Baiyo's topmost leaves are swaying;
           The little chicks cheep,
           Now my little one sleep,
     For the black house-lizard, with glittering eye,
     And the gray-haired Laki Laieng are nigh!
           Sleep, dear little one, sleep!

For those philologically inclined I append the original:--

     Lung koh madang Manoh
     Migieong ujong Baiyo
     Mensip anak Yap
     Lamate Telyap, Telyap abing,
     Lamate Laki Laieng oban!
                   Ara we we ara!
