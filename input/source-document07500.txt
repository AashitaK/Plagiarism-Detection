THE LAYING OF THE FOUNDATIONS.

CHAPTER I.

HISTORICAL SURVEY.

The second century of the existence of Gentile-Christian communities was characterised by the
victorious conflict with Gnosticism and the Marcionite Church, by the gradual development of
an ecclesiastical doctrine, and by the decay of the early Christian enthusiasm. The general
result was the establishment of a great ecclesiastical association, which, forming at one and
the same time a political commonwealth, school and union for worship, was based on the firm
foundation of an "apostolic" law of faith, a collection of "apostolic" writings, and finally,
an "apostolic" organisation. This institution was the Catholic Church.[1] In opposition to
Gnosticism and Marcionitism, the main articles forming the estate and possession of orthodox
Christianity were raised to the rank of apostolic regulations and laws, and thereby placed
beyond all discussion and assault. At first the innovations introduced by this were not of
a material, but of a formal, character. Hence they were not noticed by any of those who had
never, or only in a vague fashion, been elevated to the feeling and idea of freedom and independence
in religion. How great the innovations actually were, however, may be measured by the fact
that they signified a scholastic tutelage of the faith of the individual Christian, and restricted
the immediateness of religious feelings and ideas to the narrowest limits. But the conflict
with the so-called Montanism showed that there were still a considerable number of Christians
who valued that immediateness and freedom; these were, however, defeated. The fixing of the
tradition under the title of apostolic necessarily led to the assumption that whoever held
the apostolic doctrine was also essentially a Christian in the apostolic sense. This assumption,
quite apart from the innovations which were legitimised by tracing them to the Apostles, meant
the separation of doctrine and conduct, the preference of the former to the latter, and the
transformation of a fellowship of faith, hope, and discipline into a communion "eiusdem sacramenti,"
that is, into a union which, like the philosophical schools, rested on a doctrinal law, and
which was subject to a legal code of divine institution.[2]

The movement which resulted in the Catholic Church owes its right to a place in the history
of Christianity to the victory over Gnosticism and to the preservation of an important part
of early Christian tradition. If Gnosticism in all its phases was the violent attempt to drag
Christianity down to the level of the Greek world, and to rob it of its dearest possession,
belief in the Almighty God of creation and redemption, then Catholicism, inasmuch as it secured
this belief for the Greeks, preserved the Old Testament, and supplemented it with early Christian
writings, thereby saving--as far as documents, at least, were concerned--and proclaiming the
authority of an important part of primitive Christianity, must in one respect be acknowledged
as a conservative force born from the vigour of Christianity. If we put aside abstract considerations
and merely look at the facts of the given situation, we cannot but admire a creation which
first broke up the various outside forces assailing Christianity, and in which the highest
blessings of this faith have always continued to be accessible. If the founder of the Christian
religion had deemed belief in the Gospel and a life in accordance with it to be compatible
with membership of the Synagogue and observance of the Jewish law, there could at least be
no impossibility of adhering to the Gospel within the Catholic Church.

Still, that is only one side of the case. The older Catholicism never clearly put the question,
"What is Christian?" Instead of answering that question it rather laid down rules, the recognition
of which was to be the guarantee of Christianism. This solution of the problem seems to be
on the one hand too narrow and on the other too broad. Too narrow, because it bound Christianity
to rules under which it necessarily languished; too broad, because it did not in any way exclude
the introduction of new and foreign conceptions. In throwing a protective covering round the
Gospel, Catholicism also obscured it. It preserved Christianity from being hellenised to the
most extreme extent, but, as time went on, it was forced to admit into this religion an ever
greater measure of secularisation. In the interests of its world-wide mission it did not indeed
directly disguise the terrible seriousness of religion, but, by tolerating a less strict ideal
of life, it made it possible for those less in earnest to be considered Christians, and to
regard themselves as such. It permitted the genesis of a Church, which was no longer a communion
of faith, hope, and discipline, but a political commonwealth in which the Gospel merely had
a place beside other things.[3] In ever increasing measure it invested all the forms which
this secular commonwealth required with apostolic, that is, indirectly, with divine authority.
This course disfigured Christianity and made a knowledge of what is Christian an obscure and
difficult matter. But, in Catholicism, religion for the first time obtained a formal dogmatic
system. Catholic Christianity discovered the formula which reconciled faith and knowledge.
This formula satisfied humanity for centuries, and the blessed effects which it accomplished
continued to operate even after it had itself already become a fetter.

Catholic Christianity grew out of two converging series of developments. In the one were set
up fixed outer standards for determining what is Christian, and these standards were proclaimed
to be apostolic institutions. The baptismal confession was exalted to an apostolic rule of
faith, that is, to an apostolic law of faith. A collection of apostolic writings was formed
from those read in the Churches, and this compilation was placed on an equal footing with the
Old Testament. The episcopal and monarchical constitution was declared to be apostolic, and
the attribute of successor of the Apostles was conferred on the bishop. Finally, the religious
ceremonial developed into a celebration of mysteries, which was in like manner traced back
to the Apostles. The result of these institutions was a strictly exclusive Church in the form
of a communion of doctrine, ceremonial, and law, a confederation which more and more gathered
the various communities within its pale, and brought about the decline of all nonconforming
sects. The confederation was primarily based on a common confession, which, however, was not
only conceived as "law," but was also very soon supplemented by new standards. One of the most
important problems to be investigated in the history of dogma, and one which unfortunately
cannot be completely solved, is to show what necessities led to the setting up of a new canon
of Scripture, what circumstances required the appearance of living authorities in the communities,
and what relation was established between the apostolic rule of faith, the apostolic canon
of Scripture, and the apostolic office. The development ended with the formation of a clerical
class, at whose head stood the bishop, who united in himself all conceivable powers, as teacher,
priest, and judge. He disposed of the powers of Christianity, guaranteed its purity, and therefore
in every respect held the Christian laity in tutelage.

But even apart from the content which Christianity here received, this process in itself represents
a progressive secularising of the Church, This would be self-evident enough, even if it were
not confirmed by noting the fact that the process had already been to some extent anticipated
in the so-called Gnosticism (See vol. I. p. 253 and Tertullian, de præscr. 35). But the element
which the latter lacked, namely, a firmly welded, suitably regulated constitution, must by
no means be regarded as one originally belonging and essential to Christianity. The depotentiation
to which Christianity was here subjected appears still more plainly in the facts, that the
Christian hopes were deadened, that the secularising of the Christian life was tolerated and
even legitimised, and that the manifestations of an unconditional devotion to the heavenly
excited suspicion or were compelled to confine themselves to very narrow limits.

But these considerations are scarcely needed as soon as we turn our attention to the second
series of developments that make up the history of this period. The Church did not merely set
up dykes and walls against Gnosticism in order to ward it off externally, nor was she satisfied
with defending against it the facts which were the objects of her belief and hope; but, taking
the creed for granted, she began to follow this heresy into its own special territory and to
combat it with a scientific theology. That was a necessity which did not first spring from
Christianity's own internal struggles. It was already involved in the fact that the Christian
Church had been joined by cultured Greeks, who felt the need of justifying their Christianity
to themselves and the world, and of presenting it as the desired and certain answer to all
the pressing questions which then occupied men's minds.

The beginning of a development which a century later reached its provisional completion in
the theology of Origen, that is, in the transformation of the Gospel into a scientific system
of ecclesiastical doctrine, appears in the Christian Apologetic, as we already find it before
the middle of the second century. As regards its content, this system of doctrine meant the
legitimising of Greek philosophy within the sphere of the rule of faith. The theology of Origen
bears the same relation to the New Testament as that of Philo does to the Old. What is here
presented as Christianity is in fact the idealistic religious philosophy of the age, attested
by divine revelation, made accessible to all by the incarnation of the Logos, and purified
from any connection with Greek mythology and gross polytheism.[4] A motley multitude of primitive
Christian ideas and hopes, derived from both Testaments, and too brittle to be completely recast,
as yet enclosed the kernel. But the majority of these were successfully manipulated by theological
art, and the traditional rule of faith was transformed into a system of doctrine, in which,
to some extent, the old articles found only a nominal place.[5]

This hellenising of ecclesiastical Christianity, by which we do not mean the Gospel, was not
a gradual process; for the truth rather is that it was already accomplished the moment that
the reflective Greek confronted the new religion which he had accepted. The Christianity of
men like Justin, Athenagoras, and Minucius is not a whit less Hellenistic than that of Origen.
But yet an important distinction obtains here. It is twofold. In the first place, those Apologists
did not yet find themselves face to face with a fixed collection of writings having a title
to be reverenced as Christian; they have to do with the Old Testament and the "Teachings of
Christ" ([Greek: didagmata Christou]). In the second place, they do not yet regard the scientific
presentation of Christianity as the main task and as one which this religion itself demands.
As they really never enquired what was meant by "Christian," or at least never put the question
clearly to themselves, they never claimed that their scientific presentation of Christianity
was the first proper expression of it that had been given. Justin and his contemporaries make
it perfectly clear that they consider the traditional faith existing in the churches to be
complete and pure and in itself requiring no scientific revision. In a word, the gulf which
existed between the religious thought of philosophers and the sum of Christian tradition is
still altogether unperceived, because that tradition was not yet fixed in rigid forms, because
no religious utterance testifying to monotheism, virtue, and reward was as yet threatened by
any control, and finally, because the speech of philosophy was only understood by a small minority
in the Church, though its interests and aims were not unknown to most. Christian thinkers were
therefore still free to divest of their direct religious value all realistic and historical
elements of the tradition, while still retaining them as parts of a huge apparatus of proof,
which accomplished what was really the only thing that many sought in Christianity, viz., the
assurance that the theory of the world obtained from other sources was the truth. The danger
which here threatened Christianity as a religion was scarcely less serious than that which
had been caused to it by the Gnostics. These remodelled tradition, the Apologists made it to
some extent inoperative without attacking it. The latter were not disowned, but rather laid
the foundation of Church theology, and determined the circle of interests within which it was
to move in the future.[6]

But the problem which the Apologists solved almost offhand, namely, the task of showing that
Christianity was the perfect and certain philosophy, because it rested on revelation, and that
it was the highest scientific knowledge of God and the world, was to be rendered more difficult.
To these difficulties all that primitive Christianity has up to the present transmitted to
the Church of succeeding times contributes its share. The conflict with Gnosticism made it
necessary to find some sort of solution to the question, "What is Christian?" and to fix this
answer. But indeed the Fathers were not able to answer the question confidently and definitely.
They therefore made a selection from tradition and contented themselves with making it binding
on Christians. Whatever was to lay claim to authority in the Church had henceforth to be in
harmony with the rule of faith and the canon of New Testament Scriptures. That created an entirely
new situation for Christian thinkers, that is, for those trying to solve the problem of subordinating
Christianity to the Hellenic spirit. That spirit never became quite master of the situation;
it was obliged to accommodate itself to it.[7] The work first began with the scientific treatment
of individual articles contained in the rule of faith, partly with the view of disproving Gnostic
conceptions, partly for the purpose of satisfying the Church's own needs. The framework in
which these articles were placed virtually continued to be the apologetic theology, for this
maintained a doctrine of God and the world, which seemed to correspond to the earliest tradition
as much as it ran counter to the Gnostic theses. (Melito), Irenæus, Tertullian and Hippolytus,
aided more or less by tradition on the one hand and by philosophy on the other, opposed to
the Gnostic dogmas about Christianity the articles of the baptismal confession interpreted
as a rule of faith, these articles being developed into doctrines. Here they undoubtedly learned
very much from the Gnostics and Marcion. If we define ecclesiastical dogmas as propositions
handed down in the creed of the Church, shown to exist in the Holy Scriptures of both Testaments,
and rationally reproduced and formulated, then the men we have just mentioned were the first
to set up dogmas[8]--dogmas but no system of dogmatics. As yet the difficulty of the problem
was by no means perceived by these men either. Their peculiar capacity for sympathising with
and understanding the traditional and the old still left them in a happy blindness. So far
as they had a theology they supposed it to be nothing more than the explanation of the faith
of the Christian multitude (yet Tertullian already noted the difference in one point, certainly
a very characteristic one, viz., the Logos doctrine). They still lived in the belief that the
Christianity which filled their minds required no scientific remodelling in order to be an
expression of the highest knowledge, and that it was in all respects identical with the Christianity
which even the most uncultivated could grasp. That this was an illusion is proved by many considerations,
but most convincingly by the fact that Tertullian and Hippolytus had the main share in introducing
into the doctrine of faith a philosophically formulated dogma, viz., that the Son of God is
the Logos, and in having it made the articulus constitutivus ecclesiæ. The effects of this
undertaking can never be too highly estimated, for the Logos doctrine is Greek philosophy in
nuce, though primitive Christian views may have been subsequently incorporated with it. Its
introduction into the creed of Christendom, which was, strictly speaking, the setting up of
the first dogma in the Church, meant the future conversion of the rule of faith into a philosophic
system. But in yet another respect Irenæus and Hippolytus denote an immense advance beyond
the Apologists, which, paradoxically enough, results both from the progress of Christian Hellenism
and from a deeper study of the Pauline theology, that is, emanates from the controversy with
Gnosticism. In them a religious and realistic idea takes the place of the moralism of the Apologists,
namely, the deifying of the human race through the incarnation of the Son of God. The apotheosis
of mortal man through his acquisition of immortality (divine life) is the idea of salvation
which was taught in the ancient mysteries. It is here adopted as a Christian one, supported
by the Pauline theology (especially as contained in the Epistle to the Ephesians), and brought
into the closest connection with the historical Christ, the Son of God and Son of man (filius
dei et filius hominis). What the heathen faintly hoped for as a possibility was here announced
as certain, and indeed as having already taken place. What a message! This conception was to
become the central Christian idea of the future. A long time, however, elapsed before it made
its way into the dogmatic system of the Church.[9]

But meanwhile the huge gulf which existed between both Testaments and the rule of faith on
the one hand, and the current ideas of the time on the other, had been recognized in Alexandria.
It was not indeed felt as a gulf, for then either the one or the other would have had to be
given up, but as a problem. If the Church tradition contained the assurance, not to be obtained
elsewhere, of all that Greek culture knew, hoped for, and prized, and if for that very reason
it was regarded as in every respect inviolable, then the absolutely indissoluble union of Christian
tradition with the Greek philosophy of religion was placed beyond all doubt. But an immense
number of problems were at the same time raised, especially when, as in the case of the Alexandrians,
heathen syncretism in the entire breadth of its development was united with the doctrine of
the Church. The task, which had been begun by Philo and carried on by Valentinus and his school,
was now undertaken in the Church. Clement led the way in attempting a solution of the problem,
but the huge task proved too much for him. Origen took it up under more difficult circumstances,
and in a certain fashion brought it to a conclusion. He, the rival of the Neoplatonic philosophers,
the Christian Philo, wrote the first Christian dogmatic, which competed with the philosophic
systems of the time, and which, founded on the Scriptures of both Testaments, presents a peculiar
union of the apologetic theology of a Justin and the Gnostic theology of a Valentinus, while
keeping steadily in view a simple and highly practical aim. In this dogmatic the rule of faith
is recast and that quite consciously. Origen did not conceal his conviction that Christianity
finds its correct expression only in scientific knowledge, and that every form of Christianity
that lacks theology is but a meagre kind with no clear consciousness of its own content. This
conviction plainly shows that Origen was dealing with a different kind of Christianity, though
his view that a mere relative distinction existed here may have its justification in the fact,
that the untheological Christianity of the age with which he compared his own was already permeated
by Hellenic elements and in a very great measure secularised.[10] But Origen, as well as Clement
before him, had really a right to the conviction that the true essence of Christianity, or,
in other words, the Gospel, is only arrived at by the aid of critical speculation; for was
not the Gospel veiled and hidden in the canon of both Testaments, was it not displaced by the
rule of faith, was it not crushed down, depotentiated, and disfigured in the Church which identified
itself with the people of Christ? Clement and Origen found freedom and independence in what
they recognized to be the essence of the matter and what they contrived with masterly skill
to determine as its proper aim, after an examination of the huge apparatus of tradition. But
was not that the ideal of Greek sages and philosophers? This question can by no means be flatly
answered in the negative, and still less decidedly in the affirmative, for a new significance
was here given to the ideal by representing it as assured beyond all doubt, already realised
in the person of Christ and incompatible with polytheism. If, as is manifestly the case, they
found joy and peace in their faith and in the theory of the universe connected with it, if
they prepared themselves for an eternal life and expected it with certainty, if they felt themselves
to be perfect only through dependence on God, then, in spite of their Hellenism, they unquestionably
came nearer to the Gospel than Irenæus with his slavish dependence on authority.

The setting up of a scientific system of Christian dogmatics, which was still something different
from the rule of faith, interpreted in an Antignostic sense, philosophically wrought out, and
in some parts proved from the Bible, was a private undertaking of Origen, and at first only
approved in limited circles. As yet, not only were certain bold changes of interpretation disputed
in the Church, but the undertaking itself, as a whole, was disapproved.[11] The circumstances
of the several provincial churches in the first half of the third century were still very diverse.
Many communities had yet to adopt the basis that made them into Catholic ones; and in most,
if not in all, the education of the clergy--not to speak of the laity--was not high enough
to enable them to appreciate systematic theology. But the schools in which Origen taught carried
on his work, similar ones were established, and these produced a number of the bishops and
presbyters of the East in the last half of the third century. They had in their hands the means
of culture afforded by the age, and this was all the more a guarantee of victory because the
laity no longer took any part in deciding the form of religion. Wherever the Logos Christology
had been adopted the future of Christian Hellenism was certain. At the beginning of the fourth
century there was no community in Christendom which, apart from the Logos doctrine, possessed
a purely philosophical theory that was regarded as an ecclesiastical dogma, to say nothing
of an official scientific theology. But the system of Origen was a prophecy of the future.
The Logos doctrine started the crystallising process which resulted in further deposits. Symbols
of faith were already drawn up which contained a peculiar mixture of Origen's theology with
the inflexible Antignostic regula fidei. One celebrated theologian, Methodius, endeavoured
to unite the theology of Irenæus and Origen, ecclesiastical realism and philosophic spiritualism,
under the badge of monastic mysticism. The developments of the following period therefore no
longer appear surprising in any respect.

As Catholicism, from every point of view, is the result of the blending of Christianity with
the ideas of antiquity,[12] so the Catholic dogmatic, as it was developed after the second
or third century on the basis of the Logos doctrine, is Christianity conceived and formulated
from the standpoint of the Greek philosophy of religion.[13] This Christianity conquered the
old world, and became the foundation of a new phase of history in the Middle Ages. The union
of the Christian religion with a definite historical phase of human knowledge and culture may
be lamented in the interest of the Christian religion, which was thereby secularised, and in
the interest of the development of culture which was thereby retarded(?). But lamentations
become here ill-founded assumptions, as absolutely everything that we have and value is due
to the alliance that Christianity and antiquity concluded in such a way that neither was able
to prevail over the other. Our inward and spiritual life, which owes the least part of its
content to the empiric knowledge which we have acquired, is based up to the present moment
on the discords resulting from that union.

These hints are meant among other things to explain and justify[14] the arrangement chosen
for the following presentation, which embraces the fundamental section of the history of Christian
dogma.[15] A few more remarks are, however, necessary.

1. One special difficulty in ascertaining the genesis of the Catholic rules is that the churches,
though on terms of close connection and mutual intercourse, had no real forum publicum, though
indeed, in a certain sense, each bishop was in foro publico. As a rule, therefore, we can only
see the advance in the establishment of fixed forms in the shape of results, without being
able to state precisely the ways and means which led to them. We do indeed know the factors,
and can therefore theoretically construct the development; but the real course of things is
frequently hidden from us. The genesis of a harmonious Church, firmly welded together in doctrine
and constitution, can no more have been the natural unpremeditated product of the conditions
of the time than were the genesis and adoption of the New Testament canon of Scripture. But
we have no direct evidence as to what communities had a special share in the development, although
we know that the Roman Church played a leading part. Moreover, we can only conjecture that
conferences, common measures, and synodical decisions were not wanting. It is certain that,
beginning with the last quarter of the second century, there were held in the different provinces,
mostly in the East, but later also in the West, Synods in which an understanding was arrived
at on all questions of importance to Christianity, including, e.g., the extent of the canon.[16]

2. The degree of influence exercised by particular ecclesiastics on the development of the
Church and its doctrines is also obscure and difficult to determine. As they were compelled
to claim the sanction of tradition for every innovation they introduced, and did in fact do
so, and as every fresh step they took appeared to themselves necessary only as an explanation,
it is in many cases quite impossible to distinguish between what they received from tradition
and what they added to it of their own. Yet an investigation from the point of view of the
historian of literature shows that Tertullian and Hippolytus were to a great extent dependent
on Irenæus. What amount of innovation these men independently contributed can therefore still
be ascertained. Both are men of the second generation. Tertullian is related to Irenæus pretty
much as Calvin to Luther. This parallel holds good in more than one respect. First, Tertullian
drew up a series of plain dogmatic formulæ which are not found in Irenæus and which proved
of the greatest importance in succeeding times. Secondly, he did not attain the power, vividness,
and unity of religious intuition which distinguish Irenæus. The truth rather is that, just
because of his forms, he partly destroyed the unity of the matter and partly led it into a
false path of development. Thirdly, he everywhere endeavoured to give a conception of Christianity
which represented it as the divine law, whereas in Irenæus this idea is overshadowed by the
conception of the Gospel as real redemption. The main problem therefore resolves itself into
the question as to the position of Irenæus in the history of the Church. To what extent were
his expositions new, to what extent were the standards he formulated already employed in the
Churches, and in which of them? We cannot form to ourselves a sufficiently vivid picture of
the interchange of Christian writings in the Church after the last quarter of the second century.[17]
Every important work speedily found its way into the churches of the chief cities in the Empire.
The diffusion was not merely from East to West, though this was the general rule. At the beginning
of the fourth century there was in Cæsarea a Greek translation of Tertullian's Apology and
a collection of Cyprian's epistles.[18] The influence of the Roman Church extended over the
greater part of Christendom. Up till about the year 260 the Churches in East and West had still
in some degree a common history.

3. The developments in the history of dogma within the period extending from about 150 to about
300 were by no means brought about in the different communities at the same time and in a completely
analogous fashion. This fact is in great measure concealed from us, because our authorities
are almost completely derived from those leading Churches that were connected with each other
by constant intercourse. Yet the difference can still be clearly proved by the ratio of development
in Rome, Lyons, and Carthage on the one hand, and in Alexandria on the other. Besides, we have
several valuable accounts showing that in more remote provinces and communities the development
was slower, and a primitive and freer condition of things much longer preserved.[19]

4. From the time that the clergy acquired complete sway over the Churches, that is, from the
beginning of the second third of the third century, the development of the history of dogma
practically took place within the ranks of that class, and was carried on by its learned men.
Every mystery they set up therefore became doubly mysterious to the laity, for these did not
even understand the terms, and hence it formed another new fetter.

[Footnote 1: Aubé (Histoire des Persécutions de l'Eglise, Vol. II. 1878, pp. 1-68) has given
a survey of the genesis of ecclesiastical dogma. The disquisitions of Renan in the last volumes
of his great historical work are excellent, though not seldom exaggerated in particular points.
See especially the concluding observations in Vol. VII. cc. 28-34. Since the appearance of
Ritschl's monograph on the genesis of the old Catholic Church, a treatise which, however, forms
too narrow a conception of the problem, German science can point to no work of equal rank with
the French. Cf. Sohm's Kirchenrecht, Vol. I. which, however, in a very one-sided manner, makes
the adoption of the legal and constitutional arrangements responsible for all the evil in the
Church.]

[Footnote 2: Sohm (p. 160) declares: "The foundation of Catholicism is the divine Church law
to which it lays claim." In many other passages he even seems to express the opinion that the
Church law of itself, even when not represented as divine, is the hereditary enemy of the true
Church and at the same time denotes the essence of Catholicism. See, e.g., p. 2: "The whole
essence of Catholicism consists in its declaring legal institutions to be necessary to the
Church." Page 700: "The essence of Church law is incompatible with the essence of the Church."
This thesis really characterises Catholicism well and contains a great truth, if expressed
in more careful terms, somewhat as follows: "The assertion that there is a divine Church law
(emanating from Christ, or, in other words, from the Apostles), which is necessary to the spiritual
character of the Church and which in fact is a token of this very attribute, is incompatible
with the essence of the Gospel and is the mark of a pseudo-Catholicism." But the thesis contains
too narrow a view of the case. For the divine Church law is only one feature of the essence
of the Catholic Church, though a very important element, which Sohm, as a jurist, was peculiarly
capable of recognising. The whole essence of Catholicism, however, consists in the deification
of tradition generally. The declaration that the empirical institutions of the Church, created
for and necessary to this purpose, are apostolic, a declaration which amalgamates them with
the essence and content of the Gospel and places them beyond all criticism, is the peculiarly
"Catholic" feature. Now, as a great part of these institutions cannot be inwardly appropriated
and cannot really amalgamate with faith and piety, it is self-evident that such portions become
continued: legal ordinances, to which obedience must be rendered. For no other relation to
these ordinances can be conceived. Hence the legal regulations and the corresponding slavish
devotion come to have such immense scope in Catholicism, and well-nigh express its essence.
But behind this is found the more general conviction that the empirical Church, as it actually
exists, is the authentic, pure, and infallible creation: its doctrine, its regulations, its
religious ceremonial are apostolic. Whoever doubts that renounces Christ. Now, if, as in the
case of the Reformers, this conception be recognised as erroneous and unevangelical, the result
must certainly be a strong detestation of "the divine Church law." Indeed, the inclination
to sweep away all Church law is quite intelligible, for when you give the devil your little
finger he takes the whole hand. But, on the other hand, it cannot be imagined how communities
are to exist on earth, propagate themselves, and train men without regulations; and how regulations
are to exist without resulting in the formation of a code of laws. In truth, such regulations
have at no time been wanting in Christian communities, and have always possessed the character
of a legal code. Sohm's distinction, that in the oldest period there was no "law," but only
a "regulation," is artificial, though possessed of a certain degree of truth; for the regulation
has one aspect in a circle of like-minded enthusiasts, and a different one in a community where
all stages of moral and religious culture are represented, and which has therefore to train
its members. Or should it not do so? And, on the other hand, had the oldest Churches not the
Old Testament and the [Greek: diataxeis] of the Apostles? Were these no code of laws? Sohm's
proposition: "The essence of Church law is incompatible with the essence of the Church," does
not rise to evangelical clearness and freedom, but has been formed under the shadow and ban
of Catholicism. I am inclined to call it an Anabaptist thesis. The Anabaptists were also in
the shadow and ban of Catholicism; hence their only course was either the attempt to wreck
the Church and Church history and found a new empire, or a return to Catholicism. Hermann Bockelson
or the Pope! But the Gospel is above the question of Jew or Greek, and therefore also above
the question of a legal code. It is reconcilable with everything that is not sin, even with
the philosophy of the Greeks. Why should it not be also compatible with the monarchical bishop,
with the legal code of the Romans, and even with the Pope, provided these are not made part
of the Gospel.]

[Footnote 3: In the formation of the Marcionite Church we have, on the other hand, the attempt
to create a rigid oecumenical community, held together solely by religion. The Marcionite Church
therefore had a founder, the Catholic has none.]

[Footnote 4: The historian who wishes to determine the advance made by Græco-Roman humanity
in the third and fourth centuries, under the influence of Catholicism and its theology, must
above all keep in view the fact that gross polytheism and immoral mythology were swept away,
spiritual monotheism brought near to all, and the ideal of a divine life and the hope of an
eternal one made certain. Philosophy also aimed at that, but it was not able to establish a
community of men on these foundations.]

[Footnote 5: Luther, as is well known, had a very profound impression of the distinction between
Biblical Christianity and the theology of the Fathers, who followed the theories of Origen.
See, for example, Werke, Vol. LXII. p. 49, quoting Proles: "When the word of God comes to the
Fathers, me thinks it is as if milk were filtered through a coal sack, where the milk must
become black and spoiled."]

[Footnote 6: They were not the first to determine this circle of interests. So far as we can
demonstrate traces of independent religious knowledge among the so-called Apostolic Fathers
of the post-apostolic age, they are in thorough harmony with the theories of the Apologists,
which are merely expressed with precision and divested of Old Testament language.]

[Footnote 7: It was only after the apostolic tradition, fixed in the form of a comprehensive
collection, seemed to guarantee the admissibility of every form of Christianity that reverenced
that collection, that the hellenising of Christianity within the Church began in serious fashion.
The fixing of tradition had had a twofold result. On the one hand, it opened the way more than
ever before for a free and unhesitating introduction of foreign ideas into Christianity, and,
on the other hand, so far as it really also included the documents and convictions of primitive
Christianity, it preserved this religion to the future and led to a return to it, either from
scientific or religious considerations. That we know anything at all of original Christianity
is entirely due to the fixing of the tradition, as found at the basis of Catholicism. On the
supposition--which is indeed an academic consideration--that this fixing had not taken place
because of the non-appearance of the Gnosticism which occasioned it, and on the further supposition
that the original enthusiasm had continued, we would in all probability know next to nothing
of original Christianity today. How much we would have known may be seen from the Shepherd
of Hermas.]

[Footnote 8: So far as the Catholic Church is concerned, the idea of dogmas, as individual
theorems characteristic of Christianity, and capable of being scholastically proved, originated
with the Apologists. Even as early as Justin we find tendencies to amalgamate historical material
and natural theology.]

[Footnote 9: It is almost completely wanting in Tertullian. That is explained by the fact that
this remarkable man was in his inmost soul an old-fashioned Christian, to whom the Gospel was
conscientia religionis, disciplina vitæ and spes fidei, and who found no sort of edification
in Neoplatonic notions, but rather dwelt on the ideas "command," "performance," "error," "forgiveness."
In Irenæus also, moreover, the ancient idea of salvation, supplemented by elements derived
from the Pauline theology, is united with the primitive Christian eschatology.]

[Footnote 10: On the significance of Clement and Origen see Overbeck, "Über die Anfänge der
patristischen Litteratur" in d. Hist. Ztschr, N. F., Vol, XII. p. 417 ff.]

[Footnote 11: Information on this point may be got not only from the writings of Origen (see
especially his work against Celsus), but also and above all from his history. The controversy
between Dionysius of Alexandria and the Chiliasts is also instructive on the matter.]

[Footnote 12: The three or (reckoning Methodius) four steps of the development of church doctrine
(Apologists, Old Catholic Fathers, Alexandrians) correspond to the progressive religious and
philosophical development of heathendom at that period: philosophic moralism, ideas of salvation
(theology and practice of mysteries), Neoplatonic philosophy, and complete syncretism.]

[Footnote 13: "Virtus omnis ex his causam accipit, a quibus provocatur" (Tertull., de bapt. 2.)]

[Footnote 14: The plan of placing the apologetic theology before everything else would have
much to recommend it, but I adhere to the arrangement here chosen, because the advantage of
being able to represent and survey the outer ecclesiastical development and the inner theological
one, each being viewed as a unity, seems to me to be very great. We must then of course understand
the two developments as proceeding on parallel lines. But the placing of the former parallel
before the latter in my presentation is justified by the fact that what was gained in the former
passed over much more directly and swiftly into the general life of the Church, than what was
reached in the latter. Decades elapsed, for instance, before the apologetic theology came to
be generally known and accepted in the Church, as is shown by the long continued conflict against
Monarchianism.]

[Footnote 15: The origin of Catholicism can only be very imperfectly described within the framework
of the history of dogma, for the political situation of the Christian communities in the Roman
Empire had quite as important an influence on the development of the Catholic Church as its
internal conflicts. But inasmuch as that situation and these struggles are ultimately connected
in the closest way, the history of dogma cannot even furnish a complete picture of this development
within definite limits.]

We must also take into account here the intercourse by letter, in which connection I may specially
remind the reader of the correspondence between Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, Euseb., H. E.

[Footnote 19: See the accounts of Christianity in Edessa and the far East generally. The Acta
Archelai and the Homilies of Aphraates should also be specially examined. Cf. further Euseb.,
H. E. VI. 12, and finally the remains of the Latin-Christian literature of the third century--apart
from Tertullian, Cyprian and Novatian--as found partly under the name of Cyprian, partly under
other titles. Commodian, Arnobius, and Lactantius are also instructive here. In chap. 21 we
find: "It is plain that all teaching that agrees with those apostolic Churches which are the
wombs and origins of the faith must be set down as truth, it being certain that such doctrine
contains that which the Church received from the Apostles, the Apostles from Christ, and Christ
from God." In chap. 36 we read: "Let us see what it (the Roman Church) has learned, what it
has taught, and what fellowship it has likewise had with the African Churches. It acknowledges
one God the Lord, the creator of the universe, and Jesus Christ, the Son of God the creator,
born of the Virgin Mary, as well as the resurrection of the flesh. It unites the Law and the
Prophets with the writings of the Evangelists and Apostles. From these it draws its faith,
and by their authority it seals this faith with water, clothes it with the Holy Spirit, feeds
it with the eucharist, and encourages martyrdom. Hence it receives no one who rejects this
institution." In chap. 32 the following challenge is addressed to the heretics: "Let them unfold
a series of their bishops proceeding by succession from the beginning in such a way that this
first bishop of theirs had as his authority and predecessor some one of the Apostles or one
of the apostolic men, who, however, associated with the Apostles."[21] From the consideration
of these three passages it directly follows that three standards are to be kept in view, viz.,
the apostolic doctrine, the apostolic canon of Scripture, and the guarantee of apostolic authority,
afforded by the organisation of the Church, that is, by the episcopate, and traced back to
apostolic institution. It will be seen that the Church always adopted these three standards
together, that is simultaneously.[22] As a matter of fact they originated in Rome and gradually
made their way in the other Churches. That Asia Minor had a share in this is probable, though
the question is involved in obscurity. The three Catholic standards had their preparatory stages,
(1) in short kerygmatic creeds; (2) in the authority of the Lord and the formless apostolic
tradition as well as in the writings read in the Churches; (3) in the veneration paid to apostles,
prophets, and teachers, or the "elders" and leaders of the individual communities.

A. The Transformation of the Baptismal Confession into the Apostolic Rule of Faith.

It has been explained (vol. I. p. 157) that the idea of the complete identity of what the Churches
possessed as Christian communities with the doctrine or regulations of the twelve Apostles
can already be shown in the earliest Gentile-Christian literature. In the widest sense the
expression, [Greek: kanôn tês paradoseôs] (canon of tradition), originally included all that
was traced back to Christ himself through the medium of the Apostles and was of value for the
faith and life of the Church, together with everything that was or seemed her inalienable possession,
as, for instance, the Christian interpretation of the Old Testament. In the narrower sense
that canon consisted of the history and words of Jesus. In so far as they formed the content
of faith they were the faith itself, that is, the Christian truth; in so far as this faith
was to determine the essence of everything Christian, it might be termed [Greek: kanôn tês
pisteôs, kanôn tês alêtheias] (canon of the faith, canon of the truth).[23] But the very fact
that the extent of what was regarded as tradition of the Apostles was quite undetermined ensured
the possibility of the highest degree of freedom; it was also still allowable to give expression
to Christian inspiration and to the intuition of enthusiasm without any regard to tradition.

We now know that before the violent conflict with Gnosticism short formulated summaries of
the faith had already grown out of the missionary practice of the Church (catechising). The
shortest formula was that which defined the Christian faith as belief in the Father, Son, and
Spirit.[24] It appears to have been universally current in Christendom about the year 150.
In the solemn transactions of the Church, therefore especially in baptism, in the great prayer
of the Lord's Supper, as well as in the exorcism of demons,[25] fixed formulæ were used. They
embraced also such articles as contained the most important facts in the history of Jesus.[26]
We know definitely that not later than about the middle of the second century (about 140 A.D.)
the Roman Church possessed a fixed creed, which every candidate for baptism had to profess;[27]
and something similar must also have existed in Smyrna and other Churches of Asia Minor about
the year 150, in some cases, even rather earlier. We may suppose that formulæ of similar plan
and extent were also found in other provincial Churches about this time.[28] Still it is neither
probable that all the then existing communities possessed such creeds, nor that those who used
them had formulated them in such a rigid way as the Roman Church had done. The proclamation
of the history of Christ predicted in the Old Testament, the [Greek: kerygma tês alêtheias],
also accompanied the short baptismal formula without being expressed in set terms.[29]

Words of Jesus and, in general, directions for the Christian life were not, as a rule, admitted
into the short formulated creed. In the recently discovered "Teaching of the Apostles" ([Greek:
Didachê tôn apostolôn]) we have no doubt a notable attempt to fix the rules of Christian life
as traced back to Jesus through the medium of the Apostles, and to elevate them into the foundation
of the confederation of Christian Churches; but this undertaking, which could not but have
led the development of Christianity into other paths, did not succeed. That the formulated
creeds did not express the principles of conduct, but the facts on which Christians based their
faith, was an unavoidable necessity. Besides, the universal agreement of all earnest and thoughtful
minds on the question of Christian morals was practically assured.[30] Objection was not taken
to the principles of morality--at least this was not a primary consideration--for there were
many Greeks to whom they did not seem foolishness, but to the adoration of Christ as he was
represented in tradition and to the Church's worship of a God, who, as creator of the world
and as a speaking and visible being, appeared to the Greeks, with their ideas of a purely spiritual
deity, to be interwoven with the world, and who, as the God worshipped by the Jews also, seemed
clearly distinct from the Supreme Being. This gave rise to the mockery of the heathen, the
theological art of the Gnostics, and the radical reconstruction of tradition as attempted by
Marcion. With the freedom that still prevailed Christianity was in danger of being resolved
into a motley mass of philosophic speculations or of being completely detached from its original
conditions. "It was admitted on all sides that Christianity had its starting-point in certain
facts and sayings; but if any and every interpretation of those facts and sayings was possible,
if any system of philosophy might be taught into which the words that expressed them might
be woven, it is clear that there could be but little cohesion between the members of the Christian
communities. The problem arose and pressed for an answer: What should be the basis of Christian
union? But the problem was for a time insoluble. For there was no standard and no court of
appeal." From the very beginning, when the differences in the various Churches began to threaten
their unity, appeal was probably made to the Apostles' doctrine, the words of the Lord, tradition,
"sound doctrine", definite facts, such as the reality of the human nature (flesh) of Christ,
and the reality of his death and resurrection.[31] In instruction, in exhortations, and above
all in opposing erroneous doctrines and moral aberrations, this precept was inculcated from
the beginning: [Greek: apolipômen tas kenas kai mataias phrontidas, kai elthômen epi ton eukleê
kai semnon tês paradoseôs hêmôn kanona] ("Let us leave off vain and foolish thoughts and betake
ourselves to the glorious and august canon of our tradition"). But the very question was: What
is sound doctrine? What is the content of tradition? Was the flesh of Christ a reality? etc.
There is no doubt that Justin, in opposition to those whom he viewed as pseudo-Christians,
insisted on the absolute necessity of acknowledging certain definite traditional facts and
made this recognition the standard of orthodoxy. To all appearance it was he who began the
great literary struggle for the expulsion of heterodoxy (see his [Greek: syntagma kata pasôn
tôn gegenêmenôn haireseôn]); but, judging from those writings of his that have been preserved
to us, it seems very unlikely that he was already successful in finding a fixed standard for
determining orthodox Christianity.[32]

The permanence of the communities, however, depended on the discovery of such a standard. They
were no longer held together by the conscientia religionis, the unitas disciplinæ, and the
foedus spei. The Gnostics were not solely to blame for that. They rather show us merely the
excess of a continuous transformation which no community could escape. The gnosis which subjected
religion to a critical examination awoke in proportion as religious life from generation to
generation lost its warmth and spontaneity. There was a time when the majority of Christians
knew themselves to be such, (1) because they had the "Spirit" and found in that an indestructible
guarantee of their Christian position, (2) because they observed all the commandments of Jesus
([Greek: entolai Iêsou]). But when these guarantees died away, and when at the same time the
most diverse doctrines that were threatening to break up the Church were preached in the name
of Christianity, the fixing of tradition necessarily became the supreme task. Here, as in every
other case, the tradition was not fixed till after it had been to some extent departed from.
It was just the Gnostics themselves who took the lead in a fixing process, a plain proof that
the setting up of dogmatic formulæ has always been the support of new formations. But the example
set by the Gnostics was the very thing that rendered the problem difficult. Where was a beginning
to be made? "There is a kind of unconscious logic in the minds of masses of men when great
questions are abroad, which some one thinker throws into suitable form."[33] There could be
no doubt that the needful thing was to fix what was "apostolic," for the one certain thing
was that Christianity was based on a divine revelation which had been transmitted through the
medium of the Apostles to the Churches of the whole earth. It certainly was not a single individual
who hit on the expedient of affirming the fixed forms employed by the Churches in their solemn
transactions to be apostolic in the strict sense. It must have come about by a natural process.
But the confession of the Father, Son, and Spirit and the kerygma of Jesus Christ had the most
prominent place among these forms. The special emphasising of these articles, in opposition
to the Gnostic and Marcionite undertakings, may also be viewed as the result of the "common
sense" of all those who clung to the belief that the Father of Jesus Christ was the creator
of the world, and that the Son of God really appeared in the flesh. But that was not everywhere
sufficient, for, even admitting that about the period between 150 and 180 A.D. all the Churches
had a fixed creed which they regarded as apostolic in the strict sense--and this cannot be
proved,--the most dangerous of all Gnostic schools, viz., those of Valentinus, could recognise
this creed, since they already possessed the art of explaining a given text in whatever way
they chose. What was needed was an apostolic creed definitely interpreted; for it was only
by the aid of a definite interpretation that the creed could be used to repel the Gnostic speculations
and the Marcionite conception of Christianity.

In this state of matters the Church of Rome, the proceedings of which are known to us through
Irenæus and Tertullian, took, with regard to the fixed Roman baptismal confession ascribed
to the Apostles, the following step: The Antignostic interpretation required by the necessities
of the times was proclaimed as its self-evident content; the confession, thus explained, was
designated as the "Catholic faith" ("fides catholica"), that is the rule of truth for the faith;
and its acceptance was made the test of adherence to the Roman Church as well as to the general
confederation of Christendom. Irenæus was not the author of this proceeding. How far Rome acted
with the coöperation or under the influence of the Church of Asia Minor is a matter that is
still obscure,[34] and will probably never be determined with certainty. What the Roman community
accomplished practically was theoretically established by Irenæus[35] and Tertullian. The former
proclaimed the baptismal confession, definitely interpreted and expressed in an Antignostic
form, to be the apostolic rule of truth (regula veritatis), and tried to prove it so. He based
his demonstration on the theory that this series of doctrines embodied the faith of the churches
founded by the Apostles, and that these communities had always preserved the apostolic teaching
unchanged (see under C).

Viewed historically, this thesis, which preserved Christianity from complete dissolution, is
based on two unproved assumptions and on a confusion of ideas. It is not demonstrated that
any creed emanated from the Apostles, nor that the Churches they founded always preserved their
teaching in its original form; the creed itself, moreover, is confused with its interpretation.
Finally, the existence of a fides catholica, in the strict sense of the word, cannot be justly
inferred from the essential agreement found in the doctrine of a series of communities.[36]
But, on the other hand, the course taken by Irenæus was the only one capable of saving what
yet remained of primitive Christianity, and that is its historical justification. A fides apostolica
had to be set up and declared identical with the already existing fides catholica. It had to
be made the standard for judging all particular doctrinal opinions, that it might be determined
whether they were admissible or not.

The persuasive power with which Irenæus set up the principle of the apostolic "rule of truth,"
or of "tradition" or simply of "faith," was undoubtedly, as far as he himself was concerned,
based on the facts that he had already a rigidly formulated creed before him and that he had
no doubt as to its interpretation.[37] The rule of truth (also [Greek: hê hypo tês ekklêsias
kêryssomenê alêtheia] "the truth proclaimed by the Church;" and [Greek: to tês alêtheias sômation],
"the body of the truth") is the old baptismal confession well known to the communities for
which he immediately writes. (See I. 9. 4; [Greek: houtô de kai ho ton kanona tês alêtheias
aklinê en heautô katechôn hon dia tou baptismatos eilêphe], "in like manner he also who retains
immovably in his heart the rule of truth which he received through baptism"); because it is
this, it is apostolic, firm and immovable.[38]

By the fixing of the rule of truth, the formulation of which in the case of Irenæus (I. 10.
1, 2) naturally follows the arrangement of the (Roman) baptismal confession, the most important
Gnostic theses were at once set aside and their antitheses established as apostolic. In his
apostolic rule of truth Irenæus himself already gave prominence to the following doctrines:[39]
the unity of God, the identity of the supreme God with the Creator; the identity of the supreme
God with the God of the Old Testament; the unity of Jesus Christ as the Son of the God who
created the world; the essential divinity of Christ; the incarnation of the Son of God; the
prediction of the entire history of Jesus through the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament; the
reality of that history; the bodily reception ([Greek: ensarkos analêpsis]) of Christ into
heaven; the visible return of Christ; the resurrection of all flesh ([Greek: anastasis pasês
sarkos, pasês anthropôtêtos]), the universal judgment. These dogmas, the antitheses of the
Gnostic regulæ,[40] were consequently, as apostolic and therefore also as Catholic, removed
beyond all discussion.

Tertullian followed Irenæus in every particular. He also interpreted the (Romish) baptismal
confession, represented it, thus explained, as the regula fidei,[41] and transferred to the
latter the attributes of the confession, viz., its apostolic origin (or origin from Christ),
as well as its fixedness and completeness.[42] Like Irenæus, though still more stringently,
he also endeavoured to prove that the formula had descended from Christ, that is, from the
Apostles, and was incorrupt. He based his demonstration on the alleged incontestable facts
that it contained the faith of those Churches founded by the Apostles, that in these communities
a corruption of doctrine was inconceivable, because in them, as could be proved, the Apostles
had always had successors, and that the other Churches were in communion with them (see under
C). In a more definite way than Irenæus, Tertullian conceives the rule of faith as a rule for
the faith,[43] as the law given to faith,[44] also as a "regula doctrinæ" or "doctrina regulæ"
(here the creed itself is quite plainly the regula), and even simply as "doctrina" or "institutio."[45]
As to the content of the regula, it was set forth by Tertullian in three passages.[46] It is
essentially the same as in Irenæus. But Tertullian already gives prominence within the regula
to the creation of the universe out of nothing,[47] the creative instrumentality of the Logos,[48]
his origin before all creatures,[49] a definite theory of the Incarnation,[50] the preaching
by Christ of a nova lex and a nova promissio regni coelorum,[51] and finally also the Trinitarian
economy of God.[52] Materially, therefore, the advance beyond Irenæus is already very significant.
Tertullian's regula is in point of fact a doctrina. In attempting to bind the communities to
this he represents them as schools.[53] The apostolic "lex et doctrina" is to be regarded as
inviolable by every Christian. Assent to it decides the Christian character of the individual.
Thus the Christian disposition and life come to be a matter which is separate from this and
subject to particular conditions. In this way the essence of religion was split up--the most
fatal turning-point in the history of Christianity.

But we are not of course to suppose that at the beginning of the third century the actual bond
of union between all the Churches was a fixed confession developed into a doctrine, that is,
definitely interpreted. This much was gained, as is clear from the treatise de præscriptione
and from other evidence, that in the communities with which Tertullian was acquainted, mutual
recognition and brotherly intercourse were made to depend on assent to formulæ which virtually
coincided with the Roman baptismal confession. Whoever assented to such a formula was regarded
as a Christian brother, and was entitled to the salutation of peace, the name of brother, and
hospitality.[54] In so far as Christians confined themselves to a doctrinal formula which they,
however, strictly applied, the adoption of this practice betokened an advance. The scattered
communities now possessed a "lex" to bind them together, quite as certainly as the philosophic
schools possessed a bond of union of a real and practical character[55] in the shape of certain
briefly formulated doctrines. In virtue of the common apostolic lex of Christians the Catholic
Church became a reality, and was at the same time clearly marked off from the heretic sects.
But more than this was gained, in so far as the Antignostic interpretation of the formula,
and consequently a "doctrine," was indeed in some measure involved in the lex. The extent to
which this was the case depended, of course, on the individual community or its leaders. All
Gnostics could not be excluded by the wording of the confession; and, on the other hand, every
formulated faith leads to a formulated doctrine, as soon as it is set up as a critical canon.
What we observe in Irenæus and Tertullian must have everywhere taken place in a greater or
less degree; that is to say, the authority of the confessional formula must have been extended
to statements not found in the formula itself.

We can still prove from the works of Clement of Alexandria that a confession claiming to be
an apostolic law of faith,[56] ostensibly comprehending the whole essence of Christianity,
was not set up in the different provincial Churches at one and the same time. From this it
is clearly manifest that at this period the Alexandrian Church neither possessed a baptismal
confession similar to that of Rome,[57] nor understood by "regula fidei" and synonymous expressions
a collection of beliefs fixed in some fashion and derived from the apostles.[58] Clement of
Alexandria in his Stromateis appeals to the holy (divine) Scriptures, to the teaching of the
Lord,[59] and to the standard tradition which he designates by a great variety of names, though
he never gives its content, because he regards the whole of Christianity in its present condition
as needing to be reconstructed by gnosis, and therefore as coming under the head of tradition.[60]
In one respect therefore, as compared with Irenæus and Tertullian, he to some extent represents
an earlier standpoint; he stands midway between them and Justin. From this author he is chiefly
distinguished by the fact that he employs sacred Christian writings as well as the Old Testament,
makes the true Gnostic quite as dependent on the former as on the latter and has lost that
naive view of tradition, that is, the complete content of Christianity, which Irenæus and Tertullian
still had. As is to be expected, Clement too assigns the ultimate authorship of the tradition
to the Apostles; but it is characteristic that he neither does this of such set purpose as
Irenæus and Tertullian, nor thinks it necessary to prove that the Church had presented the
apostolic tradition intact. But as he did not extract from the tradition a fixed complex of
fundamental propositions, so also he failed to recognise the importance of its publicity and
catholicity, and rather placed an esoteric alongside of an exoteric tradition. Although, like
Irenæus and Tertullian, his attitude is throughout determined by opposition to the Gnostics
and Marcion, he supposes it possible to refute them by giving to the Holy Scriptures a scientific
exposition which must not oppose the [Greek: kanôn tês ekklêsias], that is, the Christian common
sense, but receives from it only certain guiding rules. But this attitude of Clement would
be simply inconceivable if the Alexandrian Church of his time had already employed the fixed
standard applied in those of Rome, Carthage and Lyons.[61] Such a standard did not exist; but
Clement made no distinction in the yet unsystematised tradition, even between faith and discipline,
because as a theologian he was not able to identify himself with any single article of it without
hesitation, and because he ascribed to the true Gnostic the ability to fix and guarantee the
truth of Christian doctrine.

Origen, although he also attempted to refute the heretics chiefly by a scientific exegesis
of the Holy Scriptures, exhibits an attitude which is already more akin to that of Irenæus
and Tertullian than to that of Clement. In the preface to his great work, "De principiis,"
he prefixed the Church doctrine as a detailed apostolic rule of faith, and in other instances
also he appealed to the apostolic teaching.[62] It may be assumed that in the time of Caracalla
and Heliogabalus the Alexandrian Christians had also begun to adopt the principles acted upon
in Rome and other communities.[63] The Syrian Churches, or at least a part of them, followed
still later.[64] There can be no doubt that, from the last decades of the third century onward,
one and the same confession, identical not in its wording, but in its main features, prevailed
in the great confederation of Churches extending from Spain to the Euphrates and from Egypt
to beyond the Alps.[65] It was the basis of the confederation, and therefore also a passport,
mark of recognition, etc., for the orthodox Christians. The interpretation of this confession
was fixed in certain ground features, that is, in an Antignostic sense. But a definite theological
interpretation was also more and more enforced. By the end of the third century there can no
longer have been any considerable number of outlying communities where the doctrines of the
pre-existence of Christ and the identity of this pre-existent One with the divine Logos were
not recognised as the orthodox belief.[66] They may have first become an "apostolic confession
of faith" through the Nicene Creed. But even this creed was not adopted all at once. (Didache
IV. 1; see also 1 Cor. XII. 3). Hence the contents were holy.[68] In this sense the New Testament
is a "residuary product," just as the idea of its inspiration is a remnant of a much broader
view. But on the other hand, the New Testament is a new creation of the Church,[69] inasmuch
as it takes its place alongside of the Old--which through it has become a complicated book
for Christendom,--as a Catholic and apostolic collection of Scriptures containing and attesting
the truth.

Marcion had founded his conception of Christianity on a new canon of Scripture,[70] which seems
to have enjoyed the same authority among his followers as was ascribed to the Old Testament
in orthodox Christendom. In the Gnostic schools, which likewise rejected the Old Testament
altogether or in part, Evangelic and Pauline writings were, by the middle of the second century,
treated as sacred texts and made use of to confirm their theological speculations.[71] On the
other hand, about the year 150 the main body of Christendom had still no collection of Gospels
and Epistles possessing equal authority with the Old Testament, and, apart from Apocalypses,
no new writings at all, which as such, that is, as sacred texts, were regarded as inspired
and authoritative.[72] Here we leave out of consideration that their content is a testimony
of the Spirit. From the works of Justin it is to be inferred that the ultimate authorities
were the Old Testament, the words of the Lord, and the communications of Christian prophets.[73]
The memoirs of the Apostles ([Greek: apomnêmoneumata ton apostolôn] = [Greek: ta euangelia])
owed their significance solely to the fact that they recorded the words and history of the
Lord and bore witness to the fulfilment of Old Testament predictions. There is no mention whatever
of apostolic epistles as holy writings of standard authority.[74] But we learn further from
Justin that the Gospels as well as the Old Testament were read in public worship (Apol. I.
67) and that our first three Gospels were already in use. We can, moreover, gather from other
sources that other Christian writings, early and late, were more or less regularly read in
Christian meetings.[75] Such writings naturally possessed a high degree of authority. As the
Holy Spirit and the Church are inseparable, everything that edifies the Church originates with
the Holy Spirit,[76] which in this, as well as every other respect, is inexhaustibly rich.
Here, however, two interests were predominant from the beginning, that of immediate spiritual
edification and that of attesting and certifying the Christian Kerygma ([Greek: hê asphaleia
tôn logôn]). The ecclesiastical canon was the result of the latter interest, not indeed in
consequence of a process of collection, for individual communities had already made a far larger
compilation,[77] but, in the first instance, through selection, and afterwards, but not till
then, through addition.

We must not think that the four Gospels now found in the canon had attained full canonical
authority by the middle of the second century, for the fact--easily demonstrable--that the
texts were still very freely dealt with about this period is in itself a proof of this.[78]
Our first three Gospels contain passages and corrections that could hardly have been fixed
before about the year 150. Moreover, Tatian's attempt to create a new Gospel from the four
shews that the text of these was not yet fixed.[79] We may remark that he was the first in
whom we find the Gospel of John[80] alongside of the Synoptists, and these four the only ones
recognised. From the assault of the "Alogi" on the Johannine Gospel we learn that about 160
the whole of our four Gospels had not been definitely recognised even in Asia Minor. Finally,
we must refer to the Gospel of the Egyptians, the use of which was not confined to circles
outside the Church.[81]

From the middle of the second century the Encratites stood midway between the larger Christendom
and the Marcionite Church as well as the Gnostic schools. We hear of some of these using the
Gospels as canonical writings side by side with the Old Testament, though they would have nothing
to do with the Epistles of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles.[82] But Tatian, the prominent
Apologist, who joined them, gave this sect a more complete canon, an important fact about which
was its inclusion of Epistles of Paul. Even this period, however, still supplies us with no
testimony as to the existence of a New Testament canon in orthodox Christendom, in fact the
rise of the so-called "Montanism" and its extreme antithesis, the "Alogi," in Asia Minor soon
after the middle of the second century proves that there was still no New Testament canon there;
for, if such an authoritative compilation had existed, these movements could not have arisen.
If we gather together all the indications and evidence bearing on the subject, we shall indeed
be ready to expect the speedy appearance in the Church of a kind of Gospel canon comprising
the four Gospels;[83] but we are prepared neither for this being formally placed on an equality
with the Old Testament, nor for its containing apostolic writings, which as yet are only found
in Marcion and the Gnostics. The canon emerges quite suddenly in an allusion of Melito of Sardis
preserved by Eusebius,[84] the meaning of which is, however, still dubious; in the works of
Irenæus and Tertullian; and in the so-called Muratorian Fragment. There is no direct account
of its origin and scarcely any indirect; yet it already appears as something to all intents
and purposes finished and complete.[85] Moreover, it emerges in the same ecclesiastical district
where we were first able to show the existence of the apostolic regula fidei. We hear nothing
of any authority belonging to the compilers, because we learn nothing at all of such persons.[86]
And yet the collection is regarded by Irenæus and Tertullian as completed. A refusal on the
part of the heretics to recognise this or that book is already made a severe reproach against
them. Their Bibles are tested by the Church compilation as the older one, and the latter itself
is already used exactly like the Old Testament. The assumption of the inspiration of the books;
the harmonistic interpretation of them; the idea of their absolute sufficiency with regard
to every question which can arise and every event which they record; the right of unlimited
combination of passages; the assumption that nothing in the Scriptures is without importance;
and, finally, the allegorical interpretation: are the immediately observable result of the
creation of the canon.[87]

The probable conditions which brought about the formation of the New Testament canon in the
Church, for in this case we are only dealing with probabilities, and the interests which led
to and remained associated with it can only be briefly indicated here.[88]

The compilation and formation of a canon of Christian writings by a process of selection[89]
was, so to speak, a kind of involuntary undertaking of the Church in her conflict with Marcion
and the Gnostics, as is most plainly proved by the warnings of the Fathers not to dispute with
the heretics about the Holy Scriptures,[90] although the New Testament was already in existence.
That conflict necessitated the formation of a new Bible. The exclusion of particular persons
on the strength of some apostolic standards, and by reference to the Old Testament, could not
be justified by the Church in her own eyes and those of her opponents, so long as she herself
recognised that there were apostolic writings, and so long as these heretics appealed to such.
She was compelled to claim exclusive possession of everything that had a right to the name
"apostolic," to deny it to the heretics, and to shew that she held it in the highest honour.
Hitherto she had "contented" herself with proving her legal title from the Old Testament, and,
passing over her actual origin, had dated herself back to the beginning of all things. Marcion
and the Gnostics were the first who energetically pointed out that Christianity began with
Christ, and that all Christianity was really to be tested by the apostolic preaching, that
the assumed identity of Christian common sense with apostolic Christianity did not exist, and
(so Marcion said) that the Apostles contradicted themselves. This opposition made it necessary
to enter into the questions raised by their opponents. But, in point of content, the problem
of proving the contested identity was simply insoluble, because it was endless and subject
to question on every particular point. The "unconscious logic," that is the logic of self-preservation,
could only prescribe an expedient. The Church had to collect everything apostolic and declare
herself to be its only legal possessor. She was obliged, moreover, to amalgamate the apostolic
with the canon of the Old Testament in such a way as to fix the exposition from the very first.
But what writings were apostolic? From the middle of the second century great numbers of writings
named after the Apostles had already been in circulation, and there were often different recensions
of one and the same writing.[91] Versions which contained docetic elements and exhortations
to the most pronounced asceticism had even made their way into the public worship of the Church.
Above all, therefore, it was necessary to determine (1) what writings were really apostolic,
(2) what form or recension should be regarded as apostolic. The selection was made by the Church,
that is, primarily, by the churches of Rome and Asia Minor, which had still an unbroken history
up to the days of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. In making this choice, the Church limited herself
to the writings that were used in public worship, and only admitted what the tradition of the
elders justified her in regarding as genuinely apostolic. The principle on which she proceeded
was to reject as spurious all writings, bearing the names of Apostles, that contained anything
contradictory to Christian common sense, that is, to the rule of faith--hence admission was
refused to all books in which the God of the Old Testament, his creation, etc., appeared to
be depreciated,--and to exclude all recensions of apostolic writings that seemed to endanger
the Old Testament and the monarchy of God. She retained, therefore, only those writings which
bore the names of Apostles, or anonymous writings to which she considered herself justified
in attaching such names,[92] and whose contents were not at variance with the orthodox creed
or attested it. This selection resulted in the awkward fact that besides the four Gospels there
was almost nothing but Pauline epistles to dispose of, and therefore no writings or almost
none which, as emanating from the twelve Apostles, could immediately confirm the truth of the
ecclesiastical Kerygma. This perplexity was removed by the introduction of the Acts of the
Apostles[93] and in some cases also the Epistles of Peter and John, though that of Peter was
not recognised at Rome at first. As a collection this group is the most interesting in the
new compilation. It gives it the stamp of Catholicity, unites the Gospels with the Apostle
(Paul), and, by subordinating his Epistles to the "Acta omnium apostolorum," makes them witnesses
to the particular tradition that was required and divests them of every thing suspicious and
insufficient.[94] The Church, however, found the selection facilitated by the fact that the
content of the early Christian writings was for the most part unintelligible to the Christendom
of the time, whereas the late and spurious additions were betrayed not only by heretical theologoumena,
but also and above all by their profane lucidity. Thus arose a collection of apostolic writings,
which in extent may not have been strikingly distinguished from the list of writings that for
more than a generation had formed the chief and favourite reading in the communities.[95] The
new collection was already exalted to a high place by the use of other writings being prohibited
either for purposes of general edification or for theological ends.[96] But the causes and
motives which led to its being formed into a canon, that is, being placed on a footing of complete
equality with the Old Testament, may be gathered partly from the earlier history, partly from
the mode of using the new Bible and partly from the results attending its compilation. First,
Words of the Lord and prophetic utterances, including the written records of these, had always
possessed standard authority in the Church; there were therefore parts of the collection the
absolute authority of which was undoubted from the first.[97] Secondly, what was called "Preaching
of the Apostles," "Teaching of the Apostles," etc., was likewise regarded from the earliest
times as completely harmonious as well as authoritative. There had, however, been absolutely
no motive for fixing this in documents, because Christians supposed they possessed it in a
state of purity and reproduced it freely. The moment the Church was called upon to fix this
teaching authentically, and this denotes a decisive revolution, she was forced to have recourse
to writings, whether she would or not. The attributes formerly applied to the testimony of
the Apostles, so long as it was not collected and committed to writing, had now to be transferred
to the written records they had left. Thirdly, Marcion had already taken the lead in forming
Christian writings into a canon in the strict sense of the word. Fourthly, the interpretation
was at once fixed by forming the apostolic writings into a canon, and placing them on an equality
with the Old Testament, as well as by subordinating troublesome writings to the Acts of the
Apostles. Considered by themselves these writings, especially the Pauline Epistles, presented
the greatest difficulties. We can see even yet from Irenæus and Tertullian that the duty of
accommodating herself to these Epistles was forced upon the Church by Marcion and the heretics,
and that, but for this constraint, her method of satisfying herself as to her relationship
to them would hardly have taken the shape of incorporating them with the canon.[98] This shows
most clearly that the collection of writings must not be traced to the Church's effort to create
for herself a powerful controversial weapon. But the difficulties which the compilation presented
so long as it was a mere collection vanished as soon as it was viewed as a sacred collection.
For now the principle: "as the teaching of the Apostles was one, so also is the tradition"
([Greek: mia hê pantôn gegone tôn apostolôn hôsper didaskalia houtôs de kai hê paradosis])
was to be applied to all contradictory and objectionable details.[99] It was now imperative
to explain one writing by another; the Pauline Epistles, for example, were to be interpreted
by the Pastoral Epistles and the Acts of the Apostles.[100] Now was required what Tertullian
calls the "mixture" of the Old and New Testaments,[101] in consequence of which the full recognition
of the knowledge got from the old Bible was regarded as the first law for the interpretation
of the new. The formation of the new collection into a canon was therefore an immediate and
unavoidable necessity if doubts of all kinds were to be averted. These were abundantly excited
by the exegesis of the heretics; they were got rid of by making the writings into a canon.
Fifthly, the early Christian enthusiasm more and more decreased in the course of the second
century; not only did Apostles, prophets, and teachers die out, but the religious mood of the
majority of Christians was changed. A reflective piety took the place of the instinctive religious
enthusiasm which made those who felt it believe that they themselves possessed the Spirit.[102]
Such a piety requires rules; at the same time, however, it is characterised by the perception
that it has not the active and spontaneous character which it ought to have, but has to prove
its legitimacy in an indirect and "objective" way. The breach with tradition, the deviation
from the original state of things is felt and recognised. Men, however, conceal from themselves
their own defects, by placing the representatives of the past on an unattainable height, and
forming such an estimate of their qualities as makes it unlawful and impossible for those of
the present generation, in the interests of their own comfort, to compare themselves with them.
When matters reach this point, great suspicion attaches to those who hold fast their religious
independence and wish to apply the old standards. Not only do they seem arrogant and proud,
but they also appear disturbers of the necessary new arrangement which has its justification
in the fact of its being unavoidable. This development of the matter was, moreover, of the
greatest significance for the history of the canon. Its creation very speedily resulted in
the opinion that the time of divine revelation had gone past and was exhausted in the Apostles,
that is, in the records left by them. We cannot prove with certainty that the canon was formed
to confirm this opinion, but we can show that it was very soon used to oppose those Christians
who professed to be prophets or appealed to the continuance of prophecy. The influence which
the canon exercised in this respect is the most decisive and important. That which Tertullian,
as a Montanist, asserts of one of his opponents: "Prophetiam expulit, paracletum fugavit" ("he
expelled prophecy, he drove away the Paraclete"), can be far more truly said of the New Testament
which the same Tertullian as a Catholic recognised. The New Testament, though not all at once,
put an end to a situation where it was possible for any Christian under the inspiration of
the Spirit to give authoritative disclosures and instructions. It likewise prevented belief
in the fanciful creations with which such men enriched the history of the past, and destroyed
their pretensions to read the future. As the creation of the canon, though not in a hard and
fast way, fixed the period of the production of sacred facts, so it put down all claims of
Christian prophecy to public credence. Through the canon it came to be acknowledged that all
post-apostolic Christianity is only of a mediate and particular kind, and can therefore never
be itself a standard. The Apostles alone possessed the Spirit of God completely and without
measure. They only, therefore, are the media of revelation, and by their word alone, which,
as emanating from the Spirit, is of equal authority with the word of Christ, all that is Christian
must be tested.[103]

The Holy Spirit and the Apostles became correlative conceptions (Tertull., de pudic. 21). The
Apostles, however, were more and more overshadowed by the New Testament Scriptures; and this
was in fact an advance beyond the earlier state of things, for what was known of the Apostles?
Accordingly, as authors of these writings, they and the Holy Spirit became correlative conceptions.
This led to the assumption that the apostolic writings were inspired, that is, in the full
and only intelligible sense attached to the word by the ancients.[104] By this assumption the
Apostles, viewed as prophets, received a significance quite equal to that of Old Testament
writers.[105] But, though Irenæus and Tertullian placed both parties on a level, they preserved
a distinction between them by basing the whole authority of the New Testament on its apostolic
origin, the concept "apostolic" being much more comprehensive than that of "prophet." These
men, being Apostles, that is men chosen by Christ himself and entrusted with the proclamation
of the Gospel, have for that reason received the Spirit, and their writings are filled with
the Spirit. To the minds of Western Christians the primary feature in the collection is its
apostolic authorship.[106] This implies inspiration also, because the Apostles cannot be inferior
to the writers of the Old Testament. For that very reason they could, in a much more radical
way, rid the new collection of everything that was not apostolic. They even rejected writings
which, in their form, plainly claimed the character of inspiration; and this was evidently
done because they did not attribute to them the degree of authority which, in their view, only
belonged to that which was apostolic.[107] The new canon of Scripture set up by Irenæus and
Tertullian primarily professes to be nothing else than a collection of apostolic writings,
which, as such, claim absolute authority.[108] It takes its place beside the apostolic rule
of faith; and by this faithfully preserved possession, the Church scattered over the world
proves herself to be that of the Apostles.

But we are very far from being able to show that such a rigidly fixed collection of apostolic
writings existed everywhere in the Church about the year 200. It is indeed continually asserted
that the Antiochian and Alexandrian Churches had at that date a New Testament which, in extent
and authority, essentially coincided with that of the Roman Church; but this opinion is not
well founded. As far as the Church of Antioch is immediately concerned, the letter of Bishop
Serapion (whose episcopate lasted from about 190 to about 209), given in Eusebius (VI. 12),
clearly shows that Cilicia and probably also Antioch itself as yet possessed no such thing
as a completed New Testament. It is evident that Serapion already holds the Catholic principle
that all words of Apostles possess the same value to the Church as words of the Lord; but a
completed collection of apostolic writings was not yet at his disposal.[109] Hence it is very
improbable that Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, who died as early as the reign of Commodus,
presupposed such a collection. Nor, in point of fact, do the statements in the treatise "ad
Autolycum" point to a completed New Testament.[110] Theophilus makes diligent use of the Epistles
of Paul and mentions the evangelist John (C. I. 1.) as one of the bearers of the Spirit. But
with him the one canonical court of appeal is the Scriptures of the Old Testament, that is,
the writings of the Prophets (bearers of the Spirit). These Old Testament Prophets, however,
are continued in a further group of "bearers of the Spirit," which we cannot definitely determine,
but which at any rate included the authors of the four Gospels and the writer of the Apocalypse.
It is remarkable that Theophilus has never mentioned the Apostles. Though he perhaps regards
them all, including Paul, as "bearers of the Spirit," yet we have no indication that he looked
on their Epistles as canonical. The different way he uses the Old Testament and the Gospels
on the one hand and the Pauline Epistles on the other is rather evidence of the contrary. Theophilus
was acquainted with the four Gospels (but we have no reference to Mark), the thirteen Epistles
of Paul (though he does not mention Thessalonians), most probably also with the Epistle to
the Hebrews, as well as 1st Peter and the Revelation of John. It is significant that no single
passage of his betrays an acquaintance with the Acts of the Apostles.[111]

It might certainly seem venturesome, on the basis of the material found in Theophilus and the
original document of the first six books of the Apostolic Constitutions, to conclude that the
formation of a New Testament canon was not everywhere determined by the same interest and therefore
did not everywhere take a similar course. It might seem hazardous to assume that the Churches
of Asia Minor and Rome began by creating a fixed canon of apostolic writings, which was thus
necessarily declared to be inspired, whereas other communities applied or did not deny the
notion of inspiration to a great number of venerable and ancient writings not rigidly defined,
and did not make a selection from a stricter historical point of view, till a later date. But
the latter development not only corresponds to the indication found in Justin, but in my opinion
may be verified from the copious accounts of Clement of Alexandria.[112] In the entire literature
of Greeks and barbarians Clement distinguishes between profane and sacred, i.e., inspired writings.
As he is conscious that all knowledge of truth is based on inspiration, so all writings, that
is all parts, paragraphs, or sentences of writings which contain moral and religious truth
are in his view inspired.[113] This opinion, however, does not exclude a distinction between
these writings, but rather requires it. (2) The Old Testament, a fixed collection of books,
is regarded by Clement, as a whole and in all its parts, as the divine, that is, inspired book
par excellence. (3) As Clement in theory distinguishes a new covenant from the old, so also
he distinguishes the books of the new covenant from those of the old. (4) These books to which
he applies the formula "Gospel" ([Greek: to euangelion]) and "Apostles" ([Greek: hoi apostoloi])
are likewise viewed by him as inspired, but he does not consider them as forming a fixed collection.
(5) Unless all appearances are deceptive, it was, strictly speaking, only the four Gospels
that he considered and treated as completely on a level with the Old Testament. The formula:
[Greek: ho nomos kai hoi prophêtai kai to euangelion] ("the Law and the Prophets and the Gospel")
is frequently found, and everything else, even the apostolic writings, is judged by this group.[114]
He does not consider even the Pauline Epistles to be a court of appeal of equal value with
the Gospels, though he occasionally describes them as [Greek: graphai].[115] A further class
of writings stands a stage lower than the Pauline Epistles, viz., the Epistles of Clement and
Barnabas, the Shepherd of Hermas, etc. It would be wrong to say that Clement views this group
as an appendix to the New Testament, or as in any sense Antilegomena. This would imply that
he assumed the existence of a fixed collection whose parts he considered of equal value, an
assumption which cannot be proved.[116] (6) As to certain books, such as the "Teaching of the
Apostles," the "Kerygma of Peter," etc., it remains quite doubtful what authority Clement attributed
to them.[117] He quotes the [Greek: Didachê] as [Greek: graphê]. (7) In determining and estimating
the sacred books of the New Testament Clement is manifestly influenced by an ecclesiastical
tradition, for he recognises four Gospels and no more because that was the exact number handed
down. This tradition had already applied the name "apostolic" to most Christian writings which
were to be considered as [Greek: graphai], but it had given the concept "apostolic" a far wider
content than Irenæus and Tertullian,[118] although it had not been able to include all the
new writings which were regarded as sacred under this idea. (Hermas). At the time Clement wrote,
the Alexandrian Church can neither have held the principle that all writings of the Apostles
must be read in the Church and form a decisive court of appeal like the Old Testament, nor
have believed that nothing but the Apostolic--using this word also in its wider sense--has
any claim to authority among Christians. We willingly admit the great degree of freedom and
peculiarity characteristic of Clement, and freely acknowledge the serious difficulties inseparable
from the attempt to ascertain from his writings what was regarded as possessing standard authority
in the Church. Nevertheless it may be assumed with certainty that, at the time this author
wrote, the content of the New Testament canon, or, to speak more correctly, its reception in
the Church and exact attributes had not yet been finally settled in Alexandria.

The condition of the Alexandrian Church of the time may perhaps be described as follows: Ecclesiastical
custom had attributed an authority to a great number of early Christian writings without strictly
defining the nature of this authority or making it equal to that of the Old Testament. Whatever
professed to be inspired, or apostolic, or ancient, or edifying was regarded as the work of
the Spirit and therefore as the Word of God. The prestige of these writings increased in proportion
as Christians became more incapable of producing the like themselves. Not long before Clement
wrote, however, a systematic arrangement of writings embodying the early Christian tradition
had been made in Alexandria also. But, while in the regions represented by Irenæus and Tertullian
the canon must have arisen and been adopted all at once, so to speak, it was a slow process
that led to this result in Alexandria. Here also the principle of apostolicity seems to have
been of great importance for the collectors and editors, but it was otherwise applied than
at Rome. A conservative proceeding was adopted, as they wished to insure as far as possible
the permanence of ancient Christian writings regarded as inspired. In other words, they sought,
wherever practicable, to proclaim all these writings to be apostolic by giving a wider meaning
to the designation and ascribing an imaginary apostolic origin to many of them. This explains
their judgment as to the Epistle to the Hebrews, and how Barnabas and Clement were described
by them as Apostles.[119] Had this undertaking succeeded in the Church, a much more extensive
canon would have resulted than in the West. But it is more than questionable whether it was
really the intention of those first Alexandrian collectors to place the great compilation thus
produced, as a New Testament, side by side with the Old, or, whether their undertaking was
immediately approved in this sense by the Church. In view of the difference of Clement's attitude
to the various groups within this collection of [Greek: graphai], we may assert that in the
Alexandrian Church of that time Gospels and Apostles were indeed ranked with the Law and the
Prophets, but that this position of equality with the Old Testament was not assigned to all
the writings that were prized either on the score of inspiration or of apostolic authority.
The reason of this was that the great collection of early Christian literature that was inspired
and declared to be apostolic could hardly have been used so much in public worship as the Old
Testament and the Gospels.

Be this as it may, if we understand by the New Testament a fixed collection, equally authoritative
throughout, of all the writings that were regarded as genuinely apostolic, that is, those of
the original Apostles and Paul, then the Alexandrian Church at the time of Clement did not
yet possess such a book; but the process which led to it had begun. She had come much nearer
this goal by the time of Origen. At that period the writings included in the New Testament
of the West were all regarded in Alexandria as equally authoritative, and also stood in every
respect on a level with the Old Testament. The principle of apostolicity was more strictly
conceived and more surely applied. Accordingly the extent of "Holy Scripture" was already limited
in the days of Origen. Yet we have to thank the Alexandrian Church for giving us the seven
Catholic Epistles. But, measured by the canon of the Western Church, which must have had a
share in the matter, this sifting process was by no means complete. The inventive minds of
scholars designated a group of writings in the Alexandrian canon as "Antilegomena." The historian
of dogma can take no great interest in the succeeding development, which first led to the canon
being everywhere finally fixed, so far as we can say that this was ever the case. For the still
unsettled dispute as to the extent of the canon did not essentially affect its use and authority,
and in the following period the continuous efforts to establish a harmonious and strictly fixed
canon were solely determined by a regard to tradition. The results are no doubt of great importance
to Church history, because they show us the varying influence exerted on Christendom at different
periods by the great Churches of the East and West and by their learned men.

Addendum.--The results arising from the formation of a part of early Christian writings into
a canon, which was a great and meritorious act of the Church[120], notwithstanding the fact
that it was forced on her by a combination of circumstances, may be summed up in a series of
antitheses. (1) The New Testament, or group of "apostolic" writings formed by selection, preserved
from destruction one part, and undoubtedly the most valuable one, of primitive Church literature;
but it caused all the rest of these writings, as being intrusive, or spurious, or superfluous,
to be more and more neglected, so that they ultimately perished.[121] (2) The New Testament,
though not all at once, put an end to the composition of works which claimed an authority binding
on Christendom (inspiration); but it first made possible the production of secular Church literature
and neutralised the extreme dangers attendant on writings of this kind. By making room for
all kinds of writings that did not oppose it, it enabled the Church to utilise all the elements
of Greek culture. At the same time, however, it required an ecclesiastical stamp to be placed
on all the new Christian productions due to this cause.[122] (3) The New Testament obscured
the historical meaning and the historical origin of the writing contained in it, especially
the Pauline Epistles, though at the same time it created the conditions for a thorough study
of all those documents. Although primarily the new science of theological exegesis in the Church
did more than anything else to neutralise the historical value of the New Testament writings,
yet, on the other hand, it immediately commenced a critical restoration of their original sense.
But, even apart from theological science, the New Testament enabled original Christianity to
exercise here and there a quiet and gradual effect on the doctrinal development of the Church,
without indeed being able to exert a dominant influence on the natural development of the traditional
system. As the standard of interpretation for the Holy Scriptures was the apostolic regula
fidei, always more and more precisely explained, and as that regula, in its Antignostic and
philosophico-theological interpretation, was regarded as apostolic, the New Testament was explained
in accordance with the conception of Christianity that had become prevalent in the Church.
At first therefore the spirit of the New Testament could only assert itself in certain undercurrents
and in the recognition of particular truths. But the book did not in the least ward off the
danger of a total secularising of Christianity. (4) The New Testament opposed a barrier to
the enthusiastic manufacture of "facts." But at the same time its claim to be a collection
of inspired writings[123] naturally resulted in principles of interpretation (such as the principle
of unanimity, of unlimited combination, of absolute clearness and sufficiency, and of allegorism)
which were necessarily followed by the manufacture of new facts on the part of theological
experts. (5) The New Testament fixed a time within which divine revelation ceased, and prevented
any Christian from putting himself into comparison with the disciples of Jesus. By doing so
it directly promoted the lowering of Christian ideals and requirements, and in a certain fashion
legitimised this weakening of religious power. At the same time, however, it maintained the
knowledge of these ideals and requirements, became a spur to the conscience of believers, and
averted the danger of Christianity being corrupted by the excesses of enthusiasm. (6) The fact
of the New Testament being placed on a level with the Old proved the most effective means of
preserving to the latter its canonical authority, which had been so often assailed in the second
century. But at the same time it brought about an examination of the relation between the Old
and New Testaments, which, however, also involved an enquiry into the connection between Christianity
and pre-christian revelation. The immediate result of this investigation was not only a theological
exposition of the Old Testament, but also a theory which ceased to view the two Testaments
as of equal authority and subordinated the Old to the New. This result, which can be plainly
seen in Irenæus, Tertullian, and Origen, led to exceedingly important consequences.[124] It
gave some degree of insight into statements, hitherto completely unintelligible, in certain
New Testament writings, and it caused the Church to reflect upon a question that had as yet
been raised only by heretics, viz., what are the marks which distinguish Christianity from
the Old Testament religion? An historical examination imperceptibly arose; but the old notion
of the inspiration of the Old Testament confined it to the narrowest limits, and in fact always
continued to forbid it; for, as before, appeal was constantly made to the Old Testament as
a Christian book which contained all the truths of religion in a perfect form. Nevertheless
the conception of the Old Testament was here and there full of contradictions.[125] (7) The
fatal identification of words of the Lord and words of the Apostles (apostolical tradition)
had existed before the creation of the New Testament, though this proceeding gave it a new
range and content and a new significance. But, with the Epistles of Paul included, the New
Testament elevated the highest expression of the consciousness of redemption into a guiding
principle, and by admitting Paulinism into the canon it introduced a wholesome ferment into
the history of the Church. (8) By creating the New Testament and claiming exclusive possession
of it the Church deprived the non-Catholic communions of every apostolic foundation, just as
she had divested Judaism of every legal title by taking possession of the Old Testament; but,
by raising the New Testament to standard authority, she created the armoury which supplied
the succeeding period with the keenest weapons against herself.[126] The place of the Gospel
was taken by a book with exceedingly varied contents, which theoretically acquired the same
authority as the Gospel. Still, the Catholic Church never became a religion "of the book,"
because every inconvenient text could be explained away by the allegoric method, and because
the book was not made use of as the immediate authority for the guidance of Christians, this
latter function being directly discharged by the rule of faith.[127] In practice it continued
to be the rule for the New Testament to take a secondary place in apologetic writings and disputes
with heretics.[128] On the other hand it was regarded (1) as the directly authoritative document
for the direction of the Christian life,[129] and (2) as the final court of appeal in all the
conflicts that arose within the sphere of the rule of faith. It was freely applied in the second
stage of the Montanist struggle, but still more in the controversies about Christology, that
is, in the conflict with the Monarchians. The apostolic writings belong solely to the Church,
because she alone has preserved the apostolic doctrine (regula). This was declared to the heretics
and therewith all controversy about Scripture, or the sense of Scripture passages, was in principle
declined. But within the Church herself the Holy Scripture was regarded as the supreme and
completely independent tribunal against which not even an old tradition could be appealed to;
and the rule [Greek: politeuesthai kata to euangelion] ("live according to the Gospel") held
good in every respect. Moreover, this formula, which is rarely replaced by the other one, viz.,
[Greek: kata tên kainên diathêkên] ("according to the New Testament"), shows that the words
of the Lord, as in the earlier period, continued to be the chief standard of life and conduct.
It was not sufficient to prove that the rule of faith was of apostolic origin, i.e., that the
Apostles had set up a rule of faith. It had further to be shown that, up to the present, the
Church had always maintained it unchanged. This demonstration was all the more necessary because
the heretics also claimed an apostolic origin for their regulæ, and in different ways tried
to adduce proof that they alone possessed a guarantee of inheriting the Apostles' doctrine
in all its purity.[131] An historical demonstration was first attempted by the earliest of
the old Catholic Fathers. They pointed to communities of whose apostolic origin there could
be no doubt, and thought it could not reasonably be denied that those Churches must have preserved
apostolic Christianity in a pure and incorrupt form. The proof that the Church had always held
fast by apostolic Christianity depended on the agreement in doctrine between the other communities
and these.[132] But Irenæus as well as Tertullian felt that a special demonstration was needed
to show that the Churches founded by the Apostles had really at all times faithfully preserved
their genuine teaching. General considerations, as, for instance, the notion that Christianity
would otherwise have temporarily perished, or "that one event among many is as good as none;
but when one and the same feature is found among many, it is not an aberration but a tradition"
But the dogmatic conception that the ecclesiæ (or ecclesia) are the abode of the Holy Spirit,[133]
was incapable of making any impression on the heretics, as the correct application of this
theory was the very point in question. To make their proof more precise Tertullian and Irenæus
therefore asserted that the Churches guaranteed the incorruptness of the apostolic inheritance,
inasmuch as they could point to a chain of "elders," or, in other words, an "ordo episcoporum
per successionem ab initio decurrens," which was a pledge that nothing false had been mixed
up with it.[134] This thesis has quite as many aspects as the conception of the "Elders," e.g.,
disciples of the Apostles, disciples of the disciples of the Apostles, bishops. It partly preserves
a historic and partly assumes a dogmatic character. The former aspect appears in the appeal
made to the foundation of Churches by Apostles, and in the argument that each series of successors
were faithful disciples of those before them and therefore ultimately of the Apostles themselves.
But no historical consideration, no appeal to the "Elders" was capable of affording the assurance
sought for. Hence even in Irenæus the historical view of the case had clearly changed into
a dogmatic one. This, however, by no means resulted merely from the controversy with the heretics,
but was quite as much produced by the altered constitution of the Church and the authoritative
position that the bishops had actually attained. The idea was that the Elders, i.e., the bishops,
had received "cum episcopatus successione certum veritatis charisma," that is, their office
conferred on them the apostolic heritage of truth, which was therefore objectively attached
to this dignity as a charism. This notion of the transmissibility of the charism of truth became
associated with the episcopal office after it had become a monarchical one, exercising authority
over the Church in all its relations;[135] and after the bishops had proved themselves the
strongest supports of the communities against the attacks of the secular power and of heresy.[136]
In Irenæus and Tertullian, however, we only find the first traces of this new theory. The old
notion, which regarded the Churches as possessing the heritage of the Apostles in so far as
they possess the Holy Spirit, continued to exercise a powerful influence on these writers,
who still united the new dogmatic view with a historical one, at least in controversies with
the heretics. Neither Irenæus, nor Tertullian in his earlier writings,[137] asserted that the
transmission of the charisma veritatis to the bishops had really invested them with the apostolic
office in its full sense. They had indeed, according to Irenæus, received the "locum magisterii
apostolorum" ("place of government of the Apostles"), but nothing more. It is only the later
writings of Tertullian, dating from the reigns of Caracalla and Heliogabalus, which show that
the bishop of Rome, who must have had imitators in this respect, claimed for his office the
full authority of the apostolic office. Both Calixtus and his rival Hippolytus described themselves
as successors of the Apostles in the full sense of the word, and claimed for themselves in
that capacity much more than a mere guaranteeing of the purity of Christianity. Even Tertullian
did not question this last mentioned attribute of the bishops.[138] Cyprian found the theory
already in existence, but was the first to develop it definitely and to eradicate every remnant
of the historical argument in its favour. The conception of the Church was thereby subjected
to a further transformation.

2. The transformation of the idea of the Church by Cyprian completed the radical changes that
had been gradually taking place from the last half of the second century.[139] In order to
understand them it is necessary to go back. It was only with slowness and hesitation that the
theories of the Church followed the actual changes in her history. It may be said that the
idea of the Church always remained a stage behind the condition reached in practice. That may
be seen in the whole course of the history of dogma up to the present day.

The essential character of Christendom in its first period was a new holy life and a sure hope,
both based on repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ and brought about by the Holy
Spirit. Christ and the Church, that is, the Holy Spirit and the holy Church, were inseparably
connected. The Church, or, in other words, the community of all believers, attains her unity
through the Holy Spirit. This unity manifested itself in brotherly love and in the common relation
to a common ideal and a common hope.[140] The assembly of all Christians is realised in the
Kingdom of God, viz., in heaven; on earth Christians and the Church are dispersed and in a
foreign land. Hence, properly speaking, the Church herself is a heavenly community inseparable
from the heavenly Christ. Christians believe that they belong to a real super-terrestrial commonwealth,
which, from its very nature, cannot be realised on earth. The heavenly goal is not yet separated
from the idea of the Church; there is a holy Church on earth in so far as heaven is her destination.[141]
Every individual congregation is to be an image of the heavenly Church.[142] Reflections were
no doubt made on the contrast between the empirical community and the heavenly Church whose
earthly likeness it was to be (Hermas); but these did not affect the theory of the subject.
Only the saints of God, whose salvation is certain, belong to her, for the essential thing
is not to be called, but to be, a Christian. There was as yet no empirical universal Church
possessing an outward legal title that could, so to speak, be detached from the personal Christianity
of the individual Christian.[143] All the lofty designations which Paul, the so-called Apostolic
Fathers, and Justin gathered from the Old Testament and applied to the Church, relate to the
holy community which originates in heaven and returns thither.[144]

But, in consequence of the naturalising of Christianity in the world and the repelling of heresy,
a formulated creed was made the basis of the Church. This confession was also recognised as
a foundation of her unity and guarantee of her truth, and in certain respects as the main one.
Christendom protected itself by this conception, though no doubt at a heavy price. To Irenæus
and Tertullian the Church rests entirely on the apostolic, traditional faith which legitimises
her.[145] But this faith itself appeared as a law and aggregate of doctrines, all of which
are of equally fundamental importance, so that their practical aim became uncertain and threatened
to vanish ("fides in regula posita est, habet legem et salutem de observatione legis").

The Church herself, however, became a union based on the true doctrine and visible in it; and
this confederation was at the same time enabled to realise an actual outward unity by means
of the apostolic inheritance, the doctrinal confession, and the apostolic writings. The narrower
and more external character assumed by the idea of the Church was concealed by the fact that,
since the latter half of the second century, Christians in all parts of the world had really
united in opposition to the state and "heresy," and had found compensation for the incipient
decline of the original lofty thoughts and practical obligations in the consciousness of forming
an ecumenical and international alliance. The designation "Catholic Church" gave expression
to the claim of this world-wide union of the same faith to represent the true Church.[146]
This expression corresponds to the powerful position which the "great Church" (Celsus), or
the "old" Church (Clemens Alex.) had attained by the end of the second century, as compared
with the Marcionite Church, the school sects, the Christian associations of all kinds, and
the independent Christians. This Church, however, was declared to be apostolic, i.e., founded
in its present form by Christ through the Apostles. Through this idea, which was supported
by the old enthusiastic notion that the Apostles had already proclaimed the Gospel to all the
world, it came to be completely forgotten how Christ and his Apostles had exercised their ministry,
and an empirical conception of the Church was created in which the idea of a holy life in the
Spirit could no longer be the ruling one. It was taught that Christ received from God a law
of faith, which, as a new lawgiver, he imparted to the Apostles, and that they, by transmitting
the truth of which they were the depositaries, founded the one Catholic Church (Iren. III.
4. I). The latter, being guardian of the apostolic heritage, has the assurance of possessing
the Spirit; whereas all communities other than herself, inasmuch as they have not received
that deposit, necessarily lack the Spirit and are therefore separated from Christ and salvation.[147]
Hence one must be a member of this Church in order to be a partaker of salvation, because in
her alone one can find the creed which must be recognised as the condition of redemption.[148]
Consequently, in proportion as the faith became a doctrine of faith, the Catholic Church interposed
herself as an empiric power between the individual and salvation. She became a condition of
salvation; but the result was that she ceased to be a sure communion of the saved and of saints
(see on this point the following chapter). It was quite a logical proceeding when about the
year 220 Calixtus, a Roman bishop, started the theory that there must be wheat and tares in
the Catholic Church and that the Ark of Noah with its clean and unclean beasts was her type.[149]
The departure from the old idea of the Church appears completed in this statement. But the
following facts must not be overlooked:--First, the new conception of the Church was not yet
a hierarchical one. Secondly, the idea of the union and unity of all believers found here magnificent
expression. Thirdly, the development of the communities into one solid Church also represents
the creative power of the Christian spirit. Fourthly, through the consolidation effected in
the Church by the rule of faith the Christian religion was in some measure preserved from enthusiastic
extravagancies and arbitrary misinterpretation. Fifthly, in consequence of the regard for a
Church founded on the doctrine of faith the specific significance of redemption by Christ,
as distinguished from natural religion and that of the Old Testament, could no longer be lost
to believers. Sixthly, the independence of each individual community had a wide scope not only
at the end of the second but also in the third century.[150] Consequently, though the revolution
which led to the Catholic Church was a result of the situation of the communities in the world
in general and of the struggle with the Gnostics and Marcion in particular, and though it was
a fatal error to identify the Catholic and apostolic Churches, this change did not take place
without an exalting of the Christian spirit and an awakening of its self-consciousness.

But there was never a time in history when the conception of the Church, as nothing else than
the visible communion of those holding the correct apostolic doctrine, was clearly grasped
or exclusively emphasised. In Irenæus and Tertullian we rather find, on the one hand, that
the old theory of the Church was still to a great extent preserved and, on the other, that
the hierarchical notion was already making its appearance. As to the first point, Irenæus frequently
asserts that the Spirit and the Church, that is, the Christian people, are inseparable; that
the Spirit in divers ways continually effects whatever she needs; that she is the totality
of all true believers, that all the faithful have the rank of priests; that outside the holy
Church there is no salvation, etc.; in fact these doctrines form the very essence of his teaching.
But, since she was also regarded as the visible institution for objectively preserving and
communicating the truth, and since the idea of the Church in contradistinction to heresy was
necessarily exhausted in this as far as Irenæus was concerned, the old theories of the matter
could not operate correctively, but in the end only served to glorify the earthly Catholic
Church.[151] The proposition that truth is only to be found in the Church and that she and
the Holy Spirit are inseparable must be understood in Irenæus as already referring to the Catholic
Church in contradistinction to every other calling itself Christian.[152] As to the second
point, it cannot be denied that, though Irenæus desires to maintain that the only essential
part of the idea of the Church is the fact of her being the depository of the truth, he was
no longer able to confine himself to this (see above). The episcopal succession and the transmission
to the bishops of the magisterium of the Apostles were not indeed of any direct importance
to his idea of the Church, but they were of consequence for the preservation of truth and therefore
indirectly for the idea of the Church also. To Irenæus, however, that theory was still nothing
more than an artificial line; but artificial lines are really supports and must therefore soon
attain the value of foundations.[153] Tertullian's conception of the Church was essentially
the same as that of Irenæus; but with the former the idea that she is the outward manifestation
of the Spirit, and therefore a communion of those who are spiritual, at all times continued
to operate more powerfully than with the latter. In the last period of his life Tertullian
emphasised this theory so vigorously that the Antignostic idea of the Church being based on
the "traditio unius sacramenti" fell into the background. Consequently we find nothing more
than traces of the hierarchical conception of the Church in Tertullian. But towards the end
of his life he found himself face to face with a fully developed theory of this kind. This
he most decidedly rejected, and, in doing so, advanced to such a conception of ecclesiastical
orders, and therefore also of the episcopate, as clearly involved him in a contradiction of
the other theory--which he also never gave up--viz., that the bishops, as the class which transmits
the rule of faith, are an apostolic institution and therefore necessary to the Church[154].

From the disquisitions of Clement of Alexandria we see how vigorous the old conception of the
Church, as the heavenly communion of the elect and believing, still continued to be about the
year 200. This will not appear strange after what we have already said as to Clement's views
about the rule of faith, the New Testament, and the episcopate. It is evident that his philosophy
of religion led him to give a new interpretation to the original ideas. Yet the old form of
these notions can be more easily made out from his works than from those of Irenæus.[155] Up
to the 15th Chapter of the 7th Book of his great work, the Stromateis, and in the Pædagogus,
Clement simply speaks of the Church in the sense of the Epistle to the Ephesians and the Shepherd
of Hermas. She is a heavenly formation, continued in that which appears on earth as her image.
Instead of distinguishing two Churches Clement sees one, the product of God's will aiming at
the salvation of man--a Church which is to be on earth as it is in heaven, and of which faith
forms the subjective and the Logos the objective bond of union. But, beginning with Strom.
VII. 15 (see especially 17), where he is influenced by opposition to the heretics, he suddenly
identifies this Church with the single old Catholic one, that is, with the visible "Church"
in opposition to the heretic sects. Thus the empirical interpretation of the Church, which
makes her the institution in possession of the true doctrine, was also completely adopted by
Clement; but as yet he employed it simply in polemics and not in positive teachings. He neither
reconciled nor seemingly felt the contradiction in the statement that the Church is to be at
one and the same time the assembly of the elect and the empiric universal Church. At any rate
he made as yet no unconditional acknowledgment of the Catholic Church, because he was still
able to attribute independent value to Gnosis, that is, to independent piety as he understood
it.[156] Consequently, as regards the conception of the Church, the mystic Gnosis exercised
the same effect as the old religious enthusiasm from which in other respects it differs so
much.[157] The hierarchy has still no significance as far as Clement's idea of the Church is
concerned.[158] At first Origen entirely agrees with Clement in regard to this conception.
He also starts with the theory that the Church is essentially a heavenly communion and a holy
communion of believers, and keeps this idea constantly before him.[159] When opposing heretics,
he also, like Clement, cannot help identifying her with the Catholic Church, because the latter
contains the true doctrine, though he likewise refrains from acknowledging any hierarchy.[160]
But Origen is influenced by two further considerations, which are scarcely hinted at in Clement,
but which were called forth by the actual course of events and signified a further development
in the idea of the Church. For, in the first place, Origen saw himself already compelled to
examine closely the distinction between the essence and the outward appearance of the Church,
and, in this process, reached results which again called in question the identification of
the Holy Church with the empiric Catholic one (see on this point the following chapter). Secondly,
in consequence of the extraordinary extension and powerful position attained by the Catholic
Church by the time of Philip the Arabian, Origen, giving a new interpretation to a very old
Christian notion and making use of a Platonic conception,[161] arrived at the idea that she
was the earthly Kingdom of God, destined to enter the world, to absorb the Roman Empire and
indeed all mankind, and to unite and take the place of the various secular states.[162] This
magnificent idea, which regards the Church as [Greek: kosmos tou kosmou][163], denoted indeed
a complete departure from the original theory of the subject, determined by eschatological
considerations; though we must not forget that Origen still demanded a really holy Church and
a new polity. Hence, as he also distinguishes the various degrees of connection with the Church,[164]
we already find in his theory a combination of all the features that became essential parts
of the conception of the Church in subsequent times, with the exception of the clerical element.[165]

3. The contradictory notions of the Church, for so they appear to us, in Irenæus and Clement
and still more in Tertullian and Origen, need not astonish any one who bears in mind that none
of these Fathers made the Church the subject of a theological theory.[166] Hence no one as
yet thought of questioning the old article: "I believe in a holy Church." But, at the same
time, actual circumstances, though they did not at first succeed in altering the Church's belief,
forced her to realise her changed position, for she had in point of fact become an association
which was founded on a definite law of doctrine and rejected everything that did not conform
to it. The identifying of this association with the ideal Church was a matter of course,[167]
but it was quite as natural to take no immediate theoretical notice of the identification except
in cases where it was absolutely necessary, that is, in polemics. In the latter case the unity
of faith and hope became the unity of the doctrine of faith, and the Church was, in this instance,
legitimised by the possession of the apostolic tradition instead of by the realising of that
tradition in heart and life. From the principle that had been set up it necessarily followed
that the apostolic inheritance on which the truth and legitimacy of the Church was based, could
not but remain an imperfect court of appeal until living authorities could be pointed to in
this court, and until every possible cause of strife and separation was settled by reference
to it. An empirical community cannot be ruled by a traditional written word, but only by persons;
for the written law will always separate and split. If it has such persons, however, it can
tolerate within it a great amount of individual differences, provided that the leaders subordinate
the interests of the whole to their own ambition. We have seen how Irenæus and Tertullian,
though they in all earnestness represented the fides catholica and ecclesia catholica as inseparably
connected,[168] were already compelled to have recourse to bishops in order to ensure the apostolic
doctrine. The conflicts within the sphere of the rule of faith, the struggles with the so-called
Montanism, but finally and above all, the existing situation of the Church in the third century
with regard to the world within her pale, made the question of organisation the vital one for
her. Tertullian and Origen already found themselves face to face with episcopal claims of which
they highly disapproved and which, in their own way, they endeavoured to oppose. It was again
the Roman bishop[169] who first converted the proposition that the bishops are direct successors
of the Apostles and have the same "locus magisterii" ("place of government") into a theory
which declares that all apostolic powers have devolved on the bishops and that these have therefore
peculiar rights and duties in virtue of their office.[170] Cyprian added to this the corresponding
theory of the Church. In one decisive point, however, he did not assist the secularising process
which had been completed by the Roman bishop, in the interest of Catholicity as well as in
that of the Church's existence (see the following chapter). In the second half of the third
century there were no longer any Churches, except remote communities, where the only requirement
was to preserve the Catholic faith; the bishops had to be obeyed. The idea of the one episcopally
organised Church became the main one and overshadowed the significance of the doctrine of faith
as a bond of unity. The Church based on the bishops, the successors of the Apostles, the vicegerents
of God, is herself the legacy of the Apostles in virtue of this her foundation. This idea was
never converted into a rigid theory in the East, though the reality to which it corresponded
was not the less certain on that account. The fancy that the earthly hierarchy was the image
of the heavenly was the only part that began to be taken in real earnest. In the West, on the
other hand, circumstances compelled the Carthaginian bishop to set up a finished theory.[171]
According to Cyprian, the Catholic Church, to which all the lofty predictions and predicates
in the Bible apply (see Hartel's index under "ecclesia"), is the one institution of salvation
outside of which there is no redemption (ep. 73. 21). She is this, moreover, not only as the
community possessing the true apostolic faith, for this definition does not exhaust her conception,
but as a harmoniously organised federation.[172] This Church therefore rests entirely on the
episcopate, which sustains her,[173] because it is the continuance of the apostolic office
and is equipped with all the power of the Apostles.[174] Accordingly, the union of individuals
with the Church, and therefore with Christ, is effected only by obedient dependence on the
bishop, i.e., such a connection alone makes one a member of the Church. But the unity of the
Church, which is an attribute of equal importance with her truth, because this union is only
brought about by love,[175] primarily appears in the unity of the episcopate. For, according
to Cyprian, the episcopate has been from its beginning undivided and has continued to be so
in the Church, in so far as the bishops are appointed and guided by God, are on terms of brotherly
intercourse and exchange, and each bishop represents the whole significance of the episcopate.[176]
Hence the individual bishops are no longer to be considered primarily as leaders of their special
communities, but as the foundation of the one Church. Each of these prelates, however, provided
he keeps within the association of the bishops, preserves the independent right of regulating
the circumstances of his own diocese.[177] But it also follows that the bishops of those communities
founded by the Apostles themselves can raise no claim to any special dignity, since the unity
of the episcopate as a continuation of the apostolic office involves the equality of all bishops.[178]
However, a special importance attaches to the Roman see, because it is the seat of the Apostle
to whom Christ first granted apostolic authority in order to show with unmistakable plainness
the unity of these powers and the corresponding unity of the Church that rests on them; and
further because, from her historical origin, the Church of this see had become the mother and
root of the Catholic Church spread over the earth. In a severe crisis which Cyprian had to
pass through in his own diocese he appealed to the Roman Church (the Roman bishop) in a manner
which made it appear as if communion with that Church was in itself the guarantee of truth.
But in the controversy about heretical baptism with the Roman bishop Stephen, he emphatically
denied the latter's pretensions to exercise special rights over the Church in consequence of
the Petrine succession.[179] Finally, although Cyprian exalted the unity of the organisation
of the Church above the unity of the doctrine of faith, he preserved the Christian element
so far as to assume in all his statements that the bishops display a moral and Christian conduct
in keeping with their office, and that otherwise they have ipso facto forfeited it.[180] Thus,
according to Cyprian, the episcopal office does not confer any indelible character, though
Calixtus and other bishops of Rome after him presupposed this attribute. (For more details
on this point, as well as with regard to the contradictions that remain unreconciled in Cyprian's
conception of the Church, see the following chapter, in which will be shown the ultimate interests
that lie at the basis of the new idea of the Church).

Addendum I.--The great confederation of Churches which Cyprian presupposes and which he terms
the Church was in truth not complete, for it cannot be proved that it extended to any regions
beyond the confines of the Roman Empire or that it even embraced all orthodox and episcopally
organised communities within those bounds.[181] But, further, the conditions of the confederation,
which only began to be realised in the full sense in the days of Constantine, were never definitely
formulated--before the fourth century at least.[182] Accordingly, the idea of the one exclusive
Church, embracing all Christians and founded on the bishops, was always a mere theory. But,
in so far as it is not the idea, but its realisation to which Cyprian here attaches sole importance,
his dogmatic conception appears to be refuted by actual circumstances.[183]

Addendum II.--The idea of heresy is always decided by the idea of the Church. The designation
[Greek: hairesis] implies an adherence to something self-chosen in opposition to the acknowledgment
of something objectively handed down, and assumes that this is the particular thing in which
the apostasy consists. Hence all those who call themselves Christians and yet do not adhere
to the traditional apostolic creed, but give themselves up to vain and empty doctrines, are
regarded as heretics by Hegesippus, Irenæus, Tertullian, Clement, and Origen. These doctrines
are as a rule traced to the devil, that is, to the non-Christian religions and speculations,
or to wilful wickedness. Any other interpretation of their origin would at once have been an
acknowledgment that the opponents of the Church had a right to their opinions,[184] and such
an explanation is not quite foreign to Origen in one of his lines of argument.[185] Hence the
orthodox party were perfectly consistent in attaching no value to any sacrament[186] or acts
esteemed in their own communion, when these were performed by heretics;[187] and this was a
practical application of the saying that the devil could transform himself into an angel of
light.[188]

But the Fathers we have named did not yet completely identify the Church with a harmoniously
organised institution. For that very reason they do not absolutely deny the Christianity of
such as take their stand on the rule of faith, even when these for various reasons occupy a
position peculiar to themselves. Though we are by no means entitled to say that they acknowledged
orthodox schismatics, they did not yet venture to reckon them simply as heretics.[189] If it
was desired to get rid of these, an effort was made to impute to them some deviation from the
rule of faith; and under this pretext the Church freed herself from the Montanists and the
Monarchians.[190] Cyprian was the first to proclaim the identity of heretics and schismatics,
by making a man's Christianity depend on his belonging to the great episcopal Church confederation.[191]
But, both in East and West, this theory of his became established only by very imperceptible
degrees, and indeed, strictly speaking, the process was never completed at all. The distinction
between heretics and schismatics was preserved, because it prevented a public denial of the
old principles, because it was advisable on political grounds to treat certain schismatic communities
with indulgence, and because it was always possible in case of need to prove heresy against
the schismatics.[192]

Addendum III.--As soon as the empiric Church ruled by the bishops was proclaimed to be the
foundation of the Christian religion, we have the fundamental premises for the conception that
everything progressively adopted by the Church, all her functions, institutions, and liturgy,
in short, all her continuously changing arrangements were holy and apostolic. But the courage
to draw all the conclusions here was restrained by the fact that certain portions of tradition,
such as the New Testament canon of Scripture and the apostolic doctrine, had been once for
all exalted to an unapproachable height. Hence it was only with slowness and hesitation that
Christians accepted the inferences from the idea of the Church in the remaining directions,
and these conclusions always continued to be hampered with some degree of uncertainty. The
idea of the [Greek: paradosis agraphos]; (unwritten tradition); i.e., that every custom, however
recent, within the sphere of outward regulations, of public worship, discipline, etc., is as
holy and apostolic as the Bible and the "faith", never succeeded in gaining complete acceptance.
In this case, complicated, uncertain, and indistinct assumptions were the result.

Footnotes:

[Footnote 20: In itself the predicate "Catholic" contains no element that signifies a secularising
of the Church. "Catholic" originally means Christianity in its totality as contrasted with
single congregations. Hence the concepts "all communities" and the "universal Church" are identical.
But from the beginning there was a dogmatic element in the concept of the universal Church,
in so far as the latter was conceived to have been spread over the whole earth by the Apostles;
an idea which involved the conviction that only that could be true which was found everywhere
in Christendom. Consequently, "entire or universal Christendom," "the Church spread over the
whole earth," and "the true Church" were regarded as identical conceptions. In this way the
concept "Catholic" became a pregnant one, and finally received a dogmatic and political content.
As this result actually took place, it is not inappropriate to speak of pre-Catholic and Catholic
Christianity.]

[Footnote 21: Translator's note. The following is Tertullian's Latin as given by Professor
Harnack: Cap. 21: "Constat omnem doctrinam quæ cum ecclesiis apostolicis matricibus et originalibus
fidei conspiret veritati deputandam, id sine dubio tenentem quod ecclesiæ ab apostolis, apostoli
a Christo, Christus a deo accepit." Cap. 36: "Videamus quid (ecclesia Romanensis) didicerit,
quid docuerit, cum Africanis quoque ecclesiis contesserarit. Unum deum dominum novit, creatorem
universitatis, et Christum Iesum ex virgine Maria filium dei creatoris, et carnis resurrectionem;
legem et prophetas cum evangelicis et apostolicis litteris miscet; inde potat fidem, eam aqua
signat, sancto spiritu vestit, eucharistia pascit, martyrium exhortatur, et ita adversus hanc
institutionem neminem recipit." Chap. 32: "Evolvant ordinem episcoporum suorum, ita per successionem
ab initio decurrentem, ut primus ille episcopus aliquem ex apostolis vel apostolicis viris,
qui tamen cum apostolis perseveravit, habuerit auctorem et antecessorem."]

[Footnote 22: None of the three standards, for instance, were in the original of the first
six books of the Apostolic Constitutions, which belong to the third century and are of Syrian
origin; but instead of them the Old Testament and Gospel on the one hand, and the bishop, as
the God of the community, on the other, are taken as authorities.]

f. Kirchl. Wissensch. u. Kirchl. Leben, 1881, Part 6, p. 302 ff., especially p. 314 ff. In
the Epistle of Jude, v. 3, mention is made of the [Greek: hapax paradotheisa tois hagiois pistis],
and in v. 20 of "building yourselves up in your most holy faith." See Polycarp, ep. III. 2
(also VII. 2; II. 1). In either case the expressions [Greek: kanôn tês pisteôs, kanôn tês alêtheias],
or the like, might stand for [Greek: pistis], for the faith itself is primarily the canon;
but it is the canon only in so far as it is comprehensible and plainly defined. Here lies the
transition to a new interpretation of the conception of a standard in its relation to the faith.
Voigt has published an excellent investigation of the concept [Greek: ho kanôn tês alêtheias]
cum synonymis (Eine verschollene Urkunde des antimont. Kampfes, 1891, pp. 184-205).]

[Footnote 24: In Hermas, Mand. I., we find a still shorter formula which only contains the
Confession of the monarchy of God, who created the world, that is the formula [Greek: pisteôu
eis hena theon pantakratora], which did not originate with the baptismal ceremony. But though
at first the monarchy may have been the only dogma in the strict sense, the mission of Jesus
Christ beyond doubt occupied a place alongside of it from the beginning; and the new religion
was inconceivable without this.]

[Footnote 25: See on this point Justin, index to Otto's edition. It is not surprising that
formulæ similar to those used at baptism were employed in the exorcism of demons. However,
we cannot immediately infer from the latter what was the wording of the baptismal confession.
Though, for example, it is an established fact that in Justin's time demons were exorcised
with the words: "In the name of Jesus Christ who was crucified under Pontius Pilate," it does
not necessarily follow from this that these words were also found in the baptismal confession.
The sign of the cross was made over those possessed by demons; hence nothing was more natural
than that these words should be spoken. Hence they are not necessarily borrowed from a baptismal
confession.]

[Footnote 26: These facts were known to every Christian. They are probably also alluded to
in Luke I. 4.]

[Footnote 27: The most important result of Caspari's extensive and exact studies is the establishment
of this fact and the fixing of the wording of the Romish Confession. (Ungedruckte, unbeachtete
und wenig beachtete Quellen z. Gesch. des Taufsymbols u d. Glaubensregels. 3 Vols. 1866-1875.

"Apostol. Symbol" in Herzog's R.E.. 2nd. ed., as well as Book I. of the present work, Chap.
III. § 2.]

[Footnote 28: This supposition is based on observation of the fact that particular statements
of the Roman Symbol, in exactly the same form or nearly so, are found in many early Christian
writings. See Patr. App. Opp. I. 2, ed. 2, pp. 115-42.]

[Footnote 29: The investigations which lead to this result are of a very complicated nature
and cannot therefore be given here. We must content ourselves with remarking that all Western
baptismal formulæ (creeds) may be traced back to the Roman, and that there was no universal
Eastern creed on parallel lines with the latter. There is no mistaking the importance which,
in these circumstances, is to be attributed to the Roman symbol and Church as regards the development
of Catholicism.]

[Footnote 30: This caused the pronounced tendency of the Church to the formation of dogma,
a movement for which Paul had already paved the way. The development of Christianity, as attested,
for example, by the [Greek: Didachê], received an additional factor in the dogmatic tradition,
which soon gained the upper hand. The great reaction is then found in monasticism. Here again
the rules of morality become the prevailing feature, and therefore the old Christian gnomic
literature attains in this movement a second period of vigour. In it again dogmatics only form
the background for the strict regulation of life. In the instruction given as a preparation
for baptism the Christian moral commandments were of course always inculcated, and the obligation
to observe these was expressed in the renunciation of Satan and all his works. In consequence
of this, there were also fixed formulæ in these cases.]

[Footnote 31: See the Pastoral Epistles, those of John and of Ignatius; also the epistle of
Jude, 1 Clem. VII., Polycarp, ad Philipp. VII., II. 1, VI. 3, Justin.]

[Footnote 32: In the apologetic writings of Justin the courts of appeal invariably continue
to be the Old Testament, the words of the Lord, and the communications of prophets; hence he
has hardly insisted on any other in his anti-heretical work. On the other hand we cannot appeal
to the observed fact that Tertullian also, in his apologetic writings, did not reveal his standpoint
as a churchman and opponent of heresy; for, with one exception, he did not discuss heretics
in these tractates at all. On the contrary Justin discussed their position even in his apologetic
writings; but nowhere, for instance, wrote anything similar to Theophilus' remarks in "ad Autol.,"
II. 14. Justin was acquainted with and frequently alluded to fixed formulæ and perhaps a baptismal
symbol related to the Roman, if not essentially identical with it. (See Bornemann. Das Taufsymbol
Justins in the Ztschr. f. K. G. Vol. III. p. 1 ff.), but we cannot prove that he utilised these
formulæ in the sense of Irenæus and Tertullian. We find him using the expression [Greek: orthognômones]
in Dial. 80. The resurrection of the flesh and the thousand years' kingdom (at Jerusalem) are
there reckoned among the beliefs held by the [Greek: orthognômones kata panta Christianoi].
But it is very characteristic of the standpoint taken up by Justin that he places between the
heretics inspired by demons and the orthodox a class of Christians to whom he gives the general
testimony that they are [Greek: tês katharas kai eusebous gnômês], though they are not fully
orthodox in so far as they reject one important doctrine. Such an estimate would have been
impossible to Irenæus and Tertullian. They have advanced to the principle that he who violates
the law of faith in one point is guilty of breaking it all.]

[Footnote 33: Hatch, "Organisation of the Church," p. 96.]

[Footnote 34: We can only conjecture that some teachers in Asia Minor contemporary with Irenæus,
or even of older date, and especially Melito, proceeded in like manner, adhering to Polycarp's
exclusive attitude. Dionysius of Corinth (Eusebius, H. E. IV. 23. 2, 4) may perhaps be also
mentioned.]

[Footnote 35: Irenæus set forth his theory in a great work, adv. hæres., especially in the
third book. Unfortunately his treatise, "[Greek: logos eis epideixin tou apostolikou kêrygmatos]",
probably the oldest treatise on the rule of faith, has not been preserved (Euseb., H. E. V. 26.)]

[Footnote 36: Irenæus indeed asserts in several passages that all Churches--those in Germany,
Iberia, among the Celts, in the East, in Egypt, in Lybia and Italy; see I. 10. 2; III. 3. 1;
III. 4. 1 sq.--possess the same apostolic kerygma; but "qui nimis probat nihil probat." The
extravagance of the expressions shows that a dogmatic theory is here at work. Nevertheless
this is based on the correct view that the Gnostic speculations are foreign to Christianity
and of later date.]

[Footnote 37: We must further point out here that Irenæus not only knew the tradition of the
Churches of Asia Minor and Rome, but that he had sat at the feet of Polycarp and associated
in his youth with many of the "elders" in Asia. Of these he knew for certain that they in part
did not approve of the Gnostic doctrines and in part would not have done so. The confidence
with which he represented his antignostic interpretation of the creed as that of the Church
of the Apostles was no doubt owing to this sure historical recollection. See his epistle to
Florinus in Euseb., H. E. V. 20 and his numerous references to the "elders" in his great work.
(A collection of these may be found in Patr. App. Opp. I. 3, p. 105 sq.)]

[Footnote 38: Caspari's investigations leave no room for doubt as to the relation of the rule
of faith to the baptismal confession. The baptismal confession was not a deposit resulting
from fluctuating anti-heretical rules of faith; but the latter were the explanations of the
baptismal confession. The full authority of the confession itself was transferred to every
elucidation that appeared necessary, in so far as the needful explanation was regarded as given
with authority. Each momentary formula employed to defend the Church against heresy has therefore
the full value of the creed. This explains the fact that, beginning with Irenæus' time, we
meet with differently formulated rules of faith, partly in the same writer, and yet each is
declared to be the rule of faith. Zahn is virtually right when he says, in his essay quoted
above, that the rule of faith is the baptismal confession. But, so far as I can judge, he has
not discerned the dilemma in which the Old Catholic Fathers were placed, and which they were
not able to conceal. This dilemma arose from the fact that the Church needed an apostolic creed,
expressed in fixed formulæ and at the same time definitely interpreted in an anti-heretical
sense; whereas she only possessed, and this not in all churches, a baptismal confession, contained
in fixed formulæ but not interpreted, along with an ecclesiastical tradition which was not
formulated, although it no doubt excluded the most offensive Gnostic doctrines. It was not
yet possible for the Old Catholic Fathers to frame and formulate that doctrinal confession,
and they did not attempt it. The only course therefore was to assert that an elastic collection
of doctrines which were ever being formulated anew, was a fixed standard in so far as it was
based on a fixed creed. But this dilemma--we do not know how it was viewed by opponents--proved
an advantage in the end, for it enabled churchmen to make continual additions to the rule of
faith, whilst at the same time continuing to assert its identity with the baptismal confession.
We must make the reservation, however, that not only the baptismal confession, but other fixed
propositions as well, formed the basis on which particular rules of faith were formulated.]

[Footnote 43: See I. c. 14: "Ceterum manente forma regulæ in suo ordine quantumlibet quæras
et tractes." See de virg. vol. 1.]

[Footnote 45: See de præscr. 21: "Si hæc ita sunt, constat perinde omnem doctrinam, quæ cum
illis ecclesiis apostolicis matricibus et originalibus fidei conspiret, veritati deputandum
... Superest ergo ut demonstremus an hæc nostra doctrina, cujus regulam supra edidimus, de
apostolorum traditione censeatur ... Communicamus cum ecclesiis catholicis, quod nulla doctrina
diversa." De præscr. 32: "Ecclesiæ, quæ licet nullum ex apostolis auctorem suum proferant,
ut multo posteriores, tamen in eadem fide conspirantes non minus apostolicæ deputantur pro
consanguinitate doctrinæ." That Tertullian regards the baptismal confession as identical with
the regula fidei, just as Irenæus does, is shown by the fact that in de spectac. 4 ("Cum aquam
ingressi Christianam fidem in legis suæ verba profitemur, renuntiasse nos diabolo et pompæ
et angelis eius ore nostro contestamur.") the baptismal confession is the lex. He also calls
it "sacramentum" (military oath) in ad mart. 3; de idolol. 6; de corona 11; Scorp. 4. But he
likewise gives the same designation to the interpreted baptismal confession (de præscr. 20,
32; adv. Marc. IV. 5); for we must regard the passages cited as referring to this. Adv. Marc.
I. 21: "regula sacramenti;" likewise V. 20, a passage specially instructive as to the fact
that there can be only one regula. The baptismal confession itself had a fixed and short form
(see de spectac. 4; de corona, 3: "amplius aliquid respondentes quam dominus in evangelio determinavit;"
de bapt. 2: "homo in aqua demissus et inter pauca verba tinctus;" de bapt. 6, 11; de orat.
2 etc.). We can still prove that, apart from a subsequent alteration, it was the Roman confession
that was used in Carthage in the days of Tertullian. In de præscr. 26 Tertullian admits that
the Apostles may have spoken some things "inter domesticos," but declares that they could not
be communications "quæ aliam regulam fidei superducerent."]

[Footnote 46: De præscr. 13; de virg. vol. 1; adv. Prax. 2. The latter passage is thus worded:
"Unicum quidem deum credimus, sub hac tamen dispensatione quam [Greek: oikonomian] dicimus,
ut unici del sit et filius sermo ipsius, qui ex ipso processerit, per quern omnia facta sunt
et sine quo factum est nihil, hunc missum a patre in virginem et ex ea natum, hominem et deum,

s. paracletum sanctificatorem fidei eorum qui credunt in patrem et filium et spiritum s. Hanc
regulam ab initio evangelii decucurrisse."]

[Footnote 47: De præscr. 13.]

[Footnote 48: L.c.]

[Footnote 49: L.c.]

[Footnote 50: L.c.: "id verbum filium eius appellatum, in nomine dei varie visum a patriarchis,
in prophetis semper auditum, postremo delatum ex spiritu patris dei et virtute in virginem
Mariam, carnem factum," etc.]

[Footnote 51: L.c.]

[Footnote 52: Adv. Prax. (according to the New Testament) on which he puts great value, and
thereby shows that he has by no means forgotten that Christianity is a matter of conduct. We
cannot enter more particularly into this rule here.]

[Footnote 54: Note here the use of "contesserare" in Tertullian. See de præscr. 20: "Itaque
tot ac tantæ ecclesiæ una est illa ab apostolis prima, ex qua omnes. Sic omnes prima et omnes
apostolicæ, dum una omnes. Probant unitatem communicatio pacis et appellatio fraternitatis
et contesseratio hospitalitatis, quæ iura non alia ratio regit quam eiusdem sacramenti una
traditio." De præscr. 36: "Videamus, quid ecclesia Romanensis cum Africanis ecclesiis contesserarit."]

[Footnote 55: We need not here discuss whether and in what way the model of the philosophic
schools was taken as a standard. But we may refer to the fact that from the middle of the second
century the Apologists, that is the Christian philosophers, had exercised a very great influence
on the Old Catholic Fathers. But we cannot say that 2. John 7-11 and Didache XI. 1 f. attest
the practice to be a very old one. These passages only show that it had preparatory stages;
the main element, namely, the formulated summary of the faith, is there sought for in vain.]

[Footnote 56: Herein lay the defect, even if the content of the law of faith had coincided
completely with the earliest tradition. A man like Tertullian knew how to protect himself in
his own way from this defect, but his attitude is not typical.]

[Footnote 57: Hegesippus, who wrote about the time of Eleutherus, and was in Rome about the
middle of the second century (probably somewhat earlier than Irenæus), already set up the apostolic
rule of faith as a standard. This is clear from the description of his work in Euseb., H. E.
IV. 8. 2 ([Greek: en pente sungrammasin tên aplanê paradosin tou apostolikou kêrygmatos hypomnêmatisamenos])
as well as from the fragments of this work (l.c. IV. 22. 2, 3: [Greek: ho orthos logos] and
§ 5 [Greek: emerisan tên henôsin tês ekklêsias phthorimaiois logois kata tou theou]; see also
§ 4). Hegesippus already regarded the unity of the Church as dependent on the correct doctrine.
Polycrates (Euseb., H. E. V. 24. 6) used the expression [Greek: ho kanôn tês pisteôs] in a
very wide sense. But we may beyond doubt attribute to him the same conception with regard to
the significance of the rule of faith as was held by his opponent Victor. The Antimontanist
(in Euseb. H. E. V. 16. 22.) will only allow that the martyrs who went to death for the [Greek:
kata alêtheian pistis] were those belonging to the Church. The regula fidei is not here meant,
as in this case it was not a subject of dispute. On the other hand, the anonymous writer in
Eusebius, H. E. V. 28. 6, 13 understood by [Greek: to ekklêsiastikon phronêma] or [Greek: ho
kanôn tês archaias pisteôs] the interpreted baptismal confession, just as Irenæus and Tertullian
did. Hippolytus entirely agrees with these (see Philosoph. Præf., p. 4. v. 50 sq. and X. 32-34).
Whether we are to ascribe the theory of Irenæus to Theophilus is uncertain. His idea of the
Church is that of Irenæus (ad Autol. II. 14): [Greek: dedôken ho Theos tô kosmô kumainomenô
kai cheimazomenô hypo tôn hamartêmatôn tas synagôgas, legomenas de ekklêsias hagias, en ais
kathaper limesin euormois en nêsois hai didaskaliai tês alêtheias eisin ... Kai hôsper au nêsoi
eisin heterai petrôdeis kai anudroi kai akarpoi kai thêriôdeis kai aoikêtoi epi blabê tôn pleontôn
... houtôs eisin hai didaskaliai tês planês, legô de tôn haireseôn, hai exapolluousin tous
prosiontas autais.]]

[Footnote 58: This has been contested by Caspari (Ztschr. f. Kirchl. Wissensch. 1886, Part.
7, p. 352 ff.: "Did the Alexandrian Church in Clement's time possess a baptismal confession
or not?"); but his arguments have not convinced me. Caspari correctly shows that in Clement
the expression "ecclesiastical canon" denotes the summary of the Catholic faith and of the
Catholic rule of conduct; but he goes on to trace the baptismal confession, and that in a fixed
form, in the expression [Greek: hê peri tôn megistôn homologia], Strom. VII. 15. 90 (see remarks
on this passage below), and is supported in this view by Voigt, l.c. p. 196 ff. I also regard
this as a baptismal confession; but it is questionable if it was definitely formulated, and
the passage is not conclusive on the point. But, supposing it to be definitely formulated,
who can prove that it went further than the formula in Hermas, Mand. I. with the addition of
a mere mention of the Son and Holy Spirit. That a free kerygma of Christ and some other matter
were added to Hermas, Mand. I. may still be proved by a reference to Orig. Comm. in Joh. XXXII.
9 (see the passage in vol. I. p. 155.).]

[Footnote 59: [Greek: Hê kyriakê didaskalia], e.g., VI. 15. 124; VI. 18. 165; VII. 10. 57;
VII. 15. 90; VII. 18. 165, etc.]

[Footnote 60: We do not find in Clement the slightest traces of a baptismal confession related
to the Roman, unless we reckon the [Greek: Theos pantokratôr] or [Greek: eis Th. p.] as such.
But this designation of God is found everywhere and is not characteristic of the baptismal
confession. In the lost treatise on the Passover Clement expounded the "[Greek: paradoseis
tôn archaiôn presbyterôn]" which had been transmitted to him.]

[Footnote 61: Considering the importance of the matter it is necessary to quote as copiously
as possible from original sources. In Strom. IV. 15. 98, we find the expression [Greek: ho
kanôn teê pisteôs]; but the context shows that it is used here in a quite general sense. With
regard to the statement of Paul: "whatever you do, do it to the glory of God," Clement remarks
[Greek: hosa hypo ton kanona tês pisteôs poiein epitetraptai]. In Strom. I. 19. 96; VI. 15.
125; VI. 18. 165; VII. 7. 41; VII. 15. 90; VII. 16. 105 we find [Greek: ho kanôn tês ekklêsias
(ekklêsiastikos)]. In the first passage that canon is the rule for the right observance of
the Lord's Supper. In the other passages it describes no doubt the correct doctrine, that is,
the rule by which the orthodox Gnostic has to be guided in contrast with the heretics who are
guided by their own desires (it is therefore parallel to the [Greek: didaskalia tou kyriou]);
but Clement feels absolutely no need to mention wherein this ecclesiastical canon consists.
In Strom IV. 1. 3; VI. 15. 124; VI 15. 131; VII. 16. 94, we find the expression [Greek: ho
kanôn tês alêtheias]. In the first passage it is said: [Greek: hê goun kata ton tês alêtheias
kanona gnôstikês paradoseôs physiologia, mallon de epopteia, ek tou peri kosmogonias êrtêtai
logou, enthende anabainousa epi to theologikon eidos]. Here no one can understand by the rule
of truth what Tertullian understood by it. Very instructive is the second passage in which
Clement is dealing with the right and wrong exposition of Scripture. He says first: [Greek:
parakatathêke apodidomenê Theô hê kata tên tou kyriou didaskalian dia tôn apostolôn autou tês
theosebous paradoseôs synesis te kai synaskêsis]; then he demands that the Scriptures be interpreted
[Greek: kata ton tês alêtheias kanona], or [Greek: t. ekklês. kan.]; and continues (125): [Greek:
kanôn de ekklêsiastikos hê synôdia kai hê symphônia nomou te kai prophêtôn tê kata tên tou
kyriou parousian paradidomenê diathêkê]. Here then the agreement of the Old Testament with
the Testament of Christ is described as the ecclesiastical canon. Apart from the question as
to whether Clement is here already referring to a New Testament canon of Scripture, his rule
agrees with Tertullian's testimony about the Roman Church: "legem et prophetas cum evangelicis
et apostolicis litteris miscet." But at any rate the passage shows the broad sense in which
Clement used the term "ecclesiastical canon." The following expressions are also found in Clement:
[Greek: hê alêthes tês makarias didaskalias paradosis] (I. 1. 11), [Greek: hai hagiai paradoseis]
(VII. 18. 110), [Greek: hê eukleês kai semnos tês paradoseôs kanôn] (all gnosis is to be guided
by this, see also [Greek: hê kata tên theian paradosin philosophia], I, 1. 15. I: 11. 52.,
also the expression [Greek: hê theia paradosis] (VII. 16. 103), [Greek: hê ekklêsiastike paradosis]
(VII. 16. 95), [Greek: hai tou Christou paradoseis] (VII. 16. 99), [Greek: hê tou kyriou paradosis]
(VII. 17. 106: VII. 16. 104), [Greek: hê theosebês paradosis] (VI. 15. 124)). Its content is
not more precisely defined, and, as a rule, nothing more can be gathered from the context than
what Clement once calls [Greek: to koinon tês pisteôs] (VII. 16. 97). Where Clement wishes
to determine the content more accurately he makes use of supplementary terms. He speaks, e.g.,
in III. 10. 66 of the [Greek: kata alêtheian euangelikos kanôn], and means by that the tradition
contained in the Gospels recognised by the Church in contradistinction to that found in other
gospels (IV. 4. 15: [Greek: kata ton kanona tou euangeliou] = [Greek: kata t. euang.]). In
none of these formulæ is any notice taken of the Apostles. That Clement (like Justin) traced
back the public tradition to the Apostles is a matter of course and manifest from I. 1. 11,
where he gives an account of his early teachers ([Greek: hoi men tên alêthê tês makarias sôzontes
didaskalias paradosin euthus apo Petrou te kai Iakôbou, Iôannou te kai Paulou tôn hagiôn apostolôn,
tais para patros ekdechomenos hêkon dê syn theô kai eis hêmas ta progonika ekeina kai apostolika
katathêsomenoi spermata]). Clement does not yet appeal to a hierarchical tradition through
the bishops, but adheres to the natural one through the teachers, though he indeed admits an
esoteric tradition alongside of it. On one occasion he also says that the true Gnostic keeps
the [Greek: apostolikê kai ekklêsiastikê orthotomia tôn dogmatôn] (VII. 16. 104). 17. 108).
But all that might just as well have been written in the first half of the second century.
On the tracing back of the Gnosis, the esoteric tradition, to the Apostles see Hypotyp. in
Euseb., H. E. II. 1. 4, Strom. VI. 15. 131: [Greek: autika didaxantos tou sôtêros tous apostolous
hê tês engraphou agraphos êdê kai eis hêmas diadidotai paradosis]. VI. 7. 61: [Greek: hê gnôsis
de autê hê kata diadochas] (this is the only place where I find this expression) [Greek: eis
oligous ek tôn apostolôn agraphôs paradotheisa katelêluthen], ibid [Greek: hê gnôstikê paradosis];
VII. 10. 55: [Greek: hê gnôsis ek paradoseôs diadidomenê tois axious sphas autous tês didaskalias
parechomenois oion parakatathêkê egcheirizetai]. In VII. 17. 106 Clement has briefly recorded
the theories of the Gnostic heretics with regard to the apostolic origin of their teaching,
and expressed his doubts. That the tradition of the "Old Church," for so Clement designates
the orthodox Church as distinguished from the "human congregation" of the heretics of his day,
is throughout derived from the Apostles, he regards as so certain and self-evident that, as
a rule, he never specially mentions it, or gives prominence to any particular article as apostolic.
But the conclusion that he had no knowledge of any apostolic or fixed confession might seem
to be disproved by one passage. It is said in Strom. VII. 15. 90: [Greek: Mê ti oun, ei kai
parabaiê tis synthêkas kai tên homologian parelthoi tên pros hêmas, dia ton pseusamenon tên
homologian aphexometha tês alêtheias kai hêmeis, all' hôs apseudein chrê ton epieikê kai mêden
hôn hupeschêtai akuroun kan alloi tines parabainôsi synthêkas, outôs kai hêmas kata mêdena
tropon ton ekklêsiastikon parabainein prosekei kanona kai malista tên peri tôn megistôn homologian
hêmeis men phylattomen, oi de parabainousi]. But in the other passages in Clement where [Greek:
homologia] appears it nowhere signifies a fixed formula of confession, but always the confession
in general which receives its content according to the situation (see Strom. IV. 4. 15; IV.
9. 71; III. 1. 4: [Greek: egkrateia sômatos hyperopsia kata tên pros theon homologian]). In
the passage quoted it means the confession of the main points of the true doctrine. It is possible
or probable that Clement was here alluding to a confession at baptism, but that is also not
quite certain. At any rate this one passage cannot prove that Clement identified the ecclesiastical
canon with a formulated confession similar to or identical with the Roman, or else such identification
must have appeared more frequently in his works.]

[Footnote 62: De princip. l. I. præf. § 4-10., IV. 2. 2. Yet we must consider the passage already
twice quoted, namely, Com. in John. XXXII. 9, in order to determine the practice of the Alexandrian
Church at that time. Was this baptismal confession not perhaps compiled from Herm., Mand. I.,
and Christological and theological teachings, so that the later confessions of the East with
their dogmatic details are already to be found here?]

[Footnote 63: That may be also shown with regard to the New Testament canon. Very important
is the declaration of Eusebius (H. E. VI. 14) that Origen, on his own testimony, paid a brief
visit to Rome in the time of Zephyrinus, "because he wished to become acquainted with the ancient
Church of the Romans." We learn from Jerome (de vir. inl. 61) that Origen there became acquainted
with Hippolytus, who even called attention to his presence in the church in a sermon. That
Origen kept up a connection with Rome still later and followed the conflicts there with keen
interest may be gathered from his works. (See Döllinger, "Hippolytus und Calixtus" p. 254 ff.)
On the other hand, Clement was quite unacquainted with that city. Bigg therefore l.c. rightly
remarks: "The West is as unknown to Clement as it was to his favourite Homer." That there was
a formulated [Greek: pistis kai homologia] in Alexandria about 250 A.D. is shown by the epistle
of Dionysius (Euseb., H. E. VII. 8). He says of Novatian, [Greek: anatrepei tên pro loutrou
pistin kai homologian]. Dionysius would hardly have reproduced this Roman reproach in that
way, if the Alexandrian Church had not possessed a similar [Greek: pistis].]

[Footnote 64: The original of the Apostolic Constitutions has as yet no knowledge of the Apostolic
rule of faith in the Western sense.]

[Footnote 65: The close of the first homily of Aphraates shows how simple, antique, and original
this confession still was in outlying districts at the beginning of the fourth century. On
the other hand, there were oriental communities where it was already heavily weighted with
theology.]

[Footnote 66: Cf. the epistles of Cyprian, especially ep. 69. 70. When Cyprian speaks (69.
7) of one and the same law which is held by the whole Catholic Church, and of one symbol with
which she administers baptism (this is the first time we meet with this expression), his words
mean far more than the assertion of Irenæus that the confession expounded by him is the guiding
rule in all Churches; for in Cyprian's time the intercourse of most Catholic communities with
each other was so regulated that the state of things in each was to some extent really known.
Cf. also Novatian, "de trinitate seu de regula fidei," as well as the circular letter of the
Synod of Antioch referring to the Metropolitan Paul (Euseb., H. E. VII. 30. 6 ... [Greek: apostas
tou kanonos epi kibdêla kai notha didagmata metelêluthen]), and the homilies of Aphraates.
The closer examination of the last phase in the development of the confession of faith during
this epoch, when the apostolic confessions received an interpretation in accordance with the
theology of Origen, will be more conveniently left over till the close of our description (see
chap. 7 fin).]

[Footnote 67: See the histories of the canon by Credner, Reuss, Westcott, Hilgenfeld, Schmiedel,
Holtzmann, and Weiss; the latter two, which to some extent supplement each other, are specially
instructive. To Weiss belongs the merit of having kept Gospels and Apostles clearly apart in
the preliminary history of the canon (see Th. L. Z. 1886. Nr. 24); Zahn, Gesch. des N. Tlichen
Kanons, 2 vols, 1888 ff.; Harnack, Das Neue Test. um d. J. 200, 1889; Voigt, Eine verschollene
Urkunde des antimontan. Kampfes, 1891, p. 236 ff.; Weizsäcker, Rede bei der akad. Preisvertheilung,
1892. Nov.; Köppel, Stud. u. Krit. 1891, p. 102 ff; Barth, Neue Jahrbb. f. deutsche Theologie,
1893, p. 56 ff. The following account gives only a few aspects of the case, not a history of
the genesis of the canon.]

[Footnote 68: "Holy" is not always equivalent to "possessing absolute authority." There are
also various stages and degrees of "holy."]

[Footnote 69: I beg here to lay down the following principles as to criticism of the New Testament.
(1) It is not individual writings, but the whole book that has been immediately handed down
to us. Hence, in the case of difficulties arising, we must first of all enquire, not whether
the title and historical setting of a book are genuine or not, but if they are original, or
were only given to the work when it became a component part of the collection. This also gives
us the right to assume interpolations in the text belonging to the time when it was included
in the canon, though this right must be used with caution. (2) Baur's "tendency-criticism"
has fallen into disrepute; hence we must also free ourselves from the pedantry and hair-splitting
which were its after effects. In consequence of the (erroneous) assumptions of the Tübingen
school of critics a suspicious examination of the texts was justifiable and obligatory on their
part. (3) Individual difficulties about the date of a document ought not to have the result
of casting suspicion on it, when other good grounds speak in its favour; for, in dealing with
writings which have no, or almost no accompanying literature, such difficulties cannot fail
to arise. (4) The condition of the oldest Christianity up to the beginning of the second century
did not favour literary forgeries or interpolations in support of a definite tendency. (5)
We must remember that, from the death of Nero till the time of Trajan, very little is known
of the history of the Church except the fact that, by the end of this time, Christianity had
not only spread to an astonishing extent, but also had become vigorously consolidated.]

[Footnote 70: The novelty lies first in the idea itself, secondly in the form in which it was
worked out, inasmuch as Marcion would only admit the authority of one Gospel to the exclusion
of all the rest, and added the Pauline epistles which had originally little to do with the
conception of the apostolic doctrinal tradition of the Church.]

[Footnote 71: It is easy to understand that, wherever there was criticism of the Old Testament,
the Pauline epistles circulating in the Church would be thrust into the foreground. The same
thing was done by the Manichæans in the Byzantine age.]

[Footnote 72: Four passages may be chiefly appealed to in support of the opposite view, viz.,
2 Peter III. 16; Polycarp ep. 12. 1; Barn. IV. 14; 2 Clem. II. 4. But the first is put out
of court, as the second Epistle of Peter is quite a late writing. The second is only known
from an unreliable Latin translation (see Zahn on the passage: "verba 'his scripturis' suspecta
sunt, cum interpres in c. II. 3 ex suis inseruerit quod dictum est"), and even if the latter
were faithful here, the quotation from the Psalms prefixed to the quotation from the Epistle
to the Ephesians prevents us from treating the passage as certain evidence. As to the third
passage ([Greek: mêpote, hôs gegraptai, polloi klêtoi, oligoi de eklektoi heurethômen]), it
should be noted that the author of the Epistle of Barnabas, although he makes abundant use
of the evangelic tradition, has nowhere else described evangelic writings as [Greek: graphê],
and must have drawn from more sources than the canonic Gospels. Here, therefore, we have an
enigma which may be solved in a variety of ways. It seems worth noting that it is a saying
of the Lord which is here in question. But from the very beginning words of the Lord were equally
reverenced with the Old Testament (see the Pauline Epistles). This may perhaps explain how
the author--like 2 Clem. II. 4: [Greek: hetera de graphê legei hoti ouk êlthon kalesai dikaious
alla hamartôlous]--has introduced a saying of this kind with the same formula as was used in
introducing Old Testament quotations. Passages, such as Clem. XIII. 4: [Greek: legei ho theos:
ou charis humin ei agapate k.t.l.] would mark the transition to this mode of expression. The
correctness of this explanation is confirmed by observation of the fact that the same formula
as was employed in the case of the Old Testament was used in making quotations from early Christian
apocalypses, or utterances of early Christian prophets in the earliest period. Thus we already
read in Ephesians V. 14: [Greek: dio legei: egeire ho katheudôn kai anasta ek tôn nekrôn kai
epiphausei soi ho Christos]. That, certainly, is a saying of a Christian prophet, and yet it
is introduced with the usual "[Greek: legei]". We also find a saying of a Christian prophet
in Clem. XXIII. (the saying is more complete in 2 Clem. XI.) introduced with the words: [Greek:
hê graphê hautê, hopou legei]. These examples may be multiplied still further. From all this
we may perhaps assume that the trite formulæ of quotation "[Greek: graphê], [Greek: gegraptai],"
etc., were applied wherever reference was made to sayings of the Lord and of prophets that
were fixed in writings, even when the documents in question had not yet as a whole obtained
canonical authority. Finally, we must also draw attention to the following:--The Epistle of
Barnabas belongs to Egypt; and there probably, contrary to my former opinion, we must also
look for the author of the second Epistle of Clement. There is much to favour the view that
in Egypt Christian writings were treated as sacred texts, without being united into a collection
of equal rank with the Old Testament. (See below on this point.)]

[Footnote 73: See on Justin Bousset. Die Evv.-Citate Justins. Gott., 1891. We may also infer
from the expression of Hegesippus (Euseb., H. E. IV. 22. 3; Stephanus Gobarus in Photius, Bibl.
232. p. 288) that it was not Christian writings, but the Lord himself, who was placed on an
equality with Law and Prophets. Very instructive is the formula: "Libri et epistolæ Pauli viri
iusti" ([Greek: hai kath' hêmas bibloi kai hai prosepitoutois epistolai Paulou tou hosiou andros]),
which is found in the Acta Mart. Scillit. anno 180 (ed. Robinson, Texts and Studies, 1891,
I. 2, p. 114 f.), and tempts us to make certain conclusions. In the later recensions of the
Acta the passage, characteristically enough, is worded: "Libri evangeliorum et epistolæ Pauli
viri sanctissimi apostoli" or "Quattuor evv. dom. nostri J. Chr. et epp. S. Pauli ap. et omnis
divinitus inspirata scriptura."]

[Footnote 74: It is worthy of note that the Gnostics also, though they quote the words of the
Apostles (John and Paul) as authoritative, place the utterances of the Lord on an unattainable
height. See in support of this the epistle of Ptolemy to Flora.]

[Footnote 75: Rev. I. 3; Herm. Vis. II. 4; Dionys. Cor. in Euseb., IV. 23. 11.]

[Footnote 76: Tertullian, this Christian of the primitive type, still reveals the old conception
of things in one passage where, reversing 2 Tim. III. 16, he says (de cultu fem. I. 3) "Legimus
omnem scripturam ædificationi habilem divinitus inspirari."]

[Footnote 77: The history of the collection of the Pauline Epistles may be traced back to the
first century (1 Clem. XLVII. and like passages). It follows from the Epistle of Polycarp that
this native of Asia Minor had in his hands all the Pauline Epistles (quotations are made from
nine of the latter; these nine imply the four that are wanting, yet it must remain an open
question whether he did not yet possess the Pastoral Epistles in their present form), also
1 Peter, 1 John (though he has not named the authors of these), the first Epistle of Clement
and the Gospels. The extent of the writings read in churches which Polycarp is thus seen to
have had approaches pretty nearly that of the later recognised canon. Compare, however, the
way in which he assumes sayings from those writings to be well known by introducing them with
"[Greek: eidotes]" (I. 3; IV. 1; V. 1). Ignatius likewise shows himself to be familiar with
the writings which were subsequently united to form the New Testament. We see from the works
of Clement, that, at the end of the second century, a great mass of Christian writings were
collected in Alexandria and were used and honoured.]

[Footnote 78: It should also be pointed out that Justin most probably used the Gospel of Peter
among the [Greek: apomnêmoneumata]; see Texte u. Unters. IX. 2.]

[Footnote 79: See my article in the Zeitschr. f. K. Gesch. Vol. IV. p. 471 ff. Zahn (Tatian's
Diatessaron, 1881) takes a different view.]

[Footnote 80: Justin also used the Gospel of John, but it is a disputed matter whether he regarded
and used it like the other Gospels.]

[Footnote 81: The Sabellians still used it in the third century, which is a proof of the great
authority possessed by this Gospel in Christian antiquity. (Epiph., H. 62. 2.)]

[Footnote 82: Euseb. H. E. IV. 29. 5.]

[Footnote 83: In many regions the Gospel canon alone appeared at first, and in very many others
it long occupied a more prominent place than the other canonical writings. Alexander of Alexandria,
for instance, still calls God the giver of the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospels (Theodoret,
I. 4).]

[Footnote 84: Euseb., H. E. II. 26. 13. As Melito speaks here of the [Greek: akribeia tôn palaiôn
bibliôn], and of [Greek: ta biblia tês palaias diathêkês], we may assume that he knows [Greek:
ta biblia tês kainês diathêkês].]

[Footnote 85: We may here leave undiscussed the hesitancy with regard to the admissibility
of particular books. That the Pastoral Epistles had a fixed place in the canon almost from
the very first is of itself a proof that the date of its origin cannot be long before 180.
In connection with this, however, it is an important circumstance that Clement makes the general
statement that the heretics reject the Epistles to Timothy (Strom. II. 12. 52: [Greek: hoi
apo tôn haireseôn tas pros Timotheon athetousin epistolas]). They did not happen to be at the
disposal of the Church at all till the middle of the second century.]

[Footnote 86: Yet see the passage from Tertullian quoted, p. 15, note 1; see also the "receptior,"
de pudic. 20, the cause of the rejection of Hermas in the Muratorian Fragment and Tertull.
de bapt. 17: "Quodsi quæ Pauli perperam scripta sunt exemplum Theclæ ad licentiam mulierum
docendi tinguendique defendunt, sciant in Asia presbyterum, qui eam scripturam construxit,
quasi titulo Pauli de suo cumulans, convictum atque confessum id se amore Pauli fecisse, loco
decessisse." The hypothesis that the Apostles themselves (or the apostle John) compiled the
New Testament was definitely set up by no one in antiquity and therefore need not be discussed.
Augustine (c. Faustum XXII. 79) speaks frankly of "sancti et docti homines" who produced the
New Testament. We can prove by a series of testimonies that the idea of the Church having compiled
the New Testament writings was in no way offensive to the Old Catholic Fathers. As a rule,
indeed, they are silent on the matter. Irenæus and Tertullian already treat the collection
as simply existent.]

[Footnote 87: Numerous examples may be found in proof of all these points, especially in the
writings of Tertullian, though such are already to be met with in Irenæus also. He is not yet
so bold in his allegorical exposition of the Gospels as Ptolemæus whom he finds fault with
in this respect; but he already gives an exegesis of the books of the New Testament not essentially
different from that of the Valentinians. One should above all read the treatise of Tertullian
"de idololatria" to perceive how the authority of the New Testament was even by that time used
for solving all questions.]

[Footnote 88: I cannot here enter into the disputed question as to the position that should
be assigned to the Muratorian Fragment in the history of the formation of the canon, nor into
its interpretation, etc. See my article "Das Muratorische Fragment und die Entstehung einer
Sammlung apostolisch-katholischer Schriften" in the Ztschr. f. K. Gesch. III. p. 358 ff. See
also Overbeck, Zur Geschichte des Kanons, 1880; Hilgenfeld, in the Zeitschrift f. Wissensch.
Theol. 1881, part 2; Schmiedel, Art. "Kanon" in Ersch. u. Gruber's Encykl., 2 Section, Vol.
XXXII. p. 309 ff.; Zahn, Kanongeschichte, Vol. II. p. 1 ff. I leave the fragment and the conclusions
I have drawn from it almost entirely out of account here. The following sketch will show that
the objections of Overbeck have not been without influence on me.]

[Footnote 89: The use of the word "canon" as a designation of the collection is first plainly
demonstrable in Athanasius (ep. fest. of the year 365) and in the 59th canon of the synod of
Laodicea. It is doubtful whether the term was already used by Origen. Besides, the word "canon"
was not applied even to the Old Testament before the fourth century. The name "New Testament"
(books of the New Testament) is first found in Melito and Tertullian. For other designations
of the latter see Ronsch, Das N. T. Tertullian's p. 47 f. The most common name is "Holy Scriptures."
In accordance with its main components the collection is designated as [Greek: to euangelion
kai ho apostolos] (evangelicæ et apostolicæ litteræ); see Tertullian, de bapt. 15: "tam ex
domini evangelio quam ex apostoli litteris." The name "writings of the Lord" is also found
very early. It was already used for the Gospels at a time when there was no such thing as a
canon. It was then occasionally transferred to all writings of the collection. Conversely,
the entire collection was named, after the authors, a collection of apostolic writings, just
as the Old Testament Scriptures were collectively called the writings of the prophets. Prophets
and Apostles (= Old and New Testament) were now conceived as the media of God's revelation
fixed in writing (see the Muratorian Fragment in its account of Hermas, and the designation
of the Gospels as "Apostolic memoirs" already found in Justin.) This grouping became exceedingly
important. It occasioned new speculations about the unique dignity of the Apostles and did
away with the old collocation of Apostles and Prophets (that is Christian prophets). By this
alteration we may measure the revolution of the times. Finally, the new collection was also
called "the writings of the Church" as distinguished from the Old Testament and the writings
of the heretics. This expression and its amplifications shew that it was the Church which selected
these writings.]

[Footnote 90: Here there is a distinction between Irenæus and Tertullian. The former disputed
with heretics about the interpretation of the Scriptures, the latter, although he has read
Irenæus, forbids such dispute. He cannot therefore have considered Irenæus' efforts as successful.]

[Footnote 91: The reader should remember the different recensions of the Gospels and the complaints
made by Dionysius of Corinth (in Euseb., H. E. IV. 23. 12).]

[Footnote 92: That the text of these writings was at the same time revised is more than probable,
especially in view of the beginnings and endings of many New Testament writings, as well as,
in the case of the Gospels, from a comparison of the canon text with the quotations dating
from the time when there was no canon. But much more important still is the perception of the
fact that, in the course of the second century, a series of writings which had originally been
circulated anonymously or under the name of an unknown author were ascribed to an Apostle and
were also slightly altered in accordance with this. In what circumstances or at what time this
happened, whether it took place as early as the beginning of the second century or only immediately
before the formation of the canon, is in almost every individual case involved in obscurity,
but the fact itself, of which unfortunately the Introductions to the New Testament still know
so little, is, in my opinion, incontestable. I refer the reader to the following examples,
without indeed being able to enter on the proof here (see my edition of the "Teaching of the
Apostles" p. 106 ff). (1) The Gospel of Luke seems not to have been known to Marcion under
this name, and to have been called so only at a later date. (2) The canonical Gospels of Matthew
and Mark do not claim, through their content, to originate with these men; they were regarded
as apostolic at a later period. (3) The so-called Epistle of Barnabas was first attributed
to the Apostle Barnabas by tradition. (4) The Apocalypse of Hermas was first connected with
an apostolic Hermas by tradition (Rom. XVI. 14). (5) The same thing took place with regard
to the first Epistle of Clement (Philipp, IV. 3). (6) The Epistle to the Hebrews, originally
the writing of an unknown author or of Barnabas, was transformed into a writing of the Apostle
Paul (Overbeck zur Gesch. des Kanons, 1880), or given out to be such. (7) The Epistle of James,
originally the communication of an early Christian prophet, or a collection of ancient holy
addresses, first seems to have received the name of James in tradition. (8) The first Epistle
of Peter, which originally appears to have been written by an unknown follower of Paul, first
received its present name from tradition. The same thing perhaps holds good of the Epistle
of Jude. Tradition was similarly at work, even at a later period, as may for example be recognised
by the transformation of the epistle "de virginitate" into two writings by Clement. The critics
of early Christian literature have created for themselves insoluble problems by misunderstanding
the work of tradition. Instead of asking whether the tradition is reliable, they always wrestle
with the dilemma "genuine or spurious", and can prove neither.]

[Footnote 93: As regards its aim and contents, this book is furthest removed from the claim
to be a portion of a collection of Holy Scriptures. Accordingly, so far as we know, its reception
into the canon has no preliminary history.]

[Footnote 94: People were compelled by internal and external evidence (recognition of their
apostolicity; example of the Gnostics) to accept the epistles of Paul. But, from the Catholic
point of view, a canon which comprised only the four Gospels and the Pauline Epistles, would
have been at best an edifice of two wings without the central structure, and therefore incomplete
and uninhabitable. The actual novelty was the bold insertion into its midst of a book, which,
if everything is not deceptive, had formerly been only in private use, namely, the Acts of
the Apostles, which some associated with an Epistle of Peter and an Epistle of John, others
with an Epistle of Jude, two Epistles of John, and the like. There were now (1) writings of
the Lord which were at the same time regarded as [Greek: apomnêmoneumata] of definite Apostles;
(2) a book which contained the acts and preaching of all the Apostles, which historically legitimised
Paul, and at the same time gave hints for the explanation of "difficult" passages in his Epistle;
(3) the Pauline Epistles increased by the compilation of the Pastoral ones, documents which
"in ordinatione ecclesiasticæ disciplinæ sanctificatæ erant." The Acts of the Apostles is thus
the key to the understanding of the Catholic canon and at the same time shows its novelty.
In this book the new collection had its bond of cohesion, its Catholic element (apostolic tradition),
and the guide for its exposition. That the Acts of the Apostles found its place in the canon
faute de mieux is clear from the extravagant terms, not at all suited to the book, in which
its appearance there is immediately hailed. It is inserted in place of a book which should
have contained the teaching and missionary acts of all the 12 Apostles; but, as it happened,
such a record was not in existence. The first evidence regarding it is found in the Muratorian
fragment and in Irenæus and Tertullian. There it is called "acta omnium apostolorum sub uno
libro scripta sunt, etc." Irenæus says (III. 14. 1): "Lucas non solum prosecutor sed et cooperarius
fuit Apostolorum, maxime autem Pauli," and makes use of the book to prove the subordination
of Paul to the twelve. In the celebrated passages, de præscr. 22, 23: adv. Marc. I. 20; IV.
2-5; V. 1-3, Tertullian made a still more extensive use of the Acts of the Apostles, as the
Antimarcionite book in the canon. One can see here why it was admitted into that collection
and used against Paul as the Apostle of the heretics. The fundamental thought of Tertullian
is that no one who fails to recognise the Acts of the Apostles has any right to recognise Paul,
and that to elevate him by himself into a position of authority is unhistorical and absolutely
unfounded fanaticism. If the [Greek: didachê tôn dôdeka apostolôn] was needed as an authority
in the earlier time, a book which contained that authority was required in the later period;
and nothing else could be found than the work of the so-called Luke. "Qui Acta Apostolorum
non recipiunt, nec spiritus sancti esse possunt, qui necdum spiritum sanctum possunt agnoscere
discentibus missum, sed nec ecclesiam se dicant defendere qui quando et quibus incunabulis
institutum est hoc corpus probare non habent." But the greater part of the heretics remained
obstinate. Neither Marcionites, Severians, nor the later Manicheans recognised the Acts of
the Apostles. To some extent they replied by setting up other histories of Apostles in opposition
to it, as was done later by a fraction of the Ebionites and even by the Marcionites. But the
Church also was firm. It is perhaps the most striking phenomenon in the history of the formation
of the canon that this late book, from the very moment of its appearance, asserts its right
to a place in the collection, just as certainly as the four Gospels, though its position varied.
In Clement of Alexandria indeed the book is still pretty much in the background, perhaps on
a level with the [Greek: kêrugma Petrou], but Clement has no New Testament at all in the strict
sense of the word; see below. But at the very beginning the book stood where it is to-day,
i.e., immediately after the Gospels (see Muratorian Fragment, Irenæus, etc.). The parallel
creation, the group of Catholic Epistles, acquired a much more dubious position than the Acts
of the Apostles, and its place was never really settled. Its germ is probably to be found in
two Epistles of John (viz., 1st and 3rd) which acquired dignity along with the Gospel, as well
as in the Epistle of Jude. These may have given the impulse to create a group of narratives
about the twelve Apostles from anonymous writings of old Apostles, prophets, and teachers.
But the Epistle of Peter is still wanting in the Muratorian Fragment, nor do we yet find the
group there associated with the Acts of the Apostles. The Epistle of Jude, two Epistles of
John, the Wisdom of Solomon, the Apocalypse of John and that of Peter form the unsymmetrical
conclusion of this oldest catalogue of the canon. But, all the same writings, by Jude, John,
and Peter are here found side by side; thus we have a preparation for the future arrangement
made in different though similar fashion by Irenæus and again altered by Tertullian. The genuine
Pauline Epistles appear enclosed on the one hand by the Acts of the Apostles and the Catholic
Epistles, and on the other by the Pastoral ones, which in their way are also "Catholic." That
is the character of the "Catholic" New Testament which is confirmed by the earliest use of
it (in Irenæus and Tertullian). In speaking above of the Acts of the Apostles as a late book,
we meant that it was so relatively to the canon. In itself the book is old and for the most
part reliable.]

[Footnote 95: There is no doubt that this was the reason why to all appearance the innovation
was scarcely felt. Similar causes were at work here as in the case of the apostolic rule of
faith. In the one case the writings that had long been read in the Church formed the basis,
in the other the baptismal confession. But a great distinction is found in the fact that the
baptismal confession, as already settled, afforded an elastic standard which was treated as
a fixed one and was therefore extremely practical; whilst, conversely, the undefined group
of writings hitherto read in the Church was reduced to a collection which could neither be
increased nor diminished.]

[Footnote 96: At the beginning, that is about 180, it was only in practice, and not in theory,
that the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles possessed equal authority. Moreover, the name New
Testament is not yet found in Irenæus, nor do we yet find him giving an exact idea of its content.
See Werner in the Text. u. Unters. z. altchristl. Lit. Gesch. Bd. VI. 2.]

[Footnote 97: See above, p. 40, note 2.]

[Footnote 98: We have ample evidence in the great work of Irenæus as to the difficulties he
found in many passages of the Pauline Epistles, which as yet were almost solely utilised as
sources of doctrine by such men as Marcion, Tatian, and theologians of the school of Valentinus.
The difficulties of course still continued to be felt in the period which followed. (See, e.g.,
Method, Conviv. Orat. III. 1, 2.)]

[Footnote 99: Apollinaris of Hierapolis already regards any contradiction between the (4) Gospels
as impossible. (See Routh, Reliq. Sacr. I. p. 150.)]

[Footnote 100: See Overbeck, "Ueber die Auffassung des Streites des Paulus mit Petrus in Antiochien
bei den Kirchenvätern," 1877, p. 8.]

[Footnote 101: See also Clement Strom. IV. 21. 124; VI. 15. 125. The expression is also frequent
in Origen, e.g., de princip. præf. 4.]

[Footnote 102: The Roman Church in her letter to that of Corinth designates her own words as
the words of God (1 Clem. LIX. 1) and therefore requires obedience "[Greek: tois huph' hêmôn
gegrammenois dia tou hagiou pneumatos]" (LXIII. 2).]

[Footnote 103: Tertull. de exhort. 4: "Spiritum quidem dei etiam fideles habent, sed non omnes
fideles apostoli ... Proprie enim apostoli spiritum sanctum habent, qui plene habent in operibus
prophetiæ et efficacia virtutum documentisque linguarum, non ex parte, quod ceteri." Clem.
Alex. Strom. IV. 21. 135: [Greek: Hekastos idion echei charisma apo theou, ho men houtôs, ho
de houtôs, hoi apostoloi de en pasi peplêromenoi]; Serapion in Euseb., H. E. VI. 12. 3: [Greek:
hêmeis kai ton Petron kai tous allous apostolous apodechometha hôs Christon]. The success of
the canon here referred to was an undoubted blessing, for, as the result of enthusiasm, Christianity
was menaced with complete corruption, and things and ideas, no matter how alien to its spirit,
were able to obtain a lodgment under its protection. The removal of this danger, which was
in some measure averted by the canon, was indeed coupled with great disadvantages, inasmuch
as believers were referred in legal fashion to a new book, and the writings contained in it
were at first completely obscured by the assumption that they were inspired and by the requirement
of an "expositio legitima."]

[Footnote 104: See Tertull., de virg. vol. 4, de resurr. 24, de ieiun. 15, de pudic. 12. Sufficiency
is above all included in the concept "inspiration" (see for ex. Tertull., de monog. 4: "Negat
scriptura quod non notat"), and the same measure of authority belongs to all parts (see Iren.,
IV. 28. 3. "Nihil vacuum neque sine signo apud deum").]

[Footnote 105: The direct designation "prophets" was, however, as a rule, avoided. The conflict
with Montanism made it expedient to refrain from this name; but see Tertullian, adv. Marc.
IV. 24: "Tam apostolus Moyses, quam et apostoli prophetæ."]

[Footnote 106: Compare also what the author of the Muratorian Fragment says in the passage
about the Shepherd of Hermas.]

[Footnote 107: This caused the most decisive breach with tradition, and the estimate to be
formed of the Apocalypses must at first have remained an open question. Their fate was long
undecided in the West; but it was very soon settled that they could have no claim to public
recognition in the Church, because their authors had not that fulness of the Spirit which belongs
to the Apostles alone.]

[Footnote 108: The disputed question as to whether all the acknowledged apostolic writings
were regarded as canonical must be answered in the affirmative in reference to Irenæus and
Tertullian, who conversely regarded no book as canonical unless written by the Apostles. On
the other hand, it appears to me that no certain opinion on this point can be got from the
Muratorian Fragment. In the end the Gospel, Acts, Kerygma, and Apocalypse of Peter as well
as the Acts of Paul were rejected, a proceeding which was at the same time a declaration that
they were spurious. But these three witnesses agree (see also App. Constit. VI. 16) that the
apostolic regula fidei is practically the final court of appeal, inasmuch as it decides whether
a writing is really apostolic or not, and inasmuch as, according to Tertullian, the apostolic
writings belong to the Church alone, because she alone possesses the apostolic regula (de præscr.
37 ff.). The regula of course does not legitimise those writings, but only proves that they
are authentic and do not belong to the heretics. These witnesses also agree that a Christian
writing has no claim to be received into the canon merely on account of its prophetic form.
On looking at the matter more closely, we see that the view of the early Church, as opposed
to Montanism, led to the paradox that the Apostles were prophets in the sense of being inspired
by the Spirit, but that they were not so in the strict sense of the word.]

[Footnote 109: The fragment of Serapion's letter given in Eusebius owes its interest to the
fact that it not only shows the progress made at this time with the formation of the canon
at Antioch, but also what still remained to be done.]

[Footnote 110: See my essay "Theophilus v. Antiochien und das N. T." in the Ztschr. f. K. Gesch.
XI. p. 1 ff.]

[Footnote 111: The most important passages are Autol. II. 9. 22: [Greek: hothen didaskousin
hêmas hai hagiai graphai kai pantes hoi pneumatophoroi, ex hôn Iôannaes legei k.t.l.] (follows
John I. 1) III. 12: [Greek: kai peri dikaiosunês, hês ho nomos eirêken, akoloutha heurisketai
kai ta tôn prophêtôn kai tôn euangeliôn echein, dia to tous pantas pneumatophorous heni pneumati
theou lelalêkenai]; III. 13: [Greek: ho hagios logos--hê euangelios phônê].; III. 14: [Greek:
Êsaias--to de euangelion--ho theios logos]. The latter formula is not a quotation of Epistles
of Paul viewed as canonical, but of a divine command found in the Old Testament and given in
Pauline form. It is specially worthy of note that the original of the six books of the Apostolic
Constitutions, written in Syria and belonging to the second half of the third century, knows
yet of no New Testament. In addition to the Old Testament it has no authority but the "Gospel."]

[Footnote 112: There has as yet been no sufficient investigation of the New Testament of Clement.
The information given by Volkmar in Credner's Gesch. d. N. Tlichen Kanon, p. 382 ff., is not
sufficient. The space at the disposal of this manual prevents me from establishing the results
of my studies on this point. Let me at least refer to some important passages which I have
collected. Strom. I. §§ 28, 100; II. §§ 22, 28, 29; III.,§§ 11, 66, 70, 71, 76, 93, 108; IV.
§§ 2, 91, 97, 105, 130, 133, 134, 138, 159; V. §§ 3, 17, 27, 28, 30, 31, 38, 80, 85, 86; VI.
§§ 42,44, 54, 59, 61, 66--68, 88, 91, 106, 107, 119, 124, 125, 127, 128, 133, 161, 164; VII.
§§ 1, 14, 34, 76, 82, 84, 88, 94, 95, 97, 100, 101, 103, 104, 106, 107. As to the estimate
of the Epistles of Barnabas and Clement of Rome as well as of the Shepherd, in Clement, see
the Prolegg. to my edition of the Opp. Patr. Apost.]

[Footnote 113: According to Strom. V. 14. 138 even the Epicurean Metrodorus uttered certain
words [Greek: entheôs]; but on the other hand Homer was a prophet against his will. See Pæd.
I. 6. 36, also § 51.]

[Footnote 114: In the Pæd. the Gospels are regularly called [Greek: hê graphê] but this is
seldom the case with the Epistles. The word "Apostle" is used in quoting these.]

[Footnote 115: It is also very interesting to note that Clement almost nowhere illustrates
the parabolic character of the Holy Scriptures by quoting the Epistles, but in this connection
employs the Old Testament and the Gospels, just as he almost never allegorises passages from
other writings. 1 Cor. III. 2 is once quoted thus in Pæd. I. 6. 49: [Greek: to en tô apostolô
hagion pneuma tê tou kuriou apochrômenon phônê legei]. We can hardly conclude from Pæd. I.
7. 61 that Clement called Paul a "prophet."]

[Footnote 116: It is worthy of special note that Clem., Pæd. II. 10.3; Strom. II. 15. 67 has
criticised an interpretation given by the author of the Epistle of Barnabas, although he calls
Barnabas an Apostle.]

[Footnote 117: In this category we may also include the Acts of the Apostles, which is perhaps
used like the [Greek: kêrugma]. It is quoted in Pæd. II. 16. 56; Strom. I. 50, 89, 91, 92,
153, 154; III. 49; IV. 97; V. 75, 82; VI. 63, 101, 124, 165.]

[Footnote 118: The "seventy disciples" were also regarded as Apostles, and the authors of writings
the names of which did not otherwise offer a guarantee of authority were likewise included
in this category. That is to say, writings which were regarded as valuable and which for some
reason or other could not be characterised as apostolic in the narrower sense were attributed
to authors whom there was no reason for denying to be Apostles in the wider sense. This wider
use of the concept "apostolic" is moreover no innovation. See my edition of the Didache, pp.
111-118.]

[Footnote 119: The formation of the canon in Alexandria must have had some connection with
the same process in Asia Minor and in Rome. This is shown not only by each Church recognising
four Gospels, but still more by the admission of thirteen Pauline Epistles. We would see our
way more clearly here, if anything certain could be ascertained from the works of Clement,
including the Hypotyposes, as to the arrangement of the Holy Scriptures; but the attempt to
fix this arrangement is necessarily a dubious one, because Clement's "canon of the New Testament"
was not yet finally fixed. It may be compared to a half-finished statue whose bust is already
completely chiselled, while the under parts are still embedded in the stone.]

[Footnote 120: No greater creative act can be mentioned in the whole history of the Church
than the formation of the apostolic collection and the assigning to it of a position of equal
rank with the Old Testament.]

[Footnote 121: The history of early Christian writings in the Church which were not definitely
admitted into the New Testament is instructive on this point. The fate of some of these may
be described as tragical. Even when they were not branded as downright forgeries, the writings
of the Fathers from the fourth century downwards were far preferred to them.]

[Footnote 122: See on this point Overbeck "Abhandlung über die Anfange der patristischen Litteratur,"
l.c., p. 469. Nevertheless, even after the creation of the New Testament canon, theological
authorship was an undertaking which was at first regarded as highly dangerous. See the Antimontanist
in Euseb., H. E. V. 16. 3: [Greek: dediôs kai exeulaboumenos, mê pê doxô prin episungraphein
ê epidiatassesthai tô tês tou euangeliou kainês diathêkês logô]. We find similar remarks in
other old Catholic Fathers (see Clemen. Alex.).]

[Footnote 123: But how diverse were the expositions; compare the exegesis of Origen and Tertullian,
Scorp. II.]

[Footnote 124: On the extent to which the Old Testament had become subordinated to the New
and the Prophets to the Apostles, since the end of the second century, see the following passage
from Novatian, de trinit. 29: "Unus ergo et idem spiritus qui in prophetis et apostolis, nisi
quoniam ibi ad momentum, hic semper. Ceterum ibi non ut semper in illis inesset, hic ut in
illis semper maneret, et ibi mediocriter distributus, hic totus effusus, ibi parce datus, hic
large commodatus."]

[Footnote 125: That may be shown in all the old Catholic Fathers, but most plainly perhaps
in the theology of Origen. Moreover, the subordination of the Old Testament revelation to the
Christian one is not simply a result of the creation of the New Testament, but may be explained
by other causes; see chap. 5. If the New Testament had not been formed, the Church would perhaps
have obtained a Christian Old Testament with numerous interpolations--tendencies in this direction
were not wanting: see vol. I, p. 114 f.--and increased in extent by the admission of apocalypses.
The creation of the New Testament preserved the purity of the Old, for it removed the need
of doing violence to the latter in the interests of Christianity.]

[Footnote 126: The Catholic Church had from the beginning a very clear consciousness of the
dangerousness of many New Testament writings, in fact she made a virtue of necessity in so
far as she set up a theory to prove the unavoidableness of this danger. See Tertullian, de
præscr. passim, and de resurr. 63.]

[Footnote 127: To a certain extent the New Testament disturbs and prevents the tendency to
summarise the faith and reduce it to its most essential content. For it not only puts itself
in the place of the unity of a system, but frequently also in the place of a harmonious and
complete creed. Hence the rule of faith is necessary as a guiding principle, and even an imperfect
one is better than a mere haphazard reliance upon the Bible.]

[Footnote 128: We must not, however, ascribe that to conscious mistrust, for Irenæus and Tertullian
bear very decided testimony against such an idea, but to the acknowledgment that it was impossible
to make any effective use of the New Testament Scriptures in arguments with educated non-Christians
and heretics. For these writings could carry no weight with the former, and the latter either
did not recognise them or else interpreted them by different rules. Even the offer of several
of the Fathers to refute the Marcionites from their own canon must by no means be attributed
to an uncertainty on their part with regard to the authority of the ecclesiastical canon of
Scripture. We need merely add that the extraordinary difficulty originally felt by Christians
in conceiving the Pauline Epistles, for instance, to be analogous and equal in value to Genesis
or the prophets occasionally appears in the terminology even in the third century, in so far
as the term "divine writings" continues to be more frequently applied to the Old Testament
than to certain parts of the New.]

[Footnote 129: Tertullian, in de corona 3, makes his Catholic opponent say: "Etiam in traditionis
obtentu exigenda est auctoritas scripta."]

[Footnote 130: Hatch, Organisation of the early Christian Church, 1883. Harnack, Die Lehre
der zwölf Apostel, 1884. Sohm, Kirchenrecht, Vol. I. 1892.]

[Footnote 131: Marcion was the only one who did not claim to prove his Christianity from traditions
inasmuch as he rather put it in opposition to tradition. This disclaimer of Marcion is in keeping
with his renunciation of apologetic proof, whilst, conversely, in the Church the apologetic
proof, and the proof from tradition adduced against the heretics, were closely related. In
the one case the truth of Christianity was proved by showing that it is the oldest religion,
and in the other the truth of ecclesiastical Christianity was established from the thesis that
it is the oldest Christianity, viz., that of the Apostles.]

[Footnote 132: See Tertullian, de præscr. 20, 21, 32.]

[Footnote 133: This theory is maintained by Irenæus and Tertullian, and is as old as the association
of the [Greek: hagia ekklêsia] and the [Greek: pneuma hagion]. Just for that reason the distinction
they make between Churches founded by the Apostles and those of later origin is of chief value
to themselves in their arguments against heretics. This distinction, it may be remarked, is
clearly expressed in Tertullian alone. Here, for example, it is of importance that the Church
of Carthage derives its "authority" from that of Rome (de præscr. 36).]

[Footnote 134: Tertull., de præscr. 32 (see p. 19). Iren., III. 2. 2: "Cum autem ad eam iterum
traditionem, quæ est ab apostolis, quæ per successiones presbyterorum in ecclesiis custoditur,
provocamus eos, etc." III. 3. 1: "Traditionem itaque apostolorum in toto mundo manifestatam
in omni ecclesia adest perspicere omnibus qui vera velint videre, et habemus annumerare eos,
qui ab apostolis instituti sunt episcopi in ecclesiis et successiones eorum usque ad nos ...
valde enim perfectos in omnibus eos volebant esse, quos et successores relinquebant, suum ipsorum
locum magisterii tradentes ... traditio Romanæ ecclesiæ, quam habet ab apostolis, et annuntiata
hominibus fides per successiones episcoporum perveniens usque ad nos." III. 3. 4, 4. 1: "Si
de aliqua modica qusestione disceptatio esset, nonne oporteret in antiquissimas recurrere ecclesias,
in quibus apostoli conversati sunt ... quid autem si neque apostoli quidem scripturas reliquissent
nobis, nonne oportebat ordinem sequi traditionis, quam tradiderunt iis, quibus committebant
ecclesias?" IV. 33. 8: "Character corporis Christi secundum successiones episcoporum, quibus
apostoli eam quæ in unoquoque loco est ecclesiam tradiderunt, quæ pervenit usque ad nos, etc."
V. 20.1: "Omnes enim ii valde posteriores sunt quam episcopi, quibus apostoli tradiderunt ecclesias."
IV. 26. IV. 26. 5: "Ubi igitur charismata domini posita sunt, ibi discere oportet veritatem,
apud quos est ea quæ est ab apostolis ecclesiæ successio." The declaration in Luke X. 16 was
already applied by Irenæus (III. præf.) to the successors of the Apostles.]

[Footnote 135: For details on this point see my edition of the Didache, Proleg., p. 140. As
the regula fidei has its preparatory stages in the baptismal confession, and the New Testament
in the collection of writings read in the Churches, so the theory that the bishops receive
and guarantee the apostolic heritage of truth has its preparatory stage in the old idea that
God has bestowed on the Church Apostles, prophets, and teachers, who always communicate his
word in its full purity. The functions of these persons devolved by historical development
upon the bishop; but at the same time it became more and more a settled conviction that no
one in this latter period could be compared with the Apostles. The only true Christianity,
however, was that which was apostolic and which could prove itself to be so. The natural result
of the problem which thus arose was the theory of an objective transference of the charisma
veritatis from the Apostles to the bishops. This notion preserved the unique personal importance
of the Apostles, guaranteed the apostolicity, that is, the truth of the Church's faith, and
formed a dogmatic justification for the authority already attained by the bishops. The old
idea that God bestows his Spirit on the Church, which is therefore the holy Church, was ever
more and more transformed into the new notion that the bishops receive this Spirit, and that
it appears in their official authority. The theory of a succession of prophets, which can be
proved to have existed in Asia Minor, never got beyond a rudimentary form and speedily disappeared.]

[Footnote 136: This theory must have been current in the Roman Church before the time when
Irenæus wrote; for the list of Roman bishops, which we find in Irenæus and which he obtained
from Rome, must itself be considered as a result of that dogmatic theory. The first half of
the list must have been concocted, as there were no monarchical bishops in the strict sense
in the first century (see my treatise: "Die ältesten christlichen Datirungen und die Anfänge
einer bischoflichen Chronographie in Rom." in the report of the proceedings of the Royal Prussian
Academy of Science, 1892, p. 617 ff). We do not know whether such lists were drawn up so early
in the other churches of apostolic origin (Jerusalem?). Not till the beginning of the 3rd century
have we proofs of that being done, whereas the Roman community, as early as Soter's time, had
a list of bishops giving the duration of each episcopate. Nor is there any evidence before
the 3rd century of an attempt to invent such a list for Churches possessing no claim to have
been founded by Apostles.]

[Footnote 137: We do not yet find this assertion in Tertullian's treatise "de præscr."]

[Footnote 138: Special importance attaches to Tertullian's treatise "de pudicitia," which has
not been sufficiently utilised to explain the development of the episcopate and the pretensions
at that time set up by the Roman bishop. It shows clearly that Calixtus claimed for himself
as bishop the powers and rights of the Apostles in their full extent, and that Tertullian did
not deny that the "doctrina apostolorum" was inherent in his office, but merely questioned
the "potestas apostolorum." It is very significant that Tertullian (c. 21) sneeringly addressed
him as "apostolice" and reminded him that "ecclesia spiritus, non ecclesia numerus episcoporum."
What rights Calixtus had already claimed as belonging to the apostolic office may be ascertained
from Hippol. Philos. IX. 11. 12. But the introduction to the Philosophoumena proves that Hippolytus
himself was at one with his opponent in supposing that the bishops, as successors of the Apostles,
had received the attributes of the latter: [Greek: Tas haireseis heteros ouk elegxei, ê to
en ekklêsia paradothen hagion pneuma, ou tuchontes proteroi hoi apostoloi metedosan tois orthôs
pepisteukosin hôn hêmeis diadochoi tugchanontes tês te autês charitos metechontes archierateias
te kai didaskalias kai phrouroi tês ekklêsias lelogismenoi ouk ophthalmô nustazomen, oude logon
orthon siôpômen, k.t.l.] In these words we have an immense advance beyond the conception of
Irenæus. This advance, of course, was first made in practice, and the corresponding theory
followed. How greatly the prestige and power of the bishops had increased in the first 3rd
part of the 3rd century may be seen by comparing the edict of Maximinus Thrax with the earlier
ones (Euseb., H. E. VI. 28; see also the genuine Martyr. Jacobi, Mariani, etc., in Numidia
c. 10 [Ruinart, Acta mart. p. 272 edit. Ratisb.]): "Nam ita inter se nostræ religionis gradus
artifex sævitia diviserat, ut laicos clericis separatos tentationibus sæculi et terroribus
suis putaret esse cessuros" (that is, the heathen authorities also knew that the clergy formed
the bond of union in the Churches). But the theory that the bishops were successors of the
Apostles, that is, possessed the apostolic office, must be considered a Western one which was
very slowly and gradually adopted in the East. Even in the original of the first six books
of the Apostolic Constitutions, composed about the end of the 3rd century, which represents
the bishop as mediator, king, and teacher of the community, the episcopal office is not yet
regarded as the apostolic one. It is rather presbyters, as in Ignatius, who are classed with
the Apostles. It is very important to note that the whole theory of the significance of the
bishop in determining the truth of ecclesiastical Christianity is completely unknown to Clement
of Alexandria. As we have not the slightest evidence that his conception of the Church was
of a hierarchical and anti-heretical type, so he very rarely mentions the ecclesiastical officials
in his works and rarest of all the bishops. These do not at all belong to his conception of
the Church, or at least only in so far as they resemble the English orders (cf. Pæd. III. 12.
97, presbyters, bishops, deacons, widows; Strom. VII. 1. 3; III. 12. 90, presbyters, deacons,
laity; VI. 13. 106, presbyters, deacons: VI. 13. 107, bishops, presbyters, deacons: Quis dives
42, bishops and presbyters). On the other hand, according to Clement, the true Gnostic has
an office like that of the Apostles. See Strom. VI. 13. 106, 107: [Greek: exestin oun kai nun
tais kyriakais enaskêsantas entolais kata to euangelion teleiôs biôsantas kai gnôstikôs eis
tên eklogên tôn apostolôn engraphênai houtos presbuteros esti tô onti tês ekklêsias kai diakonos
alêthês tês tou theou boulêseôs]. Here we see plainly that the servants of the earthly Church,
as such, have nothing to do with the true Church and the heavenly hierarchy. Strom VII. 9,
52 says: the true Gnostic is the mediator with God. In Strom. VI. 14. 108; VII. 12. 77 we find
the words: [Greek: ho gnôstikos houtos sunelonti eipein tên apostolikên apousian antanaplêroi,
k.t.l.] Clement could not have expressed himself in this way if the office of bishop had at
that time been as much esteemed in the Alexandrian Church, of which he was a presbyter, as
it was at Rome and in other Churches of the West (see Bigg l.c. 101). According to Clement
the Gnostic as a teacher has the same significance as is possessed by the bishop in the West;
and according to him we may speak of a natural succession of teachers. Origen in the main still
held the same view as his predecessor. But numerous passages in his works and above all his
own history shew that in his day the episcopate had become stronger in Alexandria also, and
had begun to claim the same attributes and rights as in the West (see besides de princip. præf.
2: "servetur ecclesiastica prædicatio per successionis ordinem ab apostolis tradita et usque
ad præsens in ecclesiis permanens: illa sola credenda est veritas, quæ in nullo ab ecclesiastica
et apostolica discordat traditione"--so in Rufinus, and in IV. 2. 2: [Greek: tou kanonos tês
Iêsou Christou kata diadochên t. apostolôn ouraniou ekklêsias]). The state of things here is
therefore exactly the same as in the case of the apostolic regula fidei and the apostolic canon
of scripture. Clement still represents an earlier stage, whereas by Origen's time the revolution
has been completed. Wherever this was so, the theory that the monarchical episcopate was based
on apostolic institution was the natural result. This idea led to the assumption--which, however,
was not an immediate consequence in all cases--that the apostolic office, and therefore the
authority of Jesus Christ himself, was continued in the episcopate: "Manifesta est sententia
Iesu Christi apostolos suos mittentis et ipsis solis potestatem a patre sibi datam permittentis,
quibus nos successimus eadem potestatex ecclesiam domini gubernantes et credentium fidem baptizantes"

[Footnote 141: See vol. I. p. 150 f. Special note should be given to the teachings in the Shepherd,
in the 2nd Epistle of Clement and in the [Greek: Didachê].]

[Footnote 142: This notion lies at the basis of the exhortations of Ignatius. He knows nothing
of an empirical union of the different communities into one Church guaranteed by any law or
office. The bishop is of importance only for the individual community, and has nothing to do
with the essence of the Church; nor does Ignatius view the separate communities as united in
any other way than by faith, charity, and hope. Christ, the invisible Bishop, and the Church
are inseparably connected (ad Ephes. V. 1; as well as 2nd Clem. XIV.), and that is ultimately
the same idea, as is expressed in the associating of [Greek: pneuma] and [Greek: ekklêsia].
But every individual community is an image of the heavenly Church, or at least ought to be.]

[Footnote 143: The expression "Catholic Church" appears first in Ignatius (ad Smyrn. VIII.
2): [Greek: hopou an phanêi ho episkopos, ekei to plêthos esto; hôsper hopou an ê Christos
Iêsous, ekei hê katholikê ekklêsia]. But in this passage these words do not yet express a new
conception of the Church, which represents her as an empirical commonwealth. Only the individual
earthly communities exist empirically, and the universal, i.e., the whole Church, occupies
the same position towards these as the bishops of the individual communities do towards the
Lord. The epithet "[Greek: katholikos]" does not of itself imply any secularisation of the
idea of the Church.]

[Footnote 144: The expression "invisible Church" is liable to be misunderstood here, because
it is apt to impress us as a mere idea, which is certainly not the meaning attached to it in
the earliest period.]

[Footnote 145: It was thus regarded by Hegesippus in whom the expression "[Greek: hê henôsis
tês ekklêsias]" is first found. In his view the [Greek: ekklêsia] is founded on the [Greek:
orthos logos] transmitted by the Apostles. The innovation does not consist in the emphasis
laid upon faith, for the unity of faith was always supposed to be guaranteed by the possession
of the one Spirit and the same hope, but in the setting up of a formulated creed, which resulted
in a loosening of the connection between faith and conduct. The transition to the new conception
of the Church was therefore a gradual one. The way is very plainly prepared for it in 1 Tim.
III. 15: [Greek: oikos theou ekklêsia, stulos kai hedraiôma tês alêtheias].]

[Footnote 146: The oldest predicate which was given to the Church and which was always associated
with it, was that of holiness. See the New Testament; Barn. XIV. 6; Hermas, Vis. I. 3, 4; I.
6; the Roman symbol; Dial. 119; Ignat. ad Trail, inscr.; Theophil. ad Autol., II. 14 (here
we have even the plural, "holy churches"); Apollon. in Euseb, H. E. V. 18. 5; Tertull., adv.
Marc. IV. 13; V. 4; de pudicit. 1; Mart. Polyc inscr.; Alexander Hieros. in Euseb., H. E. VI.
11. 5; Clemens Alex.; Cornelius in Euseb., VI. 43. 6; Cyprian. But the holiness (purity) of
the Church was already referred by Hegesippus (Euseb., H. E. IV. 22. 4) to its pure doctrine:
[Greek: ekaloun tên ekklêsian parthenon; oupô gar ephtharto akoais mataiais]. The unity of
the Church according to Hegesippus is specially emphasised in the Muratorian Fragment (line
55): see also Hermas; Justin; Irenæus; Tertullian, de præscr. 20; Clem. Alex., Strom. VII.
17. 107. Even before Irenæus and Tertullian the universality of the Church was emphasised for
apologetic purposes. In so far as universality is a proof of truth, "universal" is equivalent
to "orthodox." This signification is specially clear in expressions like: [Greek: hê en Smurnê
katholikê ekklêsia] (Mart. Polyc. XVI. 2). From Irenæus, III. 15, 2, we must conclude that
the Valentinians called their ecclesiastical opponents "Catholics." The word itself is not
yet found in Irenæus, but the idea is there (see I. 10. 2; II. 9. 1, etc., Serapion in Euseb.,
H.E. V. 19: [Greek: pasa hê en kosmô adelphotês]). [Greek: Katholikos] is found as a designation
of the orthodox, visible Church in Mart. Polyc. inscr.: [Greek: hai kata panta topon tês hagias
katholikês ekklêsias paroikiai]; 19. 2; 16. 2 (in all these passages, however, it is probably
an interpolation, as I have shown in the "Expositor" for Dec. 1885, p. 410 f); in the Muratorian
Fragment 61, 66, 69; in the anonymous writer in Euseb., H. E. V. 16. 9. in Tertull. frequently,
e.g., de præscr. 26, 30; adv. Marc. III. 22: IV. 4; in Clem. Alex., Strom. VII. 17. 106, 107;
in Hippol. Philos. IX. 12; in Mart. Pionii 2, 9, 13, 19; in Cornelius in Cypr., epp. 49. 2;
and in Cyprian. The expression "catholica traditio" occurs in Tertull., de monog. 2, "fides
catholica" in Cyprian ep. 25, "[Greek: kanôn katholikos]" in the Mart. Polyc. rec. Mosq. fin.
and Cypr. ep. 70. 1, "catholica fides et religio" in the Mart. Pionii 18. In the earlier Christian
literature the word [Greek: katholikos] occurs in various connections in the following passages:
in fragments of the Peratae (Philos. V. 16), and in Herakleon, e.g. in Clement, Strom. IV.
9. 71; in Justin, Dial., 81, 102; Athenag., 27; Theophil. I. 13; Pseudojustin, de monarch.
1, ([Greek: kathol. doxa]); Iren., III. 11, 8; Apollon. in Euseb., H. E. IV. 18 5, Tertull.,
de fuga 3; adv. Marc. II. 17; IV. 9; Clement, Strom, IV. 15. 97; VI. 6. 47; 7. 57; 8. 67. The
addition "catholicam" found its way into the symbols of the West only at a comparatively late
period. The earlier expressions for the whole of Christendom are [Greek: pasai hai ekklêsiai,
ekklêsiai kata pasan polin, ekklêsiai en kosmô, hai huph' ouranou], etc.]

[Footnote 147: Very significant is Tertullian's expression in adv. Val. 4: "Valentinus de ecclesia
authenticæ regulæ abrupit," (but probably this still refers specially to the Roman Church).]

[Footnote 148: Tertullian called the Church mother (in Gal. IV. 26 the heavenly Jerusalem is
called "mother"); see de oral. 2: "ne mater quidem ecclesia pixeterhur," de monog. 7; adv.
Marc. V. 4 (the author of the letter in Euseb., H. E. V. 2. 7, 1. 45, had already done this
before him). In the African Church the symbol was thus worded soon after Tertullian's time:
"credis in remissionem peccatorum et vitam æsternam per sanctam ecclesiam" (see Hahn, Bibliothek
der Symbole, 2nd ed. p. 29 ff.) On the other hand Clement of Alexandria (Strom. VI. 16. 146)
rejected the designation of the Church, as "mother": [Greek: mêtêr de ouch, hôs tines ekdedôkasin,
hê ekklêsia, all' hê theia gnôsis kai hê sophia] (there is a different idea in Pæd. I. 5. 21.
and 6. 42: [Greek: mêtêr parthenos; ekklêsian emoi philon autên kalein]). In the Acta Justini
c. 4 the faith is named "mother."]

[Footnote 149: Hippol. Philos. IX. 12 p. 460.]

[Footnote 150: The phraseology of Irenæus is very instructive here. As a rule he still speaks
of Churches (in the plural) when he means the empirical Church. It is already otherwise with
Tertullian, though even with him the old custom still lingers.]

[Footnote 151: The most important passages bearing on this are II. 31. 3: III. 24. 1 (see the
whole section, but especially: "in ecclesia posuit deus universam operationem spiritus; cuius
non sunt participes omnes qui non concurrunt ad ecclesiam ... ubi enim ecclesia, ibi et spiritus
dei, et ubi spiritus dei, illic ecclesia et omnis gratia"); III.11. 8: [Greek: stulos kai stêrigma
ekklêsias to euangelion kai pneuma zôês]: IV. 8. 1: "semen Abrahæ ecclesia", IV. 8. 3: "omnes
iusti sacerdotalem habent ordinem;" IV. 36. 2: "ubique præclara est ecclesia; ubique enim sunt
qui suscipiunt spiritum;" IV. 33. 7: [Greek: ekklêsia mega kai endoxon sôma tou Christou];
IV. 26. 1 sq.: V. 20. 1.: V. 32.: V. 34. 3., "Levitae et sacerdotes sunt discipuli omnes domini."]

[Footnote 152: Hence the repudiation of all those who separate themselves from the Catholic
Church (III. 11. 9; 24. 1: IV. 26. 2; 33. 7).]

[Footnote 153: On IV. 33. 7 see Seeberg, l.c., p. 20, who has correctly punctuated the passage,
but has weakened its force. The fact that Irenæus was here able to cite the "antiquus ecclesiæ
status in universo mundo et character corporis Christi secundum successiones episcoporum,"
etc., as a second and independent item alongside of the apostolic doctrine is, however, a proof
that the transition from the idea of the Church, as a community united by a common faith, to
that of a hierarchical institution was already revealing itself in his writings.]

[Footnote 154: The Church as a communion of the same faith, that is of the same doctrine, is
spoken of in de præscr. 20; de virg. vol. 2. On the other hand we find the ideal spiritual
conception in de bapt. 6: "ubi tres, id est pater et filius et spiritus sanctus, ibi ecclesia,
quæ trium corpus est;" 8: "columba s. spiritus advolat, pacem dei adferens, emissa de coelis,
ubi ecclesia est arca figurata;" 15: "unus deus et unum baptismum et una ecclesia in coelis;"
de pænit. 10: "in uno et altero ecclesia est, ecclesia vero Christus;" de orat. 28: "nos sumus
veri adoratores et veri sacerdotes, qui spiritu orantes spiritu sacrificamus;" Apolog. 39;
de exhort. 7: "differentiam inter ordinem et plebem constituit ecclesiæ auctoritas et honor
per ordinis consessum sanctificatus. Adeo ubi ecclesiastici ordinis non est consessus, et offers
et tinguis et sacerdos es tibi solus. Sed ubi tres, ecclesia est, licet laici" (the same idea,
only not so definitely expressed, is already found in de bapt. 17); de monog. 7: "nos autem
Iesus summus sacerdos sacerdotes deo patri suo fecit ... vivit unicus pater noster deus et
mater ecclesia, ... certe sacerdotes sumus a Christo vocati;" 12; de pudic. 21: "nam et ipsa
ecclesia proprie et principaliter ipse est spiritus, in quo est trinitas unius divinitatis,
pater et filius et spiritus sanctus. Illam ecclesiam congregat quam dominus in tribus posuit.
Atque ita exinde etiam numerus omnis qui in hanc fidem conspiraverint ecclesia ab auctore et
consecratore censetur. Et ideo ecclesia quidem delicta donabit, sed ecclesia spiritus per spiritalem
hominem, non ecclesia numerus episcoporum;" de anima 11, 21. Contradictions in detail need
not surprise us in Tertullian, since his whole position as a Catholic and as a Montanist is
contradictory.]

[Footnote 155: The notion that the true Gnostic can attain the same position as the Apostles
also preserved Clement from thrusting the ideal conception of the Church into the background.]

[Footnote 156: Some very significant remarks are found in Clement about the Church which is
the object of faith. See Pæd. I. 5. 18, 21; 6. 27: [Greek: hôs gar thelêma tou Theou ergon
esti kai touto kosmos onomazetai, houtô kai to boulêma autou anthrôpôn esti sôtêria, kai touto
ekklêsia keklêtai]--here an idea which Hermas had in his mind (see Vol. I., p. 180. note 4)
is pregnantly and excellently expressed. Strom. II. 12. 55; IV. 8. 66: [Greek: eikôn tês ouraniou
ekklêsias hê epigeios, dioper euchometha kai epi gês genesthai to thelêma tou Theou hôs en
ouranô]; IV. 26. 172: [Greek: hê ekklêsia hupo logou apoliorkêtos aturannêtos polis epi gês,
thelêma theion epi gês, hôs en ouranô]; VI. 13. 106, 107; VI. 14. 108: [Greek: hê anôtatô ekklêsia,
kath' hên hoi philosophoi sunagontai tou Theou]; VII. 5. 29: [Greek: pôs ou kurios tên eis
timên tou Theou kat' epignôsin hagian genomenên ekklêsian hieron an eipoimen Theou to pollou
axion ... ou gar nun ton topon, alla to athroisma tôn eklektôn ekklêsian kalô]; VII. 6. 32;
VII. 11. 68: [Greek: hê pneumatikê ekklêsia]. The empirical conception of the Church is most
clearly formulated in VII. 17. 107; we may draw special attention to the following sentences:
[Greek: phaneron oimai gegenêsthai mian einai tên alêthê ekklêsian tên tôi onti archaian, eis
hên hoi kata prothesin dikaioi egkatalegontai, henos gar ontos tou Theou kai henos tou kuriou
... tê goun tou henos phusei sunklêrountai ekklêsia hê mia, hên eis pollas katatemnein biazontai
haireseis].]

[Footnote 157: It may, however, be noted that the old eschatological aim has fallen into the
background in Clement's conception of the Church.]

[Footnote 158: A significance of this kind is suggested by the notion that the orders in the
earthly Church correspond to those in the heavenly one; but this idea, which afterwards became
so important in the East, was turned to no further account by Clement. In his view the "Gnostics"
are the highest stage in the Church. See Bigg, l.c., p. 100.]

[Footnote 159: De princip. IV. 2, 2: [Greek: hê ouranios ekklêsia]; Hom. IX. in Exod. c. 3:
"ecclesia credentium plebs;" Hom. XI. in Lev. c. 5; Hom. VI. in Lev. c. 5; ibid. Hom. IX.:
"omni ecclesiæ dei et credentium populo sacerdotium datum.": T. XIV. in Mt. c. 17: c. Cels.
VI. 48: VI. 79; Hom. VII. in Lk.; and de orat. 31 a twofold Church is distinguished ([Greek:
hôste einai epi tôn hagiôn sunathroizomenôn diplên ekklêsian tên men anthrôpôn, tên de angelôn]).
Nevertheless Origen does not assume two Churches, but, like Clement, holds that there is only
one, part of which is already in a state of perfection and part still on earth. But it is worthy
of note that the ideas of the heavenly hierarchy are already more developed in Origen (de princip.
I. 7). He adopted the old speculation about the origin of the Church (see Papias, fragm. 6;
2 Clem. XIV.). Socrates (H. E. III. 7) reports that Origen, in the 9th vol. of his commentary
on Genesis, compared Christ with Adam and Eve with the Church, and remarks that Pamphilus'
apology for Origen stated that this allegory was not new: [Greek: ou prôton Ôrigenên epi tautên
tên pragmateian elthein phasin, alla tên tês ekklêsias mustikên hermêneusai paradosin]. A great
many more of these speculations are to be found in the 3rd century. See, e.g., the Acts of
Peter and Paul 29.]

[Footnote 160: De princip. IV. 2. 2; Hom. III. in Jesu N. 5: "nemo tibi persuadeat, nemo semetipsum
decipiat: extra ecclesiam nemo salvatur." The reference is to the Catholic Church which Origen
also calls [Greek: to holon sôma tôn sunagôgôn tês ekklêsias.]]

[Footnote 161: Hermas (Sim. I.) has spoken of the "city of God" (see also pseudo-Cyprian's
tractate "de pascha computus"); but for him it lies in Heaven and is the complete contrast
of the world. The idea of Plato here referred to is to be found in his Republic.]

[Footnote 162: See c. Cels. VIII. 68-75.]

[Footnote 163: Comment. in Joh. VI. 38.]

[Footnote 164: Accordingly he often speaks in a depreciatory way of the [Greek: ochlos tês
ekklêsias] (the ignorant) without accusing them of being unchristian (this is very frequent
in the books c. Cels., but is also found elsewhere).]

[Footnote 165: Origen, who is Augustine's equal in other respects also, and who anticipated
many of the problems considered by the latter, anticipated prophetically this Father's view
of the City of God--of course as a hope (c. Cels. viii. 68 f). The Church is also viewed as
[Greek: to kata Theon politeuma] in Euseb., H. E. V. Præf. § 4, and at an earlier period in
Clement.]

[Footnote 166: This was not done even by Origen, for in his great work "de principiis" we find
no section devoted to the Church.]

[Footnote 167: It is frequently represented in Protestant writers that the mistake consisted
in this identification, whereas, if we once admit this criticism, the defect is rather to be
found in the development itself which took place in the Church, that is, in its secularisation.
No one thought of the desperate idea of an invisible Church; this notion would probably have
brought about a lapse from pure Christianity far more rapidly than the idea of the Holy Catholic
Church.]

[Footnote 168: Both repeatedly and very decidedly declared that the unity of faith (the rule
of faith) is sufficient for the unity of the Church, and that in other things there must be
freedom (see above all Tertull., de orat., de bapt., and the Montanist writings). It is all
the more worthy of note that, in the case of a question in which indeed the customs of the
different countries were exceedingly productive of confusion, but which was certainly not a
matter of faith, it was again a bishop of Rome, and that as far back as the 2nd century, who
first made the observance of the Roman practice a condition of the unity of the Church and
treated nonconformists as heterodox (Victor; see Euseb., H. E. V. 24). On the other hand Irenæus
says: [Greek: hê diaphônia tês nêsteias tên homonoian tês pisteôs sunistêsi].]

[Footnote 169: On Calixtus see Hippolyt., Philos. IX. I2; and Tertull., de pudic.]

[Footnote 170: See on the other hand Tertull., de monog., but also Hippol., l.c.]

[Footnote 171: Cyprian's idea of the Church, an imitation of the conception of a political
empire, viz., one great aristocratically governed state with an ideal head, is the result of
the conflicts through which he passed. It is therefore first found in a complete form in the
treatise "de unitate ecclesiæ" and, above all, in his later epistles (Epp. 43 sq. ed. Hartel).
The passages in which Cyprian defines the Church as "constituta in episcopo et in clero et
in omnibus credentibus" date from an earlier period, when he himself essentially retained the
old idea of the subject. Moreover, he never regarded those elements as similar and of equal
value. The limitation of the Church to the community ruled by bishops was the result of the
Novatian crisis. The unavoidable necessity of excluding orthodox Christians from the ecclesiastical
communion, or, in other words, the fact that such orthodox Christians had separated themselves
from the majority guided by the bishops, led to the setting up of a new theory of the Church,
which therefore resulted from stress of circumstances just as much as the antignostic conception
of the matter held by Irenæus. Cyprian's notion of the relation between the whole body of the
Church and the episcopate may, however, be also understood as a generalisation of the old theory
about the connection between the individual community and the bishop. This already contained
an oecumenical element, for, in fact, every separate community was regarded as a copy of the
one Church, and its bishop therefore as the representative of God (Christ).]

[Footnote 172: We need only quote one passage here--but see also epp. 69. 3, 7 sq.: 70. 2:
73. 8--ep. 55. 24: "Quod vero ad Novatiani personam pertinet, scias nos primo in loco nec curiosos
esse debere quid ille doceat, cum foris doceat; quisquis ille est et qualiscunque est, christianus
non est, qui in Christi ecclesia non est." In the famous sentence (ep. 74. 7; de unit. Cyprian
is fond of referring to Korah's faction, who nevertheless held the same faith as Moses.]

[Footnote 173: Epp. 4. 4: 33. 1: "ecclesia super episcopos constituta;" 43. 5: 45. 3: "unitatem
a domino et per apostolos nobis successoribus traditam;" 46. 1: 66. 8: "scire debes episcopum
in ecclesia esse et ecclesiam in episcopo et si qui cum episcopo non sit in ecclesia non esse;"
de unit. 4.]

[Footnote 174: According to Cyprian the bishops are the sacerdotes [Greek: kat' eksochên] and
the iudices vice Christi. See epp. 59. 5: 66. 3 as well as c. 4: "Christus dicit ad apostolos
ac per hoc ad omnes præpositos, qui apostolis vicaria ordinatione succedunt: qui audit vos
me audit." Ep. 3. 3: "dominus apostolos, i.e., episcopos elegit"; ep. 75. 16.]

[Footnote 175: That is a fundamental idea and in fact the outstanding feature of the treatise
"de unitate." The heretics and schismatics lack love, whereas the unity of the Church is the
product of love, this being the main Christian virtue. That is the ideal thought on which Cyprian
builds his theory (see also epp. 45. 1: 55. 24: 69. 1 and elsewhere), and not quite wrongly,
in so far as his purpose was to gather and preserve, and not scatter. The reader may also recall
the early Christian notion that Christendom should be a band of brethren ruled by love. But
this love ceases to have any application to the case of those who are disobedient to the authority
of the bishop and to Christians of the sterner sort. The appeal which Catholicism makes to
love, even at the present day, in order to justify its secularised and tyrannical Church, turns
in the mouth of hierarchical politicians into hypocrisy, of which one would like to acquit
a man of Cyprian's stamp.]

[Footnote 176: Ep. 43. 5: 55. 24: "episcopatus unus episcoporum multorum concordi numerositate
diffusus;" de unit. 5: "episcopatus unus est, cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur." Strictly
speaking Cyprian did not set up a theory that the bishops were directed by the Holy Spirit,
but in identifying Apostles and bishops and asserting the divine appointment of the latter
he took for granted their special endowment with the Holy Spirit. Moreover, he himself frequently
appealed to special communications he had received from the Spirit as aids in discharging his
official duties.]

[Footnote 177: Cyprian did not yet regard uniformity of Church practice as a matter of moment--or
rather he knew that diversities must be tolerated. In so far as the concordia episcoporum was
consistent with this diversity, he did not interfere with the differences, provided the regula
fidei was adhered to. Every bishop who adheres to the confederation has the greatest freedom
even in questions of Church discipline and practice (as for instance in the baptismal ceremonial);
see ep. 59. 14: "Singulis pastoribus portio gregis est adscripta, quam regit unusquisque et
gubernat rationem sui actus domino redditurus;" 55. 21: "Et quidem apud antecessores nostros
quidam de episcopis istic in provincia nostra dandam pacis moechis non putaverunt et in totum
pænitentiæ locum contra adulteria cluserunt, non tamen a co-episcoporum suorum collegio recesserunt
aut catholicæ ecclesiæ unitatem ruperunt, ut quia apud alios adulteris pax dabatur, qui non
dabat de ecclesia separaretur." According to ep. 57. 5 Catholic bishops, who insist on the
strict practice of penance, but do not separate themselves from the unity of the Church, are
left to the judgment of God. It is different in the case referred to in ep. 68, for Marcion
had formally joined Novatian. Even in the disputed question of heretical baptism (ep. 72. 3)
Cyprian declares to Stephen (See 69. 17: 73. 26; Sententiæ episc., præfat.): "qua in re nec
nos vim cuiquam facimus aut legem damus, quando habeat in ecclesiæ administratione voluntatis
suæ arbitrium liberum unusquisque præpositus, rationem actus sui domino redditurus." It is
therefore plain wherein the unity of the episcopate and the Church actually consists; we may
say that it is found in the regula, in the fixed purpose not to give up the unity in spite
of all differences, and in the principle of regulating all the affairs of the Church "ad originem
dominicam et ad evangelicam adque apostolicam traditionem" (ep. 74. 10). This refers to the
New Testament, which Cyprian emphatically insisted on making the standard for the Church. It
must be taken as the guide, "si in aliquo in ecclesia nutaverit et vacillaverit veritas;" by
it, moreover, all false customs are to be corrected. In the controversy about heretical baptism,
the alteration of Church practice in Carthage and Africa, which was the point in question--for
whilst in Asia heretical baptism had for a very long time been declared invalid (see ep. 75.
19) this had only been the case in Carthage for a few years--was justified by Cyprian through
an appeal to veritas in contrast to consuetudo sine veritate. See epp. 71. 2, 3: 73. 13, 23:
74. 2 sq.: 9 (the formula originates with Tertullian; see de virg. vel. 1-3). The veritas,
however, is to be learned from the Gospel and words of the Apostles: "Lex evangelii," "præcepta
dominica," and synonymous expressions are very frequent in Cyprian, more frequent than reference
to the regula or to the symbol. In fact there was still no Church dogmatic, there being only
principles of Christian faith and life, which, however, were taken from the Holy Scriptures
and the regula.]

[Footnote 178: Cyprian no longer makes any distinction between Churches founded by Apostles,
and those which arose later (that is, between their bishops).]

[Footnote 179: The statement that the Church is "super Petrum fundata" is very frequently made
by Cyprian (we find it already in Tertullian, de monog.); see de habitu virg. 10; Epp. 59.
7: 66. 8: 71. 3: 74. 11: 73. 7. But on the strength of Matth. XVI. he went still farther; see
ep. 43. 5: "deus unus est et Christus unus et una ecclesia et cathedra una super Petrum domini
voce fundata;" ep. 48. 3 (ad Cornel.): "communicatio tua, id est catholicæ ecclesiæ unitas
pariter et caritas;" de unit. 4: "superunum ædificat ecclesiam, et quamvis apostolis omnibus
post resurrectionem suam parem potestatem tribuat, tamen ut unitatem manifestaret, unitatis
eiusdem originem ab uno incipientem sua auctoritate disposuit;" ep. 70. 3: "una ecclesia a
Christo domino nostro super Petrum origine unitatis et ratione fundata" ("with regard to the
origin and constitution of the unity" is the translation of this last passage in the "Stimmen
aus Maria Laach," 1877, part 8, p. 355; but "ratio" cannot mean that); ep. 73. The most emphatic
passages are ep. 48. 3, where the Roman Church is called "matrix et radix ecclesiæ catholicæ"
(the expression "radix et mater" in ep. 45. I no doubt also refers to her), and ep. 59. 30.
2, 3: 60. 2), ad quos perfidia habere non possit accessum." We can see most clearly from epp.
67. 5 and 68 what rights were in point of fact exercised by the bishop of Rome. But the same
Cyprian says quite naively, even at the time when he exalted the Roman cathedra so highly (ep.
52. 2), "quoniam pro magnitudine sua debeat Carthaginem Roma præcedere." In the controversy
about heretical baptism Stephen like Calixtus (Tertull., de pudic. 1) designated himself, on
the ground of the successio Petri and by reference to Matth. XVI., in such a way that one might
suppose he wished to be regarded as "episcopus episcoporum" (Sentent. episc. in Hartel I.,
p. 436). He expressly claimed a primacy and demanded obedience from the "ecclesiæ novellæ et
posteræ" (ep. 71. 3). Like Victor he endeavoured to enforce the Roman practice "tyrannico terrore"
and insisted that the unitas ecclesiæ required the observance of this Church's practice in
all communities. But Cyprian opposed him in the most decided fashion, and maintained the principle
that every bishop, as a member of the episcopal confederation based on the regula and the Holy
Scriptures, is responsible for his practice to God alone. This he did in a way which left no
room for any special and actual authority of the Roman see alongside of the others. Besides,
he expressly rejected the conclusions drawn by Stephen from the admittedly historical position
of the Roman see (ep. 71. 3): "Petrus non sibi vindicavit aliquid insolenter aut adroganter
adsumpsit, ut diceret se principatum tenere et obtemperari a novellis et posteris sibi potius
oportere." Firmilian, ep. 75, went much farther still, for he indirectly declares the successio
Petri claimed by Stephen to be of no importance (c. 17), and flatly denies that the Roman Church
has preserved the apostolic tradition in a specially faithful way. See Otto Ritschl, l.c.,
pp. 92 ff., 110-141. In his conflict with Stephen Cyprian unmistakably took up a position inconsistent
with his former views as to the significance of the Roman see for the Church, though no doubt
these were ideas he had expressed at a critical time when he stood shoulder to shoulder with
the Roman bishop Cornelius.]

[Footnote 182: The gradual union of the provincial communities into one Church may be studied
in a very interesting way in the ecclesiastical Fasti (records, martyrologies, calendars, etc.),
though these studies are as yet only in an incipient stage. See De Rossi, Roma Sotter, the
Bollandists in the 12th vol. for October; Stevenson, Studi in Italia (1879), pp. 439, 458;
the works of Nilles; Egli, Altchristl. Studien 1887 (Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1887, no. 13): Duchesne,
Les sources du Martyrol. Hieron. Rome 1885, but above all the latter's study: Mémoire sur l'origine
des diocèses épiscopaux dans l'ancienne Gaule, 1890. The history of the unification of liturgies
from the 4th century should also be studied.]

[Footnote 183: There were communities in the latter half of the 3rd century, which can be proved
to have been outside the confederation, although in perfect harmony with it in point of belief
(see the interesting case in Euseb., H. E. VII. 24. 6). Conversely, there were Churches in
the confederation whose faith did not in all respects correspond with the Catholic regula as
already expounded. But the fact that it was not the dogmatic system, but the practical constitution
and principles of the Church, as based on a still elastic creed, which formed the ultimate
determining factor, was undoubtedly a great gain; for a system of dogmatics developed beyond
the limits of the Christian kerygma can only separate. Here, however, all differences of faith
had of couise to be glossed over, for the demand of Apelles: [Greek: mê dein holôs exetazein
ton logon, all' ekaston. hôs pepisteuke, diamenein sôthêsesthai gar tous epi ton hestaurômenon
êlpikotas, k.t.l.], was naturally regarded as inadmissible.]

[Footnote 184: Hence we need not be surprised to find that the notion of heresy which arose
in the Church was immediately coupled with an estimate of it, which for injustice and harshness
could not possibly be surpassed in succeeding times. The best definition is in Tertull., de
præscr. 6: "Nobis nihil ex nostro arbitrio indulgere licet, sed nec eligere quod aliquis de
arbitrio suo induxerit. Apostolos domini habemus auctores, qui nec ipsi quicquam ex suo arbitrio
quod inducerent elegerunt, sed acceptam a Christo disciplinam fideliter nationibus assignaverunt."]

[Footnote 185: See Vol. I., p. 224, note 1.]

[Footnote 186: We already find this idea in Tertullian; see de bapt. 15: "Hæretici nullum habent
consortium nostra discipline, quos extraneos utique testatur ipsa ademptio communicationis.
Non debeo in illis cognoscere, quod mihi est præceptum, quia non idem deus est nobis et illis,
nec unus Christus, id est idem, ideoque nec baptismus unus, quia non idem; quem cum rite non
habeant, sine dubio non habent, nec capit numerari, quod non habetur; ita nec possunt accipere
quia non habent." Cyprian passed the same judgment on all schismatics, even on the Novatians,
and like Tertullian maintained the invalidity of heretical baptism. This question agitated
the Church as early as the end of the 2nd century, when Tertullian already wrote against it
in Greek.]

[Footnote 187: As far as possible the Christian virtues of the heretics were described as hypocrisy
and love of ostentation (see e.g., Rhodon in Euseb., H. E. V. 13. 2 and others in the second
century). If this view was untenable, then all morality and heroism among heretics were simply
declared to be of no value. See the anonymous writer in Eusebius, H. E. V. 16. 21, 22; Clem,
Strom. VII. 16. 95; Orig., Comm. ad Rom. I. X., c. 5; Cypr., de unit. 14, 15; cp. 73. 21 etc.]

[Footnote 188: Tertull., de præscr. 3-6.]

[Footnote 189: Irenæus definitely distinguishes between heretics and schismatics (III. 11.
9: IV. 26. 2; 33. 7), but also blames the latter very severely, "qui gloriosum corpus Christi,
quantum in ipsis est, interficiunt, non habentes dei dilectionem suamque utilitatem potius
considerantes quam unitatem ecclesiæ." Note the parallel with Cyprian. Yet he does not class
them with those "qui sunt extra veritatem," i.e., "extra ecclesiam," although he declares the
severest penalties await them. Tertullian was completely preserved by his Montanism from identifying
heretics and schismatics, though in the last years of his life he also appears to have denied
the Christianity of the Catholics (?).]

[Footnote 190: Read, on the one hand, the Antimontanists in Eusebius and the later opponents
of Montanism; and on the other, Tertull., adv. Prax.; Hippol., c. Noët; Novatian, de trinitate.
Even in the case of the Novatians heresies were sought and found (see Dionys. Alex., in Euseb.,
H. E. VII. 8, where we find distortions and wicked misinterpretations of Novatian doctrines,
and many later opponents). Nay, even Cyprian himself did not disdain to join in this proceeding
(see epp. 69. 7: 70. 2). The Montanists at Rome were placed by Hippolylus in the catalogue
of heretics (see the Syntagma and Philosoph.). Origen was uncertain whether to reckon them
among schismatics or heretics (see in Tit. Opp. IV., p. 696).]

[Footnote 191: Cyprian plainly asserts (ep. 3. 3): "hæc sunt initia hæreticorum et ortus adque
conatus schismaticorum, ut præpositum superbo tumore contemnant" (as to the early history of
this conception, which undoubtedly has a basis of truth, see Clem., ep. ad Cor. 1. 44; Ignat.;
Hegesippus in Euseb., H. E. IV. 22. 5; Tertull., adv. Valent. 4; de bapt. 17; Anonymus in Euseb;
H. E. V. 16. 7; Hippolyt. ad. Epiphan. H. 42. 1; Anonymus in Eusebius, H. E. V. 28. 12; according
to Cyprian it is quite the common one); see further ep. 59. 3: "neque enim aliunde hæreses
obortæ sunt aut nata sunt schismata, quam quando sacerdoti dei non obtemperatur;" epp. 66.
5: 69. 1: "item b. apostolus Johannes nec ipse ullam hæresin aut schisma discrevit aut aliquos
speciatim separes posuit"; 52. 1: 73. 2: 74. 11. Schism and heresy are always identical.]

[Footnote 192: Neither Optatus nor Augustine take Cyprian's theory as the starting-point of
their disquisitions, but they adhere in principle to the distinction between heretic and schismatic.
Cyprian was compelled by his special circumstances to identify them, but he united this identification
with the greatest liberality of view as to the conditions of ecclesiastical unity (as regards
individual bishops). Cyprian did not make a single new article an "articulus stantis et cadentis
ecclesiæ." In fact he ultimately declared--and this may have cost him struggle enough--that
even the question of the validity of heretical baptism was not a question of faith.]

CHAPTER III.

CONTINUATION. THE OLD CHRISTIANITY AND THE NEW CHURCH.

1. The legal and political forms by which the Church secured herself against the secular power
and heresy, and still more the lower moral standard exacted from her members in consequence
of the naturalisation of Christianity in the world, called forth a reaction soon after the
middle of the second century. This movement, which first began in Asia Minor and then spread
into other regions of Christendom, aimed at preserving or restoring the old feelings and conditions,
and preventing Christendom from being secularised. This crisis (the so called Montanist struggle)
and the kindred one which succeeded produced the following results: The Church merely regarded
herself all the more strictly as a legal community basing the truth of its title on its historic
and objective foundations, and gave a correspondingly new interpretation to the attribute of
holiness she claimed. She expressly recognised two distinct classes in her midst, a spiritual
and a secular, as well as a double standard of morality. Moreover, she renounced her character
as the communion of those who were sure of salvation, and substituted the claim to be an educational
institution and a necessary condition of redemption. After a keen struggle, in which the New
Testament did excellent service to the bishops, the Church expelled the Cataphrygian fanatics
and the adherents of the new prophecy (between 180 and 220); and in the same way, during the
course of the third century, she caused the secession of all those Christians who made the
truth of the Church depend on a stricter administration of moral discipline. Hence, apart from
the heretic and Montanist sects, there existed in the Empire, after the middle of the second
century, two great but numerically unequal Church confederations, both based on the same rule
of faith and claiming the title "ecclesia catholica," viz., the confederation which Constantine
afterwards chose for his support, and the Novatian Catharist one. In Rome, however, the beginning
of the great disruption goes back to the time of Hippolytus and Calixtus; yet the schism of
Novatian must not be considered as an immediate continuation of that of Hippolytus.

2. The so-called Montanist reaction[193] was itself subjected to a similar change, in accordance
with the advancing ecclesiastical development of Christendom. It was originally the violent
undertaking of a Christian prophet, Montanus, who, supported by prophetesses, felt called upon
to realise the promises held forth in the Fourth Gospel. He explained these by the Apocalypse,
and declared that he himself was the Paraclete whom Christ had promised--that Paraclete in
whom Jesus Christ himself, nay, even God the Father Almighty, comes to his own to guide them
to all truth, to gather those that are dispersed, and to bring them into one flock. His main
effort therefore was to make Christians give up the local and civil relations in which they
lived, to collect them, and create a new undivided Christian commonwealth, which, separated
from the world, should prepare itself for the descent of the Jerusalem from above.[194]

The natural resistance offered to the new prophets with this extravagant message--especially
by the leaders of communities, and the persecutions to which the Church was soon after subjected
under Marcus Aurelius, led to an intensifying of the eschatological expectations that beyond
doubt had been specially keen in Montanist circles from the beginning. For the New Jerusalem
was soon to come down from heaven in visible form, and establish itself in the spot which,
by direction of the Spirit, had been chosen for Christendom in Phrygia.[195] Whatever amount
of peculiarity the movement lost, in so far as the ideal of an assembly of all Christians proved
incapable of being realised or at least only possible within narrow limits, was abundantly
restored in the last decades of the second century by the strength and courage that the news
of its spread in Christendom gave to the earnest minded to unite and offer resistance to the
ever increasing tendency of the Church to assume a secular and political character. Many entire
communities in Phrygia and Asia recognised the divine mission of the prophets. In the Churches
of other provinces religious societies were formed in which the predictions of these prophets
were circulated and viewed as a Gospel, though at the same time they lost their effect by being
so treated. The confessors at Lyons openly expressed their full sympathy with the movement
in Asia. The bishop of Rome was on the verge of acknowledging the Montanists to be in full
communion with the Church. But among themselves there was no longer, as at the beginning, any
question of a new organisation in the strict sense of the word, and of a radical remodelling
of Christian society.[196] Whenever Montanism comes before us in the clear light of history
it rather appears as a religious movement already deadened, though still very powerful. Montanus
and his prophetesses had set no limits to their enthusiasm; nor were there as yet any fixed
barriers in Christendom that could have restrained them.[197] The Spirit, the Son, nay, the
Father himself had appeared in them and spoke through them.[198] Imagination pictured Christ
bodily in female form to the eyes of Prisca.[199] The most extravagant promises were given.[200]
These prophets spoke in a loftier tone than any Apostle ever did, and they were even bold enough
to overturn apostolic regulations.[201] They set up new commandments for the Christian life,
regardless of any tradition,[202] and they inveighed against the main body of Christendom.[203]
They not only proclaimed themselves as prophets, but as the last prophets, as notable prophets
in whom was first fulfilled the promise of the sending of the Paraclete.[204] These Christians
as yet knew nothing of the "absoluteness of a historically complete revelation of Christ as
the fundamental condition of Christian consciousness;" they only felt a Spirit to which they
yielded unconditionally and without reserve. But, after they had quitted the scene, their followers
sought and found a kind of compromise. The Montanist congregations that sought for recognition
in Rome, whose part was taken by the Gallic confessors, and whose principles gained a footing
in North Africa, may have stood in the same relation to the original adherents of the new prophets
and to these prophets themselves, as the Mennonite communities did to the primitive Anabaptists
and their empire in Münster. The "Montanists" outside of Asia Minor acknowledged to the fullest
extent the legal position of the great Church. They declared their adherence to the apostolic
"regula" and the New Testament canon.[205] The organisation of the Churches, and, above all,
the position of the bishops as successors of the Apostles and guardians of doctrine were no
longer disputed. The distinction between them and the main body of Christendom, from which
they were unwilling to secede, was their belief in the new prophecy of Montanus, Prisca, and
Maximilla, which was contained, in its final form, in written records and in this shape may
have produced the same impression as is excited by the fragments of an exploded bomb.[206]

In this new prophecy they recognised a subsequent revelation of God, which for that very reason
assumed the existence of a previous one. This after-revelation professed to decide the practical
questions which, at the end of the second century, were burning topics throughout all Christendom,
and for which no direct divine law could hitherto be adduced, in the form of a strict injunction.
Herein lay the importance of the new prophecy for its adherents in the Empire, and for this
reason they believed in it.[207] The belief in the efficacy of the Paraclete, who, in order
to establish a relatively stricter standard of conduct in Christendom during the latter days,
had, a few decades before, for several years given his revelations in a remote corner of the
Empire, was the dregs of the original enthusiasm, the real aspect of which had been known only
to the fewest. But the diluted form in which this force remained was still a mighty power,
because it was just in the generation between 190 and 220 that the secularising of the Church
had made the greatest strides. Though the followers of the new prophecy merely insisted on
abstinence from second marriage, on stricter regulations with regard to fasts, on a stronger
manifestation of the Christian spirit in daily life, in morals and customs, and finally on
the full resolve not to avoid suffering and martyrdom for Christ's name's sake, but to bear
them willingly and joyfully,[208] yet, under the given circumstances, these requirements, in
spite of the express repudiation of everything "Encratite,"[209] implied a demand that directly
endangered the conquests already made by the Church and impeded the progress of the new propaganda.[210]
The people who put forth these demands, expressly based them on the injunctions of the Paraclete,
and really lived in accordance with them, were not permanently capable of maintaining their
position in the Church. In fact, the endeavour to found these demands on the legislation of
the Paraclete was an undertaking quite as strange, in form and content, as the possible attempt
to represent the wild utterances of determined anarchists as the programme of a constitutional
government. It was of no avail that they appealed to the confirmation of the rule of faith
by the Paraclete; that they demonstrated the harmlessness of the new prophecy, thereby involving
themselves in contradictions;[211] that they showed all honour to the New Testament; and that
they did not insist on the oracles of the Paraclete being inserted in it.[212] As soon as they
proved the earnestness of their temperate but far-reaching demands, a deep gulf that neither
side could ignore opened up between them and their opponents. Though here and there an earnest
effort was made to avoid a schism, yet in a short time this became unavoidable; for variations
in rules of conduct make fellowship impossible. The lax Christians, who, on the strength of
their objective possession, viz., the apostolic doctrine and writings, sought to live comfortably
by conforming to the ways of the world, necessarily sought to rid themselves of inconvenient
societies and inconvenient monitors;[213] and they could only do so by reproaching the latter
with heresy and unchristian assumptions. Moreover, the followers of the new prophets could
not permanently recognise the Churches of the "Psychical,"[214] which rejected the "Spirit"
and extended their toleration so far as to retain even whoremongers and adulterers within their
pale.

In the East, that is, in Asia Minor, the breach between the Montanists and the Church had in
all probability broken out before the question of Church discipline and the right of the bishops
had yet been clearly raised. In Rome and Carthage this question completed the rupture that
had already taken place between the conventicles and the Church (de pudic. 1. 21). Here, by
a peremptory edict, the bishop of Rome claimed the right of forgiving sins as successor of
the Apostles; and declared that he would henceforth exercise this right in favour of repentant
adulterers. Among the Montanists this claim was violently contested both in an abstract sense
and in this application of it. The Spirit the Apostles had received, they said, could not be
transmitted; the Spirit is given to the Church; he works in the prophets, but lastly and in
the highest measure in the new prophets. The latter, however, expressly refused to readmit
gross sinners, though recommending them to the grace of God (see the saying of the Paraclete,
de pud. 21; "potest ecclesia donare delictum, sed non faciam"). Thus agreement was no longer
possible. The bishops were determined to assert the existing claims of the Church, even at
the cost of her Christian character, or to represent the constitution of the Catholic Church
as the guarantee of that character. At the risk of their own claim to be Catholic, the Montanist
sects resisted in order to preserve the minimum legal requirements for a Christian life. Thus
the opposition culminated in an attack on the new powers claimed by the bishops, and in consequence
awakened old memories as to the original state of things, when the clergy had possessed no
importance.[215] But the ultimate motive was the effort to stop the continuous secularising
of the Christian life and to preserve the virginity of the Church as a holy community.[216]
In his latest writings Tertullian vigorously defended a position already lost, and carried
with him to the grave the old strictness of conduct insisted on by the Church.

Had victory remained with the stricter party, which, though not invariably, appealed to the
injunctions of the Paraclete,[217] the Church would have been rent asunder and decimated. The
great opportunist party, however, was in a very difficult position, since their opponents merely
seemed to be acting up to a conception that, in many respects, could not be theoretically disputed.
The problem was how to carry on with caution the work of naturalising Christianity in the world,
and at the same time avoid all appearance of innovation which, as such, was opposed to the
principle of Catholicism. The bishops therefore assailed the form of the new prophecy on the
ground of innovation;[218] they sought to throw suspicion on its content; in some cases even
Chiliasm, as represented by the Montanists, was declared to have a Jewish and fleshly character.[219]
They tried to show that the moral demands of their opponents were extravagant, that they savoured
of the ceremonial law (of the Jews), were opposed to Scripture, and were derived from the worship
of Apis, Isis, and the mother of the Gods.[220] To the claim of furnishing the Church with
authentic oracles of God, set up by their antagonists, the bishops opposed the newly formed
canon; and declared that everything binding on Christians was contained in the utterances of
the Old Testament prophets and the Apostles. Finally, they began to distinguish between the
standard of morality incumbent on the clergy and a different one applying to the laity,[221]
as, for instance, in the question of a single marriage; and they dwelt with increased emphasis
on the glory of the heroic Christians, belonging to the great Church, who had distinguished
themselves by asceticism and joyful submission to martyrdom. By these methods they brought
into disrepute that which had once been dear to the whole Church, but was now of no further
service. In repudiating supposed abuses they more and more weakened the regard felt for the
thing itself, as, for example, in the case of the so-called Chiliasm,[222] congregational prophecy
and the spiritual independence of the laity. But none of these things could be absolutely rejected;
hence, for example, Chiliasm remained virtually unweakened (though subject to limitations[223])
in the West and certain districts of the East; whereas prophecy lost its force so much that
it appeared harmless and therefore died away.[224] However, the most effective means of legitimising
the present state of things in the Church was a circumstance closely connected with the formation
of a canon of early Christian writings, viz., the distinction of an epoch of revelation, along
with a corresponding classical period of Christianity unattainable by later generations. This
period was connected with the present by means of the New Testament and the apostolic office
of the bishops. This later time was to regard the older period as an ideal, but might not dream
of really attaining the same perfection, except at least through the medium of the Holy Scriptures
and the apostolic office, that is, the Church. The place of the holy Christendom that had the
Spirit in its midst was taken by the ecclesiastic institution possessing the "instrument of
divine literature" ("instrumentum divinæ litteraturæ") and the spiritual office. Finally, we
must mention another factor that hastened the various changes; this was the theology of the
Christian philosophers, which attained importance in the Church as soon as she based her claim
on and satisfied her conscience with an objective possession.

3. But there was one rule which specially impeded the naturalisation of the Church in the world
and the transformation of a communion of the saved into an institution for obtaining salvation,
viz., the regulation that excluded gross sinners from Christian membership. Down to the beginning
of the third century, in so far as the backslider did not atone for his guilt[225] by public
confession before the authorities (see Ep. Lugd. in Euseb., H. E. V. 1 ff.), final exclusion
from the Church was still the penalty of relapse into idolatry, adultery, whoredom, and murder;
though at the same time the forgiveness of God in the next world was reserved for the fallen
provided they remained penitent to the end. In theory indeed this rule was not very old. For
the oldest period possessed no theories; and in those days Christians frequently broke through
what might have been counted as one by appealing to the Spirit, who, by special announcements--particularly
by the mouth of martyrs and prophets--commanded or sanctioned the readmission of lapsed members
of the community (see Hermas).[226] Still, the rule corresponded to the ancient notions that
Christendom is a communion of saints, that there is no ceremony invariably capable of replacing
baptism, that is, possessing the same value, and that God alone can forgive sins. The practice
must on the whole have agreed with this rule; but in the course of the latter half of the second
century it became an established custom, in the case of a first relapse, to allow atonement
to be made once for most sins and perhaps indeed for all, on condition of public confession.[227]
For this, appeal was probably made to Hermas, who very likely owed his prestige to the service
he here unwittingly rendered. We say "unwittingly," for he could scarcely have intended such
an application of his precepts, though at bottom it was not directly opposed to his attitude.
In point of fact, however, this practice introduced something closely approximating to a second
baptism. Tertullian indeed (de pænit. 12) speaks unhesitatingly of two planks of salvation.[228]
Moreover, if we consider that in any particular case the decision as to the deadly nature of
the sin in question was frequently attended with great difficulty, and certainly, as a rule,
was not arrived at with rigorous exactness, we cannot fail to see that, in conceding a second
expiation, the Church was beginning to abandon the old idea that Christendom was a community
of saints. Nevertheless the fixed practice of refusing whoremongers, adulterers, murderers,
and idolaters readmission to the Church, in ordinary cases, prevented men from forgetting that
there was a boundary line dividing her from the world.

This state of matters continued till about 220.[229] In reality the rule was first infringed
by the peremptory edict of bishop Calixtus, who, in order to avoid breaking up his community,
granted readmission to those who had fallen into sins of the flesh. Moreover, he claimed this
power of readmission as a right appertaining to the bishops as successors of the Apostles,
that is, as possessors of the Spirit and the power of the keys.[230] At Rome this rescript
led to the secession headed by Hippolytus. But, between 220 and 250, the milder practice with
regard to the sins of the flesh became prevalent, though it was not yet universally accepted.
This, however, resulted in no further schism (Cyp., ep. 55. 21). But up to the year 250 no
concessions were allowed in the case of relapse into idolatry.[231] These were first occasioned
by the Decian persecution, since in many towns those who had abjured Christianity were more
numerous than those who adhered to it.[232] The majority of the bishops, part of them with
hesitation, agreed on new principles.[233] To begin with, permission was given to absolve repentant
apostates on their deathbed. Next, a distinction was made between sacrificati and libellatici,
the latter being more mildly treated. Finally, the possibility of readmission was conceded
under certain severe conditions to all the lapsed, a casuistic proceeding was adopted in regard
to the laity, and strict measures--though this was not the universal rule--were only adopted
towards the clergy. In consequence of this innovation, which logically resulted in the gradual
cessation of the belief that there can be only one repentance after baptism--an assumption
that was untenable in principle--Novatian's schism took place and speedily rent the Church
in twain. But, even in cases where unity was maintained, many communities observed the stricter
practice down to the fifth century.[234] What made it difficult to introduce this change by
regular legislation was the authority to forgive sins in God's stead, ascribed in primitive
times to the inspired, and at a later period to the confessors in virtue of their special relation
to Christ or the Spirit (see Ep. Lugd. in Euseb., H. E. V. 1 ff.; Cypr. epp.; Tertull. de pudic.
22). The confusion occasioned by the confessors after the Decian persecution led to the non-recognition
of any rights of "spiritual" persons other than the bishops. These confessors had frequently
abetted laxity of conduct, whereas, if we consider the measure of secularisation found among
the great mass of Christians, the penitential discipline insisted on by the bishops is remarkable
for its comparative severity. The complete adoption of the episcopal constitution coincided
with the introduction of the unlimited right to forgive sins.[235]

4. The original conception of the relation of the Church to salvation or eternal bliss was
altered by this development. According to the older notion the Church was the sure communion
of salvation and of saints, which rested on the forgiveness of sins mediated by baptism, and
excluded everything unholy. It is not the Church, but God alone, that forgives sins, and, as
a rule, indeed, this is only done through baptism, though, in virtue of his unfathomable grace,
also now and then by special proclamations, the pardon coming into effect for repentant sinners,
after death, in heaven. If Christendom readmitted gross sinners, it would anticipate the judgment
of God, as it would thereby assure them of salvation. Hence it can only take back those who
have been excluded in cases where their offences have not been committed against God himself,
but have consisted in transgressing the commandments of the Church, that is, in venial sins.[236]
But in course of time it was just in lay circles that faith in God's grace became weaker and
trust in the Church stronger. He whom the Church abandoned was lost to the world; therefore
she must not abandon him. This state of things was expressed in the new interpretation of the
proposition, "no salvation outside the Church" ("extra ecclesiam nulla salus"), viz., the Church
alone saves from damnation which is otherwise certain. In this conception the nature of the
Church is depotentiated, but her powers are extended. If she is the institution which, according
to Cyprian, is the indispensable preliminary condition of salvation, she can no longer be a
sure communion of the saved; in other words, she becomes an institution from which proceeds
the communion of saints; she includes both saved and unsaved. Thus her religious character
consists in her being the indispensable medium, in so far as she alone guarantees to the individual
the possibility of redemption. From this, however, it immediately follows that the Church would
anticipate the judgment of God if she finally excluded anyone from her membership who did not
give her up of his own accord; whereas she could never prejudge the ultimate destiny of a man
by readmission.[237] But it also follows that the Church must possess a means of repairing
any injury upon earth, a means of equal value with baptism, namely, a sacrament of the forgiveness
of sins. With this she acts in God's name and stead, but--and herein lies the inconsistency--she
cannot by this means establish any final condition of salvation. In bestowing forgiveness on
the sinner she in reality only reconciles him with herself, and thereby, in fact, merely removes
the certainty of damnation. In accordance with this theory the holiness of the Church can merely
consist in her possession of the means of salvation: the Church is a holy institution in virtue
of the gifts with which she is endowed. She is the moral seminary that trains for salvation
and the institution that exercises divine powers in Christ's room. Both of these conceptions
presuppose political forms; both necessarily require priests and more especially an episcopate.
(In de pudic. 21 Tertullian already defines the position of his adversary by the saying, "ecclesia
est numerus episcoporum.") This episcopate by its unity guarantees the unity of the Church
and has received the power to forgive sins (Cyp., ep. 69. 11).

The new conception of the Church, which was a necessary outcome of existing circumstances and
which, we may remark, was not formulated in contradictory terms by Cyprian, but by Roman bishops,[238]
was the first thing that gave a fundamental religious significance to the separation of clergy
and laity. The powers exercised by bishops and priests were thereby fixed and hallowed. No
doubt the old order of things, which gave laymen a share in the administration of moral discipline,
still continued in the third century, but it became more and more a mere form. The bishop became
the practical vicegerent of Christ; he disposed of the power to bind and to loose. But the
recollection of the older form of Christianity continued to exert an influence on the Catholic
Church of the third century. It is true that, if we can trust Hippolytus' account, Calixtus
had by this time firmly set his face against the older idea, inasmuch as he not only defined
the Church as essentially a mixed body (corpus permixtum), but also asserted the unlawfulness
of deposing the bishop even in case of mortal sin.[239] But we do not find that definition
in Cyprian, and, what is of more importance, he still required a definite degree of active
Christianity as a sine quâ non in the case of bishops; and assumed it as a self-evident necessity.
He who does not give evidence of this forfeits his episcopal office ipso facto.[240] Now if
we consider that Cyprian makes the Church, as the body of believers (plebs credentium), so
dependent on the bishops, that the latter are the only Christians not under tutelage, the demand
in question denotes a great deal. It carries out the old idea of the Church in a certain fashion,
as far as the bishops are concerned. But for this very reason it endangers the new conception
in a point of capital importance; for the spiritual acts of a sinful bishop are invalid;[241]
and if the latter, as a notorious sinner, is no longer bishop, the whole certainty of the ecclesiastical
system ceases. Moreover, an appeal to the certainty of God's installing the bishops and always
appointing the right ones[242] is of no avail, if false ones manifestly find their way in.
Hence Cyprian's idea of the Church--and this is no dishonour to him--still involved an inconsistency
which, in the fourth century, was destined to produce a very serious crisis in the Donatist
struggle.[243] The view, however--which Cyprian never openly expressed, and which was merely
the natural inference from his theory--that the Catholic Church, though the "one dove" ("una
columba"), is in truth not coincident with the number of the elect, was clearly recognised
and frankly expressed by Origen before him. Origen plainly distinguished between spiritual
and fleshly members of the Church; and spoke of such as only belong to her outwardly, but are
not Christians. As these are finally overpowered by the gates of hell, Origen does not hesitate
to class them as merely seeming members of the Church. Conversely, he contemplates the possibility
of a person being expelled from her fellowship and yet remaining a member in the eyes of God.[244]
Nevertheless he by no means attained to clearness on the point, in which case, moreover, he
would have been the first to do so; nor did he give an impulse to further reflection on the
problem. Besides, speculations were of no use here. The Church with her priests, her holy books,
and gifts of grace, that is, the moderate secularisation of Christendom corrected by the means
of grace, was absolutely needed in order to prevent a complete lapse into immorality.[245]

But a minority struggled against this Church, not with speculations, but by demanding adherence
to the old practice with regard to lapsed members. Under the leadership of the Roman presbyter,
Novatian, this section formed a coalition in the Empire that opposed the Catholic confederation.[246]
Their adherence to the old system of Church discipline involved a reaction against the secularising
process, which did not seem to be tempered by the spiritual powers of the bishops. Novatian's
conception of the Church, of ecclesiastical absolution and the rights of the priests, and in
short, his notion of the power of the keys is different from that of his opponents. This is
clear from a variety of considerations. For he (with his followers) assigned to the Church
the right and duty of expelling gross sinners once for all;[247] he denied her the authority
to absolve idolaters, but left these to the forgiveness of God who alone has the power of pardoning
sins committed against himself; and he asserted: "non est pax illi ab episcopo necessaria habituro
gloriæ suæ (scil. martyrii) pacem et accepturo maiorem de domini dignatione mercedem,"--"the
absolution of the bishop is not needed by him who will receive the peace of his glory (i.e.,
martyrdom) and will obtain a greater reward from the approbation of the Lord" (Cypr. ep. 57.
4), and on the other hand taught: "peccato alterius inquinari alterum et idololatriam delinquentis
ad non delinquentem transire,"--"the one is defiled by the sin of the other and the idolatry
of the transgressor passes over to him who does not transgress." His proposition that none
but God can forgive sins does not depotentiate the idea of the Church; but secures both her
proper religious significance and the full sense of her dispensations of grace: it limits her
powers and extent in favour of her content. Refusal of her forgiveness under certain circumstances--though
this does not exclude the confident hope of God's mercy--can only mean that in Novatian's view
this forgiveness is the foundation of salvation and does not merely avert the certainty of
perdition. To the Novatians, then, membership of the Church is not the sine quâ non of salvation,
but it really secures it in some measure. In certain cases nevertheless the Church may not
anticipate the judgment of God. Now it is never by exclusion, but by readmission, that she
does so. As the assembly of the baptised, who have received God's forgiveness, the Church must
be a real communion of salvation and of saints; hence she cannot endure unholy persons in her
midst without losing her essence. Each gross sinner that is tolerated within her calls her
legitimacy in question. But, from this point of view, the constitution of the Church, i.e.,
the distinction of lay and spiritual and the authority of the bishops, likewise retained nothing
but the secondary importance it had in earlier times. For, according to those principles, the
primary question as regards Church membership is not connection with the clergy (the bishop).
It is rather connection with the community, fellowship with which secures the salvation that
may indeed be found outside its pale, but not with certainty. But other causes contributed
to lessen the importance of the bishops: the art of casuistry, so far-reaching in its results,
was unable to find a fruitful soil here, and the laity were treated in exactly the same way
as the clergy. The ultimate difference between Novatian and Cyprian as to the idea of the Church
and the power to bind and loose did not become clear to the latter himself. This was because,
in regard to the idea of the Church, he partly overlooked the inferences from his own view
and to some extent even directly repudiated them. An attempt to lay down a principle for judging
the case is found in ep. 69. 7: "We and the schismatics have neither the same law of the creed
nor the same interrogation, for when they say: 'you believe in the remission of sins and eternal
life through the holy Church,' they speak falsely" ("non est una nobis et schismaticis symboli
lex neque eadem interrogatio; nam cum dicunt, credis in remissionem peccatorum et vitam æternam
per sanctam ecclesiam, mentiuntur"). Nor did Dionysius of Alexandria, who endeavoured to accumulate
reproaches against Novatian, succeed in forming any effective accusation (Euseb., H. E. VII.
8). Pseudo-Cyprian had just as little success (ad Novatianum).

It was not till the subsequent period, when the Catholic Church had resolutely pursued the
path she had entered, that the difference in principle manifested itself with unmistakable
plainness. The historical estimate of the contrast must vary in proportion as one contemplates
the demands of primitive Christianity or the requirements of the time. The Novatian confederation
undoubtedly preserved a valuable remnant of the old tradition. The idea that the Church, as
a fellowship of salvation, must also be the fellowship of saints ([Greek: Katharoi]) corresponds
to the ideas of the earliest period. The followers of Novatian did not entirely identify the
political and religious attributes of the Church; they neither transformed the gifts of salvation
into means of education, nor confused the reality with the possibility of redemption; and they
did not completely lower the requirements for a holy life. But on the other hand, in view of
the minimum insisted upon, the claim that they were the really evangelical party and that they
fulfilled the law of Christ[248] was a presumption. The one step taken to avert the secularising
of the Church, exclusion of the lapsed, was certainly, considering the actual circumstances
immediately following a great apostasy, a measure of radical importance; but, estimated by
the Gospel and in fact simply by the demands of the Montanists fifty years before, it was remarkably
insignificant. These Catharists did indeed go the length of expelling all so-called mortal
sinners, because it was too crying an injustice to treat libellatici more severely than unabashed
transgressors;[249] but, even then, it was still a gross self-deception to style themselves
the "pure ones," since the Novatian Churches speedily ceased to be any stricter than the Catholic
in their renunciation of the world. At least we do not hear that asceticism and devotion to
religious faith were very much more prominent in the Catharist Church than in the Catholic.
On the contrary, judging from the sources that have come down to us, we may confidently say
that the picture presented by the two Churches in the subsequent period was practically identical.[250]
As Novatian's adherents did not differ from the opposite party in doctrine and constitution,
their discipline of penance appears an archaic fragment which it was a doubtful advantage to
preserve; and their rejection of the Catholic dispensations of grace (practice of rebaptism)
a revolutionary measure, because it had insufficient justification. But the distinction between
venial and mortal sins, a theory they held in common with the Catholic Church, could not but
prove especially fatal to them; whereas their opponents, through their new regulations as to
penance, softened this distinction, and that not to the detriment of morality. For an entirely
different treatment of so-called gross and venial transgressions must in every case deaden
the conscience towards the latter.

5. If we glance at the Catholic Church and leave the melancholy recriminations out of account,
we cannot fail to see the wisdom, foresight, and comparative strictness[251] with which the
bishops carried out the great revolution that so depotentiated the Church as to make her capable
of becoming a prop of civic society and of the state, without forcing any great changes upon
them.[252] In learning to look upon the Church as a training school for salvation, provided
with penalties and gifts of grace, and in giving up its religious independence in deference
to her authority, Christendom as it existed in the latter half of the third century,[253] submitted
to an arrangement that was really best adapted to its own interests. In the great Church every
distinction between her political and religious conditions necessarily led to fatal disintegrations,
to laxities, such as arose in Carthage owing to the enthusiastic behaviour of the confessors;
or to the breaking up of communities. The last was a danger incurred in all cases where the
attempt was made to exercise unsparing severity. A casuistic proceeding was necessary as well
as a firm union of the bishops as pillars of the Church. Not the least important result of
the crises produced by the great persecutions was the fact that the bishops in West and East
were thereby forced into closer connection and at the same time acquired full jurisdiction
("per episcopos solos peccata posse dimitti"). If we consider that the archiepiscopal constitution
had not only been simultaneously adopted, but had also attained the chief significance in the
ecclesiastical organisation,[254] we may say that the Empire Church was completed the moment
that Diocletian undertook the great reorganisation of his dominions.[255] No doubt the old
Christianity had found its place in the new Church, but it was covered over and concealed.
In spite of all that, little alteration had been made in the expression of faith, in religious
language; people spoke of the universal holy Church, just as they did a hundred years before.
Here the development in the history of dogma was in a very special sense a development in the
history of the Church. Catholicism was now complete; the Church had suppressed all utterances
of individual piety, in the sense of their being binding on Christians, and freed herself from
every feature of exclusiveness. In order to be a Christian a man no longer required in any
sense to be a saint. "What made the Christian a Christian was no longer the possession of charisms,
but obedience to ecclesiastical authority," share in the gifts of the Church, and the performance
of penance and good works. The Church by her edicts legitimised average morality, after average
morality had created the authority of the Church. ("La médiocrité fonda l'autorité".) The dispensations
of grace, that is, absolution and the Lord's Supper, abolished the charismatic gifts. The Holy
Scriptures, the apostolic episcopate, the priests, the sacraments, average morality in accordance
with which the whole world could live, were mutually conditioned. The consoling words: "Jesus
receives sinners," were subjected to an interpretation that threatened to make them detrimental
to morality.[256] And with all that the self-righteousness of proud ascetics was not excluded--quite
the contrary. Alongside of a code of morals, to which any one in case of need could adapt himself,
the Church began to legitimise a morality of self-chosen, refined sanctity, which really required
no Redeemer. It was as in possession of this constitution that the great statesman found and
admired her, and recognised in her the strongest support of the Empire.[257]

A comparison of the aims of primitive Christendom with those of ecclesiastical society at the
end of the third century--a comparison of the actual state of things at the different periods
is hardly possible--will always lead to a disheartening result; but the parallel is in itself
unjust. The truth rather is that the correct standpoint from which to judge the matter was
already indicated by Origen in the comparison he drew (c. Cels. III. 29. 30) between the Christian
society of the third century and the non-Christian, between the Church and the Empire, the
clergy and the magistrates.[258] Amidst the general disorganisation of all relationships, and
from amongst the ruins of a shattered fabric, a new structure, founded on the belief in one
God, in a sure revelation, and in eternal life, was being laboriously raised. It gathered within
it more and more all the elements still capable of continued existence; it readmitted the old
world, cleansed of its grossest impurities, and raised holy barriers to secure its conquests
against all attacks. Within this edifice justice and civic virtue shone with no greater brightness
than they did upon the earth generally, but within it burned two mighty flames--the assurance
of eternal life, guaranteed by Christ, and the practice of mercy. He who knows history is aware
that the influence of epoch-making personages is not to be sought in its direct consequences
alone, as these speedily disappear: that structure which prolonged the life of a dying world,
and brought strength from the Holy One to another struggling into existence, was also partly
founded on the Gospel, and but for this would neither have arisen nor attained solidity. Moreover,
a Church had been created within which the pious layman could find a holy place of peace and
edification. With priestly strife he had nothing to do, nor had he any concern in the profound
and subtle dogmatic system whose foundation was now being laid. We may say that the religion
of the laity attained freedom in proportion as it became impossible for them to take part in
the establishment and guardianship of the official Church system. It is the professional guardians
of this ecclesiastical edifice who are the real martyrs of religion, and it is they who have
to bear the consequences of the worldliness and lack of genuineness pertaining to the system.
But to the layman who seeks from the Church nothing more than aid in raising himself to God,
this worldliness and unveracity do not exist. During the Greek period, however, laymen were
only able to recognise this advantage to a limited extent. The Church dogmatic and the ecclesiastical
system were still too closely connected with their own interests. It was in the Middle Ages,
that the Church first became a Holy Mother and her house a house of prayer--for the Germanic
peoples; for these races were really the children of the Church, and they themselves had not
helped to rear the house in which they worshipped.

ADDENDA.

I. THE PRIESTHOOD. The completion of the old Catholic conception of the Church, as this idea
was developed in the latter half of the third century, is perhaps most clearly shown in the
attribute of priesthood, with which the clergy were invested and which conferred on them the
greatest importance.[259] The development of this conception, whose adoption is a proof that
the Church had assumed a heathen complexion, cannot be more particularly treated of here.[260]
What meaning it has is shown by its application in Cyprian and the original of the first six
books of the Apostolic Constitutions (see Book II.). The bishops (and also the presbyters)
are priests, in so far as they alone are empowered to present the sacrifice as representatives
of the congregation before God[261] and in so far as they dispense or refuse the divine grace
as representatives of God in relation to the congregation. In this sense they are also judges
in God's stead.[262] The position here conceded to the higher clergy corresponds to that of
the mystagogue in heathen religions, and is acknowledged to be borrowed from the latter.[263]
Divine grace already appears as a sacramental consecration of an objective nature, the bestowal
of which is confined to spiritual personages chosen by God. This fact is no way affected by
the perception that an ever increasing reference is made to the Old Testament priests as well
as to the whole Jewish ceremonial and ecclesiastical regulations.[264] It is true that there
is no other respect in which Old Testament commandments were incorporated with Christianity
to such an extent as they were in this.[265] But it can be proved that this formal adoption
everywhere took place at a subsequent date, that is, it had practically no influence on the
development itself, which was not legitimised by the commandments till a later period, and
that often in a somewhat lame fashion. We may perhaps say that the development which made the
bishops and elders priests altered the inward form of the Church in a more radical fashion
than any other. "Gnosticism," which the Church had repudiated in the second century, became
part of her own system in the third. As her integrity had been made dependent on inalienable
objective standards, the adoption even of this greatest innovation, which indeed was in complete
harmony with the secular element within her, was an elementary necessity. In regard to every
sphere of Church life, and hence also in respect to the development of dogma[266] and the interpretation
of the Holy Scriptures, the priesthood proved of the highest significance. The clerical exposition
of the sacred books, with its frightful ideas, found its earliest advocate in Cyprian and had
thus a most skilful champion at the very first.[267]

II. SACRIFICE. In Book I., chap. III., § 7, we have already shown what a wide field the idea
of sacrifice occupied in primitive Christendom, and how it was specially connected with the
celebration of the Lord's Supper. The latter was regarded as the pure (i.e., to be presented
with a pure heart), bloodless thank offering of which Malachi had prophesied in I. 11. Priesthood
and sacrifice, however, are mutually conditioned. The alteration of the concept "priest" necessarily
led to a simultaneous and corresponding change in the idea of sacrifice, just as, conversely,
the latter reacted on the former.[268] In Irenæus and Tertullian the old conception of sacrifice,
viz., that prayers are the Christian sacrifice and that the disposition of the believer hallows
his whole life even as it does his offering, and forms a well-pleasing sacrifice to God, remains
essentially unchanged. In particular, there is no evidence of any alteration in the notion
of sacrifice connected with the Lord's Supper.[269] But nevertheless we can already trace a
certain degree of modification in Tertullian. Not only does he give fasting, voluntary celibacy,
martyrdom, etc., special prominence among the sacrificial acts of a Christian life, and extol
their religious value--as had already been done before; but he also attributes a God-propitiating
significance to these performances, and plainly designates them as "merita" ("promereri deum").
To the best of my belief Tertullian was the first who definitely regarded ascetic performances
as propitiatory offerings and ascribed to them the "potestas reconciliandi iratum deum."[270]
But he himself was far from using this fatal theory, so often found in his works, to support
a lax Church practice that made Christianity consist in outward forms. This result did not
come about till the eventful decades, prolific in new developments, that elapsed between the
persecutions of Septimius and Decius; and in the West it is again Cyprian who is our earliest
witness as to the new view and practice.[271] In the first place, Cyprian was quite familiar
with the idea of ascetic propitiations and utilised it in the interest of the Catholicity of
the Church; secondly, he propounded a new theory of the offering in the cultus. As far as the
first point is concerned, Cyprian's injunctions with regard to it are everywhere based on the
understanding that even after baptism no one can be without sin (de op. et cleemos. 3); and
also on the firm conviction that this sacrament can only have a retrospective virtue. Hence
he concludes that we must appease God, whose wrath has been aroused by sin, through performances
of our own, that is, through offerings that bear the character of "satisfactions." In other
words we must blot out transgressions by specially meritorious deeds in order thus to escape
eternal punishment. These deeds Cyprian terms "merita," which either possess the character
of atonements, or, in case there are no sins to be expiated, entitle the Christian to a special
reward (merces).[272] But, along with lamentationes and acts of penance, it is principally
alms-giving that forms such means of atonement (see de lapsis, 35, 36). In Cyprian's eyes this
is already the proper satisfaction; mere prayer, that is, devotional exercises unaccompanied
by fasting and alms, being regarded as "bare and unfruitful." In the work "de opere et eleemosynis"
which, after a fashion highly characteristic of Cyprian, is made dependent on Sirach and Tobias,
he has set forth a detailed theory of what we may call alms-giving as a means of grace in its
relation to baptism and salvation.[273] However, this practice can only be viewed as a means
of grace in Cyprian's sense in so far as God has accepted it, that is, pointed it out. In itself
it is a free human act. After the Decian persecution and the rearrangement of ecclesiastical
affairs necessitated by it, works and alms (opera et eleemosynæ) made their way into the absolution
system of the Church, and were assigned a permanent place in it. Even the Christian who has
forfeited his Church membership by abjuration may ultimately recover it by deeds of sacrifice,
of course under the guidance and intercessory coöperation of the Church. The dogmatic dilemma
we find here cannot be more clearly characterised than by simply placing the two doctrines
professed by Cyprian side by side. These are:--(1) that the sinfulness common to each individual
can only be once extirpated by the power of baptism derived from the work of Christ, and (2)
that transgressions committed after baptism, inclusive of mortal sins, can and must be expiated
solely by spontaneous acts of sacrifice under the guidance of kind mother Church.[274] A Church
capable of being permanently satisfied with such doctrines would very soon have lost the last
remains of her Christian character. What was wanted was a means of grace, similar to baptism
and granted by God through Christ, to which the opera et eleemosynæ are merely to bear the
relation of accompanying acts. But Cyprian was no dogmatist and was not able to form a doctrine
of the means of grace. He never got beyond his "propitiate God the judge by sacrifices after
baptism" ("promereri deum judicem post baptismum sacrificiis"), and merely hinted, in an obscure
way, that the absolution of him who has committed a deadly sin after baptism emanates from
the same readiness of God to forgive as is expressed in that rite, and that membership in the
Church is a condition of absolution. His whole theory as to the legal nature of man's (the
Christian's) relationship to God, and the practice, inaugurated by Tertullian, of designating
this connection by terms derived from Roman law continued to prevail in the West down to Augustine's
time.[275] But, during this whole interval, no book was written by a Western Churchman which
made the salvation of the sinful Christian dependent on ascetic offerings of atonement, with
so little regard to Christ's grace and the divine factor in the case, as Cyprian's work de
opere et eleemosynis.

No less significant is Cyprian's advance as regards the idea of the sacrifice in public worship,
and that in three respects. To begin with, Cyprian was the first to associate the specific
offering, i.e., the Lord's Supper[276] with the specific priesthood. Secondly, he was the first
to designate the passio dominis, nay, the sanguis Christi and the dominica hostia as the object
of the eucharistic offering.[277] Thirdly, he expressly represented the celebration of the
Lord's Supper as an incorporation of the congregation and its individual members with Christ,
and was the first to bear clear testimony as to the special importance attributed to commemoration
of the celebrators ("vivi et defuncti"), though no other can be ascertained than a specially
strong intercession.[278] But this is really the essential effect of the sacrifice of the supper
as regards the celebrators; for however much the conceptions about this ceremony might be heightened,
and whatever additions might be made to its ritual, forgiveness of sins in the strict sense
could not be associated with it. Cyprian's statement that every celebration of the Lord's Supper
is a repetition or imitation of Christ's sacrifice of himself, and that the ceremony has therefore
an expiatory value remains a mere assertion, though the Romish Church still continues to repeat
this doctrine to the present day. For the idea that partaking of the Lord's Supper cleansed
from sin like the mysteries of the Great Mother (magna mater) and Mithras, though naturally
suggested by the ceremonial practice, was counteracted by the Church principles of penance
and by the doctrine of baptism. As a sacrificial rite the Supper never became a ceremony equivalent
in effect to baptism. But no doubt, as far as the popular conception was concerned, the solemn
ritual copied from the ancient mysteries could not but attain an indescribably important significance.
It is not possible, within the framework of the history of dogma, to describe the development
of religious ceremonial in the third century, and to show what a radical alteration took place
in men's conceptions with regard to it (cf. for example, Justin with Cyprian). But, in dealing
with the history of dogma within this period, we must clearly keep in view the development
of the cultus, the new conceptions of the value of ritual, and the reference of ceremonial
usages to apostolic tradition; for there was plainly a remodelling of the ritual in imitation
of the ancient mysteries and of the heathen sacrificial system, and this fact is admitted by
Protestant scholars of all parties. Ceremonial and doctrine may indeed be at variance, for
the latter may lag behind the former and vice versa, but they are never subject to entirely
different conditions.

III. MEANS OF GRACE, BAPTISM, and EUCHARIST. That which the Western Church of post-Augustinian
times calls sacrament in the specific sense of the word (means of grace) was only possessed
by the Church of the third century in the form of baptism.[279] In strict theory she still
held that the grace once bestowed in this rite could be conferred by no holy ceremony of equal
virtue, that is, by no fresh sacrament. The baptised Christian has no means of grace, conferred
by Christ, at his disposal, but has his law to fulfil (see, e.g., Iren. IV. 27. 2). But, as
soon as the Church began to absolve mortal sinners, she practically possessed in absolution
a real means of grace that was equally effective with baptism from the moment that this remission
became unlimited in its application.[280] The notions as to this means of grace, however, continued
quite uncertain in so far as the thought of God's absolving the sinner through the priest was
qualified by the other theory (see above) which asserted that forgiveness was obtained through
the penitential acts of transgressors (especially baptism with blood, and next in importance
lamentationes, ieiunia, eleemosynæ). In the third century there were manifold holy dispensations
of grace by the hands of priests; but there was still no theory which traced the means of grace
to the historical work of Christ in the same way that the grace bestowed in baptism was derived
from it. From Cyprian's epistles and the anti-Novatian sections in the first six books of the
Apostolic Constitutions we indeed see that appeal was not unfrequently made to the power of
forgiving sins bestowed on the Apostles and to Christ's declaration that he received sinners;
but, as the Church had not made up her mind to repeat baptism, so also she had yet no theory
that expressly and clearly supplemented this rite by a sacramentum absolutionis. In this respect,
as well as in regard to the sacramentum ordinis, first instituted by Augustine, theory remained
far behind practice. This was by no means an advantage, for, as a matter of fact, the whole
religious ceremonial was already regarded as a system of means of grace. The consciousness
of a personal, living connection of the individual with God through Christ had already disappeared,
and the hesitation in setting up new means of grace had only the doubtful result of increasing
the significance of human acts, such as offerings and satisfactions, to a dangerous extent.

Since the middle of the second century the notions of baptism[281] in the Church have not essentially
altered (see Vol. I. p. 206 ff.). The result of baptism was universally considered to be forgiveness
of sins, and this pardon was supposed to effect an actual sinlessness which now required to
be maintained.[282] We frequently find "deliverance from death," "regeneration of man," "restoration
to the image of God," and "obtaining of the Holy Spirit." ("Absolutio mortes," "regeneratio
hominis," "restitutio ad similitudinem dei" and "consecutio spiritus sancti") named along with
the "remission of sins" and "obtaining of eternal life" ("remissio delictorum" and "consecutio
æternitatis"). Examples are to be found in Tertullian[283] adv. Marc. I. 28 and elsewhere;
and Cyprian speaks of the "bath of regeneration and sanctification" ("lavacrum regenerationis
et sanctificationis"). Moreover, we pretty frequently find rhetorical passages where, on the
strength of New Testament texts, all possible blessings are associated with baptism.[284] The
constant additions to the baptismal ritual, a process which had begun at a very early period,
are partly due to the intention of symbolising these supposedly manifold virtues of baptism,[285]
and partly owe their origin to the endeavour to provide the great mystery with fit accompaniments.[286]
As yet the separate acts can hardly be proved to have an independent signification.[287] The
water was regarded both as the symbol of the purification of the soul and as an efficacious,
holy medium of the Spirit (in accordance with Gen. I. 2; water and Spirit are associated with
each other, especially in Cyprian's epistles on baptism). He who asserted the latter did not
thereby repudiate the former (see Orig. in Joann. Tom. VI. 17, Opp. IV. p. 133).[288] Complete
obscurity prevails as to the Church's adoption of the practice of child baptism, which, though
it owes its origin to the idea of this ceremony being indispensable to salvation, is nevertheless
a proof that the superstitious view of baptism had increased.[289] In the time of Irenæus (II.
22. 4) and Tertullian (de bapt. 18) child baptism had already become very general and was founded
on Matt. XIX. 14. We have no testimony regarding it from earlier times; Clement of Alexandria
does not yet assume it. Tertullian argued against it not only because he regarded conscious
faith as a needful preliminary condition, but also because he thought it advisable to delay
baptism (cunctatio baptismi) on account of the responsibility involved in it (pondus baptismi).
He says: "It is more advantageous to delay baptism, especially in the case of little children.
For why is it necessary for the sponsors" (this is the first mention of "godparents") "also
to be thrust into danger?... let the little ones therefore come when they are growing up; let
them come when they are learning, when they are taught where they are coming to; let them become
Christians when they are able to know Christ. Why does an age of innocence hasten to the remission
of sins? People will act more cautiously in worldly affairs, so that one who is not trusted
with earthly things is trusted with divine. Whoever understands the responsibility of baptism
will fear its attainment more than its delay."[290] To all appearance the practice of immediately
baptising the children of Christian families was universally adopted in the Church in the course
of the third century. (Origen, Comment, in ep. ad Rom. V. 9, Opp. IV. p. 565, declared child
baptism to be a custom handed down by the Apostles.) Grown up people, on the other hand, frequently
postponed baptism, but this habit was disapproved.[291]

The Lord's Supper was not only regarded as a sacrifice, but also as a divine gift.[292] The
effects of this gift were not theoretically fixed, because these were excluded by the strict
scheme[293] of baptismal grace and baptismal obligation. But in practice Christians more and
more assumed a real bestowal of heavenly gifts in the holy food, and gave themselves over to
superstitious theories. This bestowal was sometimes regarded as a spiritual and sometimes as
a bodily self-communication of Christ, that is, as a miraculous implanting of divine life.
Here ethical and physical, and again ethical and theoretical features were intermixed with
each other. The utterances of the Fathers to which we have access do not allow us to classify
these elements here; for to all appearance not a single one clearly distinguished between spiritual
and bodily, or ethical and intellectual effects unless he was in principle a spiritualist.
But even a writer of this kind had quite as superstitious an idea of the holy elements as the
rest. Thus the holy meal was extolled as the communication of incorruption, as a pledge of
resurrection, as a medium of the union of the flesh with the Holy Spirit; and again as food
of the soul, as the bearer of the Spirit of Christ (the Logos), as the means of strengthening
faith and knowledge, as a sanctifying of the whole personality. The thought of the forgiveness
of sins fell quite into the background. This ever changing conception, as it seems to us, of
the effects of partaking of the Lord's Supper had also a parallel in the notions as to the
relation between the visible elements and the body of Christ. So far as we are able to judge
no one felt that there was a problem here, no one enquired whether this relation was realistic
or symbolical. The symbol is the mystery and the mystery was not conceivable without a symbol.
In the popular idea the consecrated elements were heavenly fragments of magical virtue (see
Cypr., de laps. 25; Euseb., H. E. VI. 44). With these the rank and file of third-century Christians
already connected many superstitious notions which the priests tolerated or shared.[294] The
antignostic Fathers acknowledged that the consecrated food consisted of two things, an earthly
(the elements) and a heavenly (the real body of Christ). They thus saw in the sacrament a guarantee
of the union between spirit and flesh, which the Gnostics denied; and a pledge of the resurrection
of the flesh nourished by the blood of the Lord (Justin; Iren. IV. 18. 4, 5; V. 2. 2, 3; likewise
Tertullian who is erroneously credited with a "symbolical" doctrine[295]). Clement and Origen
"spiritualise," because, like Ignatius, they assign a spiritual significance to the flesh and
blood of Christ himself (summary of wisdom). To judge from the exceedingly confused passage
in Pæd. II. 2, Clement distinguishes a spiritual and a material blood of Christ. Finally, however,
he sees in the Eucharist the union of the divine Logos with the human spirit, recognises, like
Cyprian at a later period, that the mixture of wine with water in the symbol represents the
spiritual process, and lastly does not fail to attribute to the holy food a relationship to
the body.[296] It is true that Origen, the great mysteriosophist and theologian of sacrifice,
expressed himself in plainly "spiritualistic" fashion; but in his eyes religious mysteries
and the whole person of Christ lay in the province of the spirit, and therefore his theory
of the Supper is not "symbolical," but conformable to his doctrine of Christ. Besides, Origen
was only able to recognise spiritual aids in the sphere of the intellect and the disposition,
and in the assistance given to these by man's own free and spontaneous efforts. Eating and
drinking and, in general, participation in a ceremonial are from Origen's standpoint completely
indifferent matters. The intelligent Christian feeds at all times on the body of Christ, that
is, on the Word of God, and thus celebrates a never ending Supper (c. Cels. VIII. 22). Origen,
however, was not blind to the fact that his doctrine of the Lord's Supper was just as far removed
from the faith of the simple Christian as his doctrinal system generally. Here also, therefore,
he accommodated himself to that faith in points where it seemed necessary. This, however, he
did not find difficult; for, though with him everything is at bottom "spiritual," he was unwilling
to dispense with symbols and mysteries, because he knew that one must be initiated into the
spiritual, since one cannot learn it as one learns the lower sciences.[297] But, whether we
consider simple believers, the antignostic Fathers or Origen, and, moreover, whether we view
the Supper as offering or sacrament, we everywhere observe that the holy ordinance had been
entirely diverted from its original purpose and pressed into the service of the spirit of antiquity.
In no other point perhaps is the hellenisation of the Gospel so evident as in this. To mention
only one other example, this is also shown in the practice of child communion, which, though
we first hear of it in Cyprian (Testim. III. 25; de laps. 25), can hardly be of later origin
than child baptism. Partaking of the Supper seemed quite as indispensable as baptism, and the
child had no less claim than the adult to a magical food from heaven.[298]

       *       *       *       *       *

In the course of the third century a crass superstition became developed in respect to the
conceptions of the Church and the mysteries connected with her. According to this notion we
must subject ourselves to the Church and must have ourselves filled with holy consecrations
as we are filled with food. But the following chapters will show that this superstition and
mystery magic were counterbalanced by a most lively conception of the freedom and responsibility
of the individual. Fettered by the bonds of authority and superstition in the sphere of religion,
free and self-dependent in the province of morality, this Christianity is characterised by
passive submission in the first respect and by complete activity in the second. It may be that
exegetical theology can never advance beyond an alternation between these two aspects of the
case, and a recognition of their equal claim to consideration; for the religious phenomenon
in which they are combined defies any explanation. But religion is in danger of being destroyed
when the insufficiency of the understanding is elevated into a convenient principle of theory
and life, and when the real mystery of the faith, viz., how one becomes a new man, must accordingly
give place to the injunction that we must obediently accept the religious as a consecration,
and add to this the zealous endeavour after ascetic virtue. Such, however, has been the character
of Catholicism since the third century, and even after Augustine's time it has still remained
the same in its practice.

EXCURSUS TO CHAPTERS II. AND III.

CATHOLIC AND ROMAN.[299]

In investigating the development of Christianity up till about the year 270 the following facts
must be specially kept in mind: In the regions subject to Rome, apart from the Judæo-Christian
districts and passing disturbances, Christianity had yet an undivided history in vital questions;[300]
the independence of individual congregations and of the provincial groups of Churches was very
great; and every advance in the development of the communities at the same time denoted a forward
step in their adaptation to the existing conditions of the Empire. The first two facts we have
mentioned have their limitations. The further apart the different Churches lay, the more various
were the conditions under which they arose and flourished; the looser the relations between
the towns in which they had their home the looser also was the connection between them. Still,
it is evident that towards the end of the third century the development in the Church had well-nigh
attained the same point everywhere--except in outlying communities. Catholicism, essentially
as we conceive it now, was what most of the Churches had arrived at. Now it is an a priori
probability that this transformation of Christianity, which was simply the adaptation of the
Gospel to the then existing Empire, came about under the guidance of the metropolitan Church,[301]
the Church of Rome; and that "Roman" and "Catholic" had therefore a special relation from the
beginning. It might a limine be objected to this proposition that there is no direct testimony
in support of it, and that, apart from this consideration, it is also improbable, in so far
as, in view of the then existing condition of society, Catholicism appears as the natural and
only possible form in which Christianity could be adapted to the world. But this is not the
case; for in the first place very strong proofs can be adduced, and besides, as is shown by
the development in the second century, very different kinds of secularisation were possible.
In fact, if all appearances are not deceptive, the Alexandrian Church, for example, was up
to the time of Septimius Severus pursuing a path of development which, left to itself, would
not have led to Catholicism, but, in the most favourable circumstances, to a parallel form.[302]

It can, however, be proved that it was in the Roman Church, which up to about the year 190
was closely connected with that of Asia Minor, that all the elements on which Catholicism is
based first assumed a definite form.[303] (1) We know that the Roman Church possessed a precisely
formulated baptismal confession, and that as early as the year 180 she declared this to be
the apostolic rule by which everything is to be measured. It is only in her case that we are
really certain of this, for we can merely guess at it as regards the Church of Smyrna, that
is, of Asia Minor. It was accordingly admitted that the Roman Church was able to distinguish
true from false with special exactness;[304] and Irenæus and Tertullian appealed to her to
decide the practice in Gaul and Africa. This practice, in its precisely developed form, cannot
be shown to have existed in Alexandria till a later period; but Origen, who testifies to it,
also bears witness to the special reverence for and connection with the Roman Church. (2) The
New Testament canon, with its claim to be accounted catholic and apostolic and to possess exclusive
authority is first traceable in her; in the other communities it can only be proved to exist
at a later period. In the great Antiochian diocese there was, for instance, a Church some of
whose members wished the Gospel of Peter read; in the Pentapolis group of congregations the
Gospel of the Egyptians was still used in the 3rd century; Syrian Churches of the same epoch
used Tatian's Diatessaron; and the original of the first six books of the Apostolic Constitutions
still makes no mention of a New Testament canon. Though Clement of Alexandria no doubt testifies
that, in consequence of the common history of Christianity, the group of Scriptures read in
the Roman congregations was also the same as that employed in public worship at Alexandria,
he had as yet no New Testament canon before him in the sense of Irenæus and Tertullian. It
was not till Origen's time that Alexandria reached the stage already attained in Rome about
forty years earlier. It must, however, be pointed out that a series of New Testament books,
in the form now found in the canon and universally recognised, show marks of revision that
can be traced back to the Roman Church.[305] Finally, the later investigations, which show
that after the third century the Western readings, that is, the Roman text, of the New Testament
were adopted in the Oriental MSS. of the Bible,[306] are of the utmost value here; for the
most natural explanation of these facts is that the Eastern Churches then received their New
Testament from Rome and used it to correct their copies of books read in public worship.[307]
(3) Rome is the first place which we can prove to have constructed a list of bishops reaching
back to the Apostles (see Irenæus).[308] We know that in the time of Heliogabalus such lists
also existed in other communities; but it cannot be proved that these had already been drawn
up by the time of Marcus Aurelius or Commodus, as was certainly the case at Rome. (4) The notion
of the apostolic succession of the episcopate[309] was first turned to account by the Roman
bishops, and they were the first who definitely formulated the political idea of the Church
in connection with this. The utterances and corresponding practical measures of Victor,[310]
Calixtus (Hippolytus), and Stephen are the earliest of their kind; whilst the precision and
assurance with which they substituted the political and clerical for the ideal conception of
the Church, or amalgamated the two notions, as well as the decided way in which they proclaimed
the sovereignty of the bishops, were not surpassed in the third century by Cyprian himself.
(5) Rome was the first place, and that at a very early period, to date occurrences according
to her bishops; and, even outside that city, churches reckoned, not according to their own,
but according to the Roman episcopate.[311] (6) The Oriental Churches say that two bishops
of Rome compiled the chief apostolic regulations for the organisation of the Church; and this
is only partially wrong.[312] (7) The three great theologians of the age, Tertullian, Hippolytus,
and Origen, opposed the pretensions of the Roman bishop Calixtus; and this very attitude of
theirs testified that the advance in the political organisation of the Church, denoted by the
measures of Calixtus, was still an unheard-of novelty, but immediately exercised a very important
influence on the attitude of other Churches. We know that the other communities imitated this
advance in the succeeding decades. (8) The institution of lower orders of clergy with the corresponding
distinction of clerici maiores and minores first took place in Rome; but we know that this
momentous arrangement gradually spread from that city to the rest of Christendom.[313] (9)
The different Churches communicated with one another through the medium of Rome.[314]

From these considerations we can scarcely doubt that the fundamental apostolic institutions
and laws of Catholicism were framed in the same city that in other respects imposed its authority
on the whole earth; and that it was the centre from which they spread, because the world had
become accustomed to receive law and justice from Rome.[315] But it may be objected that the
parallel development in other provinces and towns was spontaneous, though it everywhere came
about at a somewhat later date. Nor do we intend to contest the assumption in this general
sense; but, as I think, it can be proved that the Roman community had a direct and important
share in the process and that, even in the second century, she was reckoned the first and most
influential Church.[316] We shall give a bird's-eye view of the most important facts bearing
on the question, in order to prove this.

No other community made a more brilliant entrance into Church history than did that of Rome
by the so called First Epistle of Clement--Paul having already testified (Rom. I. 8) that the
faith of this Church was spoken of throughout the whole world. That letter to the Corinthians
proves that, by the end of the first century, the Roman Church had already drawn up fixed rules
for her own guidance, that she watched with motherly care over outlying communities, and that
she then knew how to use language that was at once an expression of duty, love, and authority.[317]
As yet she pretends to no legal title of any kind, but she knows the "commandments and ordinances"
([Greek: prostagmata] and [Greek: dokaiômata]) of God, whereas the conduct of the sister Church
evinces her uncertainty on the matter; she is in an orderly condition, whereas the sister community
is threatened with dissolution; she adheres to the [Greek: kanôn tês paradoseôs], whilst the
other body stands in need of exhortation;[318] and in these facts her claim to authority consists.
The Shepherd of Hermas also proves that even in the circles of the laity the Roman Church is
impressed with the consciousness that she must care for the whole of Christendom. The first
testimony of an outsider as to this community is afforded us by Ignatius. Soften as we may
all the extravagant expressions in his Epistle to the Romans, it is at least clear that Ignatius
conceded to them a precedence in the circle of sister Churches; and that he was well acquainted
with the energy and activity displayed by them in aiding and instructing other communities.[319]
Dionysius of Corinth, in his letter to bishop Soter, affords us a glimpse of the vast activity
manifested by the Christian Church of the world's metropolis on behalf of all Christendom and
of all brethren far and near; and reveals to us the feelings of filial affection and veneration
with which she was regarded in all Greece as well as in Antioch. This author has specially
emphasised the fact that the Roman Christians are Romans, that is, are conscious of the particular
duties incumbent on them as members of the metropolitan Church.[320] After this evidence we
cannot wonder that Irenæus expressly assigned to the Church of Rome the highest rank among
those founded by the Apostles.[321] His famous testimony has been quite as often under as over-estimated.
Doubtless his reference to the Roman Church is introduced in such a way that she is merely
mentioned by way of example, just as he also adds the allusion to Smyrna and Ephesus; but there
is quite as little doubt that this example was no arbitrary selection. The truth rather is
that the Roman community must have been named, because its decision was already the most authoritative
and impressive in Christendom.[322] Whilst giving a formal scheme of proof that assigned the
same theoretical value to each Church founded by the Apostles, Irenæus added a reference to
particular circumstance, viz., that in his time many communities turned to Rome in order to
testify their orthodoxy.[323] As soon as we cease to obscure our vision with theories and keep
in view the actual circumstances, we have no cause for astonishment. Considering the active
intercourse between the various Churches and the metropolis, it was of the utmost importance
to all, especially so long as they required financial aid, to be in connection with that of
Rome, to receive support from her, to know she would entertain travelling brethren, and to
have the power of recommending prisoners and those pining in the mines to her influential intervention.
The evidence of Ignatius and Dionysius as well as the Marcia-Victor episode place this beyond
doubt (see above). The efforts of Marcion and Valentinus in Rome have also a bearing on this
question, and the venerable bishop, Polycarp, did not shrink from the toil of a long journey
to secure the valuable fellowship of the Roman Church;[324] it was not Anicetus who came to
Polycarp, but Polycarp to Anicetus. At the time when the controversy with Gnosticism ensued,
the Roman Church showed all the rest an example of resolution; it was naturally to be expected
that, as a necessary condition of mutual fellowship, she should require other communities to
recognise the law by which she had regulated her own circumstances. No community in the Empire
could regard with indifference its relationship to the great Roman Church; almost everyone
had connections with her; she contained believers from all the rest. As early as 180 this Church
could point to a series of bishops reaching in uninterrupted succession from the glorious apostles
Paul and Peter[325] down to the present time; and she alone maintained a brief but definitely
formulated lex, which she entitled the summary of apostolic tradition, and by reference to
which she decided all questions of faith with admirable certainty. Theories were incapable
of overcoming the elementary differences that could not but appear as soon as Christianity
became naturalised in the various provinces and towns of the Empire. Nor was it theories that
created the empiric unity of the Churches, but the unity which the Empire possessed in Rome;
the extent and composition of the Græco-Latin community there; the security--and this was not
the least powerful element--that accompanied the development of this great society, well provided
as it was with wealth and possessed of an influence in high quarters already dating from the
first century;[326] as well as the care which it displayed on behalf of all Christendom. All
these causes combined to convert the Christian communities into a real confederation under
the primacy of the Roman Church (and subsequently under the leadership of her bishops). This
primacy cannot of course be further defined, for it was merely a de facto one. But, from the
nature of the case, it was immediately shaken, when it was claimed as a legal right associated
with the person of the Roman bishop.

That this theory is more than a hypothesis is shown by several facts which prove the unique
authority as well as the interference of the Roman Church (that is, of her bishop). First,
in the Montanist controversy--and that too at the stage when it was still almost exclusively
confined to Asia Minor--the already sobered adherents of the new prophecy petitioned Rome (bishop
Eleutherus) to recognise their Church, and it was at Rome that the Gallic confessors cautiously
interfered in their behalf; after which a native of Asia Minor induced the Roman bishop to
withdraw the letters of toleration already issued.[327] In view of the facts that it was not
Roman Montanists who were concerned, that Rome was the place where the Asiatic members of this
sect sought for recognition, and that it was in Rome that the Gauls interfered in their behalf,
the significance of this proceeding cannot be readily minimised. We cannot of course dogmatise
on the matter; but the fact can be proved that the decision of the Roman Church must have settled
the position of that sect of enthusiasts in Christendom. Secondly, what is reported to us of
Victor, the successor of Eleutherus, is still plainer testimony. He ventured to issue an edict,
which we may already style a peremptory one, proclaiming the Roman practice with regard to
the regulation of ecclesiastical festivals to be the universal rule in the Church, and declaring
that every congregation, that failed to adopt the Roman arrangement,[328] was excluded from
the union of the one Church on the ground of heresy. How would Victor have ventured on such
an edict--though indeed he had not the power of enforcing it in every case--unless the special
prerogative of Rome to determine the conditions of the "common unity" ([Greek: koinê henôsis])
in the vital questions of the faith had been an acknowledged and well-established fact? How
could Victor have addressed such a demand to the independent Churches, if he had not been recognised,
in his capacity of bishop of Rome, as the special guardian of the [Greek: koinê henôsis]?[329]
Thirdly, it was Victor who formally excluded Theodotus from Church fellowship. This is the
first really well-attested case of a Christian taking his stand on the rule of faith being
excommunicated because a definite interpretation of it was already insisted on. In this instance
the expression [Greek: huios monogenês] (only begotten Son) was required to be understood in
the sense of [Greek: Phusei Theos] (God by nature). It was in Rome that this first took place.
Fourthly, under Zephyrinus, Victor's successor, the Roman ecclesiastics interfered in the Carthaginian
veil dispute, making common cause with the local clergy against Tertullian; and both appealed
to the authority of predecessors, that is, above all, of the Roman bishops.[330] Tertullian,
Hippolytus, Origen, and Cyprian were obliged to resist the pretensions of these ecclesiastics
to authority outside their own Church, the first having to contend with Calixtus, and the three
others with Stephen.[331]

It was the Roman Church that first displayed this activity and care; the Roman bishop sprang
from the community in exactly the same way as the corresponding official did in other places.[332]
In Irenæus' proof from prescription, however, it is already the Roman bishops that are specially
mentioned.[333] Praxeas reminded the bishop of Rome of the authority of his predecessors ("auctoritates
præcessorum eius") and it was in the character of bishop that Victor acted. The assumption
that Paul and Peter laboured in Rome, that is, founded the Church of that city (Dionysius,
Irenæus, Tertullian, Caius), must have conferred a high degree of prestige on her bishops,
as soon as the latter officials were elevated to the position of more or less sovereign lords
of the communities and were regarded as successors of the Apostles. The first who acted up
to this idea was Calixtus. The sarcastic titles of "pontifex maximus," "episcopus episcoporum,"
"benedictus papa" and "apostolicus," applied to him by Tertullian in "de pudicitia" I. 13,
are so many references to the fact that Calixtus already claimed for himself a position of
primacy, in other words, that he associated with his own personal position as bishop the primacy
possessed by the Roman Church, which pre-eminence, however, must have been gradually vanishing
in proportion to the progress of the Catholic form of organisation among the other communities.
Moreover, that is evident from the form of the edict he issued (Tert. I. c., I: "I hear that
an edict has been issued and that a decisive one," "audio edictum esse præpositum et quidem
peremptorium"), from the grounds it assigned and from the opposition to it on the part of Tertullian.
From the form, in so far as Calixtus acted here quite independently and, without previous consultation,
issued a peremptory edict, that is, one settling the matter and immediately taking effect;
from the grounds it assigned, in so far as he appealed in justification of his action to Matt.
XVI. 18 ff.[334]--the first instance of the kind recorded in history; from Tertullian's opposition
to it, because the latter treats it not as local, Roman, but as pregnant in consequences for
all Christendom. But, as soon as the question took the form of enquiring whether the Roman
bishop was elevated above the rest, a totally new situation arose. Even in the third century,
as already shown, the Roman community, led by its bishops, still showed the rest an example
in the process of giving a political constitution to the Church. It can also be proved that
even far distant congregations were still being bound to the Roman Church through financial
support,[335] and that she was appealed to in questions of faith, just as the law of the city
of Rome was invoked as the standard in civil questions.[336] It is further manifest from Cyprian's
epistles that the Roman Church was regarded as the ecclesia principalis, as the guardian par
excellence of the unity of the Church. We may explain from Cyprian's own particular situation
all else that he said in praise of the Roman Church (see above p. 88, note 2) and specially
of the cathedra Petri; but the general view that she is the "matrix et radix ecclesiæ catholicæ"
is not peculiar to him, and the statement that the "unitas sacerdotalis" originated in Rome
is merely the modified expression, necessitated by the altered circumstances of the Church,
for the acknowledged fact that the Roman community was the most distinguished among the sister
groups, and as such had had and still possessed the right and duty of watching over the unity
of the whole. Cyprian himself no doubt took a further step at the time of his correspondence
with Cornelius, and proclaimed the special reference of Matt. XVI. to the cathedra Petri; but
he confined his theory to the abstractions "ecclesia," "cathedra." In him the importance of
this cathedra oscillates between the significance of a once existent fact that continues to
live on as a symbol, and that of a real and permanent court of appeal. Moreover, he did not
go the length of declaring that any special authority within the collective Church attached
to the temporary occupant of the cathedra Petri. If we remove from Cyprian's abstractions everything
to which he himself thinks there is nothing concrete corresponding, then we must above all
eliminate every prerogative of the Roman bishop for the time being. What remains behind is
the special position of the Roman Church, which indeed is represented by her bishop. Cyprian
can say quite frankly: "owing to her magnitude Rome ought to have precedence over Carthage"
("pro magnitudine sua debet Carthaginem Roma præcedere") and his theory: "the episcopate is
one, and a part of it is held by each bishop for the whole" 4). Here we have reached the point
that has already been briefly referred to above, viz., that the consolidation of the Churches
in the Empire after the Roman pattern could not but endanger the prestige and peculiar position
of Rome, and did in fact do so. If we consider that each bishop was the acknowledged sovereign
of his own diocese--now Catholic, that all bishops, as such, were recognised to be successors
of the Apostles, that, moreover, the attribute of priesthood occupied a prominent position
in the conception of the episcopal office, and that, the metropolitan unions with their presidents
and synods had become completely naturalised--in short, that the rigid episcopal and provincial
constitution of the Church had become an accomplished fact, so that, ultimately, it was no
longer communities, but merely bishops that had dealings with each other, then we shall see
that a new situation was thereby created for Rome, that is, for her bishop. In the West it
was perhaps chiefly through the coöperation of Cyprian that Rome found herself face to face
with a completely organised Church system. His behaviour in the controversy about heretical
baptism proves that in cases of dispute he was resolved to elevate his theory of the sovereign
authority of each bishop above his theory of the necessary connection with the cathedra Petri.
But, when that levelling of the episcopate came about, Rome had already acquired rights that
could no longer be cancelled.[337] Besides, there was one thing that could not be taken from
the Roman Church, nor therefore from her bishop, even if she were denied the special right
to Matt. XVI., viz., the possession of Rome. The site of the world's metropolis might be shifted,
but Rome could not be removed. In the long run, however, the shifting of the capital proved
advantageous to ecclesiastical Rome. At the beginning of the great epoch when the alienation
of East from West became pronounced and permanent, an emperor, from political grounds, decided
in favour of that party in Antioch "with whom the bishops in Italy and the city of the Romans
held intercourse" ([Greek: hois an hoi kata tên Italian kai tên Rhômaiôn polin episkopoi tou
dogmatos epistelloien][338]). In this instance the interest of the Roman Church and the interest
of the emperor coincided. But the Churches in the various provinces, being now completely organised
and therefore seldom in need of any more help from outside, were henceforth in a position to
pursue their own interest. So the bishop of Rome had step by step to fight for the new authority,
which, being now based on a purely dogmatic theory and being forced to repudiate any empirical
foundation, was inconsistent with the Church system that the Roman community more than any
other had helped to build up. The proposition "the Roman Church always had the primacy" ("ecclesia
Romana semper habuit primatum") and the statement that "Catholic" virtually means "Roman Catholic"
are gross fictions, when devised in honour of the temporary occupant of the Roman see and detached
from the significance of the Eternal City in profane history; but, applied to the Church of
the imperial capital, they contain a truth the denial of which is equivalent to renouncing
the attempt to explain the process by which the Church was unified and catholicised.[339]

[Footnote 194: In certain vital points the conception of the original nature and history of
Montanism, as sketched in the following account, does not correspond with that traditionally
current. To establish it in detail would lead us too far. It may be noted that the mistakes
in estimating the original character of this movement arise from a superficial examination
of the oracles preserved to us and from the unjustifiable practice of interpreting them in
accordance with their later application in the circles of Western Montanists. A completely
new organisation of Christendom, beginning with the Church in Asia, to be brought about by
its being detached from the bonds of the communities and collected into one region, was the
main effort of Montanus. In this way he expected to restore to the Church a spiritual character
and fulfil the promises contained in John. That is clear from Euseb., V. 16 ff. as well as
from the later history of Montanism in its native land (see Jerome, ep. 41; Epiphan., H. 49.
2 etc.). In itself, however, apart from its particular explanation in the case of Montanus,
the endeavour to detach Christians from the local Church unions has so little that is striking
about it, that one rather wonders at being unable to point to any parallel in the earliest
history of the Church. Wherever religious enthusiasm has been strong, it has at all times felt
that nothing hinders its effect more than family ties and home connections. But it is just
from the absence of similar undertakings in the earliest Christianity that we are justified
in concluding that the strength of enthusiastic exaltation is no standard for the strength
of Christian faith. (Since these words were written, we have read in Hippolytus' Commentary
on Daniel [see Georgiades in the journal [Greek: Ekkl. alêtheia] 1885, p. 52 sq.] very interesting
accounts of such undertakings in the time of Septimius Severus. A Syrian bishop persuaded many
brethren with wives and children to go to meet Christ in the wilderness; and another in Pontus
induced his people to sell all their possessions, to cease tilling their lands, to conclude
no more marriages etc., because the coming of the Lord was nigh at hand.)]

[Footnote 195: Oracle of Prisca in Epiph. H. 49. 1.]

[Footnote 196: Even in its original home Montanism must have accommodated itself to circumstances
at a comparatively early date--which is not in the least extraordinary. No doubt the Montanist
Churches in Asia and Phrygia, to which the bishop of Rome had already issued literæ pacis,
were now very different from the original followers of the prophets (Tertull., adv. Prax. 1).
When Tertullian further reports that Praxeas at the last moment prevented them from being recognised
by the bishop of Rome, "falsa de ipsis prophetis et ecclesiis eorum adseverando," the "falsehood
about the Churches" may simply have consisted in an account of the original tendencies of the
Montanist sect. The whole unique history which, in spite of this, Montanism undoubtedly passed
through in its original home is, however explained by the circumstance that there were districts
there, where all Christians belonged to that sect (Epiph., H. 51. 33; cf. also the later history
of Novatianism). In their peculiar Church organisation (patriarchs, stewards, bishops), these
sects preserved a record of their origin.]

[Footnote 197: Special weight must be laid on this. The fact that whole communities became
followers of the new prophets, who nevertheless adhered to no old regulation, must above all
be taken into account.]

[Footnote 198: See Oracles 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 17, 18, 21 in Bonwetsch, l.c., p. 197 f. It
can hardly have been customary for Christian prophets to speak like Montanus (Nos. 3-5): [Greek:
egô kyrios ho theos ho pantokratôr kataginomenos en anthropô], or [Greek: egô kyrios ho theos
patêr êlthon,] or [Greek: egô eimi ho patêr kai ho uios kai ho paraklêtos], though Old Testament
prophecy takes an analogous form. Maximilla says on one occasion (No. 11); [Greek: apesteile
me kyrios toutou tou ponou kai tês epangelias airetistên]; and a second time (No. 12): [Greek:
diôkomai hôs lycos ek probatôn ouk eimi lycos; rhêma eimi kai pneuma kai dynamis.] The two
utterances do not exclude, but include, one another (cf. also No. 10: [Greek: emou mê akousête
alla Christou akousate]). From James IV. V. and Hermas, and from the Didache, on the other
hand, we can see how the prophets of Christian communities may have usually spoken.]

[Footnote 199: L.c., no. 9: [Greek: Christos hen idea gynaikos eschêmatismenos.] How variable
must the misbirths of the Christian imagination have been in this respect also! Unfortunately
almost everything of that kind has been lost to us because it has been suppressed. The fragments
of the once highly esteemed Apocalypse of Peter are instructive, for they still attest that
the existing remains of early Christian literature are not able to give a correct picture of
the strength of religious imagination in the first and second centuries. The passages where
Christophanies are spoken of in the earliest literature would require to be collected. It would
be shown what naive enthusiasm existed. Jesus appears to believers as a child, as a boy, as
a youth, as Paul etc. Conversely, glorified men appear in visions with the features of Christ.]

[Footnote 200: See Euseb., H. E. V. 16. 9. In Oracle No. 2 an evangelical promise is repeated
in a heightened form; but see Papias in Iren., V. 33. 3 f.]

[Footnote 201: We may unhesitatingly act on the principle that the Montanist elements, as they
appear in Tertullian, are, in all cases, found not in a strengthened, but a weakened, form.
So, when even Tertullian still asserts that the Paraclete in the new prophets could overturn
or change, and actually did change, regulations of the Apostles, there is no doubt that the
new prophets themselves did not adhere to apostolic dicta and had no hesitation in deviating
from them. Cf., moreover, the direct declarations on this point in Hippolytus (Syntagma and
Philos. VIII. 19) and in Didymus (de trin. III. 41. 2).]

[Footnote 202: The precepts for a Christian life, if we may so speak, given by the new prophets,
cannot be determined from the compromises on which the discipline of the later Montanist societies
of the Empire were based. Here they sought for a narrow line between the Marcionite and Encratite
mode of life and the common church practice, and had no longer the courage and the candour
to proclaim the "e sæculo excedere." Sexual purity and the renunciation of the enjoyments of
life were the demands of the new prophets. But it is hardly likely that they prescribed precise
"laws," for the primary matter was not asceticism, but the realising of a promise. In later
days it was therefore possible to conceive the most extreme demands as regulations referring
to none but the prophets themselves, and to tone down the oracles in their application to believers.
It is said of Montanus himself (Euseb., H. E. V. 18. 2): [Greek: ho didaxas lyseis gamôn, ho
nêsteias nomothetêsas]; Prisca was a [Greek: parthenos] (l.c. § 3); Proculus, the chief of
the Roman Montanists, "virginis senectæ" (Tert., adv. Val. 5). The oracle of Prisca (No. 8)
declares that sexual purity is the preliminary condition for the oracles and visions of God;
it is presupposed in the case of every "sanctus minister." Finally, Origen tells us (in Titum,
Opp. IV. 696) that the (older) Cataphrygians said: "ne accedas ad me, quoniam mundus sum; non
enim accepi uxorem, nec est sepulcrum patens guttur menin, sed sum Nazarenus dei non bibens
vinum sicut illi." But an express legal direction to abolish marriage cannot have existed in
the collection of oracles possessed by Tertullian. But who can guarantee that they were not
already corrected? Such an assumption, however, is not necessary.]

[Footnote 203: Euseb., V. 16. 9: V. 18. 5.]

[Footnote 204: It will not do simply to place Montanus and his two female associates in the
same category as the prophets of primitive Christian Churches. The claim that the Spirit had
descended upon them in unique fashion must have been put forth by themselves with unmistakable
clearness. If we apply the principle laid down on p. 98, note 3, we will find that--apart from
the prophets' own utterances--this is still clearly manifest from the works of Tertullian.
A consideration of the following facts will remove all doubt as to the claim of the new prophets
to the possession of an unique mission, (1) From the beginning both opponents and followers
constantly applied the title "New Prophecy" to the phenomenon in question (Euseb., V. 16. 4:
V. 19. 2; Clem., Strom. IV. 13. 93; Tertull., monog. 14, ieiun. I, resurr. 63, Marc. III. 24.:
IV. 22, Prax. 30; Firmil. ep. 75. 7; alii). (2) Similarly, the divine afflatus was, from the
first, constantly designated as the "Paraclete" (Orac. no. 5; Tertull. passim; Hippol. passim;
Didymus etc.). (3) Even in the third century the Montanist congregations of the Empire must
still have doubted whether the Apostles had possessed this Paraclete or not, or at least whether
this had been the case in the full sense. Tertullian identifies the Spirit and the Paraclete
and declares that the Apostles possessed the latter in full measure--in fact as a Catholic
he could not do otherwise. Nevertheless he calls Montanus etc. "prophetæ proprii" of the Spirit
(pudic. 12; see Acta Perpet. 21). On the contrary we find in Philos. VIII. 19: [Greek: huper
de apostolous kai pan charisma tauta ta gunaia doxazouin, hôs tolman pleion ti Christou en
toutois legein tinas autôn gegoneai]. Pseudo-Tertullian says: "in apostolis quidem dicunt spiritum
sanctum fuisse, paracletum non fuisse, et paracletum plura in Montano dixisse quam Christum
in evangelio protulisse." In Didymus, l.c., we read: [Greek: tou apostolou grapsantos k.t.l.,
ekeinoi legousin ton Montanon elêluthenai kai eschêkenai to teleion to tou paraklêton, tout'
estin to tou agion pneumatos]. (4) Lastly, the Montanists asserted that the prediction contained
in John XIV. ff. had been fulfilled in the new prophecy, and that from the beginning, as is
denoted by the very expression "Paraclete."

What sort of mission they ascribed to themselves is seen from the last quoted passage, for
the promises contained in it must be regarded as the enthusiastic carrying out of Montanus'
programme. If we read attentively John XIV. 16-21, 23, 26: XV. 20-26: XVI. 7-15, 25 as well
as XVII. and X.; if we compare the oracles of the prophets still preserved to us; if we consider
the attempt of Montanus to gather the scattered Christians and really form them into a flock,
and also his claim to be the bearer of the greatest and last revelations that lead to all truth;
and, finally, if we call to mind that in those Johannine discourses Christ designated the coming
of the Paraclete as his own coming in the Paraclete and spoke of an immanence and unity of
Father, Son, and Paraclete, which one finds re-echoed in Montanus' Oracle No. V., we cannot
avoid concluding that the latter's undertaking is based on the impression made on excited and
impatient prophets by the promises contained in the Gospel of John, understood in an apocalyptic
and realistic sense, and also by Matt. XXIII. 34 (see Euseb., V. 16. 12 sq.). The correctness
of this interpretation is proved by the fact that the first decided opponents of the Montanists
in Asia--the so-called "Alogi" (Epiph., H. 51)--rejected both the Gospel and Revelation of
John, that is, regarded them as written by some one else. Montanism therefore shows us the
first and--up till about 180--really the only impression made by the Gospel of John on non-Gnostic
Gentile Christians; and what a remarkable one it was! It has a parallel in Marcion's conception
of Paulinism. Here we obtain glimpses of a state of matters which probably explains why these
writings were made innocuous in the canon. To the view advanced here it cannot be objected
that the later adherents of the new prophets founded their claims on the recognised gift of
prophecy in the Church, or on a prophetic succession (Euseb, H. E. V. 17. 4; Proculus in the
same author, II. 25. 7: III. 31. 4), nor that Tertullian, when it suits him, simply regards
the new prophecy as a restitutio (e.g., in Monog. 4); for these assumptions merely represent
the unsuccessful attempt to legitimise this phenomenon within the Catholic Church. In proof
of the fact that Montanus appealed to the Gospel of John see Jerome, Ep. 41 (Migne I. p. 474),
which begins with the words: "Testimonia de Johannis evangelio congregata, quæ tibi quidam
Montani sectator ingessit, in quibus salvator noster se ad patrem iturum missurumque paracletum
pollicetur etc." In opposition to this Jerome argues that the promises about the Paraclete
are fulfilled in Acts II., as Peter said in his speech, and then continues as follows: "Quodsi
voluerint respondere et Philippi deinceps quattuor filias prophetasse et prophetam Agabum reperiri
et in divisionibus spiritus inter apostolos et doctores et prophetas quoque apostolo scribente
formatos. etc."]

[Footnote 205: We are assured of this not only by Tertullian, but also by the Roman Montanist
Proculus, who, like the former, argued against heretics, and by the testimony of the Church
Fathers (see, e.g., Philos. VIII. 19). It was chiefly on the ground of their orthodoxy that
Tertullian urged the claim of the new prophets to a hearing; and it was, above all, as a Montanist
that he felt himself capable of combating the Gnostics, since the Paraclete not only confirmed
the regula, but also by unequivocal utterances cleared up ambiguous and obscure passages in
the Holy Scriptures, and (as was asserted) completely rejected doctrines like the Monarchian
(see fuga 1, 14; corona 4; virg. vel. 1: Prax. 2, 13, 30; resurr. 63; pud. 1; monog. 2; ieiun.
10, II). Besides, we see from Tertullian's writings that the secession of the Montanist conventicles
from the Church was forced upon them.]

[Footnote 206: The question as to whether the new prophecy had or had not to be recognised
as such became the decisive one (fuga 1, 14; coron. 1; virg. vel. 1; Prax. 1: pudic. 11; monog.
1). This prophecy was recorded in writing (Euseb., V. 18. 1; Epiph., H. 48. 10; Euseb., VI.
20). The putting of this question, however, denoted a fundamental weakening of conviction,
which was accompanied by a corresponding falling off in the application of the prophetic utterances.]

[Footnote 207: The situation that preceded the acceptance of the new prophecy in a portion
of Christendom may be studied in Tertullian's writings "de idolol." and "de spectac." Christianity
had already been conceived as a nova lex throughout the whole Church, and this lex had, moreover,
been clearly defined in its bearing on the faith. But, as regards outward conduct, there was
no definite lex, and arguments in favour both of strictness and of laxity were brought forward
from the Holy Scriptures. No divine ordinances about morality could be adduced against the
progressive secularising of Christianity; but there was need of statutory commandments by which
all the limits were clearly defined. In this state of perplexity the oracles of the new prophets
were gladly welcomed; they were utilised in order to justify and invest with divine authority
a reaction of a moderate kind. More than that--as may be inferred from Tertullian's unwilling
confession--could not be attained; but it is well known that even this result was not reached.
Thus the Phrygian movement was employed in support of undertakings, that had no real connection
with it. But this was the form in which Montanism first became a factor in the history of the
Church. To what extent it had been so before, particularly as regards the creation of a New
Testament canon (in Asia Minor and Rome), cannot be made out with certainty.]

[Footnote 208: See Bonwetsch, l.c., p. 82-108.]

[Footnote 209: This is the point about which Tertullian's difficulties are greatest. Tatian
is expressly repudiated in de ieiun. 15.]

[Footnote 210: Tertullian (de monog.) is not deterred by such a limitation: "qui potest capere
capiat, inquit, id est qui non potest discedat."]

[Footnote 211: It is very instructive, but at the same time very painful, to trace Tertullian's
endeavours to reconcile the irreconcilable, in other words, to show that the prophecy is new
and yet not so; that it does not impair the full authority of the New Testament and yet supersedes
it. He is forced to maintain the theory that the Paraclete stands in the same relation to the
Apostles as Christ does to Moses, and that he abrogates the concessions made by the Apostles
and even by Christ himself; whilst he is at the same time obliged to reassert the sufficiency
of both Testaments. In connection with this he hit upon the peculiar theory of stages in revelation--a
theory which, were it not a mere expedient in his case, one might regard as the first faint
trace of a historical view of the question. Still, this is another case of a dilemma, furnishing
theology with a conception that she has cautiously employed in succeeding times, when brought
face to face with certain difficulties; see virg. vel. I; exhort. 6; monog. 2, 3, 14; resurr.
63. For the rest, Tertullian is at bottom a Christian of the old stamp; the theory of any sort
of finality in revelation is of no use to him except in its bearing on heresy; for the Spirit
continually guides to all truth and works wherever he will. Similarly, his only reason for
not being an Encratite is that this mode of life had already been adopted by heretics, and
become associated with dualism. But the conviction that all religion must have the character
of a fixed law and presupposes definite regulations--a belief not emanating from primitive
Christianity, but from Rome--bound him to the Catholic Church. Besides, the contradictions
with which he struggled were by no means peculiar to him; in so far as the Montanist societies
accepted the Catholic regulations, they weighed on them all, and in all probability crushed
them out of existence. In Asia Minor, where the breach took place earlier, the sect held its
ground longer. In North Africa the residuum was a remarkable propensity to visions, holy dreams,
and the like. The feature which forms the peculiar characteristic of the Acts of Perpetua and
Felicitas is still found in a similar shape in Cyprian himself, who makes powerful use of visions
and dreams; and in the genuine African Acts of the Martyrs, dating from Valerian's time, which
are unfortunately little studied. See, above all, the Acta Jacobi, Mariani etc., and the Acta
Montani, Lucii etc. (Ruinart, Acta Mart. edit Ratisb. 1859, p. 268 sq., p. 275 sq.)]

[Footnote 212: Nothing is known of attempts at a formal incorporation of the Oracles with the
New Testament. Besides, the Montanists could dispense with this because they distinguished
the commandments of the Paraclete as "novissima lex" from the "novum testamentum." The preface
to the Montanist Acts of Perpetua and Felicitas (was Tertullian the author?) showed indeed
the high value attached to the visions of martyrs. In so far as these were to be read in the
Churches they were meant to be reckoned as an "instrumentum ecclesiæ" in the wider sense.]

[Footnote 213: Here the bishops themselves occupy the foreground (there are complaints about
their cowardice and serving of two masters in the treatise de fugo). But it would be very unjust
simply to find fault with them as Tertullian does. Two interests combined to influence their
conduct; for if they drew the reins tight they gave over their flock to heresy or heathenism.
This situation is already evident in Hermas and dominates the resolutions of the Church leaders
in succeeding generations (see below).]

[Footnote 214: The distinction of "Spiritales" and "Psychici" on the part of the Montanists
is not confined to the West (see Clem., Strom. IV. 13. 93); we find it very frequently in Tertullian.
In itself it did not yet lead to the formal breach with the Catholic Church.]

[Footnote 215: A contrast to the bishops and the regular congregational offices existed in
primitive Montanism. This was transmitted in a weakened form to the later adherents of the
new prophecy (cf. the Gallic confessors' strange letter of recommendation on behalf of Irenæus
in Euseb., H. E. V. 4), and finally broke forth with renewed vigour in opposition to the measures
of the lax bishops (de pudic. 21; de exhort. 7; Hippolytus against Calixtus). The ecclesia,
represented as numerus episcoporum, no longer preserved its prestige in the eyes of Tertullian.]

[Footnote 216: See here particularly, de pudicitia 1, where Tertullian sees the virginity of
the Church not in pure doctrine, but in strict precepts for a holy life. As will have been
seen in this account, the oft debated question as to whether Montanism was an innovation or
merely a reaction does not admit of a simple answer. In its original shape it was undoubtedly
an innovation; but it existed at the end of a period when one cannot very well speak of innovations,
because no bounds had yet been set to subjective religiosity. Montanus decidedly went further
than any Christian prophets known to us; Hermas, too, no doubt gave injunctions, as a prophet,
which gave rise to innovations in Christendom; but these fell short of Montanus' proceedings.
In its later shape, however, Montanism was to all intents and purposes a reaction, which aimed
at maintaining or reviving an older state of things. So far, however, as this was to be done
by legislation, by a novissima lex, we have an evident innovation analogous to the Catholic
development. Whereas in former times exalted enthusiasm had of itself, as it were, given rise
to strict principles of conduct among its other results, these principles, formulated with
exactness and detail, were now meant to preserve or produce that original mode of life. Moreover,
as soon as the New Testament was recognised, the conception of a subsequent revelation through
the Paraclete was a highly questionable and strange innovation. But for those who acknowledged
the new prophecy all this was ultimately nothing but a means. Its practical tendency, based
as it was on the conviction that the Church abandons her character if she does not resist gross
secularisation at least, was no innovation, but a defence of the most elementary requirements
of primitive Christianity in opposition to a Church that was always more and more becoming
a new thing.]

[Footnote 217: There were of course a great many intermediate stages between the extremes of
laxity and rigour, and the new prophecy was by no means recognised by all those who had strict
views as to the principles of Christian polity; see the letters of Dionysius of Corinth in
Euseb., H. E. IV. 23. Melito, the prophet, eunuch, and bishop, must also be reckoned as one
of the stricter party, but not as a Montanist. We must judge similarly of Irenæus.]

[Footnote 218: Euseb., H. E. V. 16. 17. The life of the prophets themselves was subsequently
subjected to sharp criticism.]

[Footnote 219: This was first done by the so-called Alogi who, however, had to be repudiated.]

[Footnote 220: De ieiun. 12, 16.]

[Footnote 221: Tertullian protested against this in the most energetic manner.]

[Footnote 222: It is well known that in the 3rd century the Revelation of John itself was viewed
with suspicion and removed from the canon in wide circles in the East.]

[Footnote 223: In the West the Chiliastic hopes were little or not at all affected by the Montanist
struggle. Chiliasm prevailed there in unimpaired strength as late as the 4th century. In the
East, on the contrary, the apocalyptic expectations were immediately weakened by the Montanist
crisis. But it was philosophical theology that first proved their mortal enemy. In the rural
Churches of Egypt Chiliasm was still widely prevalent after the middle of the 3rd century;
see the instructive 24th chapter of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII. "Some of their
teachers," says Dionysius, "look on the Law and the Prophets as nothing, neglect to obey the
Gospel, esteem the Epistles of the Apostles as little worth, but, on the contrary, declare
the doctrine contained in the Revelation of John to be a great and a hidden mystery." There
were even temporary disruptions in the Egyptian Church on account of Chiliasm (see Chap. 24. 6).]

[Footnote 224: "Lex et prophetæ usque ad Johannem" now became the motto. Churchmen spoke of
a "completus numerus prophetarum" (Muratorian Fragment), and formulated the proposition that
the prophets corresponded to the pre-Christian stage of revelation, but the Apostles to the
Christian; and that in addition to this the apostolic age was also particularly distinguished
by gifts of the Spirit. "Prophets and Apostles" now replaced "Apostles, prophets, and teachers,"
as the court of appeal. Under such circumstances prophecy might still indeed exist; but it
could no longer be of a kind capable of ranking, in the remotest degree, with the authority
of the Apostles in point of importance. Hence it was driven into a corner, became extinct,
or at most served only to support the measures of the bishops. In order to estimate the great
revolution in the spirit of the times let us compare the utterances of Irenæus and Origen about
gifts of the Spirit and prophecy. Irenæus still expressed himself exactly like Justin (Dial.
39, 81, 82, 88); he says (II. 32. 4: V. 6. 1): [Greek: kathôs kai pollôn akouomen adelphôn
hen tê ekklêsia prophêtika charismata echontôn k.t.l.] Origen on the contrary (see numerous
passages, especially in the treatise c. Cels.), looks back to a period after which the Spirit's
gifts in the Church ceased. It is also a very characteristic circumstance that along with the
naturalisation of Christianity in the world, the disappearance of charisms, and the struggle
against Gnosticism, a strictly ascetic mode of life came to be viewed with suspicion. Euseb.,
H. E. V. 3 is especially instructive on this point. Here it is revealed to the confessor Attalus
that the confessor Alcibiades, who even in captivity continued his ascetic practice of living
on nothing but bread and water, was wrong in refraining from that which God had created and
thus become a "[Greek: typos skandalou]" to others. Alcibiades changed his mode of life. In
Africa, however, (see above, p. 103) dreams and visions still retained their authority in the
Church as important means of solving perplexities.]

[Footnote 225: Tertullian, adv. Marc. IV. 9, enumerates "septem maculas capitalium delictorum,"
namely, "idololatria," "blasphemia," "homicidium," "adulterium," "stuprum," "falsum testimonium,"
"fraus." The stricter treatment probably applied to all these seven offences. So far as I know,
the lapse into heresy was not placed in the same category in the first centuries; see Iren.
III. 4. 2: Tertull., de præscr. 30 and, above all, de pudic. 19 init.; the anonymous writer
in Euseb., H. E. V. 28. 12, from which passages it is evident that repentant heretics were
readmitted.]

[Footnote 226: Hermas based the admissibility of a second atonement on a definite divine revelation
to this effect, and did not expressly discuss the admission of gross sinners into the Church
generally, but treated of their reception into that of the last days, which he believed had
already arrived. See particulars on this point in my article "Lapsi," in Herzog's Real-Encyklopädie,
2 ed. Cf. Preuschen, Tertullian's Schriften de pænit. et de pudic. mit Rücksicht auf die Bussdisciplin,
1890; Rolffs, Indulgenz-Edict des Kallistus, 1893.]

[Footnote 227: In the work de pænit. (7 ff.) Tertullian treats this as a fixed Church regulation.
K. Müller, Kirchengeschichte I. 1892, p. 114, rightly remarks: "He who desired this expiation
continued in the wider circle of the Church, in her 'antechamber' indeed, but as her member
in the wider sense. This, however, did not exclude the possibility of his being received again,
even in this world, into the ranks of those possessing full Christian privileges,--after the
performance of penance or exhomologesis. But there was no kind of certainty as to that taking
place. Meanwhile this exhomologesis itself underwent a transformation which in Tertullian includes
a whole series of basal religious ideas. It is no longer a mere expression of inward feeling,
confession to God and the brethren, but is essentially performance. It is the actual attestation
of heartfelt sorrow, the undertaking to satisfy God by works of self-humiliation and abnegation,
which he can accept as a voluntarily endured punishment and therefore as a substitute for the
penalty that naturally awaits the sinner. It is thus the means of pacifying God, appeasing
his anger, and gaining his favour again--with the consequent possibility of readmission into
the Church. I say the possibility, for readmission does not always follow. Participation in
the future kingdom may be hoped for even by him who in this world is shut out from full citizenship
and merely remains in the ranks of the penitent. In all probability then it still continued
the rule for a person to remain till death in a state of penance or exhomologesis. For readmission
continued to involve the assumption that the Church had in some way or other become certain
that God had forgiven the sinner, or in other words that she had power to grant this forgiveness
in virtue of the Spirit dwelling in her, and that this readmission therefore involved no violation
of her holiness." In such instances it is first prophets and then martyrs that appear as organs
of the Spirit, till at last it is no longer the inspired Christian, but the professional medium
of the Spirit, viz., the priest, who decides everything.]

[Footnote 228: In the 2nd century even endeavours at a formal repetition of baptism were not
wholly lacking. In Marcionite congregations repetition of baptism is said to have taken place
(on the Elkesaites see Vol. I. p. 308). One can only wonder that there is not more frequent
mention of such attempts. The assertion of Hippolytus (Philos. IX. 12 fin.) is enigmatical:
[Greek: Epi Kallistou protô tetolmêtai deuteron autois baptisma].]

[Footnote 229: See Tertull., de pudic. 12: "hinc est quod neque idololatriæ neque sanguini
pax ab ecclesiis redditur." Orig., de orat. 28 fin; c. Cels. III. 50.]

[Footnote 230: It is only of whoremongers and idolaters that Tertullian expressly speaks in
de pudic. c. I. We must interpret in accordance with this the following statement by Hippolytus
in Philos. IX. 12: [Greek: Kallistos prôtos ta pros tas hêdonas tois anthrôpois synchôrein
epenoêse, legôn pasin hup' autou aphiesthai hamartias]. The aim of this measure is still clear
from the account of it given by Hippolytus, though this indeed is written in a hostile spirit.
Roman Christians were then split into at least five different sects, and Calixtus left nothing
undone to break up the unfriendly parties and enlarge his own. In all probability, too, the
energetic bishop met with a certain measure of success. From Euseb., H. E. IV. 23. 6, one might
be inclined to conclude that, even in Marcus Aurelius' time, Dionysius of Corinth had issued
lax injunctions similar to those of Calixtus. But it must not be forgotten that we have nothing
but Eusebius' report; and it is just in questions of this kind that his accounts are not reliable.]

[Footnote 231: No doubt persecutions were practically unknown in the period between 220 and 260.]

[Footnote 232: See Cypr., de lapsis.]

[Footnote 233: What scruples were caused by this innovation is shown by the first 40 letters
in Cyprian's collection. He himself had to struggle with painful doubts.]

[Footnote 234: Apart from some epistles of Cyprian, Socrates, H. E. V. 22, is our chief source
of information on this point. See also Conc. Illib. can. 1, 2, 6-8, 12, 17, 18-47, 70-73, 75.]

[Footnote 235: See my article "Novatian" in Herzog's Real-Encyklopädie, 2nd ed. One might be
tempted to assume that the introduction of the practice of unlimited forgiveness of sins was
an "evangelical reaction" against the merciless legalism which, in the case of the Gentile
Church indeed, had established itself from the beginning. As a matter of fact the bishops and
the laxer party appealed to the New Testament in justification of their practice. This had
already been done by the followers of Calixtus and by himself. See Philos. IX. 12: [Greek:
phaskontes Christon aphienai tois eudokousi]; Rom. XIV. 4 and Matt. XIII. 29 were also quoted.
Before this Tertullian's opponents who favoured laxity had appealed exactly in the same way
to numerous Bible texts, e.g., Matt. X. 23: XI. 19 etc., see de monog, de pudic., de ieiun.
Cyprian is also able to quote many passages from the Gospels. However, as the bishops and their
party did not modify their conception of baptism, but rather maintained in principle, as before,
that baptism imposes only obligations for the future, the "evangelical reaction" must not be
estimated very highly; (see below, p. 117, and my essay in the Zeitschrift fur Theologie und
Kirche, Vol. I., "Die ehre von der Seligkeit allein durch den Glauben in der alten Kirche.")]

[Footnote 236: The distinction of sins committed against God himself, as we find it in Tertullian,
Cyprian, and other Fathers, remains involved in an obscurity that I cannot clear up.]

[Footnote 237: Cyprian never expelled any one from the Church, unless he had attacked the authority
of the bishops, and thus in the opinion of this Father placed himself outside her pale by his
own act.]

[Footnote 238: Hippol., Philos. IX. 12: [Greek: Kai parabolên tôn zizaniôn pros touto ephê
ho Kallistos legesthai. Aphete ta zizania sunauxein tô sitô, toutestin en tê ekklêsia tous
hamartanontas. Alla kai tên kibôton tou Nôe eis homoiôma ekklêsias ephê gegonenai, en hê kai
kunes kai lykoi kai korakes kai panta ta kathara kai akatharta; houtô phaskôn dein einai en
ekklêsia homoiôs, kai hosa pros touto dynatos ên synagein houtôs hêrmêneusen.] From Tertull.,
de idolol. 24, one cannot help assuming that even before the year 200 the laxer sort in Carthage
had already appealed to the Ark. ("Viderimus si secundum arcæ typum et corvus et milvus et
lupus et canis et serpens in ecclesia erit. Certe idololatres in arcæ typo non habetur. Quod
in arca non fuit, in ecclesia non sit"). But we do not know what form this took and what inferences
they drew. Moreover, we have here a very instructive example of the multitudinous difficulties
in which the Fathers were involved by typology: the Ark is the Church, hence the dogs and snakes
are men. To solve these problems it required an abnormal degree of acuteness and wit, especially
as each solution always started fresh questions. Orig. (Hom. II. in Genes. III.) also viewed
the Ark as the type of the Church (the working out of the image in Hom. I. in Ezech., Lomm.
XIV. p. 24 sq., is instructive); but apparently in the wild animals he rather sees the simple
Christians who are not yet sufficiently trained--at any rate he does not refer to the whoremongers
and adulterers who must be tolerated in the Church. The Roman bishop Stephen again, positively
insisted on Calixtus' conception of the Church, whereas Cornelius followed Cyprian (see Euseb.,
H. E. VI. 43. 10), who never declared sinners to be a necessary part of the Church in the same
fashion as Calixtus did. (See the following note and Cyp., epp. 67. 6; 68. 5).]

[Footnote 239: Philos., l.c.: [Greek: Kallistos edogmatisen hopôs ei episkopos hamartoi ti,
ei kai pros thanaton, mê dein katatithesthai]. That Hippolytus is not exaggerating here is
evident from Cyp., epp. 67, 68; for these passages make it very probable that Stephen also
assumed the irremovability of a bishop on account of gross sins or other failings.]

[Footnote 240: See Cypr., epp. 65, 66, 68; also 55. 11.]

[Footnote 241: This is asserted by Cyprian in epp. 65. 4 and 67. 3; but he even goes on to
declare that everyone is polluted that has fellowship with an impure priest, and takes part
in the offering celebrated by him.]

[Footnote 242: On this point the greatest uncertainty prevails in Cyprian. Sometimes he says
that God himself installs the bishops, and it is therefore a deadly sin against God to criticise
them (e.g., in ep. 66. 1); on other occasions he remembers that the bishops have been ordained
by bishops; and again, as in ep. 67. 3, 4, he appears to acknowledge the community's right
to choose and control them. Cf. the sections referring to Cyprian in Reuter's "Augustinische
Studien" (Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte, Vol. VII., p. 199 ff.).]

[Footnote 243: The Donatists were quite justified in appealing to Cyprian, that is, in one
of his two aspects.]

[Footnote 244: Origen not only distinguishes between different groups within the Church as
judged by their spiritual understanding and moral development (Comm. in Matt. Tom. XI. at Chap.
XV. 29; Hom. II. in Genes. Chap. 3; Hom. in Cantic. Tom. I. at Chap. I. 4: "ecclesia una quidem
est, cum perfecta est; multæ vero sunt adolescentulæ, cum adhuc instruuntur et proficiunt";
Hom. III. in Levit. Chap. iii.), but also between spiritual and carnal members (Hom. XXVI.
in Num. Chap. vii.) i.e., between true Christians and those who only bear that name without
heartfelt faith--who outwardly take part in everything, but bring forth fruits neither in belief
nor conduct. Such Christians he as little views as belonging to the Church as does Clement
of Alexandria (see Strom. VII. 14. 87, 88). To him they are like the Jebusites who were left
in Jerusalem: they have no part in the promises of Christ, but are lost (Comm. in Matt. T.
XII. c. xii.). It is the Church's task to remove such members, whence we see that Origen was
far from sharing Calixtus' view of the Church as a corpus permixtum; but to carry out this
process so perfectly that only the holy and the saved remain is a work beyond the powers of
human sagacity. One must therefore content oneself with expelling notorious sinners; see Hom.
XXI. in Jos., c. i.: "sunt qui ignobilem et degenerem vitam ducunt, qui et fide et actibus
et omni conversatione sua perversi sunt. Neque enim possibile est, ad liquidum purgari ecclesiam,
dum in terris est, ita ut neque impius in ea quisquam, neque peccator residere videatur, sed
sint in ea omnes sancti et beati, et in quibus nulla prorsus peccati macula deprehendatur.
Sed sicut dicitur de zizaniis: Ne forte eradicantes zizania simul eradicetis et triticum, ita
etiam super iis dici potest, in quibus vel dubia vel occulta peccata sunt.... Eos saltem eiiciamus
quos possumus, quorum peccata manifesta sunt. Ubi enim peccatum non est evidens, eiicere de
ecclesia neminem possumus." In this way indeed very many wicked people remain in the Church
(Comm. in Matt. T. X. at c. xiii. 47 f.: [Greek: mê xenizometha, ean horômen hêmôn ta athroismata
peplêrômena kai ponêrôn]); but in his work against Celsus Origen already propounded that empiric
and relative theory of the Christian Churches which views them as simply "better" than the
societies and civic communities existing alongside of them. The 29th and 30th chapters of the
3rd book against Celsus, in which he compares the Christians with the other population of Athens,
Corinth, and Alexandria, and the heads of congregations with the councillors and mayors of
these cities, are exceedingly instructive and attest the revolution of the times. In conclusion,
however, we must point out that Origen expressly asserts that a person unjustly excommunicated
remains a member of the Church in God's eyes; see Hom. XIV. in Levit. c. iii.: "ita fit, ut
interdum ille qui foras mittitur intussit, et ille foris, qui intus videtur retineri." Döllinger
(Hippolytus and Calixtus, page 254 ff.) has correctly concluded that Origen followed the disputes
between Hippolytus and Calixtus in Rome, and took the side of the former. Origen's trenchant
remarks about the pride and arrogance of the bishops of large towns (in Matth. XI. 9. 15; XII.
9-14; XVI. 8. 22 and elsewhere, e.g., de orat. 28, Hom. VI. in Isai c. i., in Joh. X. 16),
and his denunciation of such of them as, in order to glorify God, assume a mere distinction
of names between Father and Son, are also correctly regarded by Langen as specially referring
to the Roman ecclesiastics (Geschichte der römischen Kirche I. p. 242). Thus Calixtus was opposed
by the three greatest theologians of the age--Tertullian, Hippolytus, and Origen.]

[Footnote 245: If, in assuming the irremovability of a bishop even in case of mortal sin, the
Roman bishops went beyond Cyprian, Cyprian drew from his conception of the Church a conclusion
which the former rejected, viz., the invalidity of baptism administered by non-Catholics. Here,
in all likelihood, the Roman bishops were only determined by their interest in smoothing the
way to a return or admission to the Church in the case of non-Catholics. In this instance they
were again induced to adhere to their old practice from a consideration of the catholicity
of the Church. It redounds to Cyprian's credit that he drew and firmly maintained the undeniable
inferences from his own theory in spite of tradition. The matter never led to a great dogmatic
controversy.]

[Footnote 246: As to the events during the vacancy in the Roman see immediately before Novatian's
schism, and the part then played by the latter, who was still a member of the Church, see my
essay: "Die Briefe des römischen Klerus aus der Zeit. der Sedisvacanz im Jahre 250" (Abhandl.
f. Weizsäcker, 1892).]

[Footnote 247: So far as we are able to judge, Novatian himself did not extend the severer
treatment to all gross sinners (see ep. 55. 26, 27); but only decreed it in the case of the
lapsed. It is, however, very probable that in the later Novatian Churches no mortal sinner
was absolved (see, e.g., Socrates, H. E. I. 10). The statement of Ambrosius (de pænit. III.
3) that Novatian made no difference between gross and lesser sins and equally refused forgiveness
to transgressors of every kind distorts the truth as much as did the old reproach laid to his
charge, viz., that he as "a Stoic" made no distinction between sins. Moreover, in excluding
gross sinners, Novatian's followers did not mean to abandon them, but to leave them under the
discipline and intercession of the Church.]

[Footnote 248: The title of the evangelical life (evangelical perfection, imitation of Christ)
in contrast to that of ordinary Catholic Christians, a designation which we first find among
the Encratites (see Vol. I. p. 237, note 3) and Marcionites (see Tertull., adv. Marc. IV. 14:
"Venio nunc ad ordinarias sententias Marcionis, per quas proprietatem doctrinæ suæ inducit
ad edictum, ut ita dixerim, Christi, Beati mendici etc."), and then in Tertullian (in his pre-Montanist
period, see ad mart., de patient., de pænit., de idolol.; in his later career, see de coron.
8, 9, 13, 14; de fuga 8, 13; de ieiun. 6, 8, 15; de monog. 3, 5, 11; see Aubé, Les Chrétiens
dans l'empire Romain de la fin des Antonins, 1881, p. 237 ff.: "Chrétiens intransigeants et
Chrétiens opportunistes") was expressly claimed by Novatian (Cypr., ep. 44. 3: "si Novatiani
se adsertores evangelii et Christi esse confitentur"; 46. 2: "nec putetis, sic vos evangelium
Christi adserere"). Cornelius in Eusebius, H. E. VI. 43. II calls Novatian: [Greek: ho ekdikêtês
tou euangeliou]. This is exceedingly instructive, and all the more so when we note that, even
as far back as the end of the second century, it was not the "evangelical," but the lax, who
declared the claims of the Gospel to be satisfied if they kept God in their hearts, but otherwise
lived in entire conformity with the world. See Tertullian, de spec. 1; de pænit. 5: "Sed aiunt
quidam, satis deum habere, si corde et animo suspiciatur, licet actu minus fiat; itaque se
salvo metu et fide peccare, hoc est salva castitate matrimonia violare etc.": de ieiun. 2:
"Et scimus, quales sint carnalium commodorum suasoriæ, quam facile dicatur: Opus est de totis
præcordiis credam, diligam deum et proximum tanquam me. In his enim duobus præceptis tota lex
pendet et prophetæ, non in pulmonum et intestinorum meorum inanitate." The Valentinian Heracleon
was similarly understood, see above Vol. I. p. 262.]

[Footnote 249: Tertullian (de pud. 22) had already protested vigorously against such injustice.]

[Footnote 250: From Socrates' Ecclesiastical History we can form a good idea of the state of
the Novatian communities in Constantinople and Asia Minor. On the later history of the Catharist
Church see my article "Novatian," l.c., 667 ff. The most remarkable feature of this history
is the amalgamation of Novatian's adherents in Asia Minor with the Montanists and the absence
of distinction between their manner of life and that of the Catholics. In the 4th century of
course the Novatians were nevertheless very bitterly attacked.]

[Footnote 251: This indeed was disputed by Hippolytus and Origen.]

[Footnote 252: This last conclusion was come to after painful scruples, particularly in the
East--as we may learn from the 6th and 7th books of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History. For a
time the majority of the Oriental bishops adopted an attitude favourable to Novatian and unfavourable
to Cornelius and Cyprian. Then they espoused the cause of the latter, though without adopting
the milder discipline in all cases (see the canons of Ancyra and Neocæsarea IV. sæc. init.).
Throughout the East the whole question became involved in confusion, and was not decided in
accordance with clear principles. In giving up the last remnant of her exclusiveness (the canons
of Elvira are still very strict while those of Arles are lax), the Church became "Catholic"
in quite a special sense, in other words, she became a community where everyone could find
his place, provided he submitted to certain regulations and rules. Then, and not till then,
was the Church's pre-eminent importance for society and the state assured. It was no longer
variance, and no longer the sword (Matt. X. 34, 35), but peace and safety that she brought;
she was now capable of becoming an educative or, since there was little more to educate in
the older society, a conservative power. At an earlier date the Apologists (Justin, Melito,
Tertullian himself) had already extolled her as such, but it was not till now that she really
possessed this capacity. Among Christians, first the Encratites and Marcionites, next the adherents
of the new prophecy, and lastly the Novatians had by turns opposed the naturalisation of their
religion in the world and the transformation of the Church into a political commonwealth. Their
demands had progressively become less exacting, whence also their internal vigour had grown
ever weaker. But, in view of the continuous secularising of Christendom, the Montanist demands
at the beginning of the 3rd century already denoted no less than those of the Encratites about
the middle of the second, and no more than those of the Novatians about the middle of the third.
The Church resolutely declared war on all these attempts to elevate evangelical perfection
to an inflexible law for all, and overthrew her opponents. She pressed on in her world-wide
mission and appeased her conscience by allowing a twofold morality within her bounds. Thus
she created the conditions which enabled the ideal of evangelical perfection to be realised
in her own midst, in the form of monasticism, without threatening her existence. "What is monasticism
but an ecclesiastical institution that makes it possible to separate oneself from the world
and to remain in the Church, to separate oneself from the outward Church without renouncing
her, to set oneself apart for purposes of sanctification and yet to claim the highest rank
among her members, to form a brotherhood and yet to further the interests of the Church?" In
succeeding times great Church movements, such as the Montanist and Novatian, only succeeded
in attaining local or provincial importance. See the movement at Rome at the beginning of the
4th century, of which we unfortunately know so little (Lipsius, Chronologie der römischen Bischofe,
pp. 250-255), the Donatist Revolution, and the Audiani in the East.]

[Footnote 253: It is a characteristic circumstance that Tertullian's de ieiun. does not assume
that the great mass of Christians possess an actual knowledge of the Bible.]

[Footnote 254: The condition of the constitution of the Church about the middle of the 3rd
century (in accordance with Cyprian's epistles) is described by Otto Ritschl, l.c., pp. 142-237.
Parallels to the provincial and communal constitution of secular society are to be found throughout.]

[Footnote 255: To how great an extent the Church in Decius' time was already a state within
the state is shown by a piece of information given in Cyprian's 55th epistle (c. 9.): "Cornelius
sedit intrepidus Romæ in sacerdotali cathedra eo tempore: cum tyrannus infestus sacerdotibus
dei fanda adque infanda comminaretur, cum multo patientius et tolerabilius audiret levari adversus
se æmulum principem quam constitui Romæ dei sacerdotem." On the other hand the legislation
with regard to Christian flamens adopted by the Council of Elvira, which, as Duchesne (Mélanges
Renier: Le Concile d'Elvire et les flamines chrétiens, 1886) has demonstrated, most probably
dates from before the Diocletian persecution of 300, shows how closely the discipline of the
Church had already been adapted to the heathen regulations in the Empire. In addition to this
there was no lack of syncretist systems within Christianity as early as the 3rd century (see
the [Greek: Kestoi] of Julius Africanus, and other examples). Much information on this point
is to be derived from Origen's works and also, in many respects, from the attitude of this
author himself. We may also refer to relic- and hero-worship, the foundation of which was already
laid in the 3rd century, though the "religion of the second order" did not become a recognised
power in the Church or force itself into the official religion till the 4th.]

[Footnote 256: See Tertullian's frightful accusations in de pudic. (10) and de ieiun. (fin)
against the "Psychici", i.e., the Catholic Christians. He says that with them the saying had
really come to signify "peccando promeremur," by which, however, he does not mean the Augustinian:
"o felix culpa."]

[Footnote 257: The relation of this Church to theology, what theology she required and what
she rejected, and, moreover, to what extent she rejected the kind that she accepted may be
seen by reference to chap. 5 ff. We may here also direct attention to the peculiar position
of Origen in the Church as well as to that of Lucian the Martyr, concerning whom Alexander
of Alexandria (Theoderet, H. E. I. 3) remarks that he was a [Greek: aposunagôgos] in Antioch
for a long time, namely, during the rule of three successive bishops.]

[Footnote 258: We have already referred to the passage above. On account of its importance
we may quote it here:

"According to Celsus Apollo required the Metapontines to regard Aristeas as a god; but in their
eyes the latter was but a man and perhaps not a virtuous one ... They would therefore not obey
Apollo, and thus it happened that no one believed in the divinity of Aristeas. But with regard
to Jesus we may say that it proved a blessing to the human race to acknowledge him as the Son
of God, as God who appeared on earth united with body and soul." Origen then says that the
demons counterworked this belief, and continues: "But God who had sent Jesus on earth brought
to nought all the snares and plots of the demons and aided in the victory of the Gospel of
Jesus throughout the whole earth in order to promote the conversion and amelioration of men;
and everywhere brought about the establishment of Churches which are ruled by other laws than
those that regulate the Churches of the superstitious, the dissolute and the unbelieving. For
of such people the civil population ([Greek: politeuomena en tais ekklêsiais tôn poleôn plêthê])
of the towns almost everywhere consists." [Greek: Hai de tou Theou Christô mathêteuthesai ekklêsiai,

[Footnote 260: Clement of Rome was the first to compare the conductors of public worship in
Christian Churches with the priests and Levites, and the author of the [Greek: Didachê] was
the first to liken the Christian prophets to the high priests. It cannot, however, be shown
that there were any Christian circles where the leaders were directly styled "priests" before
the last quarter of the 2nd century. We can by no means fall back on Ignatius, Philad. 9, nor
on Iren., IV. 8. 3, which passage is rather to be compared with [Greek: Did.] 13. 3. It is
again different in Gnostic circles, which in this case, too, anticipated the secularising process:
read for example the description of Marcus in Iren., I. 13. Here, mutatis mutandis, we have
the later Catholic bishop, who alone is able to perform a mysterious sacrifice to whose person
powers of grace are attached--the formula of bestowal was: [Greek: metadounai soi thelô tês
emês charitos ... lambane ap' emou kai di' emou charin], and through whose instrumentality
union with God can alone be attained: the [Greek: apolutrôsis] (I. 21.) is only conferred through
the mystagogue. Much of a similar nature is to be found, and we can expressly say that the
distinction between priestly mystagogues and laymen was of fundamental importance in many Gnostic
societies (see also the writings of the Coptic Gnostics); it was different in the Marcionite
Church. Tertullian (de bapt. 17) was the first to call the bishop "summus sacerdos," and the
older opinion that he merely "played" with the idea is untenable, and refuted by Pseudo-Cyprian,
de aleat. 2 ("sacerdotalis dignitas"). In his Antimontanist writings the former has repeatedly
repudiated any distinction in principle of a particular priestly class among Christians, as
well as the application of certain injunctions to this order (de exhort. 7: "nonne et laici
sacerdotes sumus? 7). We may perhaps infer from his works that before about the year 200, the
name "priest" was not yet universally applied to bishop and presbyters in Carthage (but see
after this de præscr. 29, 41: sacerdotalia munera; de pud. 1, 21; de monog. 12: disciplina
sacerd.; de exhort. 7: sacerdotalis ordo, ibid. 11 "et offeres pro duabus uxoribus, et commendabis
illas duas per sacerdotem de monogamia ordinatum;" de virg. vel. 9: sacerdotale officium; Scorp.
7: sacerdos). The latest writings of Tertullian show us indeed that the name and the conception
which it represents were already prevalent. This he indeed did with reserve (see many passages,
e.g., Hom. II. in Num., Vol. II. p. 278; Hom. VI. in Lev., Vol. II. p. 211; Comment, in Joh.,
Vol. I. 3), but yet to a far greater extent than Clement (see Bigg, l.c., p. 214 f.). In Cyprian
and the literature of the Greek Church in the immediately following period we find the designation
"priest" as the regular and most customary name for the bishop and presbyters. Novatian (Jerome,
de vir. inl. 70) wrote a treatise de sacerdote and another de ordinatione. The notable and
momentous change of conception expressed in the idea can be traced by us through its preparatory
stages almost as little as the theory of the apostolic succession of the bishops. Irenæus (IV.
8. 3, 17. 5, 18. 1) and Tertullian, when compared with Cyprian, appear here as representatives
of primitive Christianity. They firmly assert the priesthood of the whole congregation. That
the laity had as great a share as the leaders of the Churches in the transformation of the
latter into Priests is moreover shown by the bitter saying of Tertullian (de monog. 12): "Sed
cum extollimur et inflamur adversus clerum, tunc unum omnes sumus, tunc omnes sacerdotes, quia
'sacerdotes nos deo et patri fecit'. Cum ad peræquationem disciplinæ sacerdotalis provocamur,
deponimus infulas."]

[Footnote 261: See Sohm, I. p. 207.]

[Footnote 262: The "deservire altari et sacrificia divina celebrare" (Cypr. ep. 67. 1) is the
distinctive function of the sacerdos dei. It may further be said, however, that all ceremonies
of public worship properly belong to him, and Cyprian has moreover contrived to show that this
function of the bishop as leader of the Church follows from his priestly attributes; for as
priest the bishop is antistes Christi (dei); see epp. 59. 18: 61. 2: 63. 14: 66. 5, and this
is the basis of his right and duty to preserve the lex evangelica and the traditio dominica
in every respect. As antistes dei however, an attribute bestowed on the bishop by the apostolic
succession and the laying on of hands, he has also received the power of the keys, which confers
the right to judge in Christ's stead and to grant or refuse the divine grace. In Cyprian's
conception of the episcopal office the successio apostolica and the position of vicegerent
of Christ (of God) counterbalance each other; he also tried to amalgamate both elements (ep.
55. 8: "cathedra sacerdotalis"). It is evident that as far as the inner life of each church
was concerned, the latter and newer necessarily proved the more important feature. In the East,
where the thought of the apostolical succession of the bishops never received such pronounced
expression as in Rome it was just this latter element that was almost exclusively emphasised
from the end of the 3rd century. Ignatius led the way when he compared the bishop, in his position
towards the individual community, with God and Christ. He, however, is dealing in images, but
at a later period the question is about realities based on a mysterious transference.]

[Footnote 263: Soon after the creation of a professional priesthood, there also arose a class
of inferior clergy. This was first the case in Rome. This development was not uninfluenced
by the heathen priesthood, and the temple service (see my article in Texte und Untersuchungen
II. 5). Yet Sohm, l.c., p. 128 ff., has disputed this, and proposed modifications, worth considering,
in my view of the origin of the ordines minores.]

[Footnote 264: Along with the sacerdotal laws, strictly so called, which Cyprian already understood
to apply in a frightful manner (see his appeal to Deut. XVII. 12; 1 Sam. VIII. 7; Luke X. 16;
John XVIII. 22 f.; Acts XXIII. 4-5 in epp. 3. 43, 59. 66), other Old Testament commandments
could not fail to be introduced. Thus the commandment of tithes, which Irenæus had still asserted
to be abolished, was now for the first time established (see Origen; Constit. Apost. and my
remarks on [Greek: Did]. c. 13); and hence Mosaic regulations as to ceremonial cleanness were
adopted (see Hippol. Canones arab. 17; Dionys. Alex., ep. canon.). Constantine was the first
to base the observance of Sunday on the commandment as to the Sabbath. Besides, the West was
always more hesitating in this respect than the East. In Cyprian's time, however, the classification
and dignity of the clergy were everywhere upheld by an appeal to Old Testament commandments,
though reservations still continued to be made here and there.]

[Footnote 265: Tertullian (de pud. I) sneeringly named the bishop of Rome "pontifex maximus,"
thereby proving that he clearly recognised the heathen colouring given to the episcopal office.
With the picture of the bishop drawn by the Apostolic constitutions may be compared the ill-natured
descriptions of Paul of Samosata in Euseb., VII. 30.]

[Footnote 266: Yet this influence, in a direct form at least, can only be made out at a comparatively
late period. But nevertheless, from the middle of the 3rd century the priests alone are possessed
of knowledge. As [Greek: mathêsis] and [Greek: mystagôgia] are inseparably connected in the
mysteries and Gnostic societies, and the mystagogue was at once knowing one and priest, so
also in the Catholic Church the priest is accounted the knowing one. Doctrine itself became
a mystery to an increasing extent.]

[Footnote 267: Examples are found in epp. 1, 3, 4, 33, 43, 54, 57, 59, 65, 66. But see Iren.,
IV. 26. 2, who is little behind Cyprian here, especially when he threatens offenders with the
fate of Dathan and Abiram. One of the immediate results of the formation of a priestly and
spiritual class was that the independent "teachers" now shared the fate of the old "prophets"
and became extinct (see my edition of the [Greek: Didachê], prolegg. pp. 131-137). It is an
instructive fact that Theoktistus of Cæsarea and Alexander of Jerusalem in order to prove in
opposition to Demetrius that independent teachers were still tolerated, i.e., allowed to speak
in public meetings of the Church, could only appeal to the practice of Phrygia and Lycaonia,
that is, to the habit of outlying provinces where, besides, Montanism had its original seat.
Euelpis in Laranda, Paulinus in Iconium, and Theodorus in Synnada, who flourished about 216,
are in addition to Origen the last independent teachers (i.e., outside the ranks of the clergy)
known to us in Christendom (Euseb., H. E. VI. 19 fin.).]

of the "sacerdotium" or that of the "sacrificium" was first altered, because they are correlative
ideas.]

[Footnote 269: See the proof passages in Höfling, l.c., who has also treated in detail Clement
and Origen's idea of sacrifice, and cf. the beautiful saying of Irenæus IV. 18. 3: "Non sacrificia
sanctificant hominem; non enim indiget sacrificio deus; sed conscientia eius qui offert sanctificat
sacrificium, pura exsistens, et præstat acceptare deum quasi ab amico" (on the offering in
the Lord's Supper see Iren. IV. 17. 5, 18. 1); Tertull., Apolog. 30; de orat. 28; adv. Marc.
III. 22; IV. 1, 35: adv. Jud. 5; de virg. vel. 13.]

[Footnote 270: Cf. specially the Montanist writings; the treatise de ieiunio is the most important
among them in this case; see cc. 7, 16; de resurr. 8. On the use of the word "satisfacere"
and the new ideas on the point which arose in the West (cf. also the word "meritum") see below
chap. 5. 2 and the 2nd chap. of the 5th Vol. Note that the 2nd Ep. of Clement already contains
the sayings: [Greek: kalon eleêmounê hôs metanoia hamartias kreissôn nêsteia proseuchês, eleêmosunê
de amphoterôn ... eleêmosunê gar kouphisma hamartias ginetai] (16. 4; similar expressions occur
in the "Shepherd"). But they only show how far back we find the origin of these injunctions
borrowed from Jewish proverbial wisdom. One cannot say that they had no effect at all on Christian
life in the 2nd century; but we do not yet find the idea that ascetic performances are a sacrifice
offered to a wrathful God. Martyrdom seems to have been earliest viewed as a performance which
expiated sins. In Tertullian's time the theory, that it was on a level with baptism (see Melito,
12. Fragment in Otto, Corp. Apol. IX. p. 418: [Greek: duo sunestê ta aphesin amartêmata parechomena,
pathos dia Christon kai baptisma]), had long been universally diffused and was also exegetically
grounded. In fact, men went a step further and asserted that the merits of martyrs could also
benefit others. This view had likewise become established long before Tertullian's day, but
was opposed by him (de pudic 22), when martyrs abused the powers universally conceded to them.
Origen went furthest here; see exhort. ad mart. 50: [Greek: hôsper timiô haimati tou Iêsou
êgorasthêmen ... houtôs tô timiô haimati tôn marturôn agorasthêsontai tines]; Hom. X. in Num.
c. II.: "ne forte, ex quo martyres non fiunt et hostiæ sanctorum non offeruntur pro peccatis
nostris, peccatorum nostrorum remissionem non mereamur." The origin of this thought is, on
the one hand, to be sought for in the wide-spread notion that the sufferings of an innocent
man benefit others, and, on the other, in the belief that Christ himself suffered in the martyrs
(see, e.g., ep. Lugd. in Euseb., H. E. V. 1. 23, 41).]

[Footnote 271: In the East it was Origen who introduced into Christianity the rich treasure
of ancient ideas that had become associated with sacrifices. See Bigg's beautiful account in
"The Christian Platonists of Alexandria," Lect. IV.-VI.]

[Footnote 272: Moreover, Tertullian (Scorp. 6) had already said: "Quomodo multæ mansiones apud
patrem, si non pro varietate meritorum."]

[Footnote 273: See c. 1: "Nam cum dominus adveniens sanasset illa, quæ Adam portaverit vulnera
et venena serpentis antiqua curasset, legem dedit sano et præcepit, ne ultra iam peccaret,
ne quid peccanti gravius eveniret: coartati eramus et in augustum innocentiæ præscriptione
conclusi, nec haberet quid fragilitatis humanæ infirmitas adque imbecillitas faceret, nisi
iterum pietas divina subveniens iustitiæ et misericordiæ operibus ostensis viam quandam tuendæ
salutis aperiret, ut sordes postmodum quascumque contrahimus eleemosynis abluamus." c. 2: "sicut
lavacro aquæ salutaris gehennæ ignis extinguitur, ita eleemosynis adque operationibus iustus
delictorum flamma sopitur, et quia semel in baptismo remissa peccatorum datur, adsidua et iugis
operatic baptismi instar imitata dei rursus indulgentiam largiatur." 5, 6, 9. In c. 18 Cyprian
already established an arithmetical relation between the number of alms-offerings and the blotting
out of sins, and in c. 21, in accordance with an ancient idea which Tertullian and Minucius
Felix, however, only applied to martyrdom, he describes the giving of alms as a spectacle for
God and Christ. In Cyprian's epistles "satisfacere deo" is exceedingly frequent. It is almost
still more important to note the frequent use of the expression "promereri deum (iudicem)"
in Cyprian. See de unitate 15: "iustitia opus est, ut promereri quis possit deum iudicem: præceptis
eius et monitis obtemperandum est, ut accipiant merita nostra mercedem." 18; de lapsis 31;
de orat. 8, 32, 36; de mortal. 10; de op. 11, 14, 15, 26; de bono pat. 18; ep. 62. 2: 73. 10.
Here it is everywhere assumed that Christians acquire God's favour by their works.]

[Footnote 274: Baptism with blood is not referred to here.]

[Footnote 275: With modifications, this has still continued to be the case beyond Augustine's
time down to the Catholicism of the present day. Cyprian is the father of the Romish doctrine
of good works and sacrifice. Yet is it remarkable that he was not yet familiar with the theory
according to which man must acquire merita. In his mind "merits" and "blessedness" are not
yet rigidly correlated ideas; but the rudiments of this view are also found in him; cf. de
unit. 15 (see p. 134, note 3).]

[Footnote 276: "Sacrificare," "sacrificium celebrare," in all passages where they are unaccompanied
by any qualifying words, mean to celebrate the Lord's Supper. Cyprian has never called prayer
a "sacrifice" without qualifying terms; on the contrary he collocates "preces" and "sacrificium,"
and sometimes also "oblatio" and "sacrificium." The former is then the offering of the laity
and the latter of the priests.]

[Footnote 277: Cf. the whole 63rd epistle and above all c. 7: "Et quia passionis eius mentionem
in sacrificiis omnibus facimus, passio est enim domini sacrificium quod offerrimus, nihil aliud
quam quod ille fecit facere debemus;" c. 9.: "unde apparet sanguinem Christi non offerri, si
desit vinum calici." 13; de unit. 17: "dominicæ hostiæ veritatem per falsa sacrificia profanare;"
ep. 63. 4: "sacramentum sacrificii dominici." The transference of the sacrificial idea to the
consecrated elements, which, in all probability, Cyprian already found in existence, is ultimately
based on the effort to include the element of mystery and magic in the specifically sacerdotal
ceremony of sacrifice, and to make the Christian offering assume, though not visibly, the form
of a bloody sacrifice, such as secularised Christianity desired. This transference, however,
was the result of two causes. The first has been already rightly stated by Ernesti (Antimur.
p. 94) in the words: "quia eucharistia habet [Greek: anamnêsin] Christi mortui et sacrificii
eius in cruce peracti, propter ea paullatim coepta est tota eucharistia sacrificium dici."
In Cyprian's 63rd epistle it is still observable how the "calicem in commemorationem domini
et passionis eius offerre" passes over into the "sanguinem Christi offerre," see also Euseb.
demonstr. I. 13: [Greek: mnêmên tês thysias Christou prospherein] and [Greek: tên ensarkon
tou Christou parousian kai to katartisthen autou sôma prospherein]. The other cause has been
specially pointed out by Theodore Harnack (l.c., p. 409 f.). In ep. 63. 2 and in many other
passages Cyprian expresses the thought "that in the Lord's Supper nothing else is done by us
but what the Lord has first done for us." But he says that at the institution of the Supper
the Lord first offered himself as a sacrifice to God the Father. Consequently the priest officiating
in Christ's stead only presents a true and perfect offering when he imitates what Christ has
done (c. 14: "si Christus Jesus dominus et deus noster ipse est summus sacerdos dei patris
et sacrificiam patri se ipsum obtulit et hoc fieri in sui commemorationem præcepit, utique
ille sacerdos vice Christi vere fungitur, qui id quod Christus fecit imitatur et sacrificium
verum et plenum tunc offert in ecclesia deo patri, si sic incipiat offerre secundum quod ipsum
Christum videat obtulisse"). This brings us to the conception of the repetition of Christ's
sacrifice by the priest. But in Cyprian's case it was still, so to speak, only a notion verging
on that idea, that is, he only leads up to it, abstains from formulating it with precision,
or drawing any further conclusions from it, and even threatens the idea itself inasmuch as
he still appears to conceive the "calicem in commemorationem domini et passionis eius offerre"
as identical with it. As far as the East is concerned we find in Origen no trace of the assumption
of a repeated sacrifice of Christ. But in the original of the first 6 books of the Apostolic
Constitutions this conception is also wanting, although the Supper ceremonial has assumed an
exclusively sacerdotal character (see II. 25: [Greek: hai tote] (in the old covenant) [Greek:
thusiai, nun euchai kai deêseis kai eucharistiai]. II. 53). The passage VI. 23: [Greek: anti
thusias tês di' haimatôn tên logikên kai anaimakton kai tên mustikên, hêtis eis ton thanaton
tou kuriou symbolôn charin epiteleitai tou sômatos autou kai tou haimatos] does not belong
to the original document, but to the interpolator. With the exception therefore of one passage
in the Apostolic Church order (printed in my edition of the Didache prolegg. p. 236) viz.:
[Greek: hê prosphora tou sômatos kai tou haimatos], we possess no proofs that there was any
mention in the East before Eusebius' time of a sacrifice of Christ's body in the Lord's Supper.
From this, however, we must by no means conclude that the mystic feature in the celebration
of the sacrifice had been less emphasised there.]

[Footnote 278: In ep. 63. 13 Cyprian has illustrated the incorporation of the community with
Christ by the mixture of wine and water in the Supper, because the special aim of the epistle
required this: "Videmus in aqua populum intellegi, in vino vero ostendi sanguinem Christi;
quando autem in calice vino aqua miscetur, Christo populus adunatur et credentium plebs ei
in quem credidit copulatur et iungitur etc." The special mention of the offerers (see already
Tertullian's works: de corona 3, de exhort. cast. II, and de monog. 10) therefore means that
the latter commend themselves to Christ as his own people, or are recommended to him as such.
On the Praxis see Cyprian ep. I. 2 "... si quis hoc fecisset. non offerretur pro eo nee sacrificium
pro dormitione eius celebraretur;" 62. 5: "ut fratres nostros in mente habeatis orationibus
vestris et eis vicem boni operis in sacrificiis et precibus repræsentetis, subdidi nomina singulorum."]

[Footnote 279: Much as the use of the word "sacramentum" in the Western Church from Tertullian
to Augustine (Hahn, Die Lehre von den Sacramenten, 1864, p. 5 ff.) differs from that in the
classic Romish use it is of small interest in the history of dogma to trace its various details.
In the old Latin Bible [Greek: mystêrion] was translated "sacramentum" and thus the new signification
"mysterious, holy ordinance or thing" was added to the meaning "oath," "sacred obligation."
Accordingly Tertullian already used the word to denote sacred facts, mysterious and salutary
signs and vehicles, and also holy acts. Everything in any way connected with the Deity and
his revelation, and therefore, for example, the content of revelation as doctrine, is designated
"sacrament;" and the word is also applied to the symbolical which is always something mysterious
and holy. Alongside of this the old meaning "sacred obligation" still remains in force. If,
because of this comprehensive use, further discussion of the word is unnecessary, the fact
that revelation itself as well as everything connected with it was expressly designated as
a "mystery" is nevertheless of importance in the history of dogma. This usage of the word is
indeed not removed from the original one so long as it was merely meant to denote the supernatural
origin and supernatural nature of the objects in question; but more than this was now intended;
"sacramentum" ([Greek: mystêrion]) was rather intended to represent the holy thing that was
revealed as something relatively concealed. This conception, however, is opposed to the Judæo-Christian
idea of revelation, and is thus to be regarded as an introduction of the Greek notion. Probst
(Sacramente und Sacramentalia, 1872) thinks differently. That which is mysterious and dark
appears to be such an essential attribute of the divine, that even the obscurities of the New
Testament Scriptures were now justified because these writings were regarded as altogether
"spiritual." See Iren. II. 28. 1-3. Tert. de bapt. 2: "deus in stultitia et impossibilitate
materias operationis suæ instituit."]

[Footnote 280: We have explained above that the Church already possessed this means of grace,
in so far as she had occasionally absolved mortal sinners, even at an earlier period; but this
possession was quite uncertain and, strictly speaking, was not a possession at all, for in
such cases the early Church merely followed extraordinary directions of the Spirit.]

[Footnote 281: Höfling, Das Sacrament der Taufe, 2 Vols., 1846. Steitz, Art. "Taufe" in Herzog's
Real-Encyklopädie. Walch, Hist. pædobaptismi quattuor priorum sæculorum, 1739.]

[Footnote 282: In de bono pudic. 2: "renati ex aqua et pudicitia," Pseudo-Cyprian expresses
an idea, which, though remarkable, is not confined to himself.]

[Footnote 283: But Tertullian says (de bapt. 6): "Non quod in aquis spiritum sanctum consequamur,
sed in aqua emundati sub angelo spiritui sancto præparamur."]

[Footnote 284: The disquisitions of Clement of Alexandria in Pædag. I, 6 (baptism and sonship)
are very important, but he did not follow them up. It is deserving of note that the positive
effects of baptism were more strongly emphasised in the East than in the West. But, on the
other hand, the conception is more uncertain in the former region.]

[Footnote 285: See Tertullian, de bapt. 7 ff.; Cypr., ep. 70. 2 ("ungi quoque necesse est eum
qui baptizatus est, ut accepto chrismate, i.e., unctione esse unctus dei et habere in se gratiam
Christi possit"), 74. 5 etc. "Chrism" is already found in Tertullian as well as the laying
on of hands. The Roman Catholic bishop Cornelius in the notorious epistle to Fabius (Euseb.,
H. E. VI. 43. 15), already traces the rites which accompany baptism to an ecclesiastical canon
(perhaps one from Hippolytus' collection: see can. arab. 19). After relating that Novatian
in his illness had only received clinical baptism he writes: [Greek: ou mên oude tôn loipôn
etuche, diaphugôn tên noson, hôn chrê metalambanein kata ton tês ekklêsias kanona, tou te sphragisthênai
hupo tou episkopou.] It is also remarkable that one of the bishops who voted about heretic
baptism (Sentent. episcop., Cypr., opp. ed. Hartel I. p. 439) calls the laying on of hands
a sacrament like baptism: "neque enim spiritus sine aqua separatim operari potest nec aqua
sine spiritu male ergo sibi quidem interpretantur ut dicant, quod per manus impositionem spiritum
sanctum accipiant et sic recipiantur, cum manifestum sit utroque sacramento debere eos renasci
in ecclesia catholica." Among other particulars found in Tertullian's work on baptism (cc.
I. 12 seq.) it may moreover be seen that there were Christians about the year 200, who questioned
the indispensability of baptism to salvation (baptismus non est necessarius, quibus fides satis
est). The assumption that martyrdom replaces baptism (Tertull., de bapt. 16; Origen), is in
itself a sufficient proof that the ideas of the "sacrament" were still uncertain. As to the
objection that Jesus himself had not baptised and that the Apostles had not received Christian
baptism see Tert., de bapt. 11, 12.]

[Footnote 286: In itself the performance of this rite seemed too simple to those who sought
eagerly for mysteries. See Tertull., de bapt. 2: "Nihil adeo est quod obduret mentes hominum
quam simplicitas divinorum operum, quæ in actu videtur, et magnificentia, quæ in effecta repromittitur,
ut hinc quoque, quoniam tanta simplicitate, sine pompa, sine apparatu novo aliquo, denique
sine sumptu homo in aqua demissus et inter pauca verba tinctus non multo vel nihilo mundior
resurgit, eo incredibilis existimetur consecutio æternitatis. Mentior, si non e contrario idolorum
solemnia vel arcana de suggestu et apparatu deque sumptu fidem at auctoritatem sibi exstruunt."]

[Footnote 287: But see Euseb., H. E. VI. 43. 15, who says that only the laying on of hands
on the part of the bishop communicates the Holy Spirit, and this ceremony must therefore follow
baptism. It is probable that confirmation as a specific act did not become detached from baptism
in the West till shortly before the middle of the third century. Perhaps we may assume that
the Mithras cult had an influence here.]

[Footnote 288: See Tertullian's superstitious remarks in de bap. 3-9 to the effect that water
is the element of the Holy Spirit and of unclean Spirits etc. Melito also makes a similar statement
in the fragment of his treatise on baptism in Pitra, Anal, Sacra II., p. 3 sq. Cyprian, ep.
70. I, uses the remarkable words: "oportet veio mundari et sanctificari aquam prius a sacer
dote (Tertull. still knows nothing of this: c. 17: etiam laicis ius est), ut possit baptismo
suo peccata hominis qui baptizatur abluere." Ep. 74. 5: "peccata purgare et hominem sanctificare
aqua sola non potest, nisi habeat et spiritum sanctum." Clem. Alex. Protrept. 10.99: [Greek:
labete hudôr logikos].]

[Footnote 289: It was easy for Origen to justify child baptism, as he recognised something
sinful in corporeal birth itself, and believed in sin which had been committed in a former
life. The earliest justification of child baptism may therefore be traced back to a philosophical
doctrine.]

[Footnote 290: Translator's note. The following is the original Latin, as quoted by Prof. Harnack:
"Cunctatio baptismi utilior est, præcipue circa parvulos. Quid enim necesse, sponsores etiam
periculo ingeri ... veniant ergo parvuli, dum adolescunt; veniant dum discunt, dum quo veniant
docentur; fiant Christiani, cum Christum nosse potuerint. Quid festinat innocens ætas ad remissionem
peccatorum? Cautius agetur in sæcularibus, ut cui substantia terrena non creditur, divina credatur
... Si qui pondus intelligant baptismi, magis timebunt consecutionem quam dilationem."]

[Footnote 291: Under such circumstances the recollection of the significance of baptism in
the establishment of the Church fell more and more into the background (see Hermas: "the Church
rests like the world upon water;" Irenæus III. 17. Corpora unim nostra per lavacrum illam quæ
est ad incorruptionem unitatem acceperunt, animæ autem per spiritum"). The unbaptised (catechumens)
also belong to the Church, when they commit themselves to her guidance and prayers. Accordingly
baptism ceased more and more to be regarded as an act of initiation, and only recovered this
character in the course of the succeeding centuries. In this connection the 7th (spurious)
canon of Constantinople (381) is instructive: [Greek: kai tên prôtên hêmeran poioumen autous
Christianous, tên de deuteran katêchoumenous, eita tên tritên exorkizomen autous k.t.l.]]

and love feast had already been separated from the middle of the 2nd century in the West, they
were still united in Alexandria in Clement's time; see Bigg, l.c., p. 103.]

[Footnote 293: The collocation of baptism and the Lord's Supper, which, as the early Christian
monuments prove, was a very familiar practice (Tert. adv. Marc. IV. 34: "sacramentum baptismi
et eucharistiæ;" Hippol., can. arab. 38: "baptizatus et corpore Christi pastus"), was, so far
as I know, justified by no Church Father on internal grounds. Considering their conception
of the holy ordinances this is not surprising. They were classed together because they were
instituted by the Lord, and because the elements (water, wine, bread) afforded much common
ground for allegorical interpretation.]

[Footnote 294: The story related by Dionysius (in Euseb., l.c.) is especially characteristic,
as the narrator was an extreme spiritualist. How did it stand therefore with the dry tree?
Besides, Tertull. (de corona 3) says: "Calicis aut panis nostri aliquid decuti in terram anxie
patimur". Superstitious reverence for the sacrament ante et extra usum is a very old habit
of mind in the Gentile Church.]

[Footnote 295: Leimbach's investigations of Tertullian's use of words have placed this beyond
doubt; see de orat. 6; adv. Marc. I. 14: IV. 40: III. 19; de resuri. 8.]

[Footnote 296: The chief passages referring to the Supper in Clement are Protrept. 12. 120;
Pæd. I. 6. 43: II. 2. 19 sq.: I. 5. 15: I. 6. 38, 40; Quis div. 23; Strom. V. 10. 66: I. 10.
46: I. 19. 96: VI. 14. 113: V. II. 70. Clement thinks as little of forgiveness of sins in connection
with the Supper as does the author of the Didache or the other Fathers; this feast is rather
meant to bestow an initiation into knowledge and immortality. Ignatius had already said, "the
body is faith, the blood is hope." This is also Clement's opinion; he also knows of a transubstantiation,
not, however, into the real body of Christ, but into heavenly powers. His teaching was therefore
that of Valentinus (see the Exc. ex. Theod. § 82, already given on Vol. i. p. 263) Strom. V.
11. 70: [Greek: logikon hêmin brôma hê gnôsis]; I. 20. 46: [Greek: hina dê phagômen logikôs];
V. 10. 66: [Greek: brôsis gar kai posis tou theiou logou hê gnôsis esti tês theias ousias].

Matt. XI. 14; c. Cels. VIII. 33. Hom. XVI. 9 in Num. On Origen's doctrine of the Lord's Supper
see Bigg, p. 219 ff.]

[Footnote 298: The conception of the Supper as viaticum mortis (fixed by the 13th canon of
Nicæa: [Greek: peri de tôn exodeuontôn ho palaios kai kanonikos nomos phulachthêsetai kai nun,
hôste eitis exodeuoi, tou teleutaiou kai anagkaiotatou ephodiou mê apostereisthai]), a conception
which is genuinely Hellenic and which was strengthened by the idea that the Supper was [Greek:
pharmakon athanasias], the practice of benediction, and much else in theory and practice connected
with the Eucharist reveal the influence of antiquity. See the relative articles in Smith and
Cheetham's Dictionary of Christian Antiquities.]

[Footnote 299: The fullest account of the "history of the Romish Church down to the pontificate
of Leo I." has been given by Langen, 1881; but I can in no respect agree (see Theol. Lit. Ztg.
1891, No. 6) with the hypotheses about the primacy as propounded by him in his treatise on
the Clementine romances (1890, see especially p. 163 ff). The collection of passages given
by Caspari, "Quellen zur Geschichte des Taufsymbols," Vol. III., deserves special recognition.
See also the sections bearing on this subject in Renan's "Origines du Christianisme," Vols.
V.-VII. especially VII., chaps. 5, 12, 23. Sohm in his "Kirchenrecht" I. (see especially pp.
164 ff., 350 ff., 377 ff.) has adopted my conception of "Catholic" and "Roman," and made it
the basis of further investigations. He estimates the importance of the Roman Church still
more highly, in so far as, according to him, she was the exclusive originator of Church law
as well as of the Catholic form of Church constitution; and on page 381 he flatly says: "The
whole Church constitution with its claim to be founded on divine arrangement was first developed
in Rome and then transferred from her to the other communities." I think this is an exaggeration.
Tschirn (Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte, XII. p. 215 ff.) has discussed the origin of the
Roman Church in the 2nd century. Much that was the common property of Christendom, or is found
in every religion as it becomes older, is regarded by this author as specifically Roman.]

[Footnote 300: No doubt we must distinguish two halves in Christendom. The first, the ecclesiastical
West, includes the west coast of Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome together with their daughter
Churches, that is, above all, Gaul and North Africa. The second or eastern portion embraces
Palestine, Egypt, Syria, and the east part of Asia Minor. A displacement gradually arose in
the course of the 3rd century. In the West the most important centres are Ephesus, Smyrna,
Corinth, and Rome, cities with a Greek and Oriental population. Even in Carthage the original
speech of the Christian community was probably Greek.]

[Footnote 301: Rome was the first city in the Empire, Alexandria the second. They were the
metropolitan cities of the world (see the inscription in Kaibel, No. 1561, p. 407: [Greek:
threpse m' Alexandreia, metoikon ethapse de Rhomê, hai kosmou kai gês, ô xene, mêtropoleis]).
This is reflected in the history of the Church; first Rome appears, then Alexandria. The significance
of the great towns for the history of dogma and of the Church will be treated of in a future
volume. Abercius of Hieropolis, according to the common interpretation (inscription V. 7 f.)
designates Rome as "queen." This was a customary appellation; see Eunap., vita Prohaer. p.
90: [Greek: hê basileuousa Rhômê].]

[Footnote 302: In this connection we need only keep in mind the following summary of facts.
Up to the end of the second century the Alexandrian Church had none of the Catholic and apostolic
standards, and none of the corresponding institutions as found in the Roman Church; but her
writer, Clement, was also "as little acquainted with the West as Homer." In the course of the
first half of the 3rd century she received those standards and institutions; but her writer,
Origen, also travelled to Rome himself in order to see "the very old" church and formed a connection
with Hippolytus; and her bishop Dionysius carried on a correspondence with his Roman colleague,
who also made common cause with him. Similar particulars may also be ascertained with regard
to the Syrian Church.]

[Footnote 303: See the proofs in the two preceding chapters. Note also that these elements
have an inward connection. So long as one was lacking, all were, and whenever one was present,
all the others immediately made their appearance.]

[Footnote 304: Ignatius already says that the Roman Christians are [Greek: apodiulismenoi apo
pantos allotrion chrômatos] (Rom. inscr.); he uses this expression of no others. Similar remarks
are not quite rare at a later period; see, for instance, the oft-repeated eulogy that no heresy
ever arose in Rome. At a time when this city had long employed the standard of the apostolic
rule of faith with complete confidence, namely, at the beginning of the 3rd century, we hear
that a lady of rank in Alexandria, who was at any rate a Christian, lodged and entertained
in her house Origen, then a young man, and a famous heretic. (See Euseb., H. E. VI. 2. 13,
14). The lectures on doctrine delivered by this heretic and the conventicles over which he
presided were attended by a [Greek: murion plêthos ou monon hairetikôn, alla kai hêmetephôn].
That is a very valuable piece of information which shows us a state of things in Alexandria
that would have been impossible in Rome at the same period. See, besides, Dionys. Alex, in
Euseb., H. E. VII. 7.]

[Footnote 305: I must here refrain from proving the last assertion. The possibility of Asia
Minor having had a considerable share, or having led the way, in the formation of the canon
must be left an open question (cf. what Melito says, and the use made of New Testament writings
in the Epistle of Polycarp). We will, however, be constrained to lay the chief emphasis on
Rome, for it must not be forgotten that Irenæus had the closest connection with the Church
of that city, as is proved by his great work, and that he lived there before he came to Gaul.
Moreover, it is a fact deserving of the greatest attention that the Montanists and their decided
opponents in Asia, the so-called Alogi, had no ecclesiastical canon before them, though they
may all have possessed the universally acknowledged books of the Romish canon, and none other,
in the shape of books read in the churches.]

[Footnote 306: See the Prolegg. of Westcott and Hort (these indeed give an opposite judgment),
and cf. Harris, Codex Bezae. A study of the so-called Western text of the New Testament 1891.
An exhaustive study of the oldest martyrologies has already led to important cases of agreement
between Rome and the East, and promises still further revelations. See Duchesne, "Les Sources
du Martyrologe Hieron." 1885. Egli, "Altchristliche Studien, Martyrien und Martyrologieen ältester
Zeit." I think I have there proved that, in the time of Soter, Rome already possessed a figured
list of bishops, in which important events were also entered.]

[Footnote 309: That the idea of the apostolic succession of the bishops was first turned to
account or appeared in Rome is all the more remarkable, because it was not in that city, but
rather in the East, that the monarchical episcopate was first consolidated. (Cf. the Shepherd
of Hermas and Ignatius' Epistles to the Romans with his other Epistles). There must therefore
have been a very rapid development of the constitution in the time between Hyginus and Victor.
Sohm, l.c., tries to show that the monarchical episcopate arose in Rome immediately after the
composition of the First Epistle of Clement, and as a result of it; and that this city was
the centre from which it spread throughout Christendom.]

[Footnote 310: See Pseudo-Cyprian's work "de aleat" which, in spite of remarks to the contrary,
I am inclined to regard as written by Victor; cf. "Texte und Untersuchungen" V. I; see c. I
of this writing: "et quoniam in nobis divina et paterna pietas apostolatus ducatum contulit
et vicariam domini sedem cælesti dignatione ordinavit et originem authentici apostolatus, super
quem Christus fundavit ecclesiam, in superiore nostro portamus."]

[Footnote 311: See report of the proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science, 1892,
p. 622 ff. To the material found there must be added a remarkable passage given by Nestle (Zeitschrift
fur wissenschaftliche Theologie, 1893, p. 437), where the dates are reckoned after Sixtus I.]

[Footnote 312: Cf. the 8th book of the Apostolic Constitutions with the articles referring
to the regulation of the Church, which in Greek MSS. bear the name of Hippolytus. Compare also
the Arabian Canones Hippolyti, edited by Haneberg (1870) and commented on by Achelis (Texte
und Untersuchungen VI. 4). Apart from the additions and alterations, which are no doubt very
extensive, it is hardly likely that the name of the Roman bishop is wrongly assigned to them.
We must further remember the importance assigned by the tradition of the Eastern and Western
Churches to one of the earliest Roman "bishops," Clement, as the confidant and secretary of
the Apostles and as the composer and arranger of their laws.]

[Footnote 313: See my proofs in "Texte und Untersuchungen," Vol. II., Part 5. The canons of
the Council of Nicæa presuppose the distinction of higher and lower clergy for the whole Church.]

[Footnote 314: We see this from the Easter controversy, but there are proofs of it elsewhere,
e.g., in the collection of Cyprian's epistles. The Roman bishop Cornelius informs Fabius, bishop
of Antioch, of the resolutions of the Italian, African, and other Churches (Euseb., H. E. VI.
43. 3: [Greek: êlthon eis hêmas epistolai Kornêliou Rhômaiôn episkopou pros ... phabion, dêlousai
ta peri tês Rhômaiôn sunodou, kai ta doxanta pasi tois kata tên Italian kai Aphrikên kai tas
autophi chôras]). We must not forget, however, that there were also bishops elsewhere who conducted
a so-called oecumenical correspondence and enjoyed great influence, as, e.g., Dionysius of
Corinth and Dionysius of Alexandria. In matters relating to penance the latter wrote to a great
many Churches, even as far as Armenia, and sent many letters to Rome (Euseb., H. E. VI. 46).
The Catholic theologian, Dittrich--before the Vatican Decree, no doubt--has spoken of him in
the following terms (Dionysius von Alexandrien, 1867, p. 26): "As Dionysius participated in
the power, so also he shared in the task of the primateship." "Along with the Roman bishop
he was, above all, called upon to guard the interests of the whole Church."]

[Footnote 315: This conception, as well as the ideas contained in this Excursus generally,
is now entirely shared by Weingarten (Zeittafeln, 3rd. ed., 1888, pp. 12, 21): "The Catholic
Church is essentially the work of those of Rome and Asia Minor. The Alexandrian Church and
theology do not completely adapt themselves to it till the 3rd century. The metropolitan community
becomes the ideal centre of the Great Church" ... "The primacy of the Roman Church is essentially
the transference to her of Rome's central position in the religion of the heathen world during
the Empire: urbs æterna urbs sacra."]

[Footnote 316: This is also admitted by Langen (l.c., 184 f.), who even declares that this
precedence existed from the beginning.]

[Footnote 317: Cf. chaps. 59 and 62, but more especially 63.]

[Footnote 318: At that time the Roman Church did not confine herself to a letter; she sent
ambassadors to Corinth, [Greek: hoitines martures esontai metaxu humôn kai hêmôn]. Note carefully
also the position of the Corinthian community with which the Roman one interfered (see on this
point Wrede, Untersuchungen zum I Clemensbrief, 1891.)]

[Footnote 319: In Ignatius, Rom. inscr., the verb [Greek: prokathêmai] is twice used about
the Roman Church ([Greek: prokathêtai en] [to be understood in a local sense] [Greek: topôi
khôrion Rhômaiôn]--[Greek: prokathêmenê tês agapês] = presiding in, or having the guardianship
of, love). Ignatius (Magn. 6), uses the same verb to denote the dignity of the bishop or presbyters
in relation to the community. See, besides, the important testimony in Rom. II.: [Greek: allous
edidaxate]. Finally, it must be also noted that Ignatius presupposes an extensive influence
on the part of individual members of the Church in the higher spheres of government. Fifty
years later we have a memorable proof of this in the Marcia-Victor episode. Lastly, Ignatius
is convinced that the Church will interfeie quite as energetically on behalf of a foreign brother
as on behalf of one of her own number. In the Epistle of Clement to James, c. 2, the Roman
bishop is called [Greek: ho alêtheias prokathezomenos].]

[Footnote 320: Euseb., H. E. IV. 23. 9-12; cf., above all, the words: [Greek: Ex archês humin
ethos esti touto, pantas men adelphous poikiôs euergetein, ekklêsiais te pollais tais kata
pasan polin ephodia pempein ... patroparadoton ethos Rhômaiôn Rômaioi diaphulattontes.] Note
here the emphasis laid on [Greek: Rômaioi].]

[Footnote 321: According to Irenæus a peculiar significance belongs to the old Jerusalem Church,
in so far as all the Christian congregations sprang from her (III. 12. 5: [Greek: autai phônai
tês ekklêsias, ex hês pasa eschêken ekklêsia tês archên autai phônai tês mêtropoleôs tôn tês
kainês diathêkês politôn]). For obvious reasons Irenæus did not speak of the Jerusalem Church
of his own time. Hence that passage cannot be utilised.]

[Footnote 322: Iren. III. 3. i: "Sed quomiam valde longum est, in hoc tali volumine omnium
ecclesiarum enumerare successiones, maximæ et antiquissimæ et omnibus cognitæ, a gloriosissimis
duobus apostolis Paulo et Petro Romæ fundatæ et constitutæ ecclesiæ, eam quam habet ab apostolis
traditionem et annuutiatam hominibus fidem, per successiones episcoporum pervenientem usque
ad nos indicantes confundimus omnes eos, qui quoquo modo vel per sibiplacentiam malam vel vanam
gloriam vel per cæcitatem et malam sententiam, præterquam oportet, colligunt. Ad hanc enim
ecclesiam propter potentiorem principalitatem necesse est omnem convenire ecclesiam, hoc est,
eos qui sunt undique fideles, in qua semper ab his, qui sunt undique, conservata est ea quæ
est ab apostolis traditio." On this we may remark as follows: (1) The special importance which
Irenæus claims for the Roman Church--for he is only referring to her--is not merely based by
him on her assumed foundation by Peter and Paul, but on a combination of the four attributes
"maxima," "antiquissima" etc. Dionysius of Corinth also made this assumption (Euseb., II. 25.
8), but applied it quite as much to the Corinthian Church. As regards capability of proving
the truth of the Church's faith, all the communities founded by the Apostles possess principalitas
in relation to the others; but the Roman Church has the potentior principalitas, in so far
as she excels all the rest in her qualities of ecclesia maxima et omnibus cognita etc. Principalitas
= "sovereign authority," [Greek: authentia], for this was probably the word in the original
text (see proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science, 9th Nov., 1893). In common
with most scholars I used to think that the "in qua" refers to "Roman Church;" but I have now
convinced myself (see the treatise just cited) that it relates to "omnem ecclesiam," and that
the clause introduced by "in qua" merely asserts that every church, in so far as she is faithful
to tradition, i.e., orthodox, must as a matter of course agree with that of Rome. (2) Irenæus
asserts that every Church, i.e., believers in all parts of the world, must agree with this
Church ("convenire" is to be understood in a figurative sense; the literal acceptation "every
Church must come to that of Rome" is not admissible). However, this "must" is not meant as
an imperative, but == [Greek: anagkê] == "it cannot be otherwise." In reference to principalitas
== [Greek: authentia] (see I. 31. 1: I. 26. 1) it must be remembered that Victor of Rome (l.c.)
speaks of the "origo authentici apostolatus," and Tertullian remarks of Valentinus when he
apostatised at Rome, "ab ecclesia authenticæ regulæ abrupit" (adv. Valent. 4).]

[Footnote 323: Beyond doubt his "convenire necesse est" is founded on actual circumstances.]

[Footnote 324: On other important journeys of Christian men and bishops to Rome in the 2nd
and 3rd centuries see Caspari, l.c. Above all we may call attention to the journey of Abercius
of Hierapolis (not Hierapolis on the Meander) about 200 or even earlier. Its historical reality
is not to be questioned. See his words in the epitaph composed by himself (V. 7 f.): [Greek:
eis Rhômên hos epempsen emen basilêan athrêsai kai basilissan idein chrusostolon chrusopedilon].
However, Ficker raises very serious objections to the Christian origin of the inscription.]

[Footnote 325: We cannot here discuss how this tradition arose; in all likelihood it already
expresses the position which the Roman Church very speedily attained in Christendom. See Renan,
Orig., Vol. VII., p. 70: "Pierre el Paul (léconciliés), voilà le chef-d'oeuvre qui fondait
la suprématie ecclésiastique de Rome dans làvenir. Une nouvelle qualité mythique lemplagait
celle de Romulus et Remus." But it is highly probable that Peter was really in Rome like Paul
(see 1 Clem. V., Ignatius ad Rom. IV.); both really performed important services to the Church
there, and died as martyrs in that city.]

[Footnote 326: The wealth of the Roman Church is also illustrated by the present of 200,000
sesterces brought her by Marcion (Tertull., de præse. 30). The "Shepherd" also contains instructive
particulars with regard to this. As far as her influence is concerned, we possess various testimonies
from Philipp. IV. 22 down to the famous account by Hippolytus of the relations of Victor to
Marcia. We may call special attention to Ignatius' Epistle to the Romans.]

[Footnote 327: See Tertullian, adv. Prax. I; Euseb., H. E. V. 3, 4. Dictionary of Christian
Biography III., p. 937.]

[Footnote 328: Euseb, H.E. V. 24. 9: [Greek: epi toutois ho men tês Rhômaiôn proestôs Biktôr
athroôs tês Asias pasês hama tais homorois ekklêsiais tas paroikias apotemnein hôsan heterodoxousas,
tês koinês henôseôs peiratai, kai stêliteuei ge dia grammatôn, akoinônêtous pantas ardên tous
ekeise anakêruttôn adelphous]. Stress should be laid on two points here: (1) Victor proclaimed
that the people of Asia Minor were to be excluded from the [Greek: koinê henôsis], and not
merely from the fellowship of the Roman Church; (2) he based the excommunication on the alleged
heterodoxy of those Churches. See Heinichen, Melet. VIII, on Euseb., l.c. Victor's action is
parallelled by that of Stephen. Firmilian says to the latter: "Dum enim putas, omnes abs te
abstineri posse, solum te ab omnibus abstinuisti." It is a very instructive fact that in the
4th century Rome also made the attempt to have Sabbath fasting established as an apostolic
custom. See the interesting work confuted by Augustine (ep. 36), a writing which emanates from
a Roman author who is unfortunately unknown to us. Cf. also Augustine's 54th and 55th epistles.]

[Footnote 329: Irenæus also (l.c. § 11) does not appear to have questioned Victor's proceeding
as such, but as applied to this particular case.]

[Footnote 330: See Tertull., de orat. 22: "Sed non putet institutionem unusquisque antecessoris
commovendam." De virg. vel. I: "Paracletus solus antecessor, quia solus post Christum;" 2:
"Eas ego ecclesias proposui, quas et ipsi apostolici viri condiderunt, et puto ante quosdam;"
3: "Sed nec inter consuetudines dispicere voluerunt illi sanctissimi antecessores." This is
also the question referred to in the important remark in Jerome, de vir. inl. 53: "Tertullianus
ad mediam ætatem presbyter fuit ecclesiæ Africanæ, invidia postea et contumeliis clericorum
Romanæ ecclesiæ ad Montani dogma delapsus."]

[Footnote 331: Stephen acted like Victor and excluded almost all the East from the fellowship
of the Church; see in addition to Cyprian's epistles that of Dionysius of Alexandria in Euseb.,
H. E. VII. 5. In reference to Hippolytus, see Philosoph. l. IX. In regard to Origen, see the
allusions in de orat. 14; in Joh. X. 16; Rom. VI in Isai. c. 1. With regard to Philosoph. IX.
12, Sohm rightly remarks (p. 389): "It is clear that the responsibility was laid on the Roman
bishop not merely in several cases where married men were made presbyters and deacons, but
also when they were appointed bishops; and it is also evident that he appears just as responsible
when bishops are not deposed in consequence of their marrying." One cannot help concluding
that the Roman bishop has the power of appointing and deposing not merely presbyters and deacons,
but also bishops. Moreover, the impression is conveyed that this appointment and deposition
of bishops takes place in Rome, for the passage contains a description of existent conditions
in the Roman Church. Other communities may be deprived of their bishops by an order from Rome,
and a bishop (chosen in Rome) may be sent them. (Abhandlungen fur Weizsäcker, 1892), I have
shown how the Roman clergy kept the revenue of the Church and of the Churches in their hands,
though they had no bishop. What language the Romans used in epistles 8, 30, 36 of the Cyprian
collection, and how they interfered in the affairs of the Carthaginian Church! Beyond doubt
the Roman Church possessed an acknowledged primacy in the year 250; it was the primacy of active
participation and fulfilled duty. As yet there was no recognised dogmatic or historic foundation
assigned for it; in fact it is highly probable that this theory was still shaky and uncertain
in Rome herself. The college of presbyters and deacons feels and speaks as if it were the bishop.
For it was not on the bishop that the incomparable prestige of Rome was based--at least this
claim was not yet made with any confidence,--but on the city itself, on the origin and history,
the faith and love, the earnestness and zeal of the whole Roman Church and her clergy.]

[Footnote 333: In Tertullian, de præsc. 36, the bishops are not mentioned. He also, like Irenæus,
cites the Roman Church as one amongst others. We have already remarked that in the scheme of
proof from prescription no higher rank could be assigned to the Roman Church than to any other
of the group founded by the Apostles. Tertullian continues to maintain this position, but expressly
remarks that the Roman Church has special authority for the Carthaginian, because Carthage
had received its Christianity from Rome. He expresses the special relationship between Rome
and Carthage in the following terms: "Si autem Italiæ adiaces habes Romam, unde nobis quoque
auctoritas præsto est." With Tertullian, then, the de facto position of the Roman Church in
Christendom did not lead to the same conclusion in the scheme of proof from prescription as
we found in Irenæus. But in his case also that position is indicated by the rhetorical ardour
with which he speaks of the Roman Church, whereas he does nothing more than mention Corinth,
Philippi, Thessalonica, and Ephesus. Even at that time, moreover, he had ground enough for
a more reserved attitude towards Rome, though in the antignostic struggle he could not dispense
with the tradition of the Roman community. In the veil dispute (de virg. vel. 2) he opposed
the authority of the Greek apostolic Churches to that of Rome. Polycarp had done the same against
Anicetus, Polycrates against Victor, Proculus against his Roman opponents. Conversely, Praxeas
in his appeal to Eleutherus (c. 1.: "præcessorum auctoritates"), Caius when contending with
Proculus, the Carthaginian clergy when opposing Tertullian (in the veil dispute), and Victor
when contending with Polycrates set the authority of Rome against that of the Greek apostolic
Churches. These struggles at the transition from the and to the 3rd century are of the utmost
importance. Rome was here seeking to overthrow the authority of the only group of Churches
able to enter into rivalry with her those of Asia Minor, and succeeded in the attempt.]

[Footnote 334: De pudic. 21: "De tua nunc sententia quæro, unde hoc ius ecclesiæ usurpes. Si
quia dixerit Petro dominus: Super hanc petram ædificabo ecclesiam meam, tibi dedi claves regni
cælestis, vel, Quæcumque alligaveris vel solveris in terra, erunt alligata vel soluta in coelis,
id circo præsumis et ad te derivasse solvendi et alligandi potestatem?" Stephen did the same;
see Firmilian in Cyprian ep. 75. With this should be compared the description Clement of Rome
gives in his epistles to James of his own installation by Peter (c. 2). The following words
are put in Peter's mouth: [Greek: klêmenta touton episkopon humin cheirontonô, hô tên emên
tôn logôn pisteuô kathedran ... dia autô metadidômi tên exousian tou desmeuein kai luein, hina
peri pantos ou an cheirotonêsê epi gês estai dedogmatismenon en ouranois. dêsei gar ho dei
dethênai kai lusei ho dei luthênai, hôs ton tês ekklêsias eidôs kanona.]]

[Footnote 335: See Dionysius of Alexandria's letter to the Roman bishop Stephen (Euseb., H.
E. VII. 5. 2): [Greek: Hai mentoi Suriai holai kai hê Arabia, ois eparkeite hekastote kai ois
nun epesteilate.]]

[Footnote 336: In the case of Origen's condemnation the decision of Rome seems to have been
of special importance. Origen sought to defend his orthodoxy in a letter written by his own
hand to the Roman bishop Fabian (see Euseb., H. E. VI. 36; Jerome, ep. 84. 10). The Roman bishop
Pontian had previously condemned him after summoning a "senate;" see Jerome, ep. 33 (Döllinger,
Hippolytus and Calixtus, p. 259 f.). Further, it is an important fact that a deputation of
Alexandrian Christians, who did not agree with the Christology of their bishop Dionysius, repaired
to Rome to the Roman bishop Dionysius and formally accused the first named prelate. It is also
significant that Dionysius received this complaint and brought the matter up at a Roman synod.
No objection was taken to this proceeding (Athanas., de synod.). This information is very instructive,
for it proves that the Roman Church was ever regarded as specially charged with watching over
the observance of the conditions of the general ecclesiastical federation, the [Greek: koinê
henôsis]. As to the fact that in circular letters, not excepting Eastern ones, the Roman Church
was put at the head of the address, see Euseb., H. E. VII. 30. How frequently foreign bishops
came to Rome is shown by the 19th canon of Arles (A.D. 314): "De episcopis peregrinis, qui
in urbem solent venire, placuit iis locum dari ut offerant." The first canon is also important
in deciding the special position of Rome.]

[Footnote 337: Peculiar circumstances, which unfortunately we cannot quite explain, are connected
with the cases discussed by Cyprian in epp. 67 and 68. The Roman bishop must have had the acknowledged
power of dealing with the bishop of Arles, whereas the Gallic prelates had not this right.
Sohm, p. 391 ff., assumes that the Roman bishop alone--not Cyprian or the bishops of Gaul--had
authority to exclude the bishop of Arles from the general fellowship of the Church, but that,
as far as the Gallic Churches were concerned, such an excommunication possessed no legal effect,
but only a moral one, because in their case the bishop of Rome had only a spiritual authority
and no legal power. Further, two Spanish bishops publicly appealed to the Roman see against
their deposition, and Cyprian regarded this appeal as in itself correct. Finally, Cornelius
says of himself in a letter (in Euseb., H. E. VI. 43. 10): [Greek: tôn loipôn episkopôn diadochous
eis tous topous, en hois êsan, cheirotonêsantes apestalkamen]. This quotation refers to Italy,
and the passage, which must be read connectedly, makes it plain (see, besides, the quotation
in reference to Calixtus given above on p. 162), that, before the middle of the 3rd century,
the Roman Church already possessed a legal right of excommunication and the recognised power
of making ecclesiastical appointments as far as the communities and bishops in Italy were concerned
(see Sohm, p. 389 ff.).]

[Footnote 338: Euseb., H. E. VII. 30. 19. The Church of Antioch sought to enter upon an independent
line of development under Paul of Samosata. Paul's fall was the victory of Rome. We may suppose
it to be highly probable, though to the best of my belief there is for the present no sure
proof, that it was not till then that the Roman standards and sacraments, catholic and apostolic
collection of Scriptures (see, on the contrary, the use of Scripture in the Didaskalia), apostolic
rule of faith, and apostolic episcopacy attained supremacy in Antioch; but that they began
to be introduced into that city about the time of Serapion's bishopric (that is, during the
Easter controversy). The old records of the Church of Edessa have an important bearing on this
point; and from these it is evident that her constitution did not begin to assume a Catholic
form till the beginning of the 3rd century, and that as the result of connection with Rome.
See the Doctrine of Addai by Phillips, p. 50: "Palut himself went to Antioch and received the
hand of the priesthood from Serapion, bishop of Antioch. Serapion, bishop of Antioch, himself
also received the hand from Zephyrinus, bishop of the city of Rome, from the succession of
the hand of the priesthood of Simon Cephas, which he received from our Lord, who was there
bishop of Rome 25 years, (sic) in the days of the Cæsar, who reigned there 13 years." (See
also Tixeront, Edesse, pp. 149, 152.) Cf. with this the prominence given in the Acts of Scharbil
and Barsamya to the fact that they were contemporaries of Fabian, bishop of Rome. We read there
(see Rubens Duval, Les Actes de Scharbil et les Actes de Barsamya, Paris, 1889, and Histoire
d'Eclesse, p. 130): "Barsamya (he was bishop of Edessa at the time of Decius) lived at the
time of Fabian, bishop of Rome. He had received the laying on of hands from Abschelama, who
had received it from Palut. Palut had been consecrated by Serapion, bishop of Antioch, and
the latter had been consecrated by Zephyrinus, bishop of Rome." As regards the relation of
the State of Rome to the Roman Church, that is, to the Roman bishop, who by the year 250 had
already become a sort of præfectus urbis, with his district superintendents, the deacons, and
in fact a sort of princeps æmulus, cf. (1) the recorded comments of Alexander Severus on the
Christians, and especially those on their organisation; (2) the edict of Maximinus Thrax and
the banishment of the bishops Pontian and Hippolytus; (3) the attitude of Philip the Arabian;
(4) the remarks of Decius in Cyp. ep. 55 (see above p. 124) and his proceedings against the
Roman bishops, and (5) the attitude of Aurelian in Antioch. On the extent and organisation
of the Roman Church about 250 see Euseb., H. E. VI. 43.]

[Footnote 339: The memorable words in the lately discovered appeal by Eusebius of Dorylæum
to Leo I. (Neues Archiv., Vol. XI., part 2, p. 364 f.) are no mere flattery, and the fifth
century is not the first to which they are applicable: "Curavit desuper et ab exordio consuevit
thronus apostolicus iniqua perferentes defensare et eos qui in evitabiles factiones inciderunt,
adiuvare et humi iacentes erigere, secundum possibilitatem, quam habetis; causa autem rei,
quod sensum rectum tenetis et inconcussam servatis erga dominum nostrum Iesum Christum fidem,
nec non etiam indissimulatam universis fratribus et omnibus in nomine Christi vocatis tribuitis
caritatem, etc." They were convinced that the Christian faith was founded on revelation and
that only a mind enlightened by God could grasp and maintain the faith. They acknowledged the
Old Testament to be the authoritative source of God's revelation, maintained that the whole
human race was meant to be reached by Christianity, and adhered to the early Christian eschatology.
These views as well as the strong emphasis they laid upon human freedom and responsibility,
enabled them to attain a firm standpoint in opposition to "Gnosticism," and to preserve their
position within the Christian communities, whose moral purity and strength they regarded as
a strong proof of the truth of this faith. In the endeavours of the Apologists to explain Christianity
to the cultured world, we have before us the attempts of Greek churchmen to represent the Christian
religion as a philosophy, and to convince outsiders that it was the highest wisdom and the
absolute truth. These efforts were not rejected by the Churches like those of the so-called
Gnostics, but rather became in subsequent times the foundation of the ecclesiastical dogmatic.
The Gnostic speculations were repudiated, whereas those of the Apologists were accepted. The
manner in which the latter set forth Christianity as a philosophy met with approval. What were
the conditions under which ecclesiastical Christianity and Greek philosophy concluded the alliance
which has found a place in the history of the world? How did this union attain acceptance and
permanence, whilst "Gnosticism" was at first rejected? These are the two great questions the
correct answers to which are of fundamental importance for the understanding of the history
of Christian dogma.

The answers to these questions appear paradoxical. The theses of the Apologists finally overcame
all scruples in ecclesiastical circles and were accepted by the Græco-Roman world, because
they made Christianity rational without taking from, or adding to, its traditional historic
material. The secret of the epoch-making success of the apologetic theology is thus explained:
These Christian philosophers formulated the content of the Gospel in a manner which appealed
to the common sense of all the serious thinkers and intelligent men of the age. Moreover, they
contrived to use the positive material of tradition, including the life and worship of Christ,
in such a way as to furnish this reasonable religion with a confirmation and proof that had
hitherto been eagerly sought, but sought in vain. In the theology of the Apologists, Christianity,
as the religious enlightenment directly emanating from God himself, is most sharply contrasted
with all polytheism, natural religion, and ceremonial. They proclaimed it in the most emphatic
manner as the religion of the spirit, of freedom, and of absolute morality. Almost the whole
positive material of Christianity is embodied in the story which relates its entrance into
the world, its spread, and the proof of its truth. The religion itself, on the other hand,
appears as the truth that is surely attested and accords with reason--a truth the content of
which is not primarily dependent on historical facts and finally overthrows all polytheism.

Now this was the very thing required. In the second century of our era a great many needs and
aspirations were undoubtedly making themselves felt in the sphere of religion and morals. "Gnosticism"
and Marcionite Christianity prove the variety and depth of the needs then asserting themselves
within the space that the ecclesiastical historian is able to survey. Mightier than all others,
however, was the longing men felt to free themselves from the burden of the past, to cast away
the rubbish of cults and of unmeaning religious ceremonies, and to be assured that the results
of religious philosophy, those great and simple doctrines of virtue and immortality and of
the God who is a Spirit, were certain truths. He who brought the message that these ideas were
realities, and who, on the strength of these realities, declared polytheism and the worship
of idols to be obsolete, had the mightiest forces on his side; for the times were now ripe
for this preaching. What formed the strength of the apologetic philosophy was the proclamation
that Christianity both contained the highest truth, as men already supposed it to be and as
they had discovered it in their own minds, and the absolutely reliable guarantee that was desired
for this truth. To the quality which makes it appear meagre to us it owed its impressiveness.
The fact of its falling in with the general spiritual current of the time and making no attempt
to satisfy special and deeper needs enabled it to plead the cause of spiritual monotheism and
to oppose the worship of idols in the manner most easily understood. As it did not require
historic and positive material to describe the nature of religion and morality, this philosophy
enabled the Apologists to demonstrate the worthlessness of the traditional religion and worship
of the different nations.[342] The same cause, however, made them take up the conservative
position with regard to the historical traditions of Christianity. These were not ultimately
tested as to their content, for this was taken for granted, no matter how they might be worded;
but they were used to give an assurance of the truth, and to prove that the religion of the
spirit was not founded on human opinion, but on divine revelation. The only really important
consideration in Christianity is that it is revelation, real revelation. The Apologists had
no doubt as to what it reveals, and therefore any investigation was unnecessary. The result
of Greek philosophy, the philosophy of Plato and Zeno, as it had further developed in the empires
of Alexander the Great and the Romans, was to attain victory and permanence by the aid of Christianity.
Thus we view the progress of this development to-day,[343] and Christianity really proved to
be the force from which that religious philosophy, viewed as a theory of the world and system
of morality, first received the courage to free itself from the polytheistic past and descend
from the circles of the learned to the common people.

This constitutes the deepest distinction between Christian philosophers like Justin and those
of the type of Valentinus. The latter sought for a religion; the former, though indeed they
were not very clear about their own purpose, sought assurance as to a theistic and moral conception
of the world which they already possessed. At first the complexus of Christian tradition, which
must have possessed many features of attraction for them, was something foreign to both. The
latter, however, sought to make this tradition intelligible. For the former it was enough that
they had here a revelation before them; that this revelation also bore unmistakable testimony
to the one God, who was a Spirit, to virtue, and to immortality; and that it was capable of
convincing men and of leading them to a virtuous life. Viewed superficially, the Apologists
were no doubt the conservatives; but they were so, because they scarcely in any respect meddled
with the contents of tradition. The "Gnostics," on the contrary, sought to understand what
they read and to investigate the truth of the message of which they heard. The most characteristic
feature is the attitude of each to the Old Testament. The Apologists were content to have found
in it an ancient source of revelation, and viewed the book as a testimony to the truth, i.e.,
to philosophy and virtue; the Gnostics investigated this document and examined to what extent
it agreed with the new impressions they had received from the Gospel. We may sum up as follows:
The Gnostics sought to determine what Christianity is as a religion, and, as they were convinced
of the absoluteness of Christianity, this process led them to incorporate with it all that
they looked on as sublime and holy and to remove everything they recognised to be inferior.
The Apologists, again, strove to discover an authority for religious enlightenment and morality
and to find the confirmation of a theory of the universe, which, if true, contained for them
the certainty of eternal life; and this they found in the Christian tradition.

At bottom this contrast is a picture of the great discord existing in the religious philosophy
of the age itself (see p. 129, vol. I.). No one denied the fact that all truth was divine,
that is, was founded on revelation. The great question, however, was whether every man possessed
this truth as a slumbering capacity that only required to be awakened; whether it was rational,
i.e., merely moral truth, or must be above that which is moral, that is, of a religious nature;
whether it must carry man beyond himself; and whether a real redemption was necessary. It is
ultimately the dispute between morality and religion, which appears as an unsettled problem
in the theses of the idealistic philosophers and in the whole spiritual conceptions then current
among the educated, and which recurs in the contrast between the Apologetic and the Gnostic
theology. And, as in the former case we meet with the most varied shades and transitions, for
no one writer has developed a consistent theory, so also we find a similar state of things
in the latter;[344] for no Apologist quite left out of sight the idea of redemption (deliverance
from the dominion of demons can only be effected by the Logos, i.e., God). Wherever the idea
of freedom is strongly emphasised, the religious element, in the strict sense of the word,
appears in jeopardy. This is the case with the Apologists throughout. Conversely, wherever
redemption forms the central thought, need is felt of a suprarational truth, which no longer
views morality as the only aim, and which, again, requires particular media, a sacred history
and sacred symbols. Stoic rationalism, in its logical development, is menaced wherever we meet
the perception that the course of the world must in some way be helped, and wherever the contrast
between reason and sensuousness, that the old Stoa had confused, is clearly felt to be an unendurable
state of antagonism that man cannot remove by his own unaided efforts. The need of a revelation
had its starting-point in philosophy here. The judgment of oneself and of the world to which
Platonism led, the self-consciousness which it awakened by the detachment of man from nature,
and the contrasts which it revealed led of necessity to that frame of mind which manifested
itself in the craving for a revelation. The Apologists felt this. But their rationalism gave
a strange turn to the satisfaction of that need. It was not their Christian ideas which first
involved them in contradictions. At the time when Christianity appeared on the scene, the Platonic
and Stoic systems themselves were already so complicated that philosophers did not find their
difficulties seriously increased by a consideration of the Christian doctrines. As Apologists,
however, they decidedly took the part of Christianity because, according to them, it was the
doctrine of reason and freedom.

The Gospel was hellenised in the second century in so far as the Gnostics in various ways transformed
it into a Hellenic religion for the educated. The Apologists used it--we may almost say inadvertently--to
overthrow polytheism by maintaining that Christianity was the realisation of an absolutely
moral theism. The Christian religion was not the first to experience this twofold destiny on
Græco-Roman soil. A glance at the history of the Jewish religion shows us a parallel development;
in fact, both the speculations of the Gnostics and the theories of the Apologists were foreshadowed
in the theology of the Jewish Alexandrians, and particularly in that of Philo. Here also the
Gospel merely entered upon the heritage of Judaism.[345] Three centuries before the appearance
of Christian Apologists, Jews, who had received a Hellenic training, had already set forth
the religion of Jehovah to the Greeks in that remarkably summary and spiritualised form which
represents it as the absolute and highest philosophy, i.e., the knowledge of God, of virtue,
and of recompense in the next world. Here these Jewish philosophers had already transformed
all the positive and historic elements of the national religion into parts of a huge system
for proving the truth of that theism. The Christian Apologists adopted this method, for they
can hardly be said to have invented it anew.[346] We see from the Jewish Sibylline oracles
how wide-spread it was. Philo, however, was not only a Stoic rationalist, but a hyper-Platonic
religious philosopher. In like manner, the Christian Apologists did not altogether lack this
element, though in some isolated cases among them there are hardly any traces of it. This feature
is most fully represented among the Gnostics.

This transformation of religion into a philosophic system would not have been possible had
not Greek philosophy itself happened to be in process of development into a religion. Such
a transformation was certainly very foreign to the really classical time of Greece and Rome.
The pious belief in the efficacy and power of the gods and in their appearances and manifestations,
as well as the traditional worship, could have no bond of union with speculations concerning
the essence and ultimate cause of things. The idea of a religious dogma which was at once to
furnish a correct theory of the world and a principle of conduct was from this standpoint completely
unintelligible. But philosophy, particularly in the Stoa, set out in search of this idea, and,
after further developments, sought for one special religion with which it could agree or through
which it could at least attain certainty. The meagre cults of the Greeks and Romans were unsuited
for this. So men turned their eyes towards the barbarians. Nothing more clearly characterises
the position of things in the second century than the agreement between two men so radically
different as Tatian and Celsus. Tatian emphatically declares that salvation comes from the
barbarians, and to Celsus it is also a "truism" that the barbarians have more capacity than
the Greeks for discovering valuable doctrines.[347] Everything was in fact prepared, and nothing
was wanting.

About the middle of the second century, however, the moral and rationalistic element in the
philosophy and spiritual culture of the time was still more powerful than the religious and
mystic; for Neoplatonism, which under its outward coverings concealed the aspiration after
religion and the living God, was only in its first beginnings. It was not otherwise in Christian
circles. The "Gnostics" were in the minority. What the great majority of the Church felt to
be intelligible and edifying above everything else was an earnest moralism.[348] New and strange
as the undertaking to represent Christianity as a philosophy might seem at first, the Apologists,
so far as they were understood, appeared to advance nothing inconsistent with Christian common
sense. Besides, they did not question authorities, but rather supported them, and introduced
no foreign positive materials. For all these reasons, and also because their writings were
not at first addressed to the communities, but only to outsiders, the marvellous attempt to
present Christianity to the world as the religion which is the true philosophy, and as the
philosophy which is the true religion, remained unopposed in the Church. But in what sense
was the Christian religion set forth as a philosophy? An exact answer to this question is of
the highest interest as regards the history of Christian dogma.

2. Christianity as Philosophy and as Revelation.

It was a new undertaking and one of permanent importance to a tradition hitherto so little
concerned for its own vindication, when Quadratus and the Athenian philosopher, Aristides,
presented treatises in defence of Christianity to the emperor.[349] About a century had elapsed
since the Gospel of Christ had begun to be preached. It may be said that the Apology of Aristides
was a most significant opening to the second century, whilst we find Origen at its close. Marcianus
Aristides expressly designates himself in his pamphlet as a philosopher of the Athenians. Since
the days when the words were written: "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
vain deceit" (Col. II. 8), it had constantly been repeated (see, as evidence, Celsus, passim)
that Christian preaching and philosophy were things entirely different, that God had chosen
the fools, and that man's duty was not to investigate and seek, but to believe and hope. Now
a philosopher, as such, pleaded the cause of Christianity. In the summary he gave of the content
of Christianity at the beginning of his address, he really spoke as a philosopher and represented
this faith as a philosophy. By expounding pure monotheism and giving it the main place in his
argument, Aristides gave supreme prominence to the very doctrine which simple Christians also
prized as the most important.[350] Moreover, in emphasing not only the supernatural character
of the Christian doctrine revealed by the Son of the Most High God, but also the continuous
inspiration of believers--the new race (not a new school)--he confessed in the most express
way the peculiar nature of this philosophy as a divine truth. According to him Christianity
is philosophy because its content is in accordance with reason, and because it gives a satisfactory
and universally intelligible answer to the questions with which all real philosophers have
concerned themselves. But it is no philosophy, in fact it is really the complete opposite of
this, in so far as it proceeds from revelation and is propagated by the agency of God, i.e.,
has a supernatural and divine origin, on which alone the truth and certainty of its doctrines
finally depend. This contrast to philosophy is chiefly shown in the unphilosophical form in
which Christianity was first preached to the world. That is the thesis maintained by all the
Apologists from Justin to Tertullian,[351] and which Jewish philosophers before them propounded
and defended. This proposition may certainly be expressed in a great variety of ways. In the
first place, it is important whether the first or second half is emphasised, and secondly,
whether that which is "universally intelligible" is to be reckoned as philosophy at all, or
is to be separated from it as that which comes by "nature." Finally, the attitude to be taken
up towards the Greek philosophers is left an open question, so that the thesis, taking up this
attitude as a starting-point, may again assume various forms. But was the contradiction which
it contains not felt? The content of revelation is to be rational; but does that which is rational
require a revelation? How the proposition was understood by the different Apologists requires
examination.

Aristides. He first gives an exposition of monotheism and the monotheistic cosmology (God as
creator and mover of the universe, as the spiritual, perfect, almighty Being, whom all things
need, and who requires nothing). In the second chapter he distinguishes, according to the Greek
text, three, and, according to the Syriac, four classes of men (in the Greek text polytheists,
Jews, Christians, the polytheists being divided into Chaldeans, Greeks, and Egyptians; in the
Syriac barbarians, Greeks, Jews, Christians), and gives their origin. He derives the Christians
from Jesus Christ and reproduces the Christian kerygma (Son of the Most High God, birth from
the Virgin, 12 disciples, death on the cross, burial, resurrection, ascension, missionary labours
of the 12 disciples). After this, beginning with the third chapter, follows a criticism of
polytheism, that is, the false theology of the barbarians, Greeks, and Egyptians (down to chapter
12). In the 13th chapter the Greek authors and philosophers are criticised, and the Greek myths,
as such, are shown to be false. In the 14th chapter the Jews are introduced (they are monotheists
and their ethical system is praised; but they are then reproached with worshipping of angels
and a false ceremonial). In the 15th chapter follows a description of the Christians, i.e.,
above all, of their pure, holy life. It is they who have found the truth, because they know
the creator of heaven and earth. This description is continued in chapters 16 and 17: "This
people is new and there is a divine admixture in it." The Christian writings are recommended
to the emperor.

Justin.[352] In his treatise addressed to the emperor Justin did not call himself a philosopher
as Aristides had done. In espousing the cause of the hated and despised Christians he represented
himself as a simple member of that sect. But in the very first sentence of his Apology he takes
up the ground of piety and philosophy, the very ground taken up by the pious and philosophical
emperors themselves, according to the judgment of the time and their own intention. In addressing
them he appeals to the [Greek: logos sôphrôn] in a purely Stoic fashion. He opposes the truth--also
in the Stoic manner--to the [Greek: doxais palaiôn].[353] It was not to be a mere captatio
benevolentiæ. In that case Justin would not have added: "That ye are pious and wise and guardians
of righteousness and friends of culture, ye hear everywhere. Whether ye are so, however, will
be shown."[354] His whole exordium is calculated to prove to the emperors that they are in
danger of repeating a hundredfold the crime which the judges of Socrates had committed.[355]
Like a second Socrates Justin speaks to the emperors in the name of all Christians. They are
to hear the convictions of the wisest of the Greeks from the mouth of the Christians. Justin
wishes to enlighten the emperor with regard to the life and doctrines ([Greek: bios kai mathêmata])
of the latter. Nothing is to be concealed, for there is nothing to conceal.

Justin kept this promise better than any of his successors. For that very reason also he did
not depict the Christian Churches as schools of philosophers (cc. 61-67). Moreover, in the
first passage where he speaks of Greek philosophers,[356] he is merely drawing a parallel.
According to him there are bad Christians and seeming Christians, just as there are philosophers
who are only so in name and outward show. Such men, too, were in early times called "philosophers"
even when they preached atheism. To all appearance, therefore, Justin does not desire Christians
to be reckoned as philosophers. But it is nevertheless significant that, in the case of the
Christians, a phenomenon is being repeated which otherwise is only observed in the case of
philosophers; and how were those whom he was addressing to understand him? In the same passage
he speaks for the first time of Christ. He introduces him with the plain and intelligible formula:
[Greek: ho didaskalos Christos] ("the teacher Christ").[357] Immediately thereafter he praises
Socrates because he had exposed the worthlessness and deceit of the evil demons, and traces
his death to the same causes which are now he says bringing about the condemnation of the Christians.
Now he can make his final assertion. In virtue of "reason" Socrates exposed superstition; in
virtue of the same reason, this was done by the teacher whom the Christians follow. But this
teacher was reason itself; it was visible in him, and indeed it appeared bodily in him.[358]

Is this philosophy or is it myth? The greatest paradox the Apologist has to assert is connected
by him with the most impressive remembrance possessed by his readers as philosophers. In the
same sentence where he represents Christ as the Socrates of the barbarians,[359] and consequently
makes Christianity out to be a Socratic doctrine, he propounds the unheard of theory that the
teacher Christ is the incarnate reason of God.

Justin nowhere tried to soften the effect of this conviction or explain it in a way adapted
to his readers. Nor did he conceal from them that his assertion admits of no speculative demonstration.
That philosophy can only deal with things which ever are, because they ever were, since this
world began, is a fact about which he himself is perfectly clear. No Stoic could have felt
more strongly than Justin how paradoxical is the assertion that a thing is of value which has
happened only once. Certain as he is that the "reasonable" emperors will regard it as a rational
assumption that "Reason" is the Son of God,[360] he knows equally well that no philosophy will
bear him out in that other assertion, and that such a statement is seemingly akin to the contemptible
myths of the evil demons.

But there is certainly a proof which, if not speculative, is nevertheless sure. The same ancient
documents, which contain the Socratic and super-Socratic wisdom of the Christians, bear witness
through prophecies, which, just because they are predictions, admit of no doubt, that the teacher
Christ is the incarnate reason; for history confirms the word of prophecy even in the minutest
details. Moreover, in so far as these writings are in the lawful possession of the Christians,
and announced at the very beginning of things that this community would appear on the earth,
they testify that the Christians may in a certain fashion date themselves back to the beginning
of the world, because their doctrine is as old as the earth itself (this thought is still wanting
in Aristides).

The new Socrates who appeared among the barbarians is therefore quite different from the Socrates
of the Greeks, and for that reason also his followers are not to be compared with the disciples
of the philosophers.[361] From the very beginning of things a world-historical dispensation
of God announced this reasonable doctrine through prophets, and prepared the visible appearance
of reason itself. The same reason which created and arranged the world took human form in order
to draw the whole of humanity to itself. Every precaution has been taken to make it easy for
any one, be he Greek or barbarian, educated or uneducated, to grasp all the doctrines of this
reason, to verify their truth, and test their power in life. What further importance can philosophy
have side by side with this, how can one think of calling this a philosophy?

And yet the doctrine of the Christians can only be compared with philosophy. For, so far as
the latter is genuine, it is also guided by the Logos; and, conversely, what the Christians
teach concerning the Father of the world, the destiny of man, the nobility of his nature, freedom
and virtue, justice and recompense, has also been attested by the wisest of the Greeks. They
indeed only stammered, whereas the Christians speak. These, however, use no unintelligible
and unheard-of language, but speak with the words and through the power of reason. The wonderful
arrangement, carried out by the Logos himself, through which he ennobled the human race by
restoring its consciousness of its own nobility, compels no one henceforth to regard the reasonable
as the unreasonable or wisdom as folly. But is the Christian wisdom not of divine origin? How
can it in that case be natural, and what connection can exist between it and the wisdom of
the Greeks? Justin bestowed the closest attention on this question, but he never for a moment
doubted what the answer must be. Wherever the reasonable has revealed itself, it has always
been through the operation of the divine reason. For man's lofty endowment consists in his
having had a portion of the divine reason implanted within him, and in his consequent capacity
of attaining a knowledge of divine things, though not a perfect and clear one, by dint of persistent
efforts after truth and virtue. When man remembers his real nature and destination, that is,
when he comes to himself, the divine reason is already revealing itself in him and through
him. As man's possession conferred on him at the creation, it is at once his most peculiar
property, and the power which dominates and determines his nature.[362] All that is reasonable
is based on revelation. In order to accomplish his true destiny man requires from the beginning
the inward working of that divine reason which has created the world for the sake of man, and
therefore wishes to raise man beyond the world to God.[363]

Apparently no one could speak in a more stoical fashion. But this train of thought is supplemented
by something which limits it. Revelation does retain its peculiar and unique significance.
For no one who merely possessed the "seed of the Logos" ([Greek: sperma tou logou]), though
it may have been his exclusive guide to knowledge and conduct, was ever able to grasp the whole
truth and impart it in a convincing manner. Though Socrates and Heraclitus may in a way be
called Christians, they cannot be so designated in any real sense. Reason is clogged with unreasonableness,
and the certainty of truth is doubtful wherever the whole Logos has not been acting; for man's
natural endowment with reason is too weak to oppose the powers of evil and of sense that work
in the world, namely, the demons. We must therefore believe in the prophets in whom the whole
Logos spoke. He who does that must also of necessity believe in Christ; for the prophets clearly
pointed to him as the perfect embodiment of the Logos. Measured by the fulness, clearness,
and certainty of the knowledge imparted by the Logos Christ, all knowledge independent of him
appears as merely human wisdom, even when it emanates from the seed of the Logos. The Stoic
argument is consequently untenable. Men blind and kept in bondage by the demons require to
be aided by a special revelation. It is true that this revelation is nothing new, and in so
far as it has always existed, and never varied in character, from the beginning of the world,
it is in this sense nothing extraordinary. It is the divine help granted to man, who has fallen
under the power of the demons, and enabling him to follow his reason and freedom to do what
is good. By the appearance of Christ this help became accessible to all men. The dominion of
demons and revelation are the two correlated ideas. If the former did not exist, the latter
would not be necessary. According as we form a lower or higher estimate of the pernicious results
of that sovereignty, the value of revelation rises or sinks. This revelation cannot do less
than give the necessary assurance of the truth, and it cannot do more than impart the power
that develops and matures the inalienable natural endowment of man and frees him from the dominion
of the demons.

Accordingly the teaching of the prophets and Christ is related even to the very highest human
philosophy as the whole is to the part,[364] or as the certain is to the uncertain; and hence
also as the permanent is to the transient. For the final stage has now arrived and Christianity
is destined to put an end to natural human philosophy. When the perfect work is there, the
fragmentary must cease. Justin gave the clearest expression to this conviction. Christianity,
i.e., the prophetic teaching attested by Christ and accessible to all, puts an end to the human
systems of philosophy that from their close affinity to it may be called Christian, inasmuch
as it effects all and more than all that these systems have done, and inasmuch as the speculations
of the philosophers, which are uncertain and mingled with error, are transformed by it into
dogmas of indubitable certainty.[365] The practical conclusion drawn in Justin's treatise from
this exposition is that the Christians are at least entitled to ask the authorities to treat
them as philosophers (Apol. I. 7, 20: II. 15). This demand, he says, is the more justifiable
because the freedom of philosophers is enjoyed even by such people as merely bear the name,
whereas in reality they set forth immoral and pernicious doctrines.[366]

In the dialogue with the Jew Trypho, which is likewise meant for heathen readers, Justin ceased
to employ the idea of the existence of a "seed of the Logos implanted by nature" ([Greek: sperma
logou emphuton]) in every man. From this fact we recognise that he did not consider the notion
of fundamental importance. He indeed calls the Christian religion a philosophy;[367] but, in
so far as this is the case, it is "the only sure and saving philosophy." No doubt the so-called
philosophies put the right questions, but they are incapable of giving correct answers. For
the Deity, who embraces all true being, and a knowledge of whom alone makes salvation possible,
is only known in proportion as he reveals himself. True wisdom is therefore exclusively based
on revelation. Hence it is opposed to every human philosophy, because revelation was only given
in the prophets and in Christ.[368] The Christian is the philosopher,[369] because the followers
of Plato and the Stoics are virtually no philosophers. In applying the title "philosophy" to
Christianity he therefore does not mean to bring Christians and philosophers more closely together.
No doubt, however, he asserts that the Christian doctrine, which is founded on the knowledge
of Christ and leads to blessedness,[370] is in accordance with reason.

Athenagoras. The petition on behalf of Christians, which Athenagoras, "the Christian philosopher
of Athens," presented, to the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, nowhere expressly designates
Christianity as a philosophy, and still less does it style the Christians philosophers.[371]
But, at the very beginning of his writing Athenagoras also claims for the Christian doctrines
the toleration granted by the state to all philosophic tenets.[372] In support of his claim
he argues that the state punishes nothing but practical atheism,[373] and that the "atheism"
of the Christians is a doctrine about God such as had been propounded by the most distinguished
philosophers--Pythagoreans, Platonists, Peripatetics, and Stoics--who, moreover, were permitted
to write whatsoever they pleased on the subject of the "Deity."[374] The Apologist concedes
even more: "If philosophers did not also acknowledge the existence of one God, if they did
not also conceive the gods in question to be partly demons, partly matter, partly of human
birth, then certainly we would be justly expelled as aliens."[375] He therefore takes up the
standpoint that the state is justified in refusing to tolerate people with completely new doctrines.
When we add that he everywhere assumes that the wisdom and piety of the emperors are sufficient
to test and approve[376] the truth of the Christian teaching, that he merely represents this
faith itself as the reasonable doctrine,[377] and that, with the exception of the resurrection
of the body, he leaves all the positive and objectionable tenets of Christianity out of account,[378]
there is ground for thinking that this Apologist differs essentially from Justin in his conception
of the relation of Christianity to secular philosophy.

Moreover, it is not to be denied that Athenagoras views the revelation in the prophets and
in Christ as completely identical. The philosophers, he says, were incapable of knowing the
full truth, since it was not from God, but rather from themselves, that they wished to learn
about God. True wisdom, however, can only be learned from God, that is, from his prophets;
it depends solely on revelation.[379] Here also then we have a repetition of the thought that
the truly reasonable is of supernatural origin. Such is the importance attached by Athenagoras
to this proposition, that he declares any demonstration of the "reasonable" to be insufficient,
no matter how luminous it may appear. Even that which is most evidently true--e.g., monotheism--is
not raised from the domain of mere human opinion into the sphere of undoubted certainty till
it can be confirmed by revelation.[380] This can be done by Christians alone. Hence they are
very different from the philosophers, just as they are also distinguished from these by their
manner of life.[381] All the praises which Athenagoras from time to time bestows on philosophers,
particularly Plato,[382] are consequently to be understood in a merely relative sense. Their
ultimate object is only to establish the claim made by the Apologist with regard to the treatment
of Christians by the state; but they are not really meant to bring the former into closer relationship
to philosophers. Athenagoras also holds the theory that Christians are philosophers, in so
far as the "philosophers" are not such in any true sense. It is only the problems they set
that connect the two. He exhibits less clearness than Justin in tracing the necessity of revelation
to the fact that the demon sovereignty, which, above all, reveals itself in polytheism,[383]
can only be overthrown by revelation; he rather emphasises the other thought (cc. 7, 9) that
the necessary attestation of the truth can only be given in this way.[384]

Tatian's[385] chief aim was not to bring about a juster treatment of the Christians.[386] He
wished to represent their cause as the good contrasted with the bad, wisdom as opposed to error,
truth in contradistinction to outward seeming, hypocrisy, and pretentious emptiness. His "Address
to the Greeks" begins with a violent polemic against all Greek philosophers. Tatian merely
acted up to a judgment of philosophers and philosophy which in Justin's case is still concealed.[387]
Hence it was not possible for him to think of demonstrating analogies between Christians and
philosophers. He also no doubt views Christianity as "reasonable;" he who lives virtuously
and follows wisdom receives it;[388] but yet it is too sublime to be grasped by earthly perception.[389]
It is a heavenly thing which depends on the communication of the "Spirit," and hence can only
be known by revelation.[390] But yet it is a "philosophy" with definite doctrines ([Greek:
dogmata]);[391] it brings nothing new, but only such blessings as we have already received,
but could not retain[392] owing to the power of error, i.e., the dominion of the demons.[393]
Christianity is therefore the philosophy in which, by virtue of the Logos revelation through
the prophets,[394] the rational knowledge that leads to life[395] is restored. This knowledge
was no less obscured among the Greek philosophers than among the Greeks generally. In so far
as revelation took place among the barbarians from the remotest antiquity, Christianity may
also be called the barbarian philosophy.[396] Its truth is proved by its ancient date[397]
as well as by its intelligible form, which enables even the most uneducated person that is
initiated in it[398] to understand it perfectly.[399] Finally, Tatian also states (c. 40) that
the Greek sophists have read the writings of Moses and the prophets, and reproduced them in
a distorted form. He therefore maintains the very opposite of what Celsus took upon him to
demonstrate when venturing to derive certain sayings and doctrines of Christ and the Christians
from the philosophers. Both credit the plagiarists with intentional misrepresentation or gross
misunderstanding. Justin judged more charitably. To Tatian, on the contrary, the mythology
of the Greeks did not appear worse than their philosophy; in both cases he saw imitations and
intentional corruption of the truth.[400]

Theophilus agrees with Tatian, in so far as he everywhere appears to contrast Christianity
with philosophy. The religious and moral culture of the Greeks is derived from their poets
(historians) and philosophers (ad Autol. II. 3 fin. and elsewhere). However, not only do poets
and philosophers contradict each other (II. 5); but the latter also do not agree (II. 4. 8:
III. 7), nay, many contradict themselves (III. 3). Not a single one of the so-called philosophers,
however, is to be taken seriously;[401] they have devised myths and follies (II. 8); everything
they have set forth is useless and godless (III. 2); vain and worthless fame was their aim
(III. 3). But God knew beforehand the "drivellings of these hollow philosophers" and made his
preparations (II. 15). He of old proclaimed the truth by the mouth of prophets, and these deposited
it in holy writings. This truth refers to the knowledge of God, the origin and history of the
world, as well as to a virtuous life. The prophetic testimony in regard to it was continued
in the Gospel.[402] Revelation, however, is necessary because this wisdom of the philosophers
and poets is really demon wisdom, for they were inspired by devils.[403] Thus the most extreme
contrasts appear to exist here. Still, Theophilus is constrained to confess that truth was
not only announced by the Sibyl, to whom his remarks do not apply, for she is (II. 36): [Greek:
en Ellêsin kai en tois loipois ethnetin genomenê prophêtis], but that poets and philosophers,
"though against their will," also gave clear utterances regarding the justice, the judgment,
and the punishments of God, as well as regarding his providence in respect to the living and
the dead, or, in other words, about the most important points (II. 37, 38, 8 fin.). Theophilus
gives a double explanation of this fact. On the one hand he ascribes it to the imitation of
holy writings (II. 12, 37: I. 14), and on the other he admits that those writers, when the
demons abandoned them ([Greek: tê psychê eknêpsantes ex autôn]), of themselves displayed a
knowledge of the divine sovereignty, the judgment etc., which agrees with the teachings of
the prophets (II. 8). This admission need not cause astonishment; for the freedom and control
of his own destiny with which man is endowed (II. 27) must infallibly lead him to correct knowledge
and obedience to God, as soon as he is no longer under the sway of the demons. Theophilus did
not apply the title of philosophy to Christian truth, this title being in his view discredited;
but Christianity is to him the "wisdom of God," which by luminous proofs convinces the men
who reflect on their own nature.[404]

Tertullian and Minucius Felix.[405] Whilst, in the case of the Greek Apologists, the acknowledgment
of revelation appears conditioned by philosophical scepticism on the one hand, and by the strong
impression of the dominion of the demons on the other, the sceptical element is not only wanting
in the Latin Apologists, but the Christian truth is even placed in direct opposition to the
sceptical philosophy and on the side of philosophical dogmatism, i.e., Stoicism.[406] Nevertheless
the observations of Tertullian and Minucius Felix with regard to the essence of Christianity,
viewed as philosophy and as revelation, are at bottom completely identical with the conception
of the Greek Apologists, although it is undeniable that in the former case the revealed character
of Christianity is placed in the background.[407] The recognition of this fact is exceedingly
instructive, for it proves that the conception of Christianity set forth by the Apologists
was not an individual one, but the necessary expression of the conviction that Christian truth
contains the completion and guarantee of philosophical knowledge. To Minucius Felix (and Tertullian)
Christian truth chiefly presents itself as the wisdom implanted by nature in every man (Oct.
16. 5). In so far as man possesses reason and speech and accomplishes the task of the "examination
of the universe" ("inquisitio universitatis"), conditioned by this gift, he has the Christian
truth, that is, he finds Christianity in his own constitution, and in the rational order of
the world. Accordingly, Minucius is also able to demonstrate the Christian doctrines by means
of the Stoic principle of knowledge, and arrives at the conclusion that Christianity is a philosophy,
i.e., the true philosophy, and that philosophers are to be considered Christians in proportion
as they have discovered the truth.[408] Moreover, as he represented Christian ethics to be
the expression of the Stoic, and depicted the Christian bond of brotherhood as a cosmopolitan
union of philosophers, who have become conscious of their natural similarity,[409] the revealed
character of Christianity appears to be entirely given up. This religion is natural enlightenment,
the revelation of a truth contained in the world and in man, the discovery of the one God from
the open book of creation. The difference between him and an Apologist like Tatian seems here
to be a radical one. But, if we look more closely, we find that Minucius--and not less Tertullian--has
abandoned Stoic rationalism in vital points. We may regard his apologetic aim as his excuse
for clearly drawing the logical conclusions from these inconsistencies himself. However, these
deviations of his from the doctrines of the Stoa are not merely prompted by Christianity, but
rather have already become an essential component of his philosophical theory of the world.
In the first place, Minucius developed a detailed theory of the pernicious activity of the
demons (cc. 26, 27). This was a confession that human nature was not what it ought to be, because
an evil element had penetrated it from without. Secondly, he no doubt acknowledged (I. 4: 16.
5) the natural light of wisdom in humanity, but nevertheless remarked (32. 9) that our thoughts
are darkness when measured by the clearness of God. Finally, and this is the most essential
point, after appealing to various philosophers when expounding his doctrine of the final conflagration
of the world, he suddenly repudiated this tribunal, declaring that the Christians follow the
prophets, and that philosophers "have formed this shadowy picture of distorted truth in imitation
of the divine predictions of the prophets." (34) Here we have now a union of all the elements
already found in the Greek Apologists; only they are, as it were, hid in the case of Minucius.
But the final proof that he agreed with them in the main is found in the exceedingly contemptuous
judgment which he in conclusion passed on all philosophers and indeed on philosophy generally.[410]
(34. 5: 38. 5) This judgment is not to be explained, as in Tertullian's case, by the fact that
his Stoic opinions led him to oppose natural perception to all philosophical theory--for this,
at most, cannot have been more than a secondary contributing cause,[411] but by the fact that
he is conscious of following revealed wisdom.[412] Revelation is necessary because mankind
must be aided from without, i.e., by God. In this idea man's need of redemption is acknowledged,
though not to the same extent as by Seneca and Epictetus. But no sooner does Minucius perceive
the teachings of the prophets to be divine truth than man's natural endowment and the speculation
of philosophers sink for him into darkness. Christianity is the wisdom which philosophers sought,
but were not able to find.[413]

We may sum up the doctrines of the Apologists as follows: (1) Christianity is revelation, i.e.,
it is the divine wisdom, proclaimed of old by the prophets and, by reason of its origin, possessing
an absolute certainty which can also be recognised in the fulfilment of their predictions.
As divine wisdom Christianity is contrasted with, and puts an end to, all natural and philosophical
knowledge. (2) Christianity is the enlightenment corresponding to the natural but impaired
knowledge of man.[414] It embraces all the elements of truth in philosophy, whence it is the
philosophy; and helps man to realise the knowledge with which he is naturally endowed. (3)
Revelation of the rational was and is necessary, because man has fallen under the sway of the
demons. (4) The efforts of philosophers to ascertain the right knowledge were in vain; and
this is, above all, shown by the fact that they neither overthrew polytheism nor brought about
a really moral life. Moreover, so far as they discovered the truth, they owed it to the prophets
from whom they borrowed it; at least it is uncertain whether they even attained a knowledge
of fragments of the truth by their own independent efforts.[415] But it is certain that many
seeming truths in the writings of the philosophers were imitations of the truth by evil demons.
This is the origin of all polytheism, which is, moreover, to some extent an imitation of Christian
institutions. (5) The confession of Christ is simply included in the acknowledgment of the
wisdom of the prophets; the doctrine of the truth did not receive a new content through Christ;
he only made it accessible to the world and strengthened it (victory over the demons; special
features acknowledged by Justin and Tertullian). (6) The practical test of Christianity is
first contained in the fact that all persons are able to grasp it, for women and uneducated
men here become veritable sages; secondly in the fact that it has the power of producing a
holy life, and of overthrowing the tyranny of the demons. In the Apologists, therefore, Christianity
served itself heir to antiquity, i.e., to the result of the monotheistic knowledge and ethics
of the Greeks: "[Greek: Osa oun para pasikalôs eirêtai, hêmôn tôn Christianôn esti]" (Justin,
Apol. II. 13). It traced its origin back to the beginning of the world. Everything true and
good which elevates mankind springs from divine revelation, and is at the same time genuinely
human, because it is a clear expression of what man finds within him and of his destination
(Justin, Apol. I. 46: [Greek: hoi meta logou biôsantes Christianoi eisi, kan atheoi enomisthêsan,
oion en Hellêsi men Sôkratês kai Êrakleitos kai oi omoioi autois, en barbarois de Abraam k.t.l.],
"those that have lived with reason are Christians, even though they were accounted atheists,
such as Socrates and Heraclitus and those similar to them among the Greeks, and Abraham etc.
among the barbarians"). But everything true and good is Christian, for Christianity is nothing
else than the teaching of revelation. No second formula can be imagined in which the claim
of Christianity to be the religion of the world is so powerfully expressed (hence also the
endeavour of the Apologists to reconcile Christianity and the Empire), nor, on the other hand,
can we conceive of one where the specific content of traditional Christianity is so thoroughly
neutralised as it is here. But the really epoch-making feature is the fact that the intellectual
culture of mankind now appears reconciled and united with religion. The "dogmas" are the expression
of this. Finally, these fundamental presuppositions also result in a quite definite idea of
the essence of revelation and of the content of reason. The essence of revelation consists
in its form: it is divine communication through a miraculous inward working. All the media
of revelation are passive organs of the Holy Spirit (Athenag. Supplic. 7; Pseudo-Justin, Cohort.
8; Justin, Dialogue 115. 7; Apol. I. 31, 33, 36; etc.; see also Hippolytus, de Christo et Antichr.
2). These were not necessarily at all times in a state of ecstasy, when they received the revelations;
but they were no doubt in a condition of absolute receptivity. The Apologists had no other
idea of revelation. What they therefore viewed as the really decisive proof of the reality
of revelation is the prediction of the future, for the human mind does not possess this power.
It was only in connection with this proof that the Apologists considered it important to show
what Moses, David, Isaiah, etc., had proclaimed in the Old Testament, that is, these names
have only a chronological significance. This also explains their interest in a history of the
world, in so far as this interest originated in the effort to trace the chain of prophets up
to the beginning of history, and to prove the higher antiquity of revealed truth as compared
with all human knowledge and errors, particularly as found among the Greeks (clear traces in
Justin,[416] first detailed argument in Tatian).[417] If, however, strictly speaking, it is
only the form and not the content of revelation that is supernatural in so far as this content
coincides with that of reason, it is evident that the Apologists simply took the content of
the latter for granted and stated it dogmatically. So, whether they expressed themselves in
strictly Stoic fashion or not, they all essentially agree in the assumption that true religion
and morality are the natural content of reason. Even Tatian forms no exception, though he himself
protests against the idea.

3. The doctrines of Christianity as the revealed and rational religion.

The Apologists frequently spoke of the doctrines or "dogmas" of Christianity; and the whole
content of this religion as philosophy is included in these dogmas.[418] According to what
we have already set forth there can be no doubt about the character of Christian dogmas. They
are the rational truths, revealed by the prophets in the Holy Scriptures, and summarised in
Christ ([Greek: christos logos kai nomos]), which in their unity represent the divine wisdom,
and the recognition of which leads to virtue and eternal life. The Apologists considered it
their chief task to set forth these doctrines, and hence they can be reproduced with all desirable
clearness. The dogmatic scheme of the Apologists may therefore be divided into three component
parts. These are: (A) Christianity viewed as monotheistic cosmology (God as the Father of the
world); (B) Christianity as the highest morality and righteousness (God as the judge who rewards
goodness and punishes wickedness); (C) Christianity regarded as redemption (God as the Good
One who assists man and rescues him from the power of the demons).[419] Whilst the first two
ideas are expressed in a clear and precise manner, it is equally true that the third is not
worked out in a lucid fashion. This, as will afterwards be seen, is, on the one hand, the result
of the Apologists' doctrine of freedom, and, on the other, of their inability to discover a
specific significance for the person of Christ within the sphere of revelation. Both facts
again are ultimately to be explained from their moralism.

The essential content of revealed philosophy is viewed by the Apologists (see A, B) as comprised
in three doctrines.[420] First, there is one spiritual and inexpressibly exalted God, who is
Lord and Father of the world. Secondly, he requires a holy life. Thirdly, he will at last sit
in judgment, and will reward the good with immortality and punish the wicked with death. The
teaching concerning God, virtue, and eternal reward is traced to the prophets and Christ; but
the bringing about of a virtuous life (of righteousness) has been necessarily left by God to
men themselves; for God has created man free, and virtue can only be acquired by man's own
efforts. The prophets and Christ are therefore a source of righteousness in so far as they
are teachers. But as God, that is, the divine Word (which we need not here discuss) has spoken
in them, Christianity is to be defined as the Knowledge of God, mediated by the Deity himself,
and as a virtuous walk in the longing after eternal and perfect life with God, as well as in
the sure hope of this imperishable reward. By knowing what is true and doing what is good man
becomes righteous and a partaker of the highest bliss. This knowledge, which has the character
of divine instruction,[421] rests on faith in the divine revelation. This revelation has the
nature and power of redemption in so far as the fact is undoubted that without it men cannot
free themselves from the tyranny of the demons, whilst believers in revelation are enabled
by the Spirit of God to put them to flight. Accordingly, the dogmas of Christian philosophy
theoretically contain the monotheistic cosmology, and practically the rules for a holy life,
which appears as a renunciation of the world and as a new order of society.[422] The goal is
immortal life, which consists in the full knowledge and contemplation of God. The dogmas of
revelation lie between the cosmology and ethics; they are indefinitely expressed so far as
they contain the idea of salvation; but they are very precisely worded in so far as they guarantee
the truth of the cosmology and ethics.

1. The dogmas which express the knowledge of God and the world are dominated by the fundamental
idea that the world as the created, conditioned, and transient is contrasted with something
self-existing, unchangeable and eternal, which is the first cause of the world. This self-existing
Being has none of the attributes which belong to the world; hence he is exalted above every
name and has in himself no distinctions. This implies, first, the unity and uniqueness of this
eternal Being; secondly, his spiritual nature, for everything bodily is subject to change;
and, finally, his perfection, for the self-existent and eternal requires nothing. Since, however,
he is the cause of all being, himself being unconditioned, he is the fulness of all being or
true being itself (Tatian 5: [Greek: katho pasa dunamis oratôn te kai aoratôn autos hupostasis
ên, sun autô ta panta]). As the living and spiritual Being he reveals himself in free creations,
which make known his omnipotence and wisdom, i.e., his operative reason. These creations are,
moreover, a proof of the goodness of the Deity, for they can be no result of necessities, in
so far as God is in himself perfect. Just because he is perfect, the Eternal Essence is also
the Father of all virtues, in so far as he contains no admixture of what is defective. These
virtues include both the goodness which manifests itself in his creations, and the righteousness
which gives to the creature what belongs to him, in accordance with the position he has received.
On the basis of this train of thought the Apologists lay down the dogmas of the monarchy of
God ([Greek: tôn holôn to monarchikon]), his supramundaneness ([Greek: to arrêton, to anekphraston,
to achôrêton, to akatalêpton, to aperinoêton, to asugkriton, to asymbibaston, to anekdiêgêton];
see Justin, Apol. II. 6; Theoph. I. 3); his unity ([Greek: eis Theos]); his having no beginning
([Greek: anarchos, hoti agenêtos]); his eternity and unchangeableness ([Greek: analloiôtos
kathoti athanatos]); his perfection ([Greek: teleios]); his need of nothing ([Greek: aprosdeês]);
his spiritual nature ([Greek: pneuma ho Theos]); his absolute causality ([Greek: autos hyparchôn
tou pantos hê hypostasis], the motionless mover, see Aristides c. 1); his creative activity
([Greek: ktistês tôn pantôn]); his sovereignty ([Greek: despotês tôn holôn]); his fatherhood
([Greek: patêr dia to einai auton pro tôn holôn]) his reason-power (God as [Greek: logos, nous,
pneuma, sophia]); his omnipotence ([Greek: pantokratôr hoti autos ta panta kratei kai emperiechei]);
his righteousness and goodness ([Greek: patêr tês dikaiosunês kai pasôn tôn aretôn chrêstotês]).
These dogmas are set forth by one Apologist in a more detailed, and by another in a more concise
form, but three points are emphasised by all. First, God is primarily to be conceived as the
First Cause. Secondly, the principle of moral good is also the principle of the world. Thirdly,
the principle of the world, that is, the Deity, as being the immortal and eternal, forms the
contrast to the world which is the transient. In the cosmology of the Apologists the two fundamental
ideas are that God is the Father and Creator of the world, but that, as uncreated and eternal,
he is also the complete contrast to it.[423]

These dogmas about God were not determined by the Apologists from the standpoint of the Christian
Church which is awaiting an introduction into the Kingdom of God; but were deduced from a contemplation
of the world on the one hand (see particularly Tatian, 4; Theophilus, I. 5, 6), and of the
moral nature of man on the other. But, in so far as the latter itself belongs to the sphere
of created things, the cosmos is the starting-point of their speculations. This is everywhere
dominated by reason and order;[424] it bears the impress of the divine Logos, and that in a
double sense. On the one hand it appears as the copy of a higher, eternal world, for if we
imagine transient and changeable matter removed, it is a wonderful complex of spiritual forces;
on the other it presents itself as the finite product of a rational will. Moreover, the matter
which lies at its basis is nothing bad, but an indifferent substance created by God,[425] though
indeed perishable. In its constitution the world is in every respect a structure worthy of
God.[426] Nevertheless, according to the Apologists, the direct author of the world was not
God, but the personified power of reason which they perceived in the cosmos and represented
as the immediate source of the universe. The motive for this dogma and the interest in it would
be wrongly determined by alleging that the Apologists purposely introduced the Logos in order
to separate God from matter, because they regarded this as something bad. This idea of Philo's
cannot at least have been adopted by them as the result of conscious reflection, for it does
not agree with their conception of matter; nor is it compatible with their idea of God and
their belief in Providence, which is everywhere firmly maintained. Still less indeed can it
be shown that they were all impelled to this dogma from their view of Jesus Christ, since in
this connection, with the exception of Justin and Tertullian, they manifested no specific interest
in the incarnation of the Logos in Jesus. The adoption of the dogma of the Logos is rather
to be explained thus: (1) The idea of God, derived by abstraction from the cosmos, did indeed,
like that of the idealistic philosophy, involve the element of unity and spirituality, which
implied a sort of personality; but the fulness of all spiritual forces, the essence of everything
imperishable were quite as essential features of the conception; for in spite of the transcendence
inseparable from the notion of God, this idea was nevertheless meant to explain the world.[427]
Accordingly, they required a formula capable of expressing the transcendent and unchangeable
nature of God on the one hand, and his fulness of creative and spiritual powers on the other.
But the latter attributes themselves had again to be comprehended in a unity, because the law
of the cosmos bore the appearance of a harmonious one. From this arose the idea of the Logos,
and indeed the latter was necessarily distinguished from God as a separate existence, as soon
as the realisation of the powers residing in God was represented as beginning. The Logos is
the hypostasis of the operative power of reason, which at once preserves the unity and unchangeableness
of God in spite of the exercise of the powers residing in him, and renders this very exercise
possible. (2) Though the Apologists believed in the divine origin of the revelation given to
the prophets, on which all knowledge of truth is based, they could nevertheless not be induced
by this idea to represent God himself as a direct actor. For that revelation presupposes a
speaker and a spoken word; but it would be an impossible thought to make the fulness of all
essence and the first cause of all things speak. The Deity cannot be a speaking and still less
a visible person, yet according to the testimony of the prophets, a Divine Person was seen
by them. The Divine Being who makes himself known on earth in audible and visible fashion can
only be the Divine Word. As, however, according to the fundamental view of the Apologists the
principle of religion, i.e., of the knowledge of the truth, is also the principle of the world,
so that Divine Word, which imparts the right knowledge of the world, must be identical with
the Divine Reason which produced the world itself. In other words, the Logos is not only the
creative Reason of God, but also his revealing Word. This explains the motive and aim of the
dogma of the Logos. We need not specially point out that nothing more than the precision and
certainty of the Apologists' manner of statement is peculiar here; the train of thought itself
belongs to Greek philosophy. But that very confidence is the most essential feature of the
case; for in fact the firm belief that the principle of the world is also that of revelation
represents an important early-Christian idea, though indeed in the form of philosophical reflection.
To the majority of the Apologists the theoretical content of the Christian faith is completely
exhausted in this proposition. They required no particular Christology, for in every revelation
of God by his Word they already recognised a proof of his existence not to be surpassed, and
consequently regarded it as Christianity in nuce.[428] But the fact that the Apologists made
a distinction in thesi between the prophetic Spirit of God and the Logos, without being able
to make any use of this distinction, is a very clear instance of their dependence on the formulæ
of the Church's faith. Indeed their conception of the Logos continually compelled them to identify
the Logos and the Spirit, just as they not unfrequently define Christianity as the belief in
the true God and in his Son, without mentioning the Spirit.[429] Further their dependence on
the Christian tradition is shown in the fact that the most of them expressly designated the
Logos as the Son of God.[430]

The Logos doctrine of the Apologists is an essentially unanimous one. Since God cannot be conceived
as without reason, [Greek: alogos], but as the fulness of all reason,[431] he has always Logos
in himself. This Logos is on the one hand the divine consciousness itself, and on the other
the power (idea and energy) to which the world is due; he is not separate from God, but is
contained in his essence.[432] For the sake of the creation God produced (sent forth, projected)
the Logos from himself, that is, he engendered[433] him from his essence by a free and simple
act of will ([Greek: Theos ek Theou pephukôs ex heautou]. Dial. 61). Then for the first time
the Logos became a hypostasis separate from God, or, in other words, he first came into existence;
and, in virtue of his origin, he possesses the following distinctive features:[434] (1) The
inner essence of the Logos is identical with the essence of God himself; for it is the product
of self-separation in God, willed and brought about by himself. Further, the Logos is not cut
off and separated from God, nor is he a mere modality in him. He is rather the independent
product of the self-unfolding of God ([Greek: oikonomia]), which product, though it is the
epitome of divine reason, has nevertheless not stripped the Father of this attribute. The Logos
is the revelation of God, and the visible God. Consequently the Logos is really God and Lord,
i.e., he possesses the divine nature in virtue of his essence. The Apologists, however, only
know of one kind of divine nature and this is that which belongs to the Logos. (2) From the
moment when he was begotten the Logos is a being distinct from the Father; he is [Greek: arithmô
eteron ti, Theos heteros, Theos deuteros] ("something different in number, another God, a second
God.") But his personality only dates from that moment. "Fuit tempus, cum patri filius non
fuit," ("there was a time when the Father had no Son," so Tertullian, adv. Hermog. 3). The
[Greek: logos prophorikos] is for the first time a hypostasis distinct from the Father, the
[Greek: logos endiathetos] is not.[435] (3) The Logos has an origin, the Father has not; hence
it follows that in relation to God the Logos is a creature; he is the begotten, that is, the
created God, the God who has a beginning. Wherefore in rank he is below God ([Greek: en deutera
chôra]--[Greek: deuteros Theos], "in the second place, and a second God"), the messenger and
servant of God. The subordination of the Logos is not founded on the content of his essence,
but on his origin. In relation to the creatures, however, the Logos is the [Greek: archê],
i.e., not only the beginning but the principle of the vitality and form of everything that
is to receive being. As an emanation (the begotten) he is distinguished from all creatures,
for he alone is the Son;[436] but, as having a beginning, he again stands on a level with them.
Hence the paradoxical expression, [Greek: ergon prôtotokon tou patros] ("first begotten work
of the Father"), is here the most appropriate designation. (4) In virtue of his finite origin,
it is possible and proper for the Logos to enter into the finite, to act, to speak, and to
appear. As he arose for the sake of the creation of the world, he has the capacity of personal
and direct revelation which does not belong to the infinite God; nay, his whole essence consists
in the very fact that he is thought, word, and deed. Behind this active substitute and vicegerent,
the Father stands in the darkness of the incomprehensible, and in the incomprehensible light
of perfection as the hidden, unchangeable God.[437]

With the issuing forth of the Logos from God began the realisation of the idea of the world.
The world as [Greek: kosmos noêtos] is contained in the Logos. But the world is material and
manifold, the Logos is spiritual and one. Therefore the Logos is not himself the world, but
he is its creator and in a certain fashion its archetype. Justin and Tatian used the expression
"beget" [Greek: gennan] for the creation of the world, but in connections which do not admit
of any importance being attached to this use. The world was created out of nothing after a
host of spirits, as is assumed by most Apologists, had been created along with heaven, which
is a higher, glorious world. The purpose of the creation of the world was and is the production
of men, i.e., beings possessed of soul and body, endowed with reason and freedom, and therefore
made in the image of God; beings who are to partake of the blessedness and perfection of God.
Everything is created for man's sake, and his own creation is a proof of the goodness of God.
As beings possessed of soul and body, men are neither mortal nor immortal, but capable either
of death or immortality.[438] The condition on which men can attain the latter introduces us
to ethics. The doctrines, that God is also the absolute Lord of matter; that evil cannot be
a quality of matter, but rather arose in time and from the free decision of the spirits or
angels; and finally that the world will have an end, but God can call the destroyed material
into existence, just as he once created it out of nothing, appear in principle to reconcile
the dualism in the cosmology. We have the less occasion to give the details here, because they
are known from the philosophical systems of the period, especially Philo's, and vary in manifold
ways. All the Apologists, however, are imbued with the idea that this knowledge of God and
the world, the genesis of the Logos and cosmos, are the most essential part of Christianity
itself.[439] This conception is really not peculiar to the Apologists: in the second century
the great majority of Christians, in so far as they reflected at all, regarded the monotheistic
explanation of the world as a main part of the Christian religion. The theoretical view of
the world as a harmonious whole, of its order, regularity and beauty; the certainty that all
this had been called into existence by an Almighty Spirit; the sure hope that heaven and earth
will pass away, but will give place to a still more glorious structure, were always present,
and put an end to the bright and gorgeously coloured, but phantastic and vague, cosmogonies
and theogonies of antiquity.

2. Their clear system of morality is in keeping with their relatively simple cosmology. In
giving man reason and freedom as an inalienable possession God destined him for incorruptibility
([Greek: athanasia, aphtharsia]), by the attainment of which he was to become a being similar
to God.[440] To the gift of imperishability God, however, attached the condition of man's preserving
[Greek: ta tês athanasias] ("the things of immortality"), i.e., preserving the knowledge of
God and maintaining a holy walk in imitation of the divine perfection. This demand is as natural
as it is just; moreover, nobody can fulfil it in man's stead, for an essential feature of virtue
is its being free, independent action. Man must therefore determine himself to virtue by the
knowledge that he is only in this way obedient to the Father of the world and able to reckon
on the gift of immortality. The conception of the content of virtue, however, contains an element
which cannot be clearly apprehended from the cosmology; moral goodness consists in letting
oneself be influenced in no way by the sensuous, but in living solely, after the Spirit, and
imitating the perfection and purity of God. Moral badness is giving way to any affection resulting
from the natural basis of man. The Apologists undoubtedly believe that virtue consists negatively
in man's renunciation of what his natural constitution of soul and body demands or impels him
to. Some express this thought in a more pregnant and unvarnished fashion, others in a milder
way. Tatian, for instance, says that we must divest ourselves of the human nature within us;
but in truth the idea is the same in all. The moral law of nature of which the Apologists speak,
and which they find reproduced in the clearest and most beautiful way in the sayings of Jesus,[441]
calls upon man to raise himself above his nature and to enter into a corresponding union with
his fellow-man which is something higher than natural connections. It is not so much the law
of love that is to rule everything, for love itself is only a phase of a higher law; it is
the law governing the perfect and sublime Spirit, who, as being the most exalted existence
on this earth, is too noble for the world. Raised already in this knowledge beyond time and
space, beyond the partial and the finite, the man of God, even while upon the earth, is to
hasten to the Father of Light. By equanimity, absence of desires, purity, and goodness, which
are the necessary results of clear knowledge, he is to show that he has already risen above
the transient through gazing on the imperishable and through the enjoyment of knowledge, imperfect
though the latter still be. If thus, a suffering hero, he has stood the test on earth, if he
has become dead to the world,[442] he may be sure that in the life to come God will bestow
on him the gift of immortality, which includes the direct contemplation of God together with
the perfect knowledge that flows from it.[443] Conversely, the vicious man is given over to
eternal death, and in this punishment the righteousness of God is quite as plainly manifested,
as in the reward of everlasting life.

3. While it is certain that virtue is a matter of freedom, it is just as sure that no soul
is virtuous unless it follows the will of God, i.e., knows and judges of God and all things
as they must be known and judged of; and fulfils the commandments of God. This presupposes
a revelation of God through the Logos. A revelation of God, complete in itself and mediated
by the Logos, is found in the cosmos and in the constitution of man, he being created in his
Maker's image.[444] But experience has shown that this revelation is insufficient to enable
men to retain clear knowledge. They yielded to the seduction of evil demons, who, by God's
sufferance, took possession of the world, and availed themselves of man's sensuous side to
draw him away from the contemplation of the divine and lead him to the earthly.[445] The results
of this temptation appeared in the facts that humanity as a whole fell a prey to error, was
subjected to the bonds of the sensuous and of the demons, and therefore became doomed to death,
which is at once a punishment and the natural consequence of want of knowledge of God.[446]
Hence it required fresh efforts of the Logos to free men from a state which is indeed in no
instance an unavoidable necessity, though a sad fact in the case of almost all. For very few
are now able to recognise the one true God from the order of the universe and from the moral
law implanted in themselves; nor can they withstand the power of the demons ruling in the world
and use their freedom to imitate the virtues of God. Therefore the Almighty in his goodness
employed new means through the Logos to call men back from the error of their ways, to overthrow
the sovereignty of the demons upon earth, and to correct the disturbed course of the world
before the end has yet come. From the earliest times the Logos (the Spirit) has descended on
such men as preserved their souls pure, and bestowed on them, through inspiration, knowledge
of the truth (with reference to God, freedom, virtue, the demons, the origin of polytheism,
the judgment) to be imparted by them to others. These are his "prophets." Such men are rare
among the Greeks (and according to some not found at all), but numerous among the barbarians,
i.e., among the Jewish people. Taught by God, they announced the truth about him, and under
the promptings of the Logos they also committed the revelations to writings, which therefore,
as being inspired, are an authentic record of the whole truth.[447] To some of the most virtuous
among them he himself even appeared in human form and gave directions. He then is a Christian,
who receives and follows these prophetic teachings, that have ever been proclaimed afresh from
the beginning of the world down to the present time, and are summed up in the Old Testament.
Such a one is enabled even now to rescue his soul from the rule of the demons, and may confidently
expect the gift of immortality.

With the majority of the Apologists "Christianity" seems to be exhausted in these doctrines;
in fact, they do not even consider it necessary to mention ex professo the appearance of the
Logos in Christ (see above, p. 189 ff.). But, while it is certain that they all recognised
that the teachings of the prophets contained the full revelation of the truth, we would be
quite wrong in assuming that they view the appearance and history of Christ as of no significance.
In their presentations some of them no doubt contented themselves with setting forth the most
rational and simple elements, and therefore took almost no notice of the historical; but even
in their case certain indications show that they regarded the manifestation of the Logos in
Christ as of special moment.[448] For the prophetic utterances, as found from the beginning,
require an attestation, the prophetic teaching requires a guarantee, so that misguided humanity
may accept them and no longer take error for truth and truth for error. The strongest guarantee
imaginable is found in the fulfilment of prophecy. Since no man is able to foretell what is
to come, the prediction of the future accompanying a doctrine proves its divine origin. God,
in his extraordinary goodness, not only inspired the prophets, through the Logos, with the
doctrines of truth, but has from the beginning put numerous predictions in their mouth. These
predictions were detailed and manifold; the great majority of them referred to a more prolonged
appearance of the Logos in human form at the end of history, and to a future judgment. Now,
so long as the predictions had not yet come to pass, the teachings of the prophets were not
sufficiently impressive, for the only sure witness of the truth is its outward attestation.
In the history of Christ, however, the majority of these prophecies were fulfilled in the most
striking fashion, and this not only guarantees the fulfilment of the relatively small remainder
not yet come to pass (judgment, resurrection), but also settles beyond all doubt the truth
of the prophetic teachings about God, freedom, virtue, immortality, etc. In the scheme of fulfilment
and prophecy even the irrational becomes rational; for the fulfilment of a prediction is not
a proof of its divine origin unless it refers to something extraordinary. Any one can predict
regular occurrences which always take place. Accordingly, a part of what was predicted had
to be irrational. Every particular in the history of Christ has therefore a significance, not
as regards the future, but as regards the past. Here everything happened "that the word of
the prophet might be fulfilled." Because the prophet had said so, it had to happen. Christ's
destiny attests the ancient teachings of the prophets. Everything, however, depends on this
attestation, for it was no longer the full truth that was wanting, but a convincing proof that
the truth was a reality and not a fancy.[449] But prophecy testifies that Christ is the ambassador
of God, the Logos that has appeared in human form, and the Son of God. If the future destiny
of Jesus is recorded in the Old Testament down to the smallest particular, and the book at
the same time declares that this predicted One is the Son of God and will be crucified, then
the paying of divine honours to this crucified man, to whom all the features of prophecy apply,
is completely justified. The stage marked by Christ in the history of God's revelation, the
content of which is always the same, is therefore the highest and last, because in it the "truth
along with the proof" has appeared. This circumstance explains why the truth is so much more
impressive and convinces more men than formerly, especially since Christ has also made special
provision for the spread of the truth and is himself an unequalled exemplification of a virtuous
life, the principles of which have now become known in the whole world through the spread of
his precepts.

These statements exhaust the arguments in most of the Apologies; and they accordingly seem
neither to have contemplated a redemption by Christ in the stricter sense of the word, nor
to have assumed the unique nature of the appearance of the Logos in Jesus. Christ accomplished
salvation as a divine teacher, that is to say, his teaching brings about the [Greek: allagê]
and [Greek: epangôgê] of the human race, its restoration to its original destination. This
also seems to suffice as regards demon rule. Logically considered, the individual portions
of the history of Jesus (of the baptismal confession) have no direct significance in respect
to salvation. Hence the teachings of the Christians seem to fall into two groups having no
inward connection, i.e., the propositions treating of the rational knowledge of God, and the
predicted and fulfilled historical facts which prove those doctrines and the believing hopes
they include.

But Justin at least gave token of a manifest effort to combine the historical statements regarding
Christ with the philosophical and moral doctrines of salvation and to conceive Jesus as the
Redeemer.[450] Accordingly, if the Christian dogmatic of succeeding times is found in the connection
of philosophical theology with the baptismal confession, that is, in the "scientific theology
of facts," Justin is, in a certain fashion, the first framer of Church dogma, though no doubt
in a very tentative way. (1) He tried to distinguish between the appearance of the Logos in
pre-Christian times and in Christ; he emphasised the fact that the whole Logos appeared only
in Christ, and that the manner of this appearance has no counterpart in the past. (2) Justin
showed in the Dialogue that, independently of the theologoumenon of the Logos, he was firmly
convinced of the divinity of Christ on the ground of predictions and of the impression made
by his personality.[451] (3) In addition to the story of the exaltation of Christ, Justin also
emphasised other portions of his history, especially the death on the cross (together with
baptism and the Lord's Supper) and tried to give them a positive significance.[452] He adopted
the common Christian saying that the blood of Christ cleanses believers and men are healed
through his wounds; and he tried to give a mystic significance to the cross. (4) He accordingly
spoke of the forgiveness of sins through Christ and confessed that men are changed, through
the new birth in baptism, from children of necessity and ignorance into children of purpose
and understanding and forgiveness of sins.[453] Von Engelhardt has, however, quite rightly
noticed that these are mere words which have nothing at all corresponding to them in the general
system of thought, because Justin remains convinced that the knowledge of the true God, of
his will, and of his promises, or the certainty that God will always grant forgiveness to the
repentant and eternal life to the righteous, is sufficient to convert the man who is master
of himself. Owing to the fundamental conviction which is expressed in the formulæ, "perfect
philosophy," "divine teacher," "new law," "freedom," "repentance," "sinless life," "sure hope,"
"reward," "immortality," the ideas, "forgiveness of sins," "redemption," "reconciliation,"
"new birth," "faith" (in the Pauline sense) must remain words,[454] or be relegated to the
sphere of magic and mystery.[455] Nevertheless we must not on that account overlook the intention.
Justin tried to see the divine revelation not only in the sayings of the prophets, but in unique
fashion in the person of Christ, and to conceive Christ not only as the divine teacher, but
also as the "Lord and Redeemer." In two points he actually succeeded in this. By the resurrection
and exaltation of Jesus Justin proved that Christ, the divine teacher, is also the future judge
and bestower of reward. Christ himself is able to give what he has promised--a life after death
free from sufferings and sins, that is the first point. The other thing, however, which Justin
very strongly emphasised is that Jesus is even now reigning in heaven, and shows his future
visible sovereignty of the world by giving his own people the power to cast out and vanquish
the demons in and by his name. Even at the present time the latter are put to flight by believers
in Christ.[456] So the redemption is no mere future one; it is even now taking place, and the
revelation of the Logos in Jesus Christ is not merely intended to prove the doctrines of the
rational religion, but denotes a real redemption, that is, a new beginning, in so far as the
power of the demons on earth is overthrown through Christ and in his strength. Jesus Christ,
the teacher of the whole truth and of a new law, which is the rational, the oldest, and the
divine, the only being who has understood how to call men from all the different nations and
in all stages of culture into a union of holy life, the inspiring One, for whom his disciples
go to death, the mighty One, through whose name the demons are cast out, the risen One, who
will one day reward and punish as judge, must be identical with the Son of God, who is the
divine reason and the divine power. In this belief which accompanies the confession of the
one God, creator of heaven and earth, Justin finds the special content of Christianity, which
the later Apologists, with the probable exception of Melito, reproduced in a much more imperfect
and meagre form. One thing, however, Justin in all probability did not formulate with precision,
viz., the proposition that the special result of salvation, i.e., immortality, was involved
in the incarnation of the Logos, in so far as that act brought about a real secret transformation
of the whole mortal nature of man. With Justin, indeed, as with the other Apologists, the "salvation"
([Greek: sôtêria]) consists essentially in the apportioning of eternal life to the world, which
has been created mortal and in consequence of sin has fallen a prey to the natural destiny
of "death;" and Christ is regarded as the bestower of incorruptibility who thus brings the
creation to its goal; but as a rule Justin does not go beyond this thought. Yet we certainly
find hints pointing to the notion of a physical and magical redemption accomplished at the
moment of the incarnation. See particularly the fragment in Irenæus (already quoted on page
220), which may be thus interpreted, and Apol. I. 66. This conception, in its most complete
shape, would have to be attributed to Justin if the fragment V. (Otto, Corp. Apol. III. p.
256) were genuine.[457] But the precise form of the presentation makes this very improbable.
The question as to how, i.e., in what conceivable way, immortality can be imparted to the mortal
nature as yet received little attention from Justin and the Apologists: it is the necessary
result of knowledge and virtue. Their great object was to assure the belief in immortality.
"Religion and morality depend on the belief in immortality or the resurrection from the dead.
The fact that the Christian religion, as faith in the incarnate Son of God the creator, leads
to the assurance that the maker of all things will reward piety and righteousness with the
bestowal of eternal and immortal life, is the essential advantage possessed by the Christian
religion over all others. The righteousness of the heathen was imperfect in spite of all their
knowledge of good and evil, because they lacked the certain knowledge that the creator makes
the just immortal and will consign the unjust to eternal torment." The philosophical doctrines
of God, virtue, and immortality became through the Apologists the certain content of a world-wide
religion, which is Christian because Christ guarantees its certainty. They made Christianity
a deistical religion for the whole world without abandoning in word at least the old "teachings
and knowledge" ([Greek: didagmata kai mathêmata]) of the Christians. They thus marked out the
task of "dogmatic" and, so to speak, wrote the prolegomena for every future theological system
in the Church (see Von Engelhardt's concluding observations in his "Christenthum Justin's"
pp. 447-490, also Overbeck in the Historische Zeitschrift, 1880, pp. 499-505.) At the same
time, however, they adhered to the early-Christian eschatology (see Justin, Melito, and, with
reference to the resurrection of the flesh, the Apologists generally), and thus did not belie
their connection with early Christianity.[458]

Interpretation and Criticism, especially of Justin's Doctrines.

1. The fundamental assumption of all the Apologists is that there can only be one and the same
relation on earth between God and free man, and that it has been conditioned by the creation.
This thought, which presupposes the idea of God's unchangeableness, at bottom neutralises every
quasi-historical and mythological consideration. According to it grace can be nothing else
than the stimulation of the powers of reason existent in man; revelation is supernatural only
in respect of its form, and the redemption merely enables us to redeem ourselves, just as this
possibility was given at the creation. Sin, which arose through temptation, appears on the
one hand as error which must almost of necessity have arisen so long as man only possessed
the "germs of the Logos" ([Greek: spermata tou logou]) and on the other as the dominion of
sensuousness, which was nearly unavoidable since earthly material clothes the soul and mighty
demons have possession of the world. The mythological idea of the invading sway of the demons
is really the only interruption of the rationalistic scheme. So far as Christianity is something
different from morality, it is the antithesis of the service and sovereignty of the demons.
Hence the idea that the course of the world and mankind require in some measure to be helped
is the narrow foundation of the thought of revelation or redemption. The necessity of revelation
and redemption was expressed in a much stronger and more decisive way by many heathen philosophers
of the same period. Accordingly, not only did these long for a revelation which would give
a fresh attestation to old truth, but they yearned for a force, a real redemption, a præsens
numen, and some new thing. Still more powerful was this longing in the case of the Gnostics
and Marcion; compare the latter's idea of revelation with that of the Apologists. It is probable
indeed that the thought of redemption would have found stronger expression among them also,
had not the task of proof, which could be best discharged by the aid of the Stoic philosophy,
demanded religious rationalism. But, admitting this, the determination of the highest good
itself involved rationalism and moralism. For immortality is the highest good, in so far as
it is perfect knowledge--which is, moreover, conceived as being of a rational kind,--that necessarily
leads to immortality. We can only find traces of the converse idea, according to which the
change into the immortal condition is the prius and the knowledge the posterius. But, where
this conception is the prevailing one, moralistic intellectualism is broken through, and we
can now point to a specific, supernatural blessing of salvation, produced by revelation and
redemption. Corresponding to the general development of religious philosophy from moralism
into mysticism (transition from the second to the third century), a displacement in this direction
can also be noticed in the history of Greek apologetics (in the West it was different); but
this displacement was never considerable and therefore cannot be clearly traced. Even later
on under altered circumstances, apologetic science adhered in every respect to its old method,
as being the most suitable (monotheism, morality, proof from prophecy), a circumstance which
is evident, for example, from the almost complete disregard of the New Testament canon of Scripture
and from other considerations besides.

2. In so far as the possibility of virtue and righteousness has been implanted by God in men,
and in so far as--apart from trifling exceptions--they can actually succeed in doing what is
good only through prophetic, i.e., divine, revelations and exhortations, some Apologists, following
the early Christian tradition, here and there designate the transformation of the sinner into
a righteous man as a work of God, and speak of renewal and regeneration. The latter, however,
as a real fact, is identical with the repentance which, as a turning from sin and turning to
God, is a matter of free will. As in Justin, so also in Tatian, the idea of regeneration is
exhausted in the divine call to repentance. The conception of the forgiveness of sins is also
determined in accordance with this. Only those sins can be forgiven, i.e., overlooked, which
are really none, i.e., which were committed in a state of error and bondage to the demons,
and were well-nigh unavoidable. The blotting out of these sins is effected in baptism, "which
is the bath of regeneration in so far as it is the voluntary consecration of one's own person.
The cleansing which takes place is God's work in so far as baptism was instituted by him, but
it is effected by the man who in his change of mind lays aside his sins. The name of God is
pronounced above him who repents of his transgressions, that he may receive freedom, knowledge,
and forgiveness of his previous sins, but this effects a change only denoting the new knowledge
to which the baptised person has attained." If, as all this seems to show, the thought of a
specific grace of God in Christ appears virtually neutralised, the adherence to the language
of the cultus (Justin and Tatian) and Justin's conception of the Lord's Supper show that the
Apologists strove to get beyond moralism, that is, they tried to supplement it through the
mysteries. Augustine's assertion (de predest. sanct. 27) that the faith of the old Church in
the efficacy of divine grace was not so much expressed in the opuscula as in the prayers, shows
correct insight.

3. All the demands, the fulfilment of which constitutes the virtue and righteousness of men,
are summed up under the title of the new law. In virtue of its eternally valid content this
new law is in reality the oldest; but it is new because Christ and the prophets were preceded
by Moses, who inculcated on the Jews in a transient form that which was eternally valid. It
is also new because, being proclaimed by the Logos that appeared in Christ, it announced its
presence with the utmost impressiveness and undoubted authority, and contains the promise of
reward in terms guaranteed by the strongest proof--the proof from prophecy. The old law is
consequently a new one because it appears now for the first time as purely spiritual, perfect,
and final. The commandment of love to one's neighbour also belongs to the law; but it does
not form its essence (still less love to God, the place of which is taken by faith, obedience,
and imitation). The content of all moral demands is comprehended in the commandment of perfect,
active holiness, which is fulfilled by the complete renunciation of all earthly blessings,
even of life itself. Tatian preached this renunciation in a specially powerful manner. There
is no need to prove that no remains of Judæo-Christianity are to be recognised in these ideas
about the new law. It is not Judæo-Christianity that lies behind the Christianity and doctrines
of the Apologists, but Greek philosophy (Platonic metaphysics, Logos doctrine of the Stoics,
Platonic and Stoic ethics), the Alexandrine-Jewish apologetics, the maxims of Jesus, and the
religious speech of the Christian Churches. Justin is distinguished from Philo by the sure
conviction of the living power of God, the Creator and Lord of the world, and the steadfast
confidence in the reality of all the ideals which is derived from the person of Christ. We
ought not, however, to blame the Apologists because to them nearly everything historical was
at bottom only a guarantee of thoughts and hopes. As a matter of fact, the assurance is not
less important than the content. By dint of thinking one can conceive the highest truth, but
one cannot in this way make out the certainty of its reality. No positive religion can do more
for its followers than faith in the revelation through Christ and the prophets did for the
Apologists. Although it chiefly proved to them the truth of that which we call natural theology
and which was the idealistic philosophy of the age, so that the Church appears as the great
insurance society for the ideas of Plato and Zeno, we ought not at the same time to forget
that their idea of a divine spirit working upon earth was a far more lively and worthy one
than in the case of the Greek philosophers.

4. By their intellectualism and exclusive theories the Apologists founded philosophic and dogmatic
Christianity (Loofs: "they laid the foundation for the conversion of Christianity into a revealed
doctrine."[459]) If about the middle of the second century the short confession of the Lord
Jesus Christ was regarded as a watchword, passport, and tessera hospitalitas (signum et vinculum),
and if even in lay and uneducated circles it was conceived as "doctrine" in contradistinction
to heresy, this transformation must have been accelerated through men, who essentially conceived
Christianity as the "divine doctrine," and by whom all its distinctive features were subordinated
to this conception or neutralised. As the philosophic schools are held together by their "laws"
([Greek: nomoi]) as the "dogmas" form the real bond between the "friends," and as, in addition
to this, they are united by veneration for the founder, so also the Christian Church appeared
to the Apologists as a universal league established by a divine founder and resting on the
dogmas of the perfectly known truth, a league the members of which possess definite laws, viz.,
the eternal laws of nature for everything moral, and unite in common veneration for the Divine
Master. In the "dogmas" of the Apologists, however, we find nothing more than traces of the
fusion of the philosophical and historical elements; in the main both exist separately side
by side. It was not till long after this that intellectualism gained the victory in a Christianity
represented by the clergy. What we here chiefly understand by "intellectualism" is the placing
of the scientific conception of the world behind the commandments of Christian morality and
behind the hopes and faith of the Christian religion, and the connecting of the two things
in such a way that this conception appeared as the foundation of these commandments and hopes.
Thus was created the future dogmatic in the form which still prevails in the Churches and which
presupposes the Platonic and Stoic conception of the world long ago overthrown by science.
The attempt made at the beginning of the Reformation to free the Christian faith from this
amalgamation remained at first without success.

[Footnote 362: The utterances of Justin do not clearly indicate whether the non-Christian portion
of mankind has only a [Greek: sperma tou logon] as a natural possession, or whether this [Greek:
sperma] has in some cases been enhanced by the inward workings of the whole Logos (inspiration).
This ambiguity, however, arises from the fact that he did not further discuss the relation
between [Greek: ho logos] and [Greek: to sperma tou logou] and we need not therefore attempt
to remove it. On the one hand, the excellent discoveries of poets and philosophers are simply
traced to [Greek: to emphuton panti genei anthrôpôn sperma tou logou] (Apol. II. 8), the [Greek:
meros spermatikou logou] (ibid) which was implanted at the creation, and on which the human
[Greek: heuresis kai theôria] depend (II. 10). In this sense it may be said of them all that
they "in human fashion attempted to understand and prove things by means of reason;" and Socrates
is merely viewed as the [Greek: pantôn eutonôteros] (ibid.), his philosophy also, like all
pre-Christian systems, being a [Greek: philosophia anthrôpeios] (II. 15). But on the other
hand Christ was known by Socrates though only [Greek: apo merous]; for "Christ was and is the
Logos who dwells in every man." Further, according to the Apologist, the [Greek: meros tou
spermatikou theiou logou] bestows the power of recognising whatever is related to the Logos
([Greek: to sungenes] II. 13). Consequently it may not only be said: [Greek: hosa para pasi
kalôs eirêtai hêmôn, tôn Christianôn esti] (ibid.), but, on the strength of the "participation"
in reason conferred on all, it may be asserted that all who have lived with the Logos ([Greek:
meta logou])--an expression which must have been ambiguous--were Christians. Among the Greeks
this specially applies to Socrates and Heraclitus (I. 46). Moreover, the Logos implanted in
man does not belong to his nature in such a sense as to prevent us saying [Greek: upo logou
dia Sôkratous êlegchthê k.t.l.] (I. 5). Nevertheless [Greek: autos ho logos] did not act in
Socrates, for this only appeared in Christ (ibid). Hence the prevailing aspect of the case
in Justin was that to which he gave expression at the close of the 2nd Apology (II. 15: alongside
of Christianity there is only human philosophy), and which, not without regard for the opposite
view, he thus formulated in II. 13 fin.: All non-Christian authors were able to attain a knowledge
of true being, though only darkly, by means of the seed of the Logos naturally implanted within
them. For the [Greek: spora] and [Greek: mimêma] of a thing, which are bestowed in proportion
to one's receptivity, are quite different from the thing itself, which divine grace bestows
on us for our possession and imitation.]

[Footnote 363: "For the sake of man" (Stoic) Apol. I. 10: II. 4, 5; Dial. 41, p. 260, Apol
I. 8: "Longing for the eternal and pure life, we strive to abide in the fellowship of God,
the Father and Creator of all things, and we hasten to make confession, because we are convinced
and firmly believe that that happiness is really attainable." It is frequently asserted that
it is the Logos which produces such conviction and awakens courage and strength.]

[Footnote 364: Justin has destroyed the force of this argument in two passages (I. 44, 59)
by tracing (like the Alexandrian Jews) all true knowledge of the poets and philosophers to
borrowing from the books of the Old Testament (Moses). Of what further use then is the [Greek:
sperma logos emphuton]? Did Justin not really take it seriously? Did he merely wish to suit
himself to those whom he was addressing? We are not justified in asserting this. Probably,
however, the adoption of that Jewish view of the history of the world is a proof that the results
of the demon sovereignty were in Justin's estimation so serious that he no longer expected
anything from the [Greek: sperma logos emphuton] when left to its own resources; and therefore
regarded truth and prophetic revelation as inseparable. But this view is not the essential
one in the Apology. That assumption of Justin's is evidently dependent on a tradition, whilst
his real opinion was more "liberal."]

[Footnote 365: Compare with this the following passages: In Apol. I. 20 are enumerated a series
of the most important doctrines common to philosophers and Christians. Then follow the words:
"If we then in particular respects even teach something similar to the doctrines of the philosophers
honoured among you, though in many cases in a divine and more sublime way; and we indeed alone
do so in such a way that the matter is proved etc." In Apol. I. 44: II. 10. 13 uncertainty,
error, and contradictions are shown to exist in the case of the greatest philosophers. The
Christian doctrines are more sublime than all human philosophy (II. 15). "Our doctrines are
evidently more sublime than any human teaching, because the Christ who appeared for our sakes
was the whole fulness of reason" ([Greek: to logikon to holon], II. 10). "The principles of
Plato are not foreign ([Greek: allotria]) to the teaching of Christ, but they do not agree
in every respect. The same holds good of the Stoics" (II. 13). "We must go forth from the school
of Plato" (II. 12). "Socrates convinced no one in such a way that he would have been willing
to die for the doctrine proclaimed by him; whereas not only philosophers and philologers, but
also artisans and quite common uneducated people have believed in Christ" (II. 10). These are
the very people--and that is perhaps the strongest contrast found between Logos and Logos in
Justin--among whom it is universally said of Christianity: [Greek: dunamis esti tou arrêtou
patros kai ouchi anthrôpeiou logou kataskeuê] (see also I. 14 and elsewhere.)]

[Footnote 366: In Justin's estimate of the Greek philosophers two other points deserve notice.
In the first place, he draws a very sharp distinction between real and nominal philosophers.
By the latter he specially means the Epicureans. They are no doubt referred to in I. 4, 7,
26 (I. 14: Atheists). Epicurus and Sardanapalus are classed together in II. 7; Epicurus and
the immoral poets in II. 12; and in the conclusion of II, 15 the same philosopher is ranked
with the worst society. But according to II. 3 fin. ([Greek: adunaton Kunikô, adiaphoron to
telos prothemenô, to agathon eidenai plên adikphorias]) the Cynics also seem to be outside
the circle of real philosophers. This is composed principally of Socrates, Plato, the Platonists
and Stoics, together with Heraclitus and others. Some of these understood one set of doctrines
more correctly, others another series. The Stoics excelled in ethics (II. 7); Plato described
the Deity and the world more correctly. It is, however, worthy of note--and this is the second
point--that Justin in principle conceived the Greek philosophers as a unity, and that he therefore
saw in their very deviations from one another a proof of the imperfection of their teaching.
In so far as they are all included under the collective idea "human philosophy," philosophy
is characterised by the conflicting opinions found within it. This view was suggested to Justin
by the fact that the highest truth, which is at once allied and opposed to human philosophy,
was found by him among an exclusive circle of fellow-believers. Justin showed great skill in
selecting from the Gospels the passages (I. 15-17), that prove the "philosophical" life of
the Christians as described by him in c. 14. Here he cannot be acquitted of colouring the facts
(cf. Aristides) nor of exaggeration (see, for instance, the unqualified statement: [Greek:
ha echomen eis koinon pherontes kai panti deomenô koinônountes]). The philosophical emperors
were meant here to think of the "[Greek: philois panta koina]." Yet in I. 67 Justin corrected
exaggerations in his description. Justin's reference to the invaluable benefits which Christianity
confers on the state deserves notice (see particularly I. 12, 17.) The later Apologists make
a similar remark.]

[Footnote 367: Dialogue 8. The dialogue takes up a more positive attitude than the Apology,
both as a whole and in detail. If we consider that both works are also meant for Christians,
and that, on the other hand, the Dialogue as well as the Apology appeals to the cultured heathen
public, we may perhaps assume that the two writings were meant to present a graduated system
of Christian instruction. (In one passage the Dialogue expressly refers to the Apology.) From
Justin's time onward the apologetic polemic of the early Church appears to have adhered throughout
to the same method. This consisted in giving the polemical writings directed against the Greeks
the form of an introduction to Christian knowledge, and in continuing this instruction still
further in those directed against the Jews.]

[Footnote 368: Dial. 2. sq. That Justin's Christianity is founded on theoretical scepticism
is clearly shown by the introduction to the Dialogue.]

in detail.]

[Footnote 384: The Apology which Miltiades addressed to Marcus Aurelius and his fellow-emperor
perhaps bore the title: [Greek: huper tês kata Christianous philosophias] (Euseb., H. E. V.
17. 5). It is certain that Melito in his Apology designated Christianity as [Greek: hê kath'
hêmas philosophia] (l.c., IV. 26. 7). But, while it is undeniable that this writer attempted,
to a hitherto unexampled extent, to represent Christianity as adapted to the Empire, we must
nevertheless beware of laying undue weight on the expression "philosophy." What Melito means
chiefly to emphasise is the fact that Christianity, which in former times had developed into
strength among the barbarians, began to flourish in the provinces of the Empire simultaneously
with the rise of the monarchy under Augustus, that as foster-sister of the monarchy, it increased
in strength with the latter, and that this mutual relation of the two institutions had given
prosperity and splendour to the state. When in the fragments preserved to us he twice, in this
connection, calls Christianity "philosophy," we must note that this expression alternates with
the other "[Greek: ho kath' hêmas logos]", and that he uses the formula: "Thy forefathers held
this philosophy in honour along with the other cults" [Greek: pros tais allais thrêskeichis].
This excludes the assumption that Melito in his Apology merely represented Christian as philosophy
(see also IV. 26. 5, where the Christians are called "[Greek: to tôn theosebôn genos]"). He
also wrote a treatise [Greek: peri ktiseôs kai geneseôs Christou]. In it (fragment in the Chron.
Pasch) he called Christ [Greek: Theou logos pro aiônôn].]

[Footnote 385: See my treatise "Tatian's Rede an die Griechen übers." 1884 (Giessener Programm).

[Footnote 386: But see Orat. 4 init., 24 fin., 25 fin., 27 init.]

[Footnote 387: He not only accentuated the disagreement of philosophers more strongly than
Justin, but insisted more energetically than that Apologist on the necessity of viewing the
practical fruits of philosophy in life as a criterion; see Orat. 2, 3, 19, 25. Nevertheless
Socrates still found grace in his eyes (c. 3). With regard to other philosophers he listened
to foolish and slanderous gossip.]

[Footnote 388: Orat. 13, 15 fin., 20. Tatian also gave credence to it because it imparts such
an intelligible picture of the creation of the world (c. 29).]

[Footnote 389: Orat. 12: [Greek: ta tês hêmeteras paideias estin anôterô tês kosmikês katalêpseôs].
Tatian troubled himself very little with giving demonstrations. No other Apologist made such
bold assertions.]

[Footnote 390: See Orat. 12 (p. 54 fin.), 20 (p. 90), 25 fin., 26 fin., 29, 30 (p. 116), 13
(p. 62), 15 (p. 70), 36 (p. 142), 40 (p. 152 sq.). The section cc. 12-15 of the Oratio is very
important (see also c. 7 ff); for it shows that Tatian denied the natural immortality of the
soul, declared the soul (the material spirit) to be something inherent in all matter, and accordingly
looked on the distinction between men and animals in respect of their inalienable natural constitution
as only one of degree. According to this Apologist the dignity of man does not consist in his
natural endowments: but in the union of the human soul with the divine spirit, for which union
indeed he was planned. But, in Tatian's opinion, man lost this union by falling under the sovereignty
of the demons. The Spirit of God has left him, and consequently he has fallen back to the level
of the beasts. So it is man's task to unite the Spirit again with himself, and thereby recover
that religious principle on which all wisdom and knowledge rest. This anthropology is opposed
to that of the Stoics and related to the "Gnostic" theory. It follows from it that man, in
order to reach his destination, must raise himself above his natural endowment; see c. 15:
[Greek: anthrôpon legô ton porrô men anthrôptêtos pros auton de ton Theon kechôrêkota]. But
with Tatian this conception is burdened with radical inconsistency; for he assumes that the
Spirit reunites itself with every man who rightly uses his freedom, and he thinks it still
possible for every person to use his freedom aright (11 fin., 13 fin., 15 fin.) So it is after
all a mere assertion that the natural man is only distinguished from the beast by speech. He
is also distinguished from it by freedom. And further it is only in appearance that the blessing
bestowed in the "Spirit" is a donum superadditum et supernaturale. For if a proper spontaneous
use of freedom infallibly leads to the return of the Spirit, it is evident that the decision
and consequently the realisation of man's destination depend on human freedom. That is, however,
the proposition which all the Apologists maintained. But indeed Tatian himself in his latter
days seems to have observed the inconsistency in which he had become involved and to have solved
the problem in the Gnostic, that is, the religious sense. In his eyes, of course, the ordinary
philosophy is a useless and pernicious art; philosophers make their own opinions laws (c. 27);
whereas of Christians the following holds good (c. 32): [Greek: logou tou dêmosiou kai epigeiou
kechôrismenoi kai peithomenoi theou parangelmasi kai nomô patros aphtharsias hepomenoi, pan
to en doxê keimenon anthrôpinê paraitoumetha].]

[Footnote 391: C. 31. init.: [Greek: hê hêmetera philosophia]. 32 (p. 128): [Greek: hoi boulomenoi
philosophein par' hêmin anthrôpoi]. In c. 33 (p. 130) Christian women are designated [Greek:
hai par hêmin philosophousai]. C. 35: [Greek: hê kath' hêmas barbaros philosophia]. 40 (p.
152): [Greek: hoi kata Môusea kai homoiôs autô philosophountes]. 42: [Greek: ho kata barbarous
philosophôn Tatianos]. The [Greek: dogmata] of the Christians: c. 1 (p. 2), 12 (p. 58), 19
(p. 86), 24 (p. 102), 27 (p. 108), 35 (p. 138), 40, 42. But Tatian pretty frequently calls
Christianity "[Greek: hê hêmetera paideia]", once also "[Greek: nomothesia]" (12; cf. 40: [Greek:
hoi hêmeteroi nomoi]), and often [Greek: politeia].]

[Footnote 392: See, e.g., c. 29 fin.: the Christian doctrine gives us [Greek: ouch hoper mê
elabomen, all' hoper labontes hupo tês planês echein ekoluthêmen].]

[Footnote 393: Tatian gave still stronger expression than Justin to the opinion that it is
the demons who have misled men and rule the world, and that revelation through the prophets
is opposed to this demon rule; see c. 7 ff. The demons have fixed the laws of death; see c.
15 fin. and elsewhere.]

[Footnote 394: Tatian also cannot at bottom distinguish between revelation through the prophets
and through Christ. See the description of his conversion in c. 29. where only the Old Testament
writings are named, and c. 13 fin., 20 fin.. 12 (p. 54) etc.]

[Footnote 395: Knowledge and life appear in Tatian most closely connected. See, e.g., c. 13
init.: "In itself the soul is not immortal, but mortal; it is also possible, however, that
it may not die. If it has not attained a knowledge of that truth it dies and is dissolved with
the body; but later, at the end of the world, it will rise again with the body in order to
receive death in endless duration as a punishment. On the contrary it does not die, though
it is dissolved for a time, if it is equipped with the knowledge of God."]

[Footnote 396: Barbarian: the Christian doctrines are [Greek: ta tôn barbarôn dogmata] (c.
1): [Greek: kath' hêmas barbaros philosophia] (c. 35); [Greek: hê barbarikê nomothesia] (c.
12); [Greek: graphai barbarikai] (c. 29); [Greek: kainotomein ta barbarôn dogmata] (c. 35);
[Greek: ho kata barbarous philosophôn Tatianos] (c. 42); [Greek: Môusês pasês barbarou philosophias
archêgos] (c. 31); see also c. 30, 32. In Tatian's view barbarians and Greeks are the decisive
contrasts in history.]

[Footnote 397: See the proof from antiquity, c. 31 ff.]

[Footnote 398: C. 30 (p. 114): [Greek: toutôn oun tên katalêpsin memuêmenos].]

[Footnote 399: Tatian's own confession is very important here (c. 26): "Whilst I was reflecting
on what was good it happened that there fell into my hands certain writings of the barbarians,
too old to be compared with the doctrines of the Greeks, too divine to be compared with their
errors. And it chanced that they convinced me through the plainness of their expressions, through
the unartificial nature of their language, through the intelligible representation of the creation
of the world, through the prediction of the future, the excellence of their precepts, and the
summing up of all kinds under one head. My soul was instructed by God and I recognised that
those Greek doctrines lead to perdition, whereas the others abolish the slavery to which we
are subjected in the world, and rescue us from our many lords and tyrants, though they do not
give us blessings we had not already received, but rather such as we had indeed obtained, but
were not able to retain in consequence of error." Here the whole theology of the Apologists
is contained in nuce; see Justin, Dial. 7-8. In Chaps. 32, 33 Tatian strongly emphasises the
fact that the Christian philosophy is accessible even to the most uneducated; see Justin, Apol.
II. 10; Athenag. 11 etc.]

[Footnote 400: The unknown author of the [Greek: Logos pros Ellênas] also formed the same judgment
as Tatian (Corp. Apolog., T. III., p. 2 sq., ed. Otto; a Syrian translation, greatly amplified,
is found in the Cod. Nitr. Mus. Britt. Add. 14658. It was published by Cureton, Spic. Syr.,
p. 38 sq. with an English translation). Christianity is an incomparable heavenly wisdom, the
teacher of which is the Logos himself. "It produces neither poets, nor philosophers, nor rhetoricians;
but it makes mortals immortal and men gods, and leads them away upwards from the earth into
super-Olympian regions." Through Christian knowledge the soul returns to its Creator: [Greek:
dei gar apokatatathênai othen apestê].]

[Footnote 401: Nor is Plato "[Greek: ho dokôn en autois semnoteron pephilosophêkenai]" any
better than Epicurus and the Stoics (III. 6). Correct views which are found in him in a greater
measure than in the others ([Greek: ho dokôn Hellênôn sophôteros gegenêsthai]), did not prevent
him from giving way to the stupidest babbling (III. 16). Although he knew that the full truth
can only be learned from God himself through the law (III. 17), he indulged in the most foolish
guesses concerning the beginning of history. But where guesses find a place, truth is not to
be found (III. 16: [Greek: ei de eikasmô, ouk ara alêthê estin ta hup' autou eirêmena]).]

[Footnote 402: Theophilus confesses (I. 14) exactly as Tatian does: [Greek: kai gar egô êpistoun
touto esesthai, alla nun katanoêsas auta pisteuô, hama kai epituchôn hierais graphais tôn agiôn
prophêtôn, hoi kai proeipon dia pneumatos Theou ti progegonota ô tropô gegonen kai ta enestôta
tini tropô ginetai, kai ta eperchomena poia taxei apartisthêsetai. Apodeixin oun labôn tôn
ginomenôn kai proanapephônêmenôn ouk apistô]; see also II. 8-10, 22, 30, 33-35: III. 10, 11,
17. Theophilus merely looks on the Gospel as a continuation of the prophetic revelations and
injunctions. Of Christ, however, he did not speak at all, but only of the Logos (Pneuma), which
has operated from the beginning. To Theophilus the first chapters of Genesis already contain
the sum of all Christian knowledge (II. 10-32).]

[Footnote 403: See II. 8: [Greek: hupo daimonôn de empneusthentes kai hup' autôn phusiôthentes
ha eipon di' autôn eipon].]

[Footnote 404: The unknown author of the work de resurrectione, which goes under the name of
Justin (Corp. Apol., Vol. III.) has given a surprising expression to the thought that it is
simply impossible to give a demonstration of truth. ([Greek: O men tês alêtheias logos estin
eleutheroste kai autexousios, upo mêdemian basanon elegchou thelôn piptein mêde tên para tois
akouousi di' apodeixeôs exetasin hupomenein. To gar eugenes autou kai pepoithos autô tô pempsanti
pisteuesthai thelei]). He inveighs in the beginning of his treatise against all rationalism,
and on the one hand professes a sort of materialistic theory of knowledge, whilst on the other,
for that very reason, he believes in inspiration and the authority of revelation; for all truth
originates with revelation, since God himself and God alone is the truth. Christ revealed this
truth and is for us [Greek: tôn olôn pistis kai apodeixis]. But it is far from probable that
the author would really have carried this proposition to its logical conclusion (Justin, Dial.
3 ff. made a similar start). He wishes to meet his adversaries "armed with the arguments of
faith which are unconquered" (c. 1, p. 214), but the arguments of faith are still the arguments
of reason. Among these he regarded it as most important that even according to the theories
about the world, that is, about God and matter, held by the "so-called sages," Plato, Epicurus,
and the Stoics, the assumption of a resurrection of the flesh is not irrational (c. 6, p. 228
f.). Some of these, viz., Pythagoras and Plato, also acknowledged the immortality of the soul.
But, for that very reason, this view is not sufficient, "for if the Redeemer had only brought
the message of the (eternal) life of the soul what new thing would he have proclaimed in addition
to what had been made known by Pythagoras, Plato, and the band of their adherents?" (c. 10,
p. 246.) This remark is very instructive, for it shows what considerations led the Apologists
to adhere to the belief in the resurrection of the body. Zahn, (Zeitschrift fur Kirchengeschichte,
Vol. VIII., pp. 1 f., 20 f.) has lately reassigned to Justin himself the fragment de resurr.
His argument, though displaying great plausibility, has nevertheless not fully convinced me.
The question is of great importance for fixing the relation of Justin to Paul. I shall not
discuss Hermias' "Irrisio Gentilium Philosophorum," as the period when this Christian disputant
flourished is quite uncertain. We still possess an early-Church Apology in Pseudo-Melito's
"Oratio ad Antoninum Cæsarem" (Otto, Corp. Apol. IX., p. 423 sq.). This book is preserved (written?)
in the Syrian language and was addressed to Caracalla or Heliogabalus (preserved in the Cod.
Nitr. Mus. Britt. Add. 14658). It is probably dependent on Justin, but it is less polished
and more violent than his Apology.]

[Footnote 405: Massebieau (Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1887, Vol. XV. No. 3) has convinced
me that Minucius wrote at a later period than Tertullian and made use of his works.]

[Footnote 406: Cf. the plan of the "Octavius." The champion of heathenism here opposed to the
Christian is a philosopher representing the standpoint of the middle Academy. This presupposes,
as a matter of course, that the latter undertakes the defence of the Stoical position. See,
besides, the corresponding arguments in the Apology of Tertullian, e.g., c. 17, as well as
his tractate: "de testimonio animæ naturaliter Christianæ." We need merely mention that the
work of Minucius is throughout dependent on Cicero's book, "de natura deorum." In this treatise
he takes up a position more nearly akin to heathen syncretism than Tertullian.]

[Footnote 407: In R. Kühn's investigation ("Der Octavius des Min. Felix," Leipzig, 1882)--the
best special work we possess on an early Christian Apology from the point of view of the history
of dogma--based on a very careful analysis of the Octavius, more emphasis is laid on the difference
than on the agreement between Minucius and the Greek Apologists. The author's exposition requires
to be supplemented in the latter respect (see Theologische Litteratur-Zeitung, 1883, No. 6).]

[Footnote 408: C. 20: "Exposui opiniones omnium ferme philosophorum.... ut quivis arbitretur,
aut nunc Christianos philosophos esse aut philosophos fuisse jam tunc Christianos."]

[Footnote 409: See Minucius, 31 ff. A quite similar proceeding is already found in Tertullian,
who in his Apologeticum has everywhere given a Stoic colouring to Christian ethics and rules
of life, and in c. 39 has drawn a complete veil over the peculiarity of the Christian societies.]

[Footnote 410: Tertullian has done exactly the same thing; see Apolog. 46 (and de præscr. 7.)]

[Footnote 411: Tertull., de testim. I.: "Sed non eam te (animam) advoco, quæ scholis formata,
bibliothecis exercitata, academiis et porticibus Atticis pasta sapientiam ructas. Te simplicem
et rudem et impoliitam et idioticam compello, qualem te habent qui te solam habent... Imperitia
tua mihi opus est, quoniam aliquantulæ peritiæ tuæ nemo credit."]

[Footnote 412: Tertull., Apol. 46: "Quid simile philosophus et Christianas? Græciæ discipulus
et coeli?" de præscr. 7: "Quid ergo Athenis et Hierosolymis? Quid academiæ et ecclesiæ?" Minuc.
38.5: "Philosophorum supercilia contemnimus, quos corruptores et adulteros novimus... nos,
qui non habitu sapientiam sed mente præferimus, non eloquimur magna sed vivimus, gloriamur
nos consecutos, quod illi summa intentione quæsiverunt nec invenire potuerunt. Quid ingrati
sumus, quid nobis invidemus, si veritas divinitatis nostri temporis ælate maturuit?"]

[Footnote 413: Minucius did not enter closely into the significance of Christ any more than
Tatian, Athenagoras, and Theophilus; he merely touched upon it (9. 4: 29. 2). He also viewed
Christianity as the teaching of the Prophets; whoever acknowledges the latter must of necessity
adore the crucified Christ. Tertullian was accordingly the first Apologist after Justin who
again considered it necessary to give a detailed account of Christ as the incarnation of the
Logos (see the 21st chapter of the Apology in its relation to chaps. 17-20).]

[Footnote 414: Among the Greek Apologists the unknown author of the work "de Monarchia," which
bears the name of Justin, has given clearest expression to this conception. He is therefore
most akin to Minucius (see chap. I.). Here monotheism is designated as the [Greek: katholikê
doxa] which has fallen into oblivion through bad habit; for [Greek: tês anthrôpinês phuseôs
to kat' archên suzugian suneseôs kai sôtêrias labousês eis epignôsin alêtheias thrêskeias te
tês eis ton hena kai pantôn despotên.] According to this, then, only an awakening is required.]

[Footnote 415: But almost all the Apologists acknowledged that heathendom possessed prophets.
They recognise these in the Sibyls and the old poets. The author of the work "de Monarchia"
expressed the most pronounced views in regard to this. Hermas (Vis. II. 4), however, shows
that the Apologists owed this notion also to an idea that was widespread among Christian people.]

[Footnote 416: See Justin, Apol. I. 31, Dial. 7, p. 30 etc.]

[Footnote 417: See Tatian, c. 31 ff.]

[Footnote 418: In the New Testament the content of the Christian faith is now here designated
as dogma. In Clement (I. 11.), Hermas, and Polycarp the word is not found at all; yet Clement
(I. 20. 4, 27. 5) called the divine order of nature [Greek: ta dedogmatismena hupo Theou].
In Ignatius (ad Magn. XIII. 1) we read: [Greek: spoudazete oun bebaiôthênai en tois dogmasin
tou kuriou kai tôn apostolôn], but [Greek: dogmata] here exclusively mean the rules of life
(see Zahn on this passage), and this is also their signification in [Greek: Didachê] XI. 3.
In the Epistle of Barnabas we read in several passages (I. 6: IX. 7: X. 1, 9 f.) of "dogmas
of the Lord;" but by these he means partly particular mysteries, partly divine dispensations.
Hence the Apologists are the first to apply the word to the Christian faith, in accordance
with the language of philosophy. They are also the first who employed the ideas [Greek: theologein]
and [Greek: theologia]. The latter word is twice found in Justin (Dial. 56) in the sense of
"aliquem nominare deum." In Dial. 113, however, it has the more comprehensive sense of "to
make religio-scientific investigations." Tatian (10) also used the word in the first sense;
on the contrary he entitled a book of which he was the author "[Greek: pros tous apophênamenous
ta peri Theou]" and not "[Greek: pros tous theologountas]". In Athenagoras (Suppl. 10) theology
is the doctrine of God and of all beings to whom the predicate "Deity" belongs (see also 20,
22). That is the old usage of the word. It was thus employed by Tertullian in ad nat. II. 1
(the threefold division of theology; in II. 2, 3 the expression "theologia physica, mythica"
refers to this); Cohort, ad Gr. 3, 22. The anonymous writer in Eusebius (H. E. V. 28. 4, 5)
is instructive on the point. Brilliant demonstrations of the ancient use of the word "theology"
are found in Natorp, Thema und Disposition der aristotelischen Metaphysik (Philosophische Monatshefte,
1887, Parts I and 2, pp. 55-64). The title "theology," as applied to a philosophic discipline,
was first used by the Stoics; the old poets were previously called "theologians," and the "theological"
stage was the prescientific one which is even earlier than the "childhood" of "physicists"
(so Aristotle speaks throughout). To the Fathers of the Church also the old poets are still
[Greek: hoi palaioi theologoi]. But side by side with this we have an adoption of the Stoic
view that there is also a philosophical theology, because the teaching of the old poets concerning
the gods conceals under the veil of myth a treasure of philosophical truth. In the Stoa arose
the "impossible idea of a 'theology' which is to be philosophy, that is, knowledge based on
reason, and yet to have positive religion as the foundation of its certainty." The Apologists
accepted this, but added to it the distinction of a [Greek: kosmikê] and [Greek: theologikê
sophia.]]

[Footnote 419: Christ has a relation to all three parts of the scheme, (1) as [Greek: logos];
(2) as [Greek: nomos, nomothetês], and [Greek: kritês]; (3) as [Greek: didaskalos] and [Greek:
sotêr].]

[Footnote 420: In the reproduction of the apologetical theology historians of dogma have preferred
to follow Justin; but here they have constantly overlooked the fact that Justin was the most
Christian among the Apologists, and that the features of his teaching to which particular value
is rightly attached, are either not found in the others at all (with the exception of Tertullian),
or else in quite rudimentary form. It is therefore proper to put the doctrines common to all
the Apologists in the foreground, and to describe what is peculiar to Justin as such, so far
as it agree with New Testament teachings or contains an anticipation of the future tenor of dogma.]

[Footnote 421: Cicero's proposition (de nat. deor. II. 66. That all knowledge of the truth,
both among the prophets and those who follow their teaching, is derived from inspiration was
in their eyes a matter of certainty. But here they were only able to frame a theory in the
case of the prophets; for such a theory strictly applied to all would have threatened the spontaneous
character of the knowledge of the truth.]

[Footnote 422: Justin, Apol. I. 3: [Greek: Hêmeteron oun ergon kai biou kai mathêmatôn tên
episkepsin pasi parechein].]

[Footnote 423: See the exposition of the doctrine of God in Aristides with the conclusion found
in all the Apologists, that God requires no offerings and presents.]

[Footnote 424: Even Tatian says in c. 19: [Greek: Kosmou men gar ê kataskeuê kalê, to de en
autô politeuma phaulon].]

[Footnote 425: Tatian 5: [Greek: Oute anarchos ê hulê kathaper ho Theos, oude dia to anarchon
kai autê isodunamos tô Theô gennêtê de kai ouch hupo tou allou gegonuia monon de hupo tou pantôn
dêmiourgou probeblêmenê]. 12. Even Justin does not seem to have taught otherwise, though that
is not quite certain; see Apol. I. 10, 59, 64, 67: II. 6. Theophilus I. 4: II. 4, 10, 13 says
very plainly: [Greek: ex ouk ontôn ta panta epoiêsen.... ti de mega, ei ho theos ex hupokeimenês
hulês epoiei ton kosmon].]

[Footnote 426: Hence the knowledge of God and the right knowledge of the world are most closely
connected; see Tatian 27: [Greek: hê Theou katalêpsis ên echô peri tôn holôn].]

[Footnote 427: The beginning of the fifth chapter of Tatian's Oration is specially instructive
here.]

[Footnote 428: According to what has been set forth in the text it is incorrect to assert that
the Apologists adopted the Logos doctrine in order to reconcile monotheism with the divine
honours paid to the crucified Christ. The truth rather is that the Logos doctrine was already
part of their creed before they gave any consideration to the person of the historical Christ,
and vice versâ Christ's right to divine honours was to them a matter of certainty independently
of the Logos doctrine.]

[Footnote 429: We find the distinction of Logos (Son) and Spirit in Justin, Apol. I. 5, and
in every case where he quotes formulæ (if we are not to assume the existence of interpolation
in the text, which seems to me not improbable; see now also Cramer in the Theologische Studien,
1893. pp. 17 ff., 138 ff.). In Tatian 13 fin. the Spirit is represented as [Greek: ho diakonos
tou peponthotos Theou]. The conception in Justin, Dial. 116, is similar. Father, Word, and
prophetic Spirit are spoken of in Athenag. 10. The express designation [Greek: trias] is first
found in Theophilus (but see the Excerpta ex Theodoto); see II. 15: [Greek: hai treis hêmerai
tupoi heisin tês triados, tou Theou kai tou logou autou kai tês sophias autou]; see II. 10,
18. But it is just in Theophilus that the difficulty of deciding between Logos and Wisdom appears
with special plainness (II. 10). The interposition of the host of good angels between Son and
Spirit found in Justin, Apol. I. 5 (see Athenag.), is exceedingly striking. We have, however,
to notice, provided the text is right, (1) that this interposition is only found in a single
passage, (2) that Justin wished to refute the reproach of [Greek: atheotês], (3) that the placing
of the Spirit after the angels does not necessarily imply a position inferior to theirs, but
merely a subordination to the Son and the Father common to the Spirit and the angels, (4) that
the good angels were also invoked by the Christians, because they were conceived as mediators
of prayer (see my remark on I. Clem, ad Corinth. LVI. 1); they might have found a place here
just for this latter reason. On the significance of the Holy Spirit in the theology of Justin,
see Zahn's Marcellus of Ancyra, p. 228: "If there be any one theologian of the early Church
who might be regarded as depriving the Holy Spirit of all scientific raison d'etre at least
on the ground of having no distinctive activity, and the Father of all share in revelation,
it is Justin." We cannot at bottom say that the Apologists possessed a doctrine of the Trinity.]

[Footnote 430: To Justin the name of the Son is the most important; see also Athenag. 10. The
Logos had indeed been already called the Son of God by Philo, and Celsus expressly says (Orig.,
c. Cels. II. 31); "If according to your doctrine the Word is really the Son of God then we
agree with you;" but the Apologists are the first to attach the name of Son to the Logos as
a proper designation. If, however, the Logos is intrinsically the Son of God, then Christ is
the Son of God, not because he is the begotten of God in the flesh (early Christian), but because
the spiritual being existing in him is the antemundane reproduction of God (see Justin, Apol.
II. 6: [Greek: ho huios tou patros kai Theou, ho monos legomenos kuriôs huios])--a momentous
expression.]

[Footnote 431: Athenag., 10; Tatian, Orat. 5.]

[Footnote 432: The clearest expression of this is in Tatian 5, which passage is also to be
compared with the following: [Greek: Theos ên en archê, tên de archên logou dunamin pareilêphamen.
Thelêmati de tês aplotêtos autou propêda logos, ho de logos, ou kata kenou chôrêsas, ergon
prôtotokon tou patros ginetai. Touton ismen tou kosmou tên archên. Gegone de kata merismon,

ho logos proelthôn ek tês tou patros dunameôs ouk alogon pepoiêke ton gegennêkota]. In the
identification of the divine consciousness, that is, the power of God, with the force to which
the world is due the naturalistic basis of the apologetic speculations is most clearly shown.
Cf. Justin, Dial. 128, 129.]

[Footnote 433: The word "beget" ([Greek: gennan]) is used by the Apologists, especially Justin,
because the name "Son" was the recognised expression for the Logos. No doubt the words [Greek:
exereugesthai, proballesthai, proerchesthai, propêdan] and the like express the physical process
more exactly in the sense of the Apologists. On the other hand, however, [Greek: gennan] appears
the more appropriate word in so far as the relation of the essence of the Logos to the essence
of God is most clearly shown by the name "Son."]

[Footnote 434: None of the Apologists has precisely defined the Logos idea. Zahn, l.c., p.
233, correctly remarks: "Whilst the distinction drawn between the hitherto unspoken and the
spoken word of the Creator makes Christ appear as the thought of the world within the mind
of God, yet he is also to be something real which only requires to enter into a new relation
to God to become an active force. Then again this Word is not to be the thought that God thinks,
but the thought that thinks in God. And again it is to be a something, or an Ego, in God's
thinking essence, which enters into reciprocal intercourse with something else in God; occasionally
also the reason of God which is in a state of active exercise and without which he would not
be rational." Considering this evident uncertainty it appears to me a very dubious proceeding
to differentiate the conceptions of the Logos in Justin, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus,
as is usually done. If we consider that no Apologist wrote a special treatise on the Logos,
that Tatian (c. 5) is really the only one from whom we have any precise statements, and that
the elements of the conception are the same in all, it appears inadvisable to lay so great
stress on the difference as Zahn, for instance, has done in the book already referred to, p.
232 f. Hardly any real difference can have existed between Justin, Tatian, and Theophilus in
the Logos doctrine proper. On the other hand Athenagoras certainly seems to have tried to eliminate
the appearance of the Logos in time, and to emphasise the eternal nature of the divine relationships,
without, however, reaching the position which Irenæus took up here.]

[Footnote 435: This distinction is only found in Theophilus (II. 10); but the idea exists in
Tatian and probably also in Justin, though it is uncertain whether Justin regarded the Logos
as having any sort of being before the moment of his begetting.]

[Footnote 436: Justin, Apol. II. 6., Dial. 61. The Logos is not produced out of nothing, like
the rest of the creatures. Yet it is evident that the Apologists did not yet sharply and precisely
distinguish between begetting and creating, as the later theologians did; though some of them
certainly felt the necessity for a distinction.]

[Footnote 437: All the Apologists tacitly assume that the Logos in virtue of his origin has
the capacity of entering the finite. The distinction which here exists between Father and Son
is very pregnantly expressed by Tertullian (adv. Marc. II. 27): "Igitur quæcumque exigitis
deo digna, habebuntur in patre invisibili incongressibilique et placido et, ut ita dixerim,
philosophorum deo. Quæcumque autem ut indigna reprehenditis deputabuntur in filio et viso et
audito et congresso, arbitro patris et ministro." But we ought not to charge the Apologists
with the theologoumenon that it was an inward necessity for the Logos to become man. Their
Logos hovers, as it were, between God and the world, so that he appears as the highest creature,
in so far as he is conceived as the production of God; and again seems to be merged in God,
in so far as he is looked upon as the consciousness and spiritual force of God. To Justin,
however, the incarnation is irrational, and the rest of the Greek Apologists are silent about it.]

[Footnote 438: The most of the Apologists argue against the conception of the natural immortality
of the human soul; see Tatian 13; Justin, Dial. 5; Theoph. II. 27.]

[Footnote 439: The first chapter of Genesis represented to them the sum of all wisdom, and
therefore of all Christianity. Perhaps Justin had already written a commentary to the Hexaëmeron
(see my Texte und Untersuchungen I. 1, 2, p. 169 f.). It is certain that in the second century
Rhodon (Euseb., H. E. V. 13. 8), Theophilus (see his 2nd Book ad Autol.), Candidus, and Apion
(Euseb., H. E. V. 27) composed such. The Gnostics also occupied themselves a great deal with
Gen. I.-III.; see, e.g., Marcus in Iren. I. 18.]

[Footnote 440: See Theophilus ad Aut. II. 27: [Greek: Ei gar ho Theos athanaton ton anthrôpon
ap' archês pepoiêkei, Theon auton pepoiêkei; palin ei thnêton auton pepoiêkei edokei an ho

[Footnote 441: See Justin, Apol. I. 14 ff. and the parallel passages in the other Apologists.]

[Footnote 442: See Tatian, Orat. II. and many other passages.]

[Footnote 443: Along with this the Apologists emphasise the resurrection of the flesh in the
strongest way as the specific article of Christian anticipation, and prove the possibility
of realising this irrational hope. Yet to the Apologists the ultimate ground of their trust
in this early-Christian idea is their reliance on the unlimited omnipotence of God and this
confidence is a proof of the vividness of their idea of him. Nevertheless this conception assumes
that in the other world there will be a return of the flesh, which on this side the grave had
to be overcome and regarded as non-existent. A clearly chiliastic element is found only in Justin.]

[Footnote 444: No uniform conception of this is found in the Apologists; see Wendt, Die Christliche
Lehre von der menschlichen Vollkommenheit 1882, pp. 8-20. Justin speaks only of a heavenly
destination for which man is naturally adapted. With Tatian and Theophilus it is different.]

[Footnote 445: The idea that the demon sovereignty has led to some change in the psychological
condition and capacities of man is absolutely unknown to Justin (see Wendt, l.c., p. 11 f.,
who has successfully defended the correct view in Engelhardt's "Das Christenthum Justin's des
Märtyrers" pp. 92 f. 151. f. 266 f., against Stählin, "Justin der Märtyrer und sein neuester
Beurtheiler" 1880, p. 16 f.). Tatian expressed a different opinion, which, however, involved
him in evident contradictions (see above, p. 191 ff.). The apologetic theology necessarily
adhered to the two following propositions: (1) The freedom to do what is good is not lost and
cannot be. This doctrine was opposed to philosophic determinism and popular fatalism. (2) The
desires of the flesh resulting from the constitution of man only become evil when they destroy
or endanger the sovereignty of reason. The formal liberum arbitrium explains the possibility
of sin, whilst its actual existence is accounted for by the desire that is excited by the demons.
The Apologists acknowledge the universality of sin and death, but refused to admit the necessity
of the former in order not to call its guilty character in question. On the other hand they
are deeply imbued with the idea that the sovereignty of death is the most powerful factor in
the perpetuation of sin. Their believing conviction of the omnipotence of God, as well as their
moral conviction of the responsibility of man, protected them in theory from a strictly dualistic
conception of the world. At the same time, like all who separate nature and morality in their
ethical system, though in other respects they do not do so, the Apologists were obliged in
practice to be dualists.]

[Footnote 446: Death is accounted the worst evil. When Theophilus (II. 26) represents it as
a blessing, we must consider that he is arguing against Marcion. Polytheism is traced to the
demons; they are accounted the authors of the fables about the gods; the shameful actions of
the latter are partly the deeds of demons and partly lies.]

[Footnote 447: The Old Testament therefore is not primarily viewed as the book of prophecy
or of preparation for Christ, but as the book of the full revelation which cannot be surpassed.
In point of content the teaching of the prophets and of Christ is completely identical. The
prophetical details in the Old Testament serve only to attest the one truth. The Apologists
confess that they were converted to Christianity by reading the Old Testament. Cf. Justin's
and Tatian's confessions. Perhaps Commodian (Instruct. I. 1) is also be understood thus.]

[Footnote 448: The Oratio of Tatian is very instructive in this respect. In this book he has
nowhere spoken ex professo of the incarnation of the Logos in Christ; but in c. 13 fin. he
calls the Holy Spirit "the servant of God who has suffered," and in c. 21 init. he says: "we
are not fools and do not adduce anything stupid, when we proclaim that God has appeared in
human form." Similar expressions are found in Minucius Felix. In no part of Aristides' Apology
is there any mention of the pre-Christian appearance of the Logos. The writer merely speaks
of the revelation of the Son of God in Jesus Christ.]

[Footnote 449: We seldom receive an answer to the question as to why this or that particular
occurrence should have been prophesied. According to the ideas of the Apologists, however,
we have hardly a right to put that question; for, since the value of the historical consists
in its having been predicted, its content is of no importance. The fact that Jesus finds the
she-ass bound to a vine (Justin, Apol. I. 32) is virtually quite as important as his being
born of a virgin. Both occurrences attest the prophetic teachings of God, freedom, etc.]

[Footnote 450: In Justin's polemical works this must have appeared in a still more striking
way. Thus we find in a fragment of the treatise [Greek: pros Markiôna], quoted by Irenæus (IV.
6. 2), the sentence "unigenitus filius venit ad nos, suum plasma in semetipsum recapitulans."
So the theologoumenon of the recapitulatio per Christum already appeared in Justin. (Vide also
Dial. c. Tryph. 100.) If we compare Tertullian's Apologeticum with his Antignostic writings
we easily see how impossible it is to determine from that work the extent of his Christian
faith and knowledge. The same is probably the case, though to a less extent, with Justin's
apologetic writings.]

[Footnote 451: Christians do not place a man alongside of God, for Christ is God, though indeed
a second God. There is no question of two natures. It is not the divine nature that Justin
has insufficiently emphasised--or at least this is only the case in so far as it is a second
Godhead--but the human nature; see Schultz, Gottheit Christi, p. 39 ff.]

[Footnote 452: We find allusions in Justin where the various incidents in the history of the
incarnate Logos are conceived as a series of arrangements meant to form part of the history
of salvation, to paralyse mankind's sinful history, and to regenerate humanity. He is thus
a forerunner of Irenæus and Melito.]

[Footnote 453: Even the theologoumenon of the definite number of the elect, which must be fulfilled,
is found in Justin (Apol. I. 28, 45). For that reason the judgment is put off by God (II. 7).
The Apology of Aristides contains a short account of the history of Jesus; his conception,
birth, preaching, choice of the 12 Apostles, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, sending
out of the 12 Apostles are mentioned.]

[Footnote 454: "To Justin faith is only an acknowledgment of the mission and Sonship of Christ
and a conviction of the truth of his teaching. Faith does not justify, but is merely a presupposition
of the justification which is effected through repentance, change of mind, and sinless life.
Only in so far as faith itself is already a free decision to serve God has it the value of
a saving act, which is indeed of such significance that one can say, 'Abraham was justified
by faith.' In reality, however, this took place through [Greek: metanoia]." The idea of the
new birth is exhausted in the thought: [Greek: Theos kalei eis metanoian], that of the forgiveness
of sins in the idea: "God is so good that he overlooks sins committed in a state of ignorance,
if man has changed his mind." Accordingly, Christ is the Redeemer in so far as he has brought
about all the conditions which make for repentance.]

[Footnote 455: This is in fact already the case in Justin here and there, but in the main there
are as yet mere traces of it: the Apologists are no mystics.]

[Footnote 456: If we consider how largely the demons bulked in the ideas of the Apologists,
we must rate very highly their conviction of the redeeming power of Christ and of his name,
a power continuously shown in the victories over the demons. See Justin Apol. II. 6, 8; Dial.
II, 30, 35, 39, 76, 85, 111, 121; Tertull., Apol. 23, 27, 32, 37 etc. Tatian also (16 fin.)
confirms it, and c. 12, p. 56, line 7 ff. (ed. Otto) does not contradict this.]

[Footnote 457: Von Engelhardt, Christenthum Justin's, p. 432 f., has pronounced against its
genuineness; see also my Texte und Untersuchungen I. 1, 2, p. 158. In favour of its genuineness
see Hilgenfeld, Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie, 1883, p. 26 f. The fragment is
worded as follows: [Greek: Plasas ho Theos kat' archas ton anthrôpon tês gnômês autou ta tês

[Footnote 458: Weizsäcker, Jahrbücher fur deutsche Theologie, 1867, p. 119, has with good reason
strongly emphasised this element. See also Stählin, Justin der Martyrer, 1880, p. 63 f., whose
criticism of Von Engelhardt's book contains much that is worthy of note, though it appears
to me inappropriate in the main.]

[Footnote 459: Loofs continues: "The Apologists, viewing the transference of the concept 'Son'
to the preëxistent Christ as a matter of course, enabled the Christological problem of the
4th century to be started. They removed the point of departure of the Christological speculation
from the historical Christ back into the preëxistence and depreciated the importance of Jesus'
life as compared with the incarnation. They connected the Christology with the cosmology, but
were not able to combine it with the scheme of salvation. Their Logos doctrine is not a 'higher'
Christology than the prevailing form; it rather lags behind the genuine Christian estimate
of Christ. The theological position of Irenæus and the later contemporary Church teachers.

Gnosticism and the Marcionite Church had compelled orthodox Christianity to make a selection
from tradition and to make this binding on Christians as an apostolical law. Everything that
laid claim to validity had henceforth to be legitimised by the faith, i.e., the baptismal confession
and the New Testament canon of Scripture (see above, chap. 2, under A and B). However, mere
"prescriptions" could no longer suffice here. But the baptismal confession was no "doctrine;"
if it was to be transformed into such it required an interpretation. We have shown above that
the interpreted baptismal confession was instituted as the guide for the faith. This interpretation
took its matter from the sacred books of both Testaments. It owed its guiding lines, however,
on the one hand to philosophical theology, as set forth by the Apologists, and on the other
to the earnest endeavour to maintain and defend against all attacks the traditional convictions
and hopes of believers, as professed in the past generation by the enthusiastic forefathers
of the Church. In addition to this, certain interests, which had found expression in the speculations
of the so-called Gnostics, were adopted in an increasing degree among all thinking Christians,
and also could not but influence the ecclesiastical teachers.[461] The theological labours,
thus initiated, accordingly bear the impress of great uniqueness and complexity. In the first
place, the old Catholic Fathers, Melito,[462] Rhodon,[463] Irenæus, Hippolytus, and Tertullian
were in every case convinced that all their expositions contained the universal Church faith
itself and nothing else. Though the faith is identical with the baptismal confession, yet every
interpretation of it derived from the New Testament is no less certain than the shortest formula.[464]
The creation of the New Testament furnished all at once a quite unlimited multitude of conceptions,
the whole of which appeared as "doctrines" and offered themselves for incorporation with the
"faith."[465] The limits of the latter therefore seem to be indefinitely extended, whilst on
the other hand tradition, and polemics too in many cases, demanded an adherence to the shortest
formula. The oscillation between this brief formula, the contents of which, as a rule, did
not suffice, and that fulness, which admitted of no bounds at all, is characteristic of the
old Catholic Fathers we have mentioned. In the second place, these fathers felt quite as much
need of a rational proof in their arguments with their christian opponents, as they did while
contending with the heathen;[466] and, being themselves children of their time, they required
this proof for their own assurance and that of their fellow-believers. The epoch in which men
appealed to charisms, and "knowledge" counted as much as prophecy and vision, because it was
still of them same nature, was in the main a thing of the past.[467] Tradition and reason had
taken the place of charisms as courts of appeal. But this change had neither come to be clearly
recognized,[468] nor was the right and scope of rational theology alongside of tradition felt
to be a problem. We can indeed trace the consciousness of the danger in attempting to introduce
new termini and regulations not prescribed by the Holy Scriptures.[469] The bishops themselves
in fact encouraged this apprehension in order to warn people against the Gnostics,[470] and
after the deluge of heresy, representatives of Church orthodoxy looked with distrust on every
philosophic-theological formula.[471] Such propositions of rationalistic theology as were absolutely
required, were, however, placed by Irenæus and Tertullian on the same level as the hallowed
doctrines of tradition, and were not viewed by them as something of a different nature. Irenæus
uttered most urgent warnings against subtle speculations;[472] but yet, in the naivest way,
associated with the faithfully preserved traditional doctrines and fancies of the faith theories
which he likewise regarded as tradition and which, in point of form, did not differ from those
of the Apologists or Gnostics.[473] The Holy Scriptures of the New Testament were the basis
on which Irenæus set forth the most important doctrines of Christianity. Some of these he stated
as they had been conceived by the oldest tradition (see the eschatology), others he adapted
to the new necessities. The qualitative distinction between the fides credenda and theology
was noticed neither by Irenæus nor by Hippolytus and Tertullian. According to Irenæus I. 10.
3 this distinction is merely quantitative. Here faith and theological knowledge are still completely
intermixed. Whilst stating and establishing the doctrines of tradition with the help of the
New Testament, and revising and fixing them by means of intelligent deduction, the Fathers
think they are setting forth the faith itself and nothing else. Anything more than this is
only curiosity not unattended with danger to Christians. Theology is interpreted faith.[474]

Corresponding to the baptismal confession there thus arose at the first a loose system of dogmas
which were necessarily devoid of strict style, definite principle, or fixed and harmonious
aim. In this form we find them with special plainness in Tertullian.[475] This writer was still
completely incapable of inwardly connecting his rational (Stoic) theology, as developed by
him for apologetic purposes, with the Christological doctrines of the regula fidei, which,
after the example of Irenæus, he constructed and defended from Scripture and tradition in opposition
to heresy. Whenever he attempts in any place to prove the intrinsic necessity of these dogmas,
he seldom gets beyond rhetorical statements, holy paradoxes, or juristic forms. As a systematic
thinker, a cosmologist, moralist, and jurist rather than a theosophist, as a churchman, a masterly
defender of tradition, as a Christian exclusively guided in practical life by the strict precepts
and hopes of the Gospel, his theology, if by that we understand his collective theological
disquisitions, is completely devoid of unity, and can only be termed a mixture of dissimilar
and, not unfrequently, contradictory propositions, which admit of no comparison with the older
theology of Valentinus or the later system of Origen.[476] To Tertullian everything lies side
by side; problems which chance to turn up are just as quickly solved. The specific faith of
Christians is indeed no longer, as it sometimes seems to be in Justin's case, a great apparatus
of proof for the doctrines of the only true philosophy; it rather stands, in its own independent
value, side by side with these, partly in a crude, partly in a developed form; but inner principles
and aims are nearly everywhere sought for in vain.[477] In spite of this he possesses inestimable
importance in the history of dogma; for he developed and created, in a disconnected form and
partly in the shape of legal propositions, a series of the most important dogmatic formulæ,
which Cyprian, Novatian, Hosius, and the Roman bishops of the fourth century, Ambrosius and
Leo I., introduced into the general dogmatic system of the Catholic Church. He founded the
terminology both of the trinitarian and of the Christological dogma; and in addition to this
was the first to give currency to a series of dogmatic concepts (satisfacere, meritum, sacramentum,
vitium originis etc., etc.). Finally it was he who at the very outset imparted to the type
of dogmatic that arose in the West its momentous bias in the direction of auctoritas et ratio,
and its corresponding tendency to assume a legal character (lex, formal and material), peculiarities
which were to become more and more clearly marked as time went on.[478] But, great as is his
importance in this respect, it has no connection at all with the fundamental conception of
Christianity peculiar to himself, for, as a matter of fact, this was already out of date at
the time when he lived. What influenced the history of dogma was not his Christianity, but
his masterly power of framing formulæ.

It is different with Irenæus. The Christianity of this man proved a decisive factor in the
history of dogma in respect of its content. If Tertullian supplied the future Catholic dogmatic
with the most important part of its formulæ, Irenæus clearly sketched for it its fundamental
idea, by combining the ancient notion of salvation with New Testament (Pauline) thoughts.[479]
Accordingly, as far as the essence of the matter is concerned, the great work of Irenæus is
far superior to the theological writings of Tertullian. This appears already in the task, voluntarily
undertaken by Irenæus, of giving a relatively complete exposition of the doctrines of ecclesiastical
Christianity on the basis of the New Testament, in opposition to heresy. Tertullian nowhere
betrayed a similar systematic necessity, which indeed, in the case of the Gallic bishop too,
only made its appearance as the result of polemical motives. But Irenæus to a certain degree
succeeded in amalgamating philosophic theology and the statements of ecclesiastical tradition
viewed as doctrines. This result followed (1) because he never lost sight of a fundamental
idea to which he tried to refer everything, and (2) because he was directed by a confident
view of Christianity as a religion, that is, a theory of its purpose. The first fundamental
idea, in its all-dominating importance, was suggested to Irenæus by his opposition to Gnosticism.
It is the conviction that the Creator of the world and the supreme God are one and the same.[480]
The other theory as to the aim of Christianity, however, is shared by Irenæus with Paul, Valentinus,
and Marcion. It is the conviction that Christianity is real redemption, and that this redemption
was only effected by the appearance of Christ. The working out of these two ideas is the most
important feature in Irenæus' book. As yet, indeed, he by no means really succeeded in completely
adapting to these two fundamental thoughts all the materials to be taken from Holy Scripture
and found in the rule of faith; he only thought with systematic clearness within the scheme
of the Apologists. His archaic eschatological disquisitions are of a heterogeneous nature,
and a great deal of his material, as, for instance, Pauline formulæ and thoughts, he completely
emptied of its content, inasmuch as he merely contrived to turn it into a testimony of the
oneness and absolute causality of God the Creator; but the repetition of the same main thoughts
to an extent that is wearisome to us, and the attempt to refer everything to these, unmistakably
constitute the success of his work.[481] God the Creator and the one Jesus Christ are really
the middle points of his theological system, and in this way he tried to assign an intrinsic
significance to the several historical statements of the baptismal confession. Looked at from
this point of view, his speculations were almost of an identical nature with the Gnostic.[482]
But, while he conceives Christianity as an explanation of the world and as redemption, his
Christocentric teaching was opposed to that of the Gnostics. Since the latter started with
the conception of an original dualism they saw in the empiric world a faulty combination of
opposing elements,[483] and therefore recognised in the redemption by Christ the separation
of what was unnaturally united. Irenæus, on the contrary, who began with the idea of the absolute
causality of God the Creator, saw in the empiric world faulty estrangements and separations,
and therefore viewed the redemption by Christ as the reunion of things unnaturally separated--the
"recapitulatio" ([Greek: anakephalaiôsis]).[484] This speculative thought, which involved the
highest imaginable optimism in contrast to Gnostic pessimism, brought Irenæus into touch with
certain Pauline trains of thought,[485] and enabled him to adhere to the theology of the Apologists.
At the same time it opened up a view of the person of Christ, which supplemented the great
defect of that theology,[486] surpassed the Christology of the Gnostics,[487] and made it possible
to utilise the Christological statements contained in certain books of the New Testament.[488]

So far as we know at least, Irenæus is the first ecclesiastical theologian after the time of
the Apologists (see Ignatius before that) who assigned a quite specific significance to the
person of Christ and in fact regarded it as the vital factor.[489] That was possible for him
because of his realistic view of redemption. Here, however, he did not fall into the abyss
of Gnosticism, because, as a disciple of the "elders", he adhered to the early-Christian eschatology,
and because, as a follower of the Apologists, he held, along with the realistic conception
of salvation, the other dissimilar theory that Christ, as the teacher, imparts to men, who
are free and naturally constituted for fellowship with God, the knowledge which enables them
to imitate God, and thus by their own act to attain communion with him. Nevertheless to Irenæus
the pith of the matter is already found in the idea that Christianity is real redemption, i.e.,
that the highest blessing bestowed in Christianity is the deification of human nature through
the gift of immortality, and that this deification includes the full knowledge and enjoying
of God (visio dei). This conception suggested to him the question as to the cause of the incarnation
as well as the answer to the same. The question "cur deus--homo", which was by no means clearly
formulated in the apologetic writings, in so far as in these "homo" only meant appearance among
men, and the "why" was answered by referring to prophecy and the necessity of divine teaching,
was by Irenæus made the central point. The reasons why the answer he gave was so highly satisfactory
may be stated as follows: (1) It proved that the Christian blessing of salvation was of a specific
kind. (2) It was similar in point of form to the so-called Gnostic conception of Christianity,
and even surpassed it as regards the promised extent of the sphere included in the deification.
(3) It harmonised with the eschatological tendency of Christendom, and at the same time was
fitted to replace the material eschatological expectations that were fading away. (4) It was
in keeping with the mystic and Neoplatonic current of the time, and afforded it the highest
imaginable satisfaction. (5) For the vanishing trust in the possibility of attaining the highest
knowledge by the aid of reason it substituted the sure hope of a supernatural transformation
of human nature which would even enable it to appropriate that which is above reason. (6) Lastly,
it provided the traditional historical utterances respecting Christ, as well as the whole preceding
course of history, with a firm foundation and a definite aim, and made it possible to conceive
a history of salvation unfolding itself by degrees [Greek: oikonomia Theou]. According to this
conception the central point of history was no longer the Logos as such, but Christ as the
incarnate God, while at the same time the moralistic interest was balanced by a really religious
one. An approach was thus made to the Pauline theology, though indeed in a very peculiar way
and to some extent only in appearance. A more exact representation of salvation through Christ
has, however, been given by Irenæus as follows: Incorruptibility is a habitus which is the
opposite of our present one and indeed of man's natural condition. For immortality is at once
God's manner of existence and his attribute; as a created being man is only "capable of incorruption
and immortality" ("capax incorruptionis et immortalitatis");[490] thanks to the divine goodness,
however, he is intended for the same, and yet is empirically "subjected to the power of death"
("sub condicione mortis"). Now the sole way in which immortality as a physical condition can
be obtained is by its possessor uniting himself realiter with human nature, in order to deify
it "by adoption" ("per adoptionem"), such is the technical term of Irenæus. The deity must
become what we are in order that we may become what he is. Accordingly, if Christ is to be
the Redeemer, he must himself be God, and all the stress must fall upon his birth as man. "By
his birth as man the eternal Word of God guarantees the inheritance of life to those who in
their natural birth have inherited death."[491] But this work of Christ can be conceived as
recapitulatio because God the Redeemer is identical with God the Creator; and Christ consequently
brings about a final condition which existed from the beginning in God's plan, but could not
be immediately realised in consequence of the entrance of sin. It is perhaps Irenæus' highest
merit, from a historical and ecclesiastical point of view, to have worked out this thought
in pregnant fashion and with the simplest means, i.e., without the apparatus of the Gnostics,
but rather by the aid of simple and essentially Biblical ideas. Moreover, a few decades later,
he and Melito, an author unfortunately so little known to us, were already credited with this
merit. For the author of the so-called "Little Labyrinth" (Euseb., H. E. V. 28. 5) can indeed
boast with regard to the works of Justin, Miltiades, Tatian, Clement, etc., that they declared
Christ to be God, but then continues: [Greek: Ta Eirênaiou te kai Melitônos kai tôn loipôn
tis agnoei biblia, theon kai anthrôpon katangellonta ton Christon] ("Who is ignorant of the
books of Irenæus, Melito, and the rest, which proclaim Christ to be God and man"). The progress
in theological views is very precisely and appropriately expressed in these words. The Apologists
also professed their belief in the full revelation of God upon earth, that is, in revelation
as the teaching which necessarily leads to immortality;[492] but Irenæus is the first to whom
Jesus Christ, God and man, is the centre of history and faith.[493] Following the method of
Valentinus, he succeeded in sketching a history of salvation, the gradual realising of the
[Greek: oikonomia Theou] culminating in the deification of believing humanity, but here he
always managed to keep his language essentially within the limits of the Biblical. The various
acting æons of the Gnostics became to him different stages in the saving work of the one Creator
and his Logos. His system seemed to have absorbed the rationalism of the Apologists and the
intelligible simplicity of their moral theology, just as much as it did the Gnostic dualism
with its particoloured mythology. Revelation had become history, the history of salvation;
and dogmatics had in a certain fashion become a way of looking at history, the knowledge of
God's ways of salvation that lead historically to an appointed goal.[494]

But, as this realistic, quasi-historical view of the subject was by no means completely worked
out by Irenæus himself, since the theory of human freedom did not admit of its logical development,
and since the New Testament also pointed in other directions, it did not yet become the predominating
one even in the third century, nor was it consistently carried out by any one teacher. The
two conceptions opposed to it, that of the early Christian eschatology and the rationalistic
one, were still in vogue. The two latter were closely connected in the third century, especially
in the West, whilst the mystic and realistic view was almost completely lacking there. In this
respect Tertullian adopted but little from Irenæus. Hippolytus also lagged behind him. Teachers
like Commodian, Arnobius, and Lactantius, however, wrote as if there had been no Gnostic movement
at all, and as if no Antignostic Church theology existed. The immediate result of the work
carried on by Irenæus and the Antignostic teachers in the Church consisted in the fixing of
tradition and in the intelligent treatment of individual doctrines, which gradually became
established. The most important will be set forth in what follows. On the most vital point,
the introduction of the philosophical Christology into the Church's rule of faith, see Chapter 7.

The manner in which Irenæus undertook his great task of expounding and defending orthodox Christianity
in opposition to the Gnostic form was already a prediction of the future. The oldest Christian
motives and hopes; the letter of both Testaments, including even Pauline thoughts; moralistic
and philosophical elements, the result of the Apologists' labours; and realistic and mystical
features balance each other in his treatment. He glides over from the one to the other; limits
the one by the other; plays off Scripture against reason, tradition against the obscurity of
the Scriptures; and combats fantastic speculation by an appeal sometimes to reason, sometimes
to the limits of human knowledge. Behind all this and dominating everything, we find his firm
belief in the bestowal of divine incorruptibility on believers through the work of the God-man.
This eclectic method did not arise from shrewd calculation. It was equally the result of a
rare capacity for appropriating the feelings and ideas of others, combined with the conservative
instincts that guided the great teacher, and the consequence of a happy blindness to the gulf
which lay between the Christian tradition and the world of ideas prevailing at that time. Still
unconscious of the greatest problem, Irenæus with inward sincerity sketched out that future
dogmatic method according to which the theology compiled by an eclectic process is to be nothing
else than the simple faith itself, this being merely illustrated and explained, developed and
by that very process established, as far as "stands in the Holy Scripture," and--let us add--as
far as reason requires. But Irenæus was already obliged to decline answering the question as
to how far unexplained faith can be sufficient for most Christians, though nothing but this
explanation can solve the great problems, "why more covenants than one were given to mankind,
what was the character of each covenant, why God shut up every man unto unbelief, why the Word
became flesh and suffered, why the advent of the Son of God only took place in the last times
etc." (I. 10. 3). The relation of faith and theological Gnosis was fixed by Irenæus to the
effect that the latter is simply a continuation of the former.[495] At the same time, however,
he did not clearly show how the collection of historical statements found in the confession
can of itself guarantee a sufficient and tenable knowledge of Christianity. Here the speculative
theories are as a matter of fact quite imbedded in the historical propositions of tradition.
Will these obscurities remain when once the Church is forced to compete in its theological
system with the whole philosophical science of the Greeks, or may it be expected that, instead
of this system of eclecticism and compromise, a method will find acceptance which, distinguishing
between faith and theology, will interpret in a new and speculative sense the whole complex
of tradition? Irenæus' process has at least this one advantage over the other method: according
to it everything can be reckoned part of the faith, providing it bears the stamp of truth,
without the faith seeming to alter its nature. It is incorporated in the theology of facts
which the faith here appears to be.[496] The latter, however, imperceptibly becomes a revealed
system of doctrine and history; and though Irenæus himself always seeks to refer everything
again to the "simple faith" ([Greek: philê pistis]), and to believing simplicity, that is,
to the belief in the Creator and the Son of God who became man, yet it was not in his power
to stop the development destined to transform the faith into knowledge of a theological system.
The pronounced hellenising of the Gospel, brought about by the Gnostic systems, was averted
by Irenæus and the later ecclesiastical teachers by preserving a great portion of the early
Christian tradition, partly as regards its letter, partly as regards its spirit, and thus rescuing
it for the future. But the price of this preservation was the adoption of a series of "Gnostic"
formulæ. Churchmen, though with hesitation, adopted the adversary's way of looking at things,
and necessarily did so, because as they became ever further and further removed from the early-Christian
feelings and thoughts, they had always more and more lost every other point of view. The old
Catholic Fathers permanently settled a great part of early tradition for Christendom, but at
the same time promoted the gradual hellenising of Christianity.

2. The Doctrines of the Church.

In the following section we do not intend to give a presentation of the theology of Irenæus
and the other Antignostic Church teachers, but merely to set forth those points of doctrine
to which the teachings of these men gave currency in succeeding times.

Against the Gnostic theses[497] Irenæus and his successors, apart from the proof from prescription,
adduced the following intrinsic considerations: (1) In the case of the Gnostics and Marcion
the Deity lacks absoluteness, because he does not embrace everything, that is, he is bounded
by the kenoma or by the sphere of a second God; and also because his omnipresence, omniscience,
and omnipotence have a corresponding limitation.[498] (2) The assumption of divine emanations
and of a differentiated divine pleroma represents the Deity as a composite, i.e.,[499] finite
being; and, moreover, the personification of the divine qualities is a mythological freak,
the folly of which is evident as soon as one also makes the attempt to personify the affections
and qualities of man in a similar way.[500] (3) The attempt to make out conditions existing
within the Godhead is in itself absurd and audacious.[501] (4) The theory of the passion and
ignorance of Sophia introduces sin into the pleroma itself, i.e., into the Godhead.[502] With
this the weightiest argument against the Gnostic cosmogony is already mentioned. A further
argument against the system is that the world and mankind would have been incapable of improvement,
if they had owed their origin to ignorance and sin.[503] Irenæus and Tertullian employ lengthy
arguments to show that a God who has created nothing is inconceivable, and that a Demiurge
occupying a position alongside of or below the Supreme Being is self-contradictory, inasmuch
as he sometimes appears higher than this Supreme Being, and sometimes so weak and limited that
one can no longer look on him as a God.[504] The Fathers everywhere argue on behalf of the
Gnostic Demiurge and against the Gnostic supreme God. It never occurs to them to proceed in
the opposite way and prove that the supreme God may be the Creator. All their efforts are rather
directed to show that the Creator of the world is the only and supreme God, and that there
can be no other above this one. This attitude of the Fathers is characteristic; for it proves
that the apologetico-philosophical theology was their fundamental assumption. The Gnostic (Marcionite)
supreme God is the God of religion, the God of redemption; the Demiurge is the being required
to explain the world. The intervention of the Fathers on his behalf, that is, their assuming
him as the basis of their arguments, reveals what was fundamental and what was accidental in
their religious teaching. At the same time, however, it shows plainly that they did not understand
or did not feel the fundamental problem that troubled and perplexed the Gnostics and Marcion,
viz., the qualitative distinction between the spheres of creation and redemption. They think
they have sufficiently explained this distinction by the doctrine of human freedom and its
consequences. Accordingly their whole mode of argument against the Gnostics and Marcion is,
in point of content, of an abstract, philosophico-rational kind.[505] As a rule they do not
here carry on their controversy with the aid of reasons taken from the deeper views of religion.
As soon as the rational argument fails, however, there is really an entire end to the refutation
from inner grounds, at least in the case of Tertullian; and the contest is shifted into the
sphere of the rule of faith and the Holy Scriptures. Hence, for example, they have not succeeded
in making much impression on the heretical Christology from dogmatic considerations, though
in this respect Irenæus was still very much more successful than Tertullian.[506] Besides,
in adv. Marc. II. 27, the latter betrayed what interest he took in the preëxistent Christ as
distinguished from God the Father. It is not expedient to separate the arguments advanced by
the Fathers against the Gnostics from their own positive teachings, for these are throughout
dependent on their peculiar attitude within the sphere of Scripture and tradition.

Irenæus and Hippolytus have been rightly named Scripture theologians; but it is a strange infatuation
to think that this designation characterises them as evangelical. If indeed we here understand
"evangelical" in the vulgar sense, the term may be correct, only in this case it means exactly
the same as "Catholic." But if "evangelical" signifies "early-Christian," then it must be said
that Scripture theology was not the primary means of preserving the ideas of primitive Christianity;
for, as the New Testament Scriptures were also regarded as inspired documents and were to be
interpreted according to the regula, their content was just for that reason apt to be obscured.
Both Marcion and the chiefs of the Valentinian school had also been Scripture theologians.
Irenæus and Hippolytus merely followed them. Now it is true that they very decidedly argued
against the arbitrary method of interpreting the Scriptures adopted by Valentinus, and compared
it to the process of forming the mosaic picture of a king into the mosaic picture of a fox,
and the poems of Homer into any others one might choose;[507] but they just as decidedly protested
against the rejection by Apelles and Marcion of the allegorical method of interpretation,[508]
and therefore were not able to set up a canon really capable of distinguishing their own interpretation
from that of the Gnostics.[509] The Scripture theology of the old Catholic Fathers has a twofold
aspect. The religion of the Scripture is no longer the original form; it is the mediated, scientific
one to be constructed by a learned process; it is, on its part, the strongest symptom of the
secularisation that has begun. In a word, it is the religion of the school, first the Gnostic
then the ecclesiastical. But it may, on the other hand, be a wholesome reaction against enthusiastic
excess and moralistic frigidity; and the correct sense of the letter will from the first obtain
imperceptible recognition in opposition to the "spirit" arbitrarily read into it, and at length
banish this "spirit" completely. Irenæus certainly tried to mark off the Church use of the
Scriptures as distinguished from the Gnostic practice. He rejects the accommodation theory
of which some Gnostics availed themselves;[510] he emphasises more strongly than these the
absolute sufficiency of the Scriptures by repudiating all esoteric doctrines;[511] he rejects
all distinction between different kinds of inspiration in the sacred books;[512] he lays down
the maxim that the obscure passages are to be interpreted from the clear ones, not vice versa;[513]
but this principle being in itself ambiguous, it is rendered quite unequivocal by the injunction
to interpret everything according to the rule of faith[514] and, in the case of all objectionable
passages, to seek the type.[515] Not only did Irenæus explain the Old Testament allegorically,
in accordance with traditional usage;[516] but according to the principle: "with God there
is nothing without purpose or due signification" ("nihil vacuum neque sine signo apud deum")
(IV. 21. 3), he was also the first to apply the scientific and mystical explanation to the
New Testament, and was consequently obliged to adopt the Gnostic exegesis, which was imperative
as soon as the apostolic writings were viewed as a New Testament. He regards the fact of Jesus
handing round food to those lying at table as signifying that Christ also bestows life on the
long dead generations;[517] and, in the parable of the Samaritan, he interprets the host as
the Spirit and the two denarii as the Father and Son.[518] To Irenæus and also to Tertullian
and Hippolytus all numbers, incidental circumstances, etc., in the Holy Scriptures are virtually
as significant as they are to the Gnostics, and hence the only question is what hidden meaning
we are to give to them. "Gnosticism" is therefore here adopted by the ecclesiastical teachers
in its full extent, proving that this "Gnosticism" is nothing else than the learned construction
of religion with the scientific means of those days. As soon as Churchmen were forced to bring
forward their proofs and proceed to put the same questions as the "Gnostics," they were obliged
to work by their method. Allegory, however, was required in order to establish the continuity
of the tradition from Adam down to the present time--not merely down to Christ--against the
attacks of the Gnostics and Marcion. By establishing this continuity a historical truth was
really also preserved. For the rest, the disquisitions of Irenæus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus
were to such an extent borrowed from their opponents that there is scarcely a problem that
they propounded and discussed as the result of their own thirst for knowledge. This fact not
only preserved to their works an early-Christian character as compared with those of the Alexandrians,
but also explains why they frequently stop in their positive teachings, when they believe they
have confuted their adversaries. Thus we find neither in Irenæus nor Tertullian a discussion
of the relation of the Scriptures to the rule of faith. From the way in which they appeal to
both we can deduce a series of important problems, which, however, the Fathers themselves did
not formulate and consequently did not answer.[519]

The doctrine of God was fixed by the old Catholic Fathers for the Christendom of succeeding
centuries, and in fact both the methodic directions for forming the idea of God and their results
remained unchanged. With respect to the former they occupy a middle position between the renunciation
of all knowledge--for God is not abyss and silence--and the attempt to fathom the depths of
the Godhead.[520] Tertullian, influenced by the Stoics, strongly emphasised the possibility
of attaining a knowledge of God. Irenæus, following out an idea which seems to anticipate the
mysticism of later theologians, made love a preliminary condition of knowledge and plainly
acknowledged it as the principle of knowledge.[521] God can be known from revelation,[522]
because he has really revealed himself, that is, both by the creation and the word of revelation.
Irenæus also taught that a sufficient knowledge of God, as the creator and guide, can be obtained
from the creation, and indeed this knowledge always continues, so that all men are without
excuse.[523] In this case the prophets, the Lord himself, the Apostles, and the Church teach
no more and nothing else than what must be already plain to the natural consciousness. Irenæus
certainly did not succeed in reconciling this proposition with his former assertion that the
knowledge of God springs from love resting on revelation. Irenæus also starts, as Apologist
and Antignostic, with the God who is the First Cause. Every God who is not that is a phantom;[524]
and every sublime religious state of mind which does not include the feeling of dependence
upon God as the Creator is a deception. It is the extremest blasphemy to degrade God the Creator,
and it is the most frightful machination of the devil that has produced the blasphemia creatoris.[525]
Like the Apologists, the early Catholic Fathers confess that the doctrine of God the Creator
is the first and most important of the main articles of Christian faith;[526] the belief in
his oneness as well as his absoluteness is the main point.[527] God is all light, all understanding,
all Logos, all active spirit;[528] everything anthropopathic and anthropomorphic is to be conceived
as incompatible with his nature.[529] The early-Catholic doctrine of God shows an advance beyond
that of the Apologists, in so far as God's attributes of goodness and righteousness are expressly
discussed, and it is proved in opposition to Marcion that they are not mutually exclusive,
but necessarily involve each other.[530]

In the case of the Logos doctrine also, Tertullian and Hippolytus simply adopted and developed
that of the Apologists, whilst Irenæus struck out a path of his own. In the Apologeticum (c.
21) Tertullian set forth the Logos doctrine as laid down by Tatian, the only noteworthy difference
between him and his predecessor consisting in the fact that the appearance of the Logos in
Jesus Christ was the uniform aim of his presentation.[531] He fully explained his Logos doctrine
in his work against the Monarchian Praxeas.[532] Here he created the formulæ of succeeding
orthodoxy by introducing the ideas "substance" and "person" and by framing, despite of the
most pronounced subordinationism and a purely economical conception of the Trinity, definitions
of the relations between the persons which could be fully adopted in the Nicene creed.[533]
Here also the philosophical and cosmological interest prevails; the history of salvation appears
only to be the continuation of that of the cosmos. This system is distinguished from Gnosticism
by the history of redemption appearing as the natural continuation of the history of creation
and not simply as its correction. The thought that the unity of the Godhead is shown in the
una substantia and the una dominatio was worked out by Tertullian with admirable clearness.
According to him the unfolding of this one substance into several heavenly embodiments, or
the administration of the divine sovereignty by emanated persons cannot endanger the unity;
the "arrangement of the unity when the unity evolves the trinity from itself" ("dispositio
unitatis, quando unitas ex semetipsa [trinitatem] derivat") does not abolish the unity, and,
moreover, the Son will some day subject himself to the Father, so that God will be all in all.[534]
Here then the Gnostic doctrine of æons is adopted in its complete form, and in fact Hippolytus,
who in this respect agrees with Tertullian, has certified that the Valentinians "acknowledge
that the one is the originator of all" ("[Greek: ton hena homologousin aition tôn pantôn]"),
because with them also, "the whole goes back to one" ("[Greek: to pan eis hena anatrechei]").[535]
The only difference is that Tertullian and Hippolytus limit the "economy of God" ([Greek: oikonomia
tou Theou]) to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, while the Gnostics exceed this number.[536] According
to Tertullian "a rational conception of the Trinity constitutes truth, an irrational idea of
the unity makes heresy" ("trinitas rationaliter expensa veritatem constituit, unitas irrationaliter
collecta hæresim facit") is already the watchword of the Christian dogmatic. Now what he considers
a rational conception is keeping in view the different stages of God's economy, and distinguishing
between dispositio, distinctio, numerus on the one hand and divisio on the other. At the beginning
God was alone, but ratio and sermo existed within him. In a certain sense then, he was never
alone, for he thought and spoke inwardly. If even men can carry on conversations with themselves
and make themselves objects of reflection, how much more is this possible with God.[537] But
as yet he was the only person.[538] The moment, however, that he chose to reveal himself and
sent forth from himself the word of creation, the Logos came into existence as a real being,
before the world and for the sake of the world. For "that which proceeds from such a great
substance and has created such substances cannot itself be devoid of substance." He is therefore
to be conceived as permanently separate from God "secundus a deo consititutus, perseverans
in sua forma"; but as unity of substance is to be preserved ("alius pater, alius filius, alius
non aliud"--"ego et pater unum sumus ad substantiæ unitatem, non ad numeri singularitatem dictum
est"--"tres unum sunt, non unus"--"the Father is one person and the Son is another, different
persons not different things", "I and the Father are one refers to unity of substance, not
to singleness in number"--"the three are one thing not one person"), the Logos must be related
to the Father as the ray to the sun, as the stream to the source, as the stem to the root (see
also Hippolytus, c. Noëtum 10).[539] For that very reason "Son" is the most suitable expression
for the Logos that has emanated in this way ([Greek: kata merismon]). Moreover, since he (as
well as the Spirit) has the same substance as the Father ("unius substantia" = [Greek: homoousios])
he has also the same power[540] as regards the world. He has all might in heaven and earth,
and he has had it ab initio, from the very beginning of time.[541] On the other hand this same
Son is only a part and offshoot; the Father is the whole; and in this the mystery of the economy
consists. What the Son possesses has been given him by the Father; the Father is therefore
greater than the Son; the Son is subordinate to the Father.[542] "Pater tota substantia est,
filius vero derivatio totius et portio".[543] This paradox is ultimately based on a philosophical
axiom of Tertullian: the whole fulness of the Godhead, i.e., the Father, is incapable of entering
into the finite, whence also he must always remain invisible, unapproachable, and incomprehensible.
The Divine Being that appears and works on earth can never be anything but a part of the transcendent
Deity. This Being must be a derived existence, which has already in some fashion a finite element
in itself, because it is the hypostatised Word of creation, which has an origin.[544] We would
assert too much, were we to say that Tertullian meant that the Son was simply the world-thought
itself; his insistance on the "unius substantiæ" disproves this. But no doubt he regards the
Son as the Deity depotentiated for the sake of self-communication; the Deity adapted to the
world, whose sphere coincides with the world-thought, and whose power is identical with that
necessary for the world. From the standpoint of humanity this Deity is God himself, i.e., a
God whom men can apprehend and who can apprehend them; but from God's standpoint, which speculation
can fix but not fathom, this Deity is a subordinate, nay, even a temporary one. Tertullian
and Hippolytus know as little of an immanent Trinity as the Apologists; the Trinity only appears
such, because the unity of the substance is very vigorously emphasised; but in truth the Trinitarian
process as in the case of the Gnostics, is simply the background of the process that produces
the history of the world and of salvation. This is first of all shown by the fact that in course
of the process of the world and of salvation the Son grows in his sonship, that is, goes through
a finite process;[545] and secondly by the fact that the Son himself will one day restore the
monarchy to the Father.[546] These words no doubt are again spoken not from the standpoint
of man, but from that of God; for so long as history lasts "the Son continues in his form."
In its point of departure, its plan, and its details this whole exposition is not distinguished
from the teachings of contemporaneous and subsequent Greek philosophers,[547] but merely differs
in its aim. In itself absolutely unfitted to preserve the primitive Christian belief in God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, its importance consists in its identification of the
historical Jesus with this Logos. By its aid Tertullian united the scientific, idealistic cosmology
with the utterances of early Christian tradition about Jesus in such a way as to make the two,
as it were, appear the totally dissimilar wings of one and the same building,[548] With peculiar
versatility he contrived to make himself at home in both wings.

It is essentially otherwise with the Logos doctrine of Irenæus.[549] Whereas Tertullian and
Hippolytus developed their Logos doctrine without reference to the historical Jesus, the truth
rather being that they simply add the incarnation to the already existing theory of the subject,
there is no doubt that Irenæus, as a rule, made Jesus Christ, whom he views as God and man,
the starting-point of his speculation. Here he followed the Fourth Gospel and Ignatius. It
is of Jesus that Irenæus almost always thinks when he speaks of the Logos or of the Son of
God; and therefore he does not identify the divine element in Christ or Christ himself with
the world idea or the creating Word or the Reason of God.[550] That he nevertheless makes Logos
([Greek: monogenês, prôtotokos], "only begotten," "first born") the regular designation of
Christ as the preëxistent One can only be explained from the apologetic tradition which in
his time was already recognised as authoritative by Christian scholars, and moreover appeared
justified and required by John I. 1. Since both Irenæus and Valentinus consider redemption
to be the special work of Christ, the cosmological interest in the doctrine of the second God
becomes subordinate to the soteriological. As, however, in Irenæus' system (in opposition to
Valentinus) this real redemption is to be imagined as recapitulatio of the creation, redemption
and creation are not opposed to each other as antitheses; and therefore the Redeemer has also
his place in the history of creation. In a certain sense then the Christology of Irenæus occupies
a middle position between the Christology of the Valentinians and Marcion on the one hand and
the Logos doctrine of the Apologists on the other. The Apologists have a cosmological interest,
Marcion only a soteriological, whereas Irenæus has both; the Apologists base their speculations
on the Old Testament, Marcion on a New Testament, Irenæus on both Old and New.

Irenæus expressly refused to investigate what the divine element in Christ is, and why another
deity stands alongside of the Godhead of the Father. He confesses that he here simply keeps
to the rule of faith and the Holy Scriptures, and declines speculative disquisitions on principle.
He does not admit the distinction of a Word existing in God and one coming forth from him,
and opposes not only ideas of emanation in general, but also the opinion that the Logos issued
forth at a definite point of time. Nor will Irenæus allow the designation "Logos" to be interpreted
in the sense of the Logos being the inward Reason or the spoken Word of God. God is a simple
essence and always remains in the same state; besides we ought not to hypostatise qualities.[551]
Nevertheless Irenæus, too, calls the preëxistent Christ the Son of God, and strictly maintains
the personal distinction between Father and Son. What makes the opposite appear to be the case
is the fact that he does not utilise the distinction in the interest of cosmology.[552] In
Irenæus' sense we shall have to say: The Logos is the revelation hypostasis of the Father,
"the self-revelation of the self-conscious God," and indeed the eternal self-revelation. For
according to him the Son always existed with God, always revealed the Father, and it was always
the full Godhead that he revealed in himself. In other words, he is God in his specific nature,
truly God, and there is no distinction of essence between him and God.[553] Now we might conclude
from the strong emphasis laid on "always" that Irenæus conceived a relationship of Father and
Son in the Godhead, conditioned by the essence of God himself and existing independently of
revelation. But the second hypostasis is viewed by him as existing from all eternity, just
as much in the quality of Logos as in that of Son, and his very statement that the Logos has
revealed the Father from the beginning shows that this relationship is always within the sphere
of revelation. The Son then exists because he gives a revelation. Little interested as Irenæus
is in saying anything about the Son, apart from his historical mission, naïvely as he extols
the Father as the direct Creator of the universe, and anxious as he is to repress all speculations
that lead beyond the Holy Scriptures, he could not altogether avoid reflecting on the problems:
why there is a second deity alongside of God, and how the two are related to one another. His
incidental answers are not essentially different from those of the Apologists and Tertullian;
the only distinction is this incidental character. Irenæus too looked on the Son as "the hand
of God," the mediator of creation; he also seems in one passage to distinguish Father and Son
as the naturally invisible and visible elements of God; he too views the Father as the one
who dominates all, the head of Christ, i.e., he who bears the creation and his Logos.[554]
Irenæus had no opportunity of writing against the Monarchians, and unfortunately we possess
no apologetic writings of his. It cannot therefore he determined how he would have written,
if he had had less occasion to avoid the danger of being himself led into Gnostic speculations
about æons. It has been correctly remarked that with Irenæus the Godhead and the divine personality
of Christ merely exist beside each other. He did not want to weigh the different problems,
because, influenced as he was by the lingering effects of an early-Christian, anti-theological
interest, he regarded the results of this reflection as dangerous; but, as a matter of fact,
he did not really correct the premises of the problems by rejecting the conclusions. We may
evidently assume (with Zahn) that, according to Irenæus, "God placed himself in the relationship
of Father to Son, in order to create after his image and in his likeness the man who was to
become his Son;"[555] but we ought not to ask if Irenæus understood the incarnation as a definite
purpose necessarily involved in the Sonship, as this question falls outside the sphere of Patristic
thinking. No doubt the incarnation constantly formed the preëminent interest of Irenæus, and
owing to this interest he was able to put aside or throw a veil over the mythological speculations
of the Apologists regarding the Logos, and to proceed at once to the soteriological question.[556]

Nothing is more instructive than an examination of Irenæus' views with regard to the destination
of man, the original state, the fall, and sin; because the heterogeneous elements of his "theology,"
the apologetic and moralistic the realistic, and the Biblical (Pauline), are specially apparent
here, and the inconsistencies into which he was led are very plain. But these very contradictions
were never eliminated from the Church doctrinal system of succeeding centuries and did not
admit of being removed; hence his attitude on these points is typical.[557] The apologetic
and moralistic train of thought is alone developed with systematic clearness. Everything created
is imperfect, just from the very fact of its having had a beginning; therefore man also. The
Deity is indeed capable of bestowing perfection on man from the beginning, but the latter was
incapable of grasping or retaining it from the first. Hence perfection, i.e., incorruptibility,
which consists in the contemplation of God and is conditional on voluntary obedience, could
only be the destination of man, and he must accordingly have been made capable of it.[558]
That destination is realised through the guidance of God and the free decision of man, for
goodness not arising from free choice has no value. The capacity in question is on the one
hand involved in man's possession of the divine image, which, however, is only realised in
the body and is therefore at bottom a matter of indifference; and, on the other, in his likeness
to God, which consists in the union of the soul with God's Spirit, but only comes about when
man is obedient to him. Along with this Irenæus has also the idea that man's likeness consists
in freedom. Now, as man became disobedient immediately after the creation, this likeness to
God did not become perfect.[559] Through the fall he lost the fellowship with God to which
he was destined, i.e., he is forfeit to death. This death was transmitted to Adam's whole posterity.[560]
Here Irenæus followed sayings of Paul, but adopted the words rather than the sense; for, in
the first place, like the Apologists, he very strongly emphasises the elements that palliate
man's fall[561] and, secondly, he contemplates the fall as having a teleological significance.
It is the fall itself and not, as in Paul's case, the consequences of the fall, that he thus
views; for he says that disobedience was conducive to man's development. Man had to learn by
experience that disobedience entails death, in order that he might acquire wisdom and choose
freely to fulfil the commandments of God. Further, man was obliged to learn through the fall
that goodness and life do not belong to him by nature as they do to God.[562] Here life and
death are always the ultimate question to Irenæus. It is only when he quotes sayings of Paul
that he remembers sin in connection with redemption; and ethical consequences of the fall are
not mentioned in this connection. "The original destination of man was not abrogated by the
fall, the truth rather being that the fall was intended as a means of leading men to attain
this perfection to which they were destined."[563] Moreover, the goodness of God immediately
showed itself both in the removal of the tree of life and in the sentence of temporal death.[564]
What significance belongs to Jesus Christ within this conception is clear: he is the man who
first realised in his person the destination of humanity; the Spirit of God became united with
his soul and accustomed itself to dwell in men. But he is also the teacher who reforms mankind
by his preaching, calls upon them to direct their still existing freedom to obedience to the
divine commandments, thereby restoring, i.e., strengthening, freedom, so that humanity is thus
rendered capable of receiving incorruptibility.[565] One can plainly see that this is the idea
of Tatian and Theophilus, with which Irenæus has incorporated utterances of Paul. Tertullian
and Hippolytus taught essentially the same doctrine;[566] only Tertullian beheld the image
and likeness of God expressly and exclusively in the fact that man's will and capacity are
free, and based on this freedom an argument in justification of God's ways.[567]

But, in addition to this, Irenæus developed a second train of thought. This was the outcome
of his Gnostic and realistic doctrine of recapitulation, and evinces clear traces of the influence
of Pauline theology. It is, however, inconsistent with the moralistic teachings unfolded above,
and could only be united with them at a few points. To the Apologists the proposition: "it
is impossible to learn to know God without the help of God" ("impossibile est sine deo discere
deum") was a conviction which, with the exception of Justin, they subordinated to their moralism
and to which they did not give a specifically Christological signification. Irenæus understood
this proposition in a Christological sense,[568] and at the same time conceived the blessing
of salvation imparted by Christ not only as the incorruptibility consisting in the beholding
of God bestowed on obedience IV. 20. 5-7: IV. 38, but also as the divine sonship which has
been won for us by Christ and which is realised in constant fellowship with God and dependence
on him.[569] No doubt he also viewed this divine sonship as consisting in the transformation
of human nature; but the point of immediate importance here is that it is no longer human freedom
but Christ that he contemplated in this connection. Corresponding to this he has now also a
different idea of the original destination of man, of Adam, and of the results of the fall.
Here comes in the mystical Adam-Christ speculation, in accordance with the Epistles to the
Ephesians and Corinthians. Everything, that is, the "longa hominum expositio," was recapitulated
by Christ in himself; in other words he restored humanity to what it originally was and again
included under one head what was divided.[570] If humanity is restored, then it must have lost
something before and been originally in good condition. In complete contradiction to the other
teachings quoted above, Irenæus now says: "What we had lost in Adam, namely, our possession
of the image and likeness of God, we recover in Christ."[571] Adam, however, is humanity; in
other words, as all humanity is united and renewed through Christ so also it was already summarised
in Adam. Accordingly "the sin of disobedience and the loss of salvation which Adam consequently
suffered may now be viewed as belonging to all mankind summed up in him, in like manner as
Christ's obedience and possession of salvation are the property of all mankind united under
him as their head."[572] In the first Adam we offended God by not fulfilling his commandments;
in Adam humanity became disobedient, wounded, sinful, bereft of life; through Eve mankind became
forfeit to death; through its victory over the first man death descended upon us all, and the
devil carried us all away captive etc.[573] Here Irenæus always means that in Adam, who represents
all mankind as their head, the latter became doomed to death. In this instance he did not think
of a hereditary transmission, but of a mystic unity[574] as in the case of Christ, viewed as
the second Adam. The teachings in III. 21. 10-23[575] show what an almost naturalistic shape
the religious quasi-historical idea assumed in Irenæus' mind. This is, however, more especially
evident from the assertion, in opposition to Tatian, that unless Adam himself had been saved
by Christ, God would have been overcome by the devil.[576] It was merely his moralistic train
of thought that saved him from the conclusion that there is a restoration of all individual men.

This conception of Adam as the representative of humanity corresponds to Irenæus' doctrine
of the God-man. The historical importance of this author lies in the development of the Christology.
At the present day, ecclesiastical Christianity, so far as it seriously believes in the unity
of the divine and human in Jesus Christ and deduces the divine manhood from the work of Christ
as his deification, still occupies the same standpoint as Irenæus did. Tertullian by no means
matched him here; he too has the formula in a few passages, but he cannot, like Irenæus, account
for its content. On the other hand we owe to him the idea of the "two natures," which remain
in their integrity--that formula which owes its adoption to the influence of Leo I. and at
bottom contradicts Irenæus' thought "the Son of God became the Son of man," ("filius dei factus
filius hominis"). Finally, the manner in which Irenæus tried to interpret the historical utterances
about Jesus Christ from the standpoint of the Divine manhood idea, and to give them a significance
in regard to salvation is also an epoch-making fact.

"Filius dei filius hominis factus," "it is one and the same Jesus Christ, not a Jesus and a
Christ, nor a mere temporary union of an æon and a man, but one and the same person, who created
the world, was born, suffered, and ascended"--this along with the dogma of God the Creator
is the cardinal doctrine of Irenæus:[577] "Jesus Christ truly man and truly God" ("Jesus Christus,
vere homo, vere deus").[578] It is only the Church that adheres to this doctrine, for "none
of the heretics hold the opinion that the Word of God became flesh" ("secundum nullam sententiam
hæreticorum verbum dei caro factum est").[579] What therefore has to be shown is (1) that Jesus
Christ is really the Word of God, i.e., is God, (2) that this Word really became man and (3)
that the incarnate Word is an inseparable unity. Irenæus maintains the first statement as well
against the "Ebionites" as against the Valentinians who thought that Christ's advent was the
descent of one of the many æons. In opposition to the Ebionites he emphasises the distinction
between natural and adopted Sonship, appeals to the Old Testament testimony in favour of the
divinity of Christ,[580] and moreover argues that we would still be in the bondage of the old
disobedience, if Jesus Christ had only been a man.[581] In this connection he also discussed
the birth from the virgin.[582] He not only proved it from prophecy, but his recapitulation
theory also suggested to him a parallel between Adam and Eve on the one hand and Christ and
Mary on the other, which included the birth from the virgin.[583] He argues in opposition to
the Valentinians that it was really the eternal Word of God himself, who was always with God
and always present to the human race, that descended.[584] He who became man was not a being
foreign to the world--this is said in opposition to Marcion--but the Lord of the world and
humanity, the Son of God, and none other. The reality of the body of Christ, i.e., the essential
identity of the humanity of Christ with our own, was continually emphasised by Irenæus, and
he views the whole work of salvation as dependent on this identity.[585] In the latter he also
includes the fact that Jesus must have passed through and been subjected to all the conditions
of a complete human life from birth to old age and death.[586] Jesus Christ is therefore the
Son of God who has really become the Son of man; and these are not two Christs but one, in
whom the Logos is permanently united with humanity.[587] Irenæus called this union "union of
the Word of God with the creature" ("adunitio verbi dei ad plasma")[588] and "blending and
communion of God and man" ("commixtio et communio dei et hominis")[589] without thereby describing
it any more clearly.[590] He views it as perfect, for, as a rule, he will not listen to any
separation of what was done by the man Jesus and by God the Word.[591] The explicit formula
of two substances or natures in Christ is not found in Irenæus; but Tertullian already used
it. It never occurred to the former, just because he was not here speaking as a theologian,
but expressing his belief.[592] In his utterances about the God-man Tertullian closely imitates
Irenæus. Like the latter he uses the expression "man united with God" ("homo deo mixtus")[593]
and like him he applies the predicates of the man to the Son of God.[594] But he goes further,
or rather, in the interest of formal clearness, he expresses the mystery in a manner which
shows that he did not fully realise the religious significance of the proposition, "the Son
of God made Son of man" ("filius dei filius hominis factus"). He speaks of a "corporal and
spiritual, i.e., divine, substance of the Lord", ("corporalis et spiritalis (i.e., divina)
substantia domini")[595] of "either substance of the flesh and spirit of Christ" ("utraque
substantia et carnis et spiritus Christi"), of the "creation of two substances which Christ
himself also possesses," ("conditio duarum substantiarum, quas Christus et ipse gestat")[596]
and of the "twofold condition not blended but united in one person--God and man" ("duplex status
non confusus sed conjunctus in una persona--deus et homo".)[597] Here we already have in a
complete form the later Chalcedonian formula of the two substances in one person.[598] At the
same time, however, we can clearly see that Tertullian went beyond Irenæus in his exposition.[599]
He was, moreover, impelled to combat an antagonistic principle. Irenæus had as yet no occasion
to explain in detail that the proposition "the Word became flesh" ("verbum caro factum") denoted
no transformation. That he excludes the idea of change, and that he puts stress on the Logos'
assumption of flesh from the Virgin is shown by many passages.[600] Tertullian, on the other
hand, was in the first place confronted by (Gnostic) opponents who understood John's statement
in the sense of the Word's transforming himself into flesh, and therefore argued against the
"assumption of flesh from the Virgin" ("assumptio carnis ex virgine");[601] and, in the second
place, he had to do with Catholic Christians who indeed admitted the birth from the Virgin,
but likewise assumed a change of God into flesh, and declared the God thus invested with flesh
to be the Son.[602] In this connection the same Tertullian, who in the Church laid great weight
on formulæ like "the crucified God," "God consented to be born" ("deus crucifixus," "nasci
se voluit deus") and who, impelled by opposition to Marcion and by his apologetic interest,
distinguished the Son as capable of suffering from God the Father who is impassible, and imputed
to him human weaknesses--which was already a further step,--sharply emphasised the "distinct
function" ("distincte agere") of the two substances in Christ and thus separated the persons.
With Tertullian the interest in the Logos doctrine, on the one hand, and in the real humanity,
on the other, laid the basis of that conception of Christology in accordance with which the
unity of the person is nothing more than an assertion. The "deus factus homo" ("verbum caro
factus") presents quite insuperable difficulties, as soon as "theology" can no longer be banished.
Tertullian smoothed over these difficulties by juristic distinctions, for all his elucidations
of "substance" and "person" are of this nature.

A somewhat paradoxical result of the defence of the Logos doctrine in the struggle against
the "Patripassians" was the increased emphasis that now began to be laid on the integrity and
independence of the human nature in Christ. If the only essential result of the struggle with
Gnosticism was to assert the substantial reality of Christ's body, it was Tertullian who distinguished
what Christ did as man from what he did as God in order to prove that he was not a tertium
quid. The discriminating intellect which was forced to receive a doctrine as a problem could
not proceed otherwise. But, even before the struggle with Modalism, elements were present which
repressed the naïve confidence of the utterances about the God-man. If I judge rightly, there
were two features in Irenæus both of which resulted in a splitting up of the conception of
the perfect unity of Christ's person. The first was the intellectual contemplation of the perfect
humanity of Jesus, the second was found in certain Old and New Testament texts and the tradition
connected with these.[603] With regard to the first we may point out that Irenæus indeed regarded
the union of the human and divine as possible only because man, fashioned from the beginning
by and after the pattern of the Logos, was an image of the latter and destined for union with
God. Jesus Christ is the realisation of our possession of God's image;[604] but this thought,
if no further developed, may be still united with the Logos doctrine in such a way that it
does not interfere with it, but serves to confirm it. The case becomes different when it is
not only shown that the Logos was always at work in the human race, but that humanity was gradually
more and more accustomed by him (in the patriarchs and prophets) to communion with God,[605]
till at last the perfect man appeared in Christ. For in this view it might appear as if the
really essential element in Jesus Christ were not the Logos, who has become the new Adam, but
the new Adam, who possesses the Logos. That Irenæus, in explaining the life of Jesus as that
of Adam according to the recapitulation theory, here and there expresses himself as if he were
speaking of the perfect man, is undeniable: If the acts of Christ are really to be what they
seem, the man concerned in them must be placed in the foreground. But how little Irenæus thought
of simply identifying the Logos with the perfect man is shown by the passage in III. 19. 3
where he writes: "[Greek: hôsper gar ên anthrôpos hina peirasthê, houtô kai logos hina doxasthê.
êsychazontos men tou logou en tô peirazesthai kai staurousthai kai apothnêskein sugginomenou
de tô anthrôpô en tô nikan kai hypomenein kai chrêsteuesthai kai anistasthai kai analambanesthai]"
("For as he was man that he might be tempted, so also he was the Logos that he might be glorified.
The Logos remained quiescent during the process of temptation, crucifixion and death, but aided
the human nature when it conquered, and endured, and performed deeds of kindness, and rose
again from the dead, and was received up into heaven"). From these words it is plain that Irenæus
preferred to assume that the divine and human natures existed side by side, and consequently
to split up the perfect unity, rather than teach a mere ideal manhood which would be at the
same time a divine manhood. The "discrete agere" of the two natures proves that to Irenæus
the perfect manhood of the incarnate Logos was merely an incidental quality he possessed. In
reality the Logos is the perfect man in so far as his incarnation creates the perfect man and
renders him possible, or the Logos always exists behind Christ the perfect man. But nevertheless
this very way of viewing the humanity in Christ already compelled Irenæus to limit the "deus
crucifixus" and to lay the foundation for Tertullian's formulæ. With regard to the second point
we may remark that there were not a few passages in both Testaments where Christ appeared as
the man chosen by God and anointed with the Spirit. These as well as the corresponding language
of the Church were the greatest difficulties in the way of the Logos Christology. Of what importance
is an anointing with the Spirit to him who is God? What is the meaning of Christ being born
by the power of the Holy Ghost? Is this formula compatible with the other, that he as the Logos
himself assumed flesh from the Virgin etc.? Irenæus no doubt felt these difficulties. He avoided
them (III. 9. 3) by referring the bestowal of the Spirit at baptism merely to the man Jesus,
and thus gave his own approval to that separation which appeared to him so reprehensible in
the Gnostics.[606] This separation indeed rescued to future ages the minimum of humanity that
was to be retained in the person of Christ, but at the same time it laid the foundation of
those differentiating speculations, which in succeeding times became the chief art and subject
of dispute among theologians. The fact is that one cannot think in realistic fashion of the
"deus homo factus" without thinking oneself out of it. It is exceedingly instructive to find
that, in some passages, even a man like Irenæus was obliged to advance from the creed of the
one God-man to the assumption of two independent existences in Christ, an assumption which
in the earlier period has only "Gnostic" testimony in its favour. Before Irenæus' day, in fact,
none but these earliest theologians taught that Jesus Christ had two natures, and ascribed
to them particular actions and experiences. The Gnostic distinction of the Jesus patibilis
("capable of suffering") and the Christ [Greek: apathês] ("impassible") is essentially identical
with the view set forth by Tertullian adv. Prax., and this proves that the doctrine of the
two natures is simply nothing else than the Gnostic, i.e., scientific, adaptation of the formula:
"filius dei filius hominis factus." No doubt the old early-Christian interest still makes itself
felt in the assertion of the one person. Accordingly we can have no historical understanding
of Tertullian's Christology or even of that of Irenæus without taking into account, as has
not yet been done, the Gnostic distinction of Jesus and Christ, as well as those old traditional
formulæ: "deus passus, deus crucifixus est" ("God suffered, God was crucified").[607]

But beyond doubt the prevailing conception of Christ in Irenæus is the idea that there was
the most complete unity between his divine and human natures; for it is the necessary consequence
of his doctrine of redemption, that "Jesus Christus factus est, quod sumus nos, uti nos perficeret
esse quod et ipse"[608] ("Jesus Christ became what we are in order that we might become what
he himself is"). But, in accordance with the recapitulation theory, Irenæus developed the "factus
est quod sumus nos" in such a way that the individual portions of the life of Christ, as corresponding
to what we ought to have done but did not do, receive the value of saving acts culminating
in the death on the cross. Thus he not only regards Jesus Christ as "salvation and saviour
and saving" ("salus et salvator et salutare"),[609] but he also views his whole life as a work
of salvation. All that has taken place between the conception and the ascension is an inner
necessity in this work of salvation. This is a highly significant advance beyond the conception
of the Apologists. Whilst in their case the history of Jesus seems to derive its importance
almost solely from the fulfilment of prophecy, it acquires in Irenæus an independent and fundamental
significance. Here also we recognise the influence of "Gnosis," nay, in many places he uses
the same expressions as the Gnostics, when he sees salvation accomplished, on the one hand,
in the mere appearance of Jesus Christ as the second Adam, and on the other, in the simple
acknowledgment of this appearance.[610] But he is distinguished from them by the fact that
he decidedly emphasises the personal acts of Jesus, and that he applies the benefits of Christ's
work not to the "pneumatic" ipso facto, but in principle to all men, though practically only
to those who listen to the Saviour's words and adorn themselves with works of righteousness.[611]
Irenæus presented this work of Christ from various points of view. He regards it as the realisation
of man's original destiny, that is, being in communion with God, contemplating God, being imperishable
like God; he moreover views it as the abolition of the consequences of Adam's disobedience,
and therefore as the redemption of men from death and the dominion of the devil; and finally
he looks upon it as reconciliation with God. In all these conceptions Irenæus fell back upon
the person of Christ. Here, at the same time, he is everywhere determined by the content of
Biblical passages; in fact it is just the New Testament that leads him to these considerations,
as was first the case with the Valentinians before him. How uncertain he still is as to their
ecclesiastical importance is shown by the fact that he has no hesitation in reckoning the question,
as to why the Word of God became flesh and suffered, among the articles that are a matter of
consideration for science, but not for the simple faith (I. 10. 3). Here, therefore, he still
maintains the archaic standpoint according to which it is sufficient to adhere to the baptismal
confession and wait for the second coming of Christ along with the resurrection of the body.
On the other hand, Irenæus did not merely confine himself to describing the fact of redemption,
its content and its consequences; but he also attempted to explain the peculiar nature of this
redemption from the essence of God and the incapacity of man, thus solving the question "cur
deus homo" in the highest sense.[612] Finally, he adopted from Paul the thought that Christ's
real work of salvation consists in his death on the cross; and so he tried to amalgamate the
two propositions, "filius dei filius hominis factus est propter nos" ("the Son of God became
Son of man for us") and "filius dei passus est propter nos" ("the Son of God suffered for us")
as the most vital ones. He did not, however, clearly show which of these doctrines is the more
important. Here the speculation of Irenæus is already involved in the same ambiguity as was
destined to be the permanent characteristic of Church speculation as to Christ's work in succeeding
times. For on the one hand, Paul led one to lay all the emphasis on the death on the cross,
and on the other, the logical result of dogmatic thinking only pointed to the appearance of
God in the flesh, but not to a particular work of Christ that had not been already involved
in the appearance of the Divine Teacher himself. Still, Irenæus contrived to reconcile the
discrepancy better than his successors, because, being in earnest with his idea of Christ as
the second Adam, he was able to contemplate the whole life of Jesus as redemption in so far
as he conceived it as a recapitulation. We see this at once not only from his conception of
the virgin birth as a fact of salvation, but also from his way of describing redemption as
deliverance from the devil. For, as the birth of Christ from the Virgin Mary is the recapitulating
counterpart of Adam's birth from the virgin earth, and as the obedience of the mother of Jesus
is the counterpart of Eve's disobedience, so the story of Jesus' temptation is to him the recapitulating
counterpart of the story of Adam's temptation. In the way that Jesus overcame the temptation
by the devil (Matt. IV.) Irenæus already sees the redemption of mankind from Satan; even then
Jesus bound the strong one. But, whereas the devil seized upon man unlawfully and deceitfully,
no injustice, untruthfulness, or violence is displayed in the means by which Jesus resisted
Satan's temptation.[613] As yet Irenæus is quite as free from the thought that the devil has
real rights upon man, as he is from the immoral idea that God accomplished his work of redemption
by an act of deceit. But, on the strength of Pauline passages, many of his teachings rather
view redemption from the devil as accomplished by the death of Christ, and accordingly represent
this death as a ransom paid to the "apostasy" for men who had fallen into captivity. He did
not, however, develop this thought any further.[614]

His idea of the reconciliation of God is just as rudimentary, and merely suggested by Biblical
passages. He sometimes saw the means of reconciliation solely in obedience and in the "righteous
flesh" as such, at other times in the "wood." Here also the recapitulation theory again appears:
through disobedience at the tree Adam became a debtor to God, and through obedience at the
tree God is reconciled.[615] But teachings as to vicarious suffering on the part of Christ
are not found in Irenæus, and his death is seldom presented from the point of view of a sacrifice
offered to God.[616] According to this author the reconciliation virtually consists in Christ's
restoring man to communion and friendship with God and procuring forgiveness of sins; he very
seldom speaks of God being offended through Adam's sin (V. 16. 3). But the incidental mention
of the forgiveness of sins resulting from the redemption by Christ has not the meaning of an
abolition of sin. He connects the redemption with this only in the form of Biblical and rhetorical
phrases; for the vital point with him is the abolition of the consequences of sin, and particularly
of the sentence of death.[617] Here we have the transition to the conception of Christ's work
which makes this appear more as a completion than as a restoration. In this connection Irenæus
employed the following categories: restoring of the likeness of God in humanity; abolition
of death; connection and union of man with God; adoption of men as sons of God and as gods;
imparting of the Spirit who now becomes accustomed to abide with men;[618] imparting of a knowledge
of God culminating in beholding him; bestowal of everlasting life. All these are only the different
aspects of one and the same blessing, which, being of a divine order, could only be brought
to us and implanted in our nature by God himself. But inasmuch as this view represents Christ
not as performing a reconciling but a perfecting work, his acts are thrust more into the background;
his work is contained in his constitution as the God-man. Hence this work has a universal significance
for all men, not only as regards the present, but as regards the past from Adam downwards,
in so far as they "according to their virtue in their generation have not only feared but also
loved God, and have behaved justly and piously towards their neighbours, and have longed to
see Christ and to hear his voice."[619] Those redeemed by Jesus are immediately joined by him
into a unity, into the true humanity, the Church, whose head he himself is.[620] This Church
is the communion of the Sons of God, who have attained to a contemplation of him and have been
gifted with everlasting life. In this the work of Christ the God-man is fulfilled.

In Tertullian and Hippolytus, as the result of New Testament exegesis, we again find the same
aspects of Christ's work as in Irenæus, only with them the mystical form of redemption recedes
into the background.[621]

Nevertheless the eschatology as set forth by Irenæus in the fifth Book by no means corresponds
to this conception of the work of Christ as a restoring and completing one; it rather appears
as a remnant of antiquity directly opposed to the speculative interpretation of redemption,
but protected by the regula fidei, the New Testament, especially Revelation, and the material
hopes of the great majority of Christians. But it would be a great mistake to assume that Irenæus
merely repeated the hopes of an earthly kingdom just because he still found them in tradition,
and because they were completely rejected by the Gnostics and guaranteed by the regula and
the New Testament.[622] The truth rather is that he as well as Melito, Hippolytus, Tertullian,
Lactantius, Commodian, and Victorinus lived in these hopes no less than did Papias, the Asia
Minor Presbyters and Justin.[623] But this is the clearest proof that all these theologians
were but half-hearted in their theology, which was forced upon them, in defence of the traditional
faith, by the historical situation in which they found themselves. The Christ, who will shortly
come to overcome Antichrist, overthrow the Roman empire, establish in Jerusalem a kingdom of
glory, and feed believers with the fat of a miraculously fruitful earth, is in fact a quite
different being from the Christ who, as the incarnate God, has already virtually accomplished
his work of imparting perfect knowledge and filling mankind with divine life and incorruptibility.
The fact that the old Catholic Fathers have both Christs shows more clearly than any other
the middle position that they occupy between the acutely hellenised Christianity of the theologians,
i.e., the Gnostics, and the old tradition of the Church. We have indeed seen that the twofold
conception of Christ and his work dates back to the time of the Apostles, for there is a vast
difference between the Christ of Paul and the Christ of the supposedly inspired Jewish Apocalypses;
and also that the agency in producing this conjunction may be traced back to the oldest time;
but the union of a precise Christological Gnosis, such as we find in Irenæus and Tertullian,
with the retention in their integrity of the imaginative series of thoughts about Antichrist,
Christ as the warrior hero, the double resurrection, and the kingdom of glory in Jerusalem,
is really a historical novelty. There is, however, no doubt that the strength of the old Catholic
theology in opposition to the Gnostics lies in the accomplishment of this union, which, on
the basis of the New Testament, appeared to the Fathers possible and necessary. For it is not
systematic consistency that secures the future of a religious conception within a church, but
its elasticity, and its richness in dissimilar trains of thought. But no doubt this must be
accompanied by a firm foundation, and this too the old Catholic Fathers possessed--the church
system itself.

As regards the details of the eschatological hopes, they were fully set forth by Irenæus himself
in Book V. Apart from the belief that the returning Nero would be the Antichrist, an idea spread
in the West during the third century by the Sibylline verses and proved from Revelation, the
later teachers who preached chiliastic hopes did not seriously differ from the Gallic bishop;
hence the interpretation of Revelation is in its main features the same. It is enough therefore
to refer to the fifth Book of Irenæus.[624] There is no need to show in detail that chiliasm
leads to a peculiar view of history, which is as much opposed to that resulting from the Gnostic
theory of redemption, as this doctrine itself forbids the hope of a bliss to be realised in
an earthly kingdom of glory. This is not the proper place to demonstrate to what extent the
two have been blended, and how the chiliastic scheme of history has been emptied of its content
and utilised in the service of theological apologetics.

But the Gnostics were not the only opponents of chiliasm. Justin, even in his time, knew orthodox
Christians who refused to believe in an earthly kingdom of Christ in Jerusalem, and Irenæus
(V. 33 ff.), Tertullian, and Hippolytus[625] expressly argued against these. Soon after the
middle of the second century, we hear of an ecclesiastical party in Asia Minor, which not only
repudiated chiliasm, but also rejected the Revelation of John as an untrustworthy book, and
subjected it to sharp criticism. These were the so-called Alogi.[626] But in the second century
such Christians were still in the minority in the Church. It was only in the course of the
third century that chiliasm was almost completely ousted in the East. This was the result of
the Montanistic controversy and the Alexandrian theology. In the West, however, it was only
threatened. In this Church the first literary opponent of chiliasm and of the Apocalypse appears
to have been the Roman Presbyter Caius. But his polemic did not prevail. On the other hand
the learned bishops of the East in the third century used their utmost efforts to combat and
extirpate chiliasm. The information given to us by Eusebius (H. E. VII. 24), from the letters
of Dionysius of Alexandria, about that father's struggles with whole communities in Egypt,
who would not give up chiliasm, is of the highest interest. This account shews that wherever
philosophical theology had not yet made its way the chiliastic hopes were not only cherished
and defended against being explained away, but were emphatically regarded as Christianity itself.[627]
Cultured theologians were able to achieve the union of chiliasm and religious philosophy; but
the "simplices et idiotæ" could only understand the former. As the chiliastic hopes were gradually
obliged to recede in exactly the same proportion as philosophic theology became naturalised,
so also their subsidence denotes the progressive tutelage of the laity. The religion they understood
was taken from them, and they received in return a faith they could not understand; in other
words, the old faith and the old hopes decayed of themselves and the authority of a mysterious
faith took their place. In this sense the extirpation or decay of chiliasm is perhaps the most
momentous fact in the history of Christianity in the East. With chiliasm men also lost the
living faith in the nearly impending return of Christ, and the consciousness that the prophetic
spirit with its gifts is a real possession of Christendom. Such of the old hopes as remained
were at most particoloured harmless fancies which, when allowed by theology, were permitted
to be added to dogmatics. In the West, on the contrary, the millennial hopes retained their
vigour during the whole third century; we know of no bishop there who would have opposed chiliasm.
With this, however, was preserved a portion of the earliest Christianity which was to exercise
its effects far beyond the time of Augustine.

Finally, we have still to treat of the altered conceptions regarding the Old Testament which
the creation of the New produced among the early-Catholic Fathers. In the case of Barnabas
and the Apologists we became acquainted with a theory of the Old Testament which represented
it as the Christian book of revelation and accordingly subjected it throughout to an allegorical
process. Here nothing specifically new could be pointed out as having been brought by Christ.
Sharply opposed to this conception was that of Marcion, according to which the whole Old Testament
was regarded as the proclamation of a Jewish God hostile to the God of redemption. The views
of the majority of the Gnostics occupied a middle position between the two notions. These distinguished
different components of the Old Testament, some of which they traced to the supreme God himself
and others to intermediate and malevolent beings. In this way they both established a connection
between the Old Testament, and the Christian revelation and contrived to show that the latter
contained a specific novelty. This historico-critical conception, such as we specially see
it in the epistle of Ptolemy to Flora, could not be accepted by the Church because it abolished
strict monotheism and endangered the proof from prophecy. No doubt, however, we already find
in Justin and others the beginning of a compromise, in so far as a distinction was made between
the moral law of nature contained in the Old Testament--the Decalogue--and the ceremonial law;
and in so far as the literal interpretation of the latter, for which a pedagogic significance
was claimed, was allowed in addition to its typical or Christian sense. With this theory it
was possible, on the one hand, to do some sort of justice to the historical position of the
Jewish people, and on the other, though indeed in a meagre fashion, to give expression to the
novelty of Christianity. The latter now appears as the new law or the law of freedom, in so
far as the moral law of nature had been restored in its full purity without the burden of ceremonies,
and a particular historical relation to God was allowed to the Jewish nation, though indeed
more a wrathful than a covenant one. For the ceremonial regulations were conceived partly as
tokens of the judgment on Israel, partly as concessions to the stiffneckedness of the people
in order to protect them from the worst evil, polytheism.

Now the struggle with the Gnostics and Marcion, and the creation of a New Testament had necessarily
a double consequence. On the one hand, the proposition that the "Father of Jesus Christ is
the creator of the world and the God of the Old Testament" required the strictest adherence
to the unity of the two Testaments, so that the traditional apologetic view of the older book
had to undergo the most rigid development; on the other hand, as soon as the New Testament
was created, it was impossible to avoid seeing that this book was superior to the earlier one,
and thus the theory of the novelty of the Christian doctrine worked out by the Gnostics and
Marcion had in some way or other to be set forth and demonstrated. We now see the old Catholic
Fathers engaged in the solution of this twofold problem; and their method of accomplishing
it has continued to be the prevailing one in all Churches up to the present time, in so far
as the ecclesiastical and dogmatic practice still continues to exhibit the inconsistencies
of treating the Old Testament as a Christian book in the strict sense of the word and yet elevating
the New above it, of giving a typical interpretation to the ceremonial law and yet acknowledging
that the Jewish people had a covenant with God.

With regard to the first point, viz., the maintenance of the unity of the two Testaments, Irenæus
and Tertullian gave a most detailed demonstration of it in opposition to Marcion,[628] and
primarily indeed with the same means as the older teachers had already used. It is Christ that
prophesied and appeared in the Old Testament; he is the householder who produced both Old and
New Testaments.[629] Moreover, as the two have the same origin, their meaning is also the same.
Like Barnabas the early Catholic Fathers contrived to give all passages in the Old Testament
a typical Christian sense: it is the same truth which we can learn from the prophets and again
from Christ and the Apostles. With regard to the Old Testament the watchword is: "Seek the
type" ("Typum quæras").[630] But they went a step further still. In opposition to Marcion's
antitheses and his demonstration that the God of the Old Testament is a petty being and has
enjoined petty, external observances, they seek to show in syntheses that the same may be said
of the New. (See Irenæus IV. 21-36). The effort of the older teachers to exclude everything
outward and ceremonial is no longer met with to the same extent in Irenæus and Tertullian,
at least when they are arguing and defending their position against the Gnostics. This has
to be explained by two causes. In the first place Judaism (and Jewish Christianity) was at
bottom no longer an enemy to be feared; they therefore ceased to make such efforts to avoid
the "Jewish" conception of the Old Testament. Irenæus, for example, emphasised in the most
naïve manner the observance of the Old Testament law by the early Apostles and also by Paul.
This is to him a complete proof that they did not separate the Old Testament God from the Christian
Deity.[631] In connection with this we observe that the radical antijudaism of the earliest
period more and more ceases. Irenæus and Tertullian admitted that the Jewish nation had a covenant
with God and that the literal interpretation of the Old Testament was justifiable. Both repeatedly
testified that the Jews had the right doctrine and that they only lacked the knowledge of the
Son. These thoughts indeed do not attain clear expression with them because their works contain
no systematic discussions involving these principles. In the second place the Church itself
had become an institution where sacred ceremonial injunctions were necessary; and, in order
to find a basis for these, they had to fall back on Old Testament commandments (see Vol. I.,
chap. 6, p. 291 ff.). In Tertullian we find this only in its most rudimentary form;[632] but
in the course of the third century these needs grew mightily[633] and were satisfied. In this
way the Old Testament threatened to become an authentic book of revelation to the Church, and
that in a quite different and much more dangerous sense than was formerly the case with the
Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists.

With reference to the second point, we may remark that just when the decay of antijudaism,
the polemic against Marcion, and the new needs of the ecclesiastical system threatened the
Church with an estimate of the Old Testament hitherto unheard of, the latter was nevertheless
thrust back by the creation and authority of the New Testament, and this consequently revived
the uncertain position in which the sacred book was henceforth to remain. Here also, as in
every other case, the development in the Church ends with the complexus oppositorum, which
nowhere allows all the conclusions to be drawn, but offers the great advantage of removing
every perplexity up to a certain point. The early-Catholic Fathers adopted from Justin the
distinction between the Decalogue, as the moral law of nature, and the ceremonial law; whilst
the oldest theologians (the Gnostics) and the New Testament suggested to them the thought of
the (relative) novelty of Christianity and therefore also of the New Testament. Like Marcion
they acknowledged the literal sense of the ceremonial law and God's covenant with the Jews;
and they sought to sum up and harmonise all these features in the thought of an economy of
salvation and of a history of salvation. This economy and history of salvation which contained
the conception of a divine accommodation and pedagogy, and which accordingly distinguished
between constituent parts of different degrees of value (in the Old Testament also), is the
great result presented in the main work of Irenæus and accepted by Tertullian. It is to exist
beside the proof from prophecy without modifying it;[634] and thus appears as something intermediate
between the Valentinian conception that destroyed the unity of origin of the Old Testament
and the old idea which neither acknowledged various constituents in the book nor recognised
the peculiarities of Christianity. We are therefore justified in regarding this history of
salvation approved by the Church, as well as the theological propositions of Irenæus and Tertullian
generally, as a Gnosis "toned down" and reconciled with Monotheism. This is shown too in the
faint gleam of a historical view that still shines forth from this "history of salvation" as
a remnant of that bright light which may be recognised in the Gnostic conception of the Old
Testament.[635] Still, it is a striking advance that Irenæus has made beyond Justin and especially
beyond Barnabas. No doubt it is mythological history that appears in this history of salvation
and the recapitulating story of Jesus with its saving facts that is associated with it; and
it is a view that is not even logically worked out, but ever and anon crossed by the proof
from prophecy; yet for all that it is development and history.

The fundamental features of Irenæus' conception are as follow: The Mosaic law and the New Testament
dispensation of grace both emanated from one and the same God, and were granted for the salvation
of the human race in a form appropriate to the times.[636] The two are in part different; but
the difference must be conceived as due to causes[637] that do not affect the unity of the
author and of the main points.[638] We must make the nature of God and the nature of man our
point of departure. God is always the same, man is ever advancing towards God; God is always
the giver, man always the receiver;[639] God leads us ever to the highest goal; man, however,
is not God from the beginning, but is destined to incorruptibility, which he is to attain step
by step, advancing from the childhood stage to perfection (see above, p. 267 f.). This progress,
conditioned by the nature and destination of man, is, however, dependent on the revelation
of God by his Son, culminating in the incarnation of the latter and closing with the subsequent
bestowal of the Spirit on the human race. In Irenæus therefore the place of the many different
revelation-hypostases of the Valentinians is occupied by the one God, who stoops to the level
of developing humanity, accommodates himself to it, guides it, and bestows on it increasing
revelations of grace.[640] The fundamental knowledge of God and the moral law of nature, i.e.,
natural morality, were already revealed to man and placed in his heart[641] by the creator.
He who preserves these, as for example the patriarchs did, is justified. (In this case Irenæus
leaves Adam's sin entirely out of sight). But it was God's will to bring men into a higher
union with himself; wherefore his Son descended to men from the beginning and accustomed himself
to dwell among them. The patriarchs loved God and refrained from injustice towards their neighbours;
hence it was not necessary that they should be exhorted with the strict letter of the law,
since they had the righteousness of the law in themselves.[642] But, as far as the great majority
of men are concerned, they wandered away from God and fell into the sorriest condition. From
this moment Irenæus, keeping strictly to the Old Testament, only concerns himself with the
Jewish people. These are to him the representatives of humanity. It is only at this period
that the training of the human race is given to them; but it is really the Jewish nation that
he keeps in view, and through this he differs very decidedly from such as Barnabas.[643] When
righteousness and love to God died out in Egypt, God led his people forth so that man might
again become a disciple and imitator of God. He gave him the written law (the Decalogue), which
contains nothing else than the moral law of nature that had fallen into oblivion.[644] But
when they made to themselves a golden calf and chose to be slaves rather than free men, then
the Word, through the instrumentality of Moses, gave to them, as a particular addition, the
commandments of slavery (the ceremonial law) in a form suitable for their training. These were
bodily commandments of bondage which did not separate them from God, but held them in the yoke.
The ceremonial law was thus a pedagogic means of preserving the people from idolatry; but it
was at the same time a type of the future. Each constituent of the ceremonial law has this
double signification, and both of these meanings originate with God, i.e., with Christ; for
"how is Christ the end of the law, if he be not the beginning of it?" ("quomodo finis legis
Christus, si non et initium eius esset") IV. 12. 4. Everything in the law is therefore holy,
and moreover we are only entitled to blame such portions of the history of the Jewish nation
as Holy Scripture itself condemns. This nation was obliged to circumcise itself, keep Sabbaths,
offer up sacrifices, and do whatever is related of it, so far as its action is not censured.
All this belonged to the state of bondage in which men had a covenant with God and in which
they also possessed the right faith in the one God and were taught before hand to follow his
Son (IV. 12, 5; "lex prædocuit hominem sequi oportere Christum"). In addition to this, Christ
continually manifested himself to the people in the prophets, through whom also he indicated
the future and prepared men for his appearance. In the prophets the Son of God accustomed men
to be instruments of the Spirit of God and to have fellowship with the Father in them; and
in them he habituated himself to enter bodily into humanity.[645] Hereupon began the last stage,
in which men, being now sufficiently trained, were to receive the "testamentum libertatis"
and be adopted as Sons of God. By the union of the Son of God with the flesh the agnitio filii
first became possible to all; that is the fundamental novelty. The next problem was to restore
the law of freedom. Here a threefold process was necessary. In the first place the Law of Moses,
the Decalogue, had been disfigured and blunted by the "traditio seniorum". First of all then
the pure moral law had to be restored; secondly, it was now necessary to extend and fulfil
it by expressly searching out the inclinations of the heart in all cases, thus unveiling the
law in its whole severity; and lastly the particularia legis, i.e., the law of bondage, had
to be abolished. But in the latter connection Christ and the Apostles themselves avoided every
transgression of the ceremonial law, in order to prove that this also had a divine origin.
The non-observance of this law was first permitted to the Gentile Christians. Thus, no doubt,
Christ himself is the end of the law, but only in so far as he has abolished the law of bondage
and restored the moral law in its whole purity and severity, and given us himself.

The question as to the difference between the New Testament and the Old is therefore answered
by Irenæus in the following manner. It consists (1) in the agnitio filii and consequent transformation
of the slaves into children of God; and (2) in the restoration of the law, which is a law of
freedom just because it excludes bodily commandments, and with stricter interpretation lays
the whole stress on the inclinations of the heart.[646] But in these two respects he finds
a real addition, and hence, in his opinion, the Apostles stand higher than the prophets. He
proves this higher position of the Apostles by a surprising interpretation of 1 Cor. XII. 28,
conceiving the prophets named in that passage to be those of the Old Testament.[647] He therefore
views the two Testaments as of the same nature, but "greater is the legislation which confers
liberty than that which brings bondage" ("maior est legisdatio quæ in libertatem, quam quæ
data est in servitutem"). Through the two covenants the accomplishment of salvation was to
be hastened "for there is one salvation and one God; but the precepts that form man are numerous,
and the steps that lead man to God are not a few;" ("una est enim salus et unus deus; quæ autem
formant hominem, præcepta multa et non pauci gradus, qui adducunt hominem ad deum"). A worldly
king can increase his benefits to his subjects; and should it not also be lawful for God, though
he is always the same, to honour continually with greater gifts those who are well pleasing
to him? (IV. 9. 3). Irenæus makes no direct statement as to the further importance which the
Jewish people have, and in any case regards them as of no consequence after the appearance
of the covenant of freedom. Nor does this nation appear any further even in the chiliastic
train of thought. It furnishes the Antichrist and its holy city becomes the capital of Christ's
earthly kingdom; but the nation itself, which, according to this theory, had represented all
mankind from Moses to Christ, just as if all men had been Jews, now entirely disappears.[648]

This conception, in spite of its want of stringency, made an immense impression, and has continued
to prevail down to the present time. It has, however, been modified by a combination with the
Augustinian doctrine of sin and grace. It was soon reckoned as Paul's conception, to which
in fact it has a distant relationship. Tertullian had already adopted it in its essential features,
amplified it in some points, and, in accordance with his Montanist ideas, enriched it by adding
a fourth stage (ab initio--Moses--Christ--Paraclete). But this addition was not accepted by
the Church.[649]

3. Results to ecclesiastical Christianity.

As we have shown, Irenæus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus had no strictly systematised theology;
they formulated theological propositions because their opponents were theologians. Hence the
result of their labours, so far as this was accepted by the Western Church of the third century,
does not appear in the adoption of a systematic philosophical dogmatic, but in theological
fragments, namely, the rule of faith fixed and interpreted in an antignostic sense[650]. As
yet the rule of faith and theology nowhere came into collision in the Western Churches of the
third century, because Irenæus and his younger contemporaries did not themselves notice any
such discrepancies, but rather imagined all their teachings to be expositions of the faith
itself, and did not trouble their heads about inconsistencies. If we wish to form a notion
as to what ideas had become universally prevalent in the Church in the middle of the third
century let us compare Cyprian's work "Testimonia", written for a layman, with Novatian's work
"De Trinitate".

In the "Testimonia" the doctrine of the two Testaments, as developed by Irenæus, forms the
framework in which the individual dogmas are set. The doctrine of God, which should have been
placed at the beginning, has been left out in this little book probably because the person
addressed required no instruction on the point. Some of the dogmas already belong to philosophical
theology in the strict sense of the word; in others we have merely a precise assertion of the
truth of certain facts. All propositions are, however, supported by passages from the two Testaments
and thereby proved.[651] The theological counterpart to this is Novatian's work "De Trinitate".
This first great Latin work that appeared in Rome is highly important. In regard to completeness,
extent of Biblical proofs, and perhaps also its influence on succeeding times, it may in many
respects be compared with Origen's work [Greek: peri archôn]. Otherwise indeed it differs as
much from that work, as the sober, meagre theology of the West, devoid of philosophy and speculation,
differs in general from that of the East. But it sums up in classic fashion the doctrines of
Western orthodoxy, the main features of which were sketched by Tertullian in his antignostic
writings and the work against Praxeas. The old Roman symbol forms the basis of the work. In
accordance with this the author gives a comprehensive exposition of his doctrine of God in
the first eight chapters. Chapters 9-28 form the main portion; they establish the correct Christology
in opposition to the heretics who look on Christ as a mere man or as the Father himself; the
Holy Scriptures furnish the material for the proofs. Chapter 29 treats of the Holy Spirit.
Chapters 30 and 31 contain the recapitulation and conclusion. The whole is based on Tertullian's
treatise against Praxeas. No important argument in that work has escaped Novatian; but everything
is extended, and made more systematic and polished. No trace of Platonism is to be found in
this dogmatic; on the contrary he employs the Stoic and Aristotelian syllogistic and dialectic
method used also by his Monarchian opponents. This plan together with its Biblical attitude
gives the work great outward completeness and certainty. We cannot help concluding that this
work must have made a deep impression wherever it was read, although the real difficulties
of the matter are not at all touched upon, but veiled by distinctions and formulæ. It probably
contributed not least to make Tertullian's type of Christology the universal Western one. This
type, however, as will be set forth in greater detail hereafter, already approximates closely
to the resolutions of Nicæa and Chalcedon.[652] Novatian adopted Tertullian's formulæ "one
substance, three persons" ("una substantia, tres personæ"), "from the substance of God" ("ex
substantia dei"), "always with the Father" ("semper apud patrem"), "God and man" ("deus et
homo"), "two substances" ("duæ substantiæ"), "one person" ("una persona"), as well as his expressions
for the union and separation of the two natures adding to them similar ones and giving them
a wider extension.[653] Taking his book in all we may see that he thereby created for the West
a dogmatic vademecum, which, from its copious and well-selected quotations from Scripture,
must have been of extraordinary service.

The most important articles which were now fixed and transferred to the general creed along
with the necessary proofs, especially in the West, were: (1) the unity of God, (2) the identity
of the supreme God and the creator of the world, that is, the identity of the mediators of
creation and redemption, (3) the identity of the supreme God with the God of the Old Testament,
and the declaration that the Old Testament is God's book of revelation, (4) the creation of
the world out of nothing, (5) the unity of the human race, (6) the origin of evil from freedom,
and the inalienable nature of freedom, (7) the two Testaments, (8) Christ as God and Man, the
unity of his personality, the truth of his divinity, the actuality of his humanity, the reality
of his fate, (9) the redemption and conclusion of a covenant through Christ as the new and
crowning manifestation of God's grace to all men, (10) the resurrection of man in soul and
body. But the transmission and interpretation of these propositions, by means of which the
Gnostic theses were overthrown, necessarily involved the transmission of the Logos doctrine;
for the doctrine of the revelation of God and of the two Testaments could not have prevailed
without this theory. How this hypothesis gained acceptance in the course of the third century,
and how it was the means of establishing and legitimising philosophical theology as part of
the faith, will be shown in the seventh chapter. We may remark in conclusion that the religious
hope which looked forward to an earthly kingdom of Christ was still the more widely diffused
among the Churches of the third century;[654] but that the other hope, viz., that of being
deified, was gaining adherents more and more. The latter result was due to men's increasing
indifference to daily life and growing aspiration after a higher one, a longing that was moreover
nourished among the more cultured by the philosophy which was steadily gaining ground. The
hope of deification is the expression of the idea that this world and human nature do not correspond
to that exalted world which man has built up within his own mind and which he may reasonably
demand to be realised, because it is only in it that he can come to himself. The fact that
Christian teachers like Theophilus, Irenæus, and Hippolytus expressly declared this to be a
legitimate Christian hope and held out a sure prospect of its fulfilment through Christ, must
have given the greatest impulse to the spread and adoption of this ecclesiastical Christianity.
But, when the Christian religion was represented as the belief in the incarnation of God and
as the sure hope of the deification of man, a speculation that had originally never got beyond
the fringe of religious knowledge was made the central point of the system and the simple content
of the Gospel was obscured.[655]

[Footnote 461: The following exposition will show how much Irenæus and the later old Catholic
teachers learned from the Gnostics. As a matter of fact the theology of Irenæus remains a riddle
so long as we try to explain it merely from the Apologists and only consider its antithetical
relations to Gnosis. Little as we can understand modern orthodox theology from a historical
point of view--if the comparison be here allowed--without keeping in mind what it has adopted
from Schleiermacher and Hegel, we can just as little understand the theology of Irenæus without
taking into account the schools of Valentinus and Marcion.]

[Footnote 462: That Melito is to be named here follows both from Eusebius, H. E. V. 28. 5,
and still more plainly from what we know of the writings of this bishop; see Texte und Untersuchungen
zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Litteratur, I. 1, 2, p. 24 ff. The polemic writings of Justin
and the Antignostic treatise of that "ancient" quoted by Irenæus (see Patr. App. Opp. ed. Gebhardt
etc. I. 2, p. 105 sq.) may in a certain sense be viewed as the precursors of Catholic literature.
We have no material for judging of them with certainty. The New Testament was not yet at the
disposal of their authors, and consequently there is a gap between them and Irenæus.]

[Footnote 463: See Eusebius, H. E. V. 13.]

[Footnote 464: Tertullian does indeed say in de præscr. 14: "Ceterum manente forma regulæ fidei
in suo ordine quantumlibet quæras, et trades, et omnem libidinem curiositatis effundas, si
quid tibi videtur vel ambiguitate pendere vel obscuritate obumbrari"; but the preceding exposition
of the regula shows that scarcely any scope remained for the "curiositas," and the one that
follows proves that Tertullian did not mean that freedom seriously.]

[Footnote 465: The most important point was that the Pauline theology, towards which Gnostics,
Marcionites, and Encratites had already taken up a definite attitude, could now no longer be
ignored. See Overbeck's Basler Univ.--Programm, 1877. Irenæus immediately shows the influence
of Paulinism very clearly.]

[Footnote 466: See what Rhodon says about the issue of his conversation with Appelles in Euseb.,
H. E. V. 13. 7: [Greek: egô de gelasas kategnôn autou, dioti dedaskalos einai legôn oun êdei
to didaskomenon hup' autou kratunein].]

[Footnote 467: On the old "prophets and teachers" see my remarks on the [Greek: Didachê], c.
11 ff., and the section, pp. 93-137, of the prolegomena to my edition of this work. The [Greek:
didaskaloi apostolikoi kai prophêtikoi] (Ep. Smyrn. ap. Euseb., H. E. IV. 15. 39) became lay-teachers
who were skilful in the interpretation of the sacred traditions.]

[Footnote 468: In the case of Irenæus, as is well known, there was absolutely no consciousness
of this, as is well remarked by Eusebius in H. E. V. 7. In support of his own writings, however,
Irenæus appealed to no charisms.]

[Footnote 469: See the passage already quoted on p. 63, note 1.]

[Footnote 470: Irenæus and Tertullian scoffed at the Gnostic terminology in the most bitter way.]

[Footnote 471: Tertullian, adv. Prax. 3: "Simplices enim quique, ne dixerim imprudentes et
idiotæ, quæ major semper credentium pars est, quoniam et ipsa regula fidei a pluribus diis
sæculi ad unicum et verum deum transfert, non intellegentes unicum quidem, sed cum sua [Greek:
oikonomia] esse credendum, expavescunt ad [Greek: oikonomian]." Similar remarks often occur
in Origen. See also Hippol., c. Noet 11.]

[Footnote 472: The danger of speculation and of the desire to know everything was impressively
emphasised by Irenæus, II. 25-28. As a pronounced ecclesiastical positivist and traditionalist,
he seems in these chapters disposed to admit nothing but obedient and acquiescent faith in
the words of Holy Scripture, and even to reject speculations like those of Tatian, Orat. 5.
Cf. the disquisitions II. 25. 3: "Si autem et aliquis non invenerit causam omnium quæ requiruntur,
cogitet, quia homo est in infinitum minor deo et qui ex parte (cf. II. 28.) acceperit gratiam
et qui nondum æqualis vel similis sit factori"; II. 26. 1: [Greek: Ameinon kai symphorôteron
idiôtas kai oligomatheis huparchein, kai dia tês agapês plêsion genesthai tou Theou ê polymatheis
kai empeirous dokountas einai, blasphêmous eis ton heautôn heuriskesthai despotên], and in
addition to this the close of the paragraph, II. 27. 1: Concerning the sphere within which
we are to search (the Holy Scriptures and "quæ ante oculos nostros occurrunt", much remains
dark to us even in the Holy Scriptures II. 28. 3); II. 28. 1 f. on the canon which is to be
observed in all investigations, namely, the confident faith in God the creator, as the supreme
and only Deity; II. 28. 2-7: specification of the great problems whose solution is hid from
us, viz., the elementary natural phenomena, the relation of the Son to the Father, that is,
the manner in which the Son was begotten, the way in which matter was created, the cause of
evil. In opposition to the claim to absolute knowledge, i.e., to the complete discovery of
all the processes of causation, which Irenæus too alone regards as knowledge, he indeed pointed
out the limits of our perception, supporting his statement by Bible passages. But the ground
of these limits, "ex parte accepimus gratiam," is not an early-Christian one, and it shows
at the same time that the bishop also viewed knowledge as the goal, though indeed he thought
it could not be attained on earth.]

[Footnote 473: The same observation applies to Tertullian, Cf. his point blank repudiation
of philosophy in de præse. 7, and the use he himself nevertheless made of it everywhere.]

[Footnote 474: In point of form this standpoint is distinguished from the ordinary Gnostic
position by its renunciation of absolute knowledge, and by its corresponding lack of systematic
completeness. That, however, is an important distinction in favour of the Catholic Fathers.
According to what has been set forth in the text I cannot agree with Zahn's judgment (Marcellus
of Ancyra, p. 235 f.): "Irenæus is the first ecclesiastical teacher who has grasped the idea
of an independent science of Christianity, of a theology which, in spite of its width and magnitude,
is a branch of knowledge distinguished from others; and was also the first to mark out the
paths of this science."]

[Footnote 475: Tertullian seems even to have had no great appreciation for the degree of systematic
exactness displayed in the disquisitions of Irenæus. He did not reproduce these arguments at
least, but preferred after considering them to fall back on the proof from prescription.]

[Footnote 476: The more closely we study the writings of Tertullian, the more frequently we
meet with inconsistencies, and that in his treatment both of dogmatic and moral questions.
Such inconsistencies could not but make their appearance, because Tertullian's dogmatising
was only incidental. As far as he himself was concerned, he did not feel the slightest necessity
for a systematic presentation of Christianity.]

[Footnote 477: With reference to certain articles of doctrine, however, Tertullian adopted
from Irenæus some guiding principles and some points of view arising from the nature of faith;
but he almost everywhere changed them for the worse. The fact that he was capable of writing
a treatise like the de præscr. hæret., in which all proof of the intrinsic necessity and of
the connection of his dogmas is wanting, shows the limits of his interests and of his understanding.]

[Footnote 478: Further references to Tertullian in a future volume. Tertullian is at the same
time the first Christian individual after Paul, of whose inward life and peculiarities we can
form a picture to ourselves. His writings bring us near himself, but that cannot be said of
Irenæus.]

[Footnote 479: Consequently the spirit of Irenæus, though indeed strongly modified by that
of Origen, prevails in the later Church dogmatic, whilst that of Tertullian is not to be traced
there.]

[Footnote 480: The supreme God is the Holy and Redeeming One. Hence the identity of the creator
of the world and the supreme God also denotes the unity of nature, morality, and revelation.]

[Footnote 481: What success the early-Christian writings of the second century had is almost
completely unknown to us; but we are justified in saying that the five books "adv. hæreses"
of Irenæus were successful, for we can prove the favourable reception of this work and the
effects it had in the 3rd and 4th centuries (for instance, on Hippolytus, Tertullian, Clement
of Alexandria, Victorinus, Marcellus of Ancyra, Epiphanius, and perhaps Alexander of Alexandria
and Athanasius). As is well known, we no longer possess a Greek manuscript, although it can
be proved that the work was preserved down to middle Byzantine times, and was quoted with respect.
The insufficient Christological and especially the eschatological disquisitions spoiled the
enjoyment of the work in later times (on the Latin Irenæus cf. the exhaustive examination of
Loof: "The Manuscripts of the Latin translation of Irenæus", in the "Studies of Church History"
dedicated to Reuter, 1887). The old Catholic works written against heretics by Rhodon, Melito,
Miltiades, Proculus, Modestus, Musanus, Theophilus, Philip of Gortyna, Hippolytus, and others
have all been just as little preserved to us as the oldest book of this kind, the Syntagma
of Justin against heresies, and the Memorabilia of Hegesippus. If we consider the criticism
to which Tatian's Christology was subjected by Arethas in the 10th century (Oratio 5; see my
Texte und Untersuchungen I. 1, 2 p. 95 ff.), and the depreciatory judgment passed on Chiliasm
from the 3rd century downwards, and if we moreover reflect that the older polemical works directed
against heretics were supplanted by later detailed ones, we have a summary of the reasons for
the loss of that oldest Catholic literature. This loss indeed makes it impossible for us to
form an exact estimate of the extent and intensity of the effect produced by any individual
writing, even including the great work of Irenæus.]

[Footnote 482: People are fond of speaking of the "Asia Minor" theology of Irenæus, ascribe
it already to his teachers, Polycarp and the presbyters, then ascend from these to the Apostle
John, and complete, though not without hesitation, the equation: John--Irenæus. By this speculation
they win simply everything, in so far as the Catholic doctrine now appears as the property
of an "apostolic" circle, and Gnosticism and Antignosticism are thus eliminated. But the following
arguments may be urged against this theory: (1) What we know of Polycarp by no means gives
countenance to the supposition that Irenæus learned more from him and his fellows than a pious
regard for the Church tradition and a collection of historical traditions and principles. (2)
The doctrine of Irenæus cannot be separated from the received canon of New Testament writings;
but in the generation before him there was as yet no such compilation. (3) The presbyter from
whom Irenæus adopted important lines of thought in the 4th book did not write till after the
middle of the second century. (4) Tertullian owes his Christocentric theology, so far as he
has such a thing, to Irenæus (and Melito?).]

[Footnote 483: Marcion, as is well known, went still further in his depreciatory judgment of
the world, and therefore recognised in the redemption through Christ a pure act of grace.]

[Footnote 484: See Molwitz, De [Greek: Anakephalaiôseôs] in Irenæi theologia potestate, Dresden,
1874.]

[Footnote 485: See, e.g., the Epistle to the Ephesians and also the Epistles to the Romans
and Galatians.]

[Footnote 486: But see the remark made above, p. 220, note 1. We might without loss give up
the half of the Apologies in return for the preservation of Justin's chief Antignostic work.]

[Footnote 487: According to the Gnostic Christology Christ merely restores the status quo ante,
according to that of Irenæus he first and alone realises the hitherto unaccomplished destination
of humanity.]

[Footnote 488: According to the Gnostic conception the incarnation of the divine, i.e., the
fall of Sophia, contains, paradoxically expressed, the element of sin; according to Irenæus'
idea the element of redemption. Hence we must compare not only the Gnostic Christ, but the
Gnostic Sophia, with the Christ of the Church. Irenæus himself did so in II. 20. 3.]

[Footnote 489: After tracing in II. 14 the origin of the Gnostic theologoumena to the Greek
philosophers Irenæus continues § 7: "Dicemus autem adversus eos: utramne hi omnes qui prædicti
sunt, cum quibus eadem dicentes arguimini (Scil. "ye Gnostics with the philosophers"), cognoverunt
veritatem aut non cognoverunt? Et si quidem cognoverunt, superflua est salvatoris in hunc mundum
descensio. Ut (lege "ad") quid enim descendebat?" It is characteristic of Irenæus not to ask
what is new in the revelations of God (through the prophets and the Logos), but quite definitely:
"Cur descendit salvator in hunc mundum?" See also lib. III. præf.: "veritas, hoc est dei filii
doctrina", III. 10. 3: "Hæc est salutis agnitio quæ deerat eis, quæ est filii del agnitio ...
agnitio salutis erat agnitio filii dei, qui et salus et salvator et salutare vere et dicitur
et est." III. 11. 3: III. 12. 7: IV. 24.]

[Footnote 490: See II. 24. 3, 4: "Non enim ex nobis neque ex nostra natura vita est; sed secundum
gratiam dei datur." Cf. what follows. 6. I: "Deus stetit in synagoga deorum ... de patre et
filio et de his, qui adoptionem perceperunt, dicit: hi autem sunt ecclesia. Hæc enim est synagoga
dei," etc.; see also what follows III. 16. 3: "Filius dei hominis filius factus, ut per eum
adoptionem percipiamus portante homine et capiente et compleciente filium dei." III. 16. 6:
"Dei verbum unigenitus, qui semper humano generi adest, unitus et consparsus suo plasmati secundum
placitum patris et caro factus, ipse est Iesus Christus dominus noster ... unus Iesus Christus,
veniens per universam dispositionem et omnia in semetipsum recapitulans. In omnibus autem est
et homo plasmatio dei, et hominem ergo in semetipsum recapitulans est, invisibilis visibilis
factus, et incomprehensibilis factus comprehensibilis, et impassibilis passibilis, et verbum
homo, universa in semetipsum recapitulans ... in semetipsum primatum assumens,.. universa attrahat
ad semetipsum apto in tempore." III. 18. 1: "Quando incarnatus est filius homo et homo factus
longam hominum expositionem in se ipso recapitulavit, in compendio nobis salutem præstans,
ut quod perdideramus in Adam id est secundum imaginem et similitudinem esse dei, hoc in Christo
Iesu reciperemus." Cf. the whole 18th chapter where the deepest thoughts of the Pauline Gnosis
of the death on the cross are amalgamated with the Gnosis of the incarnation; see especially
18. 6, 7: "[Greek: Ênôsen oun ton anthrôpon tô Theô. Ei gar mê anthrôpos enikêsen tên antipalon

nisi verbum eius communicasset nobis caro factum? Quapropter et per omnem venit ætatem, omnibus
restituens eam quæ est ad deum communionem." The Pauline ideas about sin, law, and bondage
are incorporated by Irenæus in what follows. The disquisitions in capp. 19-23 are dominated
by the same fundamental idea. In cap. 19 Irenæus turns to those who hold Jesus to be a mere
man, "perseverantes in servitute pristinæ inobedientiæ moriuntur, nondum commixti verbo dei
patris neque per filium percipientes libertatem ... privantur munere eius, quod est vita æsterna:
non recipientes autem verbum incorruptionis perseverant in carne mortali, et sunt debitores

absorbet*etur quod erat corruptibile ab incorruptela et quod erat mortale ab immortalitate,
ut filiorum adoptionem perciperemus?" III. 21. 10: [Greek: Ei toinun ho prôtos Adam esche patera

tês homoiotêtos]; III. 23. 1: IV. 38: V. 36: IV. 20: V. 16, 19-21, 22. In working out this
thought Irenæus verges here and there on soteriological naturalism (see especially the disquisitions
regarding the salvation of Adam, opposed to Tatian's views, in III. 23). But he does not fall
into this for two reasons. In the first place, as regards the history, of Jesus, he has been
taught by Paul not to stop at the incarnation, but to view the work of salvation as only completed
by the sufferings and death of Christ (See II. 20. 3: "dominus per passionem mortem destruxit
et solvit errorem corruptionemque exterminavit, et ignorantiam destruxit, vitam autem manifestavit
et ostendit veritatem et incorruptionem donavit"; III. 16. 9: III. 18. 1-7 and many other passages),
that is, to regard Christ as having performed a work. Secondly, alongside of the deification
of Adam's children, viewed as a mechanical result of the incarnation, he placed the other (apologetic)
thought, viz., that Christ, as the teacher, imparts complete knowledge, that he has restored,
i.e., strengthened the freedom of man, and that redemption (by which he means fellowship with
God) therefore takes place only in the case of those children of Adam that acknowledge the
truth proclaimed by Christ and imitate the Redeemer in a holy life (V. 1. 1.: "Non enim aliter
nos discere poteramus quæ sunt dei, nisi magister noster, verbum exsistens, homo factus fuisset.
Neque enim alias poterat enarrare nobis, quæ sunt patris, nisi proprium ipsius verbum ... Neque
rursus nos aliter discere poteramus, nisi magistrum nostrum videntes et per auditum nostrum
vocem eius percipientes, ut imitatores quidem operum, factores autem sermonum eius facti, communionem
habeamus cum ipso", and many other passages). We find a combined formula in III. 5. 3: "Christus
libertatem hominibus restauravit et attribuit incorruptelæ hæreditatem."]

[Footnote 492: Theophilus also did not see further, see Wendt, l.c., 17 ff.]

[Footnote 493: Melito's teaching must have been similar. In a fragment attributed to him (see
my Texte und Untersuchungen I. 1, 2 p. 255 ff.) we even find the expression "[Greek: hai duo
ousiai Christou]". The genuineness of the fragment is indeed disputed, but, as I think, without
grounds. It is certainly remarkable that the formula is not found in Irenæus (see details below).
The first Syriac fragment (Otto IX. p. 419) shows that Melito also views redemption as reunion
through Christ.]

[Footnote 494: The conception of the stage by stage development of the economy of God and the
corresponding idea of "several covenants" (I. 10. 3: III. 11-15 and elsewhere) denote a very
considerable advance, which the Church teachers owe to the controversy with Gnosticism, or
to the example of the Gnostics. In this case the origin of the idea is quite plain. For details
see below.]

[Footnote 495: It would seem from some passages as if faith and theological knowledge were
according to Irenæus simply related as the "is" and the "why." As a matter of fact, he did
express himself so without being really able to maintain the relationship thus fixed; for faith
itself must also to some extent include a knowledge of the reason and aim of God's ways of
salvation. Faith and theological knowledge are therefore, after all, closely interwoven with
each other. Irenæus merely sought for a clear distinction, but it was impossible for him to
find it in his way. The truth rather is that the same man, who, in opposition to heresy, condemned
an exaggerated estimate of theoretical knowledge, contributed a great deal to the transformation
of that faith into a monistic speculation.]

[Footnote 497: See Bohringer's careful reviews of the theology of Irenæus and Tertullian (Kirchengeschichte
in Biographien, Vol. I. 1st section, 1st half (2nd ed.), pp. 378-612, 2nd half, pp. 484-739).]

[Footnote 498: To the proof from prescription belong the arguments derived from the novelty
and contradictory multiplicity of the Gnostic doctrines as well as the proofs that Greek philosophy
is the original source of heresy. See Iren. II. 14. 1-6; Tertull. de præscr. 7; Apolog. 47
and other places; the Philosophoumena of Hippolytus. On Irenæus' criticism of Gnostic theology
see Kunze, Gotteslehre des Irenäus, Leipzig, 1891. p. 8 ff.]

[Footnote 499: See Irenæus II. 1. 2-4: II. 31. 1. Tertull., adv. Marc. I. 2-7. Tertullian proves
that there can be neither two morally similar, nor two morally dissimilar Deities; see also I. 15.]

[Footnote 500: See Irenæus II. 13. Tertullian (ad Valent. 4) very appropriately defined the
æons of Ptolemy as "personales substantias extra deum determinatas, quas Valentinus in ipsa
summa divinitatis ut sensus et affectus motus incluserat."]

[Footnote 501: See Irenæus, l.c., and elsewhere in the 2nd Book, Tertull. adv. Valent. in several
passages. Moreover, Irenæus still treated the first 8 Ptolemaic æons with more respect than
the 22 following, because here at least there was some appearance of a Biblical foundation.
In confuting the doctrine of æons he incidentally raised several questions (II. 17. 2), which
Church theologians discussed in later times, with reference to the Son and Spirit. "Quæritur
quemadmodum emissi sunt reliqui æones? Utrum uniti ei qui emiserit, quemadmodum a sole radii,
an efficabiliter et partiliter, uti sit unusquisque eorum separatim et suam figurationem habens,
quemadmodum ab homine homo ... Aut secundum germinationem, quemabmodum ab arbore rami? Et utrum
eiusdem substantiæ exsistebant his qui se emiserunt, an ex altera quadam substantia substantiam
habentes? Et utrum in eodem emissi sunt, ut eiusdem temporis essent sibi?... Et utrum simplices
quidam et uniformes et undique sibi æquales et similes, quemadmodum spiritus et lumina emissa
sunt, an compositi et differentes"? See also II. 17. 4: "Si autem velut a lumine lumina accensa
sunt... velut verbi gratia a facula faculæ, generatione quidem et magnitudine fortasse distabunt
ab invicem; eiusdem autem substantive cum sint cum principe emissionis ipsorum, aut omnes impassibiles
perseverant aut et pater ipsorum participabit passiones. Neque enim quæ postea accensa est
facula, alterum lumen habebit quam illud quod ante eam fuit." Here we have already a statement
of the logical reasons, which in later times were urged against the Arian doctrine.]

[Footnote 502: See Iren. II. 17. 5 and II. 18.]

[Footnote 503: See Iren. II. 4. 2.]

[Footnote 504: Tertullian in particular argued in great detail (adv. Marc. I. 9-19) that every
God must, above all, have revealed himself as a creator. In opposition to Marcion's rejection
of all natural theology, he represents this science as the foundation of all religious belief.
In this connection he eulogised the created world (I. 13) and at the same time (see also the
2nd Book) argued in favour of the Demiurge, i.e., of the one true God. Irenæus urged a series
of acute and weighty objections to the cosmogony of the Valentinians (see II. 1-5), and showed
how untenable was the idea of the Demiurge as an intermediate being. The doctrines that the
Supreme Being is unknown (II. 6), that the Demiurge is the blind instrument of higher æons,
that the world was created against the will of the Supreme God, and, lastly, that our world
is the imperfect copy of a higher one were also opposed by him with rational arguments. His
refutation of the last conception is specially remarkable (II. 7). On the idea that God did
not create the world from eternal matter see Tertull., adv. Hermog.]

[Footnote 505: But this very method of argument was without doubt specially impressive in the
case of the educated, and it is these alone of whom we are here speaking. On the decay of Gnosticism
after the end of the 2nd century, see Renan, Origines, Vol. VII., p. 113 ff.]

whereas they actually possess several, III. 16. 1, 8 and elsewhere.]

inspired. The repudiation of different kinds of inspiration in the Scriptures likewise involved
the rejection of all the critical views of the Gnostics that were concealed behind that assumption.
The Alexandrians were the first who again to some extent adopted these critical principles.]

31. 1): "De his quidem delictis, de quibus ipsæ scripturæ increpant patriarchas et prophetas,
nos non oportere exprobare eis ... de quibus autem scripturæ non inciepant (scil. delictis),
sed simpliciter sunt positæ, nos non debere fieri accusatores, sed typum quærere."]

from profane writings. Tertullian speaks of two proprietates iudaicæ literaturæ in adv. Marc.

inspiration.]

[Footnote 520: See above p. 233, note 2, Kunze, l.c.]

[Footnote 521: See Iren, II. 26. 1, 13. 4: "Sic et in reliquis omnibus nulli similis erit omnium
pater hominum pusillitati: et dicitur quidem secundum hæc propter delectionem, sentitur autem
super hæc secundum magnitudinem." Irenæus expressly says that God cannot be known as regards
his greatness, i.e. absolutely, but that he can be known as regards his love, IV. 20. 1: "Igitur
secundum magnitudem non est cognoscere deum, impossibile est enim mensurari patrem; secundum
autem dilectionem eius--hæc est enim quæ nos per verbum eius perducit ad deum--obedientes ei
semper discimus quoniam est tantus deus etc."; in IV. 20. 4 the knowledge of God "secundum
dilectionem" is more closely defined by the words "per verbum eius Iesum Christum." The statements
in §§ 5 and 6 are, however, specially important: they who are pure in heart will see God. God's
omnipotence and goodness remove the impossibility of man knowing him. Man comes to know him
gradually, in proportion as he is revealed and through love, until he beholds him in a state
of perfection. He must be in God in order to know God: [Greek: hôsper hoi blepontes to phôs

where rationalism is neutralised by mysticism we seek for in Tertullian in vain.]

[Footnote 526: See Iren., II. 1. I and the Hymn II. 30. 9.]

[Footnote 527: See Iren., III. 8. 3. Very pregnant are Irenæus' utterances in II. 34. 4 and
II. 30. 9: "Principari enim debet in omnibus et dominari voluntas dei, reliqua autem omnia
huic cedere et subdita esse et in servitium dedita" ... "substantia omnium voluntas dei;" see
also the fragment V. in Harvey, Iren., Opp. II. p. 477 sq. Because everything originates with
God and the existence of eternal metaphysical contrasts is therefore impossible the following
proposition (IV. 2, 4), which is proved from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, holds,
good: "ex una substantia esse omnia, id est Abraham et Moysem et prophetas, etiam ipsum dominum."]

[Footnote 528: See Iren. II. 28. 4, 5: IV. 11. 2.]

[Footnote 529: Tertullian also makes the same demand (e.g. adv. Marc. II. 27); for his assertion
"deum corpus esse" (adv. Prax. 7: "Quis enim negabil, deum corpus esse, etsi deus spiritus
est? spiritus enim corpus sui generis in sua effigie") must be compared with his realistic
doctrine of the soul (de anima 6) as well as with the proposition formulated in de carne 11:
"omne quod est, corpus est sui generis; nihil est incorporale, nisi quod non est." Tertullian
here followed a principle of Stoic philosophy, and in this case by no means wished to teach
that the Deity has a human form, since he recognised that man's likeness to God consists merely
in his spiritual qualities. On the contrary Melito ascribed to God a corporeal existence of
a higher type (Eusebius mentions a work of this bishop under the title "[Greek: ho peri ensômatou
Theou logos],") and Origen reckoned him among the teachers who recognised that man had also
a likeness to God in form (in body); see my Texte und Untersuchungen I. 1. 2, pp. 243, 248.
In the second century the realistic eschatological ideas no doubt continued to foster in wide
circles the popular idea that God had a form and a kind of corporeal existence. A middle position
between these ideas and that of Tertullian and the Stoics seems to have been taken up by Lactantius
(Instit. div. VII. 9, 21; de ira dei 2. 18.).]

[Footnote 530: See Iren., III. 25. 2; Tertull., adv. Marc. I. 23-28: II. 11 sq. Hippolytus
briefly defined his doctrine of God in Phil. X. 32. The advance beyond the Apologists' idea
of God consists not only in the thorough discussion of God's attributes of goodness and righteousness,
but also in the view, which is now much more vigorously worked out, that the Almighty Creator
has no other purpose in his world than the salvation of mankind. See the 10th Greek fragment
of Irenæus (Harvey, II. p. 480); Tertull., de orat. 4: "Summa est voluntatis dei salus eorum,
quos adoptavit"; de paenit. 2: "Bonorum dei unus est titulus, salus hominum"; adv. Marc. II.
27: "Nihil tam dignum deo quam salus hominis." They had here undeniably learned from Marcion;
see adv. Marc. I. 17. In the first chapters of the work de orat., however, in which Tertullian
expounds the Lord's Prayer, he succeeded in unfolding the meaning of the Gospel in a way such
as was never possible for him elsewhere. The like remark may be made of Origen's work de orat.,
and, in general, in the case of most authors who interpreted the Lord's Prayer in the succeeding
period. This prayer kept alive the knowledge of the deepest meaning of the Gospel.]

[Footnote 531: Apol. 21: "Necesse et igitur pauca de Christo ut deo ... Jam ediximus deum universitatem
hanc mundi verbo et ratione et virtute molitum. Apud vestros quoque sapientes [Greek: Logon],
id est sermonem et rationem, constat artificem videri universitatis." (An appeal to Zeno and
Cleanthes follows). Et cum radius ex sole porrigitur, portio ex summa; sed sol erit in radio,
quia solis est radius nec separatur substantia sed extenditur (cf. adv. Prax. 8). Ita de spiritu
spiritus et deo deus ut lumen de lumine accensum. Manet integra et indefecta materiæ matrix,
etsi plures inde traduces qualitatis mutueris: ita et quod de deo profectum est, deus est et
dei filius et unus ambo. Ita et de spiritu spiritus et de deo deus modulo alternum numerum,
gradu non statu fecit, et a matrice non necessit sed excessit. Iste igitur dei radius, ut retro
semper prædicabatur, delapsus in virginem quandam et in utero eius caro figuratus nascitur
homo deo mixtus. Caro spiritu instructa nutritur, adolescit, adfatur, docet, operatur et Christus
est." Tertullian adds: "Recipite interim hanc fabulam, similis est vestris." As a matter of
fact the heathen must have viewed this statement as a philosophical speculation with a mythological
conclusion. It is very instructive to ascertain that in Hippolytus' book against Noëtus "the
setting forth of the truth" (c. 10 ff.) he begins with the proposition: [Greek: Theos eboulêthê
kosmon ktisai]. The Logos whose essence and working are described merely went forth to realise
this intention.]

[Footnote 532: See Hagemann, Die römische Kirche (1864), p. 172 ff.]

[Footnote 533: See my detailed exposition of the orthodox side of Tertullian's doctrine of
the Trinity ("orthodox" in the later sense of the word), in Vol. IV. There it is also shown
that these formulæ were due to Tertullian's juristic bias. The formulæ, "una substantia, tres
personæ", never alternates in his case with the others, "una natura, tres personæ"; and so
it remained for a long time in the West; they did not speak of "natures" but of "substances"
("nature" in this connection is very rare down to the 5th century). What makes this remarkable
is the fact that Tertullian always uses "substance" in the concrete sense "individual substance"
and has even expressed himself precisely on the point. He says in de anima 32: "aliud est substantia,
aliud natura substantiæ; siquidem substantia propria est rei cuiusque, natura vero potest esse
communis. Suscipe exemplum: substantia est lapis, ferrum; duritia lapidis et ferri natura substantiæ
est. Duritia (natura) communicat, substantia discordat. Mollitia lanæ, mollitia plumæ pariant
naturalia eorum, substantiva non pariant ... Et tune naturæ similitudo notatur, cum substantiæ
dissimilitudo conspicitur. Men and animals are similar natura, but not substantia." We see
that Tertullian in so far as he designated Father, Son, and Spirit as one substance expressed
their unity as strongly as possible. The only idea intelligible to the majority was a juristic
and political notion, viz., that the Father, who is the tota substantia, sends forth officials
whom he entrusts with the administration of the monarchy. The legal fiction attached to the
concept "person" aided in the matter here.]

[Footnote 534: See adv. Prax. 3: "Igitur si et monarchia divina per tot legiones et exercitus
angelorum administratur, sicut scriptum est: Milies centies centena milia adsistebant ei, et
milies centena milia apparebant ei, nec ideo unius esse desiit, ut desinat monarchia esse,
quia per tanta milia virtutum procuratur: quale est ut deus divisionem et dispersionem pati
videatur in filio et spiritu sancto, secundum et tertium sortitis locum, tam consortibus substantiæ
patris, quam non patitur in tot angelorum numero?" (!!) c. 4: "Videmus igitur non obesse monarchiæ
filium, etsi hodie apud filium est, quia et in suo statu est apud filium, et cum suo statu
restituetur patri a filio." L.c.: "Monarchia in tot nominibus constituta est, in quot deus
voluit."]

[Footnote 535: See Hippol., c. Noetum II. According to these doctrines the unity is sufficiently
preserved (1) if the separate persons have one and the same substance, (2) if there is one
possessor of the whole substance, i.e., if everything proceeds from him. That this is a remnant
of polytheism ought not to be disputed.]

[Footnote 536: Adv. Prax. 8: "Hoc si qui putaverit, me [Greek: probolên] aliquam introducere
id est prolationem rei alterius ex altera, quod facit Valentinus, primo quidem dicam tibi,
non ideo non utatur et veritas vocabulo isto et re ac censu eius, quia et hæresis utitur; immo
hæresis potius ex veritate accepit quod ad mendacium suum strueret"; cf. also what follows.
Thus far then theologians had got already: "The economy is founded on as many names as God
willed" (c. 4).]

[Footnote 537: See adv. Prax. 5.]

[Footnote 538: Tertull., adv. Hermog. 3: "fuit tempus, cum ei filius non fuit."]

[Footnote 539: Novatian (de trin. 23) distinguishes very decidedly between "factum esse" and
"procedere".]

[Footnote 540: Adv. Prax. 2: "Custodiatur [Greek: oikonomias] sacramentum, quæ unitatem in
trinitatem disponit, tres dirigens, tres autem non statu, sed gradu, nec substantia, sed forma,
nec potestate, sed specie, unius autem substantiæ et unius status et potestatis."]

[Footnote 541: See the discussions adv. Prax. 16 ff.]

[Footnote 542: Tertull., adv. Marc. III. 6: "filius portio plenitudinis." In another passage
Tertullian has ironically remarked in opposition to Marcion (IV. 39): "Nisi Marcion Christum
non subiectum patri infert."]

[Footnote 543: Adv. Prax. 9.]

[Footnote 544: See the whole 14th chap. adv. Prax. especially the words: "I am ergo alius erit
qui videbatur, quia non potest idem invisibilis definiri qui videbatur, et consequens erit,
ut invisibilem patrem intellegamus pro plenitudine maiestatis, visibilem vero filium agnoscamus
pro modulo derivationis." One cannot look at the sun itself, but, "toleramus radium eius pro
temperatura portionis, quæ in terram inde porrigitur." The chapter also shows how the Old Testament
theophanies must have given an impetus to the distinction between the Deity as transcendent
and the Deity as making himself visible. Adv. Marc. II. In adv. Prax. 29 Tertullian showed
in very precise terms that the Father is by nature impassible, but the Son is capable of suffering.
Hippolytus does not share this opinion; to him the Logos in himself is likewise [Greek: apathês]
(see c. Noetum 15).]

[Footnote 545: According to Tertullian it is certainly an essential part of the Son's nature
to appear, teach, and thus come into connection with men; but he neither asserted the necessity
of the incarnation apart from the faulty development of mankind, nor can this view be inferred
from his premises.]

[Footnote 546: See adv. Prax. 4. the only passage, however, containing this idea, which is
derived from 1 Cor. XV.]

[Footnote 547: Cf. specially the attempts of Plotinus to reconcile the abstract unity which
is conceived as the principle of the universe with the manifoldness and fulness of the real
and the particular (Ennead. lib. III.-V.). Plotinus employs the subsidiary notion [Greek: merismos]
in the same way as Tertullian; see Hagemann l.c. p. 186 f. Plotinus would have agreed with
Tertullian's proposition in adv. Marc. III. 15: "Dei nomen quasi naturale divinitatis potest
in omnes communicari quibus divinitas vindicatur." Plotinus' idea of hypostasis is also important,
and this notion requires exact examination.]

[Footnote 548: Following the baptismal confession, Tertullian merely treated the Holy Ghost
according to the scheme of the Logos doctrine without any trace of independent interest. In
accordance with this, however, the Spirit possesses his own "numerus"--"tertium numen divinitatis
et tertium nomen maiestatis",--and he is a person in the same sense as the Son, to whom, however,
he is subordinate, for the subordination is a necessary result of his later origin. See cc.
2, 8: "tertius est spiritus a deo et filio, sicut tertius a radice fructus a frutice, et tertius
a fonte rivus a flumine et tertius a sole apex ex radio. Nihil tamen a matrice alienatur a
qua proprietates suas ducit. Ita trinitas per consertos et connexos gradus a patre decurrens
et monarchiæ nihil obstrepit et [Greek: oikonomias] statum protegit"; de pudic. 21. In de præscr.
13 the Spirit in relation to the Son is called "vicaria vis". The element of personality in
the Spirit is with Tertullian merely a result arising from logical deduction; see his successor
Novatian de trin. 29. Hippolytus did not attribute personality to the Spirit, for he says (adv.
Noet. 14): [Greek: Hena Theon erô, prosôpa de duo, oikonomia de tritên tên charin tou hagiou
pneumatos; patêr men gar eis, prosôpa de duo, hoti kai ho huios, to de triton to hagion pneuma].
In his Logos doctrine apart from the express emphasis he lays on the creatureliness of the
Logos (see Philos. X. 33: [Greek: Ei gar Theon se êthelêse poiêsai ho Theos, edunato; echeis
tou logou to paradeigma]) he quite agrees with Tertullian. See ibid.; here the Logos is called
before his coming forth "[Greek: endiathetos tou pantos logismos]"; he is produced [Greek:
ek tôn ontôn], i.e., from the Father who then alone existed; his essence is "that he bears
in himself the will of him who has begotten him" or "that he comprehends in himself the ideas
previously conceived by and resting in the Father." Cyprian in no part of his writings took
occasion to set forth the Logos doctrine in a didactic way; he simply kept to the formula:
"Christus deus et homo", and to the Biblical expressions which were understood in the sense
of divinity and preëxistence; see Testim. II. 1-10. Lactantius was still quite confused in
his Trinitarian doctrine and, in particular, conceived the Holy Ghost not as a person but as
"sanctificatio" proceeding from the Father or from the Son. On the contrary, Novatian, in his
work de trinitate reproduced Tertullian's views. For details see Dorner Entwickelungsgeschichte
I. pp. 563-634, Kahnis, Lehre vom heiligen Geiste; Hagemann, l.c., p. 371 ff. It is noteworthy
that Tertullian still very frequently called the preëxistent Christ dei spiritus; see de oral.
I: "Dei spiritus et dei sermo et dei ratio, sermo rationis et ratio sermonis et spiritus, utrumque
Iesus Christus." Apol. 21: adv. Prax. 26; adv. Marc. I. 10: III. 6, 16: IV. 21.]

[Footnote 551: See Iren., II. 13. 8: II. 28. 4-9: II. 12. 2: II. 13. 2, and also the important
passage II. 29. 3 fin.]

[Footnote 552: A great many passages clearly show that Irenæus decidedly distinguished the
Son from the Father, so that it is absolutely incorrect to attribute modalistic ideas to him.
See III. 6. 1 and all the other passages where Irenæus refers to the Old Testament theophanies.
Such are III. 6. 2: IV. 5. 2 fin.: IV. 7. 4, where the distinction is particularly plain: IV.
17. 6: II. 28. 6.]

[Footnote 553: The Logos (Son) is the administrator and bestower of the divine grace as regards
humanity, because he is the revealer of this grace, see IV. 6 (§ 7: "agnitio patris filius,
agnitio autem filii in patre et per filium revelata"): IV. 5: IV. 16. 7: IV. 20. 7. He has
been the revealer of God from the beginning and always remains so, III. 16. 6: IV. 13. 4 etc.:
he is the antemundane revealer to the angel world, see II. 30. 9: "semper autem coëxsistens
filius patri, olim et ab initio semper revelat patrem et angelis et archangelis et potestatibus
et virtutibus et omnibus, quibus vult revelari deus;" he has always existed with the Father,
see II. 30. 9: III. 18. 1: "non tunc coepit filius dei, exsistens semper apud patrem"; IV.
20. 3, 7, 14. 1: II. 25. 3: "non enim infectus es, o homo, neque semper coëxsistebas deo, sicut
proprium eius verbum." The Logos is God as God, nay, for us he is God himself, in so far as
his work is the work of God. Thus, and not in a modalistic sense, we must understand passages
like II. 30. 9: "fabricator qui fecit mundum per semitipsum, hoc est per verbum et per sapientiam
suam," or hymnlike statements such as III. 16. (see something similar in Ignatius and Melito,
Otto, Corp. Apolog. IX, p. 419 sq.). Irenæus also says in III. 6. 2: "filius est in patre et
habet in se patrem," III. 6. 1.: "utrosque dei appellatione signavit spiritus, et eum qui ungitur
filium et eum, qui ungit, id est patrem." He not only says that the Son has revealed the Father,
but that the Father has revealed the Son (IV. 6. 3: IV. 7. 7). He applies Old Testament passages
sometimes to Christ, sometimes to God, and hence in some cases calls the Father the creator,
and in others the Son ("pater generis humani verbum dei", IV. 31. 2). Irenæus (IV. 4. 2) appropriated
the expression of an ancient "immensum patrem in filio mensuratum; mensura enim patris filius,
quoniam et capit eum." This expression is by no means intended to denote a diminution, but
rather to signify the identity of Father and Son. In all this Irenæus adhered to an ancient
tradition; but these propositions do not admit of being incorporated with a rational system.]

[Footnote 554: Logos and Sophia are the hands of God (III. 21. 10: IV. 20): also IV. 6. 6:
"Invisibile filii pater, visibile autem patris filius." Judging from this passage, it is always
doubtful whether Irenæus, like Tertullian, assumed that transcendency belonged to the Father
in a still higher sense than to the Son, and that the nature of the Son was more adapted for
entering the finite than that of the Father (on the contrary see IV. 20. 7 and especially IV.
24. 2: "verbum naturaliter quidem invisibile"). But it ought not to have been denied that there
are passages, in which Irenæus hints at a subordination of the Son, and deduces this from his
origin. See II. 28. 8 (the knowledge of the Father reaches further than that of the Son and
the Father is greater than the Son); III. 6. 1 (the Son receives from the Father the sovereignty);
IV. 17. 6 (a very important passage: the Father owns the name of Jesus Christ as his, first,
because it is the name of his Son, and, secondly, because he gave it himself); V. 18. 21, 3
("pater conditionem simul et verbum suum portans"--"verbum portatum a patre"--"et sic unus
deus pater ostenditur, qui est super omnia et per omnia et in omnibus; super omnia pater quidem
et ipse est caput Christi"--"verbum universorum potestatem habet a patre"). "This is not a
subordination founded on the nature of the second person, but an inequality that has arisen
historically," says Zahn (l.c., p. 241); but it is doubtful whether such a distinction can
be imputed to Irenæus. We have rather simply to recognise the contradiction, which was not
felt by Irenæus because, in his religious belief, he places Christ on a level with God, but,
as a theologian, merely touched on the problem. So also he shows remarkable unconcern as to
the proof of the unity of God in view of the distinction between Father and Son.]

[Footnote 555: Irenæus very frequently emphasises the idea that the whole economy of God refers
to mankind, see, e.g., I. 10. 3: [Greek: ekdiêgeisthai tên pragmateian kai oikonomian tou Theou
tên epi tê anthrôpotêti genomenên], IV, 20. 7: "Verbum dispensator paternæ gratiæ factus est
ad utilitatem hominum, propter quos fecit tantas dispositiones." God became a creator out of
goodness and love; see the beautiful expression in IV. 20. 7: "Gloria dei vivens homo, vita
autem hominis visio dei," or III. 20. 2: "Gloria hominis deus, operationes vero dei et omnis
sapientias eius et virtutis receptaculum homo." V. 29. 1: "Non homo propter conditionem, sed
conditio facta est propter hominem."]

[Footnote 556: Irenæus speaks about the Holy Spirit in numerous passages. No doubt he firmly
believes in the distinction of the Spirit (Holy Spirit, Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father,
Spirit of the Son, prophetic Spirit, Wisdom) from the Father and Son, and in a particular significance
belonging to the Spirit, as these doctrines are found in the regula. In general the same attributes
as are assigned to the Son are everywhere applicable to him; he was always with the Father
before there was any creation (IV. 20. 3; Irenæus applies Prov. III. 19: VIII. 22 to the Spirit
and not to the Son); like the Son he was the instrument and hand of the Father (IV. pref. 4,
20. 1: V. 6. 1.). That Logos and Wisdom are to be distinguished is clear from IV. 20. 1-12
and particularly from § 12: IV. 7. 4: III. 17. 3 (the host in the parable of the Good Samaritan
is the Spirit). Irenæus also tried by reference to Scripture to distinguish the work of the
Spirit from that of the Logos. Thus in the creation, the guidance of the world, the Old Testament
history, the incarnation, the baptism of Jesus, the Logos is the energy, the Spirit is wisdom.
He also alluded to a specific ministry of the Spirit in the sphere of the new covenant. The
Spirit is the principle of the new knowledge in IV. 33. 1, 7, Spirit of fellowship with God
in V. I. 1, pledge of immortality in V. 8. 1, Spirit of life in V. 18. 2. But not only does
the function of the Spirit remain very obscure for all that, particularly in the incarnation,
where Irenæus was forced by the canon of the New Testament to unite what could not be united
(Logos doctrine and descent of the Spirit upon Mary--where, moreover, the whole of the Fathers
after Irenæus launched forth into the most wonderful speculations), but even the personality
of the Spirit vanishes with him, e.g., in III. 18. 3: "unguentem patrem et unctum filium et
unctionem, qui est spiritus" (on Isaiah LXI. 1); there is also no mention of the Spirit in
IV. pref. 4 fin., and IV. 1. 1, though he ought to have been named there. Father, Son, and
Spirit, or God, Logos, and Sophia are frequently conjoined by Irenæus, but he never uses the
formula [Greek: trias], to say nothing of the abstract formulas of Tertullian. In two passages
(IV. 20. 5: V. 36. 2) Irenæus unfolded a sublime speculation, which is inconsistent with his
usual utterances. In the first passage he says that God has shown himself prophetically through
the Spirit (in the Old Testament), then adoptively through the Son, and will finally show himself
paternally in the kingdom of heaven; the Spirit prepares man for the Son of God, the Son leads
him to the Father, but the Father confers on him immortality. In the other passage he adopts
the saying of an old presbyter (Papias?) that we ascend gradually through the Spirit to the
Son, and through the Son to the Father, and that in the end the Son will deliver up everything
to the Father, and God will be all in all. It is remarkable that, as in the case of Tertullian
(see above), it is 1 Cor. XV. 23-28 that has produced this speculation. This is another clear
proof, that in Irenæus the equality of Father, Son, and Spirit is not unconditional and that
the eternity of Son and Spirit is not absolute. Here also we plainly perceive that the several
disquisitions in Irenæus were by no means part of a complete system. Thus, in IV. 38. 2, he
inverts the relationship and says that we ascend from the Son to the Spirit: [Greek: Kai dia

[Footnote 558: Here the whole 38th chapter of the 4th Book is to be examined. The following
sentences are perhaps the most important: [Greek: Ei de legei tis ouk êdunato ho Theos ap'
archês teleion anadeixai ton anthrôpon, Gnôtô, hoti tô men Theô, aei kata ta auta onti kai

beginning, but the child cannot stand it: [Greek: anthrôpos adunatos labein auto; nêpios gar
ên], see also § 2-4: "Non ab initio dii facti sumus, sed primo quidem homines, tunc demum dii,
quamvis deus secundum simplicitatem bonitatis suæ hoc fecerit, nequis eum putet invidiosum
aut impræstantem." "Ego," inquit, "dixi, dii estis et filii excelsi omnes, nobis autem potestatem
divinitatis baiulare non sustinentibus" ... "Oportuerat autem primo naturam apparere, post
deinde vinci et absorbi mortale ab immortalitate et corruptibile ab incorruptibilitate, et
fieri hominem secundum imaginem et similitudinem dei, agnitione accepta boni et mali." Ibid.:
[Greek: hupotagê Theou aptharsia, kai paramonê aptharsias doxa agennêtos ... horasis Theou
peripoiêtikê aptharsias; aptharsia de eggus einai poiei Theou]. In this chapter Irenæus contemplates
the manner of appearance of the Logos (as man) from the point of view of a [Greek: sunnêpiazein].
His conception of the capacity and destination of man enabled him to develop his ideas about
the progressive training of the human race and about the different covenants (see below). On
this point cf. also IV. 20. 5-7. The fact that, according to this way of looking at things,
the Good and Divine appeared only as the destination of man--which was finally to be reached
through divine guidance--but not as his nature, suggested both to Irenæus and Tertullian the
distinction between "natura" and "gratia" or between "substantia" and "fides et iustitia."
In other words, they were led to propound a problem which had occurred to the Gnostics long
before, and had been solved by them in a dualistic sense. See Irenæus II. 29. 1: "Si propter
substantiam omnes succedunt animæ in refrigerium, et superfluum est credere, superflua autem
et discessio salvatoris; si autem propter iustitiam, iam non propter id, quod sint animæ sed
quoniam sunt iustæ ... Si enim natura et substantia salvat, omnes salvabuntur animæ; si autem
iustitia et fides etc." II. 34. 34. 4. Tertullian adv. Marc. III. 15: "Christi nomen non ex
natura veniens, sed ex dispositione." In Tertullian these ideas are not unfrequently opposed
to each other in this way; but the relationship between them has by no means been made clear.]

[Footnote 559: On the psychology of Irenæus see Bohringer, p. 466 f., Wendt p. 22. The fact
that in some passages he reckoned the [Greek: pneuma] in man as the latter's inalienable nature
(e.g. II. 33-5), though as a rule (like Tatian) he conceives it as the divine Spirit, is an
evident inconsistency on his part. The [Greek: eikôn] is realised in the body, the [Greek:
homoiôsis] is not given by nature, but is brought about by the union with the Spirit of God
realised through obedience (V. 6. 1). The [Greek: homoiôsis] is therefore subject to growth,
and was not perfect at the beginning (see above, IV. 38. 4, where he opposes Tatian's opinion).
It is clear, especially from V. 12. 2, that it is only the [Greek: pnoê], not the [Greek: pneuma],
that is to be conceived as an original possession. On this point Irenæus appealed to 1 Cor.
XV. 45. It is plain from the 37th chapter of the 4th Book, that Irenæus also views everything
as ultimately dependent on man's inalienable freedom. Alongside of this God's goodness has
scope for displaying itself in addition to its exercise at the creation, because it guides
man's knowledge through counsel; see § 1. On Matth. XXIII. 37 Irenæus remarks: "veterem legem
libertatis hominis manifestavit, quia liberum eum deus fecit ab initio, habentem suam potestatem
sicut et suam animam ad utendum sententia dei voluntarie et non coactum a deo ... posuit in
homine potestatem electionis quemadmodum in angelis (et enim angeli rationabiles), ut hi quidem
qui obedissent iuste bonum sint possidentes, datum quidem a deo, servatum vero ab ipsis." An
appeal to Rome II. 4-7 (!) follows. In § 2 Irenæus inveighs violently against the Gnostic doctrines
of natural goodness and wickedness: [Greek: pantes tês autês eisi physeôs]. In § 4 he interprets
the Pauline: "omnia licent, sed non omnia expediunt," as referring to man's inalienable freedom
and to the way in which it is abused in order to work evil(!): "liberæ sententiæ ab initio
est homo et liberæ sententiæ est deus, cuius ad similitudinem factus est." § 5: "Et non tantum
in operibus, sed etiam in fide, liberum et suæ potestatis arbitrium hominis servavit (that
is, respected) dominus, dicens: Secundum fidem tuam fiat tibi." § 4: "deus consilium dat continere
bonum, quod perficitur ex obedientia." § 3: "[Greek: to autexousion tou anthrôpou kai to symbouleutikon
tou Theou mê biazomenou]." IV. 4. 3: "homo rationabilis et secundum hoc similis deo liber in
arbitrio factus et suæ potestatis, ipse sibi causa est, ut aliquando quidem frumentum aliquando
autem palea fiat."]

[Footnote 560: As a matter of fact this view already belongs to the second train of thought;
see particularly III. 21-23. Here in reality this merely applies to the particular individuals
who chose disobedience, but Irenæus almost everywhere referred back to the fall of Adam. See,
however, V. 27. 2: "Quicunque erga eum custodiunt dilectionem, suam his præstat communionem.
Communio autem dei vita et lumen et fruitio eorum quæ sunt apud deum bonorum. Quicumque autem
absistunt secundum sententiam suam ab eo, his eam quæ electa est ab ipsis separationem inducit.
Separatio autem dei mors, et separatio lucis tenebræ, et separatio dei amissio omnium quæ sunt
apud eum bonorum." V. 19. 1, 1. 3, 1. 1. The subjective moralism is very clearly defined in
IV. 15. 2: "Id quod erat semper liberum et suæ potestatis in homine semper servavit deus et
sua exhortatio, ut iuste iudicentur qui non obediunt ei quoniam non obedierunt, et qui obedierunt
et crediderunt ei, honorentur incorruptibilitate."]

[Footnote 561: Man's sin is thoughtlessness; he is merely led astray (IV. 40. 3). The fact
that he let himself be seduced under the pretext of immortality is an excuse for him; man was
infans, (See above; hence it is said, in opposition to the Gnostics, in IV. 38. 4: "supergredieutes
legem humani generis et antequam fiant homines, iam volunt similes esse factori deo et nullam
esse differentiam infecti dei et nunc facti hominis." The same idea is once more very clearly
expressed in IV. 39. 3; "quemadmodum igitur erit homo deus, qui nondum factus est homo?" i.e.,
how could newly created man be already perfect as he was not even man, inasmuch as he did not
yet know how to distinguish good and evil?). Cf. III. 23. 3, 5: "The fear of Adam was the beginning
of wisdom; the sense of transgression led to repentance; but God bestows his grace on the penitent"
... "eum odivit deus, qui seduxit hominem, ei vero qui seductus est, sensim paullatimque misertus
est." The "pondus peccati" in the sense of Augustine was by no means acknowledged by Irenæus,
and although he makes use of Pauline sayings, and by preference such as have a quite different
sense, he is very far from sharing Paul's view.]

[Footnote 562: See IV. 37. 7: "Alias autem esset nostrum insensatum bonum, quod esset inexercitatum.
Sed et videre non tantum nobis esset desiderabile, nisi cognovissemus quantum esset malum non
videre; et bene valere autem male valentis experientia honorabilius efficit, et lucem tenebrarum
comparatio et vitam mortis. Sic et coeleste regnum honorabilius est his qui cognoverunt terrenum."
The main passage is III. 20. 1, 2, which cannot be here quoted. The fall was necessary in order
that man might not believe that he was "naturaliter similis deo." Hence God permitted the great
whale to swallow man for a time. In several passages Irenæus has designated the permitting
of evil as kind generosity on the part of God, see, e.g., IV. 39. 1, 37. 7.]

[Footnote 563: See Wendt, l.c., p. 24.]

[Footnote 564: See III. 23. 23. 2, 5. 3: "libertatem restauravit"; IV. 24. 1: "reformavit humamum
genus"; III. 17. 1: "spiritus sanctus in filium dei, filium hominis factum, descendit cum ipso
assuescens habitare in genere humano." III. 19. 1: IV. 38. 3: 39. 1, 2. Wendt's summary, l.c.,
p. 24: "By the Logos becoming man, the type of the perfect man made its appearance," formulates
Irenæus' meaning correctly and excludes the erroneous idea that he viewed the Logos himself
as the prototype of humanity. A real divine manhood is not necessary within this train of thought;
only a homo inspiratus is required.]

[Footnote 566: See Hippol. Philos. X. 33 (p. 538 sq.): [Greek: Epi toutois ton pantôn archonta

The famous concluding chapter of the Philosophoumena with its prospect of deification is to
be explained from this (X. 34).]

[Footnote 567: See Tertull. adv. Marc. II. 4-11; his undiluted moralism appears with particular
clearness in chaps. 6 and 8. No weight is to be attached to the phrase in chapter 4 that God
by placing man in Paradise really even then put him from Paradise into the Church. This is
contrary to Wendt's opinion, l.c., p. 67. ff., where the exposition of Tertullian is speciosior
quam verior. In adv. Marc. II. 4 ff. Wendt professes to see the first traces of the scholastic
and Romish theory, and in de anima 16, 41 the germ of the subsequent Protestant view.]

[Footnote 568: See IV. 5. 1, 6. 4.]

[Footnote 569: See IV 14. 1: "In quantum enim deus nullius indiget, in tantum homo indiget
dei communione. Hæc enim gloria hominis, perseverare et permanere in dei servitute." This statement,
which, like the numerous others where Irenæus speaks of the adoptio, is opposed to moralism,
reminds us of Augustine. In Irenæus' great work, however, we can point out not a few propositions
which, so to speak, bear the stamp of Augustine; see IV. 38. 3: [Greek: hupotagê Theou aphtharsia].]

[Footnote 570: See the passages quoted above, p. 241 f.]

[Footnote 571: See III. 18. 1. V. 16. 1 is very remarkable: [Greek: En tois prosthen chronois
elegeto men kat' eikona Theou gegonenai ton anthrôpon, ouk edeiknuto de, eti gar aoratos ên
ho logos, ou kat' eikona ho anthrôpos egegonei. dia touto dê kai tên homoiôsin iadiôs apebalen];
see also what follows. In V. I. 1 Irenæus even says: "Quoniam iniuste dominabatur nobis apostasia,
et cum natura essemus dei omnipotentis, alienavit nos contra naturam diabolus." Compare with
this the contradictory passage IV. 38: "oportuerat autem primo naturam apparere" etc. (see
above, p. 268), where natura hominis is conceived as the opposite of the divine nature.]

[Footnote 572: See Wendt, l.c., p. 29, who first pointed out the two dissimilar trains of thought
in Irenæus with regard to man's original state, Duncker having already done so in regard to
his Christology. Wendt has rightly shown that we have here a real and not a seeming contradiction;
but, as far as the explanation of the fact is concerned, the truth does not seem to me to have
been arrived at. The circumstance that Irenæus did not develop the mystic view in such a systematic
way as the moralistic by no means justifies us in supposing that he merely adopted it superficially
(from the Scriptures): for its nature admits of no systematic treatment, but only of a rhetorical
and contemplative one. No further explanation can be given of the contradiction, because, strictly
speaking, Irenæus has only given us fragments.]

[Footnote 573: See V. 16. 3: [Greek: en tô prôtô Adam prosekopsamen, mê poiêsantes autou tên
entolên]. IV. 34. 2: "homo initio in Adam inobediens per mortem percussus est;" III. 18. 7-23:
V. 19. 1: V. 21. 1: V. 17. 1 sq.]

[Footnote 574: Here also Irenæus keeps sin in the background; death and life are the essential
ideas. Bohringer l.c., p. 484 has very rightly remarked: "We cannot say that Irenæus, in making
Adam's conduct and suffering apply to the whole human race had started from an inward, immediate
experience of human sinfulness and a feeling of the need of salvation founded on this." It
is the thoughts of Paul to which Irenæus tried to accommodate himself without having had the
same feeling about the flesh and sin as this Apostle. In Tertullian the mystic doctrine of
salvation is rudimentary (but see, e.g. de anima 40: "ita omnis anima eo usque in Adam censetur
donec in Christo recenseatur," and other passages); but he has speculations about Adam (for
the most part developments of hints given in Irenæus; see the index in Oehler's edition), and
he has a new realistic idea as to a physical taint of sin propagated through procreation. Here
we have the first beginning of the doctrine of original sin (de testim. Compare his teachings
in de anima 40, 41, 16 about the disease of sin that is propagated "ex originis vitio" and
has become a real second nature). But how little he regards this original sin as guilt is shown
by de bapt. 18: "Quaie innocens ætas festinat ad baptismum." For the rest, Tertullian discussed
the relationship of flesh and spirit, sensuousness and intellect, much more thoroughly than
Irenæus; he showed that flesh is not the seat of sin (de anima 40). In the same book (but see
Bk. V. c. 1) he expressly declared that in this question also sure results are only to be obtained
from revelation. This was an important step in the direction of secularising Christianity through
"philosophy" and of emasculating the understanding through "revelation." In regard to the conception
of sin Cyprian followed his teacher. De op. et eleem. 1 reads indeed like an utterance of Irenæus
("dominus sanavit illa quæ Adam portaverat vulnera"); but the statement in ep. 64. 5: "Recens
natus nihil peccavit, nisi quod secundum Adam carnaliter natus contagium mortis antiquæ prima
nativitate contraxit" is quite in the manner of Tertullian, and perhaps the latter could also
have agreed with the continuation: "infanti remittuntur non propria sed aliena peccata." Tertullian's
proposition that absolutely no one but the Son of God could have remained without sin was repeated
by Cyprian (see, e.g., de op. et eleem. 3).]

[Footnote 575: III. 22. 4 has quite a Gnostic sound ... "eam quæ est a Maria in Evam recirculationem
significans; quia non aliter quod colligatum est solveretur, nisi ipsæ compagines alligationis
reflectantur retrorsus, ut primæ coniunctiones solvantur per secundas, secundæ rursus liberent
primas. Et evenit primam quidem compaginem a secunda colligatione solvere, secundam vero colligationem
primæ solutionis habere locum. Et propter hoc dominus dicebat primos quidem novissimos futuros
et novissimos primos." Irenæus expresses a Gnostic idea when he on one occasion plainly says
(V. 12. 3): [Greek: En tô Adam pantes apothnêskomen, hoti psychikoi.] But Paul, too, made an
approach to this thought.]

[Footnote 576: See III. 23. 1, 2, a highly characteristic statement.]

[Footnote 577: See, e.g., III. 9. 3, 12. 2, 16. 6-9, 17. 4 and repeatedly 8. 2: "verbum dei,
per quem facta sunt omnia, qui est dominus noster Jesus Christus."]

[Footnote 578: See IV. 6. 7.]

[Footnote 579: See III. 11. 3.]

[Footnote 580: See III. 6.]

[Footnote 581: See III. 19. 1, 2: IV. 33. 4: V. 1. 3; see also Tertullian against "Ebion" de
carne 14, 18, 24; de præser. 10. 33.]

[Footnote 582: See III. 21, 22: V. 19-21.]

[Footnote 583: See the arguments, l.c., V. 19. We find the same in Tertull., de carne 17, 20.
In this connection we find in both very extravagant expressions with regard to Mary (see, e.g.
Tertull., l.c. 20 fin.: "uti virgo esset regeneratio nostra spiritaliter ab omnibus inquinamentis
sanctificata per Christum." Iren. III. 21. 7: "Maria cooperans dispositioni (dei);" III. 22.
4 "Maria obediens et sibi et universo generi humano causa facta est salutis" ... "quod alligavit
virgo Eva per incredulitatem, hoc virgo Maria solvit per fidem"). These, however, have no doctrinal
significance; in fact the same Tertullian expressed himself in a depreciatory way about Mary
in de carne 7. On the other hand it is undeniable that the later Mariolatry has one of its
roots in the parallel between Eve and Mary. The Gnostic invention of the virginitas Mariæ in
partu can hardly be traced in Irenæus III. 21. 4. Tertullian (de carne 23) does not seem to
know anything about it as yet, and very decidedly assumed the natural character of the process.
The popular conception as to the reason of Christ's birth from a virgin, in the form still
current to-day, but beneath all criticism, is already found in Tertullian de carne 18: "Non
competebat ex semine humano dei filium nasci, ne, si totus esset filius hominis, non esset
et dei filius, nihilque haberet amplius Salomone, ut de Hebionis opinione credendus erat Ergo
iam dei filius ex patris dei semine, id est spiritu, ut esset et hominis filius, caro ei sola
competebat ex hominis carne sumenda sine viri semine. Vacabat enim semen viri apud habentem
dei semen." The other theory existing side by side with this, viz., that Christ would have
been a sinner if he had been begotten from the semen, whereas he could assume sinless flesh
from woman is so far as I know scarcely hinted at by Irenæus and Tertullian. The fact of Christ's
birth was frequently referred to by Tertullian in order to prove Christ's kinship to God the
Creator, e.g., adv. Marc. III. 11. Hence this article of the regula fidei received a significance
from this point of view also. An Encratite explanation of the birth from the Virgin is found
in the old treatise de resurr. bearing Justin's name (Otto, Corp. Apol. III., p. 220.)]

[Footnote 584: See, e.g., III. 18. 1 and many other places. See the passages named in note,
p. 276.]

[Footnote 585: So also Tertullian. See adv. Marc. III. 8: The whole work of salvation is destroyed
by Docetism; cf. the work de carne Christi. Tertullian exclaims to the Docetist Marcion in
c. 5: "Parce unicæ spei totius orbis." Irenæus and Tertullian mean that Christ's assumption
of humanity was complete, but not unfrequently express themselves in such a manner as to convey
the impression that the Logos only assumed flesh. This is particularly the case with Tertullian,
who, moreover, in his earlier time had probably quite naive Docetic ideas and really looked
upon the humanity of Christ as only flesh. See Apolog. 21: "spiritum Christus cum verbo sponte
dimisit, prævento carnincis officio." Yet Irenæus in several passages spoke of Christ's human
soul (III. 22. 1: V. 1. 1) as also did Melito ([Greek: to alêthes kai aphantaston tês psuchês
Christou kai tou sômatos, tês kath' hêmas anthrôpinês phuseôs] Otto, l.c., IX., p. 415) and
Tertullian (de carne 10 ff. 13; de resurr. 53). What we possess in virtue of the creation was
assumed by Christ (Iren., l.c., III. 22. 2.) Moreover, Tertullian already examined how the
case stands with sin in relation to the flesh of Christ. In opposition to the opinion of the
heretic Alexander, that the Catholics believe Jesus assumed earthly flesh in order to destroy
the flesh of sin in himself, he shows that the Saviour's flesh was without sin and that it
is not admissible to teach the annihilation of Christ's flesh (de carne 16; see also Irenæus
V. 14. 2, 3): "Christ by taking to himself our flesh has made it his own, that is, he has made
it sinless." It was again passages from Paul (Rom. VIII. 3 and Ephes. II. 15) that gave occasion
to this discussion. With respect to the opinion that it may be with the flesh of Christ as
it is with the flesh of angels who appear, Tertullian remarks (de carne 6) that no angel came
to die; that which dies must be born; the Son of God came to die.]

[Footnote 586: This conception was peculiar to Irenæus, and for good reasons was not repeated
in succeeding times; see II. 22: III. 17. 4. From it also Irenæus already inferred the necessity
of the death of Christ and his abode in the lower world, V. 31. 1, 2. Here we trace the influence
of the recapitulation idea. It has indeed been asserted (very energetically by Schultz, Gottheit
Christi, p. 73 f.) that the Christ of Irenæus was not a personal man, but only possessed humanity.
But that is decidedly incorrect, the truth merely being that Irenæus did not draw all the inferences
from the personal humanity of Christ.]

[Footnote 587: See Iren. V. 31. 2: "Surgens in carne sic ascendit ad patrem." Tertullian, de
carne 24: "Bene quod idem veniet de cælis qui est passus ... et agnoscent qui eum confixerunt,
utique ipsam carnem in quam sævierunt, sine qua nee ipse esse poterit et agnosci;" see also
what follows.]

[Footnote 588: See Iren. IV. 33. 11.]

[Footnote 589: See Iren. IV. 20. 4; see also III. 19. 1.]

[Footnote 590: He always posits the unity in the form of a confession without describing it.
See III. 16. 6, which passage may here stand for many. V. 18. 1: "Ipsum verbum dei incarnatum
suspensum est super lignum."]

[Footnote 591: Here Irenæus was able to adopt the old formula "God has suffered" and the like;
so also Melito, see Otto l.c., IX. p. 416: [Greek: ho Theos peponuen hupo dexias Israêlitidos]
(p. 422): "Quidnam est hoc novum mysterium? iudex iudicatur et quietus est; invisibilis videtur
neque erubescit: incomprehensibilis prehenditur neque indignatur, incommensurabilis mensuratur
neque repugnat; impassibilis patitur neque ulciscitur; immortalis moritur, neque respondit
verbum, coelestis sepelitur et id fert." But let us note that these are not "doctrines," but
testimonies to the faith, as they were always worded from the beginning and such as could,
if need were, be adapted to any Christology. Though Melito in a fragment whose genuineness
is not universally admitted (Otto, l.c., p. 415 sq.) declared in opposition to Marcion, that
Christ proved his humanity to the world in the 30 years before his baptism; but showed the
divine nature concealed in his human nature during the 3 years of his ministry, he did not
for all that mean to imply that Jesus' divinity and humanity are in any way separated. But,
though Irenæus inveighed so violently against the "Gnostic" separation of Jesus and Christ
(see particularly III. 16. 2, where most weight is laid on the fact that we do not find in
Matth.: "Iesu generatio sic erat" but "Christi generatio sic erat"), there is no doubt that
in some passages he himself could not help unfolding a speculation according to which the predicates
applying to the human nature of Jesus do not also hold good of his divinity, in fact he actually
betrayed a view of Christ inconsistent with the conception of the Saviour's person as a perfect
unity. We can indeed only trace this view in his writings in the form of an undercurrent, and
what led to it will be discussed further on. Both he and Melito, as a rule adhered to the simple
"filius dei filius hominis factus" and did not perceive any problem here, because to them the
disunion prevailing in the world and in humanity was the difficult question that appeared to
be solved through this very divine manhood. How closely Melito agreed with Irenæus is shown
not only by the proposition (p. 419): "Propterea misit pater filium suum e coelo sine corpore
(this is said in opposition to the Valentinian view), ut, postquam incarnatus esset in, utero
virginis et natus esset homo, vivificaret hominem et colligeret membra eius quæ mors disperserat,
quum hominem divideret," but also by the "propter hominem iudicatus est iudex, impassibilis
passus est?" (l.c.).]

[Footnote 592: The concepts employed by Irenæus are deus, verbum, filius dei, homo, filius
hominis, plasma dei. What perhaps hindered the development of that formula in his case was
the circumstance of his viewing Christ, though he had assumed the plasma dei, humanity, as
a personal man who (for the sake of the recapitulation theory) not only had a human nature
but was obliged to live through a complete human life. The fragment attributed to Irenæus (Harvey
II., p. 493) in which occur the words, [Greek: tou Theou logou henôoei tê kath' hupostasin
physikê henôthentos tê sakri], is by no means genuine. How we are to understand the words:
[Greek: hina ex amphoterôn to periphanes tôn physeôn paradeichthê] in fragment VIII. (Harvey
II., p. 479), and whether this piece belongs to Irenæus, is uncertain. That Melito (assuming
the genuineness of the fragment) has the formula of the two natures need excite no surprise;
for (1) Melito was also a philosopher, which Irenæus was not, and (2) it is found in Tertullian,
whose doctrines can be shown to be closely connected with those of Melito (see my Texte und
Untersuchungen I. 1, 2, p. 249 f.). If that fragment is genuine Melito is the first Church
teacher who has spoken of two natures.]

[Footnote 593: See Apol. 21: "verbum caro figuratus ... homo deo mixtus;" adv. Marc. II. 27:
"filius dei miscens in semetipso hominem et deum;" de carne 15: "homo deo mixtus;" 18: "sic
homo cum deo, dum caro hominis cum spiritu dei." On the Christology of Tertullian cf. De pat.
3: "nasci se deus in utero patitur." The formula: [Greek: ho gennêtheis, ho megas Theos] is
also found in Sibyll. VII. 24.]

[Footnote 595: De carne I, cf. ad nat. II. 4: "ut iure consistat collegium nominis communione
substantiæ."]

[Footnote 596: De carne 18 fin.]

[Footnote 597: Adv. Prax. 27: "Sed enim invenimus illum diiecto et deum et hominem expositum,
ipso hoc psalmo suggerente (Ps. LXXXVII. 5) ... hic erit homo et filius hominis, qui definitus
est filius dei secundum spiritum ... Videmus duplicem statum, non confusum sed coniunctum in
una persona deum et hominem Iesum. De Christo autem differo. Et adeo salva est utriusque proprietas
substantiæ, ut et spiritus res suas egerit in illo, id est virtutes et opera et signa, et caro
passiones suas functa sit, esuriens sub diabolo ... denique et mortua est. Quodsi tertium quid
esset, ex utroque confusum, ut electrum, non tam distincta documenta parerent utrinsque substantiæ."
In what follows the actus utriusque substantiæ are sharply demarcated: "ambæ substantiæ in
statu suo quæque distincte agebant, ideo illis et operæ et exitus sui occurrerunt ... neque
caro spiritus fit neque spiritus caro: in uno plane esse possunt." See also c. 29: "Quamquam
cum duæ substantiæ censeantur in Christo Iesu, divina et humana, constet autem immortalem esse
divinam" etc.]

[Footnote 598: Of this in a future volume. Here also two substances in Christ are always spoken
of (there are virtually three, since, according to de anima 35, men have already two substances
in themselves) I know only one passage where Tertullian speaks of natures in reference to Christ,
and this passage in reality proves nothing; de carne 5: "Itaque utriusque substantiæ census
hominem et deum exhibuit, hinc natum, inde non natum (!), hinc carneum, inde spiritalem" etc.
Then: "Quæ proprietas conditionum, divinæ et humanæ, æqua utique naturæ cuiusque veritate disjuncta
est."]

[Footnote 599: In the West up to the time of Leo I. the formula "deus et homo," or, after Tertullian's
time "duæ substantiæ," was always a simple expression of the facts acknowledged in the Symbol,
and not a speculation derived from the doctrine of redemption. This is shown just from the
fact of stress being laid on the unmixedness. With this was associated a theoretic and apologetic
interest on the part of theologians, so that they began to dwell at greater length on the unmixedness
after the appearance of that Patripassianism, which professed to recognise the filius dei in
the caro, that is in the deus so far as he is incarnatus or has changed himself into flesh.
As to Tertullian's opposition to this view see what follows. In contradistinction to this Western
formula the monophysite one was calculated to satisfy both the salvation interest and the understanding.
The Chalcedonian creed, as is admitted by Schulz, l.c., pp. 64 ff., 71 ff., is consequently
to be explained from Tertullian's view, not from that of the Alexandrians. Our readers will
excuse us for thus anticipating.]

[Footnote 600: "Quare," says Irenæus III. 21. 10--"igitur non iterum sumpsit limum deus sed
ex Maria operatus est plasmationem fieri? Ut non alia plasmatio fieret neque alia, esset plasmatio
quæ salvaietur, sed eadem ipsa recapitularetur, servata similitudine?"]

[Footnote 601: See de carne 18. Oehler has misunderstood the passage and therefore mispointed
it. It is as follows: "Vox ista (Joh. I. 14) quid caro factum sit contestatur, nec tamen periclitatur,
quasi statim aliud sit (verbum), factum caro, et non verbum.... Cum scriptura non dicat nisi
quod factum sit, non et unde sit factum, ergo ex alio, non ex semetipso suggerit factum" etc.]

[Footnote 602: Adv. Prax. 27 sq. In de carne 3 sq. and elsewhere Tertullian indeed argues against
Marcion that God in contradistinction to all creatures can transform himself into anything
and yet remain God. Hence we are not to think of a transformation in the strict sense, but
of an adunitio.]

[Footnote 603: So I think I ought to express myself. It does not seem to me proper to read
a twofold conception into Irenæus' Christological utterances under the pretext that Christ
according to him was also the perfect man, with all the modern ideas that are usually associated
with this thought (Bohringer, l.c., p. 542 ff., see Thomasius in opposition to him).]

[Footnote 604: See, e.g., V. 1. 3. Nitzch, Dogmengeschichte I. p. 309. Tertullian, in his own
peculiar fashion, developed still more clearly the thought transmitted to him by Irenæus. See
adv. Prax. 12: "Quibus faciebat deus hominem similem? Filio quidem, qui erat induturus hominem....
Erat autem ad cuius imaginem faciebat, ad filii scilicet, qui homo futurus certior et verior
imaginem suam fecerat dici hominem, qui tunc de limo formari habebat, imago veri et similitudo."
Adv. Marc. V. 8: "Creator Christum, sermonem suum, intuens hominem futurum, Faciamus, inquit,
hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram"; the same in de resurr. 6. But with Tertullian,
too, this thought was a sudden idea and did not become the basis of further speculation.]

[Footnote 605: Iren. IV. 14. 2; for further particulars on the point see below, where Irenæus'
views on the preparation of salvation are discussed. The views of Dorner, l.c., 492 f., that
the union of the Son of God with humanity was a gradual process, are marred by some exaggerations,
but are correct in their main idea.]

[Footnote 606: "Secundum id quod verbum dei homo erat ex radice lesse et filius Abrabæ, secunum
hoc requiescebat spiritus dei super eum ... secundum autem quod deus erat, non secundum gloriam
iudicabat." All that Irenæus said of the Spirit in reference to the person of Christ is to
be understood merely as an exegetical necessity and must not be regarded as a theoretical principle
(this is also the case with Tertullian). Dorner (l.c., p. 492 f.) has failed to see this, and
on the basis of Irenæus' incidental and involuntary utterances has attempted to found a speculation
which represents the latter as meaning that the Holy Ghost was the medium which gradually united
the Logos, who was exalted above growing and suffering, into one person with the free and growing
man in Jesus Christ. In III. 12. 5-7 Irenæus, in conformity with Acts IV. 27: X. 38, used the
following other formulæ about Christ: [Greek: ho Theos, ho poiêsas ton ouranon k.t.l., kai
ho toutou pais, on echrisen ho Theos]--"Petrus Iesum ipsum esse filium dei testificatus est,
qui et unctus Spiritu Sancto Iesus dicitur." But Irenæus only expressed himself thus because
of these passages, whereas Hippolytus not unfrequently calls Christ [Greek: pais Theos].]

[Footnote 607: On Hippolytus' views of the incarnation see Dorner, l.c., I. p. 609 ff.--an
account to be used with caution--and Overbeck, Quæst. Hippol. Specimen (1864), p. 47 sq. Unfortunately
the latter has not carried out his intention to set forth the Christology of Hippolytus in
detail. In the work quoted he has, however, shown how closely the latter in many respects has
imitated Irenæus in this case also. It is instructive to see what Hippolytus has not adopted
from Irenæus or what has become rudimentary with him. As a professional and learned teacher
he is at bottom nearer to the Apologists as regards his Christology than Irenæus. As an exegete
and theological author he has much in common with the Alexandrians, just as he is in more than
one respect a connecting link between Catholic controversialists like Irenæus and Catholic
scholars like Origen. With the latter he moreover came into personal contact. See Hieron.,
de vir. inl. 61: Hieron., ep. ad Damas. edit. Venet. I., ep. 36 is also instructive. These
brief remarks are, however, by no means intended to give countenance to Kimmel's untenable
hypothesis (de Hippol. vita et scriptis, 1839) that Hippolytus was an Alexandrian. In Hippolytus'
treatise c. Noët. we find positive teachings that remind us of Tertullian. An important passage
is de Christo et Antichristo 3 f.: [Greek: eis gar kai ho tou Theou] (Iren.), [Greek: di' ou
kai hêmeis tuchontes tên dia tou hagiou pneumatos anagennesin eis ena teleion kai epouranion
anthrôpon hoi pantes katantêsai epithumoumen] (see Iren.) [Greek: Epeidê gar ho logos tou Theou
asarkos ôn] (see Melito, Iren., Tertull.) [Greek: enedusato tên hagian sarka ek tês hagias
parthenou; hôs numphios himation exuphanas heautô ên tô staurikô pathei] (Irenæus and Tertullian
also make the death on the cross the object of the assumption of the flesh), [Greek: hopôs
sygkerasas to thnêton hemôn sôma tê heautou dunamei kai mixas] (Iren., Tertull.) [Greek: tô
aphthartô to phtharton kai to asthenes tô ischurô sôse ton apollumenon anthrôpon] (Iren.).
The succeeding disquisition deserves particular note, because it shows that Hippolytus has
also borrowed from Irenæus the idea that the union of the Logos with humanity had already begun
in a certain way in the prophets. Overbeck has rightly compared the [Greek: anaplassein di'
heutou ton Adam] l.c., c. 26, with the [Greek: anakephalaioun] of Irenæus and l.c., c. 44,
with Iren. II. 22, 4. For Hippolytus' Christology Philosoph. X. 33, p. 542 and c. Noet. 10
ff. are the chief passages of additional importance. In the latter passage it is specially
noteworthy that Hippolytus, in addition to many other deviations from Irenæus and Tertullian,
insists on applying the full name of Son only to the incarnate Logos. In this we have a remnant
of the more ancient idea and at the same time a concession to his opponents who admitted an
eternal Logos in God, but not a pre-temporal hypostasis of the Son. See c. 15: [Greek: poion
oun huion heautou ho Theos dia tês sarkos katepempsen all' hê ton logon; hon huion prosêgoreue
dia to mellein auton genesthai, kai to koinon onoma tês eis anthrôpous philostorgias analambanei

êdunato dia to en logô tên sustasin echein houtôs oun eis huios teleios Theou ephanerôthê.]
Hippolytus partook to a much greater extent than his teacher Irenæus of the tree of Greek knowledge
and he accordingly speaks much more frequently than the latter of the "divine mysteries" of
the faith. From the fragments and writings of this author that are preserved to us the existence
of very various Christologies can be shown; and this proves that the Christology of his teacher
Irenæus had not by any means yet become predominant in the Church, as we might suppose from
the latter's confident tone. Hippolytus is an exegete and accordingly still yielded with comparative
impartiality to the impressions conveyed by the several passages. For example he recognised
the woman of Rev. XII. as the Church and the Logos as her child, and gave the following exegesis
of the passage (de Christo et Antichristo 61): [Greek: ou pausetai hê ekklêsia gennôsa ek kardias
ton logon tou en kosmô hupo apistôn diôkomenon. "kai eteke", phêsin, "huion arrena, hos mellei
poimainein panta ta ethnê", ton arrena kai teleios Christon, paida Theou, Theon kai anthrôpon
katangellomenon aei tiktousa hê ekklêsia didaskei panta ta ethnê.] If we consider how Irenæus'
pupil is led by the text of the Holy Scriptures to the most diverse "doctrines," we see how
the "Scripture" theologians were the very ones who threatened the faith with the greatest corruptions.
As the exegesis of the Valentinian schools became the mother of numerous self-contradictory
Christologies, so the same result was threatened here--"doctrinæ inolescentes in silvas iam
exoleverunt Gnosticorum." From this standpoint Origen's undertaking to subject the whole material
of Biblical exegesis to a fixed theory appears in its historical greatness and importance.]

[Footnote 608: See other passages on p. 241, note 2. This is also reëchoed in Cyprian. See,
for example, ep. 58. 6: "filius dei passus est ut nos filios dei faceret, et filius hominis
(scil. the Christians) pati non vult esse dei filius possit."]

[Footnote 609: See III. 10. 3.]

[Footnote 610: See the remarkable passage in IV. 36. 7: [Greek: hê gnôsis tou huiou tou Theou,
hêtis ên aphtharsia.] Another result of the Gnostic struggle is Irenæus' raising the question
as to what new thing the Lord has brought (IV. 34. 1): "Si autem subit vos huiusmodi sensus,
ut dicatis: Quid igitur novi dominus attulit veniens? cognoscite, quoniam omnem novitatem attulit
semetipsum afferens, qui fuerat annuntiatus." The new thing is then defined thus: "Cum perceperunt
eam quæ ab eo est libertatem et participant visionem eius et audierunt sermones eius et fruiti
sunt muneribus ab eo, non iam requiretur, quid novius attulit rex super eos, qui annuntiaverunt
advenum eius ... Semetipsum enim attulit et ea quæ prædicta sunt bona."]

[Footnote 611: See IV. 36. 6: "Adhuc manifestavit oportere nos cum vocatione (i.e., [Greek:
meta tên klêsin]) et iustitiæ operibus adornari, uti requiescat super nos spiritus dei"--we
must provide ourselves with the wedding garment.]

[Footnote 612: The incapacity of man is referred to in III. 18. 1: III. 21. 10; III. 21-23
shows that the same man that had fallen had to be led to communion with God; V. 21. 3: V. 24.
4 teach that man had to overcome the devil; the intrinsic necessity of God's appearing as Redeemer
is treated of in III. 23. 1: "Si Adam iam non reverteretur ad vitam, sed in totum proiectus
esset morti, victus esset deus et superasset serpentis nequitia voluntatem dei. Sed quoniam
deus invictus et magnanimis est, magnanimem quidem se exhibuit etc." That the accomplishment
of salvation must be effected in a righteous manner, and therefore be as much a proof of the
righteousness as of the immeasurable love and mercy of God, is shown in V. 1. 1: V. 21.]

[Footnote 613: Irenæus demonstrated the view in V. 21 in great detail. According to his ideas
in this chapter we must include the history of the temptation in the regula fidei.]

[Footnote 614: See particularly V. 1. 1: "Verbum potens et homo verus sanguine suo rationabiliter
redimens nos, redemptionem semetipsum dedit pro his, qui in captivitatem ducti sunt ... del
verbum non deficiens in sua iustitia, iuste etiam adversus ipsam conversus est apostasiam,
ea quæ sunt sua redimens ab ea, non cum vi, quemadmodum ilia initio dominabatur nostri, ea
quæ non erant sua insatiabiliter rapiens, sed secundum suadelam, quemadmodum decebat deum suadentem
et non vim inferentem, accipere quæ vellet, ut neque quod est iustum confringeretur neque antiqua
plasmatio dei deperiret." We see that the idea of the blood of Christ as ransom does not possess
with Irenæus the value of a fully developed theory, but is suggestive of one. But even in this
form it appeared suspicious and, in fact, a Marcionite idea to a Catholic teacher of the 3rd
century. Pseudo-Origen (Adamantius) opposed it by the following argument (De recta in deum
fide, edit Wetstein 1673, Sectio I. p. 38 sq. See Rufinus' translation in Caspari's Kirchenhistorische
Anecdota Vol. I. 1883, p. 34 sq., which in many places has preserved the right sense): [Greek:

[Footnote 615: See Iren. V. 2, 3, 16. 3, 17-4. In III. 16. 9 he says: "Christus per passionem
reconciliavit nos deo." It is moreover very instructive to compare the way in which Irenæus
worked out the recapitulation theory with the old proof from prophecy ("this happened that
the Scripture might be fulfilled"). Here we certainly have an advance; but at bottom the recapitulation
theory may also be conceived as a modification of that proof.]

[Footnote 616: See, e.g., IV. 5. 4: [Greek: prothumôs Abraam ton idion monogenê kai agapêton
parachôrêsas thusian tô Theô, hina kai ho Theos eudokêsê huper tou spermatos autou pantos ton
idion monogenê kai agapêton huion thusian paraschein eis lutrôsin hêmeteran].]

[Footnote 617: There are not a few passages where Irenæus said that Christ has annihilated
sin, abolished Adam's disobedience, and introduced righteousness through his obedience (III.
18. 6, 7: III. 20. 2: V. 16-21); but he only once tried to explain how that is to be conceived
(III. 18. 7), and then merely reproduced Paul's thoughts.]

[Footnote 618: Irenæus has no hesitation in calling the Christian who has received the Spirit
of God the perfect, the spiritual one, and in representing him, in contrast to the false Gnostic,
as he who in truth judges all men, Jews, heathen, Marcionites, and Valentinians, but is himself
judged by no one; see the great disquisition in IV. 33 and V. 9. 10. This true Gnostic, however,
is only to be found where we meet with right faith in God the Creator, sure conviction with
regard to the God-man Jesus Christ, true knowledge as regards the Holy Spirit and the economy
of salvation, the apostolic doctrine, the right Church system in accordance with the episcopal
succession, the intact Holy Scripture, and its uncorrupted text and interpretation (IV. 33.
7, 8). To him the true believer is the real Gnostic.]

[Footnote 619: See IV. 22. In accordance with the recapitulation theory Christ must also have
descended to the lower world. There he announced forgiveness of sins to the righteous, the
patriarchs and prophets (IV. 27. 2). For this, however, Irenæus was not able to appeal to Scripture
texts, but only to statements of a presbyter. It is nevertheless expressly asserted, on the
authority of Rom. III. 23, that these pre-Christian just men also could only receive justification
and the light of salvation through the arrival of Christ among them.]

[Footnote 620: See III. 16. See, e.g., de pat. 3: "Taceo quod figitur; in hoc enim venerat";
de bapt. II: "Mors nostra dissolvi non potuit, nisi domini passione, nee vita restitui sine
resurrectione ipsius"; adv. Marc. III. 8: "Si mendacium deprehenditur Christi caro... nec passiones
Christi fidem merebuntur. Eversum est igitur totum dei opus. Totum Christiani nominis et pondus
et fructus, mors Christi, negatur, quam iam impresse apostolus demendat, utique veram, summum
eam fundamentum evangelii constituens et salutis nostræ et prædictionis suae," 1 Cor. XV. 3,
4; he follows Paul here. But on the other hand he has also adopted from Irenæus the mystical
conception of redemption--the constitution of Christ is the redemption--though with a rationalistic
explanation. See adv. Marc. II. 27: "filius miscens in semetipso hominem et deum, ut tantum
homini conferat, quantum deo detrahit. Conversabatur deus, ut homo divina agere doceretur.
Ex æquo agebat deus cum homine, ut homo ex æquo agere cum deo posset." Here therefore the meaning
of the divine manhood of the Redeemer virtually amounts to divine teaching. In de resurr. 63
Christ is called "fidelissimus sequester dei et hominum, qui et homini deum et hominem deo
reddet." Note the future tense. It is the same with Hippolytus who in Philos. X. 34 represents
the deification of men as the aim of redemption, but at the same time merely requires Christ
as the lawgiver and teacher: "[Greek: Kai tauta men ekpheuxê Theon ton onta didachtheis, exeis

Ou gar ptôcheuei Theos kai se Theon poiêsas eis doxan autou]." It is clear that with a conception
like this, which became prevalent in the 3rd century, Christ's death on the cross could have
no proper significance; nothing but the Holy Scriptures preserved its importance. We may further
remark that Tertullian used the expression "satisfacere deo" about men (see, e.g., de bapt.
20; de pud. 9), but, so far as I know, not about the work of Christ. This expression is very
frequent in Cyprian (for penances), and he also uses it about Christ. In both writers, moreover,
we find "meritum" (e.g., Scorp. 6) and "promereri deum". With them and with Novatian the idea
of "culpa" is also more strongly emphasised than it is by the Eastern theologians. Cf. Novatian
de trin. 10: "quoniam cum caro et sanguis non obtinere regnum dei scribitur, non carnis substantia
damnata est, quæ divinis manibus ne periret, exstructa est, sed sola carnis culpa merito reprehensa
est." Tertullian de bapt. 5 says: "Exempto reatu eximitur et poena." On the other hand he speaks
of fasting as "officia humiliationis", through which we can "inlicere" God. Among these Western
writers the thought that God's anger must be appeased both by sacrifices and corresponding
acts appears in a much more pronounced form than in Irenæus. This is explained by their ideas
as practical churchmen and by their actual experiences in communities that were already of
a very secular character. We may, moreover, point out in a general way that the views of Hippolytus
are everywhere more strictly dependent on Scripture texts than those of Irenæus. That many
of the latter's speculations are not found in Hippolytus is simply explained by the fact that
they have no clear scriptural basis; see Overbeck, Quæst, Hippol., Specimen p. 75, note 29.
On a superficial reading Tertullian seems to have a greater variety of points of view than
Irenæus; he has in truth fewer, he contrived to work the grains of gold transmitted to him
in such a way as to make the form more valuable than the substance. But one idea of Tertullian,
which is not found in Irenæus, and which in after times was to attain great importance in the
East (after Origen's day) and in the West (after the time of Ambrosius), may be further referred
to. We mean the notion that Christ is the bridegroom and the human soul (and also the human
body) the bride. This theologoumenon owes its origin to a combination of two older ones, and
subsequently received its Biblical basis from the Song of Solomon. The first of these older
theologoumena is the Greek philosophical notion that the divine Spirit is the bridegroom and
husband of the human soul. See the Gnostics (e.g., the sublime description in the Excerpta
ex Theodoto 27); Clem. ep. ad Jacob. 4. 6; as well as Tatian, Orat. 13; Tertull., de anima
41 fin.: "Sequitur animam nubentem spiritui caro; o beatum connubium"; and the still earlier
Sap. Sal. VIII. 2 sq. An offensively realistic form of this image is found in Clem. Horn. III.
27: [Greek: numphê gar estin ho pas anthrôpos, hopotan tou alêthous prophêtou leukô logô alêtheias
speiromenos phôtizêtai ton noun.] The second is the apostolic notion that the Church is the
bride and the body of Christ. In the 2nd Epistle of Clement the latter theologoumenon is already
applied in a modified form. Here it is said that humanity as the Church, that is human nature
(the flesh), belongs to Christ as his Eve (c. 14; see also Ignat. ad Polyc. V. 2; Tertull.
de monog. II, and my notes on [Greek: Didachê] XI. 11). The conclusion that could be drawn
from this, and that seemed to have a basis in certain utterances of Jesus, viz., that the individual
human soul together with the flesh is to be designated as the bride of Christ, was, so far
as I know, first arrived at by Tertullian de resurr. 63: "Carnem et spiritum iam in semetipso
Christus foederavit, sponsam sponso et sponsum spousæ; comparavit. Nam et si animam quis contenderit
sponsam, vel dotis nomine sequetur animam caro ... Caro est sponsa, quæ in Christo spiritum
sponsum per sanguinem pacta est"; see also de virg. vel. 16. Notice, however, that Tertullian
continually thinks of all souls together (all flesh together) rather than of the individual soul.]

[Footnote 622: By the regula inasmuch as the words "from thence he will come to judge the quick
and the dead" had a fixed place in the confessions, and the belief in the duplex adventus Christi
formed one of the most important articles of Church belief in contradistinction to Judaism
and Gnosticism (see the collection of passages in Hesse, "das Muratorische Fragment", p. 112
f.). But the belief in the return of Christ to this world necessarily involved the hope of
a kingdom of glory under Christ upon earth, and without this hope is merely a rhetorical flourish.]

[Footnote 623: Cf. here the account already given in Book I., chap. 3, Vol. I., p. 167 ff.,
Book I., chap. 4, Vol. I, p. 261, Book II., chap. 3, Vol. I, p. 105 f. On Melito compare the
testimony of Polycrates in Eusebius, H. E. V. 24. 5, and the title of his lost work "[Greek:
peri tou diabolou kai tês apokalupseôs Iôannou]." Chiliastic ideas are also found in the epistle
from Lyons in Eusebius, H. E. V. 1 sq. On Hippolytus see his work "de Christo et Antichristo"
and Overbeck's careful account (l.c., p. 70 sq.) of the agreement here existing between Irenæus
and Hippolytus as well as of the latter's chiliasm on which unfounded doubts have been cast.
Overbeck has also, in my opinion, shown the probability of chiliastic portions having been
removed at a later period both from Hippolytus' book and the great work of Irenæus. The extensive
fragments of Hippolytus' commentary on Daniel are also to be compared (and especially the portions
full of glowing hatred to Rome lately discovered by Georgiades). With reference to Tertullian
compare particularly the writings adv. Marc. III., adv. Jud., de resurrectione carnis, de anima,
and the titles of the subsequently suppressed writings de paradiso and de spe fidelium. Further
see Commodian, Carmen apolog., Lactantius, Instit. div., I. VII., Victorinus, Commentary on
the Apocalypse. It is very remarkable that Cyprian already set chiliasm aside; cf. the conclusion
of the second Book of the Testimonia and the few passages in which he quoted the last chapters
of Revelation. The Apologists were silent about chiliastic hopes, Justin even denied them in
Apol. I. 11, but, as we have remarked, he gives expression to them in the Dialogue and reckons
them necessary to complete orthodoxy. The Pauline eschatology, especially several passages
in 1 Cor. XV. (see particularly verse 50), caused great difficulties to the Fathers from Justin
downwards. See Fragm. Justini IV. a Methodic supped. in Otto, Corp. Apol. III., p. 254, Iren.
V. 9, Tertull. de resurr. 48 sq. According to Irenæus the heretics, who completely abandoned
the early-Christian eschatology, appealed to 1 Cor. XV. 50. The idea of a kind of purgatory--a
notion which does not originate with the realistic but with the philosophical eschatology--is
quite plainly found in Tertullian, e.g., in de anima 57 and 58 ("modicum delictum illuc luendum").
He speaks in several passages of stages and different places of bliss; and this was a universally
diffused idea (e.g., Scorp. 6).]

[Footnote 624: Irenæus begins with the resurrection of the body and the proofs of it (in opposition
to Gnosticism). These proofs are taken from the omnipotence and goodness of God, the long life
of the patriarchs, the translation of Enoch and Elijah, the preservation of Jonah and of the
three men in the fiery furnace, the essential nature of man as a temple of God to which the
body also belongs, and the resurrection of Christ (V. 3-7). But Irenæus sees the chief proof
in the incarnation of Christ, in the dwelling of the Spirit with its gifts in us (V. 8-16),
and in the feeding of our body with the holy eucharist (V. 2. 3). Then he discusses the defeat
of Satan by Christ (V. 21-23), shows that the powers that be are set up by God, that the devil
therefore manifestly lies in arrogating to himself the lordship of the world (V. 24), but that
he acts as a rebel and robber in attempting to make himself master of it. This brings about
the transition to Antichrist. The latter is possessed of the whole power of the devil, sums
up in himself therefore all sin and wickedness, and pretends to be Lord and God. He is described
in accordance with the Apocalypses of Daniel and John as well as according to Matth. XXIV.
and 2nd Thessalonians. He is the product of the 4th Kingdom, that is, the Roman empire; but
at the same time springs from the tribe of Dan (V. 30. 2), and will take up his abode in Jerusalem
etc. The returning Christ will destroy him, and the Christ will come back when 6000 years of
the world's history have elapsed; for "in as many days as the world was made, in so many thousands
of years will it be ended" (V. 28. 3). The seventh day is then the great world Sabbath, during
which Christ will reign with the saints of the first resurrection after the destruction of
Antichrist. Irenæus expressly argued against such "as pass for orthodox, but disregard the
order of the progress of the righteous and know no stages of preparation for incorruptibility"
(V. 31). By this he means such as assume that after death souls immediately pass to God. On
the contrary he argues that these rather wait in a hidden place for the resurrection which
takes place on the return of Christ, after which the souls receive back their bodies and men
now restored participate in the Saviour's Kingdom (V. 31. 2). This Kingdom on earth precedes
the universal judgment; "for it is just that they should also receive the fruits of their patience
in the same creation in which they suffered tribulation"; moreover, the promise made to Abraham
that Palestine would be given to him and to his seed, i.e., the Christians, must be fulfilled
(V. 32). There they will eat and drink with the Lord in the restored body (V. 33. 1) sitting
at a table covered with food (V. 33. 2) and consuming the produce of the land, which the earth
affords in miraculous fruitfulness. Here Irenæus appeals to alleged utterances of the Lord
of which he had been informed by Papias (V. 33. 3, 4). The wheat will be so fat that lions
lying peacefully beside the cattle will be able to feed themselves even on the chaff (V. 33.
3, 4). Such and similar promises are everywhere to be understood in a literal sense. Irenæus
here expressly argues against any figurative interpretation (ibid, and V. 35). He therefore
adopted the whole Jewish eschatology, the only difference being that he regards the Church
as the seed of Abraham. The earthly Kingdom is then followed by the second resurrection, the
general judgment, and the final end.]

[Footnote 625: Hippolytus in the lost book [Greek: hyper tou kata Iôannên euangeliou kai apokalupseôs].
Perhaps we may also reckon Melito among the literary defenders of Chiliasm.]

[Footnote 626: See Epiph., H. 51, who here falls back on Hippolytus.]

[Footnote 627: In the Christian village communities of the district of Arsinoe the people would
not part with chiliasm, and matters even went the length of an "apostasy" from the Alexandrian
Church. A book by an Egyptian bishop, Nepos, entitled "Refutation of the allegorists" attained
the highest repute. "They esteem the law and the prophets as nothing, neglect to follow the
Gospels, think little of the Epistles of the Apostles, and on the contrary declare the doctrine
set forth in this book to be a really great secret. They do not permit the simpler brethren
among us to obtain a sublime and grand idea of the glorious and truly divine appearance of
our Lord, of our resurrection from the dead as well as of the union and assimilation with him;
but they persuade us to hope for things petty, perishable, and similar to the present in the
kingdom of God." So Dionysius expressed himself, and these words are highly characteristic
of his own position and that of his opponents; for in fact the whole New Testament could not
but be thrust into the background in cases where the chiliastic hopes were really adhered to.
Dionysius asserts that he convinced these Churches by his lectures; but chiliasm and material
religious ideas were still long preserved in the deserts of Egypt. They were cherished by the
monks; hence Jewish Apocalypses accepted by Christians are preserved in the Coptic and Ethiopian
languages.]

[Footnote 629: It would be superfluous to quote passages here; two may stand for all Iren.
IV. 9. 1: "Utraque testamenta unus et idem paterfamilias produxit, verbum dei, dominus noster
Iesus Christus, qui et Abrahæ et Moysi collocutus est." Both Testaments are "unius et emsdem
substantiæ." IV. 2. 3: "Moysis literæ sunt verba Christi."]

[Footnote 630: See Iren. IV. 31. 1.]

[Footnote 631: Iren. III. 12. 15 (on Gal. II. 11 f.): "Sic apostoli, quos universi actus et
universæ doctrinæ dominus testes fecit, religiose agebant circa dispositionem legis, qnæ; est
secundum Moysem, ab uno et eodem significantes esse deo"; see Overbeck "Ueber die Auffassung
des Streits des Paulus mit Petrus bei den Kirchenvatern," 1877, p. 8 f. Similar remarks are
frequent in Irenæus.]

[Footnote 632: Cf., e.g., de monog. 7: "Certe sacerdotes sumus a Christo vocati, monogarniæ
debitores, ex pristina dei lege, quæ nos tune in suis sacerdotibus prophetavit." Here also
Tertullian's Montanism had an effect. Though conceiving the directions of the Paraclete as
new legislation, the Montanists would not renounce the view that these laws were in some way
already indicated in the written documents of revelation.]

[Footnote 633: Very much may be made out with regard to this from Origen's works and the later
literature, particularly from Commodian and the Apostolic Constitutions, lib. I.-VI.]

[Footnote 634: Where Christians needed the proof from prophecy or indulged in a devotional
application of the Old Testament, everything indeed remained as before, and every Old Testament
passage was taken for a Christian one, as has remained the case even to the present day.]

[Footnote 635: With the chiliastic view of history this newly acquired theory has nothing in
common.]

[Footnote 636: Iren. III. 12. 11.]

[Footnote 637: See III. 12. 12.]

[Footnote 638: No commutatio agnitionis takes place, says Irenæus, but only an increased gift
(IV. 11. 3); for the knowledge of God the Creator is "principium evangelli." (III. 11. 7).]

[Footnote 639: See IV. 11. 2 and other passages, e.g., IV. 20 7: IV. 26. 1: IV. 37. 7: IV.
38. 1-4.]

[Footnote 640: Several covenants I. 10. 3; four covenants (Adam, Noah, Moses, Christ) III.
II. 8; the two Testaments (Law and New Covenant) are very frequently mentioned.]

[Footnote 641: This is very frequently mentioned; see e.g., IV. 13. 1: "Et quia dominus naturalia
legis, per quæ homo iustificatur, quæ etiam ante legisdationem custodiebant qui fide iustificabantur
et placebant deo non dissolvit etc." IV. 15, 1.]

[Footnote 642: Irenæus, as a rule, views the patriarchs as perfect saints; see III. II. 8:
"Verbum dei illis quidem qui ante Moysem fuerunt patriarchis secundum divinitatem et gloriam
colloquebatur", and especially IV. 16. 3. As to the Son's having descended from the beginning
and having thus appeared to the patriarchs also, see IV. 6. 7. Not merely Abraham but all the
other exponents of revelation knew both the Father and the Son. Nevertheless Christ was also
obliged to descend to the lower world to the righteous, the prophets, and the patriarchs, in
order to bring them forgiveness of sins (IV. 27. 2).]

[Footnote 643: On the contrary he agrees with the teachings of a presbyter, whom he frequently
quotes in the 4th Book. To Irenæus the heathen are simply idolaters who have even forgotten
the law written in the heart; wherefore the Jews stand much higher, for they only lacked the
agnitio filii. See III. 5. 3: III. 10. 3: III. 12. 7, IV. 23, 24. Yet there is still a great
want of clearness here. Irenæus cannot get rid of the following contradictions. The pre-Christian
righteous know the Son and do not know him; they require the appearance of the Son and do not
require it; and the agnitio filii seems sometimes a new, and in fact the decisive, veritas,
and sometimes that involved in the knowledge of God the Creator.]

[Footnote 644: Irenæus IV. 16. 3. See IV. 15. 1: "Decalogum si quis non fecerit, non habet
salutem".]

[Footnote 645: As the Son has manifested the Father from of old, so also the law, and indeed
even the ceremonial law, is to be traced back to him. See IV. 6. 7: IV. 12. 4: IV. 14. 2: "his
qui inquieti erant in eremo dans aptissimam legem ... per omnes transiens verbum omni conditioni
congruentem et aptam legem conscribens". IV. 4. 2. The law is a law of bondage; it was just
in that capacity that it was necessary; see IV. 4. 1: IV. 9. 1: IV. 13. 2, 4: IV. 14. 3: IV.
15: IV. 16: IV. 32: IV. 36. A part of the commandments are concessions on account of hardness
of heart (IV. 15. 2). But Irenæus still distinguishes very decidedly between the "people" and
the prophets. This is a survival of the old view. The prophets he said knew very well of the
coming of the Son of God and the granting of a new covenant (IV. 9. 3: IV. 20. 4, 5: IV. 33.
10); they understood what was typified by the ceremonial law, and to them accordingly the law
had only a typical signification. Moreover, Christ himself came to them ever and anon through
the prophetic spirit. The preparation for the new covenant is therefore found in the prophets
and in the typical character of the old. Abraham has this peculiarity, that both Testaments
were prefigured in him: the Testament of faith, because he was justified before his circumcision,
and the Testament of the law. The latter occupied "the middle times", and therefore come in
between (IV. 25. 1). This is a Pauline thought, though otherwise indeed there is not much in
Irenæus to remind us of Paul, because he used the moral categories, growth and training, instead
of the religious ones, sin and grace.]

[Footnote 646: The law, i.e., the ceremonial law, reaches down to John, IV. 4. 2. The New Testament
is a law of freedom, because through it we are adopted as sons of God, III. 5. 3: III. 10.
5: III. 12. 5: III. 12. 14: III. 15. 3: IV. 9. 1, 2: IV. 11. 1: IV. 13. 2, 4: IV. 15. 1, 2:
IV. 16. 5: IV. 18: IV. 32: IV. 34. 1: IV. 36. 2. Christ did not abolish the natus alia legis,
the Decalogue, but extended and fulfilled them; here the old Gentile-Christian moral conception
based on the Sermon on the Mount, prevails. Accordingly Irenæus now shows that in the case
of the children of freedom the situation has become much more serious, and that the judgments
are now much more threatening. Finally, he proves that the fulfilling, extending, and sharpening
of the law form a contrast to the blunting of the natural moral law by the Pharisees and elders;
see IV. 12. 1 ff.: "Austero dei præcepto miscent seniores aquatam traditionem". IV. 13. 1.
f.: "Christus naturalia legis (which are summed up in the commandment of love) extendit et
implevit ... plenitudo et extensio ... necesse fuit, auferri quidem vincula servitutis, superextendi
vero decreta libertatis". That is proved in the next passage from the Sermon on the Mount:
we must not only refrain from evil works, but also from evil desire. IV. 16. 5: "Hæc ergo,
quæ in servitutem et in signum data sunt illis, circumscripsit novo libertatis testamento.
Quæ autem naturalia et liberalia et communia omnium, auxit et dilatavit, sine invidia largiter
donans hominibus per adoptionem, patrem scire deum ... auxit autem etiam timorem: filios enim
plus timere oportet quam servos". IV. 27. 2. The new situation is a more serious one; the Old
Testament believers have the death of Christ as an antidote for their sins, "propter eos vero,
qui nunc peccant, Christus non iam morietur". IV. 28. 1 f.: under the old covenant God punished
"typice et temporaliter et mediocrius", under the new, on the contrary, "vere et semper et
austerius" ... as under the new covenant "fides aucta est", so also it is true that "diligentia
conversationis adaucta est". The imperfections of the law, the "particularia legis", the law
of bondage have been abolished by Christ, see specially IV. 16, 17, for the types are now fulfilled;
but Christ and the Apostles did not transgress the law; freedom was first granted to the Gentile
Christians (III. 12) and circumcision and foreskin united (III. 5. 3). But Irenæus also proved
how little the old and new covenants contradict each other by showing that the latter also
contains concessions that have been granted to the frailty of man; see IV. 15. 2 (1 Cor. VII.).]

[Footnote 647: See III. II. 4. There too we find it argued that John the Baptist was not merely
a prophet, but also an Apostle.]

[Footnote 648: From Irenæus' statement in IV. 4 about the significance of the city of Jerusalem
we can infer what he thought of the Jewish nation. Jerusalem is to him the vine-branch on which
the fruit has grown; the latter having reached maturity, the branch is cut off and has no further
importance.]

[Footnote 649: No special treatment of Tertullian is required here, as he only differs from
Irenæus in the additions he invented as a Montanist. Yet this is also prefigured in Irenæus'
view that the concessions of the Apostles had rendered the execution of the stern new law more
easy. A few passages may be quoted here. De orat. I: "Quidquid retro fuerat, aut demutatum
est (per Christum), ut circumcisio, aut suppletum ut reliqua lex, aut impletum ut prophetia,
aut perfectum ut fides ipsa. Omnia de carnalibus in spiritalia renovavit nova dei gratia superducto
evangelio, expunctore totius retro vetustatis." (This differentiation strikingly reminds us
of the letter of Ptolemy to Flora. Ptolemy distinguishes those parts of the law that originate
with God, Moses, and the elders. As far as the divine law is concerned, he again distinguishes
what Christ had to complete, what he had to supersede and what he had to spiritualise, that
is, perficere, solvere, demutare). In the regula fidei (de præscr. 13): "Christus prædicavit
novam legem et novam promissionem regni coelorum"; see the discussions in adv. Marc. II., III.,
and adv. Iud.; de pat. 6: "amplianda adimplendaque lex." Scorp. 3, 8, 9; ad uxor. 2; de monog.
7: "Et quoniam quidam interdum nihil sihi dicunt esse cum lege, quam Christus non dissolvit,
sed adimplevit, interdum quæ volunt legis arripiunt (he himself did that continually), plane
et nos sic dicimus legem, ut onera quidem eius, secundum sententiam apostolorum, quæ nec patres
sustinere valuerunt, concesserint, quæ vero ad iustitiam spectant, non tantum reservata permaneant,
verum et ampliata." That the new law of the new covenant is the moral law of nature in a stricter
form, and that the concessions of the Apostle Paul cease in the age of the Paraclete, is a
view we find still more strongly emphasised in the Montanist writings than in Irenæus. In ad
uxor. 3 Tertullian had already said: "Quod permittitur, bonum non est," and this proposition
is the theme of many arguments in the Montanist writings. But the intention of finding a basis
for the laws of the Paraclete, by showing that they existed in some fashion even in earlier
times, involved Tertullian in many contradictions. It is evident from his writings that Montanists
and Catholics in Carthage alternately reproached each other with judaising tendencies and an
apostasy to heathen discipline and worship. Tertullian, in his enthusiasm for Christianity,
came into conflict with all the authorities which he himself had set up. In the questions as
to the relationship of the Old Testament to the New, of Christ to the Apostles, of the Apostles
to each other, of the Paraclete to Christ and the Apostles, he was also of necessity involved
in the greatest contradictions. This was the case not only because he went more into details
than Irenæus; but, above all, because the chains into which he had thrown his Christianity
were felt to be such by himself. This theologian had no greater opponent than himself, and
nowhere perhaps is this so plain as in his attitude to the two Testaments. Here, in every question
of detail, Tertullian really repudiated the proposition from which he starts. In reference
to one point, namely, that the Law and the prophets extend down to John, see Noldechen's article
in the Zeitschrift fur wissenschaftliche Theologie, 1885, p. 333 f. On the one hand, in order
to support certain trains of thought, Tertullian required the proposition that prophecy extended
down to John (see also the Muratorian Fragment: "completus numerus prophetarum", Sibyll. I.
386: [Greek: kai tote dê pausis estai metepeita prophêtôu], scil. after Christ), and on the
other, as a Montanist, he was obliged to assert the continued existence of prophecy. In like
manner he sometimes ascribed to the Apostles a unique possession of the Holy Spirit, and at
other times, adhering to a primitive Christian idea, he denied this thesis. Cf. also Baith
"Tertullian's Auffassung des Apostels Paulus und seines Verhaltnisses zu den Uraposteln" (Jahrbuch
fur protestantische Theologie, Vol. III. p. 706 ff.). Tertullian strove to reconcile the principles
of early Christianity with the authority of ecclesiastical tradition and philosophical apologetics.
Separated from the general body of the Church, and making ever increasing sacrifices for the
early-Christian enthusiasm, as he understood it, he wasted himself in the solution of this
insoluble problem.]

[Footnote 650: In addition to this, however, they definitely established within the Church
the idea that there is a "Christian" view in all spheres of life and in all questions of knowledge.
Christianity appears expanded to an immense, immeasurable breadth. This is also Gnosticism.
Thus Tertullian, after expressing various opinions about dreams, opens the 45th chapter of
his work "de anima" with the words: "Tenemur hie de sommis quoque Christianam sententiam expromere".
Alongside of the antignostic rule of faith as the "doctrine" we find the casuistic system of
morality and penance (the Church "disciplina") with its media of almsgiving, fasting, and prayer;
see Cypr, de op et eleemos., but before that Hippol., Comm. in Daniel ([Greek: Ekkl Alêth].
1886, p. 242): [Greek: hoi eis tu onoma ton Theou pisteuontes kai di' agathoergias to prosôpon
autou exilaskomenoi.]]

[Footnote 651: In the case of Irenæus, Hippolytus, and Tertullian we already find that they
observe a certain order and sequence of books when advancing a detailed proof from Scripture.]

[Footnote 652: It is worthy of note that there was not a single Arian ecclesiastic of note
in the Novatian churches of the 4th century, so far as we know. All Novatian's adherents, even
those in the West (see Socrates' Ecclesiastical History), were of the orthodox Nicæan type.
This furnishes material for reflection.]

[Footnote 653: Owing to the importance of the matter we shall give several Christological and
trinitarian disquisitions from the work "de trinitate". The archaic attitude of this Christology
and trinitarian doctrine is evident from the following considerations. (1) Like Tertullian,
Novatian asserts that the Logos was indeed always with the Father, but that he only went forth
from him at a definite period of time (for the purpose of creating the world). (2) Like Tertullian,
he declares that Father, Son, and Spirit have one substance (that is, are [Greek: homoousioi],
the homoousia of itself never decides as to equality in dignity); but that the Son is subordinate
and obedient to the Father and the Spirit to the Son (cc. 17, 22, 24), since they derive their
origin, essence, and function from the Father (the Spirit from the Son). (3) Like Tertullian,
Novatian teaches that the Son, after accomplishing his work, will again become intermingled
with the Father, that is, will cease to have an independent existence (c. 31); whence we understand
why the West continued so long to be favourable to Marcellus of Ancyra; see also the so-called
symbol of Sardika. Apart from these points and a few others of less consequence, the work,
in its formulæ, exhibits a type which remained pretty constant in the West down to the time
of Augustine, or, till the adoption of Johannes Damascenus' dogmatic. The sharp distinction
between "deus" and "homo" and the use that is nevertheless made of "permixtio" and synonymous
words are also specially characteristic. Cap. 9: "Christus deus dominus deus noster, sed dei
filius"; c. 11: "non sic de substantia corporis ipsius exprimimus, ut solum tantum hominem
illum esse dicamus, sed ut divinitate sermonis in ipsa concretione permixta etiam deum illum
teneamus"; c. 11 Christ has auctoritas divina, "tam enim scriptura etiam deum adnuntiat Christum,
quam etiam ipsum hominem adnuntiat deum, tam hominem descripsit Iesum Christum, quam etiam
deum quoque descripsit Christum dominum." In c. 12 the term "Immanuel" is used to designate
Christ as God in a way that reminds one of Athanasius; c. 13: "præsertim cum animadvertat,
scripturam evangelicam utramque istam substantiam in unam nativitatis Christi foederasse concordiam";
c. 14: "Christus ex verbi et carnis coniunctione concretus"; c. 16: "... ut neque homo Christo
subtrahatur, neque divinitas negetur ... utrumque in Christo confoederatum est, utrumque coniunctum
est et utrumque connexum est ... pignerata in illo divinitatis et humilitatis videtur esse
concordia ... qui mediator dei et hominum effectus exprimitur, in se deum et hominem sociasse
reperitur ... nos sermonem dei scimus indutum carnis substantiam ... lavit substantiam corporis
et materiam carnis abluens, ex parte suscepti hominis, passione"; c. 17: "... nisi quoniam
auctoritas divini verbi ad suscipiendum hominem interim conquiescens nec se suis viribus exercens,
deiicit se ad tempus atque deponit, dum hominem fert, quem suscepit"; c. 18: "... ut in semetipso
concordiam confibularet terrenorum pariter atque cælestium, dum utriusque partis in se connectens
pignora et deum homini et hominem deo copularet, ut merito filius dei per assumptionem carnis
filius hominis et filius hominis per receptionem dei verbi filius dei effici possit"; c. 19:
"hic est enim legitimus dei filius qui ex ipso deo est, qui, dum sanctum illud (Luke I. 35)
assumit, sibi filium hominis annectit et illum ad se rapit atque transducit, connexione sua
et permixtione sociata præstat et filium illum dei facit, quod ille naturaliter non fuit (Novatian's
teaching is therefore like that of the Spanish Adoptionists of the 8th century), ut principalitas
nominis istius 'filius dei' in spiritu sit domini, qui descendit et venit, ut sequela nominis
istius in filio dei et hominis sit, et merito consequenter his filius dei factus sit, dum non
principaliter filius dei est, atque ideo dispositionem istam anhelus videns et ordinem istum
sacramenti expediens non sic cuncta confundens, ut nullum vestigium distinctionis collocavit,
distinctionem posuit dicendo. 'Propterea et quod nascetur ex te sanctum vocabitur filius dei'.
Ne si distributionem istam cum libramentis suis non dispensasset, sed in confuso permixtum
reliquisset, vere occasionem hæreticis contulisset, ut hominis filium qua homo est, eundum
et dei et hominis filium pronuntiare deberent.... Filius dei, dum filium hominis in se suscepit,
consequenter illum filium dei fecit, quoniam illum filius sibi dei sociavit et iunxit, ut,
dum filius hominis adhæret in nativitate filio dei, ipsa permixtionem foeneratum et mutuatum
teneret, quod ex natura propria possidere non posset. Ac si facta est angeli voce, quod nolunt
hæretici, inter filium dei hominisque cum sua tamen sociatione distinctio, urgendo illos, uti
Christum hominis filium hominem intelligant quoque dei filium et hominem dei filium id est
dei verbum deum accipiant, atque ideo Christum Iesum dominum ex utroque connexum, et utroque
contextum atque concretum et in eadem utriusque substantiæ concordia mutui ad invicem foederis
confibulatione sociatum, hominem et deum, scripturæ hoc ipsum dicentis veritate cognoscant".
c. 21: "hæretici nolunt Christum secundam esse personam post patrem, sed ipsum patrem;" c.
22: "Cum Christus 'Ego' dicit (John X. 30), deinde patrem infert dicendo, 'Ego et pater', proprietatem
personæ suæ id est filii a paterna auctoritate discernit atque distinguit, non tantummodo de
sono nominis, sed etiam de ordine dispositæ potestatis ... unum enim neutraliter positum, societatis
concordiam, non unitatem personæ sonat ... unum autem quod ait, ad concordiam et eandem sententiam
et ad ipsam charitatis societatem pertinet, ut merito unum sit pater et filius per concordiam
et per amorem et per dilectionem. Et quoniam ex patre est, quicquid illud est, filius est,
manente tamen distinctione ... denique novit hanc concordiæ unitatem est apostolus Paulus cum
personarum tamen distinctione." (Comparison with the relationship between Paul and Apollos!
"Quos personæ ratio invicem dividit, eosdem rursus invicem religionis ratio conducit; et quamvis
idem atque ipsi non sint, dum idem sentiunt, ipsum sunt, et cum duo sint, unum sunt"); c. 23:
"constat hominem a deo factum esse, non ex deo processisse; ex deo autem homo quomodo nou processit,
sic dei verbum processit". In c. 24 it is argued that Christ existed before the creation of
the world and that not merely "predestinatione", for then he would be subsequent and therefore
inferior to Adam, Abel, Enoch etc. "Sublata ergo prædestinatione quæ non est posita, in substantia
fuit Christus ante mundi institutionem"; c. 31: "Est ergo deus pater omnium institutor et creator,
solus originem nesciens(!), invisibilis, immensus, immortalis, æternus, unus deus(!), ... ex
quo quando ipse voluit, sermo filius natus est, qui non in sono percussi aeris aut tono coactæ
de visceribus vocis accipitur, sed in substantia prolatæ a deo virtutis agnoscitur, cuius sacræ

[Footnote 654: If I am not mistaken, the production or adaptation of Apocalypses did indeed
abate in the third century, but acquired fresh vigour in the 4th, though at the same time allowing
greater scope to the influence of heathen literature (including romances as well as hagiographical
literature).]

The Alexandrian school of catechists was of inestimable importance for the transformation of
the heathen empire into a Christian one, and of Greek philosophy into ecclesiastical philosophy.
In the third century this school overthrew polytheism by scientific means whilst at the same
time preserving everything of any value in Greek science and culture. These Alexandrians wrote
for the educated people of the whole earth; they made Christianity a part of the civilisation
of the world. The saying that the Christian missionary to the Greeks must be a Greek was first
completely verified within the Catholic Church in the person of Origen, who at the same time
produced the only system of Christian dogma possessed by the Greek Church before John Damascenus.

1. The Alexandrian Catechetical School. Clement of Alexandria.[656]

"The work of Irenæus still leaves it undecided whether the form of the world's literature,
as found in the Christian Church, is destined only to remain a weapon to combat its enemies,
or is to become an instrument of peaceful labour within its own territory." With these words
Overbeck has introduced his examination of Clement of Alexandria's great masterpiece from the
standpoint of the historian of literature. They may be also applied to the history of theology.
As we have shown, Irenæus, Tertullian (and Hippolytus) made use of philosophical theology to
expel heretical elements; but all the theological expositions that this interest suggested
to them as necessary, were in their view part of the faith itself. At least we find in their
works absolutely no clear expression of the fact that faith is one thing and theology another,
though rudimentary indications of such distinctions are found. Moreover, their adherence to
the early-Christian eschatology in its entirety, as well as their rejection of a qualitative
distinction between simple believers and "Gnostics," proved that they themselves were deceived
as to the scope of their theological speculations, and that moreover their Christian interest
was virtually satisfied with subjection to the authority of tradition, with the early-Christian
hopes, and with the rules for a holy life. But since about the time of Commodus, and in some
cases even earlier, we can observe, even in ecclesiastical circles, the growing independence
and might of the aspiration for a scientific knowledge and treatment of the Christian religion,
that is of Christian tradition.[657] There is a wish to maintain this tradition in its entirety
and hence the Gnostic theses are rejected. The selection from tradition, made in opposition
to Gnosticism--though indeed in accordance with its methods--and declared to be apostolic,
is accepted. But there is a desire to treat the given material in a strictly scientific manner,
just as the Gnostics had formerly done, that is, on the one hand to establish it by a critical
and historical exegesis, and on the other to give it a philosophical form and bring it into
harmony with the spirit of the times. Along with this we also find the wish to incorporate
the thoughts of Paul which now possessed divine authority.[658] Accordingly schools and scholastic
unions now make their appearance afresh, the old schools having been expelled from the Church.[659]
In Asia Minor such efforts had already begun shortly before the time when the canon of holy
apostolic tradition was fixed by the ecclesiastical authorities (Alogi). From the history of
Clement of Alexandria, the life of bishop Alexander, afterwards bishop of Jerusalem, and subsequently
from the history of Origen (we may also mention Firmilian of Cæsarea), we learn that there
was in Cappadocia about the year 200 a circle of ecclesiastics who zealously applied themselves
to scientific pursuits. Bardesanes, a man of high repute, laboured in the Christian kingdom
of Edessa about the same time. He wrote treatises on philosophical theology, which indeed,
judged by a Western standard, could not be accounted orthodox, and directed a theological school
which maintained its ground in the third century and attained great importance.[660] In Palestine,
during the time of Heliogabalus and Alexander (Severus), Julius Africanus composed a series
of books on scientific theology, which were specifically different from the writings of Irenæus
and Tertullian; but which on the other hand show the closest relationship in point of form
to the treatises of the so-called Gnostics. His inquiries into the relationship of the genealogies
of Jesus and into certain parts of the Greek Apocalypse of Daniel showed that the Church's
attention had been drawn to problems of historical criticism. In his chronography the apologetic
interest is subordinate to the historical, and in his [Greek: Kestoi], dedicated to Alexander
Severus (Hippolytus had already dedicated a treatise on the resurrection to the wife of Heliogabalus),
we see fewer traces of the Christian than of the Greek scholar. Alexander of Ælia and Theoktistus
of Cæsarea, the occupants of the two most important sees in Palestine, were, contemporaneously
with him, zealous patrons of an independent science of theology. Even at that early time the
former founded an important theological library; and the fragments of his letters preserved
to us prove that he had caught not only the language, but also the scientific spirit of the
age. In Rome, at the beginning of the third century, there was a scientific school where textual
criticism of the Bible was pursued and where the works of Aristotle, Theophrastus, Euclid,
and Galen were zealously read and utilised. Finally, the works of Tertullian show us that,
even among the Christians of Carthage, there was no lack of such as wished to naturalise the
pursuit of science within the Church; and Eusebius (H. E. V. 27) has transmitted to us the
titles of a series of scientific works dating as far back as the year 200 and ascribed to ecclesiastics
of that period.

Whilst all these phenomena, which collectively belong to the close of the second and beginning
of the third century, show that it was indeed possible to suppress heresy in the Church, but
not the impulse from which it sprang, the most striking proof of this conclusion is the existence
of the so-called school of catechists in Alexandria. We cannot now trace the origin of this
school, which first comes under our notice in the year 190,[661] but we know that the struggle
of the Church with heresy was concluded in Alexandria at a later period than in the West. We
know further that the school of catechists extended its labours to Palestine and Cappadocia
as early as the year 200, and, to all appearance, originated or encouraged scientific pursuits
there.[662] Finally, we know that the existence of this school was threatened in the fourth
decade of the third century; but Heraclas was shrewd enough to reconcile the ecclesiastical
and scientific interests.[663] In the Alexandrian school of catechists the whole of Greek science
was taught and made to serve the purpose of Christian apologetics. Its first teacher, who is
well known to us from the writings he has left, is Clement of Alexandria.[664] His main work
is epoch-making. "Clement's intention is nothing less than an introduction to Christianity,
or, speaking more correctly and in accordance with the spirit of his work, an initiation into
it. The task that Clement sets himself is an introduction to what is inmost and highest in
Christianity itself. He aims, so to speak, at first making Christians perfect Christians by
means of a work of literature. By means of such a work he wished not merely to repeat to the
Christian what life has already done for him as it is, but to elevate him to something still
higher than what has been revealed to him by the forms of initiation that the Church has created
for herself in the course of a history already dating back a century and a half." To Clement
therefore Gnosis, that is, the (Greek) philosophy of religion, is not only a means of refuting
heathenism and heresy, but at the same time of ascertaining and setting forth what is highest
and inmost in Christianity. He views it as such, however, because, apart from evangelical sayings,
the Church tradition, both collectively and in its details, is something foreign to him; he
has subjected himself to its authority, but he can only make it intellectually his own after
subjecting it to a scientific and philosophical treatment.[665] His great work, which has rightly
been called the boldest literary undertaking in the history of the Church,[666] is consequently
the first attempt to use Holy Scripture and the Church tradition together with the assumption
that Christ as the Reason of the world is the source of all truth, as the basis of a presentation
of Christianity which at once addresses itself to the cultured by satisfying the scientific
demand for a philosophical ethic and theory of the world, and at the same time reveals to the
believer the rich content of his faith. Here then is found, in form and content, the scientific
Christian doctrine of religion which, while not contradicting the faith, does not merely support
or explain it in a few places, but raises it to another and higher intellectual sphere, namely,
out of the province of authority and obedience into that of clear knowledge and inward, intellectual
assent emanating from love to God.[667] Clement cannot imagine that the Christian faith, as
found in tradition, can of itself produce the union of intellectual independence and devotion
to God which he regards as moral perfection. He is too much of a Greek philosopher for that,
and believes that this aim is only reached through knowledge. But in so far as this is only
the deciphering of the secrets revealed in the Holy Scriptures through the Logos, secrets which
the believer also gains possession of by subjecting himself to them, all knowledge is a reflection
of the divine revelation. The lofty ethical and religious ideal of the man made perfect in
fellowship with God, which Greek philosophy had developed since the time of Plato and to which
it had subordinated the whole scientific knowledge of the world, was adopted and heightened
by Clement, and associated not only with Jesus Christ but also with ecclesiastical Christianity.
But, whilst connecting it with the Church tradition, he did not shrink from the boldest remodelling
of the latter, because the preservation of its wording was to him a sufficient guarantee of
the Christian character of the speculation.[668] In Clement, then, ecclesiastical Christianity
reached the stage that Judaism had attained in Philo, and no doubt the latter exercised great
influence over him.[669] Moreover, Clement stands on the ground that Justin had already trodden,
but he has advanced far beyond this Apologist. His superiority to Justin not only consists
in the fact that he changed the apologetic task that the latter had in his mind into a systematic
and positive one; but above all in the circumstance that he transformed the tradition of the
Christian Church, which in his days was far more extensive and more firmly established than
in Justin's time, into a real scientific dogmatic; whereas Justin neutralised the greater part
of this tradition by including it in the scheme of the proof from prophecy. By elevating the
idea of the Logos who is Christ into the highest principle in the religious explanation of
the world and in the exposition of Christianity, Clement gave to this idea a much more concrete
and copious content than Justin did. Christianity is the doctrine of the creation, training,
and redemption of mankind by the Logos, whose work culminates in the perfect Gnostics. The
philosophy of the Greeks, in so far as it possessed the Logos, is declared to be a counterpart
of the Old Testament law;[670] and the facts contained in the Church tradition are either subordinated
to the philosophical dogmatic or receive a new interpretation expressly suited to it. The idea
of the Logos has a content which is on the one hand so wide that he is found wherever man rises
above the level of nature, and on the other so concrete that an authentic knowledge of him
can only be obtained from historical revelation. The Logos is essentially the rational law
of the world and the teacher; but in Christ he is at the same time officiating priest, and
the blessings he bestows are a series of holy initiations which alone contain the possibility
of man's raising himself to the divine life.[671] While this is already clear evidence of Clement's
affinity to Gnostic teachers, especially the Valentinians, the same similarity may also be
traced in the whole conception of the task (Christianity as theology), in the determination
of the formal principle (inclusive of the recourse to esoteric tradition; see above, p. 35
f.),[672] and in the solution of the problems. But Clement's great superiority to Valentinus
is shown not only in his contriving to preserve in all points his connection with the faith
of the main body of Christendom, but still more in his power of mastering so many problems
by the aid of a single principle, that is, in the art of giving the most comprehensive presentation
with the most insignificant means. Both facts are indeed most closely connected. The rejection
of all conceptions that could not be verified from Holy Scripture, or at least easily reconciled
with it, as well as his optimism, opposed as this was to Gnostic pessimism, proved perhaps
the most effective means of persuading the Church to recognise the Christian character of a
dogmatic that was at least half inimical to ecclesiastical Christianity. Through Clement theology
became the crowning stage of piety, the highest philosophy of the Greeks was placed under the
protection and guarantee of the Church, and the whole Hellenic civilisation was thus at the
same time legitimised within Christianity. The Logos is Christ, but the Logos is at the same
time the moral and rational in all stages of development. The Logos is the teacher, not only
in cases where an intelligent self-restraint, as understood by the ancients, bridles the passions
and instincts and wards off excesses of all sorts; but also, and here of course the revelation
is of a higher kind, wherever love to God alone determines the whole life and exalts man above
everything sensuous and finite.[673] What Gnostic moralists merely regarded as contrasts Clement,
the Christian and Greek, was able to view as stages; and thus he succeeded in conceiving the
motley society that already represented the Church of his time as a unity, as the humanity
trained by one and the same Logos, the Pedagogue. His speculation did not drive him out of
the Church; it rather enabled him to understand the multiplicity of forms she contained and
to estimate their relative justification; nay, it finally led him to include the history of
pre-Christian humanity in the system he regarded as a unity, and to form a theory of universal
history satisfactory to his mind.[674] If we compare this theory with the rudimentary ideas
of a similar kind in Irenæus, we see clearly the meagreness and want of freedom, the uncertainty
and narrowness, in the case of the latter. In the Christian faith as he understood it and as
amalgamated by him with Greek culture, Clement found intellectual freedom and independence,
deliverance from all external authority. We need not here directly discuss what apparatus he
used for this end. Irenæus again remained entangled in his apparatus, and much as he speaks
of the novum testamentum libertatis, his great work little conveys the impression that its
author has really attained intellectual freedom. Clement was the first to grasp the task of
future theology. According to him this task consists in utilising the historical traditions,
through which we have become what we are, and the Christian communion, which is imperative
upon us as being the only moral and religious one, in order to attain freedom and independence
of our own life by the aid of the Gospel; and in showing this Gospel to be the highest revelation
by the Logos, who has given evidence of himself whenever man rises above the level of nature
and who is consequently to be traced throughout the whole history of humanity.

But does the Christianity of Clement correspond to the Gospel? We can only give a qualified
affirmation to this question. For the danger of secularisation is evident, since apostasy from
the Gospel would be completely accomplished as soon as the ideal of the self-sufficient Greek
sage came to supplant the feeling that man lives by the grace of God. But the danger of secularisation
lies in the cramped conception of Irenæus, who sets up authorities which have nothing to do
with the Gospel, and creates facts of salvation which have a no less deadening effect though
in a different way. If the Gospel is meant to give freedom and peace in God, and to accustom
us to an eternal life in union with Christ Clement understood this meaning. He could justly
say to his opponents: "If the things we say appear to some people diverse from the Scriptures
of the Lord, let them know that they draw inspiration and life therefrom and, making these
their starting-point give their meaning only, not their letter" ([Greek: kan heteroia tisi
tôn pollôn kataphainêtai ta hyph' hêmôn legomena tôn kyriakôn graphôn, isteon hoti ekeithen
anapnei te kai zê kai tas aphormas ap' autôn echonta ton noun monon, ou tên lexin, paristan
epangelletai]).[675] No doubt Clement conceives the aim of the whole traditionary material
to be that of Greek philosophy, but we cannot fail to perceive that this aim is blended with
the object which the Gospel puts before us, namely, to be rich in God and to receive strength
and life from him. The goodness of God and the responsibility of man are the central ideas
of Clement and the Alexandrians; they also occupy the foremost place in the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. If this is certain we must avoid that searching of the heart which undertakes to fix
how far he was influenced by the Gospel and how far by philosophy.

But, while so judging, we cannot deny that the Church tradition was here completely transformed
into a Greek philosophy of religion on a historical basis, nor do we certify the Christian
character of Clement's "dogmas" in acknowledging the evangelical spirit of his practical position.
What would be left of Christianity, if the practical aim, given by Clement to this religious
philosophy, were lost? A depotentiated system which could absolutely no longer be called Christian.
On the other hand there were many valuable features in the ecclesiastical regula literally
interpreted; and the attempts of Irenæus to extract an authoritative religious meaning from
the literal sense of Church tradition and of New Testament passages must be regarded as conservative
efforts of the most valuable kind. No doubt Irenæus and his theological confrères did not themselves
find in Christianity that freedom which is its highest aim; but on the other hand they preserved
and rescued valuable material for succeeding times. If some day trust in the methods of religious
philosophy vanishes, men will revert to history, which will still be recognisable in the preserved
tradition, as prized by Irenæus and the rest, whereas it will have almost perished in the artificial
interpretations due to the speculations of religious philosophers.

The importance that the Alexandrian school was to attain in the history of dogma is not associated
with Clement, but with his disciple Origen.[676] This was not because Clement was more heterodox
than Origen, for that is not the case, so far as the Stromateis is concerned at least;[677]
but because the latter exerted an incomparably greater influence than the former; and, with
an energy perhaps unexampled in the history of the Church, already mapped out all the provinces
of theology by his own unaided efforts. Another reason is that Clement did not possess the
Church tradition in its fixed Catholic forms as Origen did (see above, chapter 2), and, as
his Stromateis shows, he was as yet incapable of forming a theological system. What he offers
is portions of a theological Christian dogmatic and speculative ethic. These indeed are no
fragments in so far as they are all produced according to a definite method and have the same
object in view, but they still want unity. On the other hand Origen succeeded in forming a
complete system inasmuch as he not only had a Catholic tradition of fixed limits and definite
type to fall back upon as a basis; but was also enabled by the previous efforts of Clement
to furnish a methodical treatment of this tradition.[678] Now a sharp eye indeed perceives
that Origen personally no longer possessed such a complete and bold religious theory of the
world as Clement did, for he was already more tightly fettered by the Church tradition, some
details of which here and there led him into compromises that remind us of Irenæus; but it
was in connection with his work that the development of the following period took place. It
is therefore sufficient, within the framework of the history of dogma, to refer to Clement
as the bold forerunner of Origen, and, in setting forth the theology of the latter, to compare
it in important points with the doctrines of Clement.

2. The system of Origen.[679]

Among the theologians of ecclesiastical antiquity Origen was the most important and influential
alongside of Augustine. He proved the father of ecclesiastical science in the widest sense
of the word, and at the same time became the founder of that theology which reached its complete
development in the fourth and fifth centuries, and which in the sixth definitely denied its
author, without, however, losing the form he had impressed on it. Origen created the ecclesiastical
dogmatic and made the sources of the Jewish and Christian religion the foundation of that science.
The Apologists, in their day, had found everything clear in Christianity; the antignostic Fathers
had confused the Church's faith and the science that treats of it. Origen recognised the problem
and the problems, and elevated the pursuit of Christian theology to the rank of an independent
task by freeing it from its polemical aim. He could not have become what he did, if two generations
had not preceded him in paving the way to form a mental conception of Christianity and give
it a philosophical foundation. Like all epoch-making personalities, he was also favoured by
the conditions in which he lived, though he had to endure violent attacks. Born of a Christian
family which was faithfully attached to the Church, he lived at a time when the Christian communities
enjoyed almost uninterrupted peace and were being naturalised in the world; he was a member
of a Christian Church where the right of scientific study was already recognised and where
this had attained a fixed position in an organised school.[680] He proclaimed the reconciliation
of science with the Christian faith and the compatibility of the highest culture with the Gospel
within the bosom of the Church, thus contributing more than any other to convert the ancient
world to Christianity. But he made no compromises from shrewd calculation: it was his inmost
and holiest conviction that the sacred documents of Christianity contained all the ideals of
antiquity, and that the speculative conception of ecclesiastical Christianity was the only
true and right one. His character was pure, his life blameless; in his work he was not only
unwearied, but also unselfish. There have been few Fathers of the Church whose life-story leaves
such an impression of purity behind it as that of Origen. The atmosphere which he breathed
as a Christian and as a philosopher was dangerous; but his mind remained sound, and even his
feeling for truth scarcely ever forsook him.[681] To us his theory of the world, surveyed in
its details, presents various changing hues, like that of Philo, and at the present day we
can scarcely any longer understand how he was able to unite the different materials; but, considering
the solidity of his character and the confidence of his decisions, we cannot doubt that he
himself felt the agreement of all essential parts of his system. No doubt he spoke in one way
to the perfect and in another to the mass of Christian people. The narrow-minded or the immature
will at all times necessarily consider such proceedings hypocrisy, but the outcome of his religious
and scientific conception of the world required the twofold language. Orthodox theology of
all creeds has never yet advanced beyond the circle first mapped out by his mind. She has suspected
and corrected her founder, she has thought she could lop off his heterodox opinions as if they
were accidental excrescences, she has incorporated with the simple faith itself the measure
of speculation she was obliged to admit, and continued to give the rule of faith a more philosophic
form, fragment by fragment, in order that she might thus be able to remove the gap between
Faith and Gnosis and to banish free theology through the formula of ecclesiastical dogma. But
it may reasonably be questioned whether all this is progress, and it is well worth investigating
whether the gap between half theological, clerical Christianity and a lay Christianity held
in tutelage is more endurable than that between Gnosis and Pistis, which Origen preserved and
bridged over.

The Christian system of Origen[682] is worked out in opposition to the systems of the Greek
philosophers and of the Christian Gnostics. It is moreover opposed to the ecclesiastical enemies
of science, the Christian Unitarians, and the Jews.[683] But the science of the faith, as developed
by Origen, being built up with the appliances of Philo's science, bears unmistakable marks
of Neoplatonism and Gnosticism. Origen speculated not only in the manner of Justin, but also
in that of Valentinus and therefore likewise after the fashion of Plotinus; in fact he is characterised
by the adoption of the methods and, in a certain sense, of the axioms current in the schools
of Valentinus and traceable in Neoplatonism. But, as this method implied the acknowledgment
of a sacred literature, Origen was an exegete who believed in the Holy Scriptures and indeed,
at bottom, he viewed all theology as a methodical exegesis of Holy Writ. Finally, however,
since Origen, as an ecclesiastical Christian, was convinced that the Church (by which he means
only the perfect and pure Church) is the sole possessor of God's holy revelations with whose
authority the faith may be justly satisfied, nothing but the two Testaments, as preserved by
her, was regarded by him as the absolutely reliable divine revelation.[684] But, in addition
to these, every possession of the Church, and, above all, the rule of faith, was authoritative
and holy.[685] By acknowledging not only the relative correctness of the beliefs held by the
great mass of simple Christians, as the Valentinians did, but also the indispensableness of
their faith as the foundation of speculation, Origen like Clement avoided the dilemma of becoming
a heterodox Gnostic or an ecclesiastical traditionalist. He was able to maintain this standpoint,
because in the first place his Gnosis required a guaranteed sacred literature which he only
found in the Church, and because in the second place this same Gnosis had extended its horizon
far enough to see that what the heretical Gnosis had regarded as contrasts were different aspects
of the same thing. The relative way of looking at things, an inheritance from the best time
of antiquity, is familiar to Origen, as it was to Clement; and he contrived never to lose sight
of it, in spite of the absolute attitude he had arrived at through the Christian Gnosis and
the Holy Scriptures. This relative view taught him and Clement toleration and discretion (Strom.
IV. 22. 139: [Greek: hê gnôsis agapa kai tous agnoountas didaskei te kai paideuei tên pasan
ktisin tou pantokratoros Theou timan], "Gnosis loves and instructs the ignorant and teaches
us to honour the whole creation of God Almighty"); and enabled them everywhere to discover,
hold fast, and further the good in that which was meagre and narrow, in that which was undeveloped
and as yet intrinsically obscure.[686] As an orthodox traditionalist and decided opponent of
all heresy Origen acknowledged that Christianity embraces a salvation which is offered to all
men and attained by faith, that it is the doctrine of historical facts to which we must adhere,
that the content of Christianity has been appropriately summarised by the Church in her rule
of faith,[687] and that belief is of itself sufficient for the renewal and salvation of man.
But, as an idealistic philosopher, Origen transformed the whole content of ecclesiastical faith
into ideas. Here he adhered to no fixed philosophical system, but, like Philo, Clement, and
the Neoplatonists, adopted and adapted all that had been effected by the labours of idealistic
Greek moralists since the time of Socrates. These, however, had long before transformed the
Socratic saying "know thyself" into manifold rules for the right conduct of life, and associated
with it a theosophy, in which man was first to attain to his true self.[688] These rules made
the true "sage" abstain from occupying himself in the service of daily life and "from burdensome
appearance in public". They asserted that the mind "can have no more peculiar duty than caring
for itself." This is accomplished by its not looking without nor occupying itself with foreign
things, but, turning inwardly to itself, restoring its own nature to itself and thus practising
righteousness.[689] Here it was taught that the wise man who no longer requires anything is
nearest the Deity, because he is a partaker of the highest good through possession of his rich
Ego and through his calm contemplation of the world; here moreover it was proclaimed that the
mind that has freed itself from the sensuous[690] and lives in constant contemplation of the
eternal is also in the end vouchsafed a view of the invisible and is itself deified. No one
can deny that this sort of flight from the world and possession of God involves a specific
secularisation of Christianity, and that the isolated and self-sufficient sage is pretty much
the opposite of the poor soul that hungers after righteousness.[691] Nor, on the other hand,
can any one deny that concrete examples of both types are found in infinite multiplicity and
might shade off into each other in this multiplicity. This was the case with Clement and Origen.
To them the ethical and religious ideal is the state without sorrow, the state of insensibility
to all evils, of order and peace--but peace in God. Reconciled to the course of the world,
trusting in the divine Logos,[692] rich in disinterested love to God and the brethren, reproducing
the divine thoughts, looking up with longing to heaven its native city,[693] the created spirit
attains its likeness to God and eternal bliss. It reaches this by the victory over sensuousness,
by constantly occupying itself with the divine--"Go ye believing thoughts into the wide field
of eternity"--by self-knowledge and contemplative isolation, which, however, does not exclude
work in the kingdom of God, that is in the Church. This is the divine wisdom: "The soul practises
viewing herself as in a mirror: she displays the divine Spirit in herself as in a mirror, if
she is to be found worthy of this fellowship; and she thus discovers the traces of a mysterious
way to deification."[694] Origen employed the Stoic and Platonic systems of ethics as an instrument
for the gradual realisation of this ideal.[695] With him the mystic and ecstatic as well as
the magic and sacramental element is still in the background, though it is not wanting. To
Origen's mind, however, the inadequacy of philosophical injunctions was constantly made plain
by the following considerations. (1) The philosophers, in spite of their noble thoughts of
God, tolerated the existence of polytheism; and this was really the only fault he had to find
with Plato. (2) The truth did not become universally accessible through them.[696] (3) As the
result of these facts they did not possess sufficient power.[697] In contrast to this the divine
revelation had already mastered a whole people through Moses--"Would to God the Jews had not
transgressed the law, and had not slain the prophets and Jesus; we would then have had a model
of that heavenly commonwealth which Plato has sought to describe"[698]--and the Logos shows
his universal power in the Church (1) by putting an end to all polytheism, and (2) by improving
everyone to the extent that his knowledge and capacity admit, and in proportion as his will
is inclined to, and susceptible of, that which is good.[699]

Not only, however, did Origen employ the Greek ethic in its varied types, but the Greek cosmological
speculation also formed the complicated substructure of his religious system of morals. The
Gnosis is formally a philosophy of revelation, that is a Scripture theology,[700] and materially
a cosmological speculation. On the basis of a detailed theory of inspiration, which itself,
moreover, originates with the philosophers, the Holy Scriptures are so treated that all facts
appear as the vehicles of ideas and only attain their highest value in this aspect. Systematic
theology, in undertaking its task, always starts, as Clement and Origen also did, with the
conscious or unconscious thought of emancipating itself from the outward revelation and community
of cultus that are the characteristic marks of positive religion. The place of these is taken
by the results of speculative cosmology, which, though themselves practically conditioned,
do not seem to be of this character. This also applies to Origen's Christian Gnosis or scientific
dogmatic, which is simply the metaphysics of the age. However, as he was the equal of the foremost
minds of his time, this dogmatic was no schoolboy imitation on his part, but was to some extent
independently developed and was worked out both in opposition to pantheistic Stoicism and to
theoretical dualism. That we are not mistaken in this opinion is shown by a document ranking
among the most valuable things preserved to us from the third century; we mean the judgment
passed on Origen by Porphyry in Euseb., H. E. VI. 19. Every sentence is instructive,[701] but
the culminating point is the judgment contained in § 7: [Greek: kata men ton Bion Christianôs
zôn kai paranomôs, kata de tas peri tôn pragmatôn kai tou theou doxas Hellênizôn kai ta Hellênôn
tois othneiois hupoballomenos mythois.] ("His outward life was that of a Christian and opposed
to the law, but in regard to his views of things and of the Deity, he thought like the Greeks,
inasmuch as he introduced their ideas into the myths of other peoples.") We can everywhere
verify this observation from Origen's works and particularly from the books written against
Celsus, where he is continually obliged to mask his essential agreement in principles and method
with the enemy of the Christians.[702] The Gnosis is in fact the Hellenic one and results in
that wonderful picture of the world which, though apparently a drama, is in reality immovable,
and only assumes such a complicated form here from its relation to the Holy Scriptures and
the history of Christ.[703] The Gnosis neutralises everything connected with empiric history;
and if this does not everywhere hold good with regard to the actual occurrence of facts, it
is at least invariably the case in respect to their significance. The clearest proof of this
is (1) that Origen raised the thought of the unchangeability of God to be the norm of his system
and (2) that he denied the historical, incarnate Logos any significance for "Gnostics." To
these Christ merely appears as the Logos who has been from eternity with the Father and has
always acted from the beginning. ([Greek: saphôs paristêsi tois noousi ta panta enôpion peri
autou tou huiou tou Theou, kai ta paristamena mustêria hupo tôn logôn autou, ta te pragmata,
ôn ainigmata êsan hai praxeis autou]).[705] No doubt the true theology based on revelation
makes pantheism appear overthrown as well as dualism, and here the influence of the two Testaments
cannot be mistaken; but a subtle form of the latter recurs in Origen's system, whilst the manner
in which he rejected both made the Greek philosophy of the age feel that there was something
akin to it here. In the final utterances of religious metaphysics ecclesiastical Christianity,
with the exception of a few compromises, is thrown off as a husk. The objects of religious
knowledge have no history or rather, and this is a genuinely Gnostic and Neoplatonic idea,
they have only a supramundane one.

This necessarily gave rise to the assumption of an esoteric and exoteric form of the Christian
religion, for it is only behind the statutory, positive religion of the Church that religion
itself is found. Origen gave the clearest expression to this assumption, which must have been
already familiar in the Alexandrian school of catechists, and convinced himself that it was
correct, because he saw that the mass of Christians were unable to grasp the deeper sense of
Scripture, and because he realised the difficulties of the exegesis. On the other hand, in
solving the problem of adapting the different points of his heterodox system of thought to
the regula fidei, he displayed the most masterly skill. He succeeded in finding an external
connection, because, though the construction of his theory proceeded from the top downwards,
he could find support for it on the steps of the regula fidei, already developed by Irenæus
into the history of salvation.[706] The system itself is to be, in principle and in every respect,
monistic, but, as the material world, though created by God out of nothing, merely appears
as a place of punishment and purification for souls, a strong element of dualism is inherent
in the system, as far as its practical application is concerned.[707] The prevailing contrast
is that between the one transcendent essence and the multiplicity of all created things. The
pervading ambiguity lies in the twofold view of the spiritual in so far as, on the one hand,
it belongs to God as the unfolding of his essence, and, on the other, as being created, is
contrasted with God. This ambiguity, which recurs in all the Neoplatonic systems and has continued
to characterise all mysticism down to the present day, originates in the attempt to repel Stoic
pantheism and yet to preserve the transcendental nature of the human spirit, and to maintain
the absolute causality of God without allowing his goodness to be called in question. The assumption
that created spirits can freely determine their own course is therefore a necessity of the
system; in fact this assumption is one of its main presuppositions[708] and is so boldly developed
as to limit the omnipotence and omniscience of God. But, as from the empirical point of view
the knot is tied for every man at the very moment he appears on earth, and since the problem
is not created by each human being as the result of his own independent will, but lies in his
organisation, speculation must retreat behind history. So the system, in accordance with certain
hints of Plato, is constructed on the same plan as that of Valentinus, for example, to which
it has an extraordinary affinity. It contains three parts: (1) The doctrine of God and his
unfoldings or creations, (2) the doctrine of the Fall and its consequences, (3) the doctrine
of redemption and restoration.[709] Like Denis, however, we may also, in accordance with a
premised theory of method, set forth the system in four sections, viz., Theology, Cosmology,
Anthropology, Teleology. Origen's fundamental idea is "the original indestructible unity of
God and all spiritual essence." From this it necessarily follows that the created spirit after
fall, error, and sin must ever return to its origin, to being in God. In this idea we have
the key to the religious philosophy of Origen.

The only sources for obtaining a knowledge of the truth are the Holy Scriptures of both Testaments.
No doubt the speculations of Greek philosophers also contain truths, but these have only a
propædeutic value and, moreover, have no certainty to offer, as have the Holy Scriptures, which
are a witness to themselves in the fulfilment of prophecy.[710] On the other hand Origen assumes
that there was an esoteric deeper knowledge in addition to the Holy Scriptures, and that Jesus
in particular imparted this deeper wisdom to a few;[711] but, as a correct Church theologian,
he scarcely made use of this assumption. The first methodical principle of his exegesis is
that the faith, as professed in the Church in contradistinction to heresy, must not be tampered
with.[712] But it is the carrying out of this rule that really forms the task of the theologian.
For the faith itself is fixed and requires no particular presentation; it never occurred to
Origen to assume that the fixing of the faith itself could present problems. It is complete,
clear, easily teachable, and really leads to victory over sensuality and sin (see c. Cels.
VII. 48 and cf. other passages), as well as to fellowship with God, since it rests on the revelation
of the Logos. But, as it remains determined by fear and hope of reward so, as "uninformed and
irrational faith" ([Greek: pistis idiôtikê] and [Greek: alogos]), it only leads to a "somatic
Christianity" ([Greek: Christianismos sômatikos]). It is the task of theology, however, to
decipher "spiritual Christianity" ([Greek: Christianismos pneumatikos]) from the Holy Scriptures,
and to elevate faith to knowledge and clear vision. This is effected by the method of Scripture
exegesis which ascertains the highest revelations of God.[713] The Scripture has a threefold
sense because, like the cosmos, alongside of which it stands like a second revelation, as it
were, it must contain a pneumatic, psychic, and somatic element. The somatic or historical
sense is in every case the first that must be ascertained. It corresponds to the stage of mere
faith and has consequently the same dignity as the latter. But there are instances where it
is to be given up and designated as a Jewish and fleshly sense. This is to be assumed in all
cases where it leads to ideas opposed to the nature of God, morality, the law of nature, or
reason.[714] Here one must judge (see above) that such objectionable passages were meant to
incite the searcher to a deeper investigation. The psychic sense is of a moral nature: in the
Old Testament more especially most narratives have a moral content, which one can easily find
by stripping off the history as a covering; and in certain passages one may content oneself
with this meaning. The pneumatic sense, which is the only meaning borne by many passages, an
assertion which neither Philo nor Clement ventured to make in plain terms, has with Origen
a negatively apologetic and a positively didactic aim. It leads to the ultimate ideas which,
once attained, are self-evident, and, so to speak, pass completely over into the mind of the
theologian, because they finally obtain for him clear vision and independent possession.[715]
When the Gnostic has attained this stage, he may throw away the ladders by which he has reached
this height.[716] He is then inwardly united with God's Logos, and from this union obtains
all that he requires. In most passages Origen presupposed the similarity and equal value of
all parts of the Holy Scriptures; but in some he showed that even inspiration has its stages
and grades, according to the receptivity and worthiness of each prophet, thus applying his
relative view of all matters of fact in such cases also. In Christ the full revelation of the
Logos was first expressed; his Apostles did not possess the same inspiration as he,[717] and
among the Apostles and apostolic men differences in the degrees of inspiration are again to
be assumed. Here Origen set the example of making a definite distinction between a heroic age
of the Apostles and the succeeding period. This laid the foundation for an assumption through
which the later Church down to our time has appeased her conscience and freed herself from
demands that she could not satisfy.[718]

THE DOCTRINE OF GOD AND HIS SELF-UNFOLDINGS OR CREATIONS.[719] The world points back to an
ultimate cause and the created spirit to an eternal, pure, absolutely simple, and unchangeable
spirit, who is the original source of all existence and goodness, so that everything that exists
only does so in virtue of being caused by that One, and is good in so far as it derives its
essence from the One who is perfection and goodness. This fundamental idea is the source of
all the conclusions drawn by Origen as to the essence, attributes, and knowableness of God.
As the One, God is contrasted with the Manifold; but the order in the Manifold points back
to the One. As the real Essence, God is opposed to the essences that appear and seem to vanish,
and that therefore have no real existence, because they have not their principle in themselves,
but testify: "We have not made ourselves." As the absolutely immaterial Spirit, God is contrasted
with the spirit that is clogged with matter, but which strives to get back to him from whom
it received its origin. The One is something different from the Manifold; but the order, the
dependence, and the longing of that which is created point back to the One, who can therefore
be known relatively from the Manifold. In sharpest contrast to the heretical Gnosis, Origen
maintained the absolute causality of God, and, in spite of all abstractions in determining
the essence of God, he attributed self-consciousness and will to this superessential Essence
(in opposition to Valentinus, Basilides, and the later Neoplatonists).[720] The created is
one thing and the Self-existent is another, but both are connected together; as the created
can only be understood from something self-existent, so the self-existent is not without analogy
to the created. The Self-existent is in itself a living thing; it is beyond dispute that Origen
with all his abstractions represented the Deity, whom he primarily conceived as a constant
substance, in a more living, and, so to speak, in a more personal way than the Greek philosophers.
Hence it was possible for him to produce a doctrine of the attributes of God. Here he did not
even shrink from applying his relative view to the Deity, because, as will be seen, he never
thinks of God without revelation, and because all revelation must be something limited. The
omnipresence of God indeed suffers from no limitation. God is potentially everywhere; but he
is everywhere only potentially; that is, he neither encompasses nor is encompassed. Nor is
he diffused through the universe, but, as he is removed from the limits of space, so also he
is removed from space itself.[721] But the omniscience and omnipotence of God have a limit,
which indeed, according to Origen, lies in the nature of the case itself. In the first place
his omnipotence is limited through his essence, for he can only do what he wills;[722] secondly
by logic, for omnipotence cannot produce things containing an inward contradiction: God can
do nothing contrary to nature, all miracles being natural in the highest sense[723]--thirdly,
by the impossibility of that which is in itself unlimited being comprehended, whence it follows
that the extent of everything created must be limited[724]--fourthly, by the impossibility
of realising an aim completely and without disturbing elements.[725] Omniscience has also its
corresponding limits; this is specially proved from the freedom of spirits bestowed by God
himself. God has indeed the capacity of foreknowledge, but he knows transactions beforehand
because they happen; they do not happen because he knows them.[726] That the divine purpose
should be realised in the end necessarily follows from the nature of the created spirit itself,
apart from the supporting activity of God. Like Irenæus and Tertullian Origen very carefully
discussed the attributes of goodness and justice in God in opposition to the Marcionites.[727]
But his exposition is different. In his eyes goodness and justice are not two opposite attributes,
which can and must exist in God side by side; but as virtues they are to him identical. God
rewards in justice and punishes in kindness. That it should go well with all, no matter how
they conduct themselves, would be no kindness; but it is kindness when God punishes to improve,
deter, and prevent. Passions, anger, and the like do not exist in God, nor any plurality of
virtues; but, as the Perfect One, he is all kindness. In other places, however, Origen did
not content himself with this presentation. In opposition to the Marcionites, who declared
Christ and the Father of Christ to be good, and the creator of the world to be just, he argued
that, on the contrary, God (the foundation of the world) is good, but that the Logos-Christ,
in so far as he is the pedagogus, is just.[728]

From the perfect goodness of God Origen infers that he reveals or communicates himself, from
his immutability that he always reveals himself. The eternal or never beginning communication
of perfection to other beings is a postulate of the concept "God". But, along with the whole
fraternity of those professing the same philosophy, Origen assumed that the One, in becoming
the Manifold and acting in the interests of the Manifold, can only effect his purpose by divesting
himself of absolute apathy and once more assuming a form in which he can act, that is, procuring
for himself an adequate organ--the Logos. The content of Origen's teaching about this Logos
was not essentially different from that of Philo and was therefore quite as contradictory;
only in his case everything is more sharply defined and the hypostasis of the Logos (in opposition
to the Monarchians) more clearly and precisely stated.[729] Nevertheless the personal independence
of the Logos is as yet by no means so sharply defined as in the case of the later Arians. He
is still the Consciousness of God, the spiritual Activity of God. Hence he is on the one hand
the idea of the world existing in God, and on the other the product of divine wisdom originating
with the will of God. The following are the most important propositions.[730] The Logos who
appeared in Christ, as is specially shown from Joh. I. 1 and Heb. I. 1, is the perfect image[731]
of God. He is the Wisdom of God, the reflection of his perfection and glory, the invisible
image of God. For that very reason there is nothing corporeal in him[732] and he is therefore
really God, not [Greek: autotheos], nor [Greek: ho Theos], nor [Greek: anarchos archê] ("beginningless
beginning"), but the second God.[733] But, as such, immutability is one of his attributes,
that is, he can never lose his divine essence, he can also in this respect neither increase
nor decrease (this immutability, however, is not an independent attribute, but he is perfect
as being an image of the Father's perfection).[734] Accordingly this deity is not a communicated
one in the sense of his having another independent essence in addition to this divine nature;
but deity rather constitutes his essence: [Greek: ho sotêr ou kata metousian, alla kat' ousian
esti Theos][735] ("the Saviour is not God by communication, but in his essence"). From this
it follows that he shares in the essence of God, therefore of the Father, and is accordingly
[Greek: homoousios] ("the same in substance with the Father") or, seeing that, as Son, he has
come forth from the Father, is engendered from the essence of the Father.[736] But having proceeded,
like the will, from the Spirit, he was always with God; there was not a time when he was not,[737]
nay, even this expression is still too weak. It would be an unworthy idea to think of God without
his wisdom or to assume a beginning of his begetting. Moreover, this begetting is not an act
that has only once taken place, but a process lasting from all eternity; the Son is always
being begotten of the Father.[738] It is the theology of Origen which Gregory Thaumaturgus
has thus summed up:[739] [Greek: eis kurios, monos ek monou, theos ek theou, charaktêr kai
eikôn tês theotêtos, logos energos, sophia tês tôn holôn sustaseôs periektikê kai dunamis tês
holês ktiseôs poiêtikê, huios alêthinos alêthinou patros, aoratos aoratou kai aphthartos aphthartou
kai athanatos athanatou kai aidios aidiou]. The begetting is an indescribable act which can
only be represented by inadequate images: it is no emanation--the expression [Greek: probolê]
is not found, so far as I know[740]--but is rather to be designated as an act of the will arising
from an inner necessity, an act which for that very reason is an emanation of the essence.
But the Logos thus produced is really a personally existing being; he is not an impersonal
force of the Father, though this still appears to be the case in some passages of Clement,
but he is the "sapientia dei substantialiter subsistens"[741] ("the wisdom of God substantially
existing") "figura expressa substantial patris" ("express image of the Father's substance"),
"virtus altera in sua proprietate subsistens" ("a second force existing in its own characteristic
fashion"). He is, and here Origen appeals to the old Acts of Paul, an "animal vivens" with
an independent existence.[742] He is another person,[743] namely, the second person in number.[744]
But here already begins Origen's second train of thought which limits the first that we have
set forth. As a particular hypostasis, which has its "first cause" ([Greek: prôton aition])
in God, the Son is "that which is caused" ([Greek: aitiaton]), moreover as the fulness of ideas,
as he who comprehends in himself all the forms that are to have an active existence, the Son
is no longer an absolute simplex like the Father.[745] He is already the first stage of the
transition from the One to the Manifold, and, as the medium of the world-idea, his essence
has an inward relation to the world, which is itself without beginning.[746] As soon therefore
as the category of causality is applied--which moreover dominates the system--and the particular
contemplation of the Son in relation to the Father gives way to the general contemplation of
his task and destination, the Son is not only called [Greek: ktisma] and [Greek: dêmiourgêma],
but all the utterances about the quality of his essence receive a limitation. We nowhere find
the express assertion that this quality is inferior or of a different kind when compared with
that of God; but these utterances lose their force when it is asserted that complete similarity
between Father and Son only exists in relation to the world. We have to acknowledge the divine
being that appeared in Christ to be the manifestation of the Deity; but, from God's standpoint,
the Son is the hypostasis appointed by and subordinated to him.[747] The Son stands between
the uncreated One and the created Many; in so far as unchangeableness is an attribute of self-existence
he does not possess it.[748] It is evident why Origen was obliged to conceive the Logos exactly
as he did; it was only in this form that the idea answered the purpose for which it was intended.
In the description of the essence of the Logos much more heed continues to be given to his
creative than to his redeeming significance. Since it was only a teacher that Origen ultimately
required for the purpose of redemption, he could unfold the nature and task of the Logos without
thinking of Christ, whose name indeed he frequently mentions in his disquisitions, but whose
person is really not of the slightest importance there.[749]

In order to comply with the rule of faith, and for this reason alone, for his speculation did
not require a Spirit in addition to the Logos, Origen also placed the Spirit alongside of Father
and Son. All that is predicated about him by the Church is that he is equal to the other persons
in honour and dignity, and it was he that inspired both Prophets and Apostles; but that it
is still undecided whether he be created or uncreated, and whether he too is to be considered
the Son of God or not.[750] As the third hypostasis, Origen reckoned him part of the constant
divine essence and so treated him after the analogy of the Son, without producing an impressive
proof of the necessity of this hypostasis. He, however, became the Holy Spirit through the
Son, and is related to the latter as the latter is related to the Father; in other words he
is subordinate to the Son; he is the first creation of the Father through the Son.[751] Here
Origen was following an old tradition. Considered quantitatively therefore, and this according
to Origen is the most important consideration, the Spirit's sphere of action is the smallest.
All being has its principle in the Father, the Son has his sphere in the rational, the Holy
Spirit in the sanctified, that is in the Church; this he has to rule over and perfect. Father,
Son, and Spirit form a [Greek: trias] ("triad")[752] to which nothing may be compared; they
are equal in dignity and honour, and the substance they possess is one. If the following is
not one of Rufinus' corrections, Origen said[753]: "Nihil in trinitate maius minusve dicendum
est cum unius divinitatis fons verbo ac ratione sua teneat universa"[754] ("nothing in the
Trinity is to be called greater or less, since the fountain of one divinity holds all his parts
by word and reason"). But, as in Origen's sense the union of these only exists because the
Father alone is the "source of deity" ([Greek: pêgê tês theotêtos]) and principle of the other
two hypostases, the Trinity is in truth no homogeneous one, but one which, in accordance with
a "subtle emanation idea", has degrees within it. This Trinity, which in the strict sense remains
a Trinity of revelation, except that revelation belongs to the essence of God, is with Origen
the real secret of the faith, the mystery beyond all mysteries. To deny it shows a Jewish,
carnal feeling or at least the greatest narrowness of conception.

The idea of createdness was already more closely associated with the Holy Ghost than with the
Logos. He is in a still clearer fashion than the Son himself the transition to the series of
ideas and spirits that having been created by the Son, are in truth the unfolding of his fulness.
They form the next stage after the Holy Spirit. In assuming the existence of such beings as
were required by his philosophical system, Origen appealed to the Biblical doctrine of angels,
which he says is expressly acknowledged in the Church.[755] With Clement even the association
of the Son and Holy Ghost with the great angelic spirits is as yet not altogether avoided,
at least in his expressions.[756] Origen was more cautious in this respect.[757] The world
of spirits appears to him as a series of well-arranged, graded energies, as the representative
of created reason. Its characteristic is growth, that is, progress ([Greek: prokopê]).[758]
Growth is conditioned by freedom: "omnis creatura rationabilis laudis et culpæ capax: laudis,
si secundum rationem, quam in se habet, ad meliora proficiat, culpæ, si rationem recti declinet"[759]
("every rational creature is capable of meriting praise or blame--praise, if it advance to
better things according to the reason it possesses in itself, blame, if it avoid the right
course"). As unchangeableness and permanence are characteristic of the Deity, so freedom is
the mark of the created spirit.[760] In this thesis Origen goes beyond the assumption of the
heretical Gnostics just as much as he does in his other proposition that the creaturely spirit
is in no sense a portion of the divine (because it is changeable[761]); but in reality freedom,
as he understands it, is only the capacity of created spirits to determine their own destiny
for a time. In the end, however, they must turn to that which is good, because everything spiritual
is indestructible. Sub specie æternitatis, then, the mere communication of the divine element
to the created spirit[762] is not a mere communication, and freedom is no freedom; but the
absolute necessity of the created spirit's developing itself merely appears as freedom. Yet
Origen himself did not draw this conclusion, but rather based everything on his conception
that the freedom of naturæ rationabiles consisted in the possibilitas utriusque, and sought
to understand the cosmos, as it is, from this freedom. To the naturæ rationabiles, which have
different species and ordines, human souls also belong. The whole of them were created from
all eternity; for God would not be almighty unless he had always produced everything[763];
in virtue of their origin they are equal, for their original community with the Logos permits
of no diversity[764]; but, on the other hand, they have received different tasks and their
development is consequently different. In so far as they are spirits subject to change, they
are burdened with a kind of bodily nature,[765] for it is only the Deity that is without a
body. The element of materiality is a necessary result of their finite nature, that is, of
their being created; and this applies both to angels and human souls.[766] Now Origen did not
speculate at all as to how the spirit world might have developed in ideal fashion, a fact which
it is exceedingly important to recognise; he knows nothing at all about an ideal development
for all, and does not even view it as a possibility. The truth rather is that as soon as he
mentions the naturæ rationabiles, he immediately proceeds to speak of their fall, their growth,
and their diversities. He merely contemplates them in the given circumstances in which they
are placed (see the exposition in [Greek: peri archôn] II. 9. 2).

THE DOCTRINE OF THE FALL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. All created spirits must develop. When they
have done so, they attain perfection and make way for new dispensations and worlds.[767] In
the exercise of their freedom, however, disobedience, laxity, laziness, and failure make their
appearance among them in an endless multiplicity of ways.[768] The disciplining and purifying
of these spirits was the purpose for which the material world was created by God.[769] It is
therefore a place of purification, ruled and harmoniously arranged by God's wisdom.[770] Each
member of the world of spirits has received a different kind of material nature in proportion
to his degree of removal from the Creator. The highest spirits, who have virtually held fast
by that which is good, though they too stand in need of restitution, guide the world, are servants
of God ([Greek: angeloi]), and have bodies of an exceedingly subtle kind in the form of a globe
(stars). The spirits that have fallen very deeply (the spirits of men) are banished into material
bodies. Those that have altogether turned against God have received very dark bodies, indescribably
ugly, though not visible. Men therefore are placed between the angels and demons, both of whom
try to influence them. The moral struggle that man has to undergo within himself is made harder
by the demons, but lightened by the angels,[771] for these spiritual powers are at all times
and places acting both upon the physical and the spiritual world. But everything is subject
to the permission of the divine goodness and finally also to the guidance of divine providence,
though the latter has created for itself a limit in freedom.[772] Evil, however, and it is
in this idea that Origen's great optimism consists, cannot conquer in the end. As it is nothing
eternal, so also it is at bottom nothing real; it is "nonexistent" ([Greek: ouch on]) and "unreal"
([Greek: anupostaton]).[773] For this very reason the estrangement of the spirits from God
must finally cease; even the devil, who, as far as his being is concerned, resulted from God's
will, cannot always remain a devil. The spirits must return to God, and this moment is also
the end of the material world, which is merely an intermediate phase.[774]

According to this conception the doctrine of man, who in Origen's view is no longer the sole
aim of creation to the same extent as he is with the other Fathers,[775] assumes the following
form: The essence of man is formed by the reasonable soul, which has fallen from the world
above. This is united with the body by means of the animal soul. Origen thus believes in a
threefold nature of man. He does so in the first place, because Plato holds this theory, and
Origen always embraced the most complicated view in matters of tradition, and secondly, because
the rational soul can never in itself be the principle of action opposed to God, and yet something
relatively spiritual must be cited as the cause of this action. It is true that we also find
in Origen the view that the spirit in man has itself been cooled down into a soul, has been,
as it were, transformed into a soul; but there is necessarily an ambiguity here, because on
the one hand the spirit of man is said to have chosen a course opposed to God, and, on the
other, that which is rational and free in man must be shown to be something remaining intact.[776]
Man's struggle consists in the endeavour of the two factors forming his constitution to gain
control of his sphere of action. If man conquers in this struggle he attains likeness to God;
the image of God he bears beyond danger of loss in his indestructible, rational, and therefore
immortal spirit.[777] Victory, however, denotes nothing else than the subjugation of the instincts
and passions.[778] No doubt God affords help in the struggle, for nothing good is without God,[779]
but in such a way as not to interfere with freedom. According to this conception sin is a matter
of necessity in the case of fallen spirits; all men are met with as sinners and are so, for
they were already sinners.[780] Sin is rooted in the whole earthly condition of men; it is
the weakness and error of the spirit parted from its origin.[781] The idea of freedom, indeed,
is supposed to be a feature which always preserves the guilty character of sin; but in truth
it becomes a mere appearance,[782] it does not avail against the constitution of man and the
sinful habit propagated in human society.[783] All must be sinners at first,[784] for that
is as much their destiny as is the doom of death which is a necessary consequence of man's
material nature.[785]

The Doctrine of Redemption and Restoration.

In the view of Clement and Origen the proposition: "God wishes us to be saved by means of ourselves"
([Greek: o Theos hêmas ex hêmôn autôn bouletai sôzesthai]) is quite as true as the other statement
that no spirit can be saved without entering into fellowship with the Logos and submitting
to his instruction.[786] They moreover hold that the Logos, after passing through his various
stages of revealing activity (law of nature, Mosaic law), disclosed himself in the Gospel in
a manner complete and accessible to all, so that this revelation imparts redemption and eternal
happiness to all men, however different their capacities may be. Finally, it is assumed that
not only men but all spiritual creatures, from the radiant spirits of heaven down to the dusky
demons, have the capacity and need of redemption; while for the highest stage, the "spiritual
Church", there is an eternal Gospel which is related to the written one as the latter is to
the law. This eternal Gospel is the first complete revelation of God's highest intentions,
and lies hidden in the Holy Scriptures.[787] These elements compose Origen's doctrine of revelation
in general and of Christ in particular.[788] They presuppose the sighing of the creature and
the great struggle which is more especially carried on upon earth, within the human breast,
by the angels and demons, virtues and vices, knowledge and passion, that dispute the possession
of man. Man must conquer and yet he cannot do so without help. But help has never been wanting.
The Logos has been revealing himself from the beginning. Origen's teaching concerning the preparatory
history of redemption is founded on the doctrines of the Apologists; but with him everything
takes a more vivid form, and influences on the part of the heretical Gnosis are also not lacking.
Pure spirits, whom no fault of their own had caused to be invested with bodies, namely, the
prophets, were sent to men by the Logos in order to support the struggling and to increase
knowledge. To prepare the way of salvation the Logos chose for himself a whole people, and
he revealed himself among all men. But all these undertakings did not yet lead to the goal.
The Logos himself was obliged to appear and lead men back. But by reason of the diverse nature
of the spirits, and especially of men, the redeeming work of the Logos that appeared could
not fail to be a complicated one. In the case of some he had really to show them the victory
over the demons and sin, a view which beyond dispute is derived from that of Valentinus. He
had, as the "Godman," to make a sacrifice which represented the expiation of sin, he had to
pay a ransom which put an end to the devil's sovereignty over men's souls, and in short he
had to bring a redemption visible and intelligible to all.[789] To the rest, however, as divine
teacher and hierophant he had to reveal the depths of knowledge, and to impart in this very
process a new principle of life, so that they might now partake of his life and themselves
become divine through being interwoven with the divine essence. Here, as in the former case,
restoration to fellowship with God is the goal; but, as in the lower stage, this restoration
is effected through faith and sure conviction of the reality of a historical fact--namely,
the redeeming death of Christ,--so, in the higher stage, it is accomplished through knowledge
and love, which, soaring upward beyond the Crucified One, grasp the eternal essence of the
Logos, revealed to us through his teaching in the eternal Gospel.[790] What the Gnostics merely
represented as a more or less valuable appearance-- namely, the historical work of Christ--was
to Origen no appearance but truth. But he did not view it as the truth, and in this he agrees
with the Gnostics, but as a truth, beyond which lies a higher. That historical work of Christ
was a reality; it is also indispensable for men of more limited endowments, and not a matter
of indifference to the perfect; but the latter no longer require it for their personal life.
Here also Origen again contrived to reconcile contradictions and thus acknowledged, outdid,
reconciled, and united both the theses of the Gnostics and those of orthodox Christians. The
object and goal of redemption are the same for all, namely, the restoration of the created
spirit to God and participation in the divine life. In so far as history is a struggle between
spirits and demons, the death of Christ on the cross is the turning-point of history, and its
effects extend even into heaven and hell.[791]

On the basis of this conception of redemption Origen developed his idea of Christ. Inasmuch
as he recognised Christ as the Redeemer, this Christ, the God-man, could not but be as many-sided
as redemption is. Only through that masterly art of reconciling contradictions, and by the
aid of that fantastic idea which conceives one real being as dwelling in another, could there
be any apparent success in the attempt to depict a homogeneous person who in truth is no longer
a person, but the symbol of the various redemptions. That such an acute thinker, however, did
not shrink from the monstrosity his speculation produced is ultimately to be accounted for
by the fact that this very speculation afforded him the means of nullifying all the utterances
about Christ and falling back on the idea of the divine teacher as being the highest one. The
whole "humanity" of the Redeemer together with its history finally disappears from the eyes
of the perfect one. What remains is the principle, the divine Reason, which became known and
recognisable through Christ. The perfect one, and this remark also applies to Clement's perfect
Gnostic, thus knows no "Christology", but only an indwelling of the Logos in Jesus Christ,
with which the indwellings of this same Logos in men began. To the Gnostic the question of
the divinity of Christ is of as little importance as that of the humanity. The former is no
question, because speculation, starting above and proceeding downwards, is already acquainted
with the Logos and knows that he has become completely comprehensible in Christ; the latter
is no question, because the humanity is a matter of indifference, being the form in which the
Logos made himself recognisable. But to the Christian who is not yet perfect the divinity as
well as the humanity of Christ is a problem, and it is the duty of the perfect one to solve
and explain it, and to guard this solution against errors on all sides. To Origen, however,
the errors are already Gnostic Docetism on the one hand, and the "Ebionite" view on the other.[792]
His doctrine was accordingly as follows: As a pure unchangeable spirit, the Logos could not
unite with matter, because this as [Greek: mê on] would have depotentiated him. A medium was
required. The Logos did not unite with the body, but with a soul, and only through the soul
with the body. This soul was a pure one; it was a created spirit that had never fallen from
God, but always remained in faithful obedience to him, and that had chosen to become a soul
in order to serve the purposes of redemption. This soul then was always devoted to the Logos
from the first and had never renounced fellowship with him. It was selected by the Logos for
the purpose of incarnation and that because of its moral dignity. The Logos became united with
it in the closest way; but this connection, though it is to be viewed as a mysteriously real
union, continues to remain perfect only because of the unceasing effort of will by which the
soul clings to the Logos. Thus, then, no intermixture has taken place. On the contrary the
Logos preserves his impassibility, and it is only the soul that hungers and thirsts, struggles
and suffers. In this, too, it appears as a real human soul, and in the same way the body is
sinless and unpolluted, as being derived from a virgin; but yet it is a human one. This humanity
of the body, however, does not exclude its capacity of assuming all possible qualities the
Logos wishes to give it; for matter of itself possesses no qualities. The Logos was able at
any moment to give his body the form it required, in order to make the proper impression on
the various sorts of men. Moreover, he was not enclosed in the soul and body of Christ; on
the contrary he acted everywhere as before and united himself, as formerly, with all the souls
that opened themselves to him. But with none did the union become so close as with the soul,
and consequently also with the body of Jesus. During his earthly life the Logos glorified and
deified his soul by degrees and the latter acted in the same way on his body. Origen contrived
to arrange the different functions and predicates of the incarnate Logos in such a way that
they formed a series of stages which the believer becomes successively acquainted with as he
advances in knowledge. But everything is most closely united together in Christ. This union
([Greek: koinônia enôsis, anakrasis]) was so intimate that Holy Writ has named the created
man, Jesus, the Son of God; and on the other hand has called the Son of God the Son of Man.
After the resurrection and ascension the whole man Jesus appears transformed into a spirit,
is completely received into the Godhead, and is thus identical with the Logos.[793] In this
conception one may be tempted to point out all possible "heresies":--the conception of Jesus
as a heavenly man--but all men are heavenly;--the Adoptianist ("Ebionite") Christology--but
the Logos as a person stands behind it;--the conception of two Logoi, a personal and an impersonal;
the Gnostic separation of Jesus and Christ; and Docetism. As a matter of fact Origen united
all these ideas, but modified the whole of them in such a way that they no longer seem, and
to some extent are not, what they turn out to be when subjected to the slightest logical analysis.
This structure is so constituted that not a stone of it admits of being a hair's-breadth broader
or narrower. There is only one conception that has been absolutely unemployed by Origen, that
is, the modalistic view. Origen is the great opponent of Sabellianism, a theory which in its
simplicity frequently elicited from him words of pity; otherwise he made use of all the ideas
about Christ that had been formed in the course of two hundred years. This becomes more and
more manifest the more we penetrate into the details of this Christology. We cannot, however,
attribute to Origen a doctrine of two natures, but rather the notion of two subjects that become
gradually amalgamated with each other, although the expression "two natures" is not quite foreign
to Origen.[794] The Logos retains his human nature eternally,[795] but only in the same sense
in which we preserve our nature after the resurrection.

The significance which this Christological attempt possessed for its time consists first in
its complexity, secondly in the energetic endeavour to give an adequate conception of Christ's
humanity, that is, of the moral freedom pertaining to him as a creature. This effort was indeed
obliged to content itself with a meagre result: but we are only justified in measuring Origen's
Christology by that of the Valentinians and Basilidians, that is, by the scientific one that
had preceded it. The most important advance lies in the fact that Origen set forth a scientific
Christology in which he was able to find so much scope for the humanity of Christ. Whilst within
the framework of the scientific Christologies this humanity had hitherto been conceived as
something indifferent or merely apparent, Origen made the first attempt to incorporate it with
the various speculations without prejudice to the Logos, God in nature and person. No Greek
philosopher probably heeded what Irenæus set forth respecting Christ as the second Adam, the
recapitulatur generis humani; whereas Origen's speculation could not be overlooked. In this
case the Gnosis really adopted the idea of the incarnation, and at the same time tried to demonstrate
the conception of the God-man from the notions of unity of will and love. In the treatise against
Celsus, moreover, Origen went the reverse way to work and undertook to show, and this not merely
by help of the proof from prophecy, that the predicate deity applied to the historical Christ.[796]
But Origen's conception of Christ's person as a model (for the Gnostic) and his repudiation
of all magical theories of redemption ultimately explain why he did not, like Tertullian, set
forth a doctrine of two natures, but sought to show that in Christ's case a human subject with
his will and feelings became completely merged in the Deity. No doubt he can say that the union
of the divine and human natures had its beginning in Christ, but here he virtually means that
this beginning is continued in the sense of souls imitating the example of Christ. What is
called the real redemption supposed to be given in him is certainly mediated in the Psychic
through his work, but the person of Christ which cannot be known to any but the perfect man
is by no means identified with that real redemption, but appears as a free moral personality,
inwardly blended with the Deity, a personality which cannot mechanically transfer the content
of its essence, though it can indeed exercise the strongest impression on mind and heart. To
Origen the highest value of Christ's person lies in the fact that the Deity has here condescended
to reveal to us the whole fulness of his essence, in the person of a man, as well as in the
fact that a man is given to us who shows that the human spirit is capable of becoming entirely
God's. At bottom there is nothing obscure and mystical here; the whole process takes place
in the will and in the feelings through knowledge.[797]

This is sufficient to settle the nature of what is called personal attainment of salvation.
Freedom precedes and supporting grace follows. As in Christ's case his human soul gradually
united itself with the Logos in proportion as it voluntarily subjected its will to God, so
also every man receives grace according to his progress. Though Clement and Origen did not
yet recommend actual exercises according to definite rules, their description of the gradations
by which the soul rises to God already resembles that of the Neoplatonists, except that they
decidedly begin with faith as the first stage. Faith is the first step and is our own work.[798]
Then follows the religious contemplation of visible things, and from this the soul advances,
as on the steps of a ladder, to the contemplation of the substantiæ rationabiles, the Logos,
the knowable essence of God, and the whole fulness of the Deity.[799] She retraces her steps
upwards along the path she formerly passed over as a fallen spirit. But, when left to her own
resources, she herself is everywhere weak and powerless; she requires at every stage the divine
grace, that is, enlightenment.[800] Thus a union of grace and freedom takes place within the
sphere of the latter, till the "contemplative life" is reached, that joyous ascetic contemplativeness,
in which the Logos is the friend, associate, and bridegroom of the soul, which now, having
become a pure spirit, and being herself deified, clings in love to the Deity.[801] In this
view the thought of regeneration in the sense of a fundamental renewal of the Ego has no place;[802]
still baptism is designated the bath of regeneration. Moreover, in connection with the consideration
of main Biblical thoughts (God as love, God as the Father, Regeneration, Adoption, etc.) we
find in both Clement and Origen passages which, free from the trammels of the system, reproduce
and set forth the preaching of the Gospel in a surprisingly appropriate way.[803] It is evident
that in Origen's view there can be no visible means of grace; but it likewise follows from
his whole way of thinking that the symbols attending the enlightening operation of grace are
not a matter of indifference to the Christian Gnostic, whilst to the common man they are indispensable.[804]
In the same way he brought into play the system of numerous mediators and intercessors with
God, viz., angels and dead and living saints, and counselled an appeal to them. In this respect
he preserved a heathen custom. Moreover, Origen regards Christ as playing an important part
in prayer, particularly as mediator and high priest. On prayer to Christ he expressed himself
with great reserve.

Origen's eschatology occupies a middle position between that of Irenæus and the theory of the
Valentinian Gnostics, but is more akin to the latter view. Whilst, according to Irenæus, Christ
reunites and glorifies all that had been severed, though in such a way that there is still
a remnant eternally damned; and, according to Valentinus, Christ separates what is illegitimately
united and saves the spirits alone, Origen believes that all spirits will be finally rescued
and glorified, each in the form of its individual life, in order to serve a new epoch of the
world when sensuous matter disappears of itself. Here he rejects all sensuous eschatological
expectations.[805] He accepted the formula, "resurrection of the flesh", only because it was
contained in the doctrine of the Church; but, on the strength of 1 Cor. XV. 44, he interpreted
it as the rising of a "corpus spiritale", which will lack all material attributes and even
all the members that have sensuous functions, and which will beam with radiant light like the
angels and stars.[806] Rejecting the doctrine that souls sleep,[807] Origen assumed that the
souls of the departed immediately enter Paradise,[808] and that souls not yet purified pass
into a state of punishment, a penal fire, which, however, like the whole world, is to be conceived
as a place of purification.[809] In this way also Origen contrived to reconcile his position
with the Church doctrines of the judgment and the punishments in hell; but, like Clement, he
viewed the purifying fire as a temporary and figurative one; it consists in the torments of
conscience.[810] In the end all the spirits in heaven and earth, nay, even the demons, are
purified and brought back to God by the Logos-Christ,[811] after they have ascended from stage
to stage through seven heavens.[812] Hence Origen treated this doctrine as an esoteric one:
"for the common man it is sufficient to know that the sinner is punished."[813]

This system overthrew those of the Gnostics, attracted Greek philosophers, and justified ecclesiastical
Christianity. If one undertook to subject it to a new process of sublimation from the standpoint
given in the "contemplative life", little else would be left than the unchangeable spirit,
the created spirit, and the ethic. But no one is justified in subjecting it to this process.[814]
The method according to which Origen preserved whatever appeared valuable in the content of
tradition is no less significant than his system of ethics and the great principle of viewing
everything created in a relative sense. Supposing minds of a radical cast, to have existed
at the close of the history of ancient civilisation, what would have been left to us? The fact
of a strong and undivided religious interest attaching itself to the traditions of the philosophers
and of the two Testaments was the condition--to use Origen's own language--that enabled a new
world of spirits to arise after the old one had finished its course.

During the following century Origen's theology at first acted in its entirety. But it likewise
attained this position of influence, because some important propositions could be detached
from their original connection and fitted into a new one. It is one of the peculiarities of
this ecclesiastical philosophy of religion that the most of its formulæ could be interpreted
and employed in utramque partem. The several propositions could be made to serve very different
purposes not only by being halved, but also by being grouped. With this the relative unity
that distinguishes the system no doubt vanished; but how many are there who strive after unity
and completeness in their theory of the world? Above all, however, there was something else
that necessarily vanished, as soon as people meddled with the individual propositions, and
enlarged or abridged them. We mean the frame of mind which produced them, that wonderful unity
between the relative view of things and the absolute estimate of the highest good attainable
by the free spirit that is certain of its God. But a time came, nay, had already come, when
a sense of proportion and relation was no longer to be found.

In the East the history of dogma and of the Church during the succeeding centuries is the history
of Origen's philosophy. Arians and orthodox, critics and mystics, priests who overcame the
world and monks who shunned it but were eager for knowledge[815] could appeal to this system
and did not fail to do so. But, in the main problem that Origen set for the Church in this
religious philosophy of his, we find a recurrence of that propounded by the so-called Gnosticism
two generations earlier. He solved it by producing a system which reconciled the faith of the
Church with Greek philosophy; and he dealt Gnosticism its death-blow. This solution, however,
was by no means intended as the doctrine of the Church, since indeed it was rather based on
the distinction between Church belief and theology, and consequently on the distinction between
the common man and the theologian. But such a distinction was not permanently tenable in a
Church that had to preserve its strength by the unity and finality of a revealed faith, and
no longer tolerated fresh changes in the interpretation of its possession. Hence a further
compromise was necessary. The Greek philosophy, or speculation, did not attain real and permanent
recognition within the Church till a new accommodation, capable of being accounted both Pistis
and Gnosis, was found between what Origen looked on as Church belief and what he regarded as
Gnosis. In the endeavours of Irenæus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus were already found hesitating,
nay, we may almost say naïve, attempts at such an accommodation; but ecclesiastical traditionalism
was unable to attain complete clearness as to its own position till it was confronted with
a philosophy of religion that was no longer heathen or Gnostic, but had an ecclesiastical colouring.

But, with this prospect, we have already crossed the border of the third century. At its beginning
there were but few theologians in Christendom who were acquainted with speculation, even in
its fragmentary form. In the course of the century it became a recognised part of the orthodox
faith, in so far as the Logos doctrine triumphed in the Church. This development is the most
important that took place in the third century; for it denoted the definite transformation
of the rule of faith into the compendium of a Greek philosophical system, and it is the parallel
of a contemporaneous transformation of the Church into a holy commonwealth (see above, chapter 3).

[Footnote 661: Overbeck, l.c., p. 455, has very rightly remarked: "The origin of the Alexandrian
school of catechists is not a portion of the Church history of the 2nd century, that has somehow
been left in the dark by a mere accident; but a part of the well-defined dark region on the
map of the ecclesiastical historian of this period, which contains the beginnings of all the
fundamental institutions of the Church as well as those of the Alexandrian school of catechists,
a school which was the first attempt to formulate the relationship of Christianity to secular
science." We are, moreover, still in a state of complete uncertainty as to the personality
and teaching of Pantænus (with regard to him see Zahn, "Forschungen" Vol. III., pp. 64 ff.
77 ff). We can form an idea of the school of catechists from the 6th Book of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical
History and from the works of Clement and Origen.]

with Edessa. He mentions Clement in his chronicles. On the connection of Alexander and the

The best estimate of the great tripartite work (Protrepticus, Pædagogus, Stromateis) is found
in Overbeck, l.c. The titles of Clement's remaining works, which are lost to us or only preserved
in fragments, show how comprehensive his scientific labours were.]

[Footnote 665: This applies quite as much to the old principles of Christian morality as to
the traditional faith. With respect to the first we may refer to the treatise: "Quis dives

[Footnote 666: Clement was also conscious of the novelty of his undertaking; see Overbeck,
l.c., p. 464 f. The respect enjoyed by Clement as a master is shown by the letters of Alexander
of Jerusalem. See Euseb., H. E. VI. 11 and specially VI. 14. Here both Pantænus and Clement
are called "Father", but whilst the former receives the title, [Greek: ho makarios hôs alêthôs
kai kurios ], the latter is called: [Greek: ho hieros Klêmês, kurios mou genomenos kai ôphelêsas

[Footnote 667: Strom. VI. 14, 109: [Greek: pleon estin tou pisteusai to gnônai], Pistis is

teleiôsis anthrôpou] (l.c.), [Greek: pistis epistêmonikê] (II. II. 48).]

[Footnote 668: We have here more particularly to consider those paragraphs of the Stromateis
where Clement describes the perfect Gnostic: the latter elevates himself by dispassionate love
to God, is raised above everything earthly, has rid himself of ignorance, the root of all evil,
and already lives a life like that of the angels. See Strom. VI. 9. 71, 72: [Greek: Oude gar

[Footnote 669: Philo is quoted by Clement several times and still more frequently made use
of without acknowledgment. See the copious citations in Siegfried, Philo von Alexandrien, pp.
343-351. In addition to this Clement made use of many Greek philosophers or quoted them without
acknowledgment, e.g., Musonius.]

[Footnote 670: Like Philo and Justin, Clement also no doubt at times asserts that the Greek
philosophers pilfered from the Old Testament; but see Strom. I. 5. 28 sq.: [Greek: pantôn men

[Footnote 671: See Bratke's instructive treatise cited above.]

[Footnote 672: The fact that Clement appeals in support of the Gnosis to an esoteric tradition
(Strom. VI. 7. 61: VI. 8. 68: VII. 10. 55) proves how much this writer, belonging as he did
to a sceptical age, underestimated the efficacy of all human thought in determining the ultimate
truth of things. The existence of sacred writings containing all truth was not even enough
for him; the content of these writings had also to be guaranteed by divine communication. But
no doubt the ultimate cause of this, as of all similar cases of scepticism, was the dim perception
that ethics and religion do not at all come within the sphere of the intellectual, and that
the intellect can produce nothing of religious value. As, however, in consequence of philosophical
tradition, neither Philo, nor the Gnostics, nor Clement, nor the Neoplatonists were able to
shake themselves free from the intellectual scheme, those things which--as they instinctively
felt, but did not recognise--could really not be ascertained by knowledge at all received from
them the name of suprarational and were traced to divine revelation. We may say that the extinction
or pernicious extravagancies to which Greek philosophy was subjected in Neoplatonism, and the
absurdities into which the Christian dogmatic was led, arose from the fact that the tradition
of placing the ethical and religious feelings and the development of character within the sphere
of knowledge, as had been the case for nearly a thousand years, could not be got rid of, though
the incongruity was no doubt felt. Contempt for empiricism, scepticism, the extravagancies
of religious metaphysics which finally become mythology, have their origin here. Knowledge
still continues to be viewed as the highest possession; it is, however, no longer knowledge,
but character and feeling; and it must be nourished by the fancy in order to be able to assert
itself as knowledge.]

[Footnote 673: Clement was not a Neoplatonic mystic in the strict sense of the word. When he
describes the highest ethical ideal, ecstasy is wanting; and the freshness with which he describes
Quietism shows that he himself was no Quietist. See on this point Bigg's third lecture, l.c.,
particularly p. 98 f. "... The silent prayer of the Quietist is in fact ecstasy, of which there
is not a trace in Clement. For Clement shrank from his own conclusions. Though the father of
all the Mystics he is no Mystic himself. He did not enter the 'enchanted garden,' which he
opened for others. If he talks of 'flaying the sacrifice,' of leaving sense behind, of Epopteia,
this is but the parlance of his school. The instrument to which he looks for growth in knowledge
is not trance, but disciplined reason. Hence Gnosis, when once obtained, is indefectible, not
like the rapture which Plotinus enjoyed but four times during his acquaintance with Porphyry,
which in the experience of Theresa never lasted more than half an hour. The Gnostic is no Visionary,
no Theurgist, no Antinomian."]

[Footnote 674: What a bold and joyous thinker Clement was is shown by the almost audacious
remark in Strom. IV. 22. 136: [Greek: ei goun tis kath' hypothesin protheiê tô gnôstikô poteron

[Footnote 675: Strom. VII. 1. 1. In several passages of his main work Clement refers to those
churchmen who viewed the practical and speculative concentration of Church tradition as dangerous
and questioned the use of philosophy at all. See Strom. VI. 10. 80: [Greek: polloi kathaper
hoi paides ta mormolukeia, houtôs dediasi tên hellênikên philosophian, phoboumenoi mê apagagê
autous]. VI. 11. 93.]

[Footnote 676: Eusebius, H. E. VI. 14. 8, tells us that Origen was a disciple of Clement.]

[Footnote 677: Clement's authority in the Church continued much longer than that of Origen.
See Zahn, "Forschungen" III. p. 140 f. The heterodox opinions advanced by Clement in the Hypotyposes
are for the most part only known to us in an exaggerated form from the report of Photius.]

[Footnote 678: In ecclesiastical antiquity all systematising was merely relative and limited,
because the complex of sacred writings enjoyed a different authority from that which it possessed
in the following period. Here the reference of a theologoumenon to a passage of Scripture was
of itself sufficient, and the manifold and incongruous doctrines were felt as a unity in so
far as they could all be verified from Holy Scriptures. Thus the fact that the Holy Scriptures
were regarded as a series of divine oracles guaranteed, as it were, a transcendental unity
of the doctrines, and, in certain circumstances, relieved the framer of the system of a great
part of his task. Hitherto little justice has been done to this view of the history of dogma,
though it is the only solution of a series of otherwise insoluble problems. We cannot for example
understand the theology of Augustine, and necessarily create for ourselves the most difficult
problems by our own fault, if we make no use of that theory. In Origen's dogmatic and that
of subsequent Church Fathers--so far as we can speak of a dogmatic in their case--the unity
lies partly in the canon of Holy Scripture and partly in the ultimate aim; but these two principles
interfere with each other. As far as the Stromateis of Clement is concerned, Overbeek (l.c.)
has furnished the explanation of its striking plan. Moreover, how would it have been conceivable
that the riches of Holy Scripture, as presented to the philosophers who allegorised the books,
could have been mastered, problems and all, at the first attempt.]

[Footnote 681: In the polemic against Celsus it seems to us in not a few passages as if the
feeling for truth had forsaken him. If we consider, however, that in Origen's idea the premises
of his speculation were unassailable, and if we further consider into what straits he was driven
by Celsus, we will conclude that no proof has been advanced of Origen's having sinned against
the current rules of truth. These, however, did not include the commandment to use in disputation
only such arguments as could be employed in a positive doctrinal presentation. Basilius (Ep.
210 ad prim. Neocæs) was quite ready to excuse an utterance of Gregory Thaumaturgus, that sounded
suspiciously like Sabellianism, by saying that the latter was not speaking [Greek: dogmatikôs],
but [Greek: agônistikôs]. Jerome also (ad Pammach. ep 48, c. 13), after defending the right
of writing [Greek: gymnastikôs], expressly said that all Greek philosophers "have used many
words to conceal their thoughts, threaten in one place, and deal the blow in another." In the
same way, according to him, Origen, Methodius, Eusebius, and Apollinaris had acted in the dispute
with Celsus and Porphyry. "Because they are sometimes compelled to say, not what they themselves
think, but what is necessary for their purpose; they do this only in the struggle with the
heathen."]

[Footnote 682: See, above all, the systematic main work "[Greek: peri archôn]".]

[Footnote 683: Many writings of Origen are pervaded by arguments, evincing equal discretion
and patience, against the Christians who contest the right of science in the Church. In the
work against Celsus, however, he was not unfrequently obliged to abandon the simple Christians.
C. Celsus III. 78: V. 14-24 are particularly instructive.]

[Footnote 684: In this point Origen is already narrower than Clement. Free judgments, such
as were passed by Clement on Greek philosophy, were not, so far as I know, repeated by Origen.
(See especially Clement, Strom. I. 5. 28-32: 13. 57, 58 etc.); yet he also acknowledges revelations
of God in Greek philosophy (see, e.g., c. Cels. VI. 3), and the Christian doctrine is to him
the completion of Greek philosophy (see the remains of Origen's lost Stromateis and Hom. XIV.
in Genes. § 3; other passages in Redepenning II., p. 324 ff.).]

[Footnote 685: We must here content ourselves with merely pointing out that the method of scientific
Scriptural exegesis also led to historico-critical investigations, that accordingly Origen
and his disciples were also critics of the tradition, and that scientific theology, in addition
to the task of remodelling Christianity, thus began at its very origin the solution of another
problem, namely, the critical restoration of Christianity from the Scriptures and tradition
and the removal of its excrescences: for these efforts, strictly speaking, do not come up for
consideration in the history of dogma.]

[Footnote 686: The theory that justified a twofold morality in the Church is now completely
legitimised, but the higher form no longer appears as Encratite and eschatological, but as
Encratite and philosophical. See, for example, Clement, Strom. III. 12. 82: VI. 13. 106 etc.
Gnosis is the principle of perfection. See Strom. IV. 7. 54: [Greek: prokeitai de tois eis
teleiôsin speudousin hê gnôsis hê logikê hês themelios hê agia trias pistis, agapê, elpis].]

[Footnote 687: See the preface to the work [Greek: peri archôn].]

[Footnote 688: From the conclusion of Hippolytus' Philosophoumena it is also evident how the
Socratic [Greek: Gnôthi seauton] was in that age based on a philosophy of religion and was
regarded as a watchword in wide circles. See Clem. Pædag. III. 11. 1.]

[Footnote 689: See Gregory Thaumaturgus' panegyric on Origen, one of the most instructive writings
of the 3rd century, especially cc. 11-18.]

[Footnote 690: Yet all excesses are repudiated. See Clem. Strom. IV. 22. 138: [Greek: Ouk egkratês
outos eti, all' en hexei gegonen apatheias schêma theion ependusasthai anamenôn]. Similar remarks
are found in Origen.]

[Footnote 691: In many passages of Clement the satisfaction in knowledge appears in a still
more pronounced form than in Origen. The boldest expression of it is Strom. IV. 22. 136. This
passage is quoted above on p. 328.]

[Footnote 692: See the beautiful prayer of the Christian Gnostic in Strom. IV. 23. 148.]

[Footnote 693: See Strom. IV. 26. 172: Origen's commentaries are continually interrupted by
similar outbursts of feeling.]

[Footnote 694: On deification as the ultimate aim see Clem., Strom. IV. 23. 149-155: VII. 10.
56, 13. 82, 16. 95: [Greek: houtôs ho tô kuriô peithomenos kai tê dotheisê di' autou katakolouthêsas
prophêteia teleôs ekteleitai kat' eikona tou didaskalou en sarki peripolôn Theos]. But note
what a distinction Clement makes between [Greek: ho Theos] and the perfect man in VII. 15.
88 (in contradistinction to the Stoic identification); Origen does this also.]

[Footnote 695: Gregory (l.c., c. 13) relates that all the works of the poets and philosophers
were read in Origen's school, and that every part of these works that would stand the test
was admitted. Only the works of atheists were excluded, "because these overpass the limits
of human thought." However, Origen did not judge philosophers in such an unprejudiced manner
as Clement, or, to speak more correctly, he no longer valued them so highly. See Bigg, l.c.,
p. 133, Denis l.c. Introd.]

[Footnote 696: See, for example, c. Cels. V. 43: VII. 47, 59 sq. He compared Plato and other
wise men to those doctors who give their attention only to cultured patients.]

[Footnote 697: See, for example, c. Cels. VI. 2.]

[Footnote 698: C. Cels. V. 43.]

[Footnote 699: One of Origen's main ideas, which we everywhere meet with, particularly in the
work against Celsus (see, for example, VI. 2) is the thought that Christ has come to improve
all men according to their several capacities, and to lead some to the highest knowledge. This
conception appears to fall short of the Christian ideal and perhaps really does so; but as
soon as we measure it not by the Gospel but by the aims of Greek philosophy, we see very clearly
the progress that has been attained through this same Gospel. What Origen has in his eye is
mankind, and he is anxious for the amendment not merely of a few, but of all. The actual state
of things in the Church no longer allowed him to repeat the exclamations of the Apologists
that all Christians were philosophers and that all were filled with the same wisdom and virtue.
These exclamations were naïve and inappropriate even for that time. But he could already estimate
the relative progress made by mankind within the Church as compared with those outside her
pale, saw no gulf between the growing and the perfect, and traced the whole advance to Christ.
He expressly declared, c. Cels. III. 78, that the Christianity which is fitted for the comprehension
of the multitude is not the best doctrine in an absolute, but only in a relative, sense; that
the "common man", as he expresses himself, must be reformed by the prospect of rewards and
punishments; and that the truth can only be communicated to him in veiled forms and images,
as to a child. The very fact, however, that the Logos in Jesus Christ has condescended so to
act is to Origen a proof of the universality of Christianity. Moreover, many of the wonderful
phenomena reported in the Holy Scriptures belong in his opinion to the veiled forms and images.
He is very far from doing violence to his reason here; he rather appeals to mysterious powers
of the soul, to powers of divination, visionary states etc. His standpoint in this case is
wholly that of Celsus (see particularly the instructive disquisition in I. 48), in so far as
he is convinced that many unusual things take place between heaven and earth, and that individual
names, symbols etc. possess a mysterious power (see, for example, c. Cels. V. 45). The views
as to the relationship between knowledge and holy initiation or sacramentum are those of the
philosophers of the age. He thinks, however, that each individual case requires to be examined,
that there can be no miracles not in accordance with nature, but that on the contrary everything
must fit into a higher order. As the letter of the precepts in both Testaments frequently contains
things contrary to reason (see [Greek: peri archôn] IV. 2. 8-27) in order to lead men to the
spiritual interpretation, and as many passages contain no literal sense at all (l.c. § 12),
so also, in the historical narratives, we frequently discover a mythical element from which
consequently nothing but the idea is to be evolved (l.c. § 16 sq.: "Non solum de his, quæ usque
ad adventum Christi scripta sunt, hæc Spiritus sanctus procuravit, sed ... eadem similiter
etiam in evangelistis et apostolis fecit. Nam ne illas quidem narrationes, quas per eos inspiravit,
absque huiuscemodi, quam supra exposuimus, sapientiæ suæ arte contexuit. Unde etiam in ipsis
non parva promiscuit, quibus historialis narrandi ordo interpolates, vel intercisus per impossibilitatem
sui reflecteret atque revocaret intentionem legentis ad intelligentiæ interioris examen.")
In all such cases Origen makes uniform use of the two points of view, that God wished to present
something even to the simple and to incite the more advanced to spiritual investigations. In
some passages, however, the former point of view fails, because the content of the text is
offensive; in that case it is only the second that applies. Origen therefore was very far from
finding the literal content of Scripture edifying in every instance, indeed, in the highest
sense, the letter is not edifying at all. He rather adopted, to its widest extent, the critical
method employed by the Gnostics particularly when dealing with the Old Testament; but the distinction
he made between the different senses of Scripture and between the various legitimate human
needs enabled him to preserve both the unity of God and the harmony of revelation. Herein,
both in this case and everywhere else, lies the superiority of his theology. Read especially
c. Celsum I. 9-12. After appealing to the twofold religion among the Egyptians, Persians, Syrians,
and Indians--the mythical religion of the multitude and the mystery-religion of the initiated--he
lays down exactly the same distinction within Christianity, and thus repels the reproach of
Celsus that the Christians were obliged to accept everything without examination. With regard
to the mythical form of Christianity he merely claims that it is the most suitable among religions
of this type. Since, as a matter of fact, the great majority of men have neither time nor talent
for philosophy, [Greek: poia an allê beltiôn methodos pros to tois pollois boêthêsai heuretheiê,
tês apo tou Iêsou tois ethnesi paradotheisês] (l.c., 9). This thought is quite in the spirit
of antiquity, and neither Celsus nor Porphyry could have any fault to find with these arguments
in point of form: all positive religions have a mythical element; the true religion therefore
lies behind the religions. But the novelty which neither Celsus nor Porphyry could recognise
lies in the acknowledgment that the one religion, even in its mythical form, is unique and
divine, and in the demand that all men, so far as they cannot attain the highest knowledge,
must subject themselves to this mythical religion and no other. In this claim Origen rejected
the ancient contrast between the multitude and the initiated just as he repudiated polytheism;
and in this, if I see rightly, his historical greatness consists. He everywhere recognised
gradations tending in the same direction and rejected polytheism.]

[Footnote 700: Bigg (l.c., p. 154) has rightly remarked: "Origen in point of method differs
most from Clement, who not unfrequently leaves us in doubt as to the precise Scriptural basis
of his ideas."]

[Footnote 701: Note, for example, § 8, where it is said that Origen adopted the allegorical
method from the Stoic philosophers and applied it to the Jewish writings. On Origen's hermeneutic
principles in their relation to those of Philo see Siegfried, l.c., pp. 351-62. Origen has
developed them fully and clearly in the 4th Book of [Greek: peri archôn].]

[Footnote 702: See Overbeck, Theologische Literatur-Zeitung, 1878, Col. 535.]

[Footnote 703: A full presentation of Origen's theology would require many hundreds of pages,
because he introduced everything worth knowing into the sphere of theology, and associated
with the Holy Scriptures, verse by verse, philosophical maxims, ethical reflexions, and results
of physical science, which would require to be drawn on the widest canvas, because the standpoint
selected by Origen allowed the most extensive view and the most varied judgments. The case
was similar with Clement before him, and also with Tertullian. This is a necessary result of
"Scripture theology" when one takes it up in earnest. Tertullian assumes, for example, that
there must be a Christian doctrine of dreams. Why? Because we read of dreams in the Holy Scriptures.]

[Footnote 704: In c. Cels. III. 61 it is said (Lommatzsch XVIII., p. 337): [Greek: epemphthê
oun Theos logos katho men iatros tois hamartôlois, katho de didaskalos theiôn mustêrion tois
êdê katharois kai mêketi hamartanousin.] See also what follows. In Comment. in John I. 20 sq.
the crucified Christ, as the Christ of faith, is distinguished from the Christ who takes up
his abode in us, as the Christ of the perfect. See 22 (Lomm. I. p. 43): [Greek: kai makarioi
ge hosoi deomenoi tou huiou tou Theou toioutoi gegonasin, hôs mêketi autou chrazein iatrou
tous kakôs hechontas therapeuontos, mêde poimenos, mêde apolutrôseôs, alla sophias kai logou
kai dikaiosunês, hê ei ti allo tois dia teleiotêta chôrein autou ta kallista dunamenois.] Read
also c. Cels. II. 66, 69: IV. 15, 18: VI. 68. These passages show that the crucified Christ
is no longer of any account to the Gnostic, and that he therefore allegorises all the incidents
described in the Gospels. Clement, too, really regards Christ as of no importance to Gnostics
except as a teacher.]

[Footnote 705: Comment, in Joh. I. 9, Lomm. I. p, 20. The "mysteries" of Christ is the technical
term for this theology and, at bottom, for all theology. For, in respect of the form given
to it, revelation always appears as a problem that theology has to solve. What is revealed
is therefore either to be taken as immediate authority (by the believer) or as a soluble problem.
One thing, accordingly, it is not, namely, something in itself evident and intelligible.]

[Footnote 706: See Nitzsch, Dogmengeschichte, p. 136.]

[Footnote 707: To Origen the problem of evil was one of the most important; see Book III. of
[Greek: peri archôn] and c. Cels. VI. 53-59. He is convinced (1) that the world is not the
work of a second, hostile God; (2) that virtues and the works arising from them are alone good
in the proper sense of the word, and that nothing but the opposite of these is bad; (3) that
evil in the proper sense of the word is only evil will (see c. Cels. IV. 66: VI. 54). Accordingly
he makes a very decided distinction between that which is bad and evils. As for the latter
he admits that they partly originate from God, in which case they are designed as means of
training and punishment. But he saw that this conception is insufficient, both in view of individual
passages of Holy Scripture and of natural experience. There are evils in the world that can
be understood neither as the result of sin nor as means of training. Here then his relative,
rational view of things comes in, even with respect to the power of God. There are evils which
are a necessary consequence of carrying out even the best intentions (c. Cels. VI. 53: [Greek:
ta kaka ek parakolouthêseôs gegenêtai tês pros ta proêgoumena]): "Evils, in the strict sense,
are not created by God; yet some, though but few in comparison with the great, well-ordered
whole of the world, have of necessity adhered to the objects realised; as the carpenter who
executes the plan of a building does not manage without chips and similar rubbish, or as architects
cannot be made responsible for the dirty heaps of broken stones and filth one sees at the sites
of buildings;" (l.c., c. 55). Celsus also might have written in this strain. The religious,
absolute view is here replaced by a rational, and the world is therefore not the best absolutely,
but the best possible. See the Theodicy in [Greek: peri archôn] III. 17-22. (Here, and also
in other parts, Origen's Theodicy reminds us of that of Leibnitz; see Denis, l.c., p. 626 sq.
The two great thinkers have a very great deal in common, because their philosophy was not of
a radical kind, but an attempt to give a rational interpretation to tradition.) But "for the
great mass it is sufficient when they are told that evil has not its origin in God" (IV. 66).
The case is similar with that which is really bad. It is sufficient for the multitude to know
that that which is bad springs from the freedom of the creature, and that matter which is inseparable
from things mortal is not the source and cause of sin (IV. 66, see also III, 42: [Greek: to
kuriôs miaron apo kakias toiouton esti. Phusis de sômatos ou miara ou gar hê phusis sômatos
esti, to gennêtikon tês miarotêtos echei tên kakian]); but a closer examination shows that
there can be no man without sin (III. 6l) because error is inseparable from growth and because
the constitution of man in the flesh makes evil unavoidable (VII. 50). Sinfulness is therefore
natural and it is the necessary prius. This thought, which is also not foreign to Irenæus,
is developed by Origen with the utmost clearness. II., p. 234 ff.)]

[Footnote 709: The distinction between Valentinus and Origen consists in the fact that the
former makes an æon or, in other words, a part of the divine pleroma, itself fall, and that
he does not utilise the idea of freedom. The outline of Origen's system cannot be made out
with complete clearness from the work [Greek: peri archôn], because he endeavoured to treat
each of the first three parts as a whole. Origen's four principles are God, the World, Freedom,
Revelation (Holy Scripture). Each principle, however, is brought into relation with Christ.
The first part treats of God and the spirits, and follows the history of the latter down to
their restoration. The second part treats of the world and humanity, and likewise closes with
the prospect of the resurrection, punishment in hell, and eternal life. Here Origen makes a
magnificent attempt to give a conception of bliss and yet to exclude all sensuous joys. The
third book treats of sin and redemption, that is, of freedom of will, temptation, the struggle
with the powers of evil, internal struggles, the moral aim of the world, and the restoration
of all things. A special book on Christ is wanting, for Christ is no "principle"; but the incarnation
is treated of in II. 6. The teachers of Valentinus' school accordingly appear more Christian
when contrasted with Origen. If we read the great work [Greek: peri archôn], or the treatise
against Celsus, or the commentaries connectedly, we never cease to wonder how a mind so clear,
so sure of the ultimate aim of all knowledge, and occupying such a high standpoint, has admitted
in details all possible views down to the most naive myths, and how he on the one hand believes
in holy magic, sacramental vehicles and the like, and on the other, in spite of all his rational
and even empirical views, betrays no doubt of his abstract creations. But the problem that
confronts us in Origen is that presented by his age. This we realise on reading Celsus or Porphyry
(see Denis l.c., p. 613: "Toutes les théories d'Origène, même les plus imaginaires, représent
l'état intellectuel et moral du siècle où il a paru"). Moreover, Origen is not a teacher who,
like Augustine, was in advance of his time, though he no doubt anticipated the course of ecclesiastical
development. This age, as represented by its greatest men, sought to gain a substructure for
something new, not by a critical examination of the old ideas, but by incorporating them all
into one whole. People were anxious to have assurance, and, in the endeavour to find this,
they were nervous about giving up any article of tradition. The boldness of Origen, judged
as a Greek philosopher, lies in his rejection of all polytheistic religions. This made him
all the more conservative in his endeavours to protect and incorporate everything else. This
conservatism welded together ecclesiastical Christianity and Greek culture into a system of
theology which was indeed completely heterodox.]

[Footnote 710: The proof from prophecy was reckoned by Origen among the articles belonging
to faith, but not to Gnosis (see for ex. c. Cels. II. 37); but, like the Apologists, he found
it of great value. As far as the philosophers are concerned, Origen always bore in mind the
principle expressed in c. Cels. VII. 46: [Greek: pros tauta d'êmeis phêsomen hoi meletêsantes
mêdeni apechthanesthai tôn kalôs legomenôn; kan hoi hexô tês pisteôs legôusi kalôs.] In that
same place it is asserted that God in his love has not only revealed himself to such as entirely
consecrate themselves to his service, but also to such as do not know the true adoration and
reverence which he requires. But as remarked above, p. 338, Origen's attitude to the Greek
philosophers is much more reserved than that of Clement.]

[Footnote 711: See, for ex., c. Cels. VI. 6, Comment in Johann. XIII. 59, Lomm. II., p. 9 sq.]

[Footnote 712: [Greek: Peri archôn] preface.]

[Footnote 713: On Origen's exegetical method see Kihn, Theodor v. Mopsu. p. 20 ff., Bigg, l.c.
p. 131 ff. On the distinction between his application of the allegorical method and that of
Clement see specially p. 134 f. of the latter work.]

[Footnote 714: Origen noted several such passages in the very first chapter of Genesis. Examples
are given in Bigg, p. 137 f.]

[Footnote 715: Bigg, l.c., has very appropriately named Origen's allegorism "Biblical alchemy".]

[Footnote 716: To ascertain the pneumatic sense, Origen frequently drew analogies between the
domain of the cosmic and that of the spiritual. He is thus a forerunner of modern idealistic
philosophers, for example, Drummond: "To Origen allegorism is only one manifestation of the
sacramental mystery of nature" (Bigg, p. 134).]

[Footnote 717: See Hom in Luc. XXIX., Lomm. V., p. 193 sq.]

[Footnote 718: Since Origen does not, as a rule, dispute the literal meaning of the Scriptures,
he has also a much more favourable opinion of the Jewish people and of the observance of the
law than the earlier Christian authors (but see Iren. and Tertull.). At bottom he places the
observance of the law quite on the same level as the faith of the simple Christians. The Apostles
also kept the law for a time, and it was only by degrees that they came to understand its spiritual
meaning. They were also right to continue its observance during their mission among the Jews.
On the other hand, he considers the New Testament a higher stage than the Old both in its literal
and its spiritual sense. See c. Cels. II. 1-4, 7, 75: IV. 31 sq: V. 10, 30, 31, 42 sq., 66:
VII. 26.]

[Footnote 719: In opposition to the method for obtaining a knowledge of God, recommended by
Alcinous (c. 12), Maximus Tyr. (XVII. 8), and Celsus (by analysis [apophat.], synthesis [kataphat.],
and analogy), Origen, c. Cels. VII. 42, 44, appeals to the fact that the Christian knows God
better, namely, in his incarnate Son. But he himself, nevertheless, also follows the synthetic
method.]

[Footnote 720: In defining the superessential nature of the One, Origen did not go so far as
the Basilidians (Philosoph. VII. 20, 21) or as Plotinus. No doubt he also regards the Deity
as [Greek: epekeina tês ousias] (c. Cels. VII. 42-51; [Greek: peri archôn] I. 1; Clement made
a closer approach to the heretical abstractions of the Gnostics inasmuch as he still more expressly
renounced any designation of God; see Strom. V. 12, 13), but he is not [Greek: buthos] and
[Greek: sigê], being rather a self-comprehending Spirit, and therefore does not require a hypostasis
(the [Greek: nous]) before he can come to himself. Accordingly the human intellect is not incapable
of soaring up to God as the later Neoplatonists assert; at least vision is by no means so decidedly
opposed to thought, that is, elevated above it as something new, as is held by the Neoplatonists
and Philo before them. Origen is no mystic. In accordance with this conception Origen and Clement
say that the perfect knowledge of God can indeed be derived from the Logos alone (c. Cels VII.
48, 49: VI. 65-73; Strom. V. 12. 85: VI. 15. 122), but that a relative knowledge may be deduced
from creation (c. Cels. VII. 46). Hence they also spoke of an innate knowledge of God (Protrept.
VI. 68; Strom. V. 13. 78), and extended the teleological proof of God furnished by Philo ([Greek:
peri archôn] I. 1. 6; c. Cels I. 23). The relatively correct predicates of God to be determined
from revelation are his unity (c. Cels I. 23), his absolute spirituality ([Greek: pneuma asômatos,
aulos, aschêmatistos])--this is maintained both in opposition to Stoicism and anthropomorphism;
see Orig. [Greek: peri archôn] I. 1, Origen's polemic against Melito's conception of God, and
Clem., Strom. V. 11. 68: V. 12. 82,--his unbegottenness, his immortality (this is eternity
conceived as enjoyment; the eternity of God itself, however, is to be conceived, according
to Clement, as that which is above time; see Strom. II. 2. 6), and his absolute causality.
All these concepts together constitute the conception of perfection. See Fischer, De Orig.
theologia et cosmologia, 1840.]

[Footnote 726: See c. Cels. II. 20.]

[Footnote 727: Clement also did so; see with respect to Origen [Greek: peri archôn] II. 5,
especially § 3 sq.]

[Footnote 728: See Comment. in Johann. I. 40, Lomm. I. p. 77 sq. I cannot agree that this view
is a rapprochement to the Marcionites (contrary to Nitzsch's opinion, l.c., p. 285). The confused
accounts in Epiph., H. 43. 13 are at any rate not to be taken into account.]

[Footnote 729: Clement's doctrine of the Logos, to judge from the Hypotyposes, was perhaps
different from that of Origen. According to Photius (Biblioth. 109) Clement assumed two Logoi
(Origen indeed was also reproached with the same; see Pamphili Apol., Routh, Reliq. S., IV.,
p. 367), and did not even allow the second and weaker one to make a real appearance on earth;
but this is a misunderstanding (see Zahn, Forschungen III., p. 144). [Greek: Legetai men]--these
are said to have been the words of a passage in the Hypotyposes--[Greek: kai ho huios logos
homônumôs tô patrikô logô, all' ouch outos estin ho sarx genomenos, oude men ho patrôos logos,
alla dynamis tis tou Theou, oion apporoia tou logou autou nous genomenos tas tôn anthrôpôn
kardias diapephoitêke]. The distinction between an impersonal Logos-God and the Logos-Christ
necessarily appeared as soon as the Logos was definitely hypostatised. In the so-called Monarchian
struggles of the 3rd century the disputants made use of these two Logoi, who formed excellent
material for sophistical discussions. In the Strom. Clement did not reject the distinction
between a [Greek: logos endiathetos] and [Greek: prophorikos] (on Strom. V. 1. 6. see Zahn,
l.c., p. 145 against Nitzsch), and in many passages expresses himself in such a way that one
can scarcely fail to notice a distinction between the Logos of the Father and that of the Son.
"The Son-Logos is an emanation of the Reason of God, which unalterably remains in God and is
the Logos proper." If the Adumbrationes are to be regarded as parts of the Hypotyposes, Clement
used the expression [Greek: homoousios] for the Logos, or at least an identical one (See Zahn,
Forschungen III., pp. 87-138 f.). This is the more probable because Clement, Strom. 16. 74,
expressly remarked that men are not [Greek: meros theou kai tô Theô homoousioi], and because
he says in Strom. IV. 13. 91: [Greek: ei epi to katalusai thanaton aphikneitai to diapheron
genos, ouch ho Christos ton thanaton katêrgêsen, ei mê kai autos autois homoousios lechtheiê].
One must assume from this that the word was really familiar to Clement as a designation of
the community of nature, possessed by the Logos, both with God and with men. See Protrept.
10. 110: [Greek: ho theios logos, ho phanerôtatos ontôs Theos, ho tô despotê tôn holôn exisôtheis]).
In Strom. V. I. 1 Clement emphatically declared that the Son was equally eternal with the Father:
[Greek: ou mên oude ho patêr aneu huiou hama gar tô patêr huiou patêr] (see also Strom. IV.
7. 58: [Greek: hen mên to agennêton ho pantokratôr, en de kai to progennêthen di' ou ta panta
egeneto], and Adumbrat. in Zahn, l.c., p. 87, where 1 John I. 1 is explained: "principium generationis
separatum ab opificis principio non est. Cum enim dicit 'quod erat ab initio' generationem
tangit sine principio filii cum patre simul exstantis." See besides the remarkable passage,
Quis dives salv. 37: [Greek: Theô ta tês agapês mystêria, kai tote epopteuseis ton kolpon tou
patros, hon ho monogenês huios Theos monos exêgêsato esti de kai autos ho Theos agapê kai di'
agapên hêmin anekrathê kai to men arrêton autou patêr, to de hêmin sympathes gegone mêtêr agapêsas
ho patêr ethêlunthê, kai toutou mega sêmeion, hon autos egennêsen ex autou kai ho techtheis
ex agapês karpos agapê]. But that does not exclude the fact that he, like Origen, named the
Son [Greek: ktisma] (Phot., l.c.). In the Adumbrat. (p. 88) Son and Spirit are called "primitivæ
virtutes ac primo creatæ, immobiles exsistentes secundum substantiam". That is exactly Origen's
doctrine, and Zahn (l.c., p. 99) has rightly compared Strom. V. 14. 89: VI. 7. 58; and Epit.
ex Theod. 20. The Son stands at the head of the series of created beings (Strom. VII. 2. 5;
see also below), but he is nevertheless specifically different from them by reason of his origin.
It may be said in general that the fine distinctions of the Logos doctrine in Clement and Origen
are to be traced to the still more abstract conception of God found in the former. A sentence
like Strom. IV. 25. 156 ([Greek: ho men oun Theos anapodeiktos ôn ouk estin epistêmonikos,
ho de huios sophia te esti kai epistêmê]) will hardly be found in Origen I think. Cf. Schultz,
Gottheit Christi, p. 45 ff.]

[Footnote 730: See Schultz, l.c., p. 51 ff. and Jahrbuch fur protestantische Theologie I. pp.
193 ff. 369 ff.]

[Footnote 731: It is very remarkable that Origen [Greek: peri archôn] I. 2. 1 in his presentation
of the Logos doctrine, started with the person of Christ, though he immediately abandoned this
starting-point "Primo illud nos oportere scire", so this chapter begins, "Quod aliud est in
Christo deitatis eius natura, quod est unigenitus filius patris, et alia humana natura, quam
in novissimis temporibus pro dispensatione suscepit. Propter quod videndum primo est, quid
sit unigenitus filius dei."]

[Footnote 732: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 2. 2, 6.]

[Footnote 733: The expression was familiar to Origen as to Justin (see Dial. c. Tryph). See
c. Cels. V. 39: [Greek: Kai deuteron oun legômen Theon istôsan, hoti ton deuteron Theon ouk
allo ti legomen, hê tên periektikên pasôn aretôn aretên kai ton periektikon pantos houtinosoun
logou tôn kata physin kai proêgoumenôs gegenêmenôn.]]

[Footnote 734: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 2. 13 has been much corrupted by Rufinus. The passage
must have been to the effect that the Son is indeed [Greek: agathos], but not, like the Father,
[Greek: aparallaktôs agathos].]

[Footnote 735: Selecta in Psalm., Lomm. XIII., p. 134; see also Fragm. comm. in ep. ad Hebr.,
Lomm. V., p. 299 sq.]

[Footnote 736: L.c.: "Sic et sapientia ex deo procedens, ex ipsa substantia dei generatur.
Sic nihilominus et secundum similitudinem corporalis aporrhoeæ esse dicitur aporrhoea gloriæ
omnipotentis pura quædam et sincera. Quæ utræque similitudines (see the beginning of the passage)
manifestissime ostendunt communionem substantiæ esse filio cum patre. Aporrhoea enim [Greek:
homoousios] videtur, id est, unius substantiæ cum illo corpore, ex quo est vel aporrhoea vel
vapor." In opposition to Heracleon Origen argues (in Joh. XIII. 25., Lomm. II., p. 43 sq.)
that we are not homousios with God: [Greek: epistêsômen de, ei me sphodra estin asebes homoousios
tê agennêtô physei kai pammakaria einai legein tous proskunountas en pneumati tô Theô.] On
the meaning of [Greek: homoousios] see Zahn, Marcell., pp. 11-32. The conception decidedly
excludes the possibility of the two subjects connected by it having a different essence; but
it says nothing about how they came to have one essence and in what measure they possess it.
On the other hand it abolishes the distinction of persons the moment the essence itself is
identified with the one person. Here then is found the Unitarian danger, which could only be
averted by assertions. In some of Origen's teachings a modalistic aspect is also not quite
wanting. See Hom. VIII. in Jerem. no. 2: [Greek: To men hupokeimenon hen esti, tais de epinoiais
ta polla onomata epi diaphorôn]. Conversely, it is also nothing but an appearance when Origen
(for ex. in c. Cels. VIII. 12) merely traces the unity of Father and Son to unity in feeling
and in will. The charge of Ebionitism made against him is quite unfounded (see Pamphili Apol.,
Routh IV. p. 367).]

principia lucis videamur inducere, sed sicut ingenitæ lucis splendor, ipsam illam lucem initium
habens ac fontem, natus quidem ex ipsa; sed non erat quando noa erat." See the comprehensive
disquisition in [Greek: peri archôn] IV. 28, where we find the sentence: "hoc autem ipsum,
quod dicimus, quia nunquam fuit, quando non fuit, cum venia audiendum est" etc. See further

distinction.]

[Footnote 744: C. Cels. VIII. 12.: [Greek: duo tê hypostasei pragmata]. This was frequently
urged against the Monarchians in Origen's commentaries; see in Joh. X. 21: II. 6 etc. The Son
exists [Greek: kat' idian tês ousias perigraphên]. Not that Origen has not yet the later terminology
[Greek: ousia, hypostasis, hypokeimenon, prosôpon]. We find three hypostases in Joh. II. 6.
Lomm. I., p. 109, and this is repeatedly the case in c. Cels.]

[Footnote 745: In Joh. I. 22, Lomm. I., p. 41 sq.: [Greek: ho Theos men oun pantê hen esti
kai aploun ho de sôtêr hêmôn dia ta polla]. The Son is [Greek: idea ideôn, systêma theôrêmatôn
en autô](Lomm. I., p. 127).]

[Footnote 746: See the remarks on the saying: "The Father is greater than I," in Joh. XIII.
25, Lomm. II., p. 45 sq. and other passages. Here Origen shows that he considers the homoousia
of the Son and the Father just as relative as the unchangeability of the Son.]

[Footnote 747: [Greek: Peri archôn] II. 2. 6 has been corrupted by Rufinus; see Jerome ep.
ad Avitum.]

[Footnote 748: See [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 2. 13 (see above, p. 354, note 3).]

[Footnote 749: Athanasius supplemented this by determining the essence of the Logos from the
redeeming work of Christ.]

[Footnote 750: See [Greek: peri archôn] præf. and in addition to this Hermas' view of the Spirit.]

[Footnote 751: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 3. The Holy Spirit is eternal, is ever being breathed
out, but is to be termed a creature. See also in Job. II. 6, Lomm. I., p. 109 sq.: [Greek:
to hagion pneuma dia tou logou egeneto, presbuterou] (logically) [Greek: par' auto tou logou
tugchanontos]. Yet Origen is not so confident here as in his Logos doctrine.]

[Footnote 752: See [Greek: peri archôn] I. 3, 5-8. Hence Origen says the heathen had known
the Father and Son, but not the Holy Spirit (de princip. I. 3: II. 7).]

[Footnote 753: L.c. § 7.]

[Footnote 754: See Hom. in Num. XII. I, Lomm. X, p. 127: "Est hæc trium distinctio personarum

puteorum unum est fons. Una enim substantia est et natura trinitatis."]

[Footnote 755: [Greek: Peri archôn] præf.]

[Footnote 756: From Hermas, Justin, and Athenagoras we learn how, in the 2nd century, both
in the belief of uneducated lay-Christians and of the Apologists, Son, Spirit, Logos, and angels
under certain circumstances shaded off into one another. To Clement, no doubt, Logos and Spirit
are the only unchangeable beings besides God. But, inasmuch as there is a series which descends
from God to men living in the flesh, there cannot fail to be elements of affinity between Logos
and Spirit on the one hand and the highest angels on the other, all of whom indeed have the
capacity and need of development. Hence they have certain names and predicates in common, and
it frequently remains uncertain, especially as regards the theophanies in the Old Testament,
whether it was a high angel that spoke, or the Son through the angel. See the full discussion
in Zahn, Forschungen, III., p. 98 f.]

[Footnote 757: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 5.]

[Footnote 758: So also Clement, see Zahn, l.c.]

[Footnote 759: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 5. 2.]

[Footnote 760: It was of course created before the world, as it determines the course of the
world. See Comm. in Matth. XV. 27, Lomm. III., p. 384 sq.]

[Footnote 761: See Comm. in Joh. XIII. 25, Lomm. II, p. 45: we must not look on the human spirit
as [Greek: homoousios] with the divine one. The same had already been expressly taught by Clement.
See Strom., II. 16. 74: [Greek: ho Theos oudemian echei pros hêmas physikên schesin hôs hoi
tôn haireseôn ktistai thelousin]. Adumbr., p. 91 (ed. Zahn). This does not exclude God and
souls having quodammodo one substance.]

[Footnote 762: Such is the teaching of Clement and Origen. They repudiated the possession of
any natural, essential goodness in the case of created spirits. If such lay in their essence,
these spirits would be unchangeable.]

[Footnote 763: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 2. 10: "Quemadmodum pater non potest esse quis, si filius
non sit, neque dominus quis esse potest sine possessione, sine servo, ita ne omnipotens quidem
deus dici potest, si non sint, in quos exerceat potentatum, et deo ut omnipotens ostendatur
deus, omnia subsistere necesse est." (So the Hermogenes against whom Tertullian wrote had already
argued). "Nam si quis est, qui velit vel sæcula aliqua vel spatia transisse, vel quodcunque
aliud nominare vult, cum nondum facta essent, quæ facta sunt, sine dubio hoc ostendet, quod
in illis sæculis vel spatiis omnipotens non erat deus et postmodum omnipotens factus est."
God would therefore, it is said in what follows, be subjected to a [Greek: prokopê], and thus
be proved to be a finite being. III. 5. 3.]

[Footnote 764: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 8.]

[Footnote 765: Here, however, Origen is already thinking of the temporary wrong development
that is of growth. See [Greek: peri archôn] I. 7. Created spirits are also of themselves immaterial,
though indeed not in the sense that this can be said of God who can never attach anything material
to himself.]

[Footnote 766: Angels, ideas (see Phot. Biblioth. 109), and human souls are most closely connected
together, both according to the theory of Clement and Origen and also to that of Pantænus before
them (see Clem. eclog. 56, 57); and so it was taught that men become angels (Clem. Strom. VI.
13. 107). But the stars also, which are treated in great detail in [Greek: peri archôn] I.
7, belong to the number of the angels. This is a genuinely Greek idea. The doctrine of the
preëxistence of human souls was probably set forth by Clement in the Hypotyposes. The theory
of the transmigration of souls was probably found there also (Phot. Biblioth. 109). In the
Adumbrat., which has been preserved to us, the former doctrine is, however, contested and is
not found in the Stromateis VI. 16. I. sq.]

[Footnote 767: Phot. Biblioth. 109: [Greek: Klêmês pollous pro tou Adam kosmous terateuetai].
This cannot be verified from the Strom. Orig., [Greek: peri archôn] II. 3.]

[Footnote 768: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 5 and the whole 3rd Book. The Fall is something that
happened before time began.]

[Footnote 769: The assumption of uncreated matter was decidedly rejected by Origen ([Greek:
peri archôn] II. 1, 2). On the other hand Clement is said to have taught it in the Hypotyposes
(Phot., l.c.: [Greek: hulên archronon doxazei]); this cannot be noticed in the Strom.; in fact
in VI. 16. 147 he vigorously contested the view of the uncreatedness of the world. He emphasised
the agreement between Plato and Moses in the doctrine of creation (Strom. II. 16. 74 has nothing
to do with this). According to Origen, matter has no qualities and may assume the most diverse
peculiarities (see, e.g., c. Cels. III. 41).]

[Footnote 770: This conception has given occasion to compare Origen's system with Buddhism.
Bigg. (p. 193) has very beautifully said: "Creation, as the word is commonly understood, was
in Origen's views not the beginning, but an intermediate phase in human history. Æons rolled
away before this world was made; æons upon æons, days, weeks, months and years, sabbatical
years, jubilee years of æons will run their course, before the end is attained. The one fixed
point in this gigantic drama is the end, for this alone has been clearly revealed," "God shall
be all in all." Bigg also rightly points out that Rom. VIII. and 1 Cor. XV. were for Origen
the key to the solution of the problems presented by creation.]

[Footnote 771: The popular idea of demons and angels was employed by Origen in the most comprehensive
way, and dominates his whole view of the present course of the world. See [Greek: peri archôn]
III. 2. and numerous passages in the Commentaries and Homilies, in which he approves the kindred
views of the Greeks as well as of Hermas and Barnabas. The spirits ascend and descend; each
man has his guardian spirit, and the superior spirits support the inferior ([Greek: peri archôn]
I. 6). Accordingly they are also to be reverenced ([Greek: therapeuesthai]); yet such reverence
as belongs to a Gabriel, a Michael, etc., is far different from the adoration of God (c. Cels.
VIII. 13).]

[Footnote 772: Clement wrote a special work [Greek: peri pronoias] (see Zahn, Forschungen III.,
p. 39 ff.), and treated at length of [Greek: pronoia] in the Strom.; see Orig. [Greek: peri
archôn] III. 1; de orat. 6 etc. Evil is also subject to divine guidance; see Clem., Strom.
I. 17. 81-87: IV. 12. 86 sq. Orig. Hom. in Num. XIV., Lomm. X., p. 163: "Nihil otiosum, nihil
inane est apud deum, quia sive bono proposito hominis utitur ad bona sive malo ad necessaria."
Here and there, however, Origen has qualified the belief in Providence, after the genuine fashion
of antiquity (see c. Gels. IV. 74).]

[Footnote 773: [Greek: Peri archôn] II. 9. 2: "Recedere a bono, non aliud est quam effici in
malo. Ceterum namque est, malum esse bono canere. Ex quo accidit, ut in quanta mensura quis
devolveretur a bono, in tantam mensuram malitiæ deveniret." In the passage in Johann. II. 7,
Lomm. I., p. 115, we find a closely reasoned exposition of evil as [Greek: anupostaton] and
an argument to the effect that [Greek: ta ponêra] are--[Greek: mê onta].]

[Footnote 774: [Greek: Peri archôn] I. 5. 3: III. 6. The devil is the chief of the apostate
angels (c. Cels. IV. 65). As a reasonable being he is a creature of God (l.c., and in Joh.
II. 7, Lomm., l.c.).]

[Footnote 775: Origen defended the teleology culminating in man against Celsus' attacks on
it; but his assumption that the spirits of men are only a part of the universal spirit world
is, as a matter of fact, quite akin to Celsus' view. If we consider the plan of the work [Greek:
peri archôn] we easily see that to Origen humanity was merely an element in the cosmos.]

[Footnote 776: The doctrine of man's threefold constitution is also found in Clement. See Pædag.
III. 1. 1; Strom V. 14. 94: VI. 16. 134. (quite in the manner of Plato). Origen, who has given
evidence of it in all his main writings, sometimes calls the rational part spirit, sometimes
[Greek: psychê logikê], and at other times distinguishes two parts in the one soul. Of course
he also professes to derive his psychology from the Holy Scriptures. The chief peculiarity
of his speculation consists in his assumption that the human spirit, as a fallen one, became
as it were a soul, and can develop from that condition partly into a spirit as before and partly
into the flesh (see [Greek: peri archôn] III. 4. 1 sq.: II. 8. 1-5). By his doctrine of the
preëxistence of souls Origen excluded both the creation and traducian hypotheses of the origin
of the soul.]

[Footnote 777: Clement (see Strom. II. 22. 131) gives the following as the opinion of some
Christian teachers: [Greek: to men kat' eikona eutheôs kata tên genesin eilêphenai ton anthrôpon,
to kath' homoiôsin de usteron kata tên peleiôsin mellein apolambanein]. Orig. c. Cels. IV.
30: [Greek: epoiête d'o Theos ton anthrôpon kat' eikona Theos, all' ouchi kath' homoiôsin êdê].]

[Footnote 778: This follows from the fundamental psychological view and is frequently emphasised.
One must attain the [Greek: sôphorsynê].]

[Footnote 779: This is emphasised throughout. The goodness of God is shown first in his having
given the creature reason and freedom, and secondly in acts of assistance, which, however,
do not endanger freedom. Clem.; Strom. VI. 12, 96: [Greek: hêmas ex hêmôn autôn bouletai sôzesthai].]

[Footnote 780: See above, p. 344, and p. 361, note 5. Origen continually emphasised the universality
of sin in the strongest expressions: c. Cels. III. 61-66: VII. 50; Clem., Pæd. III. 12. 93:
[Greek: to examartanein pasin emphyton].]

[Footnote 781: See Clem., Strom. VII. 16. 101: [Greek: myriôn goun ontôn kat' arithmon ha prassousin
anthrôpoi schedon duo eisin archai pasês hamartias, agnoia kai astheneia, amphô de eph' hêmin,
tôn mête ethelontôn manthanein mête au tês epithymias kratein]. Two remedies correspond to
this (102): [Greek: hê gnôsis te kai hê tês ek tôn graphôn martyrias enargês apodeixis] and
[Greek: hê kata logon askêsis ek pisteôs te kai phobou paidagôgoumenê], or otherwise expressed:
[Greek: hê theôria hê epistêmonikê] and [Greek: hê praxis] which lead to perfect love.]

[Footnote 782: Freedom is not prejudiced by the idea of election that is found here and there,
for this idea is not worked out. In Clem., Strom. VI. 9. 76, it is said of the friend of God,
the true Gnostic, that God has destined ([Greek: proôrisen]) him to sonship before the foundation
of the world. See VII. 17. 107.]

[Footnote 783: C. Cels. III. 69.]

[Footnote 784: It is both true that men have the same freedom as Adam and that they have the
same evil instincts. Moreover, Origen conceived the story of Adam symbolically. See c. Cels.
IV. 40; [Greek: peri archôn] IV. 16; in Levit. hom. VI. 2. In his later writings, after he
had met with the practice of child baptism in Cæsarea and prevailed on himself to regard it
as apostolic, he also assumed the existence of a sort of hereditary sin originating with Adam,
and added it to his idea of the preëxisting Fall. Like Augustine after him, he also supposed
that there was an inherent pollution in sexual union; see in Rom. V. 9: VII. 4; in Lev. hom.
VIII. 3; in Num. hom. 2 (Bigg, p. 202 f.).]

[Footnote 785: Nevertheless Origen assumes that some souls are invested with flesh, not for
their own sins, but in order to be of use to others. See in Joh. XIII. 43 ad fin; II. 24, 25;
in Matth. XII. 30.]

[Footnote 786: Origen again and again strongly urged the necessity of divine grace.]

[Footnote 787: See on this point Bigg, pp. 207 ff., 223 f. Origen is the father of Joachim
and all spiritualists.]

[Footnote 788: See Knittel, Orig. Lehre von der Menschwerdung (Tübinger Theologische Quartalschrift,
1872). Ramers, Orig. Lehre von der Auferstehung des Fleisches, 1851. Schultz, Gottheit Christi,
pp. 51-62.]

[Footnote 789: With regard to this point we find the same explanation in Origen as in Irenæus
and Tertullian, and also among the Valentinians, in so far as the latter describe the redemption
necessary for the Psychici. Only, in this instance also, everything is more copious in his
case, because he availed himself of the Holy Scriptures still more than these did, and because
he left out no popular conception that seemed to have any moral value. Accordingly he propounded
views as to the value of salvation and as to the significance of Christ's death on the cross,
with a variety and detail rivalled by no theologian before him. He was, as Bigg (p. 209 ff.)
has rightly noticed, the first Church theologian after Paul's time that gave a detailed theology
of sacrifices. We may mention here the most important of his views. (1) The death on the cross
along with the resurrection is to be considered as a real, recognisable victory over the demons,
inasmuch as Christ (Col. II. 14) exposed the weakness of his enemies (a very frequent aspect
of the matter). (2) The death on the cross is to be considered as an expiation offered to God.
Here Origen argued that all sins require expiation, and, conversely, that all innocent blood
has a greater or less importance according to the value of him who gives up his life. (3) In
accordance with this the death of Christ has also a vicarious signification (see with regard
to both these conceptions the treatise Exhort, ad martyr., as well as c. Cels. VII. 17: I.
31; in Rom. t. III. 7, 8, Lomm. VI., pp. 196-216 etc.). (4) The death of Christ is to be considered
as a ransom paid to the devil. This view must have been widely diffused in Origen's time; it
readily suggested itself to the popular idea and was further supported by Marcionite theses.
It was also accepted by Origen who united it with the notion of a deception practised on the
devil, a conception first found among the Basilidians. By his successful temptation the devil
acquired a right over men. This right cannot be destroyed, but only bought off. God offers
the devil Christ's soul in exchange for the souls of men. This proposal of exchange was, however,
insincere, as God knew that the devil could not keep hold of Christ's soul, because a sinless
soul could not but cause him torture. The devil agreed to the bargain and was duped. Christ
did not fall into the power of death and the devil, but overcame both. This theory, which Origen
propounded in somewhat different fashion in different places (see Exhort ad martyr. 12; in
Matth. t. XVI. 8, Lomm. IV., p. 27; t. XII. 28, Lomm. III., p. 175; t. XIII. 8, 9, Lomm. III.,
pp. 224-229; in Rom. II. 13, Lomm. VI., p. 139 sq. etc.), shows in a specially clear way the
conservative method of this theologian, who would not positively abandon any idea. No doubt
it shows at the same time how uncertain Origen was as to the applicability of popular conceptions
when he was dealing with the sphere of the Psychici. We must here remember the ancient idea
that we are not bound to sincerity towards our enemies. (5) Christ, the God who became flesh,
is to be considered as high priest and mediator between God and man (see de Orat. 10, 15).
All the above-mentioned conceptions of Christ's work were, moreover, worked out by Origen in
such a way that his humanity and divinity are necessary inferences from them. In this case
also he is characterised by the same mode of thought as Irenæus. Finally, let us remember that
Origen adhered as strongly as ever to the proof from prophecy, and that he also, in not a few
instances, regarded the phrase, "it is written", as a sufficient court of appeal (see, for
example, c. Cels. II. 37). Yet, on the other hand, behind all this he has a method of viewing
things which considerably weakens the significance of miracles and prophecies. In general it
must be said that Origen helped to drag into the Church a great many ancient (heathen) ideas
about expiation and redemption, inasmuch as he everywhere found some Bible passage or other
with which he associated them. While he rejected polytheism and gave little countenance to
people who declared: [Greek: eusebesteroi esmen kai Theon kai ta agalmata sebontes] (Clemens
Rom., Hom. XI. 12), he had for all that a principal share in introducing the apparatus of polytheism
into the Church (see also the way in which he strengthened angel and hero worship).]

[Footnote 790: See above, p. 342. note 1, on the idea that Christ, the Crucified One, is of
no importance to the perfect. Only the teacher is of account in this case. To Clement and Origen,
however, teacher and mystagogue are as closely connected as they are to most Gnostics. Christianity
is [Greek: mathêsis] and [Greek: mystagôgia] and it is the one because it is the other. But
in all stages Christianity has ultimately the same object, namely, to effect a reconciliation
with God, and deify man. See c. Cels. III. 28: [Greek: Alla gar kai tên katabasan eis anthrôpinên
physin kai eis anthrôpinas peristaseis dynamin, kai analabousan psychên kai sôma anthrôpinon,
heôrôn ek tou pisteuesthai meta tôn theioterôn symballomenên eis sôtêrian tois pisteuousin
orôsin, ap' ekeinou êrxato theia kai anthrôpinê sunuphainesthai physis en ê anthrôpinê tê pros
to theioteron koinônia genêtai theia ouk en monô tô Iêsou, alla kai pasi tois meta too pisteuein
analambanousi bion, hon Iêsous edidaxena].]

[Footnote 791: From this also we can very clearly understand Origen's aversion to the early
Christian eschatology. In his view the demons are already overcome by the work of Christ. We
need only point out that this conception must have exercised a most important influence on
his frame of mind and on politics.]

[Footnote 792: Clement still advocated docetic views without reservation. Photius (Biblioth.
109) reproached him with these ([Greek: mê sarkôthênai ton logon alla doxai]), and they may
be proved from the Adumbrat, p. 87 (ed Zahn): "fertur in traditionibus--namely, in the Acta
of Lucius--quoniam Iohannes ipsum corpus (Christi), quod erat extrinsecus, tangens manum suam
in profunda misisse et duritiam carnis nullo modo reluctatam esse, sed locum manui præbuisse
discipuli," and likewise from Strom. VI. 9. 71 and III. 7. 59. Clement's repudiation of the
Docetists in VII. 17. 108 does not affect the case, and the fact that he here and there plainly
called Jesus a man, and spoke of his flesh (Pæd. II. 2. 32: Protrept. X. 110) matters just
as little. This teacher simply continued to follow the old undisguised Docetism which only
admitted the apparent reality of Christ's body. Clement expressly declared that Jesus knew
neither pain, nor sorrow, nor emotions, and only took food in order to refute the Docetists
(Strom. VI. 9. 71). As compared with this, Docetism in Origen's case appears throughout in
a weakened form; see Bigg, p. 191.]

[Footnote 793: See the full exposition in Thomasius, Origenes, p. 203 ff. The principal passages
referring to the soul of Jesus are de princip. II. 6: IV. 31; c. Cels. II. 9. 20-25. Socrates
(H. E. III. 7) says that the conviction as to Jesus having a human soul was founded on a [Greek:
mysticê paradosis] of the Church, and was not first broached by Origen. The special problem
of conceiving Christ as a real [Greek: theanthrôpos] in contradistinction to all the men who
only possess the presence of the Logos within them in proportion to their merits, was precisely
formulated by Origen on many occasions. See [Greek: peri archôn] IV. 29 sq. The full divine
nature existed in Christ and yet, as before, the Logos operated wherever he wished (l.c., 30):
"non ita sentiendum est, quod omnis divinitatis eius maiestas intra brevissimi corporis claustra
conclusa est, ita ut omne verbum dei et sapientia eius ac substantialis veritas ac vita vel
a patre divulsa sit vel intra corporis eius coercita et conscripta brevitatem nec usquam præterea
putetur operata; sed inter utrumque cauta pietatis debet esse confessio, ut neque aliquid divinitatis
in Christo defuisse credatur et nulla penitus a paterna substantia, quæ ubique est, facta putetur
esse divisio." On the perfect ethical union of Jesus' soul with the Logos see [Greek: peri
archôn] II. 6. 3: "anima Iesu ab initio creaturæ et deinceps inseparabiliter ei atque indissociabiliter
inhærens et tota totum recipiens atque in eius lucem splendoremque ipsa cedens facta est cum
ipso principaliter unus spiritus;" II. 6. 5: "anima Christi ita elegit diligere iustitiam,
ut pro immensitate dilectionis inconvertibiliter ei atque inseparabiliter inhæreret, ita ut
propositi firmitas et affectus immensitas et dilectionis inexstinguibilis calor omnem sensum
conversionis atque immutationis abscinderet, et quod in arbitrio erat positum, longi usus affectu
iam versum sit in naturam." The sinlessness of this soul thus became transformed from a fact
into a necessity, and the real God-man arose, in whom divinity and humanity are no longer separated.
The latter lies in the former as iron in the fire II. 6. 6. As the metal capax est frigoris
et caloris so the soul is capable of deification. "Omne quod agit, quod sentit, quod intelligit,
deus est," "nec convertibilis aut mutabilis dici potest" (l.c.). "Dilectionis merito anima
Christi cum verbo dei Christus efficitur." (II. 6. 4). [Greek: Tis mallon tês Iêsou psychês
ê kan paraplêsiôs kekollêtai tô kyriô; hoper ei houtôs echei ouk eisi duo hê psychê tou Iêsou
pros ton pasês ktiseôs prôtotokon Theon logon] (c. Cels. VI. 47). The metaphysical foundation
of the union is set forth in [Greek: peri archôn] II. 6. 2: "Substantia animæ inter deum carnemque
mediante--non enim possibile erat dei naturam corpori sine mediatore miscere--nascitur deus
homo, illa substantia media exsistente, cui utique contra naturam non erat corpus assumere.
Sed neque rursus anima illa, utpote substantia rationabilis, contra naturam habuit, capere
deum." Even during his historical life the body of Christ was ever more and more glorified,
acquired therefore wonderful powers, and appeared differently to men according to their several
capacities (that is a Valentinian idea, see Exc. ex Theod. 7); cf. c. Cels. I. 32-38: II. 23,
64: IV. 15 sq.: V. 8, 9, 23. All this is summarised in III. 41: "[Greek: On men nomizomen kai
pepeismetha archêthen einai Theon kai huion Theou, outos ho autologos esti kai hê autosophia
kai hê autoalêtheia to de thnêton autou sôma kai tên anthrôpinên en autô psychên tê pros ekeinon
ou monon koinônia, alla kai henôsei kai anakrasei, ta megista phamen proseilêphenai kai tês
ekeinou thetêtos kekoinônêkota eis Theon metabebêkenai]." Origen then continues and appeals
to the philosophical doctrine that matter has no qualities and can assume all the qualities
which the Creator wishes to give it. Then follows the conclusion: [Greek: ei hugiê ta toiauta,
ti thaumaston, tên poiotêta tou thnêtou kata ton Iêsoun sômatos pronoia Theou boulêthentos
metabalein eis aitherion kai theian poiotêta]; The man is now the same as the Logos. See in
Joh. XXXII. 17, Lomm. II., p. 461 sq.; Hom. in Jerem. XV. 6, Lomm. XV., p. 288: [Greek: ei
kai ên anthrôpos, alla nun oudamôs estin anthrôpos].]

[Footnote 794: In c. Cels. III. 28, Origen spoke of an intermingling of the divine and human
natures, commencing in Christ (see page 368, note 1). See I. 66 fin.; IV. 15, where any [Greek:
allattesthai kai metaplattesthai] of the Logos is decidedly rejected; for the Logos does not
suffer at all. In Origen's case we may speak of a communicatio idiomatum (see Bigg, p. 190 f.).]

[Footnote 795: In opposition to Redepenning.]

[Footnote 796: This idea is found in many passages, especial in Book III, c. 22-43, where Origen,
in opposition to the fables about deification, sought to prove that Christ is divine because
he realised the aim of founding a holy community in humanity. See, besides, the remarkable
statement in III. 38 init.]

[Footnote 797: A very remarkable distinction between the divine and human element in Christ
is found in Clement Pæd. I. 3. 7: [Greek: panta oninêsin ho kurios kai panta ôphelei kai hôs
anthrôpos kai hôs Theos, ta men hamartêmata hôs Theos aphieis, eis de to mê examartanein paidagôgôn
hôs anthrôpos].]

[Footnote 798: "Fides in nobis; mensura fidei causa accipiendarum gratiarum" is the fundamental
idea of Clement and Origen (as of Justin); "voluntas humana præcedit". In Ezech. hom. I. c.
II: "In tua potestate positum est, ut sis palea vel frumentum". But all growth in faith must
depend on divine help. See Orig. in Matth. series 69, Lomm. IV., p. 372: "Fidem habenti, quæ
est ex nobis, dabitur gratia fidei quæ est per spiritum fidei, et abundabit; et quidquid habuerit
quis ex naturali creatione, cum exercuerit illud, accipit id ipsum et ex gratia dei, ut abundet
et firmior sit in eo ipso quod habet"; in Rom. IV. 5, Lomm. VI., p. 258 sq.; in Rom. IX. 3,
Lomm VII., p. 300 sq. The fundamental idea remains: [Greek: ho Theos hêmas ex hêmôn autôn bouletai
sôzesthai.]]

[Footnote 799: This is frequent in Clement; see Orig. c. Cels. VII. 46.]

[Footnote 800: See Clem, Strom. V. I. 7: [Greek: chariti sôzometha, ouk aneu mentoi tôn kalôn
ergôn.]. VII. 7. 48: V. 12. 82, 13. 83: [Greek: eite to en hêmin autexousiou eis gnôsin aphikomenon
tagathou skirta te kai pêda huper ta eskammena, plên ou charitos aneu tês exairetou pteroutai
te kai anistatai kai anô tôn huperkeimenôn airetai hê psychê]; The amalgamation of freedom
and grace. Quis cliv. salv. 21. Orig. [Greek: peri archôn.] III. 2. 2: In bonis rebus humanum
propositum solum per se ipsum imperfectum est ad consummationem boni, adiutorio namque divino
ad perfecta quæque peracitur. III. 2. 5, I. 18; Selecta in Ps. 4, Lomm. XI., p. 450: [Greek:
to tou logikou agathon mikton estin ek te tês proaireseôs autou kai tês sumpneousês theias
dunameôs tô ta allista proelomenô]. The support of grace is invariably conceived as enlightenment;
but this enlightenment enables it to act on the whole life. For a more detailed account see
Landerer in the Jahrbucher fur deutsche Theologie, Vol. II, Part 3, p. 500 ff., and Worter,
Die christliche Lehre von Gnade und Freiheit bis auf Augustin, 1860.]

[Footnote 801: This goal was much more clearly described by Clement than by Origen; but it
was the latter who, in his commentary on the Song of Solomon, gave currency to the image of
the soul as the bride of the Logos. Bigg (p. 188 f.): "Origen, the first pioneer in so many
fields of Christian thought, the father in one of his many aspects of the English Latitudinarians,
became also the spiritual ancestor of Bernard, the Victorines, and the author of the 'De imitatione,'
of Tauler and Molinos and Madame de Guyon."]

[Footnote 803: See e.g., Clem. Quis dives salv. 37 and especially Pædag. I. 6. 25-32; Orig.
de orat. 22 sq.--the interpretation of the Lord's Prayer. This exegesis begins with the words:
"It would be worth while to examine more carefully whether the so-called Old Testament anywhere
contains a prayer in which God is called Father by anyone; for till now we have found none
in spite of all our seeking ... Constant and unchangeable sonship is first given in the new
covenant."]

[Footnote 806: See [Greek: peri archôn] II. 10. 1-3. Origen wrote a treatise on the resurrection,
which, however, has not come down to us, because it was very soon accounted heretical. We see
from c. Cels V. 14-24 the difficulties he felt about the Church doctrine of the resurrection
of the flesh.]
