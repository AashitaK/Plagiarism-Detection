CONFESSIONS AND CRITICISMS.

CHAPTER I.

A PRELIMINARY CONFESSION.

In 1869, when I was about twenty-three years old, I sent a couple of sonnets to the revived
Putnam's Magazine. At that period I had no intention of becoming a professional writer: I was
studying civil engineering at the Polytechnic School in Dresden, Saxony. Years before, I had
received parental warnings--unnecessary, as I thought--against writing for a living. During
the next two years, however, when I was acting as hydrographic engineer in the New York Dock
Department, I amused myself by writing a short story, called "Love and Counter-Love," which
was published in Harper's Weekly, and for which I was paid fifty dollars. "If fifty dollars
can be so easily earned," I thought, "why not go on adding to my income in this way from time
to time?" I was aided and abetted in the idea by the late Robert Carter, editor of Appletons'
Journal; and the latter periodical and Harper's Magazine had the burden, and I the benefit,
of the result. When, in 1872, I was abruptly relieved from my duties in the Dock Department,
I had the alternative of either taking my family down to Central America to watch me dig a
canal, or of attempting to live by my pen. I bought twelve reams of large letter-paper, and
began my first work,--"Bressant." I finished it in three weeks; but prudent counsellors advised
me that it was too immoral to publish, except in French: so I recast it, as the phrase is,
and, in its chastened state, sent it through the post to a Boston publisher. It was lost on
the way, and has not yet been found. I was rather pleased than otherwise at this catastrophe;
for I had in those days a strange delight in rewriting my productions: it was, perhaps, a more
sensible practice than to print them. Accordingly, I rewrote and enlarged "Bressant" in Dresden
(whither I returned with my family in 1872); but--immorality aside--I think the first version
was the best of the three. On my way to Germany I passed through London, and there made the
acquaintance of Henry S. King, the publisher, a charming but imprudent man, for he paid me
one hundred pounds for the English copyright of my novel: and the moderate edition he printed
is, I believe, still unexhausted. The book was received in a kindly manner by the press; but
both in this country and in England some surprise and indignation were expressed that the son
of his father should presume to be a novelist. This sentiment, whatever its bearing upon me,
has undoubtedly been of service to my critics: it gives them something to write about. A disquisition
upon the mantle of Nathaniel Hawthorne, and an analysis of the differences and similarities
between him and his successor, generally fill so much of a notice as to enable the reviewer
to dismiss the book itself very briefly. I often used to wish, when, years afterwards, I was
myself a reviewer for the London Spectator, that I could light upon some son of his father
who might similarly lighten my labors. Meanwhile, I was agreeably astonished at what I chose
to consider the success of "Bressant," and set to work to surpass it in another romance, called
(for some reason I have forgotten) "Idolatry." This unknown book was actually rewritten, in
whole or in part, no less than seven times. Non sum qualis eram. For seven or eight years past
I have seldom rewritten one of the many pages which circumstances have compelled me to inflict
upon the world. But the discipline of "Idolatry" probably taught me how to clothe an idea in words.

By the time "Idolatry" was published, the year 1874 had come, and I was living in London. From
my note-books and recollections I compiled a series of papers on life in Dresden, under the
general title of "Saxon Studies." Alexander Strahan, then editor of the Contemporary Review,
printed them in that periodical as fast as I wrote them, and they were reproduced in certain
eclectic magazines in this country,--until I asserted my American copyright. Their publication
in book form was followed by the collapse of both the English and the American firm engaging
in that enterprise. I draw no deductions from that fact: I simply state it. The circulation
of the "Studies" was naturally small; but one copy fell into the hands of a Dresden critic,
and the manner in which he wrote of it and its author repaid me for the labor of composition
and satisfied me that I had not done amiss.

After "Saxon Studies" I began another novel, "Garth," instalments of which appeared from month
to month in Harper's Magazine. When it had run for a year or more, with no signs of abatement,
the publishers felt obliged to intimate that unless I put an end to their misery they would.
Accordingly, I promptly gave Garth his quietus. The truth is, I was tired of him myself. With
all his qualities and virtues, he could not help being a prig. He found some friends, however,
and still shows signs of vitality. I wrote no other novel for nearly two years, but contributed
some sketches of English life to Appletons' Journal, and produced a couple of novelettes,--"Mrs.
Gainsborough's Diamonds" and "Archibald Malmaison,"-- which, by reason of their light draught,
went rather farther than usual. Other short tales, which I hardly care to recall, belong to
this period. I had already ceased to take pleasure in writing for its own sake,--partly, no
doubt, because I was obliged to write for the sake of something else. Only those who have no
reverence for literature should venture to meddle with the making of it,--unless, at all events,
they can supply the demands of the butcher and baker from an independent source.

In 1879, "Sebastian Strome" was published as a serial in All the Year Round. Charley Dickens,
the son of the great novelist, and editor of the magazine, used to say to me while the story
was in progress, "Keep that red-haired girl up to the mark, and the story will do." I took
a fancy to Mary Dene myself. But I uniformly prefer my heroines to my heroes; perhaps because
I invent the former out of whole cloth, whereas the latter are often formed of shreds and patches
of men I have met. And I never raised a character to the position of hero without recognizing
in him, before I had done with him, an egregious ass. Differ as they may in other respects,
they are all brethren in that; and yet I am by no means disposed to take a Carlylese view of
my actual fellow-creatures.

I did some hard work at this time: I remember once writing for twenty-six consecutive hours
without pausing or rising from my chair; and when, lately, I re-read the story then produced,
it seemed quite as good as the average of my work in that kind. I hasten to add that it has
never been printed in this country: for that matter, not more than half my short tales have
found an American publisher. "Archibald Malmaison" was offered seven years ago to all the leading
publishers in New York and Boston, and was promptly refused by all. Since its recent appearance
here, however, it has had a circulation larger perhaps than that of all my other stories combined.
But that is one of the accidents that neither author nor publisher can foresee. It was the
horror of "Archibald Malmaison," not any literary merit, that gave it vogue,--its horror, its
strangeness, and its brevity.

On Guy Fawkes's day, 1880, I began "Fortune's Fool,"--or "Luck," as it was first called,--and
wrote the first ten of the twelve numbers in three months. I used to sit down to my table at
eight o'clock in the evening and write till sunrise. But the two remaining instalments were
not written and published until 1883, and this delay and its circumstances spoiled the book.
In the interval between beginning and finishing it another long novel--"Dust"--was written
and published. I returned to America in 1882, after an absence in Europe far longer than I
had anticipated or desired. I trust I may never leave my native land again for any other on
this planet.

"Beatrix Randolph," "Noble Blood," and "Love--or a Name," are the novels which I have written
since my return; and I also published a biography, "Nathaniel Hawthorne and his Wife." I cannot
conscientiously say that I have found the literary profession--in and for itself--entirely
agreeable. Almost everything that I have written has been written from necessity; and there
is very little of it that I shall not be glad to see forgotten. The true rewards of literature,
for men of limited calibre, are the incidental ones,--the valuable friendships and the charming
associations which it brings about. For the sake of these I would willingly endure again many
passages of a life that has not been all roses; not that I would appear to belittle my own
work: it does not need it. But the present generation (in America at least) does not strike
me as containing much literary genius. The number of undersized persons is large and active,
and we hardly believe in the possibility of heroic stature. I cannot sufficiently admire the
pains we are at to make our work--embodying the aims it does-- immaculate in form. Form without
idea is nothing, and we have no ideas. If one of us were to get an idea, it would create its
own form, as easily as does a flower or a planet. I think we take ourselves too seriously:
our posterity will not be nearly so grave over us. For my part, I do not write better than
I do, because I have no ideas worth better clothes than they can pick up for themselves. "Whatever
is worth doing at all is worth doing with your best pains," is a saying which has injured our
literature more than any other single thing. How many a lumber-closet since the world began
has been filled by the results of this purblind and delusive theory! But this is not autobiographical,--save
that to have written it shows how little prudence my life has taught me.

       *       *       *       *       *

I remember wondering, in 1871, how anybody could write novels. I had produced two or three
short stories; but to expand such a thing until it should cover two or three hundred pages
seemed an enterprise far beyond my capacity. Since then, I have accomplished the feat only
too often; but I doubt whether I have a much clearer idea than before of the way it is done;
and I am certain of never having done it twice in the same way. The manner in which the plant
arrives at maturity varies according to the circumstances in which the seed is planted and
cultivated; and the cultivator, in this instance at least, is content to adapt his action to
whatever conditions happen to exist.

While, therefore, it might be easy to formulate a cut-and-dried method of procedure, which
should be calculated to produce the best results by the most efficient means, no such formula
would truly represent the present writer's actual practice. If I ever attempted to map out
my successive steps beforehand, I never adhered to the forecast or reached the anticipated
goal. The characters develop unexpected traits, and these traits become the parents of incidents
that had not been contemplated. The characters themselves, on the other hand, cannot be kept
to any preconceived characteristics; they are, in their turn, modified by the exigencies of
the plot.

In two or three cases I have tried to make portraits of real persons whom I have known; but
these persons have always been more lifeless than the others, and most lifeless in precisely
those features that most nearly reproduced life. The best results in this direction are realized
by those characters that come to their birth simultaneously with the general scheme of the
proposed events; though I remember that one of the most lifelike of my personages (Madge, in
the novel "Garth") was not even thought of until the story of which she is the heroine had
been for some time under consideration.

Speaking generally, I should suppose that the best novels are apt to be those that have been
longest in the novelist's mind before being committed to paper; and the best materials to use,
in the way of character and scenery, are those that were studied not less than seven or eight
years previous to their reproduction. Thereby is attained that quality in a story known as
atmosphere or tone, perhaps the most valuable and telling quality of all. Occasionally, however,
in the rare case of a story that suddenly seizes upon the writer's imagination and despotically
"possesses" him, the atmosphere is created by the very strength of the "possession." In the
former instance, the writer is thoroughly master of his subject; in the latter, the subject
thoroughly masters him; and both amount essentially to the same thing, harmony between subject
and writer.

With respect to style, there is little to be said. Without a good style, no writer can do much;
but it is impossible really to create a good style. A writer's style was born at the same time
and under the same conditions that he himself was. The only rule that can be given him is,
to say what he has to say in the clearest and most direct way, using the most fitting and expressive
words. But often, of course, this advice is like that of the doctor who counsels his patient
to free his mind from all care and worry, to live luxuriously on the fat of the land, and to
make a voyage round the world in a private yacht. The patient has not the means of following
the prescription. A writer may improve a native talent for style; but the talent itself he
must either have by nature, or forever go without. And the style that rises to the height of
genius is like the Phoenix; there is hardly ever more than one example of it in an age.

Upon the whole, I conceive that the best way of telling how a novel may be written will be
to trace the steps by which some one novel of mine came into existence, and let the reader
draw his own conclusions from the record. For this purpose I will select one of the longest
of my productions, "Fortune's Fool."

It is so long that, rather than be compelled to read it over again, I would write another of
equal length; though I hasten to add that neither contingency is in the least probable. In
very few men is found the power of sustained conception necessary to the successful composition
of so prolix a tale; and certainly I have never betrayed the ownership of such a qualification.
The tale, nevertheless, is an irrevocable fact; and my present business it is to be its biographer.

When, in the winter of 1879, the opportunity came to write it, the central idea of it had been
for over a year cooking in my mind. It was originally derived from a dream. I saw a man who,
upon some occasion, caught a glimpse of a woman's face. This face was, in his memory, the ideal
of beauty, purity, and goodness. Through many years and vicissitudes he sought it; it was his
religion, a human incarnation of divine qualities.

At certain momentous epochs of his career, he had glimpses of it again; and the effect was
always to turn him away from the wrong path and into the right. At last, near the end of his
life, he has, for the first time, an opportunity of speaking to this mortal angel and knowing
her; and then he discovers that she is mortal indeed, and chargeable with the worst frailties
of mortality. The moral was that any substitute for a purely spiritual religion is fatal, and,
sooner or later, reveals its rottenness.

This seemed good enough for a beginning; but, when I woke up, I was not long in perceiving
that it would require various modifications before being suitable for a novel; and the first
modifications must be in the way of rendering the plot plausible. What sort of a man, for example,
must the hero be to fall into and remain in such an error regarding the character of the heroine?
He must, I concluded, be a person of great simplicity and honesty of character, with a strong
tinge of ideality and imagination, and with little or no education.

These considerations indicated a person destitute of known parentage, and growing up more or
less apart from civilization, but possessing by nature an artistic or poetic temperament. Fore-glimpses
of the further development of the story led me to make him the child of a wealthy English nobleman,
but born in a remote New England village. His artistic proclivities must be inherited from
his father, who was, therefore, endowed with a talent for amateur sketching in oils; which
talent, again, led him, during his minority, to travel on the continent for purposes of artistic
study. While in Paris, this man, Floyd Vivian, meets a young Frenchwoman, whom he secretly
marries, and with whom he elopes to America. Then Vivian receives news of his father's death,
compelling him to return to England; and he leaves his wife behind him.

A child (Jack, the hero of the story) is born during his absence, and the mother dies. Vivian,
now Lord Castleman, finds reason to believe that his wife is dead, but knows nothing of the
boy; and he marries again. The boy, therefore, is left to grow up in the Maine woods, ignorant
of his parentage, but with one or two chances of finding it out hereafter. So far, so good.

But now it was necessary to invent a heroine for this hero. In order to make the construction
compact, I made her Jack's cousin, the daughter, of Lord Vivian's younger brother, who came
into being for that purpose. This brother (Murdock) was a black sheep; and his daughter, Madeleine,
was adopted by Lord Vivian, because I now perceived that Lord Vivian's conscience was going
to trouble him with regard to his dead wife and her possible child, and that he would make
a pilgrimage to New England to settle his doubts, taking Madeleine with him; intending, if
no child by the first marriage were forthcoming, to make Madeleine his heir; for he had no
issue by his second marriage. This journey would enable Jack and Madeleine to meet as children.
But it was necessary that they should have no suspicion of their cousinship. Consequently,
Lord Vivian, who alone could acquaint them with this fact, must die in the very act of learning
it himself. And what should be the manner of his death?

At first, I thought he should be murdered by his younger brother; but I afterwards hit upon
another plan, that seemed less hackneyed and provided more interesting issues. Murdock should
arrive at the Maine village at the same time as Lord Vivian, and upon the same errand, to get
hold of Lord Vivian's son, of whose existence he had heard, and whom he wished to get out of
the way, in order that his own daughter, Madeleine, might inherit the property. Murdock should
find Jack, and Jack, a mere boy, should kill him, though not, of course, intentionally, or
even consciously (for which purpose the machinery of the Witch's Head was introduced).

With Murdock's death, the papers that he carried, proving Jack's parentage, should disappear,
to be recovered long afterward, when they were needed. Lord Vivian should quietly expire at
the same time, of heart disease (to which he was forthwith made subject), and Madeleine should
be left temporarily to her own devices. Thus was brought about her meeting with Jack in the
cave. It was their first meeting; and Jack must remember her face, so as to recognize her when
they meet, years later, in England. But, as it was beyond belief that the girl's face should
resemble the woman's enough to make such a recognition possible, I devised the miniature portrait
of her mother, which Madeleine gave to Jack for a keepsake, and which was the image of what
Madeleine herself should afterward become.

Something more was needed, however, to complete the situation; and to meet this exigency, I
created M. Jacques Malgre, the grandfather of Jack, who had followed his daughter to America,
in the belief that she had been seduced by Vivian; who had brought up Jack, hating him for
his father's sake, and loving him for his mother's sake; and who dwelt year after year in the
Maine village, hoping some day to wreak his vengeance upon the seducer. But when M. Malgre
and Vivian at last meet, this revenge is balked by the removal of its supposed motive; Vivian
having actually married Malgre's daughter, and being prepared to make Jack heir of Castlemere.
Moral: "'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord, 'I will repay.'"

The groundwork of the story was now sufficiently denned. Madeleine and Jack were born and accounted
for. They had met and made friends with each other without either knowing who the other was;
they were rival claimants for the same property, and would hereafter contend for it; still,
without identifying each other as the little boy and girl that had met by chance in the cave
so long ago. In the meanwhile, there might be personal meetings, in which they should recognize
each other as persons though not by name; and should thus be cementing their friendship as
man and woman, while, as Jack Vivian and Madeleine, they were at open war in the courts of law.

This arrangement would need careful handling to render it plausible; but it could be done.
I am now of opinion, however, that I should have done well to have given up the whole fundamental
idea of the story, as suggested by the dream. The dream had done its office when it had provided
me with characters and materials for a more probable and less abstruse and difficult plot.
All further dependence upon it should then have been relinquished, and the story allowed to
work out its own natural and unforced conclusion. But it is easy to be wise after the event;
and the event, at this time, was still in the future.

As Madeleine was to be the opposite of the sinless, ideal woman that Jack was to imagine her
to be, it was necessary to subject her to some evil influence; and this influence was embodied
in the form of Bryan Sinclair, who, though an afterthought, came to be the most powerful figure
in the story. But, before he would bring himself to bear upon her, she must have reached womanhood;
and I also perceived that Jack must become a man before the action of the story, as between
him and Madeleine, could continue. An interval of ten or fifteen years must therefore occur;
and this was arranged by sending Jack into the western wilderness of California, and fixing
the period as just preceding the date of the California gold fever of '49.

Jack and Bryan were to be rivals for Madeleine; but artistic considerations seemed to require
that they should first meet and become friends much in the same way that Jack and Madeleine
had done. So I sent Bryan to California, and made him the original discoverer of the precious
metal there; brought him and Jack together; and finally sent them to England in each other's
company. Jack, of course, as yet knows nothing of his origin, and appears in London society
merely as a natural genius and a sculptor of wild animals.

By this time, I had begun to make Madeleine's acquaintance, and, in consequence, to doubt the
possibility of her becoming wholly evil, even under the influence of Bryan Sinclair. There
would be a constant struggle between them; she would love him, but would not yield to him,
though her life and happiness would be compromised by his means. He, on the other hand, would
love her, and he would make some effort to be worthy of her; but his other crimes would weigh
him down, until, at the moment when the battle cost her her life, he should be destroyed by
the incarnation of his own wickedness, in the shape of Tom Berne.

This was not the issue that I had originally designed, and, whether better or worse than that,
did not harmonize with what had gone before. The story lacked wholeness and continuous vitality.
As a work of art, it was a failure. But I did not realize this fact until it was too late,
and probably should not have known how to mend matters had it been otherwise. One of the dangers
against which a writer has especially to guard is that of losing his sense of proportion in
the conduct of a story. An episode that has little relative importance may be allowed undue
weight, because it seems interesting intrinsically, or because he has expended special pains
upon it. It is only long afterward, when he has become cool and impartial, if not indifferent
or disgusted, that he can see clearly where the faults of construction lie.

I need not go further into the details of the story. Enough has been said to give a clew to
what might remain to say. I began to write it in the winter of 1879-80, in London; and, in
order to avoid noise and interruption, it was my custom to begin writing at eight in the evening,
and continue at work until six or seven o'clock the next morning. In three months I had written
as far as the 393d page, in the American edition. The remaining seventy pages were not completed,
in their published form, until about three years later, an extraordinary delay, which did not
escape censure at the time, and into the causes of which I will not enter here.

The title of the story also underwent various vicissitudes. The one first chosen was "Happy
Jack"; but that was objected to as suggesting, to an English ear at least, a species of cheap
Jack or rambling peddler. The next title fixed upon was "Luck"; but before this could be copyrighted,
somebody published a story called "Luck, and What Came of It," and thereby invalidated my briefer
version. For several weeks, I was at a loss what to call it; but one evening, at a representation
of "Romeo and Juliet," I heard the exclamation of Romeo, "Oh, I am fortune's fool!" and immediately
appropriated it to my own needs. It suited the book well enough, in more ways than one.

CHAPTER II

NOVELS AND AGNOSTICISM.

The novel of our times is susceptible of many definitions. The American publishers of Railway
libraries think that it is forty or fifty double- column pages of pirated English fiction.
Readers of the "New York Ledger" suppose it to be a romance of angelic virtue at last triumphant
over satanic villany. The aristocracy of culture describe it as a philosophic analysis of human
character and motives, with an agnostic bias on the analyst's part. Schoolboys are under the
impression that it is a tale of Western chivalry and Indian outrage--price, ten cents. Most
of us agree in the belief that it should contain a brace or two of lovers, a suspense, and
a solution.

To investigate the nature of the novel in the abstract would involve going back to the very
origin of things. It would imply the recognition of a certain faculty of the mind, known as
imagination; and of a certain fact in history, called art. Art and imagination are correlatives,--one
implies the other. Together, they may be said to constitute the characteristic badge and vindication
of human nature; imagination is the badge, and art is the vindication. Reason, which gets so
much vulgar glorification, is, after all, a secondary quality. It is posterior to imagination,--it
is one of the means by which imagination seeks to realize its ends. Some animals reason, or
seem to do so: but the most cultivated ape or donkey has not yet composed a sonnet, or a symphony,
or "an arrangement in green and yellow." Man still retains a few prerogatives, although, like
Aesop's stag, which despised the legs that bore it away from the hounds, and extolled the antlers
that entangled it in the thicket,--so man often magnifies those elements of his nature that
least deserve it.

But, before celebrating art and imagination, we should have a clear idea what those handsome
terms mean. In the broadest sense, imagination is the cause of the effect we call progress.
It marks all forms of human effort towards a better state of things. It embraces a perception
of existing shortcomings, and an aspiration towards a loftier ideal. It is, in fact, a truly
divine force in man, reminding him of his heavenly origin, and stimulating him to rise again
to the level whence he fell. For it has glimpses of the divine Image within or behind the material
veil; and its constant impulse is to tear aside the veil and grasp the image. The world, let
us say, is a gross and finite translation of an infinite and perfect Word; and imagination
is the intuition of that perfection, born in the human heart, and destined forever to draw
mankind into closer harmony with it.

In common speech, however, imagination is deprived of this broader significance, and is restricted
to its relations with art. Art is not progress, though progress implies art. It differs from
progress chiefly in disclaiming the practical element. You cannot apply a poem, a picture,
or a strain of music, to material necessities; they are not food, clothing, or shelter. Only
after these physical wants are assuaged, does art supervene. Its sphere is exclusively mental
and moral. But this definition is not adequate; a further distinction is needed. For such things
as mathematics, moral philosophy, and political economy also belong to the mental sphere, and
yet they are not art. But these, though not actually existing on the plane of material necessities,
yet do exist solely in order to relieve such necessities. Unlike beauty, they are not their
own excuse for being. Their embodiment is utilitarian, that of art is aesthetic. Political
economy, for example, shows me how to buy two drinks for the same price I used to pay for one;
while art inspires me to transmute a pewter mug into a Cellini goblet. My physical nature,
perhaps, prefers two drinks to one; but, if my taste be educated, and I be not too thirsty,
I would rather drink once from the Cellini goblet than twice from the mug. Political economy
gravitates towards the material level; art seeks incarnation only in order to stimulate anew
the same spiritual faculties that generated it. Art is the production, by means of appearances,
of the illusion of a loftier reality; and imagination is the faculty which holds that loftier
reality up for imitation.

The disposition of these preliminaries brings us once more in sight of the goal of our pilgrimage.
The novel, despite its name, is no new thing, but an old friend in a modern dress. Ever since
the time of Cadmus,--ever since language began to express thought as well as emotion,--men
have betrayed the impulse to utter in forms of literary art,--in poetry and story,--their conceptions
of the world around them. According to many philologists, poetry was the original form of human
speech. Be that as it may, whatever flows into the mind, from the spectacle of nature and of
mankind, that influx the mind tends instinctively to reproduce, in a shape accordant with its
peculiar bias and genius. And those minds in which imagination is predominant, impart to their
reproductions a balance and beauty which stamp them as art. Art--and literary art especially--is
the only evidence we have that this universal frame of things has relation to our minds, and
is a universe and not a poliverse. Outside revelation, it is our best assurance of an intelligent
purpose in creation.

Novels, then, instead of being (as some persons have supposed) a wilful and corrupt conspiracy
on the part of the evilly disposed, against the peace and prosperity of the realm, may claim
a most ancient and indefeasible right to existence. They, with their ancestors and near relatives,
constitute Literature,--without which the human race would be little better than savages. For
the effect of pure literature upon a receptive mind is something more than can be definitely
stated. Like sunshine upon a landscape, it is a kind of miracle. It demands from its disciple
almost as much as it gives him, and is never revealed save to the disinterested and loving
eye. In our best moments, it touches us most deeply; and when the sentiment of human brotherhood
kindles most warmly within us, we discover in literature an exquisite answering ardor. When
everything that can be, has been said about a true work of art, its finest charm remains,--the
charm derived from a source beyond the conscious reach even of the artist.

The novel, then, must be pure literature; as much so as the poem. But poetry--now that the
day of the broad Homeric epic is past, or temporarily eclipsed--appeals to a taste too exclusive
and abstracted for the demands of modern readers. Its most accommodating metre fails to house
our endless variety of mood and movement; it exacts from the student an exaltation above the
customary level of thought and sentiment greater than he can readily afford. The poet of old
used to clothe in the garb of verse his every observation on life and nature; but to-day he
reserves for it only his most ideal and abstract conceptions. The merit of Cervantes is not
so much that he laughed Spain's chivalry away, as that he heralded the modern novel of character
and manners. It is the latest, most pliable, most catholic solution of the old problem,--how
to unfold man to himself. It improves on the old methods, while missing little of their excellence.
No one can read a great novel without feeling that, from its outwardly prosaic pages, strains
of genuine poetry have ever and anon reached his ears. It does not obtrude itself; it is not
there for him who has not skill to listen for it: but for him who has ears, it is like the
music of a bird, denning itself amidst the innumerable murmurs of the forest.

So, the ideal novel, conforming in every part to the behests of the imagination, should produce,
by means of literary art, the illusion of a loftier reality. This excludes the photographic
method of novel-writing. "That is a false effort in art," says Goethe, towards the close of
his long and splendid career, "which, in giving reality to the appearance, goes so far as to
leave in it nothing but the common, every-day actual." It is neither the actual, nor Chinese
copies of the actual, that we demand of art. Were art merely the purveyor of such things, she
might yield her crown to the camera and the stenographer; and divine imagination would degenerate
into vulgar inventiveness. Imagination is incompatible with inventiveness, or imitation. Imitation
is death, imagination is life. Imitation is servitude, imagination is royalty. He who claims
the name of artist must rise to that vision of a loftier reality--a more true because a more
beautiful world--which only imagination can reveal. A truer world, --for the world of facts
is not and cannot be true. It is barren, incoherent, misleading. But behind every fact there
is a truth: and these truths are enlightening, unifying, creative. Fasten your hold upon them,
and facts will become your servants instead of your tyrants. No charm of detail will be lost,
no homely picturesque circumstance, no touch of human pathos or humor; but all hardness, rigidity,
and finality will disappear, and your story will be not yours alone, but that of every one
who feels and thinks. Spirit gives universality and meaning; but alas! for this new gospel
of the auctioneer's catalogue, and the crackling of thorns under a pot. He who deals with facts
only, deprives his work of gradation and distinction. One fact, considered in itself, has no
less importance than any other; a lump of charcoal is as valuable as a diamond. But that is
the philosophy of brute beasts and Digger Indians. A child, digging on the beach, may shape
a heap of sand into a similitude of Vesuvius; but is it nothing that Vesuvius towers above
the clouds, and overwhelms Pompeii?

In proceeding from the general to the particular,--to the novel as it actually exists in England
and America,--attention will be confined strictly to the contemporary outlook. The new generation
of novelists (by which is intended not those merely living in this age, but those who actively
belong to it) differ in at least one fundamental respect from the later representatives of
the generation preceding them. Thackeray and Dickens did not deliberately concern themselves
about a philosophy of life. With more or less complacency, more or less cynicism, they accepted
the religious and social canons which had grown to be the commonplace of the first half of
this century. They pictured men and women, not as affected by questions, but as affected by
one another. The morality and immorality of their personages were of the old familiar Church-of-England
sort; there was no speculation as to whether what had been supposed to be wrong was really
right, and vice versa. Such speculations, in various forms and degrees of energy, appear in
the world periodically; but the public conscience during the last thirty or forty years had
been gradually making itself comfortable after the disturbances consequent upon the French
Revolution; the theoretical rights of man had been settled for the moment; and interest was
directed no longer to the assertion and support of these rights, but to the social condition
and character which were their outcome. Good people were those who climbed through reverses
and sorrows towards the conventional heaven; bad people were those who, in spite of worldly
and temporary successes and triumphs, gravitated towards the conventional hell. Novels designed
on this basis in so far filled the bill, as the phrase is: their greater or less excellence
depended solely on the veracity with which the aspect, the temperament, and the conduct of
the dramatis personae were reported, and upon the amount of ingenuity wherewith the web of
events and circumstances was woven, and the conclusion reached. Nothing more was expected,
and, in general, little or nothing more was attempted. Little more, certainly, will be found
in the writings of Thackeray or of Balzac, who, it is commonly admitted, approach nearest to
perfection of any novelists of their time. There was nothing genuine or commanding in the metaphysical
dilettanteism of Bulwer: the philosophical speculations of Georges Sand are the least permanently
interesting feature of her writings; and the same might in some measure be affirmed of George
Eliot, whose gloomy wisdom finally confesses its inability to do more than advise us rather
to bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of. As to Nathaniel Hawthorne,
he cannot properly be instanced in this connection; for he analyzed chiefly those parts of
human nature which remain substantially unaltered in the face of whatever changes of opinion,
civilization, and religion. The truth that he brings to light is not the sensational fact of
a fashion or a period, but a verity of the human heart, which may foretell, but can never be
affected by, anything which that heart may conceive. In other words, Hawthorne belonged neither
to this nor to any other generation of writers further than that his productions may be used
as a test of the inner veracity of all the rest.

But of late years a new order of things has been coming into vogue, and the new novelists have
been among the first to reflect it; and of these the Americans have shown themselves among
the most susceptible. Science, or the investigation of the phenomena of existence (in opposition
to philosophy, the investigation of the phenomena of being), has proved nature to be so orderly
and self-sufficient, and inquiry as to the origin of the primordial atom so unproductive and
quixotic, as to make it convenient and indeed reasonable to accept nature as a self-existing
fact, and to let all the rest--if rest there be--go. From this point of view, God and a future
life retire into the background; not as finally disproved,--because denial, like affirmation,
must, in order to be final, be logically supported; and spirit is, if not illogical, at any
rate outside the domain of logic,--but as being a hopelessly vague and untrustworthy hypothesis.
The Bible is a human book; Christ was a gentleman, related to the Buddha and Plato families;
Joseph was an ill- used man; death, so far as we have any reason to believe, is annihilation
of personal existence; life is--the predicament of the body previous to death; morality is
the enlightened selfishness of the greatest number; civilization is the compromises men make
with one another in order to get the most they can out of the world; wisdom is acknowledgment
of these propositions; folly is to hanker after what may lie beyond the sphere of sense. The
supporter of these doctrines by no means permits himself to be regarded as a rampant and dogmatic
atheist; he is simply the modest and humble doubter of what he cannot prove. He even recognizes
the persistence of the religious instinct in man, and caters to it by a new religion suited
to the times--the Religion of Humanity. Thus he is secure at all points: for if the religion
of the Bible turn out to be true, his disappointment will be an agreeable one; and if it turns
out false, he will not be disappointed at all. He is an agnostic--a person bound to be complacent
whatever happens. He may indulge a gentle regret, a musing sadness, a smiling pensiveness;
but he will never refuse a comfortable dinner, and always wear something soft next his skin,
nor can he altogether avoid the consciousness of his intellectual superiority.

Agnosticism, which reaches forward into nihilism on one side, and extends back into liberal
Christianity on the other, marks, at all events, a definite turning-point from what has been
to what is to come. The human mind, in the course of its long journey, is passing through a
dark place, and is, as it were, whistling to keep up its courage. It is a period of doubt:
what it will result in remains to be seen; but analogy leads us to infer that this doubt, like
all others, will be succeeded by a comparatively definite belief in something--no matter what.
It is a transient state--the interval between one creed and another. The agnostic no longer
holds to what is behind him, nor knows what lies before, so he contents himself with feeling
the ground beneath his feet. That, at least, though the heavens fall, is likely to remain;
meanwhile, let the heavens take care of themselves. It may be the part of valor to champion
divine revelation, but the better part of valor is discretion, and if divine revelation prove
true, discretion will be none the worse off. On the other hand, to champion a myth is to make
one's self ridiculous, and of being ridiculous the agnostic has a consuming fear. From the
superhuman disinterestedness of the theory of the Religion of Humanity, before which angels
might quail, he flinches not, but when it comes to the risk of being laughed at by certain
sagacious persons he confesses that bravery has its limits. He dares do all that may become
an agnostic,--who dares do more is none.

But, however open to criticism this phase of thought may be, it is a genuine phase, and the
proof is the alarm and the shifts that it has brought about in the opposite camp. "Established"
religion finds the foundation of her establishment undermined, and, like the lady in Hamlet's
play, she doth protest too much. In another place, all manner of odd superstitions and quasi-miracles
are cropping up and gaining credence, as if, since the immortality of the soul cannot be proved
by logic, it should be smuggled into belief by fraud and violence--that is, by the testimony
of the bodily senses themselves. Taking a comprehensive view of the whole field, therefore,
it seems to be divided between discreet and supercilious skepticism on one side, and, on the
other, the clamorous jugglery of charlatanism. The case is not really so bad as that: nihilists
are not discreet and even the Bishop of Rome is not necessarily a charlatan. Nevertheless,
the outlook may fairly be described as confused and the issue uncertain. And--to come without
further preface to the subject of this paper--it is with this material that the modern novelist,
so far as he is a modern and not a future novelist, or a novelist temporis acti, has to work.
Unless a man have the gift to forecast the years, or, at least, to catch the first ray of the
coming light, he can hardly do better than attend to what is under his nose. He may hesitate
to identify himself with agnosticism, but he can scarcely avoid discussing it, either in itself
or in its effects. He must entertain its problems; and the personages of his story, if they
do not directly advocate or oppose agnostic views, must show in their lives either confirmation
or disproof of agnostic principles. It is impossible, save at the cost of affectation or of
ignorance, to escape from the spirit of the age. It is in the air we breathe, and, whether
we are fully conscious thereof or not, our lives and thoughts must needs be tinctured by it.

Now, art is creative; but Mephistopheles, the spirit that denies, is destructive. A negative
attitude of mind is not favorable for the production of works of art. The best periods of art
have also been periods of spiritual or philosophical convictions. The more a man doubts, the
more he disintegrates and the less he constructs. He has in him no central initial certainty
round which all other matters of knowledge or investigation may group themselves in symmetrical
relation. He may analyze to his heart's content, but must be wary of organizing. If creation
is not of God, if nature is not the expression of the contact between an infinite and a finite
being, then the universe and everything in it are accidents, which might have been otherwise
or might have not been at all; there is no design in them nor purpose, no divine and eternal
significance. This being conceded, what meaning would there be in designing works of art? If
art has not its prototype in creation, if all that we see and do is chance, uninspired by a
controlling and forming intelligence behind or within it, then to construct a work of art would
be to make something arbitrary and grotesque, something unreal and fugitive, something out
of accord with the general sense (or nonsense) of things, something with no further basis or
warrant than is supplied by the maker's idle and irresponsible fancy. But since no man cares
to expend the trained energies of his mind upon the manufacture of toys, it will come to pass
(upon the accidental hypothesis of creation) that artists will become shy of justifying their
own title. They will adopt the scientific method of merely collecting and describing phenomena;
but the phenomena will no longer be arranged as parts or developments of a central controlling
idea, because such an arrangement would no longer seem to be founded on the truth: the gratification
which it gives to the mind would be deemed illusory, the result of tradition and prejudice;
or, in other words, what is true being found no longer consistent with what we have been accustomed
to call beauty, the latter would cease to be an object of desire, though something widely alien
to it might usurp its name. If beauty be devoid of independent right to be, and definable only
as an attribute of truth, then undoubtedly the cynosure to- day may be the scarecrow of to-morrow,
and vice versa, according to our varying conception of what truth is.

And, as a matter of fact, art already shows the effects of the agnostic influence. Artists
have begun to doubt whether their old conceptions of beauty be not fanciful and silly. They
betray a tendency to eschew the loftier flights of the imagination, and confine themselves
to what they call facts. Critics deprecate idealism as something fit only for children, and
extol the courage of seeing and representing things as they are. Sculpture is either a stern
student of modern trousers and coat-tails or a vapid imitator of classic prototypes. Painters
try all manner of experiments, and shrink from painting beneath the surface of their canvas.
Much of recent effort in the different branches of art comes to us in the form of "studies,"
but the complete work still delays to be born. We would not so much mind having our old idols
and criterions done away with were something new and better, or as good, substituted for them.
But apparently nothing definite has yet been decided on. Doubt still reigns, and, once more,
doubt is not creative. One of two things must presently happen. The time will come when we
must stop saying that we do not know whether or not God, and all that God implies, exists,
and affirm definitely and finally either that he does not exist or that he does. That settled,
we shall soon see what will become of art. If there is a God, he will be understood and worshipped,
not superstitiously and literally as heretofore, but in a new and enlightened spirit; and an
art will arise commensurate with this new and loftier revelation. If there is no God, it is
difficult to see how art can have the face to show herself any more. There is no place for
her in the Religion of Humanity; to be true and living she can be nothing which it has thus
far entered into the heart of man to call beautiful; and she could only serve to remind us
of certain vague longings and aspirations now proved to be as false as they were vain. Art
is not an orchid: it cannot grow in the air. Unless its root can be traced as deep down as
Yggdrasil, it will wither and vanish, and be forgotten as it ought to be; and as for the cowslip
by the river's brim, a yellow cowslip it shall be, and nothing more; and the light that never
was on sea or land shall be permanently extinguished, in the interests of common sense and
economy, and (what is least inviting of all to the unregenerate mind) we shall speedily get
rid of the notion that we have lost anything worth preserving.

This, however, is only what may be, and our concern at present is with things as they are.
It has been observed that American writers have shown themselves more susceptible of the new
influences than most others, partly no doubt from a natural sensitiveness of organization,
but in some measure also because there are with us no ruts and fetters of old tradition from
which we must emancipate ourselves before adopting anything new. We have no past, in the European
sense, and so are ready for whatever the present or the future may have to suggest. Nevertheless,
the novelist who, in a larger degree than any other, seems to be the literary parent of our
own best men of fiction, is himself not an American, nor even an Englishman, but a Russian--Turguenieff.
His series of extraordinary novels, translated into English and French, is altogether the most
important fact in the literature of fiction of the last twelve years. To read his books you
would scarcely imagine that their author could have had any knowledge of the work of his predecessors
in the same field. Originality is a term indiscriminately applied, and generally of trifling
significance, but so far as any writer may be original, Turguenieff is so. He is no less original
in the general scheme and treatment of his stories than in their details. Whatever he produces
has the air of being the outcome of his personal experience and observation. He even describes
his characters, their aspect, features, and ruling traits, in a novel and memorable manner.
He seizes on them from a new point of vantage, and uses scarcely any of the hackneyed and conventional
devices for bringing his portraits before our minds; yet no writer, not even Carlyle, has been
more vivid, graphic, and illuminating than he. Here are eyes that owe nothing to other eyes,
but examine and record for themselves. Having once taken up a character he never loses his
grasp on it: on the contrary, he masters it more and more, and only lets go of it when the
last recesses of its organism have been explored. In the quality and conduct of his plots he
is equally unprecedented. His scenes are modern, and embody characteristic events and problems
in the recent history of Russia. There is in their arrangement no attempt at symmetry, nor
poetic justice. Temperament and circumstances are made to rule, and against their merciless
fiat no appeal is allowed. Evil does evil to the end; weakness never gathers strength; even
goodness never varies from its level: it suffers, but is not corrupted; it is the goodness
of instinct, not of struggle and aspiration; it happens to belong to this or that person, just
as his hair happens to be black or brown. Everything in the surroundings and the action is
to the last degree matter-of-fact, commonplace, inevitable; there are no picturesque coincidences,
no providential interferences, no desperate victories over fate; the tale, like the world of
the materialist, moves onward from a predetermined beginning to a helpless and tragic close.
And yet few books have been written of deeper and more permanent fascination than these. Their
grim veracity; the creative sympathy and steady dispassionateness of their portrayal of mankind;
their constancy of motive, and their sombre earnestness, have been surpassed by none. This
earnestness is worth dwelling upon for a moment. It bears no likeness to the dogmatism of the
bigot or the fanaticism of the enthusiast. It is the concentration of a broadly gifted masculine
mind, devoting its unstinted energies to depicting certain aspects of society and civilization,
which are powerfully representative of the tendencies of the day. "Here is the unvarnished
fact--give heed to it!" is the unwritten motto. The author avoids betraying, either explicitly
or implicitly, the tendency of his own sympathies; not because he fears to have them known,
but because he holds it to be his office simply to portray, and to leave judgment thereupon
where, in any case, it must ultimately rest--with the world of his readers. He tells us what
is; it is for us to consider whether it also must be and shall be. Turguenieff is an artist
by nature, yet his books are not intentionally works of art; they are fragments of history,
differing from real life only in presenting such persons and events as are commandingly and
exhaustively typical, and excluding all others. This faculty of selection is one of the highest
artistic faculties, and it appears as much in the minor as in the major features of the narrative.
It indicates that Turguenieff might, if he chose, produce a story as faultlessly symmetrical
as was ever framed. Why, then, does he not so choose? The reason can only be that he deems
the truth-seeming of his narrative would thereby be impaired. "He is only telling a story,"
the reader would say, "and he shapes the events and persons so as to fit the plot." But is
this reason reasonable? To those who believe that God has no hand in the ordering of human
affairs, it undoubtedly is reasonable. To those who believe the contrary, however, it appears
as if the story of no human life or complex of lives could be otherwise than a rounded and
perfect work of art--provided only that the spectator takes note, not merely of the superficial
accidents and appearances, but also of the underlying divine purpose and significance. The
absence of this recognition in Turguenieff's novels is the explanation of them: holding the
creed their author does, he could not have written them otherwise; and, on the other hand,
had his creed been different, he very likely would not have written novels at all.

The pioneer, in whatever field of thought or activity, is apt to be also the most distinguished
figure therein. The consciousness of being the first augments the keenness of his impressions,
and a mind that can see and report in advance of others a new order of things may claim a finer
organization than the ordinary. The vitality of nature animates him who has insight to discern
her at first hand, whereas his followers miss the freshness of the morning, because, instead
of discovering, they must be content to illustrate and refine. Those of our writers who betray
Turguenieff's influence are possibly his superiors in finish and culture, but their faculty
of convincing and presenting is less. Their interest in their own work seems less serious than
his; they may entertain us more, but they do not move and magnetize so much. The persons and
events of their stories are conscientiously studied, and are nothing if not natural; but they
lack distinction. In an epitome of life so concise as the longest novel must needs be, to use
any but types is waste of time and space. A typical character is one who combines the traits
or beliefs of a certain class to which he is affiliated--who is, practically, all of them and
himself besides; and, when we know him, there is nothing left worth knowing about the others.
In Shakespeare's Hamlet and Enobarbus, in Fielding's Squire Western, in Walter Scott's Edie
Ochiltree and Meg Merrilies, in Balzac's Pere Goriot and Madame Marneff, in Thackeray's Colonel
Newcome and Becky Sharp, in Turguenieff's Bazarof and Dimitri Roudine, we meet persons who
exhaust for us the groups to which they severally belong. Bazarof, the nihilist, for instance,
reveals to us the motives and influences that have made nihilism, so that we feel that nothing
essential on that score remains to be learnt.

The ability to recognize and select types is a test of a novelist's talent and experience.
It implies energy to rise above the blind walls of one's private circle of acquaintance; the
power to perceive what phases of thought and existence are to be represented as well as who
represents them; the sagacity to analyze the age or the moment and reproduce its dominant features.
The feat is difficult, and, when done, by no means blows its own trumpet. On the contrary,
the reader must open his eyes to be aware of it. He finds the story clear and easy of comprehension;
the characters come home to him familiarly and remain distinctly in his memory; he understands
something which was, till now, vague to him: but he is as likely to ascribe this to an exceptional
lucidity in his own mental condition as to any special merit in the author. Indeed, it often
happens that the author who puts out-of-the-way personages into his stories-- characters that
represent nothing but themselves, or possibly some eccentricity of invention on their author's
part, will gain the latter a reputation for cleverness higher than his fellow's who portrays
mankind in its masses as well as in its details. But the finest imagination is not that which
evolves strange images, but that which explains seeming contradictions, and reveals the unity
within the difference and the harmony beneath the discord.

Were we to compare our fictitious literature, as a whole, with that of England, the balance
must be immeasurably on the English side. Even confining ourselves to to-day, and to the prospect
of to-morrow, it must be conceded that, in settled method, in guiding tradition, in training
and associations both personal and inherited, the average English novelist is better circumstanced
than the American. Nevertheless, the English novelist is not at present writing better novels
than the American. The reason seems to be that he uses no material which has not been in use
for hundreds of years; and to say that such material begins to lose its freshness is not putting
the case too strongly. He has not been able to detach himself from the paralyzing background
of English conventionality. The vein was rich, but it is worn out; and the half-dozen pioneers
had all the luck.

There is no commanding individual imagination in England--nor, to say the truth, does there
seem to be any in America. But we have what they have not--a national imaginative tendency.
There are no fetters upon our fancy; and, however deeply our real estate may be mortgaged,
there is freedom for our ideas. England has not yet appreciated the true inwardness of a favorite
phrase of ours,--a new deal. And yet she is tired to death of her own stale stories; and when,
by chance, any one of her writers happens to chirp out a note a shade different from the prevailing
key, the whole nation pounces down upon him, with a shriek of half-incredulous joy, and buys
him up, at the rate of a million copies a year. Our own best writers are more read in England,
or, at any rate, more talked about, than their native crop; not so much, perhaps, because they
are different as because their difference is felt to be of a significant and typical kind.
It has in it a gleam of the new day. They are realistic; but realism, so far as it involves
a faithful study of nature, is useful. The illusion of a loftier reality, at which we should
aim, must be evolved from adequate knowledge of reality itself. The spontaneous and assured
faith, which is the mainspring of sane imagination, must be preceded by the doubt and rejection
of what is lifeless and insincere. We desire no resurrection of the Ann Radclyffe type of romance:
but the true alternative to this is not such a mixture of the police gazette and the medical
reporter as Emile Zola offers us. So far as Zola is conscientious, let him live; but, in so
far as he is revolting, let him die. Many things in the world seem ugly and purposeless; but
to a deeper intelligence than ours, they are a part of beauty and design. What is ugly and
irrelevant, can never enter, as such, into a work of art; because the artist is bound, by a
sacred obligation, to show us the complete curve only,--never the undeveloped fragments.

But were the firmament of England still illuminated with her Dickenses, her Thackerays, and
her Brontes, I should still hold our state to be fuller of promise than hers. It may be admitted
that almost everything was against our producing anything good in literature. Our men, in the
first place, had to write for nothing; because the publisher, who can steal a readable English
novel, will not pay for an American novel, for the mere patriotic gratification of enabling
its American author to write it. In the second place, they had nothing to write about, for
the national life was too crude and heterogeneous for ordinary artistic purposes. Thirdly,
they had no one to write for: because, although, in one sense, there might be readers enough,
in a higher sense there were scarcely any,--that is to say, there was no organized critical
body of literary opinion, from which an author could confidently look to receive his just meed
of encouragement and praise. Yet, in spite of all this, and not to mention honored names that
have ceased or are ceasing to cast their living weight into the scale, we are contributing
much that is fresh and original, and something, it may be, that is of permanent value, to literature.
We have accepted the situation; and, since no straw has been vouchsafed us to make our bricks
with, we are trying manfully to make them without.

It will not be necessary, however, to call the roll of all the able and popular gentlemen who
are contending in the forlorn hope against disheartening odds; and as for the ladies who have
honored our literature by their contributions, it will perhaps be well to adopt regarding them
a course analogous to that which Napoleon is said to have pursued with the letters sent to
him while in Italy. He left them unread until a certain time had elapsed, and then found that
most of them no longer needed attention. We are thus brought face to face with the two men
with whom every critic of American novelists has to reckon; who represent what is carefullest
and newest in American fiction; and it remains to inquire how far their work has been moulded
by the skeptical or radical spirit of which Turguenieff is the chief exemplar.

The author of "Daisy Miller" had been writing for several years before the bearings of his
course could be confidently calculated. Some of his earlier tales,--as, for example, "The Madonna
of the Future,"--while keeping near reality on one side, are on the other eminently fanciful
and ideal. He seemed to feel the attraction of fairyland, but to lack resolution to swallow
it whole; so, instead of idealizing both persons and plot, as Hawthorne had ventured to do,
he tried to persuade real persons to work out an ideal destiny. But the tact, delicacy, and
reticence with which these attempts were made did not blind him to the essential incongruity;
either realism or idealism had to go, and step by step he dismissed the latter, until at length
Turguenieff's current caught him. By this time, however, his culture had become too wide, and
his independent views too confirmed, to admit of his yielding unconditionally to the great
Russian. Especially his critical familiarity with French literature operated to broaden, if
at the same time to render less trenchant, his method and expression. His characters are drawn
with fastidious care, and closely follow the tones and fashions of real life. Each utterance
is so exactly like what it ought to be that the reader feels the same sort of pleased surprise
as is afforded by a phonograph which repeats, with all the accidental pauses and inflections,
the speech spoken into it. Yet the words come through a medium; they are not quite spontaneous;
these figures have not the sad, human inevitableness of Turguenieff's people. The reason seems
to be (leaving the difference between the genius of the two writers out of account) that the
American, unlike the Russian, recognizes no tragic importance in the situation. To the latter,
the vision of life is so ominous that his voice waxes sonorous and terrible; his eyes, made
keen by foreboding, see the leading elements of the conflict, and them only; he is no idle
singer of an empty day, but he speaks because speech springs out of him. To his mind, the foundations
of human welfare are in jeopardy, and it is full time to decide what means may avert the danger.
But the American does not think any cataclysm is impending, or if any there be, nobody can
help it. The subjects that best repay attention are the minor ones of civilization, culture,
behavior; how to avoid certain vulgarities and follies, how to inculcate certain principles:
and to illustrate these points heroic types are not needed. In other words, the situation being
unheroic, so must the actors be; for, apart from the inspirations of circumstances, Napoleon
no more than John Smith is recognizable as a hero.

Now, in adopting this view, a writer places himself under several manifest disadvantages. If
you are to be an agnostic, it is better (for novel- writing purposes) not to be a complacent
or resigned one. Otherwise your characters will find it difficult to show what is in them.
A man reveals and classifies himself in proportion to the severity of the condition or action
required of him, hence the American novelist's people are in considerable straits to make themselves
adequately known to us. They cannot lay bare their inmost soul over a cup of tea or a picture
by Corot; so, in order to explain themselves, they must not only submit to dissection at the
author's hands, but must also devote no little time and ingenuity to dissecting themselves
and one another. But dissection is one thing, and the living word rank from the heart and absolutely
reeking of the human creature that uttered it--the word that Turguenieff's people are constantly
uttering--is another. Moreover, in the dearth of commanding traits and stirring events, there
is a continual temptation to magnify those which are petty and insignificant. Instead of a
telescope to sweep the heavens, we are furnished with a microscope to detect infusoria. We
want a description of a mountain; and, instead of receiving an outline, naked and severe, perhaps,
but true and impressive, we are introduced to a tiny field on its immeasurable side, and we
go botanizing and insect- hunting there. This is realism; but it is the realism of texture,
not of form and relation. It encourages our glance to be near-sighted instead of comprehensive.
Above all, there is a misgiving that we do not touch the writer's true quality, and that these
scenes of his, so elaborately and conscientiously prepared, have cost him much thought and
pains, but not one throb of the heart or throe of the spirit. The experiences that he depicts
have not, one fancies, marked wrinkles on his forehead or turned his hair gray. There are two
kinds of reserve--the reserve which feels that its message is too mighty for it, and the reserve
which feels that it is too mighty for its message. Our new school of writers is reserved, but
its reserve does not strike one as being of the former kind. It cannot be said of any one of
Mr. James's stories, "This is his best," or "This is his worst," because no one of them is
all one way. They have their phases of strength and veracity, and, also, phases that are neither
veracious nor strong. The cause may either lie in a lack of experience in a certain direction
on the writer's part; or else in his reluctance to write up to the experience he has. The experience
in question is not of the ways of the world,--concerning which Mr. James has every sign of
being politely familiar,--nor of men and women in their every-day aspect; still less of literary
ways and means, for of these, in his own line, he is a master. The experience referred to is
experience of passion. If Mr. James be not incapable of describing passion, at all events he
has still to show that he is capable of it. He has introduced us to many characters that seem
to have in them capacity for the highest passion,--as witness Christina Light,--and yet he
has never allowed them an opportunity to develop it. He seems to evade the situation; but the
evasion is managed with so much plausibility that, although we may be disappointed, or even
irritated, and feel, more or less vaguely, that we have been unfairly dealt with, we are unable
to show exactly where or how the unfairness comes in. Thus his novels might be compared to
a beautiful face, full of culture and good breeding, but lacking that fire of the eye and fashion
of the lip that betray a living human soul.

The other one of the two writers whose names are so often mentioned together, seems to have
taken up the subject of our domestic and social pathology; and the minute care and conscientious
veracity which he has brought to bear upon his work has not been surpassed, even by Shakespeare.
But, if I could venture a criticism upon his productions, it would be to the effect that there
is not enough fiction in them. They are elaborate and amiable reports of what we see around
us. They are not exactly imaginative,--in the sense in which I have attempted to define the
word. There are two ways of warning a man against unwholesome life--one is, to show him a picture
of disease; the other is, to show him a picture of health. The former is the negative, the
latter the positive treatment. Both have their merits; but the latter is, perhaps, the better
adapted to novels, the former to essays. A novelist should not only know what he has got; he
should also know what he wants. His mind should have an active, or theorizing, as well as a
passive, or contemplative, side. He should have energy to discount the people he personally
knows; the power to perceive what phases of thought are to be represented, as well as to describe
the persons who happen to be their least inadequate representatives; the sagacity to analyze
the age or the moment, and to reveal its tendency and meaning. Mr. Howells has produced a great
deal of finely wrought tapestry; but does not seem, as yet, to have found a hall fit to adorn
it with.

And yet Mr. James and Mr. Howells have done more than all the rest of us to make our literature
respectable during the last ten years. If texture be the object, they have brought texture
to a fineness never surpassed anywhere. They have discovered charm and grace in much that was
only blank before. They have detected and described points of human nature hitherto unnoticed,
which, if not intrinsically important, will one day be made auxiliary to the production of
pictures of broader as well as minuter veracity than have heretofore been produced. All that
seems wanting thus far is a direction, an aim, a belief. Agnosticism has brought about a pause
for a while, and no doubt a pause is preferable to some kinds of activity. It may enable us,
when the time comes to set forward again, to do so with better equipment and more intelligent
purpose. It will not do to be always at a prophetic heat of enthusiasm, sympathy, denunciation:
the coolly critical mood is also useful to prune extravagance and promote a sense of responsibility.
The novels of Mr. James and of Mr. Howells have taught us that men and women are creatures
of infinitely complicated structure, and that even the least of these complications, if it
is portrayed at all, is worth portraying truthfully. But we cannot forget, on the other hand,
that honest emotion and hearty action are necessary to the wholesomeness of society, because
in their absence society is afflicted with a lamentable sameness and triviality; the old primitive
impulses remain, but the food on which they are compelled to feed is insipid and unsustaining;
our eyes are turned inward instead of outward, and each one of us becomes himself the Rome
towards which all his roads lead. Such books as these authors have written are not the Great
American Novel, because they take life and humanity not in their loftier, but in their lesser
manifestations. They are the side scenes and the background of a story that has yet to be written.
That story will have the interest not only of the collision of private passions and efforts,
but of the great ideas and principles which characterize and animate a nation. It will discriminate
between what is accidental and what is permanent, between what is realistic and what is real,
between what is sentimental and what is sentiment. It will show us not only what we are, but
what we are to be; not only what to avoid, but what to do. It will rest neither in the tragic
gloom of Turguenieff, nor in the critical composure of James, nor in the gentle deprecation
of Howells, but will demonstrate that the weakness of man is the motive and condition of his
strength. It will not shrink from romance, nor from ideality, nor from artistic completeness,
because it will know at what depths and heights of life these elements are truly operative.
It will be American, not because its scene is laid or its characters born in the United States,
but because its burden will be reaction against old tyrannies and exposure of new hypocrisies;
a refutation of respectable falsehoods, and a proclamation of unsophisticated truths. Indeed,
let us take heed and diligently improve our native talent, lest a day come when the Great American
Novel make its appearance, but written in a foreign language, and by some author who-- however
purely American at heart--never set foot on the shores of the Republic.

CHAPTER III.

AMERICANISM IN FICTION.

Contemporary criticism will have it that, in order to create an American Literature, we must
use American materials. The term "Literature" has, no doubt, come to be employed in a loose
sense. The London Saturday Review has (or used to have until lately) a monthly two-column article
devoted to what it called "American Literature," three-fourths of which were devoted to an
examination of volumes of State Histories, Statistical Digests, Records of the Census, and
other such works as were never, before or since, suspected of being literature; while the remaining
fourth mentioned the titles (occasionally with a line of comment) of whatever productions were
at hand in the way of essays, novels, and poetry. This would seem to indicate that we may have--nay,
are already possessed of--an American Literature, composed of American materials, provided
only that we consent to adopt the Saturday Review's conception of what literature is.

Many of us believe, however, that the essays, the novels, and the poetry, as well as the statistical
digests, ought to go to the making up of a national literature. It has been discovered, however,
that the existence of the former does not depend, to the same extent as that of the latter,
upon the employment of exclusively American material. A book about the census, if it be not
American, is nothing; but a poem or a romance, though written by a native-born American, who,
perhaps, has never crossed the Atlantic, not only may, but frequently does, have nothing in
it that can be called essentially American, except its English and, occasionally, its ideas.
And the question arises whether such productions can justly be held to form component parts
of what shall hereafter be recognized as the literature of America.

How was it with the makers of English literature? Beginning with Chaucer, his "Canterbury Pilgrims"
is English, both in scene and character; it is even mentioned of the Abbess that "Frenche of
Paris was to her unknowe"; but his "Legende of Goode Women" might, so far as its subject-matter
is concerned, have been written by a French, a Spanish, or an Italian Chaucer, just as well
as by the British Daniel. Spenser's "Faerie Queene" numbers St. George and King Arthur among
its heroes; but its scene is laid in Faerie Lande, if it be laid anywhere, and it is a barefaced
moral allegory throughout. Shakespeare wrote thirty-seven plays, the elimination of which from
English literature would undeniably be a serious loss to it; yet, of these plays twenty-three
have entirely foreign scenes and characters. Milton, as a political writer, was English; but
his "Paradise Lost and Regained," his "Samson," his "Ode on the Nativity," his "Comus," bear
no reference to the land of his birth. Dryden's best-known work to- day is his "Alexander's
Feast." Pope has come down to us as the translator of Homer. Richardson, Fielding, Smollett,
and Sterne are the great quartet of English novelists of the last century; but Smollett, in
his preface to "Roderick Random," after an admiring allusion to the "Gil Blas" of Le Sage,
goes on to say: "The following sheets I have modelled on his plan"; and Sterne was always talking
and thinking about Cervantes, and comparing himself to the great Spaniard: "I think there is
more laughable humor, with an equal degree of Cervantic satire, if not more, than in the last,"
he writes of one of his chapters, to "my witty widow, Mrs. F." Many even of Walter Scott's
romances are un-English in their elements; and the fame of Shelley, Keats, and Byron rests
entirely upon their "foreign" work. Coleridge's poetry and philosophy bear no technical stamp
of nationality; and, to come down to later times, Carlyle was profoundly imbued with Germanism,
while the "Romola" of George Eliot and the "Cloister and the Hearth" of Charles Reade are by
many considered to be the best of their works. In the above enumeration innumerable instances
in point are, of course, omitted; but enough have been given, perhaps, to show that imaginative
writers have not generally been disowned by their country on the ground that they have availed
themselves, in their writings, of other scenes and characters than those of their own immediate
neighborhoods.

The statistics of the work of the foremost American writers could easily be shown to be much
more strongly imbued with the specific flavor of their environment. Benjamin Franklin, though
he was an author before the United States existed, was American to the marrow. The "Leather-Stocking
Tales" of Cooper are the American epic. Irving's "Knickerbocker" and his "Woolfert's Roost"
will long outlast his other productions. Poe's most popular tale, "The Gold-Bug," is American
in its scene, and so is "The Mystery of Marie Roget," in spite of its French nomenclature;
and all that he wrote is strongly tinged with the native hue of his strange genius. Longfellow's
"Evangeline" and "Hiawatha" and "Miles Standish," and such poems as "The Skeleton in Armor"
and "The Building of the Ship," crowd out of sight his graceful translations and adaptations.
Emerson is the veritable American eagle of our literature, so that to be Emersonian is to be
American. Whittier and Holmes have never looked beyond their native boundaries, and Hawthorne
has brought the stern gloom of the Puritan period and the uneasy theorizings of the present
day into harmony with the universal and permanent elements of human nature. There was certainly
nothing European visible in the crude but vigorous stories of Theodore Winthrop; and Bret Harte,
the most brilliant figure among our later men, is not only American, but Californian,--as is,
likewise, the Poet of the Sierras. It is not necessary to go any further. Mr. Henry James,
having enjoyed early and singular opportunities of studying the effects of the recent annual
influx of Americans, cultured and otherwise, into England and the Continent, has very sensibly
and effectively, and with exquisite grace of style and pleasantness of thought, made the phenomenon
the theme of a remarkable series of stories. Hereupon the cry of an "International School"
has been raised, and critics profess to be seriously alarmed lest we should ignore the signal
advantages for mise-en-scene presented by this Western half of the planet, and should enter
into vain and unpatriotic competition with foreign writers on their own ground. The truth is,
meanwhile, that it would have been a much surer sign of affectation in us to have abstained
from literary comment upon the patent and notable fact of this international rapprochement,--which
is just as characteristic an American trait as the episode of the Argonauts of 1849, --and
we have every reason to be grateful to Mr. Henry James, and to his school, if he has any, for
having rescued us from the opprobrium of so foolish a piece of know-nothingism. The phase is,
of course, merely temporary; its interest and significance will presently be exhausted; but,
because we are American, are we to import no French cakes and English ale? As a matter of fact,
we are too timid and self-conscious; and these infirmities imply a much more serious obstacle
to the formation of a characteristic literature than does any amount of gadding abroad.

That must be a very shallow literature which depends for its national flavor and character
upon its topography and its dialect; and the criticism which can conceive of no deeper Americanism
than this is shallower still. What is an American book? It is a book written by an American,
and by one who writes as an American; that is, unaffectedly. So an English book is a book written
by an unaffected Englishman. What difference can it make what the subject of the writing is?
Mr. Henry James lately brought out a volume of essays on "French Poets and Novelists." Mr.
E. C. Stedman recently published a series of monographs on "The Victorian Poets." Are these
books French and English, or are they nondescript, or are they American? Not only are they
American, but they are more essentially American than if they had been disquisitions upon American
literature. And the reason is, of course, that they subject the things of the old world to
the tests of the new, and thereby vindicate and illustrate the characteristic mission of America
to mankind. We are here to hold up European conventionalisms and prejudices in the light of
the new day, and thus afford everybody the opportunity, never heretofore enjoyed, of judging
them by other standards, and in other surroundings than those amidst which they came into existence.
In the same way, Emerson's "English Traits" is an American thing, and it gives categorical
reasons why American things should be. And what is an American novel except a novel treating
of persons, places, and ideas from an American point of view? The point of view is the point,
not the thing seen from it.

But it is said that "the great American novel," in order fully to deserve its name, ought to
have American scenery. Some thousands of years ago, the Greeks had a novelist--Homer--who evolved
the great novel of that epoch; but the scenery of that novel was Trojan, not Greek. The story
is a criticism, from a Greek standpoint, of foreign affairs, illustrated with practical examples;
and, as regards treatment, quite as much care is bestowed upon the delineation of Hector, Priam,
and Paris, as upon Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Achilles. The same story, told by a Trojan Homer,
would doubtless have been very different; but it is by no means certain that it would have
been any better told. It embodies, whether symbolically or literally matters not, the triumph
of Greek ideas and civilization. But, even so, the sympathies of the reader are not always,
or perhaps uniformly, on the conquering side. Homer was doubtless a patriot, but he shows no
signs of having been a bigot. He described that great international episode with singular impartiality;
what chiefly interested him was the play of human nature. Nevertheless, there is no evidence
that the Greeks were backward in admitting his claims as their national poet; and we may legitimately
conclude that were an American Homer--whether in prose or poetry--to appear among us, he might
pitch his scene where he liked--in Patagonia, or on the banks of the Zambezi--and we should
accept the situation with perfect equanimity. Only let him be a native of New York, or Boston,
or San Francisco, or Mullenville, and be inspired with the American idea, and we ask no more.
Whatever he writes will belong to our literature, and add lustre to it.

One hears many complaints about the snobbishness of running after things European. Go West,
young man, these moralists say, or go down Fifth Avenue, and investigate Chatham Street, and
learn that all the elements of romance, to him who has the seeing eye, lie around your own
front doorstep and back yard. But let not these persons forget that he who fears Europe is
a less respectable snob than he who studies it. Let us welcome Europe in our books as freely
as we do at Castle Garden; we may do so safely. If our digestion be not strong enough to assimilate
her, and work up whatever is valuable in her into our own bone and sinew, then America is not
the thing we took her for. For what is America? Is it simply a reproduction of one of these
Eastern nationalities, which we are so fond of alluding to as effete? Surely not. It is a new
departure in history; it is a new door opened to the development of the human race, or, as
I should prefer to say, of humanity. We are misled by the chatter of politicians and the bombast
of Congress. In the course of ages, the time has at last arrived when man, all over this planet,
is entering upon a new career of moral, intellectual, and political emancipation; and America
is the concrete expression and theatre of that great fact, as all spiritual truths find their
fitting and representative physical incarnation. But what would this huge western continent
be, if America--the real America of the mind--had no existence? It would be a body without
a soul, and would better, therefore, not be at all. If America is to be a repetition of Europe
on a larger scale, it is not worth the pain of governing it. Europe has shown what European
ideas can accomplish; and whatever fresh thought or impulse comes to birth in it can be nothing
else than an American thought and impulse, and must sooner or later find its way here, and
become naturalized with its brethren. Buds and blossoms of America are sprouting forth all
over the Old World, and we gather in the fruit. They do not find themselves at home there,
but they know where their home is. The old country feels them like thorns in her old flesh,
and is gladly rid of them; but such prickings are the only wholesome and hopeful symptoms she
presents; if they ceased to trouble her, she would be dead indeed. She has an uneasy experience
before her, for a time; but the time will come when she, too, will understand that her ease
is her disease, and then Castle Garden may close its doors, for America will be everywhere.

If, then, America is something vastly more than has hitherto been understood by the word nation,
it is proper that we attach to that other word, patriotism, a significance broader and loftier
than has been conceived till now. By so much as the idea that we represent is great, by so
much are we, in comparison with it, inevitably chargeable with littleness and short-comings.
For we are of the same flesh and blood as our neighbors; it is only our opportunities and our
responsibilities that are fairer and weightier than theirs. Circumstances afford every excuse
to them, but none to us. "E Pluribus Unum" is a frivolous motto; our true one should be, "Noblesse
oblige." But, with a strange perversity, in all matters of comparison between ourselves and
others, we display what we are pleased to call our patriotism by an absurd touchiness as to
points wherein Europe, with its settled and polished civilization, must needs be our superior;
and are quite indifferent about those things by which our real strength is constituted. Can
we not be content to learn from Europe the graces, the refinements, the amenities of life,
so long as we are able to teach her life itself? For my part, I never saw in England any appurtenance
of civilization, calculated to add to the convenience and commodiousness of existence, that
did not seem to me to surpass anything of the kind that we have in this country. Notwithstanding
which--and I am far, indeed, from having any pretensions to asceticism--I would have been fairly
stifled at the idea of having to spend my life there. No American can live in Europe, unless
he means to return home, or unless, at any rate, he returns here in mind, in hope, in belief.
For an American to accept England, or any other country, as both a mental and physical finality,
would, it seems to me, be tantamount to renouncing his very life. To enjoy English comforts
at the cost of adopting English opinions, would be about as pleasant as to have the privilege
of retaining one's body on condition of surrendering one's soul, and would, indeed, amount
to just about the same thing.

I fail, therefore, to feel any apprehension as to our literature becoming Europeanized, because
whatever is American in it must lie deeper than anything European can penetrate. More than
that, I believe and hope that our novelists will deal with Europe a great deal more, and a
great deal more intelligently, than they have done yet. It is a true and healthy artistic instinct
that leads them to do so. Hawthorne--and no American writer had a better right than he to contradict
his own argument--says, in the preface to the "Marble Faun," in a passage that has been often
quoted, but will bear repetition:--

    "Italy, as the site of a romance, was chiefly valuable to him as <
    affording a sort of poetic or fairy precinct, where actualities would
    not be so terribly insisted on as they are, and must needs be, in
    America.

Now, what is to be understood from this passage? It assumes, in the first place, that a work
of art, in order to be effective, must contain profound contrasts of light and shadow; and
then it points out that the shadow, at least, is found ready to the hand in Europe. There is
no hint of patriotic scruples as to availing one's self of such a "picturesque and gloomy"
background; if it is to be had, then let it be taken; the main object to be considered is the
work of art. Europe, in short, afforded an excellent quarry, from which, in Hawthorne's opinion,
the American novelist might obtain materials which are conspicuously deficient in his own country,
and which that country is all the better for not possessing. In the "Marble Faun" the author
had conceived a certain idea, and he considered that he had been not unsuccessful in realizing
it. The subject was new, and full of especial attractions to his genius, and it would manifestly
have been impossible to adapt it to an American setting. There was one drawback connected with
it, and this Hawthorne did not fail to recognize. He remarks in the preface that he had "lived
too long abroad not to be aware that a foreigner seldom acquires that knowledge of a country
at once flexible and profound, which may justify him in endeavoring to idealize its traits."
But he was careful not to attempt "a portraiture of Italian manners and character." He made
use of the Italian scenery and atmosphere just so far as was essential to the development of
his idea, and consistent with the extent of his Italian knowledge; and, for the rest, fell
back upon American characters and principles. The result has been long enough before the world
to have met with a proper appreciation. I have heard regret expressed that the power employed
by the author in working out this story had not been applied to a romance dealing with a purely
American subject. But to analyze this objection is to dispose of it. A man of genius is not,
commonly, enfeebled by his own productions; and, physical accidents aside, Hawthorne was just
as capable of writing another "Scarlet Letter" after the "Marble Faun" was published, as he
had been before. Meanwhile, few will deny that our literature would be a loser had the "Marble
Faun" never been written.

The drawback above alluded to is, however, not to be underrated. It may operate in two ways.
In the first place, the American's European observations may be inaccurate. As a child, looking
at a sphere, might suppose it to be a flat disc, shaded at one side and lighted at the other,
so a sightseer in Europe may ascribe to what he beholds qualities and a character quite at
variance with what a more fundamental knowledge would have enabled him to perceive. In the
second place, the stranger in a strange land, be he as accurate as he may, will always tend
to look at what is around him objectively, instead of allowing it subjectively--or, as it were,
unconsciously--to color his narrative. He will be more apt directly to describe what he sees,
than to convey the feeling or aroma of it without description. It would doubtless, for instance,
be possible for Mr. Henry James to write an "English" or even a "French" novel without falling
into a single technical error; but it is no less certain that a native writer, of equal ability,
would treat the same subject in a very different manner. Mr. James's version might contain
a great deal more of definite information; but the native work would insinuate an impression
which both comes from and goes to a greater depth of apprehension.

But, on the other hand, it is not contended that any American should write an "English" or
anything but an "American" novel. The contention is, simply, that he should not refrain from
using foreign material, when it happens to suit his exigencies, merely because it is foreign.
Objective writing may be quite as good reading as subjective writing, in its proper place and
function. In fiction, no more than elsewhere, may a writer pretend to be what he is not, or
to know what he knows not. When he finds himself abroad, he must frankly admit his situation;
and more will not then be required of him than he is fairly competent to afford. It will seldom
happen, as Hawthorne intimates, that he can successfully reproduce the inner workings and philosophy
of European social and political customs and peculiarities; but he can give a picture of the
scenery as vivid as can the aborigine, or more so; he can make an accurate study of personal
native character; and, finally, and most important of all, he can make use of the conditions
of European civilization in events, incidents, and situations which would be impossible on
this side of the water. The restrictions, the traditions, the law, and the license of those
old countries are full of suggestions to the student of character and circumstances, and supply
him with colors and effects that he would else search for in vain. For the truth may as well
be admitted; we are at a distinct disadvantage, in America, in respect of the materials of
romance. Not that vigorous, pathetic, striking stories may not be constructed here; and there
is humor enough, the humor of dialect, of incongruity of character; but, so far as the story
depends for its effect, not upon psychical and personal, but upon physical and general events
and situations, we soon feel the limit of our resources. An analysis of the human soul, such
as may be found in the "House of the Seven Gables," for instance, is absolute in its interest,
apart from outward conditions. But such an analysis cannot be carried on, so to say, in vacuo.
You must have solid ground to stand on; you must have fitting circumstances, background, and
perspective. The ruin of a soul, the tragedy of a heart, demand, as a necessity of harmony
and picturesque effect, a corresponding and conspiring environment and stage--just as, in music,
the air in the treble is supported and reverberated by the bass accompaniment. The immediate,
contemporary act or predicament loses more than half its meaning and impressiveness if it be
re-echoed from no sounding-board in the past--its notes, however sweetly and truly touched,
fall flatly on the ear. The deeper we attempt to pitch the key of an American story, therefore,
the more difficulty shall we find in providing a congruous setting for it; and it is interesting
to note how the masters of the craft have met the difficulty. In the "Seven Gables"--and I
take leave to say that if I draw illustrations from this particular writer, it is for no other
reason than that he presents, more forcibly than most, a method of dealing with the special
problem we are considering--Hawthorne, with the intuitive skill of genius, evolves a background,
and produces a reverberation, from materials which he may be said to have created almost as
much as discovered. The idea of a house, founded two hundred years ago upon a crime, remaining
ever since in possession of its original owners, and becoming the theatre, at last, of the
judgment upon that crime, is a thoroughly picturesque idea, but it is thoroughly un-American.
Such a thing might conceivably occur, but nothing in this country could well be more unlikely.
No one before Hawthorne had ever thought of attempting such a thing; at all events, no one
else, before or since, has accomplished it. The preface to the romance in question reveals
the principle upon which its author worked, and incidentally gives a new definition of the
term "romance,"--a definition of which, thus far, no one but its propounder has known how to
avail himself. It amounts, in fact, to an acknowledgment that it is impossible to write a "novel"
of American life that shall be at once artistic, realistic, and profound. A novel, he says,
aims at a "very minute fidelity, not merely to the possible, but to the probable and ordinary
course of man's experience." This is good advice, no doubt, but not easy to follow. We can
all understand, however, that the difficulties would be greatly lessened could we but command
backgrounds of the European order. Thackeray, the Brontes, George Eliot, and others have written
great stories, which did not have to be romances, because the literal conditions of life in
England have a picturesqueness and a depth which correspond well enough with whatever moral
and mental scenery we may project upon them. Hawthorne was forced to use the scenery and capabilities
of his native town of Salem. He saw that he could not present these in a realistic light, and
his artistic instinct showed him that he must modify or veil the realism of his figures in
the same degree and manner as that of his accessories. No doubt, his peculiar genius and temperament
eminently qualified him to produce this magical change; it was a remarkable instance of the
spontaneous marriage, so to speak, of the means to the end; and even when, in Italy, he had
an opportunity to write a story which should be accurate in fact, as well as faithful to "the
truth of the human heart," he still preferred a subject which bore to the Italian environment
the same relation that the "House of the Seven Gables" and the "Scarlet Letter" do to the American
one; in other words, the conception of Donatello is removed as much further than Clifford or
Hester Prynne from literal realism as the inherent romance of the Italian setting is above
that of New England. The whole thing is advanced a step further towards pure idealism, the
relative proportions being maintained.

"The Blithedale Romance" is only another instance in point, and here, as before, we find the
principle admirably stated in the preface. "In the old countries," says Hawthorne, "a novelist's
work is not put exactly side by side with nature; and he is allowed a license with regard to
everyday probability, in view of the improved effects he is bound to produce thereby. Among
ourselves, on the contrary, there is as yet no Faery Land, so like the real world that, in
a suitable remoteness, we cannot well tell the difference, but with an atmosphere of strange
enchantment, beheld through which the inhabitants have a propriety of their own. This atmosphere
is what the American romancer needs. In its absence, the beings of his imagination are compelled
to show themselves in the same category as actually living mortals; a necessity that renders
the paint and pasteboard of their composition but too painfully discernible." Accordingly,
Hawthorne selects the Brook Farm episode (or a reflection of it) as affording his drama "a
theatre, a little removed from the highway of ordinary travel, where the creatures of his brain
may play their phantasmagorical antics, without exposing them to too close a comparison with
the actual events of real lives." In this case, therefore, an exceptional circumstance is made
to answer the same purpose that was attained by different means in the other romances.

But in what manner have our other writers of fiction treated the difficulties that were thus
dealt with by Hawthorne?--Herman Melville cannot be instanced here; for his only novel or romance,
whichever it be, was also the most impossible of all his books, and really a terrible example
of the enormities which a man of genius may perpetrate when working in a direction unsuited
to him. I refer, of course, to "Pierre, or the Ambiguities." Oliver Wendell Holmes's two delightful
stories are as favorable examples of what can be done, in the way of an American novel, by
a wise, witty, and learned gentleman, as we are likely to see. Nevertheless, one cannot avoid
the feeling that they are the work of a man who has achieved success and found recognition
in other ways than by stories, or even poems and essays. The interest, in either book, centres
round one of those physiological phenomena which impinge so strangely upon the domain of the
soul; for the rest, they are simply accurate and humorous portraitures of local dialects and
peculiarities, and thus afford little assistance in the search for a universally applicable
rule of guidance. Doctor Holmes, I believe, objects to having the term "medicated" applied
to his tales; but surely the adjective is not reproachful; it indicates one of the most charming
and also, alas! inimitable features of his work.

Bret Harte is probably as valuable a witness as could be summoned in this case. His touch is
realistic, and yet his imagination is poetic and romantic. He has discovered something. He
has done something both new and good. Within the space of some fifty pages, he has painted
a series of pictures which will last as long as anything in the fifty thousand pages of Dickens.
Taking "The Outcasts of Poker Flat" as perhaps the most nearly perfect of the tales, as well
as the most truly representative of the writer's powers, let us try to guess its secret. In
the first place, it is very short,--a single episode, succinctly and eloquently told. The descriptions
of scenery and persons are masterly and memorable. The characters of these persons, their actions,
and the circumstances of their lives, are as rugged, as grotesque, as terrible, and also as
beautiful, as the scenery. Thus an artistic harmony is established,--the thing which is lacking
in so much of our literature. The story moves swiftly on, through humor, pathos, and tragedy,
to its dramatic close. It is given with perfect literary taste, and naught in its phases of
human nature is either extenuated or set down in malice. The little narrative can be read in
a few minutes, and can never be forgotten. But it is only an episode; and it is an episode
of an episode,--that of the Californian gold-fever. The story of the Argonauts is only one
story, after all, and these tales of Harte's are but so many facets of the same gem. They are
not, however, like chapters in a romance; there is no such vital connection between them as
develops a cumulative force. We are no more impressed after reading half a dozen of them than
after the first; they are variations of the same theme. They discover to us no new truth about
human nature; they only show us certain human beings so placed as to act out their naked selves,--to
be neither influenced nor protected by the rewards and screens of conventional civilization.
The affectation and insincerity of our daily life make such a spectacle fresh and pleasing
to us. But we enjoy it because of its unexpectedness, its separateness, its unlikeness to the
ordinary course of existence. It is like a huge, strange, gorgeous flower, an exaggeration
and intensification of such flowers as we know; but a flower without roots, unique, never to
be reproduced. It is fitting that its portrait should be painted; but, once done, it is done
with; we cannot fill our picture-gallery with it. Carlyle wrote the History of the French Revolution,
and Bret Harte has written the History of the Argonauts; but it is absurd to suppose that a
national literature could be founded on either episode.

But though Mr. Harte has not left his fellow-craftsmen anything to gather from the lode which
he opened and exhausted, we may still learn something from his method. He took things as he
found them, and he found them disinclined to weave themselves into an elaborate and balanced
narrative. He recognized the deficiency of historical perspective, but he saw that what was
lost in slowly growing, culminating power was gained in vivid, instant force. The deeds of
his character could not be represented as the final result of long-inherited proclivities;
but they could appear between their motive and their consequence, like the draw--aim--fire!
of the Western desperado,--as short, sharp, and conclusive. In other words, the conditions
of American life, as he saw it, justified a short story, or any number of them, but not a novel;
and the fact that he did afterwards attempt a novel only served to confirm his original position.
I think that the limitation that he discovered is of much wider application than we are prone
to realize. American life has been, as yet, nothing but a series of episodes, of experiments.
There has been no such thing as a fixed and settled condition of society, not subject to change
itself, and therefore affording a foundation and contrast to minor or individual vicissitudes.
We cannot write American-grown novels, because a novel is not an episode, nor an aggregation
of episodes; we cannot write romances in the Hawthorne sense, because, as yet, we do not seem
to be clever enough. Several courses are, however, open to us, and we are pursuing them all.
First, we are writing "short stories," accounts of episodes needing no historical perspective,
and not caring for any; and, so far as one may judge, we write the best short stories in the
world. Secondly, we may spin out our short stories into long-short stories, just as we may
imagine a baby six feet high; it takes up more room, but is just as much a baby as one of twelve
inches. Thirdly, we may graft our flower of romance on a European stem, and enjoy ourselves
as much as the European novelists do, and with as clear a conscience. We are stealing that
which enriches us and does not impoverish them. It is silly and childish to make the boundaries
of the America of the mind coincide with those of the United States. We need not dispute about
free trade and protection here; literature is not commerce, nor is it politics. America is
not a petty nationality, like France, England, and Germany; but whatever in such nationalities
tends toward enlightenment and freedom is American. Let us not, therefore, confirm ourselves
in a false and ignoble conception of our meaning and mission in the world. Let us not carry
into the temple of the Muse the jealousies, the prejudice, the ignorance, the selfishness of
our "Senate" and "Representatives," strangely so called! Let us not refuse to breathe the air
of Heaven, lest there be something European or Asian in it. If we cannot have a national literature
in the narrow, geographical sense of the phrase, it is because our inheritance transcends all
geographical definitions. The great American novel may not be written this year, or even in
this century. Meanwhile, let us not fear to ride, and ride to death, whatever species of Pegasus
we can catch. It can do us no harm, and it may help us to acquire a firmer seat against the
time when our own, our very own winged steed makes his appearance.

CHAPTER IV.

LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN.

Literature is that quality in books which affords delight and nourishment to the soul. But
this is a scientific and skeptical age, insomuch that one hardly ventures to take for granted
that every reader will know what his soul is. It is not the intellect, though it gives the
intellect light; nor the emotions, though they receive their warmth from it. It is the most
catholic and constant element of human nature, yet it bears no direct part in the practical
affairs of life; it does not struggle, it does not even suffer; but merely emerges or retires,
glows or congeals, according to the company in which it finds itself. We might say that the
soul is a name for man's innate sympathy with goodness and truth in the abstract; for no man
can have a bad soul, though his heart may be evil, or his mind depraved, because the soul's
access to the mind or heart has been so obstructed as to leave the moral consciousness cold
and dark. The soul, in other words, is the only conservative and peacemaker; it affords the
only unalterable ground upon which all men can always meet; it unselfishly identifies or unites
us with our fellows, in contradistinction to the selfish intellect, which individualizes us
and sets each man against every other. Doubtless, then, the soul is an amiable and desirable
possession, and it would be a pity to deprive it of so much encouragement as may be compatible
with due attention to the serious business of life. For there are moments, even in the most
active careers, when it seems agreeable to forget competition, rivalry, jealousy; when it is
a rest to think of one's self as a man rather than a person;--moments when time and place appear
impertinent, and that most profitable which affords least palpable profit. At such seasons,
a man looks inward, or, as the American poet puts it, he loafs and invites his soul, and then
he is at a disadvantage if his soul, in consequence of too persistent previous neglect, declines
to respond to the invitation, and remains immured in that secret place which, as years pass
by, becomes less and less accessible to so many of us.

When I say that literature nourishes the soul, I implicitly refuse the title of literature
to anything in books that either directly or indirectly promotes any worldly or practical use.
Of course, what is literature to one man may be anything but literature to another, or to the
same man under different circumstances; Virgil to the schoolboy, for instance, is a very different
thing from the Virgil of the scholar. But whatever you read with the design of improving yourself
in some profession, or of acquiring information likely to be of advantage to you in any pursuit
or contingency, or of enabling yourself to hold your own with other readers, or even of rendering
yourself that enviable nondescript, a person of culture,--whatever, in short, is read with
any assignable purpose whatever, is in so far not literature. The Bible may be literature to
Mr. Matthew Arnold, because he reads it for fun; but to Luther, Calvin, or the pupils of a
Sunday-school, it is essentially something else. Literature is the written communications of
the soul of mankind with itself; it is liable to appear in the most unexpected places, and
in the oddest company; it vanishes when we would grasp it, and appears when we look not for
it. Chairs of literature are established in the great universities, and it is literature, no
doubt, that the professor discourses; but it ceases to be literature before it reaches the
student's ear; though, again, when the same students stumble across it in the recesses of their
memory ten or twenty years later, it may have become literature once more. Finally, literature
may, upon occasion, avail a man more than the most thorough technical information; but it will
not be because it supplements or supplants that information, but because it has so tempered
and exalted his general faculty that whatever he may do is done more clearly and comprehensively
than might otherwise be the case.

Having thus, in some measure, considered what is literature and what the soul, let us note,
further, that the literature proper to manhood is not proper to childhood, though the reverse
is not--or, at least, never ought to be--true. In childhood, the soul and the mind act in harmony;
the mind has not become preoccupied or sophisticated by so-called useful knowledge; it responds
obediently to the soul's impulses and intuitions. Children have no morality; they have not
yet descended to the level where morality suggests itself to them. For morality is the outcome
of spiritual pride, the most stubborn and insidious of all sins; the pride which prompts each
of us to declare himself holier than his fellows, and to support that claim by parading his
docility to the Decalogue. Docility to any set of rules, no matter of how divine authority,
so long as it is inspired by hope of future good or present advantage, is rather worse than
useless: except our righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees,--that is, except
it be spontaneous righteousness or morality, and, therefore, not morality, but unconscious
goodness,--we shall in no wise have benefited either ourselves or others. Children, when left
to themselves, artlessly and innocently act out the nature that is common to saint and sinner
alike; they are selfish, angry, and foolish, because their state is human; and they are loving,
truthful, and sincere, because their origin is divine. All that pleases or agrees with them
is good; all that opposes or offends them is evil, and this, without any reference whatever
to the moral code in vogue among their elders. But, on the other hand, children cannot be tempted
as we are, because they suppose that everything is free and possible, and because they are
as yet uncontaminated by the artificial cravings which the artificial prohibitions incident
to our civilization create. Life is to them a constantly widening circle of things to be had
and enjoyed; nor does it ever occur to them that their desires can conflict with those of others,
or with the laws of the universe. They cannot consciously do wrong, nor understand that any
one else can do so; untoward accidents may happen, but inanimate nature is just as liable to
be objectionable in this respect as human beings: the stone that trips them up, the thorn that
scratches them, the snow that makes their flesh tingle, is an object of their resentment in
just the same kind and degree as are the men and women who thwart or injure them. But of duty--that
dreary device to secure future reward by present suffering; of conscientiousness--that fear
of present good for the sake of future punishment; of remorse--that disavowal of past pleasure
for fear of the sting in its tail; of ambition--that begrudging of all honorable results that
are not effected by one's self; of these, and all similar politic and arbitrary masks of self-love
and pusillanimity, these poor children know and suspect nothing. Yet their eyes are much keener
than ours, for they see through the surface of nature and perceive its symbolism; they see
the living reality, of which nature is the veil, and are continually at fault because this
veil is not, after all, the reality,--because it is fixed and unplastic. The "deep mind of
dauntless infancy" is, in fact, the only revelation we have, except divine revelation itself,
of that pure and natural life of man which we dream of, and liken to heaven; but we, nevertheless,
in our penny-wise, pound-foolish way, insist upon regarding it as ignorance, and do our best,
from the earliest possible moment, to disenchant and dispel it. We call the outrage education,
understanding thereby the process of exterminating in the child the higher order of faculties
and the intuitions, and substituting for them the external memory, timidity, self-esteem, and
all that armament of petty weapons and defences which may enable us to get the better of our
fellow-creatures in this world, and receive the reward of our sagacity in the next. The success
of our efforts is pitiably complete; for though the child, if fairly engaged in single combat,
might make a formidable resistance against the infliction of "lessons," it cannot long withstand
our crafty device of sending it to a place where it sees a score or a hundred of little victims
like itself, all being driven to the same Siberia. The spirit of emulation is aroused, and
lo! away they all scamper, each straining its utmost to reach the barren goal ahead of all
competitors. So do we make the most ignoble passions of our children our allies in the unholy
task of divesting them of their childhood. And yet, who is not aware that the best men the
world has seen have been those who, throughout their lives, retained the aroma of childlike
simplicity which they brought with them into existence? Learning--the acquisition of specific
facts--is not wisdom; it is almost incompatible with wisdom; indeed, unless the mind be powerful
enough not only to fuse its facts, but to vaporize them,--to sublimate them into an impalpable
atmosphere,--they will stand in wisdom's way. Wisdom comes from the pondering and the application
to life of certain truths quite above the sphere of facts, and of infinitely more moment and
less complexity,--truths which are often found to be in accordance with the spiritual instinct
called intuition, which children possess more fully than grown persons. The wisdom of our children
would often astonish us, if we would only forbear the attempt to make them knowing, and submissively
accept instruction from them. Through all the imperfection of their inherited infirmity, we
shall ever and anon be conscious of the radiance of a beautiful, unconscious intelligence,
worth more than the smartness of schools and the cleverness of colleges. But no; we abhor the
very notion of it, and generally succeed in extinguishing it long before the Three R's are
done with.

And yet, by wisely directing the child's use of the first of the Three, much of the ill effects
of the trio and their offspring might be counteracted. If we believed--if the great mass of
people known as the civilized world did actually and livingly believe--that there was really
anything beyond or above the physical order of nature, our children's literature, wrongly so
called, would not be what it is. We believe what we can see and touch; we teach them to believe
the same, and, not satisfied with that, we sedulously warn them not to believe anything else.
The child, let us suppose, has heard from some unauthorized person that there are fairies--little
magical creatures an inch high, up to all manner of delightful feats. He comprehends the whole
matter at half a word, feels that he had known it already, and half thinks that he sees one
or two on his way home. He runs up to his mother and tells her about it; and has she ever seen
fairies? Alas! His mother tells him that the existence of such a being as a fairy is impossible.
In old times, when the world was very ignorant and superstitious, they used to ascribe everything
that happened to supernatural agency; even the trifling daily accidents of one's life, such
as tumbling down stairs, or putting the right shoe on the left foot, were thought or fancied
to be the work of some mysterious power; and since ignorant people are very apt to imagine
they see what they believe [proceeds this mother] instead of only believing what they see;
and since, furthermore, ignorance disposes to exaggeration and thus to untruth, these people
ended by asserting that they saw fairies. "Now, my child," continues the parent, "it would
grieve me to see you the victim of such folly. Do not read fairy stories. They are not true
to life; they fill your mind with idle notions; they cannot form your understanding, or aid
you to do your work in the world. If you should happen to fall in with such fables, be careful
as you read to bear in mind that they are pure inventions--pretty, sometimes, perhaps, but
essentially frivolous, if not immoral. You have, however, thanks to the enlightened enterprise
of writers and publishers, an endless assortment of juvenile books and periodicals which combine
legitimate amusement with sound and trustworthy instruction. Here are stories about little
children, just like yourself, who talk and act just as you do, and to whom nothing supernatural
or outlandish ever happens; and whose adventures, when you have read them, convey to you some
salutary moral lesson. What more can you want? Yes, very likely 'Grimm's Tales' and 'The Arabian
Nights' may seem more attractive; but in this world many harmful things put on an inviting
guise, which deceives the inexperienced eye. May my child remember that all is not gold that
glitters, and desire, not what is diverting merely, but what is useful and ... and conventional!"

Let us admit that, things being as they are, it is necessary to develop the practical side
of the child's nature, to ground him in moral principles, and to make him comprehend and fear--nominally
God, but really--society. But why, in addition to doing this, should we strangle the unpractical
side of his nature,--the ideal, imaginative, spiritual side,--the side which alone can determine
his value or worthlessness in eternity? If our minds were visible as our bodies are, we should
behold on every side of us, and in our own private looking-glasses, such abortions, cripples,
and monstrosities as all the slums of Europe and the East could not parallel. We pretend to
make little men and women out of our children, and we make little dwarfs and hobgoblins out
of them. Moreover, we should not diminish even the practical efficiency of the coming generation
by rejecting their unpractical side. Whether this boy's worldly destination be to clean a stable
or to represent his country at a foreign court, he will do his work all the better, instead
of worse, for having been allowed freedom of expansion on the ideal plane. He will do it comprehensively,
or as from above downward, instead of blindly, or as from below upward. To a certain extent,
this position is very generally admitted by instructors nowadays; but the admission bears little
or no fruit. The ideality and imagination which they have in mind are but a partial and feeble
imitation of what is really signified by those terms. Ideality and imagination are themselves
merely the symptom or expression of the faculty and habit of spiritual or subjective intuition--a
faculty of paramount value in life, though of late years, in the rush of rational knowledge
and discovery, it has fallen into neglect. But it is by means of this faculty alone that the
great religion of India was constructed--the most elaborate and seductive of all systems; and
although as a faith Buddhism is also the most treacherous and dangerous attack ever made upon
the immortal welfare of mankind, that circumstance certainly does not discredit or invalidate
the claim to importance of spiritual intuition itself. It may be objected that spiritual intuition
is a vague term. It undoubtedly belongs to an abstruse region of psychology; but its meaning
for our present purpose is simply the act of testing questions of the moral consciousness by
an inward touchstone of truth, instead of by external experience or information. That the existence
of such a touchstone should be ridiculed by those who are accustomed to depend for their belief
upon palpable or logical evidence, goes without saying; but, on the other hand, there need
be no collision or argument on the point, since no question with which intuition is concerned
can ever present itself to persons who pin their faith to the other sort of demonstration.
The reverse of this statement is by no means true; but it would lead us out of our present
path to discuss the matter.

Assuming, however, that intuition is possible, it is evident that it should exist in children
in an extremely pure, if not in its most potent state; and to deny it opportunity of development
might fairly be called a barbarity. It will hardly be disputed that children are an important
element in society. Without them we should lose the memory of our youth, and all opportunity
for the exercise of unselfish and disinterested affection. Life would become arid and mechanical
to a degree now scarcely conceivable; chastity and all the human virtues would cease to exist;
marriage would be an aimless and absurd transaction; and the brotherhood of man, even in the
nominal sense that it now exists, would speedily be abjured. Political economy and sociology
neglect to make children an element in their arguments and deductions, and no small part of
their error is attributable to that circumstance. But although children still are born, and
all the world acknowledges their paramount moral and social value, the general tendency of
what we are forced to call education at the present day is to shorten as much as possible the
period of childhood. In America and Germany especially--but more in America than in Germany--
children are urged and stimulated to "grow up" almost before they have been short-coated. That
conceptions of order and discipline should be early instilled into them is proper enough; but
no other order and discipline seems to be contemplated by educators than the forcing them to
stand and be stuffed full of indigestible and incongruous knowledge, than which proceeding
nothing more disorderly could be devised. It looks as if we felt the innocence and naturalness
of our children to be a rebuke to us, and wished to do away with it in short order. There is
something in the New Testament about offending the little ones, and the preferred alternative
thereto; and really we are outraging not only the objective child, but the subjective one also--that
in ourselves, namely, which is innocent and pure, and without which we had better not be at
all. Now I do not mean to say that the only medicine that can cure this malady is legitimate
children's literature; wise parents are also very useful, though not perhaps so generally available.
My present contention is that the right sort of literature is an agent of great efficiency,
and may be very easily come by. Children derive more genuine enjoyment and profit from a good
book than most grown people are susceptible of: they see what is described, and themselves
enact and perfect the characters of the story as it goes along.

Nor is it indispensable that literature of the kind required should forthwith be produced;
a great deal, of admirable quality, is already on hand. There are a few great poems----Spenser's
"Faerie Queene" is one-- which no well regulated child should be without; but poetry in general
is not exactly what we want. Children--healthy children--never have the poetic genius; but
they are born mystics, and they have the sense of humor. The best way to speak to them is in
prose, and the best kind of prose is the symbolic. The hermetic philosophers of the Middle
Ages are probably the authors of some of the best children's stories extant. In these tales,
disguised beneath what is apparently the simplest and most artless flow of narrative, profound
truths are discussed and explained. The child reads the narrative, and certainly cannot be
accused of comprehending the hidden philosophical problem; yet that also has its share in charming
him. The reason is partly that true symbolic or figurative writing is the simplest form known
to literature. The simplest, that is to say, in outward form,--it may be indefinitely abstruse
as to its inward contents. Indeed, the very cause of its formal simplicity is its interior
profundity. The principle of hermetic writing was, as we know, to disguise philosophical propositions
and results under a form of words which should ostensibly signify some very ordinary and trivial
thing. It was a secret language, in the vocabulary of which material facts are used to represent
spiritual truths. But it differed from ordinary secret language in this, that not only were
the truths represented in the symbols, but the philosophical development of the truth, in its
ramifications, was completely evolved under the cover of a logically consistent tale. This,
evidently, is a far higher achievement of ingenuity than merely to string together a series
of unrelated parts of speech, which, on being tested by the "key," shall discover the message
or information really intended. It is, in fact, a practical application of the philosophical
discovery, made by or communicated to the hermetic philosophers, that every material object
in nature answers to or corresponds with a certain one or group of philosophical truths. Viewed
in this light, the science of symbols or of correspondences ceases to be an arbitrary device,
susceptible of alteration according to fancy, and avouches itself an essential and consistent
relation between the things of the mind and the things of the senses. There is a complete mental
creation, answering to the material creation, not continuously evolved from it, but on a different
or detached plane. The sun,--to take an example,--the source of light and heat, and thereby
of physical nature, is in these fables always the symbol of God, of love and wisdom, by which
the spirit of man is created. Light, then, answers to wisdom, and heat to love. And since all
physical substances are the result of the combined action of light and heat, we may easily
perceive how these hermetic sages were enabled to use every physical object as a cloak of its
corresponding philosophical truth,--with no other liability to error than might result from
the imperfect condition of their knowledge of physical laws.

To return, however, to the children, I need scarcely remark that the cause of children's taking
so kindly to hermetic writing is that it is actually a living writing; it is alive in precisely
the same way that nature, or man himself, is alive. Matter is dead; life organizes and animates
it. And all writing is essentially dead which is a mere transcript of fact, and is not inwardly
organized and vivified by a spiritual significance. Children do not know what it is that makes
a human being smile, move, and talk; but they know that such a phenomenon is infinitely more
interesting than a doll; and they prove it by themselves supplying the doll with speech and
motions out of their own minds, so as to make it as much like a real person as possible. In
the same way, they do not perceive the philosophical truth which is the cause of existence
of the hermetic fable; but they find that fable far more juicy and substantial than the ordinary
narrative of every-day facts, because, however fine the surface of the latter may be, it has,
after all, nothing but its surface to recommend it. It has no soul; it is not alive; and, though
they cannot explain why, they feel the difference between that thin, fixed grimace and the
changing smile of the living countenance.

It would scarcely be practicable, however, to confine the children's reading to hermetic literature;
for not much of it is extant in its pure state. But it is hardly too much to say that all fairy
stories, and derivations from these, trace their descent from an hermetic ancestry. They are
often unaware of their genealogy; but the sparks of that primal vitality are in them. The fairy
is itself a symbol for the expression of a more complex and abstract idea; but, once having
come into existence, and being, not a pure symbol, but a hybrid between the symbol and that
for which it stands, it presently began an independent career of its own. The mediaeval imagination
went to work with it, found it singularly and delightfully plastic to its touch and requirements,
and soon made it the centre of a new and charming world, in which a whole army of graceful
and romantic fancies, which are always in quest of an arena in which to disport themselves
before the mind, found abundant accommodation and nourishment. The fairy land of mediaeval
Christianity seems to us the most satisfactory of all fairy lands, probably because it is more
in accord with our genius and prejudices than those of the East; and it fitted in so aptly
with the popular mediaeval ignorance on the subject of natural phenomena, that it became actually
an article of belief with the mass of men, who trembled at it while they invented it, in the
most delicious imaginable state of enchanted alarm. All this is prime reading for children;
because, though it does not carry an orderly spiritual meaning within it, it is more spiritual
than material, and is constructed entirely according to the dictates of an exuberant and richly
colored, but, nevertheless, in its own sphere, legitimate imagination. Indeed, fairy land,
though as it were accidentally created, has the same permanent right to be that Beauty has;
it agrees with a genuine aspect of human nature, albeit one much discountenanced just at present.
The sequel to it, in which romantic human personages are accredited with fairy-like attributes,
as in the "Faerie Queene," already alluded to, is a step in the wrong direction, but not a
step long enough to carry us altogether outside of the charmed circle. The child's instinct
of selection being vast and cordial,--he will make a grain of true imagination suffuse and
glorify a whole acre of twaddle,---we may with security leave him in that fantastic society.
Moreover, some children being less imaginative than others, and all children being less imaginative
in some moods and conditions than at other seasons, the elaborate compositions of Tasso, Cervantes,
and the others, though on the boundary line between what is meat for babes and the other sort
of meat, have also their abiding use.

The "Arabian Nights" introduced us to the domain of the Oriental imagination, and has done
more than all the books of travel in the East to make us acquainted with the Asiatic character
and its differences from our own. From what has already been said on the subject of spiritual
intuition in relation to these races, one is prepared to find that all the Eastern literature
that has any value is hermetic writing, and therefore, in so far, proper for children. But
the incorrigible subtlety of the Oriental intellect has vitiated much of their symbology, and
the sentiment of sheer wonder is stimulated rather than that of orderly imagination. To read
the "Arabian Nights" or the "Bhagavad-Gita" is a sort of dissipation; upon the unhackneyed
mind of the child it leaves a reactionary sense of depression. The life which it embodies is
distorted, over-colored, and exciting; it has not the serene and balanced power of the Western
productions. Moreover, these books were not written with the grave philosophic purpose that
animated our own hermetic school; it is rather a sort of jugglery practised with the subject---an
exercise of ingenuity and invention for their own sake. It indicates a lack of the feeling
of responsibility on the writers' part,--a result, doubtless, of the prevailing fatalism that
underlies all their thought. It is not essentially wholesome, in short; but it is immeasurably
superior to the best of the productions called forth by our modern notions of what should be
given to children to read.

But I can do no more than touch upon this branch of the subject; nor will it be possible to
linger long over the department of our own literature which came into being with "Robinson
Crusoe." No theory as to children's books would be worth much attention which found itself
obliged to exclude that memorable work. Although it submits in a certain measure to classification,
it is almost sui generis; no book of its kind, approaching it in merit, has ever been written.
In what, then, does its fascination consist? There is certainly nothing hermetic about it;
it is the simplest and most studiously matter-of-fact narrative of events, comprehensible without
the slightest effort, and having no meaning that is not apparent on the face of it. And yet
children, and grown people also, read it again and again, and cannot find it uninteresting.
I think the phenomenon may largely be due to the nature of the subject, which is really of
primary and universal interest to mankind. It is the story of the struggle of man with wild
and hostile nature,--in the larger sense an elementary theme,--his shifts, his failures, his
perils, his fears, his hopes, his successes. The character of Robinson is so artfully generalized
or universalized, and sympathy for him is so powerfully aroused and maintained, that the reader,
especially the child reader, inevitably identifies himself with him, and feels his emotions
and struggles as his own. The ingredient of suspense is never absent from the story, and the
absence of any plot prevents us from perceiving its artificiality. It is, in fact, a type of
the history of the human race, not on the higher plane, but on the physical one; the history
of man's contest with and final victory over physical nature. The very simplicity and obviousness
of the details give them grandeur and comprehensiveness: no part of man's character which his
contact with nature can affect or develop is left untried in Robinson. He manifests in little
all historical earthly experiences of the race; such is the scheme of the book; and its permanence
in literature is due to the sobriety and veracity with which that scheme is carried out. To
speak succinctly, it does for the body what the hermetic and cognate literature does for the
soul; and for the healthy man, the body is not less important than the soul in its own place
and degree. It is not the work of the Creator, but it is contingent upon creation.

But poor Robinson has been most unfortunate in his progeny, which at this day overrun the whole
earth, and render it a worse wilderness than ever was the immortal Crusoe Island. Miss Edgeworth,
indeed, might fairly pose as the most persistently malignant of all sources of error in the
design of children's literature; but it is to be feared that it was Defoe who first made her
aware of the availability of her own venom. She foisted her prim and narrow moral code upon
the commonplace adventures of a priggish little boy and his companions; and straightway the
whole dreary and disastrous army of sectarians and dogmatists took up the cry, and have been
ringing the lugubrious changes on it ever since. There is really no estimating the mortal wrong
that has been done to childhood by Maria Edgeworth's "Frank" and "The Parent's Assistant";
and, for my part, I derive a melancholy joy in availing myself of this opportunity to express
my sense of my personal share in the injury. I believe that my affection for the human race
is as genuine as the average; but I am sure it would have been greater had Miss Edgeworth never
been born; and were I to come across any philosophical system whereby I could persuade myself
that she belonged to some other order of beings than the human, I should be strongly tempted
to embrace that system on that ground alone.

After what has been advanced in the preceding pages, it does not need that I should state how
earnestly I deprecate the kind of literary food which we are now furnishing to the coming generation
in such sinister abundance. I am sure it is written and published with good and honorable motives;
but at the very best it can only do no harm. Moreover, however well intentioned, it is bad
as literature; it is poorly conceived and written, and, what is worse, it is saturated with
affectation. For an impression prevails that one needs to talk down to children;--to keep them
constantly reminded that they are innocent, ignorant little things, whose consuming wish it
is to be good and go to Sunday-school, and who will be all gratitude and docility to whomsoever
provides them with the latest fashion of moral sugarplums; whereas, so far as my experience
and information goes, children are the most formidable literary critics in the world. Matthew
Arnold himself has not so sure an instinct for what is sound and good in a book as any intelligent
little boy or girl of eight years old. They judge absolutely; they are hampered by no comparisons
or relative considerations. They cannot give chapter and verse for their opinion; but about
the opinion itself there is no doubt. They have no theories; they judge in a white light. They
have no prejudices nor traditions; they come straight from the simple source of life. But,
on the other hand, they are readily hocussed and made morbid by improper drugs, and presently,
no doubt, lose their appetite for what is wholesome. Now, we cannot hope that an army of hermetic
philosophers or Mother-Gooses will arise at need and remedy all abuses; but at least we might
refrain from moralizing and instruction, and, if we can do nothing more, confine ourselves
to plain stories of adventure, say, with no ulterior object whatever. There still remains the
genuine literature of the past to draw upon; but let us beware, as we would of forgery and
perjury, of serving it up, as has been done too often, medicated and modified to suit the foolish
dogmatism of the moment. Hans Christian Andersen was the last writer of children's stories,
properly so called; though, considering how well married to his muse he was, it is a wonder
as well as a calamity that he left no descendants.

CHAPTER V.

THE MORAL AIM IN FICTION.

The producers of modern fiction, who have acquiesced more or less completely in the theory
of art for art's sake, are not, perhaps, aware that a large class of persons still exist who
hold fiction to be unjustifiable, save in so far as the author has it at heart not only (or
chiefly) to adorn the tale, but also (and first of all) to point the moral. The novelist, in
other words, should so mould the characters and shape the plot of his imaginary drama as to
vindicate the wisdom and integrity of the Decalogue: if he fail to do this, or if he do the
opposite of this, he deserves not the countenance of virtuous and God- fearing persons.

Doubtless it should be evident to every sane and impartial mind, whether orthodox or agnostic,
that an art which runs counter to the designs of God toward the human race, or to the growth
of the sentiment of universal human brotherhood, must sooner or later topple down from its
fantastic and hollow foundation. "Hitch your wagon to a star," says Emerson; "do not lie and
steal: no god will help." And although, for the sake of his own private interests of the moment,
a man will occasionally violate the moral law, yet, with mankind at large, the necessity of
vindicating the superior advantages of right over wrong is acknowledged not only in the interests
of civilized society, but because we feel that, however hostile "goodness" may seem to be to
my or your personal and temporary aims, it still remains the only wholesome and handsome choice
for the race at large: and therefore do we, as a race, refuse to tolerate--on no matter how
plausible an artistic plea--any view of human life which either professes indifference to this
universal sentiment, or perversely challenges it.

The true ground of dispute, then, does not lie here. The art which can stoop to be "procuress
to the lords of hell," is art no longer. But, on the other hand, it would be difficult to point
to any great work of art, generally acknowledged to be such, which explicitly concerns itself
with the vindication of any specific moral doctrine. The story in which the virtuous are rewarded
for their virtue, and the evil punished for their wickedness, fails, somehow, to enlist our
full sympathy; it falls flatly on the ear of the mind; it does not stimulate thought. It does
not satisfy; we fancy that something still remains to be said, or, if this be all, then it
was hardly worth saying. The real record of life--its terror, its beauty, its pathos, its depth--seems
to have been missed. We may admit that the tale is in harmony with what we have been taught
ought to happen; but the lessons of our private experience have not authenticated our moral
formulas; we have seen the evil exalted and the good brought low; and we inevitably desire
that our "fiction" shall tell us, not what ought to happen, but what, as a matter of fact,
does happen. To put this a little differently: we feel that the God of the orthodox moralist
is not the God of human nature. He is nothing but the moralist himself in a highly sublimated
state, but betraying, in spite of that sublimation, a fatal savor of human personality. The
conviction that any man--George Washington, let us say--is a morally unexceptionable man, does
not in the least reconcile us to the idea of God being an indefinitely exalted counterpart
of Washington. Such a God would be "most tolerable, and not to be endured"; and the more exalted
he was, the less endurable would he be. In short, man instinctively refuses to regard the literal
inculcation of the Decalogue as the final word of God to the human race, and much less to the
individuals of that race; and when he finds a story-teller proceeding upon the contrary assumption,
he is apt to put that story-teller down as either an ass or a humbug.

As for art--if the reader happen to be competent to form an opinion on that phase of the matter--he
will generally find that the art dwindles in direct proportion as the moralized deity expatiates;
in fact, that they are incompatible. And he will also confess (if he have the courage of his
opinions) that, as between moralized deity and true art, his choice is heartily and unreservedly
for the latter.

I do not apprehend that the above remarks, fairly interpreted, will encounter serious opposition
from either party to the discussion; and yet, so far as I am aware, neither party has as yet
availed himself of the light which the conclusion throws upon the nature of art itself. It
should be obvious, however, that upon a true definition of art the whole argument must ultimately
hinge: for we can neither deny that art exists, nor affirm that it can exist inconsistently
with a recognition of a divinely beneficent purpose in creation. It must, therefore, in some
way be an expression or reflection of that purpose. But in what does the purpose in question
essentially consist?

Broadly speaking--for it would be impossible within the present limits to attempt a full analysis
of the subject--it may be considered as a gradual and progressive Purification, not of this
or that particular individual in contradistinction to his fellows, but of human nature as an
entirety. The evil into which all men are born, and of which the Decalogue, or conscience,
makes us aware, is not an evil voluntarily contracted on our part, but is inevitable to us
as the creation of a truly infinite love and wisdom. It is, in fact, our characteristic nature
as animals: and it is only because we are not only animal, but also and above all human, that
we are enabled to recognize it as evil instead of good. We absolve the cat, the dog, the wolf,
and the lion from any moral responsibility for their deeds, because we feel them to be deficient
in conscience, which, is our own divinely bestowed gift and privilege, and which has been defined
as the spirit of God in the created nature, seeking to become the creature's own spirit. Now,
the power to correct this evil does not abide in us as individuals, nor will a literal adherence
to the moral law avail to purify any mother's son of us. Conscience always says "Do not,"--never
"Do"; and obedience to it neither can give us a personal claim on God's favor nor was it intended
to do so: its true function is to keep us innocent, so that we may not individually obstruct
the accomplishment of the divine ends toward us as a race. Our nature not being the private
possession of any one of us, but the impersonal substratum of us all, it follows that it cannot
be redeemed piecemeal, but only as a whole; and, manifestly, the only Being capable of effecting
such redemption is not Peter, or Paul, or George Washington, or any other atomic exponent of
that nature, be he who he may; but He alone whose infinitude is the complement of our finiteness,
and whose gradual descent into human nature (figured in Scripture under the symbol of the Incarnation)
is even now being accomplished--as any one may perceive who reads aright the progressive enlightenment
of conscience and intellect which history, through many vicissitudes, displays. We find, therefore,
that art is, essentially, the imaginative expression of a divine life in man. Art depends for
its worth and veracity, not upon its adherence to literal fact, but upon its perception and
portrayal of the underlying truth, of which fact is but the phenomenal and imperfect shadow.
And it can have nothing to do with personal vice or virtue, in the way either of condemning
the one or vindicating the other; it can only treat them as elements in its picture--as factors
in human destiny. For the notion commonly entertained that the practice of virtue gives us
a claim upon the Divine Exchequer (so to speak), and the habit of acting virtuously for the
sake of maintaining our credit in society, and ensuring our prosperity in the next world,--in
so thinking and acting we misapprehend the true inwardness of the matter. To cultivate virtue
because its pays, no matter what the sort of coin in which payment is looked for, is to be
the victims of a lamentable delusion. For such virtue makes each man jealous of his neighbor;
whereas the aim of Providence is to bring about the broadest human fellowship. A man's physical
body separates him from other men; and this fact disposes him to the error that his nature
is also a separate possession, and that he can only be "good" by denying himself. But the only
goodness that is really good is a spontaneous and impersonal evolution, and this occurs, not
where self- denial has been practised, but only where a man feels himself to be absolutely
on the same level of desert or non-desert as are the mass of his fellow-creatures. There is
no use in obeying the commandments, unless it be done, not to make one's self more deserving
than another of God's approbation, but out of love for goodness and truth in themselves, apart
from any personal considerations. The difference between true religion and formal religion
is that the first leads us to abandon all personal claims to salvation, and to care only for
the salvation of humanity as a whole; whereas the latter stimulates is to practise outward
self-denial, in order that our real self may be exalted. Such self-denial results not in humility,
but in spiritual pride.

In no other way than this, it seems to me, can art and morality be brought into harmony. Art
bears witness to the presence in us of something purer and loftier than anything of which we
can be individually conscious. Its complete expression we call inspiration; and he who is the
subject of the inspiration can account no better than any one else for the result which art
accomplishes through him. The perfect poem is found, not made; the mind which utters it did
not invent it. Art takes all nature and all knowledge for her province; but she does not leave
it as she found it; by the divine necessity that is upon her, she breathes a soul into her
materials, and organizes chaos into form. But never, under any circumstances, does she deign
to minister to our selfish personal hope or greed. She shows us how to love our neighbor, never
ourselves. Shakspeare, Homer, Phidias, Raphael, were no Pharisees--at least in so far as they
were artists; nor did any one ever find in their works any countenance for that inhuman assumption--"I
am holier than thou!" In the world's darkest hours, art has sometimes stood as the sole witness
of the nobler life that was in eclipse. Civilizations arise and vanish; forms of religion hold
sway and are forgotten; learning and science advance and gather strength; but true art was
as great and as beautiful three thousand years ago as it is to-day. We are prone to confound
the man with the artist, and to suppose that he is artistic by possession and inheritance,
instead of exclusively by dint of what he does. No artist worthy the name ever dreams of putting
himself into his work, but only what is infinitely distinct from and other than himself. It
is not the poet who brings forth the poem, but the poem that begets the poet; it makes him,
educates him, creates in him the poetic faculty. Those whom we call great men, the heroes of
history, are but the organs of great crises and opportunities: as Emerson has said, they are
the most indebted men. In themselves they are not great; there is no ratio between their achievements
and them. Our judgment is misled; we do not discriminate between the divine purpose and the
human instrument. When we listen to Napoleon fretting his soul away at Elba, or to Carlyle
wrangling with his wife at Chelsea, we are shocked at the discrepancy between the lofty public
performance and the petty domestic shortcoming. Yet we do wrong to blame them; the nature of
which they are examples is the same nature that is shared also by the publican and the sinner.

Instead, therefore, of saying that art should be moral, we should rather say that all true
morality is art--that art is the test of morality. To attempt to make this heavenly Pegasus
draw the sordid plough of our selfish moralistic prejudices is a grotesque subversion of true
order. Why should the novelist make believe that the wicked are punished and the good are rewarded
in this world? Does he not know, on the contrary, that whatsoever is basest in our common life
tends irresistibly to the highest places, and that the selfish element in our nature is on
the side of public order? Evil is at present a more efficient instrument of order (because
an interested one) than good; and the novelist who makes this appear will do a far greater
and more lasting benefit to humanity than he who follows the cut-and-dried artificial programme
of bestowing crowns on the saint and whips of scorpions on the sinner.

As a matter of fact, I repeat, the best influences of the best literature have never been didactic,
and there is no reason to believe they ever will be. The only semblance of didacticism which
can enter into literature is that which conveys such lessons as may be learned from sea and
sky, mountain and valley, wood and stream, bird and beast; and from the broad human life of
races, nations, and firesides; a lesson that is not obvious and superficial, but so profoundly
hidden in the creative depths as to emerge only to an apprehension equally profound. For the
chatter and affectation of sense disturb and offend that inward spiritual ear which, in the
silent recesses of meditation, hears the prophetic murmur of the vast ocean of human nature
that flows within us and around us all.

CHAPTER VI.

THE MAKER OF MANY BOOKS.

During the winter of 1879, when I was in London, it was my fortune to attend, a social meeting
of literary men at the rooms of a certain eminent publisher. The rooms were full of tobacco-smoke
and talk, amid which were discernible, on all sides, the figures and faces of men more or less
renowned in the world of books. Most noticeable among these personages was a broad-shouldered,
sturdy man, of middle height, with a ruddy countenance, and snow-white tempestuous beard and
hair. He wore large, gold-rimmed spectacles, but his eyes were black and brilliant, and looked
at his interlocutor with a certain genial fury of inspection. He seemed to be in a state of
some excitement; he spoke volubly and almost boisterously, and his voice was full-toned and
powerful, though pleasant to the ear. He turned himself, as he spoke, with a burly briskness,
from one side to another, addressing himself first to this auditor and then to that, his words
bursting forth from beneath his white moustache with such an impetus of hearty breath that
it seemed as if all opposing arguments must be blown quite away. Meanwhile he flourished in
the air an ebony walking-stick, with much vigor of gesticulation, and narrowly missing, as
it appeared, the pates of his listeners. He was clad in evening dress, though the rest of the
company was, for the most part, in mufti; and he was an exceedingly fine-looking old gentleman.
At the first glance, you would have taken him to be some civilized and modernized Squire Western,
nourished with beef and ale, and roughly hewn out of the most robust and least refined variety
of human clay. Looking at him more narrowly, however, you would have reconsidered this judgment.
Though his general contour and aspect were massive and sturdy, the lines of his features were
delicately cut; his complexion was remarkably pure and fine, and his face was susceptible of
very subtle and sensitive changes of expression. Here was a man of abundant physical strength
and vigor, no doubt, but carrying within him a nature more than commonly alert and impressible.
His organization, though thoroughly healthy, was both complex and high- wrought; his character
was simple and straightforward to a fault, but he was abnormally conscientious, and keenly
alive to others' opinion concerning him. It might be thought that he was overburdened with
self- esteem, and unduly opinionated; but, in fact, he was but overanxious to secure the good-will
and agreement of all with whom he came in contact. There was some peculiarity in him--some
element or bias in his composition that made him different from other men; but, on the other
hand, there was an ardent solicitude to annul or reconcile this difference, and to prove himself
to be, in fact, of absolutely the same cut and quality as all the rest of the world. Hence
he was in a demonstrative, expository, or argumentative mood; he could not sit quiet in the
face of a divergence between himself and his associates; he was incorrigibly strenuous to obliterate
or harmonize the irreconcilable points between him and others; and since these points remained
irreconcilable, he remained in a constant state of storm and stress on the subject.

It was impossible to help liking such a man at first sight; and I believe that no man in London
society was more generally liked than Anthony Trollope. There was something pathetic in his
attitude as above indicated; and a fresh and boyish quality always invested him. His artlessness
was boyish, and so were his acuteness and his transparent but somewhat belated good-sense.
He was one of those rare persons who not only have no reserves, but who can afford to dispense
with them. After he had shown you all he had in him, you would have seen nothing that was not
gentlemanly, honest, and clean. He was a quick-tempered man, and the ardor and hurry of his
temperament made him seem more so than he really was; but he was never more angry than he was
forgiving and generous. He was hurt by little things, and little things pleased him; he was
suspicious and perverse, but in a manner that rather endeared him to you than otherwise. Altogether,
to a casual acquaintance, who knew nothing of his personal history, he was something of a paradox--an
entertaining contradiction. The publication of his autobiography explained many things in his
character that were open to speculation; and, indeed, the book is not only the most interesting
and amusing that its author has ever written, but it places its subject before the reader more
completely and comprehensively than most autobiographies do. This, however, is due much less
to any direct effort or intention on the writer's part, than to the unconscious self-revelation
which meets the reader on every page. No narrative could be simpler, less artificial; and yet,
everywhere, we read between the lines, and, so to speak, discover Anthony Trollope in spite
of his efforts to discover himself to us.

The truth appears to be that the youthful Trollope, like a more famous fellow-novelist, began
the world with more kicks than half-pence. His boyhood, he affirms, was as unhappy as that
of a young gentleman could well be, owing to a mixture of poverty and gentle standing on his
father's part, and, on his own, to "an utter lack of juvenile manhood"--whatever that may be.
His father was a lawyer, who frightened away all his clients by his outrageous temper, and
who encountered one mischance after another until he landed himself and his family in open
bankruptcy; from which they were rescued, partly by death, which carried away four of them
(including the old gentleman), and partly by Mrs. Trollope, who, at fifty years of age, brought
out her famous book on America, and continued to make a fair income by literature (as she called
it) until 1856, when, being seventy- six years old, and having produced one hundred and fourteen
volumes, she permitted herself to retire. This extraordinary lady, in her youth, cherished
what her son calls "an emotional dislike to tyrants"; but when her American experience had
made her acquainted with some of the seamy aspects of democracy, and especially after the aristocracy
of her own country had begun to patronize her, she confessed the error of her early way, "and
thought that archduchesses were sweet." But she was certainly a valiant and indefatigable woman,--"of
all the people I have ever known," says her son, "the most joyous, or, at any rate, the most
capable of joy"; and he adds that her best novels were written in 1834-35, when her husband
and four of her six children were dying upstairs of consumption, and she had to divide her
time between nursing them and writing. Assuredly, no son of hers need apprehend the reproach--"Tydides
melior matre"; though Anthony, and his brother Thomas Adolphus, must, together, have run her
pretty hard. The former remarks, with that terrible complacency in an awful fact which is one
of his most noticeable and astounding traits, that the three of them "wrote more books than
were probably ever before produced by a single family." The existence of a few more such families
could be consistent only with a generous enlargement of the British Museum.

The elder Trollope was a scholar, and to make scholars of his sons was one of his ruling ideas.
Poor little Anthony endured no less than twelve mortal years of schooling--from the time he
was seven until he was nineteen--and declares that, in all that time, he does not remember
that he ever knew a lesson. "I have been flogged," he says, "oftener than any other human being."
Nay, his troubles began before his school-days; for his father used to make him recite his
infantile tasks to him while he was shaving, and obliged him to sit with his head inclined
in such a manner "that he could pull my hair without stopping his razor or dropping his shaving-brush."
This is a depressing picture; and there are plenty more like it. Dr. Butler, the master of
Harrow, meeting the poor little draggletail urchin in the yard, desired to know, in awful accents,
how so dirty a boy dared to show himself near the school! "He must have known me, had he seen
me as he was wont to see me, for he was in the habit of flogging me constantly. Perhaps," adds
his victim, "he did not recognize me by my face!" But it is comforting to learn, in another
place, that justice overtook the oppressor. "Dr. Butler only lived to be Dean of Peterborough;
but his successor (Dr. Longley) became Archbishop of Canterbury." There is a great deal of
Trollopian morality in the fate of these two men, the latter of whom "could not have said anything
ill- natured if he had tried."

Black care, however, continued to sit behind the horseman with harrowing persistence. A certain
Dr. Drury (another schoolmaster) punished him on suspicion of "some nameless horror," of which
the unfortunate youngster happened to be innocent. When, afterward, the latter fact began to
be obvious, "he whispered to me half a word that perhaps he had been wrong. But, with a boy's
stupid slowness, I said nothing, and he had not the courage to carry reparation farther." The
poverty of Anthony's father deprived the boy of all the external advantages that might have
enabled him to take rank with his fellows: and his native awkwardness and sensitiveness widened
the breach. "I had no friend to whom I could pour out my sorrows. I was big, awkward and ugly,
and, I have no doubt, skulked about in a most unattractive manner. Something of the disgrace
of my school-days has clung to me all through life. When I have been claimed as school-fellow
by some of those many hundreds who were with me either at Harrow or at Winchester, I have felt
that I had no right to talk of things from most of which I was kept in estrangement. I was
never a coward, but to make a stand against three hundred tyrants required a moral courage
which I did not possess." Once, however, they pushed him too far, and he was driven to rebellion.
"And then came a great fight--at the end of which my opponent had to be taken home to be cured."
The lonely, lugubrious little champion! One would almost have been willing to have received
from him a black eye and a bloody nose, only to comfort his sad heart. It is delightful to
imagine the terrific earnestness of that solitary victory: and I would like to know what boy
it was (if any) who lent the unpopular warrior a knee and wiped his face.

After he got through his school-days, his family being then abroad, he had an offer of a commission
in an Austrian cavalry regiment; and he might have been a major-general or field-marshal at
this day had his schooling made him acquainted with the French and German languages. Being,
however, entirely ignorant of these, he was obliged to study them in order to his admission;
and while he was thus employed, he received news of a vacant clerkship in the General Post-Office,
with the dazzling salary of L90 a year. Needless to say that he jumped at such an opening,
seeing before him a vision of a splendid civil and social career, at something over twenty
pounds a quarter. But London, even fifty years ago, was a more expensive place than Anthony
imagined. Moreover, the boy was alone in the wilderness of the city, with no one to advise
or guide him. The consequence was that these latter days of his youth were as bad or worse
than the beginning. In reviewing his plight at this period, he observes: "I had passed my life
where I had seen gay things, but had never enjoyed them. There was no house in which I could
habitually see a lady's face or hear a lady's voice. At the Post-Office I got credit for nothing,
and was reckless. I hated my work, and, more than all, I hated my idleness. Borrowings of money,
sometimes absolute want, and almost constant misery, followed as a matter of course. Even my
few friends were half-ashamed of me. I acknowledge the weakness of a great desire to be loved--a
strong wish to be popular. No one had ever been less so." Under these circumstances, he remarks
that, although, no doubt, if the mind be strong enough, the temptation will not prevail, yet
he is fain to admit that the temptation prevailed with him. He did not sit at home, after his
return from the office, in the evening, to drink tea and read, but tramped out in the streets,
and tried to see life and be jolly on L90 a year. He borrowed four pounds of a money-lender,
to augment his resources, and found, after a few years, that he had paid him two hundred pounds
for the accommodation. He met with every variety of absurd and disastrous adventure. The mother
of a young woman with whom he had had an innocent flirtation in the country appeared one day
at his desk in the office, and called out before all the clerks, "Anthony Trollope, when are
you going to marry my daughter?" On another occasion a sum of money was missing from the table
of the director. Anthony was summoned. The director informed him of the loss--"and, by G--!"
he continued, thundering his fist down on the table, "no one has been in the room but you and
I." "Then, by G--!" cried Anthony, thundering his fist down upon something, "you have taken
it!" This was very well; but the thing which Anthony had thumped happened to be, not a table,
but a movable desk with an inkstand on it, and the ink flew up and deluged the face and shirt-front
of the enraged director. Still another adventure was that of the Queen of Saxony and the Half-
Crown; but the reader must investigate these matters for himself.

So far there has been nothing looking toward the novel-writer. But now we learn that from the
age of fifteen to twenty-six Anthony kept a journal, which, he says, "convicted me of folly,
ignorance, indiscretion, idleness, and conceit, but habituated me to the rapid use of pen and
ink, and taught me how to express myself with facility." In addition to this, and more to the
purpose, he had formed an odd habit. Living, as he was forced to do, so much to himself, if
not by himself, he had to play, not with other boys, but with himself; and his favorite play
was to conceive a tale, or series of fictitious events, and to carry it on, day after day,
for months together, in his mind. "Nothing impossible was ever introduced, or violently improbable.
I was my own hero, but I never became a king or a duke, still less an Antinous, or six feet
high. But I was a very clever person, and beautiful young women used to be very fond of me.
I learned in this way to live in a world outside the world of my own material life." This is
pointedly, even touchingly, characteristic. Never, to the day of his death, did Mr. Trollope
either see or imagine anything impossible, or violently improbable, in the world. This mortal
plane of things never dissolved before his gaze and revealed the mysteries of absolute Being;
his heavens were never rolled up as a scroll, and his earth had no bubbles as the water hath.
He took things as he found them; and he never found them out. But if the light that never was
on sea or land does not illuminate the writings of Mr. Trollope, there is generally plenty
of that other kind of light with which, after all, the average reader is more familiar, and
which not a few, perhaps, prefer to the transcendental lustre. There is no modern novelist
who has more clearly than Trollope defined to his own apprehension his own literary capabilities
and limitations. He is thoroughly acquainted with both his fortes and his foibles; and so sound
is his good sense, that he is seldom beguiled into toiling with futile ambition after effects
that are beyond him. His proper domain is a sufficiently wide one; he is inimitably at home
here; and when he invites us there to visit him, we may be sure of getting good and wholesome
entertainment. The writer's familiarity with his characters communicates itself imperceptibly
to the reader; there are no difficult or awkward introductions; the toning of the picture (to
use the painter's phrase) is unexceptionable; and if it be rather tinted than colored, the
tints are handled in a workmanlike manner. Again, few English novelists seem to possess so
sane a comprehension of the modes of life and thought of the British aristocracy as Trollope.
He has not only made a study of them from the observer's point of view, but he has reasoned
them out intellectually. The figures are not vividly defined; the realism is applied to events
rather than to personages: we have the scene described for us but we do not look upon it. We
should not recognize his characters if we saw them; but if we were told who they were, we should
know, from their author's testimony, what were their characteristic traits and how they would
act under given circumstances. The logical sequence of events is carefully maintained; nothing
happens, either for good or for evil, other than might befall under the dispensations of a
Providence no more unjust, and no more far-sighted, than Trollope himself. There is a good
deal of the a priori principle in his method; he has made up his mind as to certain fundamental
data, and thence develops or explains whatever complication comes up for settlement. But to
range about unhampered by any theories, concerned only to examine all phenomena, and to report
thereupon, careless of any considerations save those of artistic propriety, would have been
vanity and striving after wind to Trollope, and derivatively so, doubtless, to his readers.

Considered in the abstract, it is a curious question what makes his novels interesting. The
reader knows, in a sense, just what is in store for him, --or, rather, what is not. There will
be no astonishment, no curdling horror, no consuming suspense. There may be, perhaps, as many
murders, forgeries, foundlings, abductions, and missing wills, in Trollope's novels as in any
others; but they are not told about in a manner to alarm us; we accept them philosophically;
there are paragraphs in our morning paper that excite us more. And yet they are narrated with
art, and with dramatic effect. They are interesting, but not uncourteously--not exasperatingly
so; and the strangest part of it is that the introductory and intermediate passages are no
less interesting, under Trollope's treatment, than are the murders and forgeries. Not only
does he never offend the modesty of nature,--he encourages her to be prudish, and trains her
to such evenness and severity of demeanor that we never know when we have had enough of her.
His touch is eminently civilizing; everything, from the episodes to the sentences, moves without
hitch or creak: we never have to read a paragraph twice, and we are seldom sorry to have read
it once.

Amusingly characteristic of Trollope is his treatment of his villains. His attitude toward
them betrays no personal uncharitableness or animosity, but the villain has a bad time of it
just the same. Trollope places upon him a large, benevolent, but unyielding forefinger, and
says to us: "Remark, if you please, how this inferior reptile squirms when pressure is applied
to him. I will now augment the pressure. You observe that the squirmings increase in energy
and complexity. Now, if you please, I will bear down yet a little harder. Do not be alarmed,
madam; the reptile undoubtedly suffers, but the spectacle may do us some good, and you may
trust me not to let him do you any harm. There!--Yes, evisceration by means of pressure is
beyond question painful; but every one must have observed the benevolence of my forefinger
during the operation; and I fancy even the subject of the experiment (were he in a condition
to express his sentiments) would have admitted as much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I
shall have the pleasure of meeting you again very shortly. John, another reptile, please!"
Upon the whole, it is much to Trollope's credit that he wrote somewhere about fifty long novels;
and to the credit of the English people that they paid him three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars for these novels--and read them!

But his success as a man of letters was still many years in the future. After seven years in
the London office, he went to Ireland as assistant surveyor, and thenceforward he began to
enjoy his business, and to get on in it. He was paid sixpence a mile, and he would ride forty
miles a day. He rode to hounds, incidentally, whenever he got a chance, and he kept up the
practice, with enthusiasm, to within a few years of his death. "It will, I think, be accorded
to me," he says, "that I have ridden hard. Riding, working, having a jolly time, and gradually
increasing his income, he lived until 1842, when he became engaged; and he was married on June
11, 1844. "I ought to name that happy day," he declares, "as the commencement of my better
life." It was at about this date, also, that he began and finished, not without delay and procrastination,
his first novel. Curiously enough, he affirms that he did not doubt his own intellectual sufficiency
to write a readable novel: "What I did doubt was my own industry, and the chances of a market."
Never, surely, was self-distrust more unfounded. As for the first novel, he sent it to his
mother, to dispose of as best she could; and it never brought him anything, except a perception
that it was considered by his friends to be "an unfortunate aggravation of the family disease."
During the ensuing ten years, this view seemed to be not unreasonable, for, in all that time,
though he worked hard, he earned by literature no more than L55. But, between 1857 and 1860,
he received for various novels, from L100 to L1000 each; and thereafter, L3000 or more was
his regular price for a story in three volumes. As he maintained his connection with the post-
office until 1867, he was in receipt of an income of L4500, "of which I spent two-thirds and
put by one." We should be doing an injustice to Mr. Trollope to omit these details, which he
gives so frankly; for, as he early informs us, "my first object in taking to literature was
to make an income on which I and those belonging to me might live in comfort." Nor will he
let us forget that novel-writing, to him, was not so much an art, or even a profession, as
a trade, in which all that can be asked of a man is that he shall be honest and punctual, turning
out good average work, and the more the better. "The great secret consists in"--in what?--why,
"in acknowledging myself to be bound to rules of labor similar to those which an artisan or
mechanic is forced to obey." There may be, however, other incidental considerations. Again--
"The novelist must please, and he must teach; a good novel should be both realistic and sensational
in the highest degree." He says that he sees no reason why two or three good novels should
not be written at the same time; and that, for his own part, he was accustomed to write two
hundred and fifty words every fifteen minutes, by the watch, during his working hours. Nor
does he mind letting us know that when he sits down to write a novel, he neither knows nor
cares how it is to end. And finally, one is a little startled to hear him say, epigrammatically,
that a writer should not have to tell a story, but should have a story to tell. Beyond a doubt,
Anthony Trollope is something of a paradox.

The world has long ago passed its judgment on his stories, but it is interesting, all the same,
to note his own opinion of them; and though never arrogant, he is generally tolerant, if not
genial. "A novel should be a picture of common life, enlivened by humor and sweetened by pathos.
I have never fancied myself to be a man of genius," he says; but again, with strange imperviousness,
"A small daily task, if it be daily, will beat the labors of a spasmodic Hercules." Beat them,
how? Why, in quantity. But how about quality? Is the travail of a work of art the same thing
as the making of a pair of shoes?

No one disputes, however, that you may hear the tapping of the cobbler's hammer at any time.

To the view of the present writer, how much good soever Mr. Trollope may have done as a preacher
and moralist, he has done great harm to English fictitious literature by his novels; and it
need only be added, in this connection, that his methods and results in novel-writing seem
best to be explained by that peculiar mixture of separateness and commonplaceness which we
began by remarking in him. The separateness has given him the standpoint whence he has been
able to observe and describe the commonplaceness with which (in spite of his separateness)
he is in vital sympathy.

But Trollope the man is the abundant and consoling compensation for Trollope the novelist;
and one wishes that his books might have died, and he lived on indefinitely. It is charming
to read of his life in London after his success in the Cornhill Magazine. "Up to that time
I had lived very little among men. It was a festival to me to dine at the 'Garrick.' I think
I became popular among those with whom I associated. I have ever wished to be liked by those
around me--a wish that during the first half of my life was never gratified." And, again, in
summing up his life, he says: "I have betrayed no woman. Wine has brought to me no sorrow.
It has been the companionship, rather than the habit of smoking that I loved. I will not say
that I have never scorched a finger; but I carry no ugly wounds."

A man who, at the end of his career, could make such a profession as this --who felt the need
of no further self-vindication than this--such a man, whatever may have been his accountability
to the muse of Fiction, is a credit to England and to human nature, and deserves to be numbered
among the darlings of mankind.

CHAPTER VII.

MR. MALLOCK'S MISSING SCIENCE.

Before criticising Mr. Mallock's little essay, let us summarize its contents. The author begins
with an analysis of the aims, the principles, and the "pseudo-science" of modern Democracy.
Having established the evil and destructive character of these things, he sets himself to show
by logical argument that the present state of social inequality, which Democrats wish to disturb,
is a natural and wholesome state; that the continuance of civilization is dependent upon it;
and that it could only be overturned by effecting a radical change--not in human institutions,
but in human character. The desire for inequality is inherent in the human character; and in
order to prove this statement, Mr. Mallock proceeds to affirm that there is such a thing as
a science of human character; that of this science he is the discoverer; and that the application
of this science to the question at issue will demonstrate the integrity of Mr. Mallock's views,
and the infirmity of all others. In the ensuing chapters the application is made, and at the
end the truth of the proposition is declared established.

This is the outline; but let us note some of the details. Mr. Mallock asserts (Chap. I.) that
the aim of modern Democracy is to overturn "all that has hitherto been connected with high-breeding
or with personal culture"; and that "to call the Democrats a set of thieves and confiscators
is merely to apply names to them which they have no wish to repudiate." He maintains (Chap.
II.) that the first and foremost of the Democratic principles is "that the perfection of society
involves social equality"; and that "the luxury of one man means the deprivation of another."
He credits the Democrats with arguing that "the means of producing equality are a series of
changes in existing institutions"; that "by changing the institutions of a society we are able
to change its structure"; that "the cause of the distribution of wealth" is "laws and forms
of government"; and that "the wealthy classes, as such, are connected with wealth in no other
way but as the accidental appropriators of it." In his third chapter he tells us that "the
entire theory of modern Democracy ... depends on the doctrine that the cause of wealth is labor";
that Democrats believe we "may count on a man to labor, just as surely as we may count on a
man to eat"; that "the man who does not labor is supported by the man who does"; and that the
pseudo-science of modern Democracy "starts with the conception of man as containing in himself
a natural tendency to labor." And here Mr. Mallock's statement of his opponent's position ends.

In the fourth chapter we are brought within sight of "The Missing Substitute." "A man's character,"
we are told, "divides into his desires on the one hand, and his capacities on the other"; and
it is observed that "various as are men's desires and capacities, yet if talent and ambition
commanded no more than idleness and stupidity, all men practically would be idle and stupid."
"Men's capacities," we are reminded, "are practically unequal, because they develop their own
potential inequalities; they do this because they desire to place themselves in unequal external
circumstances,--which result the condition of society renders possible."

Coming now to the Science of Human Character itself, we find that it "asserts a permanent relationship
to exist between human character and social inequality"; and the author then proceeds at some
length to show how near Herbert Spencer, Buckle, and other social and economic philosophers,
came to stumbling over his missing science, and yet avoided doing so. Nevertheless, argues
Mr. Mallock, "if there be such a thing as a social science, or a science of history, there
must be also a science of biography"; and this science, though it "cannot show us how any special
man will act in the future," yet, if "any special action be given us, it can show us that it
was produced by a special motive; and conversely, that if the special motive be wanting, the
special action is sure to be wanting also." As an example how to distinguish between those
traits of human character which are available for scientific purposes, and those which are
not, Mr. Mallock instances a mob, which temporarily acts together for some given purpose: the
individual differences of character then "cancel out," and only points of agreement are left.
Proceeding to the sixth chapter, he applies himself to setting to rest the scruples of those
who find something cynical in the idea that the desire for Inequality is compatible with a
respectable form of human character. It is true, he says, that man does not live by bread alone;
but he denies that he means to say "that all human activity is motived by the desire for inequality";
he would assert that only "of all productive labor, except the lowest." The only actions independent
of the desire for inequality, however, are those performed in the name of art, science, philanthropy,
and religion; and even in these cases, so far as the actions are not motived by a desire for
inequality, they are not of productive use; and vice versa. In the remaining chapters, which
we must dismiss briefly, we meet with such statements as "labor has been produced by an artificial
creation of want of food, and by then supplying the want on certain conditions"; that "civilization
has always been begun by an oppressive minority"; that "progress depends on certain gifted
individuals," and therefore social equality would destroy progress; that inequality influences
production by existing as an object of desire and as a means of pressure; that the evils of
poverty are caused by want, not by inequality; and that, finally, equality is not the goal
of progress, but of retrogression; that inequality is not an accidental evil of civilization,
but the cause of its development; the distance of the poor from the rich is not the cause of
the former's poverty as distinct from riches, but of their civilized competence as distinct
from barbarism; and that the apparent changes in the direction of equality recorded in history,
have been, in reality, none other than "a more efficient arrangement of inequalities."

       *       *       *       *       *

Now, let us inquire what all this ingenious prattle about Inequality and the Science of Human
Character amounts to. What does Mr. Mallock expect? His book has been out six months, and still
Democracy exists. But does any such Democracy as he combats exist, or could it conceivably
exist? Have his investigations of the human character failed to inform him that one of the
strongest natural instincts of man's nature is immovably opposed to anything like an equal
distribution of existing wealth?--because whoever owns anything, if it be only a coat, wishes
to keep it; and that wish makes him aware that his fellow-man will wish to keep, and will keep
at all hazards, whatever things belong to him. What Democrats really desire is to enable all
men to have an equal chance to obtain wealth, instead of being, as is largely the case now,
hampered and kept down by all manner of legal and arbitrary restrictions. As for the "desire
for Inequality," it seems to exist chiefly in Mr. Mallock's imagination. Who does desire it?
Does the man who "strikes" for higher wages desire it? Let us see. A strike, to be successful,
must be not an individual act, but the act of a large body of men, all demanding the same thing--an
increase in wages. If they gain their end, no difference has taken place in their mutual position;
and their position in regard to their employers is altered only in that an approach has been
made toward greater equality with the latter. And so in other departments of human effort:
the aim, which the man who wishes to better his position sets before himself, is not to rise
head and shoulders above his equals, but to equal his superiors. And as to the Socialist schemes
for the reorganization of society, they imply, at most, a wish to see all men start fair in
the race of life, the only advantages allowed being not those of rank or station, but solely
of innate capacity. And the reason the Socialist desires this is, because he believes, rightly
or wrongly, that many inefficient men are, at present, only artificially protected from betraying
their inefficiency; and that many efficient men are only artificially prevented from showing
their efficiency; and that the fair start he proposes would not result in keeping all men on
a dead level, but would simply put those in command who had a genuine right to be there.

       *       *       *       *       *

But this is taxing Mr. Mallock too seriously: he has not written in earnest. But, as his uncle,
Mr. Froude, said, when reading "The New Republic,"--"The rogue is clever!" He has read a good
deal, he has an active mind, a smooth redundancy of expression, a talent for caricature, a
fondness for epigram and paradox, a useful shallowness, and an amusing impudence. He has no
practical knowledge of mankind, no experience of life, no commanding point of view, and no
depth of insight. He has no conception of the meaning and quality of the problems with whose
exterior aspects he so prettily trifles. He has constructed a Science of Human Character without
for one moment being aware that, for instance, human character and human nature are two distinct
things; and that, furthermore, the one is everything that the other is not. As little is he
conscious of the significance of the words "society" and "civilization"; nor can he explain
whether, or why, either of them is desirable or undesirable, good or bad. He has never done,
and (judging from his published works) we do not believe him capable of doing, any analytical
or constructive thinking; at most, as in the present volume, he turns a few familiar objects
upside down, and airily invites his audience to believe that he has thereby earned the name
of Discoverer, if not of Creator.

CHAPTER VIII.

THEODORE WINTHROP'S WRITINGS.

On an accessible book-shelf in my library, stand side by side four volumes whose contents I
once knew by heart, and which, after the lapse of twenty years, are yet tolerably distinct
in my memory. These are stoutly bound in purple muslin, with a stamp, of Persian design apparently,
on the centre of each cover. They are stained and worn, and the backs have faded to a brownish
hue, from exposure to the light, and a leaf in one of the volumes has been torn across; but
the paper and the sewing and the clear bold type are still as serviceable as ever. The books
seem to have been made to last,--to stand a great deal of reading. Contrasted with the aesthetically
designed covers one sees nowadays, they would be considered inexcusably ugly, and the least
popular novelist of our time would protest against having his lucubrations presented to the
public in such plain attire. Nevertheless, on turning to the title-pages, you may see imprinted,
on the first, "Fourteenth Edition"; on the second, "Twelfth Edition"; and on the others, indications
somewhat less magnificent, but still evidence of very exceptional circulation. The date they
bear is that of the first years of our civil war; and the first published of them is prefaced
by a biographical memoir of the author, written by his friend George William Curtis. This memoir
was originally printed in the Atlantic Monthly, two or three months after the death of its
subject, Theodore Winthrop.

For these books,--three novels, and one volume of records of travel,--came from his hand, though
they did not see the light until after he had passed beyond the sphere of authors and publishers.
At that time, the country was in an exalted and heroic mood, and the men who went to fight
its battles were regarded with a personal affection by no means restricted to their personal
acquaintances. Their names were on all lips, and those of them who fell were mourned by multitudes
instead of by individuals. Winthrop's historic name, and the influential position of some of
his nearest friends, would have sufficed to bring into unusual prominence his brief career
and his fate as a soldier, even had his intrinsic qualities and character been less honorable
and winning than they were. But he was a type of a young American such as America is proud
to own. He was high- minded, refined, gifted, handsome. I recollect a portrait of him published
soon after his death,--a photograph, I think, from a crayon drawing; an eloquent, sensitive,
rather melancholy, but manly and courageous face, with grave eyes, the mouth veiled by a long
moustache. It was the kind of countenance one would wish our young heroes to have. When, after
the catastrophe at Great Bethel, it became known that Winthrop had left writings behind him,
it would have been strange indeed had not every one felt a desire to read them.

Moreover, he had already begun to be known as a writer. It was during 1860, I believe, that
a story of his, in two instalments, entitled "Love on Skates," appeared in the "Atlantic."
It was a brilliant and graphic celebration of the art of skating, engrafted on a love-tale
as full of romance and movement as could be desired. Admirably told it was, as I recollect
it; crisp with the healthy vigor of American wintry atmosphere, with bright touches of humor,
and, here and there, passages of sentiment, half tender, half playful. It was something new
in our literature, and gave promise of valuable work to come. But the writer was not destined
to fulfil the promise. In the next year, from the camp of his regiment, he wrote one or two
admirable descriptive sketches, touching upon the characteristic points of the campaigning
life which had just begun; but, before the last of these had become familiar to the "Atlantic's"
readers, it was known that it would be the last. Theodore Winthrop had been killed.

He was only in his thirty-third year. He was born in New Haven, and had entered Yale College
with the class of '48. The Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity was, I believe, founded in the year
of his admission, and he must, therefore, have been among its earliest members. He was distinguished
as a scholar, and the traces of his classic and philosophical acquirements are everywhere visible
in his books. During the five or six years following his graduation, he travelled abroad, and
in the South and West; a wild frontier life had great attractions for him, as he who reads
"John Brent" and "The Canoe and the Saddle" need not be told. He tried his hand at various
things, but could settle himself to no profession,--an inability which would have excited no
remark in England, which has had time to recognize the value of men of leisure, as such; but
which seems to have perplexed some of his friends in this country. Be that as it may, no one
had reason to complain of lack of energy and promptness on his part when patriotism revealed
a path to Winthrop. He knew that the time for him had come; but he had also known that the
world is not yet so large that all men, at all times, can lay their hands upon the work that
is suitable for them to do.

Let us, however, return to the novels. They appear to have been written about 1856 and 1857,
when their author was twenty-eight or nine years old. Of the order in which they were composed
I have no record; but, judging from internal evidence, I should say that "Edwin Brothertoft"
came first, then "Cecil Dreeme," and then "John Brent." The style, and the quality of thought,
in the latter is more mature than in the others, and its tone is more fresh and wholesome.
In the order of publication, "Cecil Dreeme" was first, and seems also to have been most widely
read; then "John Brent," and then "Edwin Brothertoft," the scene of which was laid in the last
century. I remember seeing, at the house of James T. Fields, their publisher, the manuscripts
of these books, carefully bound and preserved. They were written on large ruled letter-paper,
and the handwriting was very large, and had a considerable slope. There were scarcely any corrections
or erasures; but it is possible that Winthrop made clean copies of his stories after composing
them. Much of the dialogue, especially, bears evidence of having been revised, and of the author's
having perhaps sacrificed ease and naturalness, here and there, to the craving for conciseness
which has been one of the chief stumbling-blocks in the way of our young writers. He wished
to avoid heaviness and "padding," and went to the other extreme. He wanted to cut loose from
the old, stale traditions of composition, and to produce something which should be new, not
only in character and significance, but in manner of presentation. He had the ambition of the
young Hafiz, who professed a longing to "tear down this tiresome old sky." But the old sky
has good reasons for being what and where it is, and young radicals finally come to perceive
that, regarded from the proper point of view, and in the right spirit, it is not so tiresome
after all. Divine Revelation itself can be expressed in very moderate and commonplace language;
and if one's thoughts are worth thinking, they are worth clothing in adequate and serene attire.

But "culture," and literature with it, have made such surprising advances of late, that we
are apt to forget how really primitive and unenlightened the generation was in which Winthrop
wrote. Imagine a time when Mr. Henry James, Jr., and Mr. W. D. Howells had not been heard of;
when Bret Harte was still hidden below the horizon of the far West; when no one suspected that
a poet named Aldrich would ever write a story called "Marjorie Daw"; when, in England, "Adam
Bede" and his successors were unborn;--a time of antiquity so remote, in short, that the mere
possibility of a discussion upon the relative merit of the ideal and the realistic methods
of fiction was undreamt of! What had an unfortunate novelist of those days to fall back upon?
Unless he wished to expatriate himself, and follow submissively in the well worn steps of Dickens,
Thackeray, and Trollope, the only models he could look to were Washington Irving, Edgar Allan
Foe, James Fenimore Cooper, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. "Elsie Venner" had scarcely made its appearance
at that date. Irving and Cooper were, on the other hand, somewhat antiquated. Poe and Hawthorne
were men of very peculiar genius, and, however deep the impression they have produced on our
literature, they have never had, because they never can have, imitators. As for the author
of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," she was a woman in the first place, and, in the second place, she sufficiently
filled the field she had selected. A would-be novelist, therefore, possessed of ambition, and
conscious of not being his own father or grandfather, saw an untrodden space before him, into
which he must plunge without support and without guide. No wonder if, at the outset, he was
a trifle awkward and ill-at-ease, and, like a raw recruit under fire, appeared affected from
the very desire he felt to look unconcerned. It is much to his credit that he essayed the venture
at all; and it is plain to be seen that, with each forward step he took, his self- possession
and simplicity increased. If time had been given him, there is no reason to doubt that he might
have been standing at the head of our champions of fiction to-day.

But time was not given him, and his work, like all other work, if it is to be judged at all,
must be judged on its merits. He excelled most in passages descriptive of action; and the more
vigorous and momentous the action, the better, invariably, was the description; he rose to
the occasion, and was not defeated by it. Partly for this reason, "Cecil Dreeme," the most
popular of his books, seems to me the least meritorious of them all. The story has little movement;
it stagnates round Chrysalis College. The love intrigue is morbid and unwholesome, and the
characters (which are seldom Winthrop's strong point) are more than usually artificial and
unnatural. The dramatis personae are, indeed, little more than moral or immoral principles
incarnate. There is no growth in them, no human variableness or complexity; it is "Every Man
in his Humor" over again, with the humor left out. Densdeth is an impossible rascal; Churm,
a scarcely more possible Rhadamanthine saint. Cecil Dreeme herself never fully recovers from
the ambiguity forced upon her by her masculine attire; and Emma Denman could never have been
both what we are told she was, and what she is described as being. As for Robert Byng, the
supposed narrator of the tale, his name seems to have been given him in order wantonly to increase
the confusion caused by the contradictory traits with which he is accredited. The whole atmosphere
of the story is unreal, fantastic, obscure. An attempt is made to endow our poor, raw New York
with something of the stormy and ominous mystery of the immemorial cities of Europe. The best
feature of the book (morbidness aside) is the construction of the plot, which shows ingenuity
and an artistic perception of the value of mystery and moral compensation. It recalls, in some
respects, the design of Hawthorne's "Blithedale Romance,"--that is, had the latter never been
written, the former would probably have been written differently. In spite of its faults, it
is an interesting book, and, to the critical eye, there are in almost every chapter signs that
indicate the possession of no ordinary gifts on the author's part. But it may be doubted whether
the special circumstances under which it was published had not something to do with its wide
popularity. I imagine "John Brent" to have been really much more popular, in the better sense;
it was read and liked by a higher class of readers. It is young ladies and school-girls who
swell the numbers of an "edition," and hence the difficulty in arguing from this as to the
literary merit of the book itself.

"Edwin Brothertoft," though somewhat disjointed in construction, and jerky in style, is yet
a picturesque and striking story; and the gallop of the hero across country and through the
night to rescue from the burning house the woman who had been false to him, is vigorously described,
and gives us some foretaste of the thrill of suspense and excitement we feel in reading the
story of the famous "Gallop of three" in "John Brent." The writer's acquaintance with the history
of the period is adequate, and a romantic and chivalrous tone is preserved throughout the volume.
It is worth noting that, in all three of Winthrop's novels, a horse bears a part in the crisis
of the tale. In "Cecil Dreeme" it is Churm's pair of trotters that convey the party of rescuers
to the private Insane Asylum in which Densdeth had confined the heroine. In "Edwin Brothertoft,"
it is one of Edwin's renowned breed of white horses that carries him through almost insuperable
obstacles to his goal. In "John Brent," the black stallion, Don Fulano, who is throughout the
chief figure in the book, reaches his apogee in the tremendous race across the plains and down
the rocky gorge of the mountains, to where the abductors of the heroine are just about to pitch
their camp at the end of their day's journey. The motive is fine and artistic, and, in each
of the books, these incidents are as good as, or better then, anything else in the narrative.

"John Brent" is, in fact, full enough of merit to more than redeem its defects. The self-consciousness
of the writer is less noticeable than in the other works, and the effort to be epigrammatic,
short, sharp, and "telling" in style, is considerably modified. The interest is lively, continuous,
and cumulative; and there is just enough tragedy in the story to make the happy ending all
the happier. It was a novel and adventurous idea to make a horse the hero of a tale, and the
manner in which the idea is carried out more than justifies the hazard. Winthrop, as we know,
was an ideal horseman, and knows what he is writing about. He contrives to realize Don Fulano
for us, in spite of the almost supernatural powers and intelligence that he ascribes to the
gallant animal. One is willing to stretch a point of probability when such a dashing and inspiring
end is in view. In the present day we are getting a little tired of being brought to account,
at every turn, by Old Prob., who tyrannizes over literature quite as much as over the weather.
Theodore Winthrop's inspiration, in this instance at least, was strong and genuine enough to
enable him to feel what he was telling as the truth, and therefore it produces an effect of
truth upon the reader. How distinctly every incident of that ride remains stamped on the memory,
even after so long an interval as has elapsed since it was written! And I recollect that one
of the youthful devourers of this book, who was of an artistic turn, was moved to paint three
little water- color pictures of the Gallop; the first showing the three horses,--the White,
the Gray, and the Black, scouring across the prairie, towards the barrier of mountains behind
which the sun was setting; the second depicting Don Fulano, with Dick Wade and John Brent on
his back, plunging down the gorge upon the abductors, one of whom had just pulled the trigger
of his rifle; while the third gives the scene in which the heroic horse receives his death-wound
in carrying the fugitive across the creek away from his pursuers. At this distance of time,
I am unable to bear any testimony as to the technical value of the little pictures; I am inclined
to fancy that they would have to be taken cum grano amoris, as they certainly were executed
con amore. But, however that may be, the instance (which was doubtless only one of many analogous
to it) shows that Winthrop possessed the faculty of stimulating and electrifying the imagination
of his readers, which all our recent improvements in the art and artifice of composition have
not made too common, and for which, if for nothing else, we might well feel indebted to him.

CHAPTER IX.

EMERSON AS AN AMERICAN.

It is not with Americans as with other peoples. Our position is more vague and difficult, because
it is not primarily related to the senses. I can easily find out where England or Prussia is,
and recognize an Englishman or German when we meet; but we Americans are not, to the same extent
as these, limited by geographical and physical boundaries. The origin of America was not like
that of the European nations; the latter were born after the flesh, but we after the spirit.
It is of the first consequence to them that their frontiers should be defended, and their nationality
kept distinct. But, though I esteem highly all our innumerable square miles of East and West,
North and South, and our Pacific and Atlantic coasts, I cannot help deeming them quite a secondary
consideration. If America is not a great deal more than these United States, then the United
States are no better than a penal colony. It is convenient, no doubt, for a great idea to find
a great embodiment--a suitable incarnation and stage; but the idea does not depend upon these
things. It is an accidental--or, I would rather say, a Providential--matter that the Puritans
came to New England, or that Columbus discovered the continent in time for them; but it has
always happened that when a soul is born it finds a body ready fitted to it. The body, however,
is an instrument merely; it enables the spirit to take hold of its mortal life, just as the
hilt enables us to grasp the sword. If the Puritans had not come to New England, still the
spirit that animated them would have lived, and made itself a place somehow. And, in fact,
how many Puritans, for how many ages previous, had been trying to find standing-room in the
world, and failed! They called themselves by many names; their voices were heard in many countries;
the time had not yet come for them to be born--to touch their earthly inheritance; but, meantime,
the latent impetus was accumulating, and the Mayflower was driven across the Atlantic by it
at last. Nor is this all-- the Mayflower is sailing still between the old world and the new.
Every day it brings new settlers, if not to our material harbors--to our Boston Bay, our Castle
Garden, our Golden Gate--at any rate, to our mental ports and wharves. We cannot take up a
European newspaper without finding an American idea in it. It is said that a great many of
our countrymen take the steamer to England every summer. But they come back again; and they
bring with them many who come to stay. I do not refer specially to the occupants of the steerage--the
literal emigrants. One cannot say much about them--they may be Americans or not, as it turns
out. But England and the continent are full of Americans who were born there, and many of whom
will die there. Sometimes they are better Americans than the New Yorker or the Bostonian who
lives in Beacon Street or the Bowery and votes in the elections. They may be born and reside
where they please, but they belong to us, and, in the better sense, they are among us. Broadway
and Washington Street, Vermont and Colorado extend all over Europe. Russia is covered with
them; she tries to shove them away to Siberia, but in vain. We call mountains and prairies
solid facts; but the geography of the mind is infinitely more stubborn. I dare say there are
a great many oblique- eyed, pig-tailed New Englanders in the Celestial Empire. They may never
have visited these shores, or even heard of them; but what of that? They think our thought--they
have apprehended our idea, and, by and by, they or their heirs will cause it to prevail.

It is useless for us to hide our heads in the grass and refuse to rise to the height of our
occasion. We are here as the realization of a truth--the fulfilment of a prophecy; we must
attest a new departure in the moral and intellectual development of the human race; for whichever
of us does not, must suffer annihilation. If I deny my birthright as an American, I shall disappear
and not be missed, for an American will take my place. It is not altogether a luxurious position
to find yourself in. You cannot sit still and hold your hands. All manner of hard and unpleasant
things are expected of you, which you neglect at your peril. It is like the old fable of the
mermaid. She loved a mortal youth, and, in order that she might win his affection, she prayed
that she might have the limbs and feet of a human maiden. Her prayer was answered, and she
met her prince; but every step she took was as if she trod on razors. It is a fine thing to
sit in your chair and reflect on being an American; but when you have to rise up and do an
American's duty before the world--how sharp the razors are!

Of course, we do not always endure the test; the flesh and blood on this side of the planet
is not, so far as I have observed, of a quality essentially different from that on the other.
Possibly our population is too many for us. Out of fifty million people it would be strange
if here and there one appeared who was not at all points a hero. Indeed, I am sometimes tempted
to think that that little band of original Mayflower Pilgrims has not greatly multiplied since
their disembarkation. However it may be with their bodily offspring, their spiritual progeny
are not invariably found in the chair of the Governor or on the floor of the Senate. What are
these Irish fellow-creatures doing here? Well, Bridget serves us in the kitchen; but Patrick
is more helpful yet; he goes to the legislature, and is the servant of the people at large.
It is very obliging of him; but turn and turn about is fair play; and it would be no more than
justice were we, once in a while, to take off our coat and serve Patrick in the same way.

When we get into a tight place we are apt to try to slip out of it under some plea of a European
precedent. But it used to be supposed that it was precisely European precedents that we came
over here to avoid. I am not profoundly versed in political economy, nor is this the time or
place to discuss its principles; but, as regards protection, for example, I can conceive that
there may be arguments against it as well as for it. Emerson used to say that the way to conquer
the foreign artisan was not to kill him but to beat his work. He also pointed out that the
money we made out of the European wars, at the beginning of this century, had the result of
bringing the impoverished population of those countries down upon us in the shape of emigrants.
They shared our crops and went on the poor-rates, and so we did not gain so much after all.
One cannot help wishing that America would assume the loftiest possible ground in her political
and commercial relations. With all due respect to the sagacity and ability of our ruling demagogues,
I should not wish them to be quoted as typical Americans. The domination of such persons has
an effect which is by no means measurable by their personal acts. What they can do is of infinitesimal
importance. But the mischief is that they incline every one of us to believe, as Emerson puts
it, in two gods. They make the morality of Wall Street and the White House seem to be a different
thing from that of our parlors and nurseries. "He may be a little shady on 'change," we say,
"but he is a capital fellow when you know him." But if he is a capital fellow when I know him,
then I shall never find much fault with his professional operations, and shall end, perhaps,
by allowing him to make some investments for me. Why should not I be a capital fellow too--
and a fellow of capital, to boot! I can endure public opprobrium with tolerable equanimity
so long as it remains public. It is the private cold looks that trouble me.

In short, we may speak of America in two senses--either meaning the America that actually meets
us at the street corners and in the newspapers, or the ideal America--America as it ought to
be. They are not the same thing; and, at present, there seems to be a good deal more of the
former than of the latter. And yet, there is a connection between them; the latter has made
the former possible. We sometimes see a great crowd drawn together by proclamation, for some
noble purpose--to decide upon a righteous war, or to pass a just decree. But the people on
the outskirts of the crowd, finding themselves unable to hear the orators, and their time hanging
idle on their hands, take to throwing stones, knocking off hats, or, perhaps, picking pockets.
They may have come to the meeting with as patriotic or virtuous intentions as the promoters
themselves; nay, under more favorable circumstances, they might themselves have become promoters.
Virtue and patriotism are not private property; at certain times any one may possess them.
And, on the other hand, we have seen examples enough, of late, of persons of the highest respectability
and trust turning out, all at once, to be very sorry scoundrels. A man changes according to
the person with whom he converses; and though the outlook is rather sordid to-day, we have
not forgotten that during the Civil War the air seemed full of heroism. So that these two Americas--the
real and the ideal--far apart though they may be in one sense, may, in another sense, be as
near together as our right hand to our left. In a greater or less degree, they exist side by
side in each one of us. But civil wars do not come every day; nor can we wish them to, even
to show us once more that we are worthy of our destiny. We must find some less expensive and
quieter method of reminding ourselves of that. And of such methods, none, perhaps, is better
than to review the lives of Americans who were truly great; to ask what their country meant
to them; what they wished her to become; what virtues and what vices they detected in her.
Passion may be generous, but passion cannot last; and when it is over, we are cold and indifferent
again. But reason and example reach us when we are calm and passive; and what they inculcate
is more likely to abide. At least, it will be only evil passion that can cast it out.

I have said that many a true American is doubtless born, and lives, abroad; but that does not
prevent Emerson from having been born here. So far as the outward accidents of generation and
descent go, he could not have been more American than he was. Of course, one prefers that it
should be so. A rare gem should be fitly set. A noble poem should be printed with the fairest
type of the Riverside Press, and upon fine paper with wide margins. It helps us to believe
in ourselves to be told that Emerson's ancestry was not only Puritan, but clerical; that the
central and vital thread of the idea that created us, ran through his heart. The nation, and
even New England, Massachusetts, Boston, have many traits that are not found in him; but there
is nothing in him that is not a refinement, a sublimation and concentration of what is good
in them; and the selection and grouping of the elements are such that he is a typical figure.
Indeed, he is all type; which is the same as saying that there is nobody like him. And, mentally,
he produces the impression of being all force; in his writings, his mind seems to have acted
immediately, without natural impediment or friction; as if a machine should be run that was
not hindered by the contact of its parts. As he was physically lean and narrow of figure, and
his face nothing but so many features welded together, so there was no adipose tissue in his
thought. It is pure, clear, and accurate, and has the fault of dryness; but often moves in
forms of exquisite beauty. It is not adhesive; it sticks to nothing, nor anything to it; after
ranging through all the various philosophies of the world, it comes out as clean and characteristic
as ever. It has numberless affinities, but no adhesion; it does not even adhere to itself.
There are many separate statements in any one of his essays which present no logical continuity;
but although this fact has caused great anxiety to many disciples of Emerson, it never troubled
him. It was the inevitable result of his method of thought. Wandering at will in the flower-garden
of religious and moral philosophy, it was his part to pluck such blossoms as he saw were beautiful;
not to find out their botanical interconnection. He would afterward arrange them, for art or
harmony's sake, according to their color or their fragrance; but it was not his affair to go
any farther in their classification.

This intuitive method of his, however little it may satisfy those who wish to have all their
thinking done for them, who desire not only to have given to them all the cities of the earth,
but also to have straight roads built for them from one to the other, carries with it its own
justification. "There is but one reason," is Emerson's saying; and again and again does he
prove without proving it. We confess, over and over, that the truth which he asserts is indeed
a truth. Even his own variations from the truth, when he is betrayed into them, serve to confirm
the rule. For these are seldom or never intuitions at first hand--pure intuitions; but, as
it were, intuitions from previous intuitions--deductions. The form of statement is the same,
but the source is different; they are from Emerson, instead of from the Absolute; tinted, not
colorless. They show a mental bias, very slight, but redeeming him back to humanity. We love
him the more for them, because they indicate that for him, too, there was a choice of ways,
and that he must struggle and watch to choose the right.

We are so much wedded to systems, and so accustomed to connect a system with a man, that the
absence of system, either explicit or implicit, in Emerson, strikes us as a defect. And yet
truth has no system, nor the human mind. This philosopher maintains one, that another thesis.
Both are true essentially, and yet there seems a contradiction between them. We cannot bear
to be illogical, and so we enlist some under this banner, some under that. By so doing we sacrifice
to consistency at least the half of truth. Thence we come to examine our intuitions, and ask
them, not whether they are true in themselves, but what are their tendencies. If it turn out
that they will lead us to stultify some past conclusion to which we stand committed, we drop
them like hot coals. To Emerson, this behavior appeared the nakedest personal vanity. Recognizing
that he was finite, he could not desire to be consistent. If he saw to-day that one thing was
true, and to- morrow that its opposite was true, was it for him to elect which of the two truths
should have his preference? No; to reject either would be to reject all; it belonged to God
alone to reconcile these contradictious. Between infinite and finite can be no ratio; and the
consistency of the Creator implies the inconsistency of the creature.

Emerson's Americanism, therefore, was Americanism in its last and purest analysis, which is
giving him high praise, and to America great hope. But I do not mean to pay him, who was so
full of modesty and humility, the ungrateful compliment of holding him up as the permanent
American ideal. It is his tendencies, his quality, that are valuable, and only in a minor,
incipient degree his actual results. All human results must be strictly limited, and according
to the epoch and outlook. Emerson does not solve for all time the problem of the universe;
he solves nothing; but he does what is far more useful--he gives a direction and an impetus
to lofty human endeavor. He does not anticipate the lessons and the discipline of the ages,
but he shows us how to deal with circumstances in such a manner as to secure the good instead
of the evil influence. New conditions, fresh discoveries, unexpected horizons opening before
us, will, no doubt, soon carry us beyond the scope of Emerson's surmise; but we shall not so
easily improve upon his aim and attitude. In the spaces beyond the stars there may be marvels
such as it has not entered into the mind of man to conceive; but there, as here, the right
way to look will still be upward, and the right aspiration be still toward humbleness and charity.
I have just spoken of Emerson's absence of system; but his writings have nevertheless a singular
coherence, by virtue of the single-hearted motive that has inspired them. Many will, doubtless,
have noticed, as I have done, how the whole of Emerson illustrates every aspect of him.

Whether your discourse be of his religion, of his ethics, of his relation to society, or what
not, the picture that you draw will have gained color and form from every page that he has
written. He does not lie in strata; all that he is permeates all that he has done. His books
cannot be indexed, unless you would refer every subject to each paragraph. And so he cannot
treat, no matter what subject, without incorporating in his statement the germs at least of
all that he has thought and believed. In this respect he is like light--the presence of the
general at the particular. And, to confess the truth, I find myself somewhat loath to diffract
this pure ray to the arbitrary end of my special topic. Why should I speak of him as an American?
That is not his definition. He was an American because he was himself. America, however, gives
less limitation than any other nationality to a generous and serene personality.

I am sometimes disposed to think that Emerson's "English Traits" reveal his American traits
more than anything else he has written. We are described by our own criticisms of others, and
especially by our criticisms of another nation; the exceptions we take are the mould of our
own figures. So we have valuable glimpses of Emerson's contours throughout this volume. And
it is in all respects a fortunate work; as remarkable a one almost for him to write as a volume
of his essays for any one else. Comparatively to his other books, it is as flesh and blood
to spirit; Emersonian flesh and blood, it is true, and semi-translucent; but still it completes
the man for us: he would have remained too problematical without it. Those who have never personally
known him may finish and solidify their impressions of him here. He likes England and the English,
too; and that sympathy is beyond our expectation of the mind that evolved "Nature" and "The
Over-Soul." The grasp of his hand, I remember, was firm and stout, and we perceive those qualities
in the descriptions and cordiality of "English Traits." Then, it is an objective book; the
eye looks outward, not inward; these pages afford a basis not elsewhere obtainable of comparing
his general human faculty with that of other men. Here he descends from the airy heights he
treads so easily and, standing foot to foot with his peers, measures himself against them.
He intends only to report their stature, and to leave himself out of the story; but their answers
to his questions show what the questions were, and what the questioner. And we cannot help
suspecting, though he did not, that the Englishmen were not a little put to it to keep pace
with their clear- faced, penetrating, attentive visitor.

He has never said of his own countrymen the comfortable things that he tells of the English;
but we need not grumble at that. The father who is severe with his own children will freely
admire those of others, for whom he is not responsible. Emerson is stern toward what we are,
and arduous indeed in his estimate of what we ought to be. He intimates that we are not quite
worthy of our continent; that we have not as yet lived up to our blue china. "In America the
geography is sublime, but the men are not." And he adds that even our more presentable public
acts are due to a money- making spirit: "The benefaction derived in Illinois and the great
West from railroads is inestimable, and vastly exceeding any intentional philanthropy on record."
He does not think very respectfully of the designs or the doings of the people who went to
California in 1849, though he admits that "California gets civilized in this immoral way,"
and is fain to suppose that, "as there is use in the world for poisons, so the world cannot
move without rogues," and that, in respect of America, "the huge animals nourish huge parasites,
and the rancor of the disease attests the strength of the constitution." He ridicules our unsuspecting
provincialism: "Have you seen the dozen great men of New York and Boston? Then you may as well
die!" He does not spare our tendency to spread- eagleism and declamation, and having quoted
a shrewd foreigner as saying of Americans that, "Whatever they say has a little the air of
a speech," he proceeds to speculate whether "the American forest has refreshed some weeds of
old Pictish barbarism just ready to die out?" He finds the foible especially of American youth
to be--pretension; and remarks, suggestively, that we talk much about the key of the age, but
"the key to all ages is imbecility!" He cannot reconcile himself to the mania for going abroad.
"There is a restlessness in our people that argues want of character.... Can we never extract
this tapeworm of Europe from the brain of our countrymen?" He finds, however, this involuntary
compensation in the practice--that, practically "we go to Europe to be Americanized," and has
faith that "one day we shall cast out the passion for Europe by the passion for America." As
to our political doings, he can never regard them with complacency. "Politics is an afterword,"
he declares--"a poor patching. We shall one day learn to supersede politics by education."
He sympathizes with Lovelace's theory as to iron bars and stone walls, and holds that freedom
and slavery are inward, not outward conditions. Slavery is not in circumstance, but in feeling;
you cannot eradicate the irons by external restrictions; and the truest way to emancipate the
slave would be to educate him to a comprehension of his inviolable dignity and freedom as a
human being. Amelioration of outward circumstances will be the effect, but can never be the
means of mental and moral improvement. "Nothing is more disgusting," he affirms, generalizing
the theme, "than the crowing about liberty by slaves, as most men are, and the flippant mistaking
for freedom of some paper preamble like a 'Declaration of Independence' or the statute right
to vote." But, "Our America has a bad name for superficialness. Great men, great nations, have
not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers of the terrors of life, and have nerved themselves
to face it." He will not be deceived by the clamor of blatant reformers.

He does not shrink from questioning the validity of some of our pet institutions, as, for instance,
universal suffrage. He reminds us that in old Egypt the vote of a prophet was reckoned equal
to one hundred hands, and records his opinion that it was much underestimated. "Shall we, then,"
he asks, "judge a country by the majority or by the minority? By the minority, surely! 'Tis
pedantry to estimate nations by the census, or by square miles of land, or other than by their
importance to the mind of the time." The majority are unripe, and do not yet know their own
opinion. He would not, however, counsel an organic alteration in this respect, believing that,
with the progress of enlightenment, such coarse constructions of human rights will adjust themselves.
He concedes the sagacity of the Fultons and Watts of politics, who, noticing that the opinion
of the million was the terror of the world, grouped it on a level, instead of piling it into
a mountain, and so contrived to make of this terror the most harmless and energetic form of
a State. But, again, he would not have us regard the State as a finality, or as relieving any
man of his individual responsibility for his actions and purposes. We are to confide in God--and
not in our money, and in the State because it is guard of it. The Union itself has no basis
but the good pleasure of the majority to be united. The wise and just men impart strength to
the State, not receive it; and, if all went down, they and their like would soon combine in
a new and better constitution. Yet he will not have us forget that only by the supernatural
is a man strong; nothing so weak as an egotist. We are mighty only as vehicles of a truth before
which State and individual are alike ephemeral. In this sense we, like other nations, shall
have our kings and nobles--the leading and inspiration of the best; and he who would become
a member of that nobility must obey his heart.

Government, he observes, has been a fossil--it should be a plant; statute law should express,
not impede, the mind of mankind. In tracing the course of human political institutions, he
finds feudalism succeeding monarchy, and this again followed by trade, the good and evil of
which is that it would put everything in the market, talent, beauty, virtue, and man himself.
By this means it has done its work; it has faults and will end as the others. Its aristocracy
need not be feared, for it can have no permanence, it is not entailed. In the time to come,
he hopes to see us less anxious to be governed, in the technical sense; each man shall govern
himself in the interests of all; government without any governor will be, for the first time,
adamantine. Is not every man sometimes a radical in politics? Men are conservatives when they
are least vigorous, or when they are most luxurious; conservatism stands on man's limitations,
reform on his infinitude. The age of the quadruped is to go out; the age of the brain and the
heart is to come in. We are too pettifogging and imitative in our legislative conceptions;
the Legislature of this country should become more catholic and cosmopolitan than any other.
Let us be brave and strong enough to trust in humanity; strong natures are inevitable patriots.
The time, the age, what is that, but a few prominent persons and a few active persons who epitomize
the times? There is a bribe possible for any finite will; but the pure sympathy with universal
ends is an infinite force, and cannot be bribed or bent. The world wants saviors and religions;
society is servile from want of will; but there is a Destiny by which the human race is guided,
the race never dying, the individual never spared; its law is, you shall have everything as
a member, nothing to yourself. Referring to the communities of various kinds, which were so
much in vogue some years ago, he holds such to be valuable, not for what they have done, but
for the indication they give of the revolution that is on the way. He must not shun whatever
comes to him in the way of duty; the only path of escape is--performance. We shall come out
well, whatever personal or political disasters may intervene. For here in America is the home
of man. After deducting our pitiful politics--shall John or Jonathan sit in the chair and hold
the purse?--and making due allowance for our frivolities and insanities, there still remains
an organic simplicity and liberty, which, when it loses its balance, redresses itself presently,
and which offers to the human mind opportunities not known elsewhere.

Whenever he touches upon the fundamental elements of social and rational life, it is always
to enlarge and illuminate our conception of them. We are not wont to question the propriety
of the sentiment of patriotism, for instance. We are to swear by our own lares and penates,
and stand up for the American eagle, right or wrong. But Emerson instantly goes beneath this
interpretation and exposes its crudity. The true sense of patriotism, according to him, is
almost the reverse of its popular sense. He has no sympathy with that boyish egotism, hoarse
with cheering for our side, for our State, for our town; the right patriotism consists in the
delight which springs from contributing our peculiar and legitimate advantages to the benefit
of humanity. Every foot of soil has its proper quality; the grape on two sides of the fence
has new flavors; and so every acre on the globe, every family of men, every point of climate,
has its distinguishing virtues. This being admitted, however, Emerson will yield in patriotism
to no one; his only concern is that the advantages we contribute shall be the most instead
of the least possible. "This country," he says, "does not lie here in the sun causeless, and
though it may not be easy to define its influence, men feel already its emancipating quality
in the careless self- reliance of the manners, in the freedom of thought, in the direct roads
by which grievances are reached and redressed, and even in the reckless and sinister politics,
not less than in purer expressions. Bad as it is, this freedom leads onward and upward to a
Columbia of thought and art, which is the last and endless end of Columbus's adventure." Nor
is this poet of virtue and philosophy ever more truly patriotic, from his spiritual standpoint,
than when he throws scorn and indignation upon his country's sins and frailties. "But who is
he that prates of the culture of mankind, of better arts and life? Go, blind worm, go--behold
the famous States harrying Mexico with rifle and with knife! Or who, with accent bolder, dare
praise the freedom-loving mountaineer? Wherefore? To what good end? Boston Bay and Bunker Hill
would serve things still--things are of the snake. The horseman serves the horse, the neat-herd
serves the neat, the merchant serves the purse, the eater serves his meat; 'tis the day of
the chattel, web to weave, and corn to grind; things are in the saddle, and ride mankind!"

But I must not begin to quote Emerson's poetry; only it is worth noting that he, whose verse
is uniformly so abstractly and intellectually beautiful, kindles to passion whenever his theme
is of America. The loftiest patriotism never found more ardent and eloquent expression than
in the hymn sung at the completion of the Concord monument, on the 19th of April, 1836. There
is no rancor in it; no taunt of triumph; "the foe long since in silence slept"; but throughout
there resounds a note of pure and deep rejoicing at the victory of justice over oppression,
which Concord fight so aptly symbolized. In "Hamatreya" and "The Earth Song," another chord
is struck, of calm, laconic irony. Shall we too, he asks, we Yankee farmers, descendants of
the men who gave up all for freedom, go back to the creed outworn of medieval feudalism and
aristocracy, and say, of the land that yields us its produce, "'Tis mine, my children's, and
my name's"? Earth laughs in flowers at our boyish boastfulness, and asks "How am I theirs if
they cannot hold me, but I hold them?" "When I heard 'The Earth Song,' I was no longer brave;
my avarice cooled, like lust in the child of the grave" Or read "Monadnoc," and mark the insight
and the power with which the significance and worth of the great facts of nature are interpreted
and stated. "Complement of human kind, having us at vantage still, our sumptuous indigence,
oh, barren mound, thy plenties fill! We fool and prate; thou art silent and sedate. To myriad
kinds and times one sense the constant mountain doth dispense; shedding on all its snows and
leaves, one joy it joys, one grief it grieves. Thou seest, oh, watchman tall, our towns and
races grow and fall, and imagest the stable good for which we all our lifetime grope; and though
the substance us elude, we in thee the shadow find." ... "Thou dost supply the shortness of
our days, and promise, on thy Founder's truth, long morrow to this mortal youth!" I have ignored
the versified form in these extracts, in order to bring them into more direct contrast with
the writer's prose, and show that the poetry is inherent. No other poet, with whom I am acquainted,
has caused the very spirit of a land, the mother of men, to express itself so adequately as
Emerson has done in these pieces. Whitman falls short of them, it seems to me, though his effort
is greater.

Emerson is continually urging us to give heed to this grand voice of hills and streams, and
to mould ourselves upon its suggestions. The difficulty and the anomaly are that we are not
native; that England is our mother, quite as much as Monadnoc; that we are heirs of memories
and traditions reaching far beyond the times and the confines of the Republic. We cannot assume
the splendid childlikeness of the great primitive races, and exhibit the hairy strength and
unconscious genius that the poet longs to find in us. He remarks somewhere that the culminating
period of good in nature and the world is in just that moment of transition, when the swarthy
juices still flow plentifully from nature, but their astringency or acidity is got out by ethics
and humanity.

It was at such a period that Greece attained her apogee; but our experience, it seems to me,
must needs be different. Our story is not of birth, but of regeneration, a far more subtle
and less obvious transaction. The Homeric California of which Bret Harte is the reporter does
not seem to me in the closest sense American. It is a comparatively superficial matter--this
savage freedom and raw poetry; it belongs to all pioneering life, where every man must stand
for himself, and Judge Lynch strings up the defaulter to the nearest tree. But we are only
incidentally pioneers in this sense; and the characteristics thus impressed upon us will leave
no traces in the completed American. That is stirringly said: but, as a matter of fact, most
of the Americans whom we recognize as great did not have such a history; nor, if they had it,
would they be on that account more American. On the other hand, the careers of men like Jim
Fiske and Commodore Vanderbilt might serve very well as illustrations of the above sketch.
If we must wait for our character until our geographical advantages and the absence of social
distinctions manufacture it for us, we are likely to remain a long while in suspense. When
our foreign visitors begin to evince a more poignant interest in Concord and Fifth Avenue than
in the Mississippi and the Yellowstone, it may be an indication to us that we are assuming
our proper position relative to our physical environment. "The land," says Emerson, "is a sanative
and Americanizing influence which promises to disclose new virtues for ages to come." Well,
when we are virtuous, we may, perhaps, spare our own blushes by allowing our topography, symbolically,
to celebrate us, and when our admirers would worship the purity of our intentions, refer them
to Walden Pond; or to Mount Shasta, when they would expatiate upon our lofty generosity. It
is, perhaps, true, meanwhile, that the chances of a man's leading a decent life are greater
in a palace than in a pigsty.

But this is holding our author too strictly to the letter of his message. And, at any rate,
the Americanism of Emerson is better than anything that he has said in vindication of it. He
is the champion of this commonwealth; he is our future, living in our present, and showing
the world, by anticipation, as it were, what sort of excellence we are capable of attaining.
A nation that has produced Emerson, and can recognize in him bone of her bone and flesh of
her flesh--and, still more, spirit of her spirit--that nation may look toward the coming age
with security. But he has done more than thus to prophesy of his country; he is electric and
stimulates us to fulfil our destiny. Emerson, helps us most in provoking us to help ourselves.
The pleasantest revenge is that which we can sometimes take upon our great men in quoting of
themselves what they have said of others.

It is easy to be so revenged upon Emerson, because he, more than most persons of such eminence,
has been generous and cordial in his appreciation of all human worth. Who can state the mission
and effect of Emerson more tersely and aptly than those words do it?

But, once more, he does not desire eulogiums, and it seems half ungenerous to force them upon
him now that he can no longer defend himself. I prefer to conclude by repeating a passage characteristic
of him both as a man and as an American, and which, perhaps, conveys a sounder and healthier
criticism, both for us and for him, than any mere abject and nerveless admiration; for great
men are great only in so far as they liberate us, and we undo their work in courting their tyranny.

CHAPTER X.

MODERN MAGIC.

Human nature enjoys nothing better than to wonder--to be mystified; and it thanks and remembers
those who have the skill to gratify this craving. The magicians of old knew that truth and
conducted themselves accordingly. But our modern wonder-workers fail of their due influence,
because, not content to perform their marvels, they go on to explain them. Merlin and Roger
Bacon were greater public benefactors than Morse and Edison. Man is --and he always has been
and will be--something else besides a pure intelligence: and science, in order to become really
popular, must contrive to touch man somewhere else besides on the purely intellectual side:
it must remember that man is all heart, all hope, all fear, and all foolishness, quite as much
as he is all brains. Otherwise, science can never expect to take the place of superstition,
much less of religion, in mankind's affection. In order to be a really successful man of science,
it is first of all indispensable to make one's self master of everything in nature and in human
nature that science is not.

What must one do, in short, in order to become a magician? I use the term, here, in its weightiest
sense. How to make myself visible and invisible at will? How to present myself in two or more
places at once? How answer your question before you ask it, and describe to you your most secret
thoughts and actions? How shall I call spirits from the vasty deep, and make you see and hear
and feel them? How paralyze your strength with a look, heal your wound with a touch, or cause
your bullet to rebound harmless from my unprotected flesh? How shall I walk on the air, sink
through the earth, pass through stone walls, or walk, dry-shod, on the floor of the ocean?
How shall I visit the other side of the moon, jump through the ring of Saturn, and gather sunflowers
in Sirius? There are persons now living who profess to do no less remarkable feats, and to
regard them as incidental merely to achievements far more important. A school of hierophants
or adepts is said to exist in Tibet, who, as a matter of daily routine, quite transcend everything
that we have been accustomed to consider natural possibility. What is the course of study,
what are the ways and means whereby such persons accomplish such results?

The conventional attitude towards such matters is, of course, that of unconditional scepticism.
But it is pleasant, occasionally, to take an airing beyond the bounds of incredulity. For my
own part, it is true, I must confess my inability to believe in anything positively supernatural.
The supernatural and the illusory are to my mind convertible terms: they cannot really exist
or take place. Let us be sure, however, that we are agreed as to what supernatural means. If
a magician, before my eyes, transformed an old man into a little girl, I should call that supernatural;
and nothing should convince me that my senses had not been grossly deceived. But were the magician
to leave the room by passing through the solid wall, or "go out" like an exploding soap-bubble,--I
might think what I please, but I should not venture to dogmatically pronounce the thing supernatural;
because the phenomenon known as "matter" is scientifically unknown, and therefore no one can
tell what modifications it may not be susceptible of:--no one, that is to say, except the person
who, like the magician of our illustration, professes to possess, and (for aught I can affirm
to the contrary) may actually possess a knowledge unshared by the bulk of mankind. The transformation
of an old man into a little girl, on the other hand, would be a transaction involving the immaterial
soul as well as the material body; and if I do not know that that cannot take place, I am forever
incapable of knowing anything. These are extreme examples, but they serve to emphasize an important
distinction.

The whole domain of magic, in short, occupies that anomalous neutral ground that intervenes
between the facts of our senses and the truths of our intuitions. Fact and truth are not convertible
terms; they abide in two distinct planes, like thought and speech, or soul and body; one may
imply or involve the other, but can never demonstrate it. Experience and intuition together
comprehend the entire realm of actual and conceivable knowledge. Whatever contradicts both
experience and intuition may, therefore, be pronounced illusion. But this neutral ground is
the home of phenomena which intuition does not deny, and which experience has not confirmed.
It is still a wide zone, though not so wide as it was a hundred years ago, or fifty, or even
ten. It narrows every day, as science, or the classification of experience, expands. Are we,
then, to look for a time when the zone shall have dwindled to a mathematical line, and magic
confess itself to have been nothing but the science of an advanced school of investigators?
Will the human intellect acquire a power before which all mysteries shall become transparent?
Let us dwell upon this question a little longer.

A mystery that is a mystery can never, humanly speaking, become anything else. Instances of
such mysteries can readily be adduced. The universe itself is built upon them and is the greatest
of them. They lie before the threshold and at the basis of all existence. For example:--here
is a lump of compact, whitish, cheese-like substance, about as much as would go into a thimble.
From this I profess to be able to produce a gigantic, intricate structure, sixty feet in height
and diameter, hard, solid, and enduring, which shall furthermore possess the power of extending
and multiplying itself until it covers the whole earth, and even all the earths in the universe,
if it could reach them. Is such a profession as this credible? It is entirely credible, as
soon as I paraphrase it by saying that I propose to plant an acorn. And yet all magic has no
mystery which is so wonderful as this universal mystery of growth: and the only reason we are
not lost in amazement at it is that it goes quietly on all the time, and perfects itself under
uniform conditions. But let me eliminate from the phenomenon the one element of time--which
is logically the least essential factor in the product, unreal and arbitrary, based on the
revolution of the earth, and conceivably variable to any extent--grant me this, and the world
would come to see me do the miracle. But, with time or without it, the mystery is just as mysterious.

Natural mysteries, then,--the mysteries of life, death, creation, growth, --do not fall under
our present consideration: they are beyond the legitimate domain of magic: and no intellectual
development to which we may hereafter attain will bring us a step nearer their solution. But
with the problems proper to magic, the case is different. Magic is distinctively not Divine,
but human: a finite conundrum, not an Infinite enigma. If there has ever been a magician since
the world began, then all mankind may become magicians, if they will give the necessary time
and trouble. And yet, magic is not simply an advanced region of the path which science is pursuing.
Science is concerned with results,--with material phenomena; whereas magic is, primarily, the
study of causes, or of spiritual phenomena; or, to use another definition,--of phenomena which
the senses perceive, not in themselves, but only in their results. So long as we restrict ourselves
to results, our activity is confined to analysis; but when we begin to investigate causes,
we are on the road not only to comprehend results, but (within limits) to modify or produce them.

Science, however, blocks our advance in this direction by denying, or at least refusing to
admit, the existence of the spiritual world, or world of causes: because, being spiritual,
it is not sensible, or cognizable in sense. Science admits only material causes, or the changes
wrought in matter by itself. If we ask what is the cause of a material cause, we are answered
that it is a supposed entity called Force, concerning which there is nothing further to be known.

At this point, then, argument (on the material plane) comes to an end, and speculation or assumption
begins. Science answers its own questions, but neither can nor will answer any others. And
upon what pretence do we ask any others? We ask them upon two grounds. The first is that some
people,-- we might even say, most people,--would be glad to believe in supersensuous existence,
and are always on the alert to examine any plausible hypothesis pointing in that direction:
and secondly, there exists a vast amount of testimony (we need not call it evidence) tending
to show that the supersensuous world has been discovered, and that it endows its discoverers
with sundry notable advantages. Of course, we are not obliged to credit this testimony, unless
we want to: and--for some reason, never fully explained--a great many people who accept natural
mysteries quite amiably become indignant when requested to examine mysteries of a much milder
order. But it is not my intention to discuss the limits of the probable; but to swallow as
much as possible first, and endeavor to account for it afterwards.

There is, as every reader knows, a class of phenomena--such as hypnotism, trance, animal magnetism,
and so forth--the occurrence of which science has conceded, though failing as yet to offer
any intelligent explanation of them. It is suggested that they are peculiar states of the brain
and nerve-centres, physical in their nature and origin, though evading our present physical
tests. Be that as it may, they afford a capital introduction to the study of magic; if, indeed,
they, and a few allied phenomena, do not comprise the germs of the whole matter. Apropos of
this subject, a society has lately been organized in London, with branches on the Continent
and in this country, composed of scientific men, Fellows of the Royal Society, members of Parliament,
professors, and literary men, calling themselves the "Psychical Research Society," and making
it their business to test and investigate these very marvels, under the most stringent scientific
conditions. But the capacity to be deceived of the bodily senses is almost unlimited; in fact,
we know that they are incapable of telling us the ultimate truth on any subject; and we are
able to get along with them only because we have found their misinformation to be sufficiently
uniform for most practical purposes. But once admit that the origin of these phenomena is not
on the physical plane, and then, if we are to give any weight at all to them, it can be only
from a spiritual standpoint. In other words, unless we can approach such questions by an a
priori route, we might as well let them alone. We can reason from spirit to body--from mind
to matter--but we can never reverse that process, and from matter evolve mind. The reason is
that matter is not found to contain mind, but is only acted upon by it, as inferior by superior;
and we cannot get out of the bag more than has been put into it. The acorn (to use our former
figure) can never explain the oak; but the oak readily accounts for the acorn. It may be doubted,
therefore, whether the Psychical Research Society can succeed in doing more than to give a
respectable endorsement to a perplexing possibility,--so long as they adhere to the inductive
method. Should they, however, abandon the inductive method for the deductive, they will forfeit
the allegiance of all consistently scientific minds; and they may, perhaps, make some curious
contributions to philosophy. At present, they appear to be astride the fence between philosophy
and science, as if they hoped in some way to make the former satisfy the latter's demands.
But the difference between the evidence that demonstrates a fact and the evidence that confirms
a truth is, once more, a difference less of degree than of kind. We can never obtain sensible
verification of a proposition that transcends sense. We must accept it without material proof,
or not at all. We may believe, for instance, that Creation is the work of an intelligent Divine
Being; or we may disbelieve it; but we can never prove it. If we do believe it, innumerable
confirmations of it meet us at every turn: but no such confirmations, and no multiplication
of them, can persuade a disbeliever. For belief is ever incommunicable from without; it can
be generated only from within. The term "belief" cannot be applied to our recognition of a
physical fact: we do not believe in that--we are only sensible of it.

In this connection, a few words will be in order concerning what is called Spiritism,--a subject
which has of late years been exciting a good deal of remark. Its disciples claim for it the
dignity of a new and positive revelation,--a revelation to sense of spiritual being. Now, the
entire universe may be described as a revelation to sense of spiritual being--for those who
happen to believe a priori, or from spontaneous inward conviction, in spiritual being. We may
believe a man's body, for example, to be the effect of which his soul is the cause; but no
one can reach that conviction by the most refined dissection of the bodily tissues. How, then,
does the spiritists' Positive Revelation help the matter? Their answer is that the physical
universe is a permanent and orderly phenomenon which (setting aside the problem of its First
Cause) fully accounts for itself; whereas the phenomena of Spiritism, such as rapping, table-
tipping, materializing, and so forth, are, if not supernatural, at any rate extra-natural.
They occur in consequence of a conscious effort to bring them about; they cease when that effort
is discontinued; they abound in indications of being produced by independent intelligencies;
they are inexplicable upon any recognized theory of physics; and, therefore, there is nothing
for it but to regard them as spiritual. And what then? Then, of course, there must be spirits,
and a life after the death of the body; and the great question of Immortality is answered in
the affirmative!

Let us, for the sake of argument, concede that the manifestations upon which the Spiritists
found their claims are genuine: that they are or can be produced without fraud; and let us
then enquire in what respect our means for the conversion of the sceptic are improved. In the
first place we find that all the manifestations--be their cause what it may--can occur only
on the physical plane. However much the origin of the phenomena may perplex us, the phenomena
themselves must be purely material, in so far as they are perceptible at all. "Raps" are audible
according to the same laws of vibration as other sounds: the tilting table is simply a material
body displaced by an adequate agency; the materialized hand or face is nothing but physical
substance assuming form. Plainly, therefore, we have as much right to ascribe a spiritual source
to such phenomena as we have to ascribe a spiritual source to the ordinary phenomena of nature,
such as a tree or a man's body,--just as much right--and no more! Consequently, we are no nearer
converting our sceptic than we were at the outset. He admits the physical manifestation: there
is no intrinsic novelty about that: but when we proceed to argue that the manifestations are
wrought by spirits, he points out to us that this is sheer assumption on our part. "I have
not seen a spirit," he says: "I have not heard one; I have not felt one; nor is it possible
that my bodily senses should perceive anything that is not at least as physical as they are.
I have witnessed certain transactions effected by means unknown to me--possibly by the action
of a natural law not yet fully expounded by science. If there was anything spiritual in the
affair, it has not been manifest to my apprehension: and I must decline to lend my countenance
to any such pretensions."

That would be the reply of the sceptic who was equal to the emergency. But let us suppose that
he is not equal to it: that he is a weak-kneed, impressionable person, with a tendency to jump
at conclusions; and that he is scared or mystified into believing that "spirits" may be at
the bottom of it. What, then, will be the character of the faith which the Positive Revelation
has furnished him? He has discovered that existence continues, in some fashion, after the death
of the body. He has learned that there may be such a thing as--not immortality exactly, but--postmortem
consciousness. He has been saddled with the conviction that the other world is full of restless
ghosts, who come shuddering back from their cold emptiness, and try to warm themselves in the
borrowed flesh and blood, and with the purblind selfishness and curiosity of us who still remain
here. "Have faith: be not impatient: the conditions are unfavorable: but we are working for
you!"--such is the constant burden of the communications. But, if there be a God, why must
our relations with him be complicated by the interference of such forlorn prevaricators and
amateur Paracletes as these? we do not wish to be "worked for,"--to be carried heavenward on
some one else's shoulders: but to climb thither by God's help and our own will, or to stay
where we are. Moreover, by what touchstone shall we test the veracity of the self-appointed
purveyors of this Positive Revelation? Are we to believe what they say, because they have lost
their bodies? If life teaches us anything, it is that God does above all things respect the
spiritual freedom of his creatures. He does not terrify and bully us into acknowledging Him
by ghostly juggleries in darkened rooms, and by vapid exhibitions addressed to our outward
senses. He approaches each man in the innermost sacred audience-chamber of his heart, and there
shows him good and evil, truth and falsehood, and bids him choose. And that choice, if made
aright, becomes a genuine and undying belief, because it was made in freedom, unbiassed by
external threats and cajoleries.

Such belief is, itself, immortality,--something as distinct from post- mortem consciousness
as wisdom is distinct from mere animal intelligence. On the whole, therefore, there seems to
be little real worth in Spiritism, even accepting it at its own valuation. The nourishment
it yields the soul is too meagre; and--save on that one bare point of life beyond the grave,
which might just as easily prove an infinite curse as an infinite blessing--it affords no trustworthy
news whatever.

But these objections do not apply to magic proper. Magic seems to consist mainly in the control
which mind may exceptionally exercise over matter. In hypnotism, the subject abjectly believes
and obeys the operator. If he be told that he cannot step across a chalk mark on the floor,
he cannot step across it. He dissolves in tears or explodes with laughter, according as the
operator tells him he has cause for merriment or tears: and if he be assured that the water
he drinks is Madeira wine or Java coffee, he has no misgiving that such is not the case.

To say that this state of things is brought about by the exercise of the operator's will, is
not to explain the phenomenon, but to put it in different terms. What is the will, and how
does it produce such a result? Here is a man who believes, at the word of command, that the
thing which all the rest of the world calls a chair is a horse. How is such misapprehension
on his part possible? our senses are our sole means of knowing external objects: and this man's
senses seem to confirm--at least they by no means correct--his persuasion that a given object
is something very different. Could we solve this puzzle, we should have done something towards
gaining an insight into the philosophy of magic.

We observe, in the first place, that the rationale of hypnotism, and of trance in general,
is distinct from that of memory and of imagination, and even from that of dreams. It resembles
these only in so far as it involves a quasi-perception of something not actually present or
existent. But memory and imagination never mislead us into mistaking their suggestions for
realities: while in dreams, the dreamer's fancy alone is active; the bodily faculties are not
in action. In trance, however, the subject may appear to be, to all intents and purposes, awake.
Yet this state, unlike the others, is abnormal. The brain seems to be in a passive, or, at
any rate, in a detached condition; it cannot carry out or originate ideas, nor can it examine
an idea as to its truth or falsehood. Furthermore, it cannot receive or interpret the reports
of its own bodily senses. In short, its relations with the external world are suspended: and
since the body is a part of the external world, the brain can no longer control the body's
movements.

Bodily movements are, however, to some extent, automatic. Given a certain stimulus in the brain
or nerve-centres, and certain corresponding muscular contractions follow: and this whether
or not the stimulus be applied in a normal manner. Although, therefore, the entranced brain
cannot spontaneously control the body, yet if we can apply an independent stimulus to it, the
body will make a fitting and apparently intelligent response. The reader has doubtless seen
those ingenious pieces of mechanism which are set in motion by dropping into an orifice a coin
or pellet. Now, could we drop into the passive brain of an entranced person the idea that a
chair is a horse, for instance,--the person would give every sensible indication of having
adopted that figment as a fact.

But how (since he can no longer communicate with the world by means of his senses) is this
idea to be insinuated? The man is magnetized--that is to say, insulated; how can we have intercourse
with him?

Experiments show that this can be effected only through the magnetizer. Asleep towards the
rest of the world, towards him the entranced person is awake. Not awake, however, as to the
bodily senses; neither the magnetizer nor any one else can approach by that route. It is true
that, if the magnetizer speaks to him, he knows what is said: but he does not hear physically;
because he perceives the unspoken thought just as readily. But since whatever does not belong
to his body must belong to his soul (or mind, if that term be preferable), it follows that
the magnetizer must communicate with the magnetized on the mental or spiritual plane; that
is, immediately, or without the intervention of the body.

Let us review the position we have reached:--We have an entranced or magnetized person,--a
person whose mind, or spirit, has, by a certain process, been so far withdrawn from conscious
communion with his own bodily senses as to disable him from receiving through them any tidings
from the external world. He is not, however, wholly withdrawn from his body, for, in that case,
the body would be dead; whereas, in fact, its organic or animal life continues almost unimpaired.
He is therefore neither out of the body nor in it, but in an anomalous region midway between
the two,--a state in which he can receive no sensuous impressions from the physical world,
nor be put in conscious communication with the spiritual world through any channel--save one.

This one exception is, as we have seen, the person who magnetized him. The magnetizer is, then,
the one and only medium through which the person magnetized can obtain impressions: and these
impressions are conveyed directly from the mind, or spirit, of the magnetizer to that of the
magnetized. Let us note, further, that the former is not, like the latter, in a semi-disembodied
state, but is in the normal exercise of his bodily functions and faculties. He possesses, consequently,
his normal ability to originate ideas and to impart them: and whatever ideas he chooses to
impart to the magnetized person, the latter is fain passively and implicitly to accept. And
having so received them, they descend naturally into the automatic mechanism of the body, and
are by it mechanically interpreted or enacted.

So far, the theory is good: but something seems amiss in the working. We find that a certain
process frequently issues in a certain effect: but we do not yet know why this should be the
case. Some fundamental link is wanting; and this link is manifestly a knowledge of the true
relations between mind and matter: of the laws to which the mental or spiritual world is subject:
of what nature itself is: and of what Creation means. Let us cast a glance at these fundamental
subjects; for they are the key without which the secrets of magic must remain locked and hidden.

In common speech we call the realm of the material universe, Creation; but philosophy denies
its claim to that title. Man alone is Creation: everything else is appearance. The universe
appears, because man exists: he implies the universe, but is not implied by it. We may assist
our metaphysics, here, by a physical illustration. Take a glass prism and hold in the sunlight
before a white surface. Let the prism represent man: the sun, man's Creator: and the seven-hued
ray cast by the prism, nature, or the material universe. Now, if we remove the light, the ray
vanishes: it vanishes, also, if we take away the prism: but so long as the sun and the prism--God
and man--remain in their mutual relation, so long must the rainbow nature appear. Nature, in
short, is not God; neither is it man; but it is the inevitable concomitant or expression of
the creative attitude of God towards man. It is the shadow of the elements of which humanity
or human nature is composed: or, shall we say, it is the apparition in sense of the spiritual
being of mankind,--not, be it observed, of the being of any individual or of any aggregation
of individuals; but of humanity as a whole. For this reason, also, is nature orderly, complete,
and permanent,--that it is conditioned not upon our frail and faulty personalities, but upon
our impersonal, universal human nature, in which is transacted the miracle of God's incarnation,
and through which He forever shines.

Besides Creator and creature, nothing else can be; and whatever else seems to be, must be only
a seeming. Nature, therefore, is the shadow of a shade, but it serves an indispensable use.
For since there can be no direct communication between finite and Infinite--God and man--a
medium or common ground is needed, where they may meet; and nature, the shadow which the Infinite
causes the finite to project, is just that medium. Man, looking upon this shadow, mistakes
it for real substance, serving him for foothold and background, and assisting him to attain
self-consciousness. God, on the other hand, finds in nature the means of revealing Himself
to His creature without compromising the creature's freedom. Man supposes the universe to be
a physical structure made by God in space and time, and in some region of which He resides,
at a safe distance from us His creatures: whereas, in truth, God is distant from us only so
far as we remove ourselves from our own inmost intuitions of truth and good.

But what is that substance or quality which underlies and gives homogeneity to the varying
forms of nature, so that they seem to us to own a common origin?--what is that logical abstraction
upon which we have bestowed the name of matter? scientific analysis finds matter only as forms,
never as itself: until, in despair, it invents an atomic theory, and lets it go at that. But
if, discarding the scientific method, we question matter from the philosophical standpoint,
we shall find it less obdurate.

Man, considered as a mind or spirit, consists of volition and intelligence; or, what is the
same, of emotion or affection, and of the thoughts which are created by this affection. Nothing
can be affirmed of man as a spirit which does not fall under one or other of these two parts.
Now, a creature consisting solely of affections and thoughts must, of course, have something
to love and to think about. Man's final destiny is no doubt to love and consider his Creator;
but that can only be after a reactionary or regenerative process has begun in him. Meanwhile,
he must love and consider the only other available object--that is, himself. Manifestly, however,
in order to bestow this attention upon himself, he must first be made aware of his own existence.
In order to effect this, something must be added to man as spirit, enabling him to discriminate
between the subject thinking and loving, and the object loved and thought of. This additional
something, again, in order to fulfill its purpose, must be so devised as not to appear an addition:
it must seem even more truly the man than the man himself. It must, therefore, perfectly represent
or correspond to the spiritual form and constitution; so that the thoughts and affections of
the spirit may enter into it as into their natural home and continent.

This continent or vehicle of the mind is the human body. The body has two aspects,--substance
and form, answering to the two aspects of the mind,-- affection and thought: and affection
finds its incarnation or correspondence in substance; and thought, in form. The mind, in short,
realizes itself in terms of its reflection in the body, much as the body realizes itself in
terms of its reflection in the looking-glass: but it does more than this, for it identifies
itself with this its image. And how is this identification made possible?

It is brought about by the deception of sense, which is the medium of communication between
the spiritual and the material man. Until this miraculous medium is put in action, there can
be no conscious relation between these two planes, admirably as they are adapted to each other.
Sense is spiritual on one side and material on the other: but it is only on the material side
that it gathers its reports: on the spiritual side it only delivers them. Every one of the
five messengers whereby we are apprised of external existence brings us an earthly message
only. And since these messengers act spontaneously, and since the mind's only other source
of knowledge is intuition, which cannot be sensuously confirmed,-- it is little wonder if man
has inclined to the persuasion that what is highest in him is but an attribute of what is lowest,
and that when the body dies, the soul must follow it into nothingness.

Creative energy, being infinite, passes through the world of causes to the world of effects--through
the spiritual to the physical plane. Matter is therefore the symbol of the ultimate of creative
activity; it is the negative of God. As God is infinite, matter is finite; as He is life, it
is death; as He is real, it is unreal; as He reveals, matter veils. And as the relation of
God to man's spirit is constant and eternal, so is the physical quality of matter fixed and
permanent. Now, in order to arrive at a comprehension of what matter is in itself, let us descend
from the general to the specific, and investigate the philosophical elements of a pebble, for
instance. A pebble is two things: it is a mineral: and it is a particular concrete example
of mineral. In its mineral aspect, it is out of space and time, and is--not a fact, but--a
truth; a perception of the mind. In so far as it is mineral, therefore, it has no relation
to sense, but only to thought: and on the other hand, in so far as it is a particular concrete
pebble, it is cognizable by sense but not by thought; for what is in sense is out of thought:
the one supersedes the other. But if sense thus absorbs matter, so as to be philosophically
indistinguishable from it, we are constrained to identify matter with our sensuous perception
of it: and if our exemplary pebble had nothing but its material quality to depend upon, it
would cease to exist not only to thought, but to sense likewise. Its metaphysical aspect, in
short, is the only reality appertaining to it. Matter, then, may be defined as the impact upon
sense of that prismatic ray which we have called nature.

To apply this discussion to the subject in hand: Magic is a sort of parody of reality. And
when we recognize that Creation proceeds from within outwards, or endogenously; and that matter
is not the objective but the subjective side of the universe, we are in a position to perceive
that in order magically to control matter, we must apply our efforts not to matter itself,
but to our own minds. The natural world affects us from without inwards: the magical world
affects us from within outwards: instead of objects suggesting ideas, ideas are made to suggest
objects. And as, in the former case, when the object is removed the idea vanishes; so in the
latter case, when the idea is removed, the object vanishes. Both objects are illusions; but
the illusion in the first instance is the normal illusion of sense, whereas in the second instance
it is the abnormal illusion of mind.

The above argument can at best serve only as a hint to such as incline seriously to investigate
the subject, and perhaps as a touchstone for testing the validity of a large and noisy mass
of pretensions which engage the student at the outset of his enquiry. Many of these pretensions
are the result of ignorance; many of deliberate intent to deceive; some, again, of erroneous
philosophical theories. The Tibetan adepts seem to belong either to the second or to the last
of these categories,--or, perhaps, to an impartial mingling of all three. They import a cumbrous
machinery of auras, astral bodies, and elemental spirits; they divide man into seven principles,
nature into seven kingdoms; they regard spirit as a refined form of matter, and matter as the
one absolute fact of the universe,--the alpha and omega of all things. They deny a supreme
Deity, but hold out hopes of a practical deityship for the majority of the human race. In short,
their philosophy appeals to the most evil instincts of the soul, and has the air of being ex-post-facto;
whenever they run foul of a prodigy, they invent arbitrarily a fanciful explanation of it.
But it will be found, I think, that the various phases of hypnotism, and a systematized use
of spiritism, will amply account for every miracle they actually bring to pass.

Upon the whole, a certain vulgarity is inseparable from even the most respectable forms of
magic,--an atmosphere of tinsel, of ostentation, of big cry and little wool. A child might
have told us that matter is not almighty, that minds are sometimes transparent to one another,
that love and faith can work wonders. And we also know that, in this mortal life, our means
are exquisitely adapted to our ends; and that we can gain no solid comfort or advantage by
striving to elbow our way a few inches further into the region of the occult and abnormal.
Magic, however specious its achievements, is only a mockery of the Creative power, and exposes
its unlikeness to it. "It is the attribute of natural existence," a profound writer has said,
"to be a form of use to something higher than itself, so that whatever does not, either potentially
or actually, possess within it this soul of use, does not honestly belong to nature, but is
a sensational effect produced upon the individual intelligence." [Footnote: Henry James, in
"Society the Redeemed Form of Man."]

No one can overstep the order and modesty of general existence without bringing himself into
perilous proximity to subjects more profound and sacred than the occasion warrants. Life need
not be barren of mystery and miracle to any one of us; but they shall be such tender mysteries
and instructive miracles as the devotion of motherhood, and the blooming of spring. We are
too close to Infinite love and wisdom to play pranks before it, and provoke comparison between
our paltry juggleries and its omnipotence and majesty.

CHAPTER XI.

AMERICAN WILD ANIMALS IN ART.

The hunter and the sportsman are two very different persons. The hunter pursues animals because
he loves them and sympathizes with them, and kills them as the champions of chivalry used to
slay one another--courteously, fairly, and with admiration and respect. To stalk and shoot
the elk and the grizzly bear is to him what wooing and winning a beloved maiden would be to
another man. Far from being the foe or exterminator of the game he follows, he, more than any
one else, is their friend, vindicator, and confidant. A strange mutual ardor and understanding
unites him with his quarry. He loves the mountain sheep and the antelope, because they can
escape him; the panther and the bear, because they can destroy him. His relations with them
are clean, generous, and manly. And on the other hand, the wild animals whose wildness can
never be tamed, whose inmost principle of existence it is to be apart and unapproachable,--those
creatures who may be said to cease to be when they cease to be intractable,--seem, after they
have eluded their pursuer to the utmost, or fought him to the death, to yield themselves to
him with a sort of wild contentment--as if they were glad to admit the sovereignty of man,
though death come with the admission. The hunter, in short, asks for his happiness only to
be alone with what he hunts; the sportsman, after his day's sport, must needs hasten home to
publish the size of the "bag," and to wring from his fellow-men the glory and applause which
he has not the strength and simplicity to find in the game itself.

But if the true hunter is rare, the union of the hunter and the artist is rarer still. It demands
not only the close familiarity, the loving observation, and the sympathy, but also the faculty
of creation--the eye which selects what is constructive and beautiful, and passes over what
is superfluous and inharmonious, and the hand skilful to carry out what the imagination conceives.
In the man whose work I am about to consider, these qualities are developed in a remarkable
degree, though it was not until he was a man grown, and had fought with distinction through
the civil war, that he himself became aware of the artistic power that was in him. The events
of his life, could they be rehearsed here, would form a tale of adventure and vicissitude more
varied and stirring than is often found in fiction. He has spent by himself days and weeks
in the vast solitudes of our western prairies and southern morasses. He has been the companion
of trappers and frontiersmen, the friend and comrade of Indians, sleeping side by side with
them in their wigwams, running the rapids in their canoes, and riding with them in the hunt.
He has met and overcome the panther and the grizzly single-handed, and has pursued the flying
cimmaron to the snowy summits of the Rocky Mountains, and brought back its crescent horns as
a trophy. He has fought and slain the gray wolf with no other weapons than his hands and teeth;
and at night he has lain concealed by lonely tarns, where the wild coyote came to patter and
bark and howl at the midnight moon. His name and achievements are familiar to the dwellers
in those savage regions, whose estimate of a man is based, not upon his social and financial
advantages, but upon what he is and can do. Yet he is not one who wears his merit outwardly.
His appearance, indeed, is striking; tall and athletic, broad-shouldered and stout-limbed,
with the long, elastic step of the moccasined Indian, and something of the Indian's reticence
and simplicity. But he can with difficulty be brought to allude to his adventures, and is reserved
almost to the point of ingenuity on all that concerns himself or redounds to his credit. It
is only in familiar converse with friends that the humor, the cultivation, the knowledge, and
the social charm of the man appear, and his marvellous gift of vivid and picturesque narration
discloses itself. But, in addition to all this, or above it all, he is the only great animal
sculptor of his time, the successor of the French Barye, and (as any one may satisfy himself
who will take the trouble to compare their works) the equal of that famous artist in scope
and treatment of animal subjects, and his superior in knowledge and in truth and power of conception.
It would be a poor compliment to call Edward Kemeys the American Barye; but Barye is the only
man whose animal sculptures can bear comparison with Mr. Kemeys's.

Of Mr. Kemeys's productions, a few are to be seen at his studio, 133 West Fifty-third Street,
New York city. These are the models, in clay or plaster, as they came fresh from the artist's
hand. From this condition they can either be enlarged to life or colossal size, for parks or
public buildings, or cast in bronze in their present dimensions for the enrichment of private
houses. Though this collection includes scarce a tithe of what the artist has produced, it
forms a series of groups and figures which, for truth to nature, artistic excellence, and originality,
are actually unique. So unique are they, indeed, that the uneducated eye does not at first
realize their really immense value. Nothing like this little sculpture gallery has been seen
before, and it is very improbable that there will ever again be a meeting of conditions and
qualities adequate to reproducing such an exhibition. For we see here not merely, nor chiefly,
the accurate representation of the animal's external aspect, but--what is vastly more difficult
to seize and portray--the essential animal character or temperament which controls and actuates
the animal's movements and behavior. Each one of Mr. Kemeys's figures gives not only the form
and proportions of the animal, according to the nicest anatomical studies and measurements,
but it is the speaking embodiment of profound insight into that animal's nature and knowledge
of its habits. The spectator cannot long examine it without feeling that he has learned much
more of its characteristics and genius than if he had been standing in front of the same animal's
cage at the Zoological Gardens; for here is an artist who understands how to translate pose
into meaning, and action into utterance, and to select those poses and actions which convey
the broadest and most comprehensive idea of the subject's prevailing traits. He not only knows
what posture or movement the anatomical structure of the animal renders possible, but he knows
precisely in what degree such posture or movement is modified by the animal's physical needs
and instincts. In other words, he always respects the modesty of nature, and never yields to
the temptation to be dramatic and impressive at the expense of truth. Here is none of Barye's
exaggeration, or of Landseer's sentimental effort to humanize animal nature. Mr. Kemeys has
rightly perceived that animal nature is not a mere contraction of human nature; but that each
animal, so far as it owns any relation to man at all, represents the unimpeded development
of some particular element of man's nature. Accordingly, animals must be studied and portrayed
solely upon their own basis and within their own limits; and he who approaches them with this
understanding will find, possibly to his surprise, that the theatre thus afforded is wide and
varied enough for the exercise of his best ingenuity and capacities. At first, no doubt, the
simple animal appears too simple to be made artistically interesting, apart from this or that
conventional or imaginative addition. The lion must be presented, not as he is, but as vulgar
anticipation expects him to be; not with the savageness and terror which are native to him,
but with the savageness and terror which those who have trembled and fled at the echo of his
roar invest him with,--which are quite another matter. Zoological gardens and museums have
their uses, but they cannot introduce us to wild animals as they really are; and the reports
of those who have caught terrified or ignorant glimpses of them in their native regions will
mislead us no less in another direction. Nature reveals her secrets only to those who have
faithfully and rigorously submitted to the initiation; but to them she shows herself marvellous
and inexhaustible. The "simple animal" avouches his ability to transcend any imaginative conception
of him. The stern economy of his structure and character, the sureness and sufficiency of his
every manifestation, the instinct and capacity which inform all his proceedings,--these are
things which are concealed from a hasty glance by the very perfection of their state. Once
seen and comprehended, however, they work upon the mind of the observer with an ever increasing
power; they lead him into a new, strange, and fascinating world, and generously recompense
him for any effort he may have made to penetrate thither. Of that strange and fascinating world
Mr. Kemeys is the true and worthy interpreter, and, so far as appears, the only one. Through
difficulty and discouragement of all kinds, he has kept to the simple truth, and the truth
has rewarded him. He has done a service of incalculable value to his country, not only in vindicating
American art, but in preserving to us, in a permanent and beautiful form, the vivid and veracious
figures of a wild fauna which, in the inevitable progress of colonization and civilization,
is destined within a few years to vanish altogether. The American bear and bison, the cimmaron
and the elk, the wolf and the 'coon--where will they be a generation hence? Nowhere, save in
the possession of those persons who have to-day the opportunity and the intelligence to decorate
their rooms and parks with Mr. Kemeys's inimitable bronzes. The opportunity is great--much
greater, I should think, than the intelligence necessary for availing ourselves of it; and
it is a unique opportunity. In other words, it lies within the power of every cultivated family
in the United States to enrich itself with a work of art which is entirely American; which,
as art, fulfils every requirement; which is of permanent and increasing interest and value
from an ornamental point of view; and which is embodied in the most enduring of artistic materials.

The studio in which Mr. Kemeys works--a spacious apartment--is, in appearance, a cross between
a barn-loft and a wigwam. Round the walls are suspended the hides, the heads, and the horns
of the animals which the hunter has shot; and below are groups, single figures, and busts,
modelled by the artist, in plaster, terracotta, or clay. The colossal design of the "Still
Hunt"--an American panther crouching before its spring--was modelled here, before being cast
in bronze and removed to its present site in Central Park. It is a monument of which New York
and America may be proud; for no such powerful and veracious conception of a wild animal has
ever before found artistic embodiment. The great cat crouches with head low, extended throat,
and ears erect. The shoulders are drawn far back, the fore paws huddled beneath the jaws. The
long, lithe back rises in an arch in the middle, sinking thence to the haunches, while the
angry tail makes a strong curve along the ground to the right. The whole figure is tense and
compact with restrained and waiting power; the expression is stealthy, pitiless, and terrible;
it at once fascinates and astounds the beholder. While Mr. Kemeys was modelling this animal,
an incident occurred which he has told me in something like the following words. The artist
does not encourage the intrusion of idle persons while he is at work, though no one welcomes
intelligent inspection and criticism more cordially than he. On this occasion he was alone
in the studio with his Irish factotum, Tom, and the outer door, owing to the heat of the weather,
had been left ajar. All of a sudden the artist was aware of the presence of a stranger in the
room. "He was a tall, hulking fellow, shabbily dressed, like a tramp, and looked as if he might
make trouble if he had a mind to. However, he stood quite still in front of the statue, staring
at it, and not saying anything. So I let him alone for a while; I thought it would be time
enough to attend to him when he began to beg or make a row. But after some time, as he still
hadn't stirred, Tom came to the conclusion that a hint had better be given him to move on;
so he took a broom and began sweeping the floor, and the dust went all over the fellow; but
he didn't pay the least attention. I began to think there would probably be a fight; but I
thought I'd wait a little longer before doing anything. At last I said to him, 'Will you move
aside, please? You're in my way.' He stepped over a little to the right, but still didn't open
his mouth, and kept his eyes fixed on the panther. Presently I said to Tom, 'Well, Tom, the
cheek of some people passes belief!' Tom replied with more clouds of dust; but the stranger
never made a sign. At last I got tired, so I stepped up to the fellow and said to him: 'Look
here, my friend, when I asked you to move aside, I meant you should move the other side of
the door.' He roused up then, and gave himself a shake, and took a last look at the panther,
and said he, 'That's all right, boss; I know all about the door; but--what a spring she's going
to make!' Then," added Kemeys, self-reproachfully, "I could have wept!"

But although this superb figure no longer dominates the studio, there is no lack of models
as valuable and as interesting, though not of heroic size. Most interesting of all to the general
observer are, perhaps, the two figures of the grizzly bear. These were designed from a grizzly
which Mr. Kemeys fought and killed in the autumn of 1881 in the Rocky Mountains, and the mounted
head of which grins upon the wall overhead, a grisly trophy indeed. The impression of enormous
strength, massive yet elastic, ponderous yet alert, impregnable for defence as irresistible
in attack; a strength which knows no obstacles, and which never meets its match,--this impression
is as fully conveyed in these figures, which are not over a foot in height, as if the animal
were before us in its natural size. You see the vast limbs, crooked with power, bound about
with huge ropes and plates of muscle, and clothed in shaggy depths of fur; the vast breadth
of the head, with its thick, low ears, dull, small eyes, and long up-curving snout; the roll
and lunge of the gait, like the motion of a vessel plunging forward before the wind; the rounded
immensity of the trunk, and the huge bluntness of the posteriors; and all these features are
combined with such masterly unity of conception and plastic vigor, that the diminutive model
insensibly grows mighty beneath your gaze, until you realize the monster as if he stood stupendous
and grim before you. In the first of the figures the bear has paused in his great stride to
paw over and snuff at the horned head of a mountain sheep, half buried in the soil. The action
of the right arm and shoulder, and the burly slouch of the arrested stride, are of themselves
worth a gallery of pseudo-classic Venuses and Roman senators. The other bear is lolling back
on his haunches, with all four paws in the air, munching some grapes from a vine which he has
torn from its support. The contrast between the savage character of the beast and his absurdly
peaceful employment gives a touch of terrific comedy to this design. After studying these figures,
one cannot help thinking what a noble embellishment either of them would be, put in bronze,
of colossal size, in the public grounds of one of our great Western cities. And inasmuch as
the rich citizens of the West not only know what a grizzly bear is, but are more fearless and
independent, and therefore often more correct in their artistic opinion than the somewhat sophisticated
critics of the East, there is some cause for hoping that this thing may be brought to pass.

Beside the grizzly stands the mountain sheep, or cimmaron, the most difficult to capture of
all four-footed animals, whose gigantic curved horns are the best trophy of skill and enterprise
that a hunter can bring home with him. The sculptor has here caught him in one of his most
characteristic attitudes--just alighted from some dizzy leap on the headlong slope of a rocky
mountainside. On such a spot nothing but the cimmaron could retain its footing; yet there he
stands, firm and secure as the rock itself, his fore feet planted close together, the fore
legs rigid and straight as the shaft of a lance, while the hind legs pose easily in attendance
upon them. "The cimmaron always strikes plumb-centre, and he never makes a mistake," is Mr.
Kemeys's laconic comment; and we can recognize the truth of the observation in this image.
Perfectly at home and comfortable on its almost impossible perch, the cimmaron curves its great
neck and turns its head upward, gazing aloft toward the height whence it has descended. "It's
the golden eagle he hears," says the sculptor; "they give him warning of danger." It is a magnificent
animal, a model of tireless vigor in all its parts; a creature made to hurl itself head-foremost
down appalling gulfs of space, and poise itself at the bottom as jauntily as if gravitation
were but a bugbear of timid imaginations. I find myself unconsciously speaking about these
plaster models as if they were the living animals which they represent; but the more one studies
Mr. Kemeys's works, the more instinct with redundant and breathing life do they appear.

It would be impossible even to catalogue the contents of this studio, the greater part of which
is as well worth describing as those examples which have already been touched upon; nor could
a more graphic pen than mine convey an adequate impression of their excellence. But there is
here a figure of the 'coon, which, as it is the only one ever modelled, ought not to be passed
over in silence. In appearance this animal is a curious medley of the fox, the wolf, and the
bear, besides I-know-not-what (as the lady in "Punch" would say) that belongs to none of those
beasts. As may be imagined, therefore, its right portrayal involves peculiar difficulties,
and Mr. Kemeys's genius is nowhere better shown than in the manner in which these have been
surmounted. Compact, plump, and active in figure, quick and subtle in its movements, the 'coon
crouches in a flattened position along the limb of a tree, its broad, shallow head and pointed
snout a little lifted, as it gazes alertly outward and downward. It sustains itself by the
clutch of its slender-clawed toes on the branch, the fore legs being spread apart, while the
left hind leg is withdrawn inward, and enters smoothly into the contour of the furred side;
the bushy, fox-like tail, ringed with dark and light bands, curving to the left. Thus posed
and modelled in high relief on a tile-shaped plaque, Mr. Kemeys's coon forms a most desirable
ornament for some wise man's sideboard or mantle-piece, where it may one day be pointed out
as the only surviving representative of its species.

The two most elaborate groups here have already attained some measure of publicity; the "Bison
and Wolves" having been exhibited in the Paris Salon in 1878, and the "Deer and Panther" having
been purchased in bronze by Mr. Winans during the sculptor's sojourn in England. Each group
represents one of those deadly combats between wild beasts which are among the most terrific
and at the same time most natural incidents of animal existence; and they are of especial interest
as showing the artist's power of concentrated and graphic composition. A complicated story
is told in both these instances with a masterly economy of material and balance of proportion;
so that the spectator's eye takes in the whole subject at a glance, and yet finds inexhaustible
interest in the examination of details, all of which contribute to the central effect without
distracting the attention. A companion piece to the "Deer and Panther" shows the same animals
as they have fallen, locked together in death after the combat is over. In the former group,
the panther, in springing upon the deer, had impaled its neck on the deer's right antler, and
had then swung round under the latter's body, burying the claws of its right fore foot in the
ruminant's throat. In order truthfully to represent the second stage of the encounter, therefore,
it was necessary not merely to model a second group, but to retain the elements and construction
of the first group under totally changed conditions. This is a feat of such peculiar difficulty
that I think few artists in any branch of art would venture to attempt it; nevertheless, Mr.
Kemeys has accomplished it; and the more the two groups are studied in connection with each
other, the more complete will his success be found to have been. The man who can do this may
surely be admitted a master, whose works are open only to affirmative criticism. For his works
the most trying of all tests is their comparison with one another; and the result of such comparison
is not merely to confirm their merit, but to illustrate and enhance it.

For my own part, my introduction to Mr. Kemeys's studio was the opening to me of a new world,
where it has been my good fortune to spend many days of delightful and enlightening study.
How far the subject of this writing may have been already familiar to the readers of it, I
have no means of knowing; but I conceive it to be no less than my duty, as a countryman of
Mr. Kemeys's and a lover of all that is true and original in art, to pay the tribute of my
appreciation to what he has done. There is no danger of his getting more recognition than he
deserves, and he is not one whom recognition can injure. He reverences his art too highly to
magnify his own exposition of it; and when he reads what I have set down here, he will smile
and shake his head, and mutter that I have divined the perfect idea in the imperfect embodiment.
Unless I greatly err, however, no one but himself is competent to take that exception. The
genuine artist is never satisfied with his work; he perceives where it falls short of his conception.
But to others it will not be incomplete; for the achievements of real art are always invested
with an atmosphere and aroma--a spiritual quality perhaps--proceeding from the artist's mind
and affecting that of the beholder. And thus it happens that the story or the poem, the picture
or the sculpture, receives even in its material form that last indefinable grace, that magic
light that never was on sea or land, which no pen or brush or graving-tool has skill to seize.
Matter can never rise to the height of spirit; but spirit informs it when it has done its best,
and ennobles it with the charm that the artist sought and the world desired.
