15 Dr. Tobias Pullen (1648-1713) was made Bishop of Dromore in 1695.

16 Lord Charles Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, died unmarried in 1739. When his father, William,
first Earl of Selkirk, married Anne, Duchess of Hamilton, the Duchess obtained for her husband,
in 1660, the title of Duke of Hamilton, for life. James II. conferred the Earldom of Selkirk
on his Grace's second and younger sons, primogenitively; and the second son having died without
issue, the third, Charles, became Earl. The fifth son, George, was created Earl of Orkney (see
Letter 52, note 5). The difference between Lord Selkirk and the Earl of Abercorn (see Letter
10, note 33) to which Swift alludes was in connection with the claim to the Dukedom of Chatelherault
(see Letter 43, note 32).

24 We are told in the Wentworth Papers, p. 268, that the Duchess of Shrewsbury remarked to
Lady Oxford, "Madam, I and my Lord are so weary of talking politics; what are you and your
Lord?" whereupon Lady Oxford sighed and said she knew no Lord but the Lord Jehovah. The Duchess
rejoined, "Oh, dear! Madam, who is that? I believe 'tis one of the new titles, for I never
heard of him before."

25 A thousand merry new years. The words are much obliterated.

29 Burnet (History, iv. 382) says that the Duc d'Aumont was "a goodnatured and generous man,
of profuse expense, throwing handfuls of money often out of his coach as he went about the
streets. He was not thought a man of business, and seemed to employ himself chiefly in maintaining
the dignity of his character and making himself acceptable to the nation."

11 In the Examiner for Jan. 5 to 9, 1712(-13), there is an account of the game of Similitudes.
One person thinks of a subject, and the others, not knowing what it is, name similitudes, and
when the subject is proclaimed, must make good the comparisons. On the occasion described,
the subject chosen was Faction. The prize was given to a Dutchman, who argued that Faction
was like butter, because too much fire spoiled its consistency.

20 "Her Majesty is all goodness and tenderness to her people and her Allies. She has now prorogued
the best Parliament that ever assembled in her reign and respited her own glory, and the wishes,
prayers, and wants of her people, only to give some of her Allies an opportunity to think of
the returns they owe her, and try if there be such a thing as gratitude, justice, or humanity
in Europe. The conduct of Her Majesty is without parallel. Never was so great a condescension
made to the unreasonable clamours of an insolent faction now dwindled to the most contemptible
circumstances."--Examiner, Jan. 12-16, 1712(-13).

25 Writing in October 1713, Lord Berkeley of Stratton told Lord Strafford of "a fine prank
of the widow Lady Jersey" (see Letter 29, note 3). "It is well known her lord died much in
debt, and she, after taking upon her the administration, sold everything and made what money
she could, and is run away into France without paying a farthing of the debts, with only one
servant and unknown to all her friends, and hath taken her youngest son, as 'tis supposed to
make herself a merit in breeding him a papist. My Lord Bolingbroke sent after her, but too
late, and they say the Queen hath writ a letter with her own hand to the King of France to
send back the boy" (Wentworth Papers, p. 357). See also Letter 63, note 8. I am not sure whether
in the present passage Swift is referring to the widow or the younger Lady Jersey (see Letter
33, note 10).

26 Sir Thomas Clarges, Bart. (died 1759), M.P. for Lostwithiel, married Barbara, youngest daughter
of John Berkeley, fourth Viscount Fitz-Hardinge, and of Barbara Villiers (see Letter 54, note
11), daughter of Sir Edward Villiers.

27 See Letter 43, Mar. 21, 1711-12 and Letter 49, Jul. 1, 1712.

28 Altered from "11" in the MS. It is not certain where the error in the dates began; but the
entry of the 6th must be correctly dated, because the Feb. 6 was the Queen's Birthday.

5 Peter Wentworth wrote to Lord Strafford, on Feb. 17, 1713, "Poor Mr. Harrison is very much
lamented; he died last Saturday. Dr. Swift told me that he had told him... he owed about 300
pounds, and the Queen owed him 500 pounds, and that if you or some of your people could send
an account of his debts, that I might give it to him, he would undertake to solicit Lord Treasurer
and get this 500 pounds, and give the remainder to his mother and sister" (Wentworth Papers, 320).

6 George St. John (eldest son of Sir Harry St. John by his second marriage) was Secretary to
the English Plenipotentiaries at Utrecht. He died at Venice in 1716 (Lady Cowper's Diary, 65).

7 Forster wrongly reads, "poor."

8 "Putt" (MS.).

9 See Letter 59, note 26.

10 Montagu Bertie, second Earl of Abingdon (died 1743), was a strong Tory.

11 See Letter 11, note 61. These friends were together again on an expedition to Bath in 1715,
when Jervas wrote to Pope (Aug. 12, 1715) that Arbuthnot, Disney, and he were to meet at Hyde
Park Corner, proceed to Mr. Hill's at Egham, meet Pope next day, and then go to Lord Stawell's
to lodge the night. Lord Stawell's seat, Aldermaston, was seventeen miles from Binfield.

16 Victor Marie, duc d'Estrees, Marshal of France (died 1727).

17 See Letter 55, note 18.

18 Several words are obliterated. Forster reads, "the last word, God 'give me"; but "'give
me" is certainly wrong.

19 See Letter 9, note 13. Sir Thomas Hanmer married, in 1698, at the age of twenty-two, Isabella,
Dowager Duchess of Grafton, daughter of Henry, Earl of Arlington, and Countess of Arlington
in her own right. Hanmer was not made Secretary of State, but he succeeded Bromley as Speaker
of the House of Commons.

20 William Fitzmaurice (see Letter 11, note 19 and Letter 27, note 11) entered Christ Church,
Oxford, matriculating on March 10, 1712-13, at the age of eighteen.

21 See Letter 11, note 11.

22 William Bromley, second son of Bromley the Speaker (see Letter 10, note 1), was a boy of
fourteen at this time. In 1727 he was elected M.P. for Warwick, and he died in 1737, shortly
after being elected Member for Oxford University.

23 See Letter 14, note 12.

24 Sometimes "list" means to border or edge; at others, to sew together, so as to make a variegated
display, or to form a border. Probably it here means the curling of the bottom of the wig.

25 The last eight words have been much obliterated, and the reading is doubtful. Lord Dalkeith
died in 1705, leaving a son, who succeeded his grandmother (Monmouth's widow) as second Duke
of Buccleuch. Lady Catherine Hyde (see Letter 40, note 6) was a younger sister of Lady Dalkeith.

27 Swift first wrote "I frequent."

was hired for that day, where there was a fine ball and entertainment; and it is reported in
town, that a great lady, lately gone to travel, left one hundred guineas, with orders that
it should be spent in that manner, and in that house" (Postboy, Feb. 26-28, 1712-13). The "great
lady" was, presumably, the Duchess of Marlborough.

16 A deal at cards, that draws the whole tricks.

17 Previous editors have misread "Trevor" as "Treasurer." Thomas Trevor, Chief-Justice of the
Common Pleas, was created Baron Trevor, of Bromham, in January 1712. By commission of March
9, 1713, he occupied the woolsack during the illness of the Lord Keeper, Harcourt.

18 This is the only reference to Pope in the Journal. In his "Windsor Forest" the young poet
assisted the Tories by his reference to the peace of Utrecht, then awaiting ratification.

19 Several words have been obliterated. Forster reads, "Rove Pdfr, poo Pdfr, Nite MD MD MD,"
but this is more than the space would contain.

20 William Oldisworth (1680-1734), a Tory journalist and pamphleteer, who published various
works, including a translation of the Iliad. He died in a debtors' prison.

21 Some words obliterated. The reading is Forster's, and seems to be correct.

22 Susan Armine, elder daughter of Sir William Armine, Bart., of Osgodby, Lincolnshire, was
created a life peeress in 1674, as Baroness Belasyse of Osgodby. She died March 6, 1713. Her
first husband was the Honourable Sir Henry Belasyse, son and heir of John, Baron Belasyse,
of Worlaby; and her second, Mr. Fortney, of Chequers.

23 See Letter 7, note 9.

24 A word before "Ppt" is illegible. Forster's reading, "yes," does not seem right.

25 In November 1711 it was reported that Miss Kingdom was privately married to Lord Conway
(Wentworth Papers, 207), but this was not the case. Lord Conway was a widower in 1713, but
he married an Irish lady named Bowden.

26 Forster reads, "Nite, my own dee sollahs. Pdfr roves MD"; but the last three words, at least,
do not seem to be in the MS.

27 Probably the Bishop of Raphoe's son (see Letter 29, note 20).

6 A dozen words are erased. The reading is Forster's, and appears to be correct.

7 The British Ambassadress's Speech to the French King. The printer was sent to the pillory
and fined.

8 The Examiner (vol. iii. No. 35) said that Swift--"a gentleman of the first character for
learning, good sense, wit, and more virtues than even they can set off and illustrate"--was
not the author of that periodical. "Out of pure regard to justice, I strip myself of all the
honour that lucky untruth did this paper."

9 A purgative electuary.

10 Bargains.

11 Three or four words illegible. Forster reads, "Nite, nite, own MD."

12 Forster reads, "devil's brood "; probably the second word is "bawd:" Cf. Letter 60, note
14 and Feb. 18, 1712-13.
