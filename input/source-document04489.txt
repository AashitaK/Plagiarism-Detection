The Scotchman also was unwearied in his attention to my comfort. Did the snow blow in upon
me? He would lower the curtain. Did I wish more air? he would raise it again. Were my feet
becoming chilled? He would tuck in the buffalo. Between the two I fared certainly as comfortably
as circumstances would permit.

The weather was still mild, though colder than before. As the day wore on, the wind began to
rise, and I observed frequent eddies and whirlwinds of snow and ominous grooves around every
wayside stone. Would the storm increase and drift? In that case my chance of getting to Bangor
in time was doubtful enough.

We reached our next stopping place at half past four, P.M. It was a weather-stained house,
which we must have entered by the back door, for we passed into the kitchen at once, where
were a stout, pleasant-faced woman, with two stout, pleasant-faced daughters, and a big fat
yellow dog, who sat up in a chair beside them at the window, as though he were indeed a part
of the family. We were ushered into a small room beyond, which rejoiced in another glorious
wood fire, before which the Englishman duly planted me, and the Scotchman my plank and brick.
Over the mantel was another version of the sepulchral monument with the weeping woman and willow,
in whimsical contrast with the jolly, rollicking fire beneath, which gave us such a hearty welcome.

As we sat luxuriating in the warmth, the two fat girls in the kitchen began to vocalize with
low sweet voices that harmonized pleasantly, 'Do, re, mi, si, la, si, do.' Evidently there
had been a singing school in the neighborhood. Presently they struck into 'Marching Along,'
which they sang with considerable spirit.

In the mean time, an overgrown youth, apparently belonging to the house, who sat in one corner,
tilting his chair, said, addressing all of us at once, 'Wal, you've got the wust half the road
before yer now. Thur's a hill a mile an' a half long, jest out here a little ways. You'll have
to break yer own roads, I reckon; there's nothin' else goin' along to-day. Storm's gittin' wuss.'

We looked dubiously at each other, and he, probably observing my anxious countenance, endeavored
to reassure us by saying, in an uncertain tone, 'But I rayther guess you'll git through.'

We were soon off again on the next stage, which was to be twenty-four miles, without any stopping-place
or village between. We ascended many hills, in fact there seemed to be no going down to any
of them; but when the horses came to a dead halt, and the coach began to slip backward, and
the driver called out, 'I guess, gentlemen, you'll hev to git out here for a spell,' we knew
we had come to the hill 'a mile an' a half long.' I kept my place, for my weight was too inconsiderable
to make much difference. The Englishman, taking hold of the coach, helped the horses to start
again with a vigorous push, and then the three passengers went plunging through the snow till
the driver stopped and took them in again, quite out of breath.

We were now in the depths of the forest, many miles from any house. Occasionally we passed
a deserted lumberman's hut by the wayside, and discussed the liability of a breakdown or an
overturn in that wild region.

The white-headed, square-faced stumps which abounded in the partially cleared tracts, peered
in upon us for mile after mile with haunting repetition.

The trees were heavily laden with snow, which they shook down upon us as we brushed along beneath
their low-bending branches. In the dim twilight they assumed every variety of fanciful form.
There were gaunt old trees, with gnarled and twisted branches, outstretched like arms in deadly
Laocoon-like struggle with the writhing winds and storms; there were delicate birches, each
slender twig bearing its feathery burden; and there were spruces and hemlocks, regal in snowy
splendor. It lay upon them in heavy masses, and gave their bending boughs a still more graceful
dip. There was something which harmonized with my grief in the silent snow and the drooping
trees. They sank beneath the snow as the human heart sinks beneath its burden of sorrow. Yet
it fell gently and beautifully upon them, as affliction falls from the hand of our Father,
'who chasteneth whom he loveth.' One tree, which bent completely over in a perfect abandonment
of grief, particularly impressed me. There was something in the sweep of the branches which
suggested the utter prostration of the heart beneath the first shock of a great affliction.

How still it was! It was not dark, for the moon had risen, and the clouds were thin. The snow,
too, made it lighter.

It was at this solemn, awe-inspiring hour that my companions first learned the object of my
journey. The sympathy with which they met me did honor to human nature.

'I thought,' said the Englishman, 'that the urgency of my own journey was great, but it is
nothing compared to yours.'

He apologized for any light or careless conversation in which they had indulged, not knowing
the circumstances of my journey, and entered fully into the sentiment which had prompted me
to undertake it. He assured me that he would see that I got through in time for the cars the
next morning, and begged me to feel no further uneasiness about it.

From that moment, both my companions were more assiduously devoted to my comfort than ever.
Their interest was increased on finding that my father was the son of a well-known inventor.

His history was soon told. He had inherited his father's business (now passed out of the family)
with something of his mechanical talent. Of a confiding disposition, he had been wronged by
those whom he had intrusted most extensively, and, property gone and strength failing, his
misfortunes, which he had at all times borne with exemplary patience and fortitude, had culminated
in the loss of his old home, the home of his father before him, by the hand of the incendiary.
He had left me a precious legacy in his memory, to which my present journey was an inadequate
tribute.

The hours wore on. It did not grow much darker, but oh, it was so still! You could hear the
stillness when the coach stopped, as occasionally it did.

It was there, in the depths of this remote wilderness, that our subdued voices mingled in those
grand old chorals which belong to the church universal, and in which, Methodist, Presbyterian,
and Unitarian as we were, we could all heartily join: 'Old Hundred,' so full of worship; 'Dundee,'
with its plaintive melody; and 'America,' breathing the soul of loyalty, whether sung to 'God
save the Queen,' or 'Our country, 'tis of thee.'

My voice was feeble, and soon gave out. I had come near fainting repeatedly, and had only been
resuscitated by the snow and the Englishman's brandy. I was now nearly exhausted.

'You had better make use of my shoulder as a pillow,' he said, perceiving my condition.

'You had better, by all means,' chimed in the Scotchman.

I hesitated a moment. What would Mrs. Grundy say--and my husband? I was too tired to care for
the former, and the latter, I knew, would be only grateful to my compassionate friends.

'Circumstances must dispense with ceremony,' I observed, suiting the action to the word.

'Madam,' rejoined the Englishman, with warmth, 'I hope you will find, before you get to the
end of your journey, that you are in honorable company.'

'I have found it out already,' I murmured, and then, committing myself to the care and keeping
of the Good Father, my last shadow of distrust vanished.

I was too weary to hold my eyelids open, and too much excited to sleep. At length I was aroused
by a sudden stop. The 'whippletree' had broken. In a few minutes we proceeded, the 'leader'
being still driven loosely, as before.

Again we came to a pause--this time to water the horses at a wayside spring. While the others
were refreshing themselves, the 'leader' quietly walked off, to the great indignation of the
driver, who began to swear as he chased him through the snow. He was captured at last, and
we continued on our way.

The poor Frenchman had by this time become so chilled that he was glad to come inside, though
by so doing he felt obliged to give up the luxury of his pipe.

All at once the striking difference in our nationalities occurred to me, and I exclaimed, on
the impulse of the moment:

'See, do we not represent the four leading nations of the earth--England, France, Scotland,
and America?'

'Yes,' replied the Englishman, with some hesitation in his manner; 'England is surely one of
the leading nations; so is France;'--(here the Frenchman broke in with some inarticulate jargon
to the glory of France)--'but Scotland--I don't know about that being a 'leading nation.''

This roused the Scotchman. 'Scotland has been a glorious nation! She has proud memories for
her sons!' he cried, with a fire of enthusiasm, not without pathos, in its unavoidable admission
that the glory of his country as an individual power in the world was past.

'That is right,' said I, admiring his sudden warmth; 'cling to your own country before all
others, come what may.'

The Englishman then reverted to the present lamentable condition of these United States, and
with characteristic complacency pointed to the stability and grandeur of his own Government.

It was in vain that I spoke of the future of our country, and represented our present troubles
to be, as I firmly believe, the means of our regeneration into a nobler and truer national
existence. His English prejudices were not to be shaken. England was, and would remain the
leading nation of the earth.

How much longer the discussion would have continued I know not, had we not caught sight of
lights, and driven up to a more pretentious mansion than we had yet seen on our way.

Scarcely able to stand, I alighted, and the landlord, seeing the lady, ushered us into the
parlor, which showed signs of approaching civilization in the large-figured Kiddermister carpet
and the 'air-tight' stove.

A fine-looking young man, whom they called 'Doctor,' in a gray suit with deep fur cuffs, sat
at a table, looking over a volume of house plans with a pretty young lady. Apparently the occupation
had been of absorbing interest, for the fire was nearly out, and the room was quite cold, and
the look with which they greeted our entrance betokened surprise rather than pleasure.

The Englishman made himself at home, and, not waiting to call a servant, procured three or
four sticks of wood from some unknown quarter, and began piling them into the stove. They burned
feebly, for the fire was very low indeed, and I still shivered; so, catching up the rocking
chair, he ran off with it into the other room.

'There's a good open fire out here,' said he; 'it doesn't look quite as tidy, perhaps, but
I guess you'll get warm.'

That was the main thing, to be sure; so I followed on. Here the fire was not so good as it
might have been, but by dint of a little bluster, a quantity of 'light-stuff' and more solid
fuel was soon forthcoming, and we shortly had a blaze almost strong enough to set the chimney
and my inevitable plank on fire. Here we wound our watches. After a little delay supper was
announced--fried beefsteaks, potatoes, and doughnuts.

This was the place where we were to exchange drivers, and where a delay of several hours frequently
occurred.

When we were about half through supper, which my travelling companions discussed with enviable
zeal, a short, stoutly built, sharp-visaged man appeared in the doorway, and cried out, 'All
ready!'

'Well, I'm not,' said the Englishman, looking up good-humoredly. With a muttered threat about
going on and leaving us, the new driver turned away, and we thought the prospect of getting
to Bangor in time had decidedly improved. Still, there were more than forty miles between.

'I will take one of your doughnuts, madam,' said I, putting it into my pocket, for I had been
able to eat but little.

'Certainly,' said the landlady; 'take as many as you wish.'

There was something in her kindly tone that did me good. It cheered and helped me more than
she could know.

We were to pay our passage here to the returning driver. I had secured a 'through ticket' at
C----, but my companions, having only English gold with them, had not done so, having been
assured by this same man that they could just as well pay at Bangor, where they would obtain
a higher premium on their money. Now, however, he demanded his pay, and at first was not disposed
to allow any premium for the gold. This, of course, excited their indignation, and some high
words passed. However, the matter was compromised by the driver giving them twenty per cent.,
when gold was at that moment worth fifty at Bangor.

I had stolen from the room, and was hastily putting on my numerous wrappings, when the Englishman
came to me with what he called a 'dose, which he thought would do me good.'

I took part of it, and then hesitated, for it contained strong reminiscences of the 'pocket
pistol.'

'Would you really advise me to take the rest?' said I gravely.

'I certainly would,' he replied, with conclusive solemnity. So I took it, and I think it did
'do me good.'

'This is a hard journey for you,' said the landlady, compassionately regarding my diminutive
stature and frail aspect.

The driver was very impatient. She half apologized for him, saying, 'He is very anxious to
get through to-night. He doesn't like to go through in the night always, for there are many
dangerous places along the road; but it is sleighing to-night, and not very dark, so he thinks
he can do very well.'

The urgency of my case, which the Englishman had represented to him, with what other inducements
I can only imagine, occasioned his unwonted haste.

When we entered the coach once more for the long night ride, one of the buffaloes was missing.

'It's over to the other stable,' said the driver, carelessly; 'twas left over there by mistake.
You shall have it when we get there.'

You would have thought, from his manner of speaking, that the 'other stable' was just across
the road, instead of being twenty miles away. As we drove away, I observed, 'I have a doughnut
in my pocket; the first one hungry shall have it.'

The curtains were now buttoned closely down for the first time, and we were in total darkness.
We rode in silence for some time, each resolutely trying to go to sleep. The Frenchman succeeded
best. He had served as a soldier on the Continent, and was evidently accustomed to hardship.
He slept as soundly as though he were on a down bed, instead of riding backward in a stage coach.

Again insensibility threatened me. I could not speak, but my labored breathing aroused my companions
just in time to save me from entire unconsciousness. The faithful Scotchman had raised the
curtain, and the air rushed in freshly upon me. It was very chilly, and much colder than it
had been. It had ceased snowing, and the moon was shining feebly through the breaking clouds.
We were going at a goodly rate of speed. By and by I thought of my doughnut, and inquired who
was hungry. The Scotchman was not; the Englishman was not; the Frenchman still slept.

'Give it to me, if you please,' said the Englishman, a sudden idea seeming to strike him.

'Here,' said he, making a thrust at the Frenchman; 'wake up! here's a doughnut for you.' The
old soldier muttered something drowsily. He was not hungry. 'Won't you take it for the lady?'
said the former, with a dash of sentiment.

'I only eat for the satisfacti-on of mine appétit!' he exclaimed, sulkily, settling himself
back again to sleep.

The night wore on, interrupted only by frequent stoppages, when the driver dismounted to apply
the 'drags' in going down the hills. Before this, we had seemed to be going up all the hills;
now there seemed to be a continual descent.

I was too weary to sleep. Let me change my position as I might, I could not be comfortable.
My mind was constantly busy, and, since outward objects could no longer engage my attention,
I could no longer escape my thoughts. At one time I would think of my husband and my five little
ones at home, all sleeping quietly in their beds. I wondered if they had all said their prayers
to their father, and if he had tucked them all up warmly. Then I would think of my mother.
Was she expecting me? I wondered. My poor mother! what a sad meeting that would be! And then
my dead father would come to mind. How sad, how strange it would seem, to receive no warm greeting
from him!

It was about two o'clock in the morning, when we stopped for our last change of horses. The
house stood black and sombre as a tomb in the dim moonlight. The family had evidently retired
to rest. At length we were admitted into a dimly lighted room, where a table was spread with
substantial food. The old gentleman, whose slumbers we had so ruthlessly disturbed, fumbled
among a pile of letters and papers, which he distributed in three monstrous mailbags, that
flapped about on the floor like so many whales out of water. His toilet had evidently been
hastily made, and he shuffled the letters and papers about with the manner of a person half
asleep. His hair, which was white and very abundant, stood erect all over his head, and contrasted
queerly with his nut-brown face, which was strongly marked and deeply wrinkled.

We were all sleepy and stupid enough by this time, and, had the Scotchman been a less chivalrous
knight than he had proved himself, I doubt not he would have experienced some satisfaction
in placing my plank and brick before the fire to heat for the last time.

We were none of us hungry but the sharp-visaged driver, who devoured his supper, or breakfast,
whichever it might be called, with the air of a man who was determined to get through to Bangor
before morning.

The Frenchman, who had been completely cowed down by the old gentleman's indignant 'No, sir!
we don't keep no sich stuff abaout these premises!' in reply to his demand for 'rum,' meekly
took refuge in a cup of coffee.

In the mean time a baby in the adjoining room, awakened by our movements, began to cry. It
was quite a young cry. It could not be more than three or four months old, I thought, as I
compared it mentally with the efforts of my own youngest in that direction. But the baby shoe
which hung by the fireplace betokened an older child. It must have been the old gentleman's
grandchild. I pitied its mother, for it might lie awake until morning.

Once more our resolute driver, with an authoritative 'All ready!' summoned us to depart.

'Amaziah, bring the light around here!' cried the Englishman, who seemed to know the names
of every one at these stopping places by a sort of intuition.

'Amaziah' promptly obeyed, and by the aid of his lantern I settled myself for the last stage
of my journey. To the Scotchman's comfort, the missing buffalo was produced here, according
to the driver's promise.

The Frenchman, who had been over the 'line' before, had hinted that four gray horses were to
take us into Bangor; but it seemed to be the fate of three only.

It was then not far from three o'clock, and we had more than twenty miles before us. As the
distance lessened, my excitement increased. I became so feverish that I could no longer bear
my mittens on my hands. Anxiety and fatigue produced a nervous exhaustion, and the harsh grating
of the 'drags' as we descended the oft-recurring hills, threw me into an uncontrollable tremor.
I was too tired to sleep--too tired, almost, to think. Strength, sense, hope seemed to lose
themselves in my utter weariness. It seemed at times to become a question whether I should
even live to reach my destination.

My companions cheered and comforted me as best they could, with never-to-be-forgotten kindness.
We stopped once to throw out a mailbag, and I thought, from the appearance of the place as
well as I could see it, that we were already on the outskirts of Bangor.

'What place is this?' the Englishman inquired.

'Eddington Bend,' replied the driver.

'How far from Bangor?'

'Sixteen miles.'

Toward dawn we all lost ourselves for a few minutes. I first aroused, and, through the interstices
beside the curtains, perceived the gray light of morning. It was six o'clock, and we were but
four miles from Bangor, the driver informed us.

Only four miles! but how long they seemed! The cars left at half past seven o'clock, and the
daylight was fast advancing.

'Shall we after all get there in time?' said I.

'Not in time for breakfast, I imagine,' replied the Englishman, resignedly.

At last came the welcome announcement, 'Bangor! There is Bangor!'

'Where is it? I do not see it,' said I, looking eagerly out into the gray morning mist.

'Why, there, to be sure! Don't you see that steeple? There's another! and there's another!'

Yes, surely there was Bangor at last, welcome to me as ever the Holy City to the penance-worn
pilgrim.

In my gratitude, I overflowed with benignity to all the world, and even granted the poor Frenchman
permission to enjoy his pipe, a privilege of which he made haste to avail himself. It was an
ill-timed charity, to be sure, but I could well afford to submit to the temporary discomfort
in the fulness of my satisfaction.

The driver hastened the horses. With ever-increasing speed we passed the lowly cottages in
the suburbs, where people were getting up and preparing breakfast by candle light, and at last
the 'three grays' cantered triumphantly to the ---- Hotel--in time for breakfast, too!

There was not a moment to spare, however, and so, without waiting even to make my toilet, we
hurried to the train.

The relief I experienced when fairly seated in the car, the excitement of finding myself in
the world once more, among bustling, wide-awake people, stimulated me, and for some time I
was unconscious of my fatigue.

The Englishman was to leave me at a station a few miles beyond Bangor, as his journey lay in
a different direction. We exchanged cards, and I could not help saying, as we parted:

'I met you a stranger, but I have found in you a friend and a brother.'[A]

The Scotchman continued on to Boston with me.

His chivalrous and thoughtful consideration remained undiminished.

At last, after many intervals of lassitude and reanimation, I broke down altogether. My strength
left me. Over-powered with grief and fatigue, I was glad to rest my weary head on my old plaid
cloak, which the Scotchman rolled into a pillow for me in the saloon of the car, where I lay
for the last six hours until we reached Boston.

Kind friends were there to meet me, and the Scotchman gave me into their charge, a poor, exhausted
creature.

But I was in time--and that was enough.

FOOTNOTES:

[A] The accomplished author of 'Intuitive Morals,' in an article in Fraser's Magazine, entitled
'A Day at the Dead Sea,' takes occasion to render a high tribute to the courtesy of our countrymen.
She writes:

     'If at any time I needed to find a gentleman who should aid me
     in any little difficulties of travel, or show me a kindness,
     with that consideration for a woman, as a woman, which is the
     true tone of manly courtesy, then I should desire to find a
     North American gentleman.... They are simply the most kind and
     courteous of any people.'

It is with heartfelt pleasure that I return this compliment, in this account of my winter journey,
which, but for the constant and delicate kindness of her countrymen, would have proved wellnigh
insupportable.

DIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;

OR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.

January 3d.

Yesterday, amid the drinking of toasts, the peals of joyous music, and the volleys of musketry
from our dragoons in honor of the investiture of the Duke of Courland, the chamberlain despatched
to Warsaw returned, with letters announcing that the ceremony had been delayed, on account
of the king's illness: it has been postponed until the eighth of January. Our little Matthias
says it is a bad omen, and that as the ducal crown eludes his grasp, so will a royal one. I
felt quite uneasy,... but then there came several visitors, and they distracted my thoughts.
After dinner came Madame Dembinska, wife of the king's cupbearer, with her sons and daughters;
the pantler Jordan, with his wife and son, and M. Swidinski, Palatine of Braclaw, with his
nephew, the Abbé Vincent. The latter gentleman has been several times at Maleszow; he is a
very pious man; my parents love and esteem him very much. Although he is quite young, we kiss
his hands as a minister of God. Barbara has completely won his good opinion; he has given her
a rosary, and the 'Christian's Daily Manual.' He was seated next to her at supper, and even
addressed his conversation to her twice. This is not at all astonishing, for Barbara is so
good; besides, she is the eldest, and hence entitled to more politeness than the rest of us.

Friday, January 5th.

The palatine and his nephew are still with us, and we are daily expecting other guests. The
eldest of the palatine's sons is Starost of Radom, and the younger is a colonel in the king's
army. The palatine, who has been a widower several years, has also two daughters, one married
to Granowski, Palatine of Rawa, and the other recently wedded to Lauckorouski, Castellan of
Polaniec. I am very curious to see the palatine's sons; they were educated at Luneville, in
France; they must have an air and manner different from those of our young Poles.

The good King Stanislaus, though he dwells in a foreign land, is always seeking to be useful
to his compatriots; several young Polish gentlemen are maintained and educated by him at Luneville.
They receive the best instruction, and the sons of our first families strive for the honor,
using the pretext of relationship, however distant, to obtain their desires. Indeed, they are
quite right, for when one can say of a young man, He has studied at Luneville, and has been
to Paris, he has certainly an excellent foundation for the beginning of his career. Every one
feels quite sure that his manners will be irreproachable, that he can speak French, and dance
the minuet and quadrilles. All the gentlemen who have been in France are very successful in
society, and very pleasing to ladies.... Really, I am exceedingly curious to see the palatine's
two sons!

Saturday, January 6th.

They finally arrived yesterday afternoon, and do not in the least correspond to the idea I
had formed of them, the starost less than his brother. I thought I should see a young, lively,
and agreeable man, in short, a young man like Prince Cherry, in Madame de Beaumont's tales,
who would speak French all the time; but I was quite mistaken. The starost is no longer young;
he is thirty years old, and quite stout; he is not fond of dancing, and never speaks a single
word of French. Every now and then he puts in a word or two of Latin, like my father. I am
much better pleased with the colonel; he wears a uniform, is young, and says at least a few
words in French.

To-day is Twelfth day, and Michael Chronowski will be emancipated before nightfall. They are
baking a great cake in the kitchen, with a bean in it. Who will be king? Heavens, if I were
to be queen! I should wear a crown on my head during the whole evening, and should bear absolute
sway in the castle.... There would be plenty of dancing then, I'll answer for it!... But whether
I command it or not, there must be dancing, I am sure, for a crowd of visitors has been pouring
in ever since morning; the servants are grumbling, and the keeper of the table service is quite
provoked. When he sees all the carriages standing on the square facing the church of Piotrkowicé,
he says there is no end to work for him. As for me, I jump with joy; and so it is in this world,
where some are happy from the very cause which makes the torment of others.

Sunday, January 7th.

How many people! The castle is so gay and lively! We amused ourselves finely. I was not queen,
for Barbara got the bean, and when she saw it in her portion of the cake, she blushed to her
very eyes. Madame, who was seated near her, announced the fact, and all the guests and attendants
testified their satisfaction by loud shouts. Our little Matthias laughed and said: She who
has the bean will marry Mr. Michael (kto dostal migdala dostanie Michala) a Polish proverb
always repeated upon such occasions. It is also a common saying that when a young girl has
it, she will be married before the end of the carnival. God grant that this prophecy may be
verified, for then we shall have a wedding, and abundance of dancing!

I cannot become accustomed to the starost; his gravity does not please me; he would dance nothing
yesterday but Polish dances. He never mentions Paris or Luneville, and takes no notice of young
people; he never addresses to us any of those little gallantries which are the small change
of good society; he talks only to our parents, plays cards, and reads the newspapers. I still
continue to think that his brother is worth more than he; at least he is more sociable, he
talks about Paris and Luneville, and is not so old.

But I am forgetting to relate the ceremonies accompanying Michael Chronowski's emancipation;
I was quite diverted with them. When all the company had assembled in the great hall, my father
took his place upon the highest seat; the folding doors were thrown open, and the steward,
accompanied by several young courtiers, introduced the candidate for emancipation, very richly
dressed in a full suit of new clothes. He knelt before my father, who touched his cheek lightly
in sign of good will; he then fastened a sword at the young man's side, drank off a cup of
wine, and presented him with a fine horse, accompanied by a groom, also well mounted and equipped.
The two horses were in the castle court.

My father asked Chronowski if he preferred trying his fortune in the world or remaining in
his service. Michael replied, timidly, that he was very happy in the castle, but would like
to see more of his country, and ventured to ask a recommendation to Prince Lubomirski, Palatine
of Lublin, my father's brother-in-law. His request was granted, my father slipped a roll of
twenty gold ducats into his hand, and invited him to remain with us during the carnival. Chronowski
seemed delighted with this proposition, and after paying his homage to my father and mother,
he kissed the hands of all the ladies present; from that moment he was admitted into our society,
and danced his best in Mazurkas and Cracroviennes with Barbara. He certainly dances very well,
and my sister is equally graceful; it was charming to see them!

Monday, January 8th.

The prophecy has been really fulfilled! Barbara is to be married at the termination of the
carnival, and she is to marry Mr. Michael, for such is the name of the Starost Swidzinski.
He asked Barbara's hand of my mother yesterday, and to-morrow they will be betrothed! Poor
Barbara was all in tears when she came to tell us the great news; she shrinks from the idea
of marriage, and it will be very painful to her to leave her parents and her home. But it would
have been very unadvisable to have refused the match, when my father and mother assure her
that she will be very happy. The starost seems to me a very pious, gentle, and upright man;
his family is noble, ancient, and wealthy. What more is necessary?

The three brothers Swidzinski, Alexander, Michael, and Anthony, died as brave men should, near
Chocim, under the command of the celebrated Chodkiewicz. This renown is a glory for those who
still live. The starost's parents have already conferred upon him the entire ownership of the
castle of Sulgostow. He holds, besides, a considerable starosty under the king's appointment,
and expects soon to be a castellan. The Palatine Swidzinski and the Abbé Vincent have come
to speed on the marriage; they desire it exceedingly. The palatine is charmed with Barbara,
and I am sure he will love her dearly when he knows her better. The wedding will take place
at the castle of Maleszow on the 25th of February. What fine balls and concerts we shall have!
We will dance until we can scarcely stand. Barbara will be: Your ladyship the starostine. I
shall be very sorry when I can no longer call her Barbara, dear Barbara.

I really feel quite remorseful at having described the starost so ill in my journal; however,
I do not think I have said anything very offensive. I hope Barbara may be happy, and I think
she will be, for she has always told me she did not like very young people; the starost is
reasonable, and in my mother's opinion such men make the best husbands. If my mother says so,
it must be true; but for my part, I much prefer gay and agreeable young men. One is certainly
entitled to one's own individual taste.

I have not forgotten that this is the day selected for the investiture of the prince royal
with the dukedom of Courland. The king's health is reëstablished. Colonel Swidzinski speaks
in the highest terms of Prince Charles, whom he knows very well; but the palatine and his eldest
son do not wish him to succeed his father; they say that the crown should be placed upon the
head of a compatriot.

Wednesday, January 10th.

The betrothal took place yesterday. Dinner was served at the usual hour. When Barbara entered
the saloon my mother gave her a ball of silk to untwist; she was red as fire, and her eyes
were fixed on the ground. The starost did not leave her a moment. Our little Matthias laughed
with his malicious air, and gave vent to a thousand pleasantries, which diverted every one
exceedingly; all laughed aloud, and although I did not understand the meaning of his jests,
I laughed more than any one else. After dinner, Barbara seated herself in the recess by the
window; the starost approached her, and said, aloud:

'Is it indeed true, mademoiselle, that you will oppose no obstacles to my happiness?'

Barbara replied, in a low and trembling voice:

'My parents' will has always been for me a sacred duty.'

Here the conversation ended.

When the chamberlains, attendants, and servants had retired, the palatine, followed by the
Abbé Vincent, conducted the starost to my parents, who were seated on a sofa. The palatine
addressed my father in the following words:

     'My heart is penetrated with the sincerest affection and most
     profound esteem for the illustrious house of the Corvini
     Krasinski; I have always ardently desired that the modest arms
     of Polkozie might be united with the glorious and illustrious
     arms of Slepowron. My happiness is at its height on beholding
     that your highnesses will deign to grant me this great honor.
     Your daughter Barbara is a model of virtue and grace; my son
     Michael is the glory and consolation of my life; deign, then,
     to consent to the union of this young couple; deign to confirm
     your promise on this very day. Behold the ring which I received
     from my parents: I placed it upon the hand of my betrothed, who
     is, alas! now no more, but who will live eternally in my heart.
     Permit, then, that during a similar ceremony my son may offer
     it to your daughter, as a token of his affection and
     unalterable attachment.'

As he said these words, he placed the ring upon a silver dish held by the Abbé Vincent. The
abbé also made a discourse, but he put so much Latin into it that I could not understand it.

My father replied to the two speeches in the following terms:

     'I am most happy to confirm the promise I have made to you; I
     consent to the marriage of my daughter with the starost; I give
     her my blessing, and surrender to your honorable son all the
     rights I possess over her.'

     'I unite in the desires and intentions of my husband,' added my
     mother. 'I give this ring to my daughter; it is the most
     precious jewel of our house. My father, Stephen Humiecki,
     received it from the hand of Augustus II, when he had
     fortunately succeeded in concluding the peace of Carlowitz, by
     which the Turks restored the fortress of Kamieniec-Podolski to
     the Poles. With this ring, which recalls so many dear
     remembrances, was I myself betrothed; I give it to my eldest
     daughter, with my blessing, and the hope that she may be as
     happy as I have been since my marriage.'

Thus saying, she placed on the dish a ring set with superb diamonds, enclosing a miniature
of Augustus II.

'Barbara, come to me,' said my father; but the poor child was so confused, so agitated and
trembling, that she could scarcely walk; I cannot understand how she moved even those few paces.
At last, however, she placed herself at my father's side, and the Abbé Vincent gave them his
benediction in Latin. One of the rings was given to the starost, and the other to my sister;
her betrothed placed it upon the little finger of her left hand, called the heart finger (serdeczny).
He then kissed Barbara's hand, and she in her turn presented her ring; but she was so much
overcome that she found great difficulty in encircling the end of his finger with the glittering
hoop. The starost again kissed her hand, after which he threw himself at my parents' feet,
and swore to watch over the happiness of their beloved daughter.

The palatine kissed Barbara on the forehead, while the colonel and the abbé made her a thousand
compliments, each more beautiful than the last. My father filled a great goblet with old Hungarian
wine; he toasted the new couple, and all who were present drank by turns out of the same cup.

All this passed so solemnly and tenderly that I wept unrestrainedly.

'Do not weep, little Frances,' said Matthias, who was present at this scene; 'a year hence
it will be your turn.'

A year would be too soon; but if it were in two years, I would not be sorry.

The whole Swidzinski family are so kind and attentive to Barbara! and my parents for the first
time kissed her face when she bade them good night. Since yesterday, every one in the castle
treats her with the greatest respect; all congratulate her, and she is overwhelmed with homage
and compliments. Each one would like to be employed in her establishment; my father has given
1,000 Holland ducats to my mother, recommending her to do all for her daughter that she may
think necessary. They consulted a long time over the trousseau that should be given to her.
To-morrow Miss Zawistowska will go to Warsaw with the commissary, to make purchases. This Miss
Zawistowska is a very respectable person; she is about thirty, and has lived in the castle
ever since she was a child. There are in the storeroom four large chests filled with silver,
destined for our use. My father had Barbara's brought to him and examined it carefully; this
chest will be sent to Warsaw, that the silver may be cleaned.

The palatine and the starost leave us to-morrow. They go to Sulgostow, where they will make
all the preparations necessary for Barbara's reception.

My father has had the customary letters written to announce the marriage, and will send them
by the chamberlains to the various parts of Poland. The most distinguished among our chamberlains,
and an equerry richly equipped, will depart in two days to carry letters to the king, the princes
his sons, the primate, and the principal senators. My father announces the marriage, and begs
them to give it their benediction; if he does not exactly invite them, he gives them to understand
that he would feel highly honored by their presence. Ah! if one of the princes were to come--the
Duke of Courland, for example--what a lustre it would throw upon the wedding! But they will
merely send their representatives, as is usual upon such occasions.

The castle is in a state of constant activity; great preparations are making for the approaching
festivities. The starost has displayed an unexampled generosity; he has made us all the most
beautiful presents. He has given me a turquoise pin; Sophia has received a ruby cross; Mary,
a Venetian chain, and even my parents have condescended to accept gifts from him. My father
has a silver-gilt goblet, admirably chased; and my mother, a beautiful box made of mother-of-pearl
mounted in gold. Even madame has not been forgotten, for she found a blonde mantle on her bed
this morning; she praises the generosity of the Polish lords to the skies. But this is the
only virtue she concedes to our nation, so that I cannot love madame; her injustice toward
my countrymen repels me. We had yesterday a grand state supper; the orchestra played unceasingly,
toasts were drunk in honor of the happy couple, and the dragoons fired numberless volleys of
musketry; their captain gave them as their watchword for the day, 'Michael and Barbara.'

Barbara begins to take courage; she only blushes now when she looks at her ring; she hides
it as much as she can; but it is of no use, for every one sees it, and the brilliants sparkle
like stars.

This morning all the court went hunting, in accordance with the old custom, which renders this
action of good omen to the wedded pair. Formerly before they set out, the betrothed was obliged
to display her ankle to the hunters. God be praised that this custom no longer exists, for
I am sure Barbara would have died of shame. But our little Matthias insisted upon the performance
of this ceremony, saying that if it were omitted the chase would certainly be unfortunate.
For once his prophecy failed; they killed a wild boar, two bucks, an elk, and many hares. The
starost killed the wild boar with his own hand, and laid it at Barbara's feet.

My father had all the horses brought out of his stables for the hunters to ride upon. Among
them was one of exceeding beauty, but so unmanageable that the best groom had never yet been
able to mount him. The starost was confident he could control him, and, notwithstanding the
terror of the spectators, he leaped on his back and guided him three times round the castle
of Maleszow. It was truly a noble sight. Barbara was very pale; she trembled for her betrothed;
but when she saw him so firmly seated on the fiery animal, the bright color returned to her
cheek. From that moment I felt reconciled to the starost. In truth, he is not so bad; he looks
well on horseback, and possesses that dauntless courage so dear to the heart of a woman. I
must then forgive his ignorance of the minuet and quadrilles. My father gave the starost the
horse he had so well merited, completely caparisoned, and with a groom to take care of him.

Sunday, January 20th.

I have neglected my journal during the past week; we have been so busy with the preparations
for the marriage; there are such crowds of people at the castle; every one is occupied doing
the honors; both mornings and afternoons are passed in company. Our studies are laid aside--the
chronology, the French grammar, and even Madame de Beaumont lie quiet and undisturbed in their
places. We are busily engaged with our needles, because each one of us desires to make a present
to Barbara. I am embroidering a morning dress, which will be charming; I even steal some hours
from my sleep that I may the sooner finish it. Mary is embroidering a straw-colored muslin,
with shaded silks mingled with gold thread, and Sophia is making a lovely toilet cover.

My mother is entirely occupied with the trousseau; she opens her wardrobes and chests, bringing
out linen, cloth, furs, curtains, and tapestry. I help her as well as I can; she is sometimes
good enough to ask my opinion; she is so scrupulous, so much afraid of not dividing our shares
equally. She is so particular, that she even sends for the chaplain to judge of the exactness
of the division. The tailors and lace-makers who have come from Warsaw to make up the trousseau
will hardly be able to finish their work during the next month. The linen is all ready. The
young ladies belonging to our suite have aided materially. They have been sewing at linen during
the past two years, and now they are marking it with blue cotton. These poor girls will soon
be very expert in making the letters B and K. The trousseau will be magnificent.

Barbara cannot conceive what she will ever be able to do with so many dresses! Until now none
of us have ever had more than four at a time: two brown woollen ones, with black aprons, for
every-day wear, a white one for Sundays, and a more elegant one for grand occasions, ceremonials,
etc. We always found them quite enough, but my mother says that her ladyship the starostine
will need an entirely different toilette from that required by Miss Barbara; that what was
proper for a young girl will not be sufficient for a married woman.

I spoke of a ball of silk given to Barbara by my mother on the day of the betrothal; well,
that was to make a purse for the starost. Barbara works at her purse from morning till night:
the tangled silk was given her as a trial of her care and patience; for she must first wind
the skeins without breaking them or dimming their lustre. She has succeeded admirably. Barbara
may marry without doubt or fear; our little Matthias answers for her vocation.

The chamberlains and the equerry have departed with their letters of announcement. Barbara
is terrified at the thought that the princes and lords of the court may perhaps come from Warsaw.
What a child she is! As for me, I should be delighted! But I just remember--the investiture
of the prince royal took place on the eighth of this month. The evening before the ceremony,
our cousin, Prince Lubomirska, Palatine of Lublin and the prince royal's marshal, gave a magnificent
ball. The dinners, balls, and concerts are said to have lasted more than a week. The new Duke
of Courland made a speech in Polish, which produced an excellent effect. He is now regarded
as an independent prince, and has shown both dignity and greatness of mind throughout this
whole affair.

The Polish Courier gave all the details of the ceremony. If I had had time I should have copied
them, they interested me so deeply! But all these details are nothing to what I should have
seen with my own eyes had I been there. What is description compared with one's own observation?
I am really very glad of the final investiture of the prince; it is the only public matter
which pleases and consoles me; all else seems to be in a most lamentable condition. While I
am so diligently working at Barbara's morning dress I am forced to hear things which sadden
me deeply. The chaplain reads the papers aloud to us, and I see that the republic loses daily
in power and dignity; the neighboring powers invade it under divers pretexts; their troops
pillage and devastate the country, while the Government refuses to interfere.... I dare not
think of the future, but my father says we must enjoy the present. All speak in subdued tones
of the woes which threaten Poland, and then dance and drink; the joyous festivals and banquets
would deceive one into thinking the times must be prosperous. The Poles, perhaps, act like
our little Matthias; when he is vexed he never lets the glass leave his hands, repeating always:
He who pines, needs good wines (dobry trunek na frasunek); the sadder he is, the more he drinks.

Friday, January 25th, 1759.

The starost arrived yesterday, and Barbara found on her table this morning two beautiful silver
baskets filled with oranges and bonbons; she distributed them among us (her sisters) and the
young ladies of the court; even the waiting women received their share. Our work is progressing;
my morning dress is nearly finished.

My mother gives Barbara a bedstead with all its furniture. We have long had our flocks of geese
and swans. There is a poor creature in the castle who can do nothing but pick down; poor Marina
is so stupid that she is incapable of comprehending anything more difficult, and passes her
whole life in this occupation. Each of us has her share of the down; Barbara will have two
large feather beds, eight large pillows of goose down, and two small ones of swans' down. The
pillows are made of stuff spun in the castle, and are to be covered with crimson damask, besides
which they will have an upper case of Holland cambric, trimmed with lace. The young ladies
of our suite have put a great deal of work upon them.

Saturday, February 2d.

The starost remained a week at the castle, and left us yesterday. When he again returns, it
will be to carry Barbara away with him. I cannot imagine her going off alone with a stranger,
it is truly inconceivable; I must see it with my own eyes before I can believe it.

Barbara seems to feel daily more and more esteem and friendship toward the starost. He, however,
rarely addresses her; all his conversation is directed to our parents--his cares and attentions
are exclusively for them. I am told that this is the proper way for a well-bred man to make
his court, and that he should win the heart of his betrothed by pleasing her family.

In three weeks the wedding will take place. My sisters and I have each a new dress, presented
to us by Barbara; she has given a dress to all the young girls in the castle.

Nearly all the persons invited to the wedding have accepted; but the king and the princes,
to my great regret, will merely send their representatives.

I doubt whether the palatiness, Princess Lubomirska, can come; she will find difficulty in
leaving Warsaw at the present time. She approves highly of Barbara's marriage, and has written
her a charming letter of congratulation; my father is delighted.

My morning dress will be finished in time; but then I have worked unceasingly, that is, as
much as I could; for my mother is constantly calling upon me; she is so kind to me, and condescends
to make use of my services in all her preparations. Until now, Barbara alone was consulted
and had confidence placed in her, as being the eldest; this happiness was her right, but my
good parents desire that I should now take her place. I have already been twice intrusted with
the key of the little room where the cordials and sweet-meats are kept; that gives me importance.
I have consequently assumed a graver air; every one must see that I have grown a year older.
I will try to imitate Barbara, so that when the starost takes her away my parents may not feel
her loss too deeply. I have plenty of good will, but shall I be able to satisfy them?

Tuesday, February 12th.

It seems that the splendor and magnificence displayed at the investiture had never before been
equalled. The Warsaw gazettes are never weary of dilating upon this subject.

The guests begin to arrive; people are pouring in from the most distant quarters. Notwithstanding
the number and size of the apartments, it will be impossible to lodge all in the castle; preparations
have been made in the village, in the priest's house, and even in the better class of huts
belonging to the peasants, to receive some of our guests.

The cooks and confectioners are all busy; the laundry is in a state of unceasing activity;
the trousseau is nearly finished; and the bedsteads, two cases filled with mattresses, pillows,
and carpets, a box of silver, and a thousand other things, were sent off to Sulgostow this
morning. The bedsteads are of iron and beautifully wrought; the curtains are of blue damask,
and fastened to the four corners by bunches of ostrich plumes.

Barbara ought to kiss both the feet and the hands of our parents, who have given her so many
precious things. My father has inscribed an exact list of the trousseau in a large book, preceded
by the words which I here copy, lest I should forget them:

     'List of the trousseau which I, Stanislaus, of the Corvini
     Krasinski, etc., etc., and my wife Angelica Humiecka, give to
     our dear and well beloved daughter Barbara, on the occasion of
     her marriage with His Excellency, Michael Swidinski, Starost of
     Radom. We implore the blessing of Heaven upon our dear child,
     and we bless her with parental affection in the name of the
     Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.'

I do not copy the list of the trousseau, for I have no time; I shall, besides, be one day obliged
to do it upon my own account.

Wednesday, February 20th.

Well! time flies, and the wedding will take place in five days. The starost arrived yesterday
evening. Barbara trembled like a leaf in an autumn wind when he was announced by the chamberlain.
We expect to-day the palatine, the colonel, the Abbé Vincent, and the Palatine Granowski, with
the palatiness, the starost's sister. Madame Lanckoronska, the starost's second sister, cannot
come to Maleszow; she is in Podolia with her husband. Barbara is really sorry, for she is very
anxious to know her, every one speaks so highly of her. My sister is about entering into a
good family; all the persons composing it are pious and honorable; they show her the most unbounded
attention, and pay her homage as if she were a queen.

The trousseau is entirely finished; all that could not be sent to Sulgostow has been deposited
in chests, of which Miss Zawistowska keeps the keys. Barbara is very well pleased that she
is to take Miss Zawistowska with her; she has been accustomed to see her ever since she was
a child, and, when far away from her mother, will be very happy to have near her a careful
person whom she can trust, and with whom such dear remembrances are linked.

She will also be accompanied by several of our suite. She will have two chamberlains, two young
girls (her god-daughters) who embroider beautifully, a waiting woman, and a young lady companion.
The latter is of an excellent family, and is endowed with infinite wit and good sense; her
name is Louisa Linowska: she has lived in the castle several years, and Barbara is passionately
fond of her. There are several other young girls desirous of entering the service of the future
lady starostine; if my parents would consent, she would soon have a dozen at least. When I
marry, I will take a still larger number into my service; I have already promised three of
our young girls that I will take them with me. One is the daughter of Hyacinth, keeper of the
table furniture. The poor man made me a profound bow, and his brows unbent for the first time
in his life.

Sunday, February 24th.

To-morrow will be Barbara's wedding day. What a crowd there will be! The minister Borch, the
king's representative, has arrived, as also Kochanowski, son of the Duke of Courland's castellan,
and the duke's favorite. Kochanowski is a very accomplished young man; one may truly say: As
the master, so the man (iaki pan taki kram).

The invitations were issued for yesterday evening, and every one has been exact in coming.
The arrival of the guests was magnificent; everything had been prepared for their reception;
expresses announced their coming, and our dragoons, all ranged in battle array, presented arms
to each lord as he appeared. The cannon were discharged, and the musketry kept up a rolling
fire, while at intervals were heard joyous peals of music. I never witnessed any scene so beautiful,
so animated, and imposing as that of the reception. One may well believe that the most especial
honors had been reserved for the king's representative. My father awaited him with uncovered
head upon the drawbridge, and before he reached the castle he was obliged to pass through a
double file of courtiers, guests, and attendants. He received profound salutations from right
and from left, and the hurrahs seemed never ending.

The contract of marriage was signed to-day amid a large concourse of persons, and in presence
of the appointed witnesses. I do not understand the forms of the document, but I do know that
the young bride's presents are superb and in the best taste. The starost has given her three
strings of Oriental pearls and a pair of diamond earrings with drops. The palatine's gifts
are a diamond cross, an aigrette, and a diadem; the colonel, always amiable and gallant, has
presented her with a charming watch and chain from Paris. The Abbé Vincent's gifts are worthy
of himself, consisting of certain precious relics. She is indeed overwhelmed with kindness.

Barbara has never worn any jewelry; until now, her only ornament has been a little ring bearing
an image of the Blessed Virgin; she will certainly not lay that aside, notwithstanding all
her pretty new things.

But I must stop writing, for here comes my morning dress, all nicely bleached and ironed. The
embroidery makes an excellent effect; I must put the last stitches into the dress and then
carry it to Miss Zawistowska, that she may offer it to Barbara to-morrow when she dresses;
how lovely she will look in the pretty white morning dress!

THE SLEEPING PERI.

LINES SUGGESTED BY PALMER'S STATUE.

    Lo! upon the stone reposing,
    Dewy sleep her eyelids closing,
        Rests the Fay;
    Wearily hath the exile wandered,
    Sadly o'er her sorrow pondered,
        All the day.

    Flinty pathways, lone and dreary,
    Quite unmeet for foot of Peri,
        Soft and fair;--
    Heavy air with vapors laden,
    Shrinking, fragile wings from Aidenn
        May not dare;--

    Such the gifts our planet proffers,
    Such the thorny home she offers
        Spirits fine:
    Artists, poets, earthward sent us,
    Heavenly natures, briefly lent us,
        Droop like thine!

    Happy if, amid their dreaming,
    They can feel the glories streaming
        From above;--
    See the light, and hear the flowing,
    Gushing anthems--melting, glowing
        Strains of love!

    Happy Peri! faintly smiling;
    Quivering lip, the sense beguiling,
        Dimpled cheek,
    Form ethereal, heavenly moulded,
    Shadowing eyelids, soft wings folded
        Rest to seek,--

    All betray thee, young immortal,
    Eden's child, without its portal
        Doomed to roam!
    Yet thy spirit sees the glory,
    Hears entranced the rapturous story
        Of thy home.

    Who, O Fay, would dare to wake thee,
    From ecstatic visions take thee
        But to weep?
    Softly dreaming, waking never
    Till thy dreams are truths forever,
        Sweetly sleep!

MY LOST DARLING.

The boom of cannon in the distance, flags floating gaily in the bright morning air, strains
of martial music filling it, a waving of caps and handkerchiefs, shouts in the streets below,
and the tramp of many feet. A regiment is passing! To a stern fate, that beckons darkly in
the distance, these patriots are moving, with firm, determined tread--to long, exhausting marches,
and fireless bivouac; to hunger and cold; to sufferings in varied forms; to wounds and imprisonment;
to death! God knows when and how they are going;--and, amid the doomed throng slowly passing,
the bright face of my darling smilingly upturned to mine. I wave my hand and kiss it; my handkerchief
is wet through and through.

He came to me but an hour since, decked in his uniform (a lamb decked for the slaughter). 'I'm
a lieutenant now,' he said, tapping his shoulder gaily; 'I shall rival Sam Patch at a leap,
and jump to the head at once. Three months is enough to make a colonel of me.' And so, with
his young heart beating high and warm, upborne by wild hopes like these, he held me to his
heart at parting, and went away quite joyously, my poor darling! shedding only a few tears
in sympathy with mine. I watch his form until I lose it in the mass before me; then I watch
the mass moving slowly, slowly on, bearing him away from me; till the heavy tramp dies out
upon the air, and the dark mass, growing less and less, becomes a dim speck in the distance;
and the music wanes, and wanes, and dies out also, and in the still air about me only the voice
of the wind is heard: coming and going at long, lazy intervals, it speaks to my inner sense
with a warning note, a low requiem sound. Why is it that it takes that weird tone always when
sorrow is darkly waiting for me in the future? What prophet's voice speaks to me in it? What
invisible thing without addresses its wild warning to the invisible within? As I listened,
my soul grew chill and dark with the shadow of a coming gloom; my heart grew cold. God help
me! How wildly, how almost despairingly I prayed for my darling's life!

Alone in the world, we were all in all to each other. Mine was a wild, exclusive love. Heart
and soul were bound up in him. Other girls had their lovers; my fond heart beat for him alone.
What tie nearer and dearer than the tie of blood united us? What bond, sacred and invisible,
bound our souls together? I know not; I only know that my heart and mind echoed always the
thoughts and moods of his; that, no matter what dreary distance lay between us, our souls held
communication still; that I rejoiced when he was glad; and wept when I said, 'He is sorrowful
to-day.' He had gone away gay and hopeful, and had left me weeping--oppressed by vague fears
and chill forebodings, my heart could not echo now the happy mood of his. Wild and weird, all
that dreary day, the wind moaned its warning; and the sad echo sounded through other dreary
days that followed this; and dreary nights came also, when I prayed and wept, and covered the
pictured face with tears and kisses--when I cried, 'God keep my precious one, and bring my
darling back to me;' and that was all my prayer;--when I sank to fitful slumbers, and wildly
dreamed of shell and cannon ball, and bullets thick as hail, of foes met in deadly fray, of
shielding my darling's form with mine--there, where all was smoke and darkness and blood and
horror--and dying gladly in his stead. Or the scene changed from horror to desolation, and,
with a dreadful sense of isolation on me, alone in the darkness I wandered up and down, blindly
searching for him I never found; or finding him, perhaps, covered with ghastly wounds, and
dead, quite dead; and then starting broad awake with horror at the sight.

God help us! us women, with our wild, inordinate affections, when Death waits in ambush for
our darlings, whom we are powerless to save from the smallest of life's ills and perils! A
letter came at last, eight dear pages, with all the margins filled. Long, confidential, loving,
with just a thought of sadness in it; a slight, almost imperceptible shadow resting on the
glowing hopes with which he left; yet bright withal, bright like himself. The charm of novelty
was potent yet. How I read it o'er and o'er, this first dear message from him; how I kissed
the senseless thing; how my tears fell upon it; how day and night I wore it on my heart, until
another took its place!

They came at stated intervals now, and as the time wore on, and their tone changed, little
by little, I knew that the hard life he led began to tell upon him--that, petted, fondled,
cherished as he had been, unfitted for hardship of any kind, they grew at times almost too
great for calm endurance. He never complained, my grand, brave boy; he spoke of them lightly
always, sometimes jestingly, but he could not deceive that fine interior sense. I knew there
were times when he turned heartsick from the wild life that claimed him; I could see how his
noble nature shrank from all that was coarse and revolting in it; how he longed for fireside
joys and sweet domestic peace, and pined with dreary homesickness; how his heart cried out
for me in the melancholy night. And then even this comfort, that had softened the dull, longing
pain within, was denied me--no letters came. Mail after mail went and came, and I grew feverish
with suspense. I imagined him beset by ghastly perils, and, with torturing uncertainty wearing
my very life away, I watched and waited as women are wont to do. Then dark rumors were afloat
of foes making a desperate advance, and of bloody battle pending. One night a horror fell upon
my troubled sleep--an appalling gloom, a shuddering, suffocating sense of some impending doom.
Battling fiercely and blindly with this dread, invisible something, I awoke in deadly fright,
to find the terror no less clear to my perceptions, no less palpable and real, and to wrestle
with it still. Some blind instinct in me called aloud for air; with difficulty mastering an
almost overpowering impulse to rush out into the night, I flew to the window, raised it, and
looked out. A fierce storm was raging--a storm of whose very existence I had until that moment
been unconscious. The thunder rolled, and muttered, and broke in wild, fearful crashes. Sheets
of lightning every instant lighted up the blackness, and made the sky terrific. Gushes of wind
and rain wet and chilled me through and through. Unmindful of it, with that fine interior sense
aroused, I listened with all my soul--not to the thunder's fearful voice, to the wild beating
of the storm, or to the wind's melancholy moaning, but to something on the tempestuous air,
and yet a stranger to it.

There came a lull in the storm at last, and then, O God! O God! through the sullen gloom, his
voice was calling to me. Now faint and low, as if his life was ebbing; then raised in agony,
wild with supplication and sharp with pain. I saw him covered with gaping wounds, on a hideous
field, piled with slain and soaked with blood. I went mad, I think: I have a vague remembrance
of rushing out into that fearful storm, undressed as I was, with wild resolve to follow the
sound of the voice, to reach him somehow, or die in the mad attempt; of being brought back,
shut up in my room, and a sort of guard placed over me; of making wild attempts to rush out
again, and struggling ineffectually with those that held me back--of raving wildly; then of
long and dreamless slumbers, when I had become exhausted, and the sharp agony was past; of
rousing myself to go about in a listless, apathetic way, waiting with dulled sense for lists
of killed and wounded; of the doctor bringing the paper to me and saying, with his face all
light: 'He is not dead; you will find his name among the wounded;' of finding where he was,
eluding their vigilance, and travelling night and day until I reached the place. All this seems
vague and unreal, as a half-forgotten dream--too dim and lifeless for memory. Entire change
of scene, new sights and faces, and, more than all, the conviction that the time had come for
action now, and that he would need me, roused me from this misty state a little. When I landed
at the place, I think I recovered the clear consciousness of my surroundings, while standing
in the provost-marshal's office (the city was under military rule) waiting my turn to speak.

Then I thought for the first time what a mad thing it was in me to have come at all--at least,
to have come in the way I had come; I, so unpractical, so wofully lacking in that sterling
common sense, that potent weapon with which women battled successfully with the stern realities
of life; and thinking, too, with a dull pain at my heart, that doubtless my darling would suffer
by reason of my ignorance and inability. I studied the mass of strange faces about me, thinking
to which I would turn for help, if help were needed. After reading them, one after another,
and rejecting them, I turned at last to a group in front of me, and singled out one that was
addressing the others, a man of consequence among them--at least a certain superiority of air
and manner led to that conjecture. He had a fine open face, whose expression changed continually;
and the more I studied the face, the more I placed a blind trust and reliance in it. Attracted
by the magnetism of a fixed gaze, probably, his eyes wandered from the group about him, after
a little while, wandered aimlessly about the room, and then met mine. Seeing that I was watching
him, or observing, perhaps, that I was suffering, though, Heaven knows, the sight of misery
of all kinds there was common enough, he crossed the room and came to me. 'You may be obliged
to wait some time longer yet,' he said, in a tone of hearty kindness; 'you look ill, madam.
You had better sit down.' He found a chair and brought it to me. He was on the point of leaving,
but I grasped his arm as he turned to go. 'If you have any influence here,' I said, in a half-distracted
way, 'tell the clerk, tell somebody to let my turn come next. My brother is here and wounded;
I have travelled night and day to get to him; it's dreadful to be so near, and yet to wait
and wait.' He turned in grave surprise, and looked at me narrowly, fancying, from my incoherency,
I was taking leave of my senses possibly. 'Your name, young lady?' he said, at last. I gave
it, 'Margaret Dunn.' He started at the name, and a heavy shadow came over his face: 'And your
brother,' he said, hurriedly, 'is Lieutenant Dunn, of the Fifty-fifth Illinois Volunteers,
Company A? I am surgeon of the Fifty-fifth; I know him well. He was a brave fellow, and as
fine, manly, and handsome a fellow as one need wish to see.' He ended with a sigh, and mingling
with the shadow there came a look of pity in his face. The past tense, which I am sure he used
unconsciously; the look of pity; the sigh but half suppressed, overpowered me with dread. 'He
has not died of his wounds?' I gasped, grasping his arm convulsively, 'O God! he is not dead?'
'He is alive,' said the doctor, gravely. 'Father, I thank Thee, Thou hast heard my prayer!'

The sudden transition from that mortal dread of death to the blessed certainty of life was
too much; my joy was too great; forgetful of my surroundings, unmindful of his presence, I
wept and sobbed aloud. When I had controlled my emotion in a measure, or at least their stormy
outward manifestation, I found the doctor regarding me with the same grave face. 'You should
not have come here in your present weak, excited state,' he said, at last, 'or, rather, you
should not have come at all. From sights and sounds of a hospital, even strong men turn with
a shudder. It's no place for a delicate woman.' 'He is there,' I murmured, tremulously; 'I
can suffer anything for those I love.' Regarding me in silence for a moment, he looked as if
taking my measure. 'These women that can bear,' he said, with a sigh, 'sometimes overrate their
powers of endurance.' 'Do you think I shall have to wait much longer? do you think I can go
soon now?' I questioned, appealingly, breaking the silence that had fallen between us. 'No,
you must wait your turn,' said the doctor, decidedly; 'besides, you are not calm enough yet;
the surgeons are at work in the ward where we are going. They are taking off a man's limb--two
or three of them, for that matter. I shan't take you there until the operations are finished.'
Then first came the horrid thought that he might be mutilated in the same way. Vague, indistinct,
dreadful visions uprose before me, of all sorts and kinds of horrid disfigurement, and I grew
sick and faint. 'Not his limb!' I gasped, struggling with a deathly faintness. 'No, not his,'
said the doctor, sorrowfully. The same cloud was still there that had settled on his face when
he first spoke of him; the same pity for me shining through it. 'There is a room here where
the ladies go when they have long to wait. You had better go in there and rest yourself. I
will bring you some tea and something light and palatable in the shape of food, and you must
eat and drink. Confiscated property, you see,' he said, as he entered; 'a rebel family walked
out, and we walked in; comfortable quarters.' I noticed then there was a carpet on the floor,
sofa, mirrors, and other comforts. 'Sit down,' said the doctor. He had taken the tone of command
with me--a tone I would have resented at any other time; now, nerveless and weak, relying on
him solely, I obeyed him like a sick child. He brought the tea, watched me while I drank it,
looked on while I choked down tears and food together. He ordered me to go to sleep, and left
me. Doubtless even this command had its effect. Things grew dreamy and indistinct after a while;
perhaps I slept a little; but the time seemed very, very long. At last his tap at the door
roused me from this half-conscious state. 'Ready?' he briefly questioned, as he looked in,
a moment after. I said yes, tremulously: now that the time had come, I trembled so I could
scarcely keep my feet. He gave me his arm as we went out together. 'It's not far,' he said,
encouragingly, 'just across here.' The fresh air did me good. Quite likely, the conversation
he perseveringly maintained on indifferent subjects, in spite of my random replies, was also
of service to me. I grew calmer as we went along. The distance was but short, and we soon reached
the place of our destination--a large hotel, which had been hurriedly converted into a hospital.

'Come,' said the doctor, pausing with his hand upon the door, and turning to me, 'cheer up!
There is no misery, after all, but what is in the comparative degree. Things are never so bad
but that they may have been worse. I dare say, on occasion you can be a brave little woman.'

'I can,' I returned, eagerly, too grateful for his penetration, or at least his good opinion,
and too sad and abstracted altogether, to notice that he was paying me a compliment. 'I can,
indeed; indeed, you haven't seen the best part of me.'

He smiled just the ghost of a smile in answer, as we went in. He led me through several rooms
into what had been a large dining hall--a chill, bare, desolate place. Cots were ranged up
and down the room, cots across it, cots filled up the centre, and all, all filled with sick
and wounded men. I thought if I was once in the room with my brother, some instinct would lead
me to him; but I felt no drawing toward any one of those miserable bedsides, and a chill of
disappointment fell upon me. 'Take me to the ward where my brother is lying,' I said to the
doctor, pleadingly, 'ah, pray do!' 'This is the ward,' he replied, but he did not take me to
him. He stopped at every cot we passed. Of my burning impatience, which he could not choose
but see, of the urgent and almost passionate appeals I made to hasten his progress, he took
no notice whatever. He stopped almost every moment; he felt the pulse of one patient, questioned
another, dealt out medicine here and there--took his own time for everything. We stopped at
last where, on the outside of the coverlet, lay a wounded soldier, half dressed; a poor, mutilated
creature; a leg and an arm were gone. The face was turned toward the wall, away from us; not
a muscle moved; he was sleeping, probably. 'Take me to my brother,' I piteously moaned, shuddering
with horror as I turned from the unaccustomed sight. 'I have waited so long; do take me to
my brother.' 'This is somebody's brother!' said the doctor, sharply. Something in the tone,
not the sharpness of it--something half familiar in the broken outline of the form, caused
a half-suffocating sense of a vague, unutterable horror. A deathly faintness seized me; I sank
into a chair beside the bed. The doctor gave me water to drink--hastily and silently sprinkled
some water upon my head and face. There was a movement of the poor maimed form upon the bed--he
gave me a warning look--the face turned toward us. It was my darling's! 'My life!' Shivering
and shuddering I threw myself upon the narrow bed beside him, clasped my poor darling in my
arms, and held his stricken heart to mine. The hard, defiant look upon his features melted
into one of tenderness--down the worn face the tears fell slowly. 'I didn't know as you would
love me just the same,' he said. It was his right arm that was gone. Calling him by every endearing
name with wild expressions of affection, I wiped the tears tenderly away, covering the dear
face with kisses, while my own fell fast. The doctor left us together for a little--albeit
used to scenes like this, wiping his eyes as he went away.

A gust of bitter passion swept over my darling. He started up. 'Rascally rebels!' he cried;
'cursed bullets! Why couldn't they have been aimed at my heart, and killed me! I was willing
to give my life--but to make a wreck, a broken hull of me! Look at me, Maggie, a poor, maimed
wretch. What am I fit for? Who will care for me now? To be an object of loathing!' he continued,
between his set teeth; 'to be a sight of horror; to win, perhaps, after she gets used to the
deformity, a little meagre love for charity's sake; to be scorned, and loathed, and pitied;
if I could get only off from the face of the earth--out of the sight of men; if God would let
me die!' Wounded sorely as he was, his boyish vanity in his really handsome person, his manly
pride in its strength, was more sorely wounded still. Yes, strangers would think him a sight
to behold: had not even I turned shuddering from that disfigured form, before I knew it was
my darling's? He was ruined for life, and he was young too--only nineteen. He was very weak,
and this passionate outbreak of feeling had exhausted him. It was but a flash of his old fire
at best. His head sank back upon my arm again; he lay with his eyes closed, resting for a little;
when he spoke again, his voice was low and wavering, tremulous with tears.

'I wouldn't care so much, only----' He paused, hesitated, drew with difficulty a little locket
from his bosom, and gazed upon it tearfully. A jealous pain shot through my heart. I had thought
until that moment that I was all in all to him, first in his affections, as he was in mine;
that no rival shared his heart. This was the bitterest pang of all. I looked down at the beautiful
face set in the locket, perfect as to form and color, with such a fierce hatred of its original
as I hope in God's name I shall never feel again for any mortal breathing.

'It's all over between us,' he sighed; 'even if I were ungenerous enough to ask it, she wouldn't
receive me now.' My face spoke my scorn. 'Don't blame her,' he said, pathetically; 'it isn't
natural she should, poor little thing! This for what she might have been to me.' Then, he kissed
the pictured face, and sorrowfully laid it back again upon his heart. 'I thought to go back
to her a colonel at least--a general, perhaps,' he went on, with a piteous smile; 'to be crowned
with laurels, loaded with honors and proudly claim her as my bride: I little thought that this
would be the end!' It was a man's grave comment on a boy's wild dream. He had buried his youth
in those two weeks of anguish. It was a man's face that looked upon me, and I read in it a
man's strong endurance and stern resolve. That, and the smile with which he said it, moved
me more than any emotion, however hopeless or despairing, could have done. My grief burst forth
anew.

Dearer, a thousand times dearer, now that love had left him, and youthful friends turned coldly
away. Ah! thank God! bless God! There are none so dear to each other, so inexpressibly dear,
as those whom sorrow joins; no tie that binds so closely as the sacred bond of suffering. I
said so brokenly, sobbing out my love and sorrow, as I held him to my heart. His longing for
home had been intense; now that he had seen me, it became wellnigh insupportable. To go away
from this his place of suffering--from the myriad eyes bent upon him here, and creep back broken-hearted
to that sacred sheltering haven, and hide his great grief there--this wish absorbed him quite.
'I want to go home, Maggie,' he said, in a broken-hearted whisper, clinging to me the while;
'I want to go home and die.' Die! I wouldn't hear the word; I stopped its half-formed utterance
with tears and kisses. The doctor shook his head at the suggestion and counselled delay; but
he was burning with impatience, and I was resolute. We started the very next day. We travelled
by easy stages, but he grew weaker all the time: toward the last, with his head upon my breast,
he would sleep for hours, peacefully as a little child. Reduced to almost infant weakness when
we reached our journey's end, they took him in their arms tenderly as they would have taken
an infant, and laid him on my bed. There, in that darkened room, I nursed him night and day,
striving to win him back to thoughts of life, and love of it. 'It's too late, Maggie,' he would
say, with placid resignation; 'life has nothing for me, dear; I want to go to sleep--to that
long, dreamless sleep, where memory never wakes to haunt us!' But I couldn't bear it--I wouldn't
have it so. I bade him think of how my heart would break if he, too, died and left me! In my
earnest love, I called Heaven to witness that I was ready not only to die for him, if need
be, but to do a better, nobler thing, God helping me--to live for him; eschewing other ties,
to devote my life and heart to this one affection. We had wealth, thank God! (I never thanked
God for that before.) We would go to far-off lands as soon as he was able--away from old sights
and scenes, where no familiar object would recall the past, and where, cut off from all association,
we could be all and all to each other; and, with ardent hope, I commenced immediate preparations
for our voyage. I read him books of travel; showed him the half-finished garments intended
for our journey; purchased all things needful, even to the books we would read upon the way--richly
paid for toilsome endeavor, for days of patient waiting, if I but roused in him even a passing
interest in the subject, won from him but the shadow of a smile. Ah! even those days had their
gleams of sunshine. I was his only nurse, his sole dependence, his all; there was exquisite
happiness in that! I said to myself, he is mine now, and always will be; and then I thought
of the fair face so lovingly resting against the weary heart, and grew exultant, Heaven forgive
me! and said, 'Nothing will take him from me now.' One day he rallied very suddenly. A portion
of his old vigor seemed to animate his frame; something of the old look was in his face. He
took my hand and laid it tenderly against his cheek; he smiled twice during the morning; I
kissed him and said, 'We shall be able to start soon now, my darling!' The doctor gravely watched
us both, but I would not let his gravity disturb me. He called me to him as he left the room.
As I went out, the dear brown eyes were watching me. I turned to nod and smile to him, saying
blithely, as I joined the doctor, 'Don't you think we shall be able to start in three weeks,
doctor?' 'Shut the door, my dear,' he said; I had left it ajar. The tone startled me. There
was compassion in it; and I noticed now that he was walking up and down the room in an agitated
way. 'My dear,' he said again, 'you had better take a seat farther from the door.' His voice
was hoarse this time--his tone, his air, his unwonted tenderness, were ominous. 'What is the
matter?' I said, in sudden fear; 'can't we go as soon as we have intended?'

He did not answer me at first; he walked to the window and looked out; he turned to me again
after a little:

'He is bound on a longer voyage,' he said, with a tremor in his voice; 'he is going to a more
distant country.'

I did not start or cry; I did not comprehend the meaning of his words. I sat silent, looking
at him. He came to me, took both my hands in his: 'Hush!' he said; 'don't cry aloud--it would
disturb him. But I must tell you the truth: he won't live three days.' I understood it all
now--took in the full meaning of his dreadful words. I did not cry or faint; I did not even
weep; I thought my heart was bleeding--that the blood was actually oozing from it drop by drop.
I clung to the doctor as I would to the strong arm of an earthly saviour with wild entreaty,
with passionate appeal. I prayed him to save my darling, as if he held within his grasp the
keys of life and death. I offered all my wealth; I made unheard-of vows--promised impossible
things. In the anguish of my supplication, I fell at his very feet. 'My dear,' he said, as
he raised me tenderly up again, 'even in this world there is a limit to wealth's potent power;
it is always powerless in a time like this.' I had sunk into a chair, exhausted by emotion,
and chill with dread, my face buried in my hands despairingly. He laid his hand upon my head
in fatherly compassion: 'It's what we've all got to come to, sooner or later,' he went on,
tremulously. 'As life goes on, our hopes die out one by one; and, one after another, death
claims our treasures. Bow to what is inevitable; pray for resignation.'

I couldn't--I wouldn't. I prayed for his life, yet in a hopeless, despairing way. To the All-powerful
my soul went out continually in one wild, desperate cry. I battled fiercely with that stern
impending fate, yet I felt from the first how vainly. Around my poor, wounded, dying boy, night
and day I hovered constantly--I would not leave him for an instant. Every hour was bearing
him away from me--drifting him farther and farther out into an unknown sea. I crept to his
side when I could do nothing more for him, and laid my head beside his on the pillow. Sometimes
I slept there for very sorrow, grasping him instinctively the while, seeking even in sleep,
with fierce, rebellious will, to stem the invisible tide of that dark river, and bear him back
to life. 'He would not live three days,' the doctor had said: he did live just three days.
It was on the evening of the third, just as the day was fading, that he called me softly to
him. I had opened the window and put back the curtain, to admit the air and the waning light.

The wind rose as the twilight deepened, waking at intervals in the gloomy stillness, as if
from sleep. It filled the room every now and then with a sad, sighing sound, then died out
slowly, again to swell, again to fall, sad as the tolling of a funeral knell. He lay listening
to it when I went to him, with parted lips and strange solemnity of face. Too heart-broken
for speech, I knelt beside him with a stifled moan. 'Magsie,' (that was his pet name for me,)
'I thought it was your notion, dear, but there is a voice in the wind to-night, and it is calling
me.' I made an effort to answer him, to speak; to tell him at the last how precious he had
always been to me--how inexpressibly dear; to win from him some parting word of fond endearment
that I might remember always; but the words died out in hoarse, inarticulate murmurs. 'Yes,
a voice is calling to me, and it falls through miles and miles of air; then the wind takes
it up and brings it to me. They want me up there, and I am going, Magsie; kiss me, dear.' The
one arm stole around my neck; the chilled lips met mine in a lingering farewell pressure. He
went on, feebly: 'I have been wild and wayward, Magsie, in the times gone by; I have grieved
your great love sometimes, by giving you a cross word or look, not meaning it, dear, never
meaning it, but because a perverse mood seized me. Forgive me, dear; don't remember it against
me, sister!' Words came at last; they burst forth in a low moan of anguish: 'My darling! my
darling! you break my heart!' Then my poor boy crept closer to me, in a last fond effort at
endearment, and laid his cold cheek close against my own. The gloom deepened. The form within
my clasp grew cold, became a lifeless weight. I knew it, but I could not lay it down. I still
chafed the pulseless hand, and kissed it, and still I pressed the poor, maimed, lifeless form
closer and closer to my heart, till reason fled, and I remember nothing. They unwound the chilled
arm from about my neck; they thought I, too, was dead.... With muffled drumbeat and martial
music, with horrid pomp of war, they buried my darling as soldiers are buried that die at home;
but on the grave over which was fired the parting volley there fell no kindred's tear: I, the
only mourner, lay raving in my room.

Wintry winds have piled the dreary snow above that grave; spring has kissed it into bloom and
verdure; summer skies have smiled above it; and the maimed form they laid there has melted
into nothing now! Time has softened the despair of my grief--the worst bitterness is past.

Through the gloomy portals of that dark gate of suffering, an unseen Hand has led me out into
a broader and a higher life; and the heart that held darling only, purged from its selfishness
by the fierce fire of affliction, beats now for all humanity. Hearts whose love and gratitude
God has given me the power to win, say, out of the fulness of their love for me, that a ministering
angel is among them in woman's guise; that no hand is half so lavish in its gifts, no heart
so full of sympathy, no watcher's form so constant beside the couch of pain. The sick follow
me with murmured prayer and blessing; and wounded soldiers turn to kiss my shadow as I pass.
Yet ever as the twilight falls I steal away to listen to the night wind's moaning, and ever
in the gloom I feel an unseen presence--an arm about my neck--a cheek laid close to mine. Journeying
on the lonely, rugged path of duty, 'following meekly where His footsteps lead,' I work and
wait, and patiently abide my time--content if, when the welcome summons come, when life's day
is fading, I may feel my darling's face pressed close to my own. He may not come to me, but
I shall go to him, where he may wear his glorified body forever!

REASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM.

CHAPTER IV.--UNITY.

The Divine Attributes, the base of all true Art.

Having already shown that the aspirations of man, made in the image of his God, are always
directed toward that wondrous background from which all life projects--the Infinite, we now
propose to make a few remarks upon the manifestation of some of the remaining attributes revealed
to him, and which he is forever striving to incarnate in the works of art.

Beauty, in its proper expression, must be allied to or suggest the Infinite, for in it alone
can ceaseless variety be united with absolute unity. Unity is an essential characteristic of
life itself; variety resolving itself into unity, and unity expanding itself into variety,
mark all that God has made. As a necessary consequence of the position we have assumed, viz.:
'That art is not a servile copy, but rather a creation of man in the Spirit of Nature,' Variety
and Unity must characterize every great work of art, as they mark every work of the Creator.
Let us take any of the humblest things which He has made, a flower, for example: Unity, Order,
Proportion, and Symmetry are in all its fragile leaves--the Great Over-Soul seems to have lingered
lovingly over the elaboration of its idea, and stamped upon its fragrant leaves, perishing
and trivial as they may seem, the secrets of Infinity! With what variety it is marked! How
many shades in the gradations of the color! What infinitesimal changes in the direction of
the gentle curvature of the rounded lines! what richness in the details! what subtle and penetrating
tenderness in the perfume! Love, Infinity, Unity, Order, Proportion, Symmetry, mark all the
Divine Works: Unity, Order, Proportion, Symmetry, Love, as manifested in the careful rendering
of the subject in hand, with the suggestion of that mystic Infinite in which all being is cradled,
and from which all art is nurtured, should, on their lower level in their finite degree, mark
every work of art. But to our subject: the divine attribute of unity, and its manifestation
in and through the finite.

All things, except God, receive externally some perfection from other things. We will not now
consider the unity of His mystical Trinity, but rather dwell upon the necessity of His inherence
in all things, without which no creature could retain existence for a moment. We speak of His
comprehensive unity because it is an object of hope to men; it is that of which Christ thought
when he said: 'Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me
through their word: that they may be all One, as Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee.' There
is no matter, no spirit, that is not capable of unity of some kind with other creatures, in
which unity is found their several perfections, and which is a source of joy for all who see
it. Who has not felt the strength of united love? In the sudden emotion common to humanity
which we all experience at the sight of suffering, and which brought tears from the Holy One
on the death of Lazarus, in the strange shivering which we feel pervade our souls at the shrill
cry of anguish, do we not recognize more than a simple resemblance of nature--do we not feel
that the race is really One, that a common grief again unites it, that in this oneness we are
all justly partakers in the sin of Adam, that in this oneness we may partake of the glory of
the Brother who died to unite the finite with the Infinite?

It is to this essential unity of the race that the dramatist owes much of his power; for let
him but strike the common strings of grief and love, and the crowd at once show by their words,
their gestures, their looks, and often by their tears, their earnest sympathy. Even at the
spectacle of an imaginary grief their hearts are moved, the sorrow thrills through every soul;
if the poet has been true to nature, they feel that his imaginary characters are but part and
parcel of themselves in their woe. Thus the emotion excited by dramatic representations has
its source in the very root of our being, the unity of our common nature, in our common brotherhood;
consequently, neither in the instincts of the body nor the caprices of the poetic fancy. If
the poet would not break the bond, let him respect the unities of nature, whatever view he
may take of those of convention. It is to this wonderful unity with our common nature that
the greatest of all uninspired writers, Shakspeare, owes his universal acknowledgment, his
unequalled power.

If, as we have labored to teach, matter always symbolizes mind, we should expect to find it
also pervaded with the unity pertaining to its lower rank, and so indeed we find it. In its
noblest form the unity of matter is that organization of it which builds it into living temples
for the indwelling spirits, those houses not made with hands--the bodies of noble men, of fair
and loving women. It is the walking and clinging together that gives power to the winds, weight
to the waves, heat to the sunbeams, and stability to the mountains. It is the 'clinging together'
which throws our syllables into words, gives metre to poetry, and melody and harmony to sound.
Indeed, the clinging together of sounds, as seized by the ear in time, with the ever forming
and living ebb and flow of widely different rhythms, exerting the most mysterious influences
upon the soul, is not less remarkable than its more familiar history in space.

Manifold, indeed, would be the generalizations of the different species of unity, for it is
the secret link of all being.

In creatures capable of will, there would be the unity of acts controlled, in all their apparent
variety, by its directing power; and the unity of emotions in the masses, when swayed by some
common impulse. As we rise in the order of being the number of similar members becomes less;
their structure appearing based on the principle of two things united by a third;--a constant
type even in matter of the Triune Existence.

Out of the necessity of unity arises that of variety, a necessity vividly felt, because it
lies at the surface of things, and is assisted by our love of change and the power of contrast.
It were a mistake to suppose that mere variety, without a linking principle of unity, is, necessarily,
either agreeable or beautiful. Variety is never so conspicuous as when united with some intimation
of unity.

Now, of that which is thus necessary to the perfection of things, all types and suggestions
must be beautiful in whatever way they may suggest or manifest it. Let the artist look to it,
that our pictures may gain expression; our music cease to weary us through the unceasing dissimilarity
of its parts, highly adorned arabesques running into each other, graceful, but without significance,
without any perceptible principle of unity in the jarring 'motifs;' and our poems have some
certain theme, that their highly wrought details may not confuse and bewilder the spirit always
in search of some central unity. Like the burning sands which, clinging not together in any
sweet union of fellowship, blind and confuse us with their drifting masses, are all such essays
in art; for an idea capable of quickening an artistic creation must be vitally One, and every
great work, notwithstanding its variety and the manifold complexity of its parts, must form
a Whole.

The association of ideas, upon which is based the unity of the continuous life of the individual,
with the pervading sense of personal identity, has been aptly called the 'cohesion of the moral
world.' It is not less powerful, less irresistible, than that of the physical world. The association
of ideas is a constituent and necessary phase of the unity of our mental and moral being, the
indispensable condition of all development, whether of mind or soul. Without the power of association,
the intellect would strive in vain to construct consecutive trains of thought; it would indeed
be condemned to eternal infancy, because, as it ascertained new relations, those already acquired
would escape, and a labor constantly renewed would be requisite to regain them. Without association
of ideas, no voluntary virtue would be possible; and at the end of long years of effort and
self-restraint, we would have gained no additional control over the course of our impetuous
passions.

The fact that much of the difference in intellectual capacity so strongly characterizing different
individuals arises from their various powers over the flow and logical association of ideas,
has scarcely elicited the attention it so well deserves. It is of immense importance in the
history of mental development. If an individual connects his ideas with difficulty, or can
continue to chain them in rational sequence only with the most laborious efforts, he will have
either a dull and heavy, or flighty and illogical, mind.

If another has great trouble in modifying or arranging the association of ideas which arise
spontaneously in the soul, he will suffer himself to be ruled by them, in place of exercising
rational domination over them; he will pursue every chimera; he will trust every impulse; he
will but dream, even when he tries to think; and will be of a weak and fickle, but obstinate
and self-opinionated, intellect. His whole exhaustive logic will consist in clothing in exact
and reiterated assertions the heterogeneous order in which ideas are arbitrarily, accidentally,
and spontaneously associated in his own imagination.

Another will associate his ideas in logical sequence, yet with startling rapidity; in a manner
and through subtle relations quite unknown to common men, incapable of such vivid, rational,
and consequential combinations; and will, in consequence, be a man of clear and vivid intellect.

The wonderful faculty of improvisation so often seen in Italy, is an example of the power of
appropriate and rapid association. There is no doubt that this power is susceptible of development
and cultivation, and that much that is brilliant in intuition is lost through the want of it.
In spite of this, no system has as yet been devised for its culture. Let him who would labor
for the real improvement of humanity think of it, write for it, and aid us in its development:
as the law of internal unity with regard to the immense range of possible associations is so
vital to our moral well being, so essential to our intellectual sanity, let our deepest thinkers
devote themselves to its culture in the race!

We may distinctly trace the intuitive strivings of the human spirit for unity even in the theology
of nations without revelation. In one of the ancient fragments of Greek poetry known as Orphic
Hymns, we find them thus articulated:

     'Jupiter is the First and Last; Jupiter is man and immortal
     Virgin; Jupiter is the base of Earth and Heaven; Jupiter is the
     living breath of all beings; Jupiter is the source of Fire; the
     root of the Sea; Jupiter is the Sun and Moon; Jupiter is King
     of the universe; He created all things; He is a Living Force; a
     God; the Heart of all that is;--a supernal Body which embraces
     all bodies, fire, water, earth, air, night, day, with Metis the
     first Generatrix, and Love, full of magic. All that is, is
     contained in the immense Body of Jupiter.'

The reader will not fail to observe how much this Greek hymn resembles in its spirit the extract
we have already given him from the Vedas; how closely it coincides with the transcendental
philosophy of the Hindoos.

But the idea of God, vague and indeterminate apart from revelation, soon lost its pantheistic
unity in the wildest polytheistic variety. The primitive idea of unity, passing through the
distorting prism of the fallen and corrupt human imagination, was divided, decomposed, clothed
in a thousand colors and forms to allure and satisfy the senses. Thus there was no part of
nature without its appropriate god, invested with supreme power over the class of being subjected
to its care. No one had ever seen any one of these gods, but the people had no doubt of their
existence. Names in close accordance with their separate functions were given them; these names
became symbols destined to represent the different active principles of the physical world.

Thus in their literary and sacred language they substituted the names of
Jupiter, Hyades, Hamadryads, Apollo, for those of Air, Fountains,
Forests, and Sun. Nature almost disappeared under this traditionary
language, which, giving play to the lighter fancy, chilled the
imagination, and singularly limited the view. Indeed, it so amused and
allured the fancy by its diversity that the mind scarcely cared to rise
from this fantastic and grotesque world to seek the sublime principles
of Infinity, of Unity. If the ancients had regarded nature as a vast
system of signs designed to manifest the ideas of the Great Artist; if
they had at all understood the marvellous Unity of the Divine Works, it
would have been worse than idle in them to have invented a language
which thus lowered nature, robbing it of its solemn majesty, its august
dignity. As all these divinities had the human figure, God was banished
from His own universe, man everywhere substituting his own personality.
Speaking of the great dearth of vivid descriptions of natural scenery
among the ancients, Chateaubriand says: 'It must not be supposed that
men as full of sensibility as the ancients wanted eyes to see nature, or
talent to depict it, if some powerful cause had not blinded and misled
them; this cause was their mythology, which, peopling the universe with
graceful phantoms, robbed creation of its solemnity, of its sublime
repose. Christianity came--and fauns, satyrs, and wanton nymphs
disappeared; the grottos regained their holy silence; the dim woods
their mystic reveries; the vast forests their vague and sublime
melancholy; the streams overturned their petty urns to drink only from
the mountain tops, to pour forth only the waters of the abyss.
    Look up, poets, to the Sun!
                     Pan, Pan is dead.

    'Christ hath sent us down the angels;
       And the whole earth and the skies
     Are illumed by altar candles
       Lit for blessed mysteries;
     And a Priest's hand through creation
     Waveth calm and consecration--
                     And Pan is dead.

    'O brave Poets, keep back nothing;
       Mix not falsehood with the whole!
     Look up Godward! speak the truth in
       Worthy song from earnest soul!
                     Pan, Pan is dead.'

As we have already intimated, Pantheism is the negation of the Divine Personality in order
to arrive at Unity; Polytheism is the negation of the Divine Unity, which is fractioned and
divided that its multitudinous action may be conceived. The light fancy was delighted with
such divisions, resulting in varied gods and goddesses; but the soul could find no satisfaction
for its deeper needs in such conceptions; urged on by its secret instincts, it sought to recompose
the broken unity of the divine nature.

All government requires a Head; and when an attempt was made to apply the heterogeneous qualities
and contradictory powers of the gods to the regulation of society--when it was necessary to
find in an Olympus filled with quarrels and scandals, a steady Power capable of directing the
destinies of a great people toward a single aim--men were again forced to recompose the fractioned
Unity, to form an idea of one God superior to those with whom they had peopled earth and heaven.
They were thus forced upon the conception of a Being superior to Jupiter, who subjected all
the gods to his inflexible laws; and giving wings to those instincts of dread always present
in the soul of a fallen race, they invented an invisible Divinity who never manifested himself
to men; who dwelt in inaccessible and dreadful regions, in which an inscrutable Horror forever
reigned; and through this new Terror, Unity was again brought into the design of creation,
for all beings were, in despite of themselves, forced to fulfil the decrees of its pitiless
will. All struggle was vain, all effort useless, prayer was without avail, and human anguish
utterly unheeded by this terrific phantom of irresistible and crushing Power without a heart!

It is this dread idea which, pervading the pages of Eschylus, gives them that peculiar character
of simplicity and grandeur, with which no other tragedies are marked in a like degree. Such
was the source of the inspiration of classic tragedy, the spring of that stern and severe poetry
which throws the lurid hues of a melancholy so profound upon the pallid and affrighted face
of humanity. Man, struggling with all the gloomy energy of despair against this vague but formidable
Horror, which no virtue or agony could conciliate--this dark Fate, the creation of his own
misled and perverted intuitions--and vainly seeking to escape from the inflexible circle which
he had traced around himself, is an object which cannot fail to awaken the deepest pity. He
asks from his fellow men, from nature, from the gods, the meaning of the dire enigma of life.
Alas! they leave him to struggle in the stony hands of an unbending Fate! no reply is ever
given to his wild demand, and the 'veil of Isis is never raised!' The world quivered under
some strange anathema; a mystic malediction wreathed its thorns round the anguished heads of
men; even in the midst of their festivals, when seeming to drink deep of joy from the brimming
cup of life, the invisible hand of a Gorgon Fate was forever felt tracing upon their walls
the decrees of a dark, inscrutable, inflexible, and terrible destiny!

Yet there are poets among us, who would willingly return to the days of Paganism, and resuscitate
the gods of Greece!

    'Get to dust as common mortals,
      By a common doom and track!
    Let no Schiller from the portals
      Of that Hades call you back,
    Or instruct us all to weep:
    Everlasting be your sleep! With his
profound instincts of the Infinite, his craving for the Absolute, he
seizes madly upon every object which suggests their image to him; the
foul fiend, adapting his temptations to the nature of the tempted, still
whispers, as into the ear of the mother of mankind: 'Ye shall be as
gods;'--but the phenomenal flies before him, and he everywhere falls
upon the thorns closely hedging in the narrow circle of the actual.
Without Faith, the artist is among the most miserable of men, for
through the illimitable horizons of the Infinite, genius catches secrets
which it can never fully utter; symbolic signs, whose sense it cannot
articulate; while the voice of the invisible Love loads every breeze.
What profound and mournful aspirations for that Unknown which the
mortal may not see, surge through the soul of the imaginative!

    'E'en the flowing azure air
    Thou hast charmed for his despair.'

While the artist strives to incorporate with the works which their presence shall render immortal,
suggestions of Infinity, of Unity, let him hopefully turn to the Author of all Beauty for true
inspiration and peace.

As satisfaction and response to the longings of the spirit, the Gospel has brought Life and
Immortality to light. The assurance that 'God is Love' responds to the inmost wish of the soul.
The problem of antiquity, the possible Union of the finite with the Infinite, has been solved
in the most marvellous manner. No longer are we oppressed with the loss of all personal identity,
all moral responsibility, as in pantheism; nor confused by the debasing fractioning of the
Divine Unity, as in polytheism; nor bound hand and foot under the crushing despotism of a pitiless
Fate;--but in the Glorified Humanity of Christ these perplexing problems of the soul are answered,
and the incomprehensible union of the Infinite and finite at last accomplished, He took our
nature upon Him that Infinite Love might pass through all degrees of suffering, even to the
last dying gasp of agony, to release us from the horrors of the 'second death.' Every human
feeling is known to Him, but in infinite purity; the Real and Ideal are in equal perfection.
Far higher, indeed, than the most sublime conception that uninspired thought could ever have
engendered; human, yet far above humanity; ruling all ages; winning all adoration; sublime
in tender simplicity--behold the meek Lamb of God, the Holy Son of the Blessed Virgin!

Oh, eternal, immaculate Beauty! if in this world Thou but sufferest us to divine Thy Perfections;
if Thou hast given us ephemeral delights which always escape our eager grasp at the very moment
we dream of their full enjoyment; if the flower fades so fast--the days of spring are so fleeting;
if nature, like a thick veil thrown between this world and the next, suffers but a few rays
of Thy glory to pierce its folds, while it keeps us from Thee even in kindling the flame of
desires which it never satisfies--it is because Thou knowest that in the inexhaustible richness
of Thy Being there are everlasting fountains to quench the insatiate thirst of the human soul,
when in the bosom of infinite splendor we may contemplate and adore Thee forever and ever!

'That they all may be One, as Thou, Father, in me, and I in Thee: that they also may be one in us.'

Oh, inconceivable and glorious Unity! What wonder that thy types on earth are so full of meaning--so
rich in delight!

THE BUCCANEERS OF AMERICA.

II.

A still more terrible name to the Spaniards, as a leader of the buccaneers, was Francis Lolonois,
a Frenchman, who in his youth was transported as a slave to the Caribbean Islands. Passing
thence to Tortuga, he became a common mariner, and conducted himself so well in several voyages
as to win the confidence of the governor, M. de la Place, who gave him a ship in which to seek
his fortune. The beginning of his career on his own account was favorable; but his cruelties
toward the Spaniards were such as to make his name terrible throughout the Indies; and the
Spanish mariner preferred death in any form to falling into his hands. Fortune, however, being
ever inconstant, Lolonois did not escape reverses. Encountering a tempest on the coast of Campeachy,
his ship was wrecked, and himself and crew cast on shore. Scarcely had he dried his dripping
clothes when he was met by an armed force, and defeated in a severe battle. Being wounded,
and concealing himself among the dead bodies of his companions, he escaped, and arrived at
Campeachy in disguise, in time to take part in the thanksgiving and religious rejoicings of
the Spaniards on account of his supposed death. Here he succeeded in enticing some slaves from
their masters, with whom he again put to sea, with the design of ravaging the small town of
De los Cayes, on the south side of Cuba. Divining his project, however, some fishermen conveyed
information to the governor at Havana, who immediately despatched a vessel of war of ten guns
in pursuit, with orders not to return until the pirates were captured, and every man executed
except Lolonois himself, who was to be brought to Havana. This vessel entered the port of De
los Cayes while the pirates were yet at sea; but they were advised of every particular of the
pursuit, and concerted their measures accordingly.

It was on a clear, starlight night, when the Spaniard lay quietly at anchor in the glassy waters
of the bay,

    'Secure that nought of evil could delight
    To walk in such a scene on such a night,'

that the pirates entered the harbor in two canoes. Stealing upon their intended prey so silently
as to escape observation, they boarded her on both sides at once, and, after a sharp conflict,
succeeded in her capture. Lolonois then informed the prisoners that he knew their orders, and
it was his purpose to execute them upon those who were to have enforced them upon him. Supplications
and entreaties were in vain. He successively struck off the heads of every one with his own
hand--sucking, at each stroke, the drops of blood that trickled from his sabre.

Encouraged by his success, Lolonois forthwith set about organizing a force to make a descent
upon the main, with a view of taking Maracaibo itself. While engaged in these preparations,
he formed a connection with Michael de Basco, who, having retired from the sea, was living
upon his gains. De Basco had served in the wars of Europe as an officer with distinguished
gallantry; and he now engaged with Lolonois as the land commander. When the expedition sailed,
it consisted of eight vessels and six hundred men. On their passage they fell in with a Spanish
armed ship from Porto Rico for New Spain. Lolonois parted from the fleet and insisted on engaging
the Spaniard alone. He did so, and carried the ship after an engagement of three hours. She
mounted sixteen guns, carried a crew of sixty men, and was, moreover, richly laden with specie,
jewels, and merchandise. Shortly after another vessel was taken, when on her voyage to Hispaniola
to pay the troops. This was a valuable capture, the prize being laden with arms and ammunition
as well as specie. The prize vessels were sent into Tortuga, where they were unladen; and one
of them was immediately armed and sent back to join the main squadron as the flagship. Their
marine thus augmented, they sailed first into the Bay of Venerada, the fort guarding the entrance
to which was taken, the guns spiked, and the garrison, numbering two hundred and fifty men,
put to the sword. The pirates next sailed into the Lake of Maracaibo, landed their forces,
and proceeded at once to attack the castle that guarded the entrance to the harbor. The governor
had made judicious dispositions for its defence, having formed an ambuscade for the purpose
of bringing the pirates between two fires. His design, however, in this respect, was frustrated,
for those forming the ambuscade, being discovered and routed, fled to the town, the inhabitants
of which, remembering the former visitation of the pirates, deserted in wild consternation,
and fell back upon Gibraltar, thirty leagues distant. Meantime the pirates, though armed with
swords and pistols only, attacked the castle with such impetuosity as to compel its capitulation.
The slaughter was great. After the surrender the guns were spiked, and the castle demolished.
The next day the invaders advanced upon the town, which they found desolate. It was well stored
with provisions, but all the valuables had been removed or buried. Lolonois demanded information
of the prisoners where the plate, jewels, and money were concealed, and attempts were made
to extort confessions by the rack, but to little purpose. He then hacked one of the prisoners
to pieces with his sword, declaring that such should be the fate of all, unless the hidden
treasures of the town should be forthcoming. But the poor wretches were unable to give the
information, as the owners had fled as best they could, changing their own hiding places, and
taking away their valuables. Having remained fifteen days in Maracaibo, and supposing that
the people had carried their treasures with them to Gibraltar, Lolonois determined to sail
to that town. The deputy governor, however, without the knowledge of the pirates, had made
vigorous preparations for its defence; and accordingly, on their arrival in sight of the town,
they unexpectedly discovered the royal standard floating from two strong batteries guarding
a very narrow channel through which the pirate squadron must pass. A council of war was called,
at which, after a spirited speech from Lolonois, it was agreed to land and carry the works
by storm--the leader declaring that he would pistol any man who should flinch, with his own
hand. The Spanish forces numbered eight hundred men, well appointed; but nothing could daunt
the resolution of the pirates. The Spaniards conducted themselves bravely; and not until five
hundred of their number had fallen did they yield. The buccaneers had eighty killed and wounded,
not one of the latter recovering--an evidence of the desperation with which they fought. The
town of Gibraltar, of course, fell into their hands; but it was a bootless conquest, inasmuch
as during the time the pirates had wasted at Maracaibo, the people had secured their treasure
by carrying it away. To save the town from the torch, however, the inhabitants paid a ransom
of ten thousand pieces of eight, yet not until a portion of it had been burned. After spending
two months on shore, the buccaneers reëmbarked, carrying away all the crosses, pictures, and
bells of the churches, for the purpose, as they alleged, of erecting a chapel in the island
of Tortuga, to which pious object a portion of the spoils was to be consecrated! The amount
of their booty, during their expedition, was two hundred and sixty thousand pieces of eight,
together with vast quantities of plate, jewels, and merchandise--most of which was soon dissipated,
after their return, in debauchery, and other rude pleasures of such a ruffian race.

The next exploit of Lolonois was the capture, in the mouth of the Guatemala river, of a Spanish
ship, carrying forty-two guns, and manned by one hundred and thirty fighting men; the pirate
carrying only twenty-two guns, and being attended by a single small vessel. The Spaniard made
a good defence, and the pirate chief was at first repulsed. Yet afterward, under cover of a
thick mist, rendered more dense by the smoke of the powder, the pirates boarded the Spaniard
from their small craft, and bravely accomplished their purpose.

The career of this desperado was soon to come to an end. Shortly after this last exploit, while
cruising in the Bay of Honduras, his own ship was wrecked, and he, together with his crew,
were thrown upon an island. Their next business was to build a boat from the remains of the
broken ship--a work which occupied them six months, and when finished she would carry but half
their number--the other half remaining behind by lot. Lolonois then directed his course for
Carthagena; but venturing ashore at Darien, he was made prisoner by a wild tribe of Indians,
who became the instruments of divine justice in avenging his many cruelties. Fitting death
for such a horrible monster!

But the career of the most formidable chief in this bloody catalogue remains yet to be described.
It was that of Henry Morgan, whose very name, as it has been justly remarked, 'spread such
terror abroad, that with it the old women frightened their children asleep, and then lay awake
themselves through fear.' Morgan was the son of a wealthy farmer in Wales, but not satisfied
with his secluded condition, he sought a seaport, and sailed for Barbadoes, where he was sold
for a term of years for his passage. The term of his service having expired, he repaired to
Jamaica, where the temptations spread before him by the buccaneers of rapidly arriving at wealth
and fame, induced him to join their community. In the course of several voyages, which were
attended with great success, he evinced so much intrepidity, skill, prudence, and judgment,
as to win the confidence of his companions, several of whom proposed the purchase of a ship
on joint account, the command of which was conferred on him. About this time, also, Morgan
became acquainted with Mausvelt, an old pirate, and who had now on foot an expedition destined
for a descent upon the Spanish main. Mausvelt induced Morgan to join him as his vice-admiral,
and they were shortly at sea with a fleet of fifteen sail, great and small, and five hundred
men, chiefly French and Maroons. Their course was first directed against the two small islands,
nearly contiguous, of St. Catharine's, on the coast of Costa Rica. These, though strongly fortified,
were easily taken, by reason of the inefficiency both of the commander and his troops, superinduced
by the terror inspired by the very name of the pirates. The design of Mausvelt in the acquisition
of these islands, was to fortify and hold them as a place of rendezvous. Leaving, therefore,
a garrison of one hundred men in the forts, Mausvelt and Morgan continued their course to the
main; but as a knowledge of their intentions had preceded them, such preparations had been
made by the Spaniards on the coast for their reception, as induced them to return to St. Catharine's.
Thence they sailed back to Jamaica for recruits; but not being favored by the governor, Mausvelt
repaired to Tortuga, where he died. The command now devolved upon Morgan, who endeavored to
prosecute the designs of his predecessor; but the Spaniards having regained possession of St.
Catharine's, his projects were for a time defeated. Not only had the Spaniards recovered the
island, but a large English ship, despatched thither from Jamaica for the aid of the buccaneers,
and well supplied with arms, men, provisions, and women, also fell into their hands. This was
a severe disappointment to Morgan, who had made extensive arrangements for preserving St. Catharine's
as a storehouse and place of refuge, and had opened a correspondence with Virginia and New
England upon the subject. These events took place in 1665.

But, far from relinquishing the profession he had chosen, Morgan had only just entered upon
it. He soon succeeded in organizing another fleet of nine sail of different-sized vessels,
manned by four hundred and fifty men. With these he made sail for Porto Bello, the third strongest
post at that time in the American dominions of Spain. In order to secure secrecy, Morgan had
communicated his purpose to no living soul, until he came almost in view of the town. Some
of his bold spirits then faltered for a moment; but he had the power to dissipate their doubts
of success, even against odds so great. Landing his forces in the night, Morgan arrived at
the very citadel before he was discovered, having taken captive the sentinel so suddenly as
to prevent the least alarm. The castle was summoned to surrender on pain of putting every man
found therein to death. The summons being disregarded, the assault was begun, and bravely repelled
for a time; but the fortress was at length compelled to yield to the impetuous assaults of
the pirates. But there were yet other castles, and one of the strongest, to be subdued. With
this latter Morgan was hotly engaged from daylight until noon--losing many of his men, and
at times almost despairing himself of success. At length another of the lesser castles gave
way, and Morgan was encouraged and strengthened by the return of the detachment that had been
engaged against it. As a device, moreover, to compel the Spanish governor to yield the principal
castle, the pirate chief caused its walls to be planted round with scaling ladders, upon which,
in front of his own men, the religious prisoners in his hands, priests and nuns, were forced
to ascend. But although these people called to the governor in the name of all their saints
to yield and save their lives, his determination was inflexible. He declared he would yield
only with his life, and that the castle should be defended to the last. Night approached, and
the contest yet raged; but finally, after performing prodigies of valor, the assailants succeeded
in scaling the walls, and the castle was entered sword in hand. The garrison thereupon submitted,
all but the governor, who, deaf to the entreaties of his wife and daughter, fought on, killing
several of the pirates with his own hand, and also some of his own soldiers for surrendering,
until he was himself killed. The entire town was now in possession of the rapacious invaders;
and all the treasures of the churches, having been placed in the castles for safety, of course
fell into the hands of the victors, as also did a vast amount of money and plate.

Amazed that a town so strongly fortified as Porto Bello, and so well garrisoned, should have
been captured by so small a force, the president of Panama sent a message to Morgan, desiring
a pattern of the arms by which he had performed so desperate an exploit. Morgan treated the
messenger with courtesy, and returned to the president a pistol and several bullets, as a slender
pattern of the arms he had used, requesting his Excellency to preserve them carefully for a
twelvemonth, when he promised to come to Panama and bring them away. The president, however,
sent the articles back again, to save the pirate chief the trouble of coming after them. He
also sent him as a gift a gold ring, with a civil request that he would not trouble himself
to come to Panama at the time mentioned, since he would not be likely to fare so well as he
had at Porto Bello. Morgan, after having destroyed the military walls at Porto Bello, reëmbarked
with his numbers greatly diminished by battle, debauchery, and disease, and returned to Jamaica.

The fame of exploits like these caused the name of Morgan to resound throughout Europe; and
large numbers of the English chivalry, men of family and rank, hastened to the New World, either
to mend dilapidated fortunes, or to acquire new ones, and to participate in the unlawful glory
which even the darkness of the deeds by which it was won could not eclipse. These recruits
attached themselves to Morgan, and eagerly accepted commands under him. The bold rover gave
them commissions in the name of the king of England, authorizing them to commit hostilities
against the Spaniards, whom he declared to be the enemies of the British crown. To such an
amazing extent did the buccaneering system increase, that more than four thousand men were
now engaged in it, two thousand of whom were under Morgan, with a fleet of thirty-seven vessels,
divided into squadrons, and appointed with all the formality of an independent sovereignty.
Their place of rendezvous was between Tortuga and St. Domingo, the coast of the latter being
plundered for provisions. A squadron of four sail was also sent to the region of the Rio de
la Hacha upon the same errand, where a large ship was captured, the coast successfully ravaged,
and many prisoners put to death, as in former instances, by the most exquisite tortures.

All things being in readiness, the expedition sailed in December, 1670, the ultimate destination
of which was to pay the promised visit to the governor of Panama--the richest city of Spanish
America. Preliminary, however, to their landing upon the isthmus, a detachment of the fleet
was sent against a fortress at the mouth of the Chagu--which river it was necessary to ascend
before disembarking for Panama. This fortress was built upon a steep rock, against which the
waves of the sea were continually breaking, and was defended by an officer of distinguished
ability and courage, and by a garrison in all respects worthy of such a commander. For a time
the contest was doubtful, but the fates favored the freebooters. The Spanish commander was
slain, and, the fort taking fire, the position fell into the hands of the besiegers. The manner
in which the fire was communicated to the fortress was very remarkable. During the fight, an
arrow from the bow of one of the garrison was lodged in the eye of one of the pirates, standing
near his chief. Extracting the barbed shaft from his head with his own hand, and binding some
cotton around the missile, he set it on fire, and shot it back into the fortress from the barrel
of his gun. The burning arrow fell upon the roof of a house thatched with palm leaves, which
were dry, and a conflagration ensued, which the garrison strove in vain to resist. But for
this untoward occurrence, it was believed that Brodley, the pirate vice-admiral, would have
been repulsed.

Brodley was now joined by the main fleet under Morgan himself; and the vessels, having been
brought to anchor, were left with a sufficient guard, while the commander, with twelve hundred
men, embarked in boats and canoes, and commenced the ascent of the river toward the capital,
the sacking of which was to be the crowning act of his career of outrage and blood. They were
compelled soon to leave their boats; and their march for nine days was one of the severest
operations ever successfully encountered by man. The country was desolate, villages and plantations
being alike deserted, and in the flight of the people nothing had been left behind that could
possibly be converted into food, or in any wise minister to the cupidity of the invaders. The
hardships they underwent in climbing mountains almost inaccessible, and traversing morasses
nearly impassable, while in a state bordering upon starvation, exceed the power of language
to describe. The carcass of an ass found by the way afforded an uncooked tempting meal; and
such cats and dogs as did not flee with their owners, were considered delicious morsels.

On the eighth day a narrow defile was feebly defended by a company of Indians, by whom ten
of the pirates were killed, and fourteen others wounded. On the ninth, having gained the summit
of a lofty mountain, to their infinite delight they came in view of the great Southern ocean,
and saw beneath them the glittering spires of Panama, and the shipping in the harbor. The despondency
which had been brooding over them for several days, was now lighted up by the most extravagant
demonstrations of joy. They leaped, and sang, and threw up their hats, and blew their trumpets,
and beat their arms, as though the prize were already their own without a struggle. Seemingly
refreshed in strength by the sight of the object of their desires, the pirates rushed eagerly
forward, and before nightfall encamped upon the great plain on which stood the city, dispersing
with ease several strong reconnoitring parties who had thrown themselves in their way. The
Spaniards had evidently been preparing for their reception, and they played their artillery
upon the invaders all night, but with little effect; the pirates sleeping on the grass with
great composure, anxious for the arrival of the day which was to reward their sufferings with
untold riches.

The invaders were early on foot on the morning of the tenth day, and in full march for the
city. Arriving upon the summit of a little hill, they were brought to a pause by a force which
they saw advancing to meet them. Their own numbers had been reduced on the march to less than
a thousand effective men; and they now beheld an army consisting of two squadrons of horse,
and four regiments of foot, led by the governor in person, and preceded by a large herd of
wild bulls, the design of which singular description of light troops was to throw the buccaneers
into confusion. Beyond these, in immediate proximity to the city, they discovered the people
of Panama in arms, in yet greater numbers. The action with the advanced army, under the governor,
soon commenced, the wild cattle being of no avail against the pirates, who shot them all down
in a very brief space of time. But the Spaniards, especially the cavalry, fought bravely for
more than two hours. The horse having at length been compelled to yield, the infantry fled,
after a brief resistance. Six hundred Spaniards lay dead upon the field, and the buccaneers
suffered so severely that they were forced to desist from an immediate pursuit, and obtain
some rest. From a prisoner they ascertained that the city was defended by two thousand five
hundred men, with a large number of heavy guns, planted at different points. But the buccaneers,
though sadly diminished in numbers, were determined to finish the work they had begun on the
same day; and taking an oath that they would stand by each other to the last, they again advanced,
and a second fierce and bloody encounter took place at the very gates of the city, which, after
a resistance of three hours, fell into the hands of the buccaneers. Neither party gave or received
quarter, and after the conquest the pirates killed nearly all who fell into their hands, sparing
neither ecclesiastics nor women.

The city was at that time one of remarkable splendor, containing two thousand houses of great
magnificence. The private dwellings were chiefly built of cedar, and embellished with hangings,
paintings, and everything that luxury and taste could supply. But the gorgeous palaces and
solemn temples were doomed to the flames by the order of Morgan himself, although he afterward
endeavored to fix the act of vandalism upon others. They were probably burned in revenge because
found empty, for many of the inhabitants had sought refuge in flight, carrying away such of
their valuables as they could. Still, by the horrible processes of torture, immense discoveries
were made of treasures concealed in the wells and caves, and in the woods. Some valuable freights
were taken from boats in the harbor, which had been left aground at low water; and rich deposits
were frequently discovered in the earth, under the excruciating tortures of the rack.

Morgan lingered at Panama for a considerable period, until, indeed, his men began to murmur
at their protracted inactivity. The cause of this inaction will hardly be divined from the
character thus far developed of this stupendous freebooter; but it was the tender passion!
He had among his prisoners a beautiful Spanish lady, who attracted his particular attention.
She was a native of Spain, and the wife of an opulent merchant, whose business had some time
before called him to Peru. According to the historians of that day, she was still in the bloom
of youth; 'Her cheeks, naturally ruddy, were heightened by a tropical sun into a warmer glow;
and her fine black eyes, dazzling with uncommon lustre, gave animation to the noblest countenance
that ever the hand of nature delineated, or poet's fancy conceived. The interest which her
unhappy situation excited was heightened into admiration by her elevated mien; and her whole
deportment indicated a soul incapable of being degraded from its native rank, by any reverse
of condition, or any depth of misery.' Morgan, rude as he was, and unused to the melting mood,
was nevertheless charmed with her conversation, and the admiration which he felt for her bearing
was ere long changed into yet more tender emotions. He provided a house for her, and assigned
to her service a retinue of domestics. Shortly afterward he attempted to open such a correspondence
with her as might favor his desires, but failing in this, he proceeded to usurp some freedoms,
at which her delicacy revolted. Her rebuke, firm and noble, drove him back abashed; but his
impetuous temper could not well brook disappointment, and in the ardor of his passion he subsequently
attempted to force her into compliance with his brutal desires. But with a virtue as exalted
as that of the Roman matron, who resisted, but in vain, the advances of the son of Tarquin,
and with a yet higher courage, she sprang from his attempted embrace, exclaiming, 'Stop! Thinkest
thou, then, that thou canst ravish mine honor from me, as thou hast wrested from me my fortune
and my liberty? Be assured that I can die and be avenged!' Having said this, she drew from
her bosom a poniard, which she would have plunged into his breast, had he not avoided the blow.
From that moment she became an object not only of his hate, but of his cruelty, until at length
she was ransomed by some of her friends. History has not preserved the name of this lofty specimen
of female purity and honor; but, like that of Lucretia, it deserves the topmost niche in the
temple of virtue.

At length, in the month of February, Morgan took his departure from Panama, having one hundred
and seventy-five beasts of burden laden with silver and gold, jewelry, and other precious things.
He also took with him six hundred prisoners, men, women, and children, for the purpose of extorting
enormous ransoms for them by the way; the cries of the women and children were pitiful to hear;
but the freebooter's heart was steeled against every humane emotion. Returning down the river
Chagre, he destroyed the castle at its entrance, and prepared to reëmbark for Jamaica. Before
going on board, however, a division of the plunder was made, which gave great dissatisfaction.
It seemed unaccountable to his men that so large an apparent amount of booty should yield only
about two hundred pieces of eight per capita, and rumors of foul play were rife. Meantime he
had richly laden his own ship with merchandise; and in the course of the following night, while
his companions were in a deep sleep, he put to sea and escaped to Jamaica, and thence to England.
Such an instance of treachery had never been before known among the buccaneers, and the rage
and resentment that ensued cannot be described. His departure was the signal for the dispersion
of the fleet. The French returned to Tortuga. Some of the English attempted to overtake the
mighty robber and make him disgorge, but were unsuccessful. Others of the crews dispersed with
their vessels to seek their fortunes as best they might. Morgan ultimately returned to England
laden with wealth, and was well received. He afterward became a commander in the naval service
of his country, and obtained the honor of knighthood from William III.

The capture of Panama, however, was the last great land expedition successfully undertaken
by the buccaneers. A few other land expeditions, it is true, were begun by chiefs of lesser
note; but the indifferent success which attended these, induced the freebooters insensibly
to confine their operations more exclusively to the water, and there was no sea left untraversed
by them, from the Atlantic to the Indian ocean. The commerce of almost all nations was annoyed
by them, although their depredations continued more particularly to be directed against the
first objects of their hate, the Spaniards. It is a curious fact, illustrating the corruption
of the Roman Catholic Church at that time, that in one of the Spanish ships captured while
on her way to South America, by an Englishman named White, there were found no less than two
millions of Papal bulls, granting indulgences to the Spaniards of the New World! These were
a royal trade, and had been purchased by the king of Spain for three hundred thousand florins,
prime cost, and by him were designed to be retailed for five millions. Thus, by their capture,
his Catholic Majesty lost the benefit of a fine speculation. Had these indulgences been captured
by Yankees, they would have contrived to barter them away at a profit; or had the captors been
good Catholics, they might have ravaged the whole continent with very quiet consciences, having
the Pope's pardon already in their pockets.[B]

It is a curious fact, not, I believe, very extensively understood, that the great English circumnavigator
Dampier was for a considerable period connected with the buccaneers after the flight of Morgan.
Dampier found himself among them at first by accident, having gone ashore on the Spanish main
in great distress to procure provisions. Falling in with a party of the marauders, he was induced
to join them. He was at the taking of Porto Bello; and afterward crossed the Isthmus of Darien
with Sawkins, Sharp, and others. Sawkins, the commander, was killed in an attack on Puebla
Nova in 1679. Dampier, in his 'Voyages,' gives an interesting account of their subsequent course
along the coasts, and among the islands of the Pacific, which was rather disastrous. A mutiny,
however, occurring among those of the buccaneers engaged in the expedition, Dampier returned
across the Isthmus and came to Virginia in July, 1682, where, after he and his companions had
dissipated all their wealth, they fitted out another piratical expedition for the South seas,
doubling Cape Horn in the spring of 1684. Proceeding northward to Panama, Dampier's party were
joined by large numbers of buccaneers who had just crossed the Isthmus; and obtaining a number
of additional vessels, they prepared to intercept the Plate fleet on its departure from Lima
for Spain. After a few successes, and several disasters, Dampier and his companions sailed
to the Philippine Islands in 1686; and subsequently visited most of the islands in the Pacific,
sometimes rioting in luxury, and at others brought to the verge of starvation. Dampier quitted
the buccaneers at the island of Nicoba, in the spring of 1688. Subsequently, however, he again
joined them, as the commander of a fine vessel; but the treachery of his officers and crew
defeated the objects of the cruise. Returning from this bootless voyage, he was presented to
Queen Anne, and well received. He subsequently made a fourth voyage to the Pacific, during
which he discovered and took from the island of Juan Fernandez the celebrated Alexander Selkirk,
the hero of De Foe's Robinson Crusoe--a story ever delightful and ever new to readers old and
young. The actual experience of Selkirk, as related by Dampier, corresponds more closely with
the narrative, probably, than has generally been supposed.

The last great enterprise of this remarkable race of men was directed against Carthagena in
1697. It was planned in France, from one of the ports of which a squadron of twelve vessels
sailed, under the command of Pointis. It was joined by twelve hundred buccaneers in the West
Indies; and although Carthagena was then the strongest city in the New World, its forts and
castles were carried by storm in rapid succession. The booty thus acquired by Pointis amounted
to one million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, with which he embarked and
made sail. But they had not been long at sea before the buccaneers discovered that their rapacious
commander was meditating how he should deprive them of their share of the plunder. Exasperated
at this treatment, they at first determined to put him to death. This purpose, however, was
diverted by a suggestion to return to Carthagena and demand a heavy ransom to save the city
from destruction, that they might fill their pockets in that way. This project was carried
into execution. Entering the city without resistance, the men were confined in the great church,
and a ransom demanded of more than two hundred and eighteen thousand pounds sterling. A venerable
priest ascended the pulpit, and by his eloquent address persuaded the people to comply with
the demand, by surrendering all their remaining money and jewels. But the amount fell short
of the demand, and the city was sacked a second time. Having amassed all the wealth they could
find, the adventurers once more put to sea. But they did not long enjoy their ill-gotten riches.
Meeting with a fleet of ships belonging to England and Holland, both of which nations were
then in alliance with Spain, an engagement ensued, in which several of the pirates were taken
and sunk, and among them were lost the treasure ships, so that the booty went to the bottom
of the sea. This was the last memorable event in the history of the buccaneers of America,
although a lower order of piracy prevailed, both in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, for many
years afterward.

There had been for the most part a separation between the English and French buccaneers on
the revolution of 1688, which brought William and Mary to the throne of England, and terminated
the friendly relations between that nation and the Gauls. By the peace of Ryswick, moreover,
in 1697, peace was restored between France and Spain, and it then became the interest as well
as the policy of Europe to put an end to the associated existence of the most extraordinary
combination of men who ever trod the earth. History affords no parallel to the buccaneers.
'Without any regular system, without laws, without any degree of subordination, and even without
any fixed revenue, they became the astonishment of the age in which they lived, as they will
be of posterity.' In their actions is to be found a mixture of the most opposite feelings and
principles. They were at once undauntedly brave, and cowardly brutal; full of justice and honor
to each other, and yet a lawless banditti. As an evidence of their feelings of honor, it is
related that on a certain occasion a company of their fraternity--'Brothers of the Coast,'
as they styled themselves--had stipulated, for a certain sum, to escort a Spanish ship richly
laden. One of them ventured to propose to his companions to enrich themselves at once by taking
the ship. Montauban, the commander of the troop, had no sooner heard the proposal, than he
desired to resign his command and be set on shore. 'What!' replied the freebooters, 'would
you then leave us? Is there one among us who approves of the treachery you abhor?' A council
was thereupon called, and it was agreed that the person who had made the proposition should
be thrown upon the first coast they should reach. 'The history of past times,' says a quaint
writer, 'doth not offer, nor will that of future times produce, an example of such an association,
almost as marvellous as the discovery of the New World. Their swords and their daring spirit,
which they exercised with such terrible effect, were the only fortune they possessed in Europe.
In America, being enemies of all mankind, and dreaded by all, perpetually exposed to the most
extreme dangers, and considering every day as their last, their wealth was dissipated in the
same manner in which it was acquired. They gave themselves up to all excesses of debauchery
and profusion, and on returning from their expeditions, the intoxication of their victories
accompanied them in their feasts: they would embrace their mistresses in their bloody arms
and fall asleep for a while, lulled by voluptuous pleasures, from which they were aroused to
proceed to fresh massacres. It was a matter of indifference to them whether they left their
bodies upon the earth or beneath the waters, and they consequently looked upon life and death
with the same composure. Ferocious in mind, misguided in conscience, destitute of connections,
of relatives, of friends, of fellow citizens, of country, of an asylum; without any of those
motives which moderate the ardor of bravery by the value which they attach to existence, they
were ever ready to rush, as without sight, upon the most desperate attempts. Equally incapable
of submitting to indigence or quiet; too proud to employ themselves in common labor; they would
have been the scourge of the Old World, had they not been that of the New.'

In closing this paper, it remains to glance for a moment at the real history of William Kidd,
the buccaneer of the American colonies, whose name, as remarked in the former part of this
article,[C] has for a hundred and fifty years stood at the head of the pirate legends of the
North, but who, in reality, must have been one of the smallest members of the fraternity. I
have not been able to ascertain the place of Kidd's nativity. He was, however, the captain
of a merchant vessel, trading between New York and London, and was celebrated for his nautical
skill and enterprise. The first mention of him, in our authentic criminal history, occurs in
1691, in which year, as we learn from the journals of the New York Assembly, much was allowed
to be due him 'for the many good services done for the province in attending with his vessels.'
But in what capacity, or for what object, he 'attended with his vessels,' does not appear.
It was also declared that he ought to be suitably rewarded. Accordingly, in the same year,
it was ordered by the Assembly 'that the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds be paid to Captain
Kidd, as a suitable acknowledgement for the important benefits which the colony had derived
from his services.' The presumption is, that those services were in some way connected with
the protection of the colonial merchant ships from the attacks of the pirates, who were even
yet hovering along the coasts of the Northern colonies. Indeed, the harbor of New York itself
was no stranger to the pirate vessels, and the commerce between them and the 'people of figure'
in the city was not inconsiderable. It was no secret that the pirates were freely supplied
with provisions by the inhabitants of Long Island. Further yet, it was well known in the year
1695, that the English pirates had fitted out the vessels in the harbor of New York. On the
arrival of the pirate vessels from their cruises, their goods were openly sold in the city,
and the conduct of the Colonial Government was such, that collusion, if not actual partnerships
between them and the public authorities, was not doubted. Colonel Fletcher, a poor and profligate
man, was governor at that time. He was beyond doubt concerned with the freebooters, as also
was William Nicoll, a member of the privy council. Complaints upon this subject having reached
England, Fletcher was succeeded, in 1695, by the Earl of Bellamont, the appointment being made
in the belief that, from his rank and the wealth of his character, he would be able to retrieve
the character of the Colonial Government.

Justice, however, to the memory of Kidd requires it to be said that he was not at that period,
so far as it is known, a pirate himself. Before Lord Bellamont sailed from England for his
government, he met with Robert Livingston of New York--the ancestor of the Livingstons of Livingston's
Manor--with whom he held a conversation respecting the pirates, and the best means that could
be adopted to put them down. The project of employing a swift-sailing armed ship of thirty
guns, and one hundred and fifty men, to cruise against them, was spoken of; and Livingston
recommended his lordship to Kidd, as a man of integrity and courage, acquainted with the pirates
and their places of rendezvous, and as one in all respects fit to be intrusted with the command
of a vessel engaged in such a difficult service. He had, indeed, commanded a privateer, in
regular commission, against the pirates in the West Indies, in which service he had acquitted
himself as a brave and adventurous man. The project not being entertained by the Board of Admiralty,
a private adventure against the pirates was suggested by Mr. Livingston, one fifth part of
the stock of which he would take himself, besides becoming security for the good conduct of
Kidd. The proposition was approved by the king, who became interested to the amount of one
tenth; and the residue of the expense was supplied by Lord Chancellor Somers, the Duke of Shrewsbury,
the Earls of Romney and Oxford, and Sir Edmund Harrison and others. The ship having been procured
and equipped, Kidd sailed for New York under a regular commission, in April, 1696--the direction
of the enterprise being committed to the Earl of Bellamont and himself. For a time he served
faithfully and with advantage to the commerce of the colonies and mother country; for which
services he received much public applause, and another grant from the colony of two hundred
and fifty pounds. Tradition, moreover, says that, on visiting the government house, he was
received with public honors, and invited to a seat with the speaker of the House of Assembly.

On his next voyage, however, he stretched away to the Indian ocean, and turned pirate himself.
Selecting the island of Madagascar as his principal place of rendezvous, and burning his own
ship after having captured one that suited him better, his depredations upon the commerce of
all nations were represented to have been great. It is said that he 'ranged over the Indian
coast from the Red sea to Malabar, and that his depredations extended from the Eastern ocean
back along the Atlantic coast of South America, through the Bahamas, the whole of the West
Indies, and the shores of Long Island.' But it will presently be seen that this statement must
have been an exaggeration, as time was not afforded for operations so extensive before his arrest.

It is beyond doubt true that Long Island contained several of his hiding places. 'Kidd's Rock'
is well known at Manhasset, upon Long Island, to this day. Here he was supposed to have buried
some of his treasures, and many have been the attempts of the credulous to find the hidden
gold, but it could not be found. There is also no doubt that he was wont to hide himself and
his vessel among those curious rocks in Sachem's Head Harbor, called the Thimble islands. There
is also upon one of those rocks, sheltered from the view of the Sound, a beautiful artificial
excavation of an oval form, holding perhaps the measure of a barrel, called 'Kidd's Punch Bowl.'
It was here, according to the legend of the neighborhood, that he used to carouse with his
crew. It is a fact, however, beyond controversy, that he was accustomed to anchor his vessel
in Gardner's bay. On one occasion, in the night, he landed upon Gardner's island, and requested
Mrs. Gardner to provide a supper for himself and his attendants. Knowing his desperate character,
she dared not refuse, and fearing his displeasure, she took great pains, especially in roasting
a pig. The pirate chief was so pleased with her culinary success, that, on going away, he presented
her with a cradle blanket of gold cloth. On another occasion, also, when he landed at the island,
he buried a small casket of gold, silver, and precious stones in presence of Mr. Gardner, but
under the most solemn injunctions of secrecy.

Repairing soon afterward to Boston, where Lord Bellamont happened to be at the time, he was
summoned before his lordship, and directed to give a report of his proceedings in the service
of his company. Refusing to comply with this demand, he was arrested on the third of July,
1699, on the charge of piracy. He appears to have disclosed the fact of having buried the treasure
at Gardner's island, for the same was demanded by his lordship, and surrendered by Mr. Gardner.
I have conversed with a gentleman who has seen the original receipt for the amount, with the
different items of the deposit. The amount was by no means large, and affords evidence of no
such mighty sweepings of the seas as have been told of in story and in song. Of gold, in coins,
gold dust, and bars, there were seven hundred and fifty ounces. Of silver, five hundred and
six ounces, and of precious stones about sixteen ounces.

Lord Bellamont wrote home for a ship of war, to carry Kidd to England for trial. The 'Rochester'
was despatched upon that service, but being obliged to put back, a general suspicion prevailed
in England that there was collusion between the pirates and the ministers, and, in fact, that
they dared not bring the sea robber home for trial, lest it should be discovered that the Lord
Chancellor and his noble associates in the enterprise were confederates in the piracies also.
Party spirit ran high, and the opponents of the ministers brought a resolution into the House
of Commons for excluding from place all the partners of Kidd in the original enterprise. And
although this resolution was voted down, yet the Tories contrived afterward to impeach the
Whig lords upon the charge of having been concerned with Kidd. But the articles were not sustained.
Meanwhile Kidd had been taken to England, tried on an indictment for piracy and murder, and
hung in chains, with six of his crew. In addition to the indictment for piracy, he was indicted
for the murder of one of his own subordinate officers, named Moore, whom he killed in a quarrel,
by striking him over the head with a bucket. He was convicted upon both charges, but protested
to the last that he was the victim of conspiracy and perjury.

But, after all, suspicions were entertained by the public that the execution was a sham--that
the Government dared not put him to death; and that, to avoid disclosures, a man of straw was
hung in his place. In proof of this assertion, it was gravely and strongly alleged that Kidd
had been seen alive and well, many years afterward, by those who could not be mistaken as to
his identity. I think there is no doubt, however, of his having been honestly hung at 'Execution
Dock,' in London, on the 12th of May, 1701. Yet, when compared with the nobler villains, Lolonois
and Morgan, Kidd must have been a pirate upon an insignificant scale--a mere bottle imp by
the side of Satan, as portrayed in stupendous grandeur by Milton!

UNDER THE PALMETTO.

On Saturday, the 31st of January, 1863, the steamer 'S.R. Spaulding,' flagship of General Foster's
fleet, left the harbor of Morehead City, N. C., on a supposed expedition to some point on the
Southern coast. For two days we had watched from her deck the long procession of vessels moving
slowly round Fort Macon, and then, with all sails set, or under full head of steam, passing
proudly on in their southward course. Only those who have witnessed such scenes can realize
the eager interest and intense excitement which attend the preparation for a naval expedition.
Then, too, there were glories of the past to kindle hope and stimulate ambition. The successes
of Burnside, Du Pont, and Farragut were fresh in memory, and why should not we win new laurels
for the old flag, and place our commander's name high on the list of fame? And so, with feelings
of pride and expectation, we gladly saw the shores of North Carolina with their forests of
pines recede from sight, as, under a cloudless sky and over a waveless sea, we glided on toward
the hated mother State of the rebellion.

The sequel of the 'Foster Expedition' is well known. We anchored, on the 2d of February, in
the capacious harbor of Port Royal, and were flagship no longer. Fortunately, the long interval
between our arrival and the final departure for Charleston under another commander, gave abundant
opportunities for studying new phases of life and character, and for learning something of
the 15,000 freedmen who compose the loyal population of the Sea islands.

ON THE PLANTATIONS.

A geographical description of these outlying islands of South Carolina is hardly necessary
at a time when we are studying the map of the republic under the guidance of bayonets and rifled
cannon; and the guns of Admiral Du Pont revealed more of Port Royal and its surroundings than
we should ever have learned from our geographies. Previous to the rebellion these islands seem
to have been rarely visited--so rarely, indeed, that the presence of one of our naval vessels
in the Beaufort river, a few years ago, was the signal for a week's festivities and a general
gathering of all the inhabitants to see the strangers--while the 'cotton lords' vied with each
other in entertaining the distinguished guests. For the most part the islands are low, abounding
in salt-water creeks and marshes, and covered, here and there, with forests of pine and live
oak. The climate in winter is delightful, and the rapid advance of vegetation in March and
April--the sudden bursting into bloom of a great variety of flowers and flowering shrubs--lends
additional charms to the early spring. Sitting, on one of those delicious April days, in the
upper piazza of an old plantation house--the eye resting on the long stretch of the cotton
fields, now green with the growing plant--or tracing the windings of the creek through the
numerous small islands, till it is lost in the haze which covers all the distance--or, again,
watching the shadows as they pass over the groves of oak and pine--while over the whole scene
there broods the stillness of a midsummer's noon--I could but wonder at the madness which had
driven the former dwellers in such a fair land into the desperate hazards and unaccustomed
privations of civil war.

Those who visit these islands to-day, must not expect to realize, in the altered condition
of affairs, their ideal of plantation life, however that ideal may have been formed. The change
which has been wrought in little more than a year, is truly wonderful. The traces of slavery
may indeed be found in an exhausted soil and an exhausted race, but all outward signs of the
institution have been removed. 'The whip is lost, the handcuff broken,' the whipping post destroyed,
and the cotton gins broken down. At the 'great house' you find, instead of the master and overseer,
the superintendent and school teacher. In the field, the cotton tasks are comparatively small,
but the garden patch in the rear of the cabin is large, well fenced in and well cultivated.
If you see few indications of positive happiness, you find no appearances of overburdened misery.
There is about the whole place something of the air of a New England farmstead, where labor,
being honored, crowns even the humblest with dignity and peace. You take unspeakable comfort
in the fact, that, open what door you may into the life of these people, there is no skeleton
of oppression to startle and haunt you. Go with me, then, on this calm, bright day of early
March, to visit one of the plantations on Port Royal Island, a few miles out of Beaufort. The
quartermaster kindly furnishes us with a carriage, somewhat shabby and rickety to be sure,
but one of the best that 'Secesh' has left for our use. Our steeds, too, are only slow-moving
Government mules, but there is one aristocratic feature of our establishment to remind us of
the life that was, viz.: a negro coachman 'educated to drive,' under whose skilful guidance
many a happy family party have been conveyed from plantation to plantation on social visits
like ours to-day. Uncle Ned speaks kindly of his 'ole massa,' and says he 'would hab stayed
wid 'um, ef massa hadn't run away from heself.'

'But why didn't you go with him, uncle?'

'Oh, sah, I could nebber go to de Secesh.'

Doubtless many more of the house slaves and body servants of the planters would have followed
their masters, had they not been deterred by fear of the rebel soldiers and hard work in the
trenches.

'Use your whip, uncle,' and away we go at a respectable trot over the principal road on the
island, which, from the fact of its having been made of oyster shells, is called the 'Shell
road,' and extends ten miles to Port Royal Ferry, at the extreme western point of the island.
Timely showers have laid the dust, and all the trees and bushes wear clean faces. In the yards
there are peach trees in bloom, beautiful crimson japonicas, the jonquil and snowdrop; while
everywhere by the roadside we see the ungainly form and coarse flower of the prickly pear.
Passing the rifle pits and picket station, we soon turn off from the Shell road, and pass through
what was formerly a handsome forest of pines, but which now has been cleared by the soldier's
axe, and rejoices in the title of 'pickpocket tract.' Few of the plantations lie on the main
road, and many of them, like the one we are now seeking, are approached only by going over
several cross roads and by lanes. Our last turn takes us into a handsome avenue of live oaks,
whose overarching branches are adorned with long ringlets of the graceful Spanish moss. In
the woods on either side of the drive way are dogwood and Pride-of-Asia trees in full blossom,
wild honeysuckle, and the sweet yellow jasmine which fills the air with its delicious fragrance.
As we drive into the yard, the plantation house suddenly appears to view, half hidden by the
dense foliage of magnolia and orange trees. Although called one of the finest residences on
the island, the house is inferior to many of our larger farmhouses in New England, and is a
simple two-story structure of wood, resting on brick piles, with a veranda in front. Just beyond
the path that leads by the house, is a handsome flower garden, while both in the rear of the
'great house' and beyond the flower garden are rows of negro huts. We are soon greeted by our
hosts--one, a brave Vermonter, who served faithfully in the army till disabled, the other,
a Quaker of Philadelphia, who has left family and friends to labor for the freedman--and ushered
into the principal room of the house, where we are presented to a party of the neighboring
superintendents and school teachers. Dinner is all ready, and we sit down to a right royal
entertainment, the chief dishes of which are portions of an immense drumfish cooked in various
fashion. Few entertainers can prove more agreeable than Northern men with Southern hospitality,
and we eat and make merry without even a thought of Colonel Barnwell, whose home we have thus
'invaded,' and who, perchance, is shivering in the cold, and suffering the privations of a
rebel camp in Eastern Virginia. We must not omit the praise due to our cook, a woman taken
from the 'field hands,' and whose only instructors have been our hosts, neither of whom can
boast of much knowledge of the art of cooking. It would, however, be hardly safe to trust to
an untutored field hand, as I once learned to my cost, when my contraband of the kitchen department
called me to dinner by announcing that the eggs had been boiling for an hour, and the oysters
stewing for twice that time!

HOME LIFE OF THE FREEDMEN.

After dinner we visit the negroes in their cabins. The home life of the freedmen is at once
the most noticeable and most interesting feature of their new condition. Even in former days,
however often the sanctity of their homes may have been violated, with however weary limbs
and suffering souls they may have gone to them, yet here they must have found their chiefest
joy. Now, the humble cabins have become transfigured, and we find therein not only joy, but
peace and comfort, and, indeed, in greater or less degree, every element of that domestic order
which makes the home the corner stone of our free institutions. I have frequently, when conversing
with the freedmen about the flight of their former masters, asked them why they did not accompany
them, and have invariably received the reply, 'Oh, sah, we couldn't do dat. We belongs yere.
Dese are our homes.' This strong attachment to the soil, which has been made still stronger
by the removal of everything which could in any way remind them of their former condition,
has proved to be the great lever to raise them into the dignity of free laborers. It is true
their cabins are not yet free-holds; but the assurance that, unless the Government itself fails,
no fault or misfortune of another can ever deprive them of their homes, puts them at once on
their good behavior, that they may retain in their possession what they prize so dearly. The
good results of this transformation of the home are seen in every direction. The marriage relation
is observed with a constantly increasing strictness. Family ties are knitted more closely together.
Parents take a deep interest in the education of their children, and the children become in
turn teachers to the parents of much that is improving and civilizing. In the field there are
generous rivalries between families to see which will cultivate the largest patches of corn
and cotton. Greater neatness and order are observable about the dwellings, and wherever new
cabins have been erected--always by negro carpenters--there has been marked improvement in
the style and comfort of the buildings. Freedom has also created new wants, and the freedman
purchases from time to time, as he has ability, articles of luxury and of ornament for his home.

I must, however, acknowledge a feeling of disappointment at not finding the negroes more joyous
in this new condition of freedom and progress. Those who know them best--the superintendents
and teachers--testify to the happiness of their daily lives and their light-hearted enjoyment
of all their blessings; but to the casual observer there seems to be a general absence among
the freedmen of that cheerfulness and mirth which he naturally expects to find in their homes.
A simple explanation of this fact may be found in the sense of insecurity which the uncertain
issue of the civil war that rages about them creates in their minds. They have seen one after
another of those islands which have been in our possession given up to the reoccupation of
the rebels; the disastrous battles of James's Island and Pocotaligo and the fruitless campaigns
in Florida are fresh in their minds; while that wearisome waiting for something to be accomplished
which spreads such a spirit of restlessness and discontent among our soldiers, is felt even
more keenly by the freedmen. There is very much in the uncertainties of their present condition
to justify the favorite allusion of their preachers, who often compare the freedmen to the
children of Israel before they had fairly gained the promised land. Until a permanent peace
shall give to these people that feeling of security, without which, though there may be contentment,
there can be little joyousness, it is absurd for us to 'require of them mirth,' or ask them
to sing songs of gladness.

FREE LABOR.

Cochin, in his admirable work on the 'Results of Emancipation,' asserts of the negroes: 'This
race of men, like all the human species, is divided into two classes, the diligent and the
idle; freedom has nothing to do with the second, while it draws from the labor of the first
a better yield than servitude.' Has this statement proved true on the Sea Islands? The prejudiced
are ready with their negative answer, and point to the comparatively small amount of cotton
raised during the past year. By such persons no allowance is made for the peculiarly unfavorable
circumstances under which the experiment of free labor thus far has been tried, and they are
only too happy to charge upon emancipation all the evils which labor has suffered from the
presence of our soldiers and the continuance of the war. The causes of the smallness of the
cotton crop produced last year, are obvious to the most careless observer. Owing to the late
arrival of the first company of superintendents who were sent from the North, no preparations
were made for planting till more than two months after the usual time. On many of the plantations
the seed used was of a poor quality, while it was almost impossible to find any implements
of culture or to obtain the necessary mules or horses. As a consequence of the late planting,
the cotton was not sufficiently advanced to resist the attacks of the caterpillars in September,
and for a month these insects held grand carnival on the yet immature plants, causing widespread
damage to the crop. The low wages offered to the freedmen by Government were no offset to the
attractions of trading with the army and navy, and all the negroes were ambitious to have some
connection with camp life. As a natural result of this condition of things, both the industry
and interest of the freedmen were drawn away from the cotton fields. Early in the season, also,
when the young crops required constant attention, all the able-bodied men were drafted into
General Hunter's regiments, and kept in camp till the fall. The influence of the draft upon
those who remained at home, added to the delay and smallness of the Government payments, made
the laborers discouraged at their prospects, disaffected toward the superintendents, and careless
at their work.

The obstacles in the way of successful agricultural operations, produced by the military occupation
of the islands, are still further evident from the fact that both provision and cotton crops
improved in proportion to the distance from the camps. Thus, on Port Royal and Hilton Head
Islands, where most of the troops were encamped, very little cotton was raised, and so small
a crop of provisions, that it became necessary for Government to ration many of the freedmen
during a brief period. On Ladies' and St. Helena Islands, away from the immediate vicinity
of the camps, very fair crops of cotton were raised, and nearly enough provision for the support
of all the laborers. The rations furnished by Government, and which have given rise to so much
unfriendly comment, were called for, either by the refugees from the mainland and adjacent
islands, many of whom had at first no means of subsistence, or by the freedmen on those plantations
so exposed to the camps and so harassed by the soldiers, that the crops which they were able
to gather failed to last them through the year. In one district on St. Helena Island, including
three plantations, which was under the care of a capable and judicious superintendent, of sufficient
means to advance his private funds to the payment of the laborers, the total receipts from
the sale of the cotton and the surplus provisions raised were more than double all the expenses
incurred in wages, clothing, and superintendence.

Such were the results of the first year's experiment. Early in the present year several of
the plantations passed into the possession of private individuals, and thus an important change
has been effected in the aspect of the free-labor problem. On the Government plantations, which
are under the care of salaried superintendents as last year, a uniform system of labor has
been adopted, embodying the results of previous experience. Under this system, the laborers
agree as to the amount of cotton land which they will cultivate, and are then paid twenty-five
cents a day for their work. At the end of the year they are to receive a bonus of two cents
per pound of unginned cotton for picking. This additional reward at once stimulates them to
exertion, and teaches them that steady and continued labor brings the best return. In addition
to raising the amount of cotton agreed upon, each freedman is responsible for cultivating corn
and potatoes enough for his own subsistence, and land is allotted for this purpose. The laborers
are also required to produce corn enough for the subsistence of the plantation mules and horses,
for the use of the superintendents, and for the subsistence of all the old and disabled persons
for whom provision is not otherwise made. As regards payments, the Government theory is most
excellent, inasmuch as it provides for partial payments while the work is going on, so as to
furnish the freedman enough money for his immediate wants, and then, by the bonus which is
paid at the end of the year, supplies him with an amount greater than his wages, to be laid
up or put out at interest. Unfortunately the practice of the Government has been most injurious.
The delay in the monthly payments during the past year, sometimes for as long a period as six
months, caused the laborers to become discouraged, discontented, and suspicious. Unlike the
soldier, the freedman is not clothed or fed by Government (except in the case of those who
are utterly destitute), nor can he, like other laborers, obtain credit to the extent of the
wages due him. Under these circumstances, the delay on the part of the Government in paying
the freedman has been not only unjust to the laborers but disastrous to the workings of the
free-labor system.

On the purchased plantations we find a wholly different state of things, and, as might be expected,
a great variety of systems of labor. Some of the best managers keep up the Government scale
of prices, but pay the laborers more promptly, and increase their wages by many indirect means,
such as giving them bacon and molasses in proportion to the amount of cotton land which they
cultivate, providing a store for the plantation, where the freedmen can purchase articles at
a much lower rate than elsewhere, keeping the cabins in good repair, building new ones, and
having always on hand the necessary plantation implements for facilitating the culture of the
cotton. Others pay higher wages, and also increase the bonus which is paid for picking the
cotton. Some promise the freedmen so much per pound for the cotton which they shall raise,
and see that all their wants are supplied till the crop is gathered; while still others, from
lack of judgment or capital, offer the negroes a certain portion of the crop--in some cases
as high as two thirds--in return for their labor. On all these plantations the freedmen are
doing better than on those which are still retained by Government. The average amount of cotton
land which has been planted this spring is from an acre and a half to two acres for each 'full
hand.' Under slavery a full hand took care on an average of three acres, but it must be remembered
that all the able-bodied negroes, excepting only a foreman to each plantation, have been drafted
into the army, or are working in the Quartermaster's Department.

At the present time all indications point to a successful season. Riding over many of the plantations,
I have seen the negroes at work breaking up the ground or planting the seed, and everywhere
found them laboring diligently, and even showing a manly emulation in their tasks. Yet it would
be unreasonable to expect too much where so many obstacles beset the way. As one of the new
planters writes: 'For success in an experiment of free hired labor among ignorant blacks just
emancipated, conditions of peace and quiet are absolutely necessary. However, the difficulties
in our way are purely natural workings, and merely show that black is more nearly white than
is usually allowed.' Perhaps the greatest of these obstacles is the vicinity of the camps at
Beaufort and Hilton Head, which tempts the freedmen to leave their regular employments and
obtain an easy livelihood by the sale of eggs, chickens, fish, oysters, &c. Such markets affect
the blacks on the plantations just as the California fever affected the laboring men of the
North a few years ago; and it is a matter of surprise and congratulation that the presence
of the soldiers has not produced a greater demoralization among the negroes than we find to
be the case.

Five of the plantations were bought by the freedmen themselves, who are now carrying them on
as independent cultivators. Everywhere the freedmen, on hearing that the lands were to be sold,
were eager to buy, and it was found in many cases that they had saved considerable sums of
money from their earnings of the previous year. This almost universal desire of the negroes
to become landowners, is a complete refutation of the charge that sudden emancipation from
forced labor opens the door for the return of the blacks to barbarism.

The conditions under which the trial of free labor is now carried on in South Carolina, are
unparalleled in history. Those who are familiar with the results of emancipation in the French
and English colonies, will find few points of comparison between those results and the present
workings of freedom on the Sea Islands. Consider that at no previous time, and in no other
country, has there ever been an immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery. France, in
the frenzy of the Revolution, declared that slavery was abolished, but was forced to reëstablish
it under the Consulate; and, during the half century which followed before the complete and
final emancipation of the slaves in 1848, we find continually acts and measures adopted which
gradually paved the way to this ultimate success. England, too, after the abolition of the
slave trade, made repeated efforts to ameliorate the condition of the slave population of her
colonies, and when, in 1833, the Act of Emancipation was passed, it was found that, while declaring
all slaves on English soil to be instantly free, it made provisions for transforming them into
apprenticed laborers. In South Carolina, emancipation, proclaimed by the guns of Admiral Du
Pont, was instant, unlooked for, and without conditions. However ardently it may have been
desired by the slaves themselves, they surely could not have expected it, at a time when the
belief universally prevailed among the planters that the forts which defended their islands
were impregnable.

In the colonies of France and England, there was no civil war, bringing into the midst of the
plantations the demoralizing influences of the camp, harassing the simple-minded freedmen with
constant fear of reverses, which would consign them to a worse bondage than they had ever known,
and tending, in the absence of all civil law and the restraints of a well-ordered society,
to draw away the laborer from the cultivation of the soil. In South Carolina, moreover, no
masters or overseers were left, as in the French and English colonies, to direct the negroes
in their labor; and, in consequence, their guidance has been intrusted to a body of superintendents
from the North, most of them young men, and all without experience, either in the management
of the blacks or the culture of the cotton. This complete separation of the freedmen from their
former masters, by reason of the flight and escape of all the planters, has been, in many respects,
most favorable to their progress in liberty. Consider for a moment what would have been the
result if, at any time during the past thirty years, it had been possible to effect the abolishment
of slavery in these islands by an act of the General Government. Who can doubt that such an
act, passed against the wills of the slaveholders, would have produced the most disastrous
consequences, and that such an experiment of free labor as is now going on would have been
utterly impossible? Those, at least, who have had opportunities for observing the bitter hate
engendered toward the negroes, among those masters whom the proclamation of the 1st of January
deprived of their former 'chattels,' cannot but regard with satisfaction such peaceful solutions
of this fearful problem as that effected at Port Royal, where the shot and shell of our gunboats,
in breaking the chains of the slave, at the same moment compelled the master to flight.

RELIGION OF THE FREEDMEN.

The religious condition of the South Carolina freedmen presents many peculiar and interesting
features. Whether, like the negroes in the 'old North State,' they celebrated their new birth
into freedom by services of praise and thanksgiving at the altar, I have been unable to learn;
but certain it is, that the wonderful tranquillity of their sudden transition from bondage,
and the good use which they have made of their liberty, are owing in great measure to their
deep religious earnestness. This earnestness, it is evident, is not the result of conviction
or enlightenment, so much as of the strong emotional nature of the blacks, intensified by sympathy,
and kept alive to religious feeling by their frequent meetings for prayer and praise. Yet,
to the careful observer, the blind and often superstitious worship of these people, which,
as is now so plainly seen, was fostered by slavery, is one of the saddest results of the system.
Those who are now permitted to watch over the religious progress of the freedmen, can bring
new and abundant proof to the assertion of De Tocqueville, that 'Christianity is a religion
of freemen.' The present opportunities for religious worship which the freedmen enjoy consist
of their 'praise meetings'--similar in most respects to our prayer meetings--which are held
two or three times a week on the plantations, and the Sunday services at the various churches
scattered about the islands. These services are usually conducted by white preachers, and are
attended not only by the negroes, but also by the superintendents, teachers, and many casual
visitors from the camps. At Beaufort and Hilton Head large and flourishing Sunday schools are
in operation. Most of the freedmen belong either to the Baptist or Methodist denomination,
and the fervor and zeal of the preachers of the latter persuasion always find a response in
the excitable and impulsive nature of the blacks. It is not a little singular that, while Cochin
can write concerning the freedmen in the French colonies that 'the Catholic worship has incomparable
attractions for the blacks,' we find the negro in our own country everywhere attracted toward
that sect of Protestants which has always been the most powerful antagonist to Romanism.

On Sunday, the 15th of March, in company with a party of superintendents and teachers, I attended
a service held for the freedmen on St. Helena's Island. Our ride from the plantation took us
through field and wood, till we reached the main road on which the church is situated. It is
a simple, unpretending structure of brick, shaded on all sides by handsome live oaks. Near
by is the small cemetery, and the drooping moss from the oaks hangs in sombre beauty over the
graves. Under the trees is a group of superintendents discussing the news and the last order
of General Hunter. As we ride up, a party of officers comes galloping in from camp, while from
the other direction is seen approaching a venerable carryall, conveying a party of lady teachers
from a distant plantation. The service has already begun, and the church is crowded with the
dusky auditors, while here and there may be seen a pew filled with 'white folks.' The day is
warm, so we can stand by the open window and take in the whole scene at a single glance. No
danger to-day of any manifestations of overwrought feelings; no groans nor excited shoutings
of 'Amen.' The preacher has taken his text from the first chapter of Genesis, and he is describing
the wonders of the creation. His sermon might properly be entitled a 'Disquisition upon the
Universe.' It is evident that his colored hearers fail to see the 'beauty and mysterious order
of the stellar world' which he is portraying, for most of them are already dozing, and the
rest are nodding their heads as if in sleepy assent to the undoubted truth of the good man's
words. He has overreached his mark, and hits neither the heads nor the hearts of his congregation.
At length the discourse is ended, and all rise to join in the closing hymn, which is 'deaconed
off' by the minister, and responded to by the negroes in a monotonous 'yah, yah.' They have
not recovered from the soporific effect of the sermon, and, besides, can hardly be blamed for
not catching the feebly uttered words. But their time is coming. No sooner is the benediction
pronounced, than one of the negro elders strikes up a well known hymn, and, suddenly rousing
from their stupor, the whole congregation join in singing in clear and ringing tones verse
after verse of the jubilant song. Then follow other hymns and chants peculiar to the negro
worship, the crude expressions of their deep emotional feeling. As we leave the church, we
are convinced that the religious teachers of the newly freed blacks are sadly at fault in repeating
so much the kind of preaching to which the negroes were accustomed under the old system, and
in neglecting to pour into their perceptive souls both the light and warmth of the Gospel.
As an officer remarked who had stood at our side listening to the service: 'These people had
enough of the Old Testament thrown at their heads under slavery. Now give them the glorious
utterances and practical teachings of the Great Master.'

At some of the meetings of the freedmen, they are addressed by negro preachers, who never fail
to speak with great effect. In Alexandria, Va., I was told by the superintendent of the freedmen
of an old negro teacher and exhorter, the self-elected pastor of all the blacks there, going
about from house to house to minister to the wants of the sick and afflicted, teaching the
young, and speaking in all the meetings. 'This old negro,' said the superintendent, 'has more
influence over the blacks, and does more good among them, than all the missionaries and chaplains
who have been sent here.' To the same effect is the testimony of all who have listened to the
colored preacher at Port Royal, and who know the great power which the chief elders of their
churches possess over the rest of the negroes. A verbatim report of an exhortation given, just
before the expedition to Jacksonville, Fla., to the soldiers of Colonel Higginson's 1st South
Carolina Volunteers, by one of these negro preachers, would be worthy a place in 'American
Oratory.' I remember only one striking passage, where, in his appeal to the troops to fight
bravely, he urged them to seek always the post of danger, since heaven would be the immediate
reward of all who should be killed in battle; for, said he, as if moved by an oracle: 'What
hab been, dat will be. He who is de fust man to get into de boat, and de fust to jump on shore,
him, if he fall, will be de fust to get to heaben.' Then, as if standing already in the midst
of the fight, and with all the feelings of his nature roused against his enemies, he added:
'An' when de battle comes--when you see de Kunn'l put his shoulder to de wheel, and hear de
shot and shell flying all round like de rain drops, den remember dat ebery one ob dose shot
is a bolt ob de Almighty God to send dem rebels to deir eberlasting damnation.' Such fervent
utterances are not uncommon among the negro preachers, and are well calculated to produce a
powerful effect upon the susceptible natures of their hearers, 'deep answering unto deep.'

NEGRO 'SHOUTS' AND SHOUT SONGS.

At the 'praise meetings' on the plantations, one of the elders usually presides, and conducts
the exercises with great solemnity. Passages of Scripture are quoted from memory, and the hymns,
which constitute the principal feature of the meeting, are deaconed off as at church. Sometimes
the superintendent or one of the teachers attends these meetings, and is then expected to conduct
the exercises and make an address. After the praise meeting is over, there usually follows
the very singular and impressive performance of the 'Shout,' or religious dance of the negroes.
Three or four, standing still, clapping their hands and beating time with their feet, commence
singing in unison one of the peculiar shout melodies, while the others walk round in a ring,
in single file, joining also in the song. Soon those in the ring leave off their singing, the
others keeping it up the while with increased vigor, and strike into the shout step, observing
most accurate time with the music. This step is something halfway between a shuffle and a dance,
as difficult for an uninitiated person to describe as to imitate. At the end of each stanza
of the song the dancers stop short with a slight stamp on the last note, and then, putting
the other foot forward, proceed through the next verse. They will often dance to the same song
for twenty or thirty minutes, once or twice, perhaps, varying the monotony of their movement
by walking for a little while and joining in the singing. The physical exertion, which is really
very great, as the dance calls into play nearly every muscle of the body, seems never to weary
them in the least, and they frequently keep up a shout for hours, resting only for brief intervals
between the different songs. Yet, in trying to imitate them, I was completely tired out in
a very short time. The children are the best dancers, and are allowed by their parents to have
a shout at any time, though, with the adults, the shout always follows a religious meeting,
and none but church members are expected to join. It is to one of these shouts of the negro
children that Mr. Russell alludes in his Diary when describing a visit which he paid to a plantation
near Charleston in April, 1861. He speaks of the children as a set of 'ragged, dirty, and shoeless
urchins, who came in shyly, oftentimes running away till they were chased and captured, dressed
into line with much difficulty, and, then, shuffling their flat feet, clapping their hands,
and drawling out in a monotonous sort of chant something about the 'River Jawdam.'' Such a
sketch conveys no idea of the shout as it may be witnessed to-day on any of the plantations
among the Sea Islands. You will find the children clean, and, in general, neatly dressed, coming
into the room when asked by the superintendent, rendering their impressive and oftentimes pleasing
melodies in a manner seldom surpassed in our schools at the North, while their 'shouting' reveals
a suppleness of limb and peculiar grace of motion beyond the power of our dancing masters to
impart.

There are many features of the negro shout which amuse us from their strangeness; some, also,
that strike the observer as wholly absurd. Yet, viewed as a religious exercise--and in this
light it is always considered by the older negroes--I cannot help regarding it, in spite of
many of its characteristics, as both a natural and a rational expression of devotional feeling.
The negroes never indulge in it when, for any reason, they feel downhearted or sad at their
meetings. The shout is a simple outburst and manifestation of religious fervor--a 'rejoicing
in the Lord'--making a 'joyful noise unto the God of their salvation.'

The words of the shout songs are a singular medley of things sacred and profane, and are the
natural outgrowth of the imperfect and fragmentary knowledge of the Scriptures which the negroes
have picked up. The substitution for these crude productions of appropriate hymns, would remove
from the shout that which is now the chief objection to it in intelligent minds, and would
make of the dance, to which the negroes are so much attached, a useful auxiliary in their religious
culture. The tunes to which these songs are sung, are some of them weird and wild--'barbaric
madrigals'--while others are sweet and impressive melodies. The most striking of their barbaric
airs it would be impossible to write out, but many of their more common melodies are easily
caught upon being heard a few times. This music of the negro shout opens a new and rich field
of melody--a mine in which there is much rough quartz, but also many veins of sparkling ore.

What, for example, could be more animated, and at the same time more expressive of the thought
conveyed in the verse than the following chorus?--the introduction to which is a sort of recitative
or chant:

    [music notation]

    I'd a like to die as a Jesus die, An' he die wid a freely good will, He

    [music notation]

    lay in de grabe, An' he stretchy out he arms, O, Lord, remember me.

    CHORUS. Lively.

    [music notation]

    O, Lord, remember me,  Do, Lord, remember me;  Re-

    [music notation]

    member me when de year rolls round, O,  Lord, remember me.

The words of the chant are evidently a very childlike expression of the wish to die with the
same good will and spirit of forgiveness which were manifested in the Saviour's death.

Of a very different character is the following verse, sung to the same recitative:

    'O, Death he is a little man,
    He goes from do' to do',
    He kill some soul, an he wounded some,
    An' he lef' some soul for to pray.'

A most striking contrast between the recitative and chorus, is presented in the following:

    RECITATIVE (Sung to one note like a chant, with a cadence at the
    end):--

    'I wonder why Satan do follow me so?
    Satan hab noting 't all for to do, long 'wid me.'

    CHORUS. Slow and forcibly.

The next song presents a greater variety in melody, as well as in the different verses, which
seem to have no connection whatever with each other. The 'Parson Fuller' referred to is the
Rev. Dr. Fuller, of Baltimore, who owns a plantation on one of the islands:

    [music notation]

    Dar's a meetin' here to-night, Dar's a meetin' here to-night, Dar's a

    [music notation]
                                                    ( 1. Parson Fuller sittin'
    on de
    meetin' here to-night,  I hope to meet you dar. ( 2. Little children learn
    to
                                                    ( 3.

The following has evidently been composed since the negroes became free, and expresses very
forcibly their feelings toward 'driber, massa, and missus':

    [music notation]

    Done wid driber's  dribin',   Done wid driber's dribin',

    [music notation]

    Done wid driber's  drib-in', Roll,  Jordan,  roll.

    2. Done wid massa's hollerin',
       Done wid massa's hollerin',
       Done wid massa's hollerin',
                  Roll, Jordan roll.

    3. Done wid missus' scoldin',
       Done wid missus' scoldin',
       Done wid missus' scoldin',
                  Roll, Jordan, roll.

    4. Sins so heaby dat I cannot get along,
       Sins so heaby dat I cannot get along,
       Sins so heaby dat I cannot get along,
                  Roll, Jordan, roll.

    5.

Perhaps the best illustration of the Scriptural patchwork which characterizes many of the shout
songs, is seen in the 'Lonesome Valley,' the music of which is very quaint and plaintive:

    [music notation]

    O brudder William, you want to get religion, Ri' down in de lonesome valley,

    [music notation]

    1. Down in de lonesome valley,  Go down in de lonesome valley, my Lord, Ri'
    2.

The third and fourth stanzas are:

    3. When Johnny brought a letter,
       When Johnny brought a letter, my Lord,
       When Johnny brought a letter,
                   He meet my Jesus dere.

    4. An' Mary and Marta read 'em,
       An' Mary and Marta read 'em, my Lord,
       An' Mary and Marta read 'em,
                   Dey meet my Jesus dere.

The example above given will convey a good idea of the general character of the shout songs.
Apart from these religious songs, there is no music among the South Carolina freedmen, except
the simple airs which are sung by the boatmen, as they row on the rivers and creeks. A tinge
of sadness pervades all their melodies, which bear as little resemblance to the popular Ethiopian
melodies of the day as twilight to noonday. The joyous, merry strains which have been associated
in the minds of many with the Southern negro, are never heard on the Sea Islands. Indeed, by
most of the negroes, such songs as 'Uncle Ned' and 'O Susanna' are considered as highly improper.
In the schools, many of the best songs which are sung in our Sunday and public schools have
been introduced, and are opening new sources of pleasure to a race so musical by their very
nature as are the negroes of the South.

While in Beaufort, I attended a concert given by a band of genuine 'negro minstrels.' The company
had taken the name of the 'Charleston Minstrels,' and was composed mainly of refugees from
Charleston, who were then servants to various officers in General Saxton's Department. The
concert was held in the Episcopal Church, and the proceeds devoted to the benefit of the sick
and wounded of the First South Carolina Volunteers. The first view of the performers, as they
sat round the stage, a dozen finely formed and good-looking negroes, caused the spectator to
fancy himself in the presence of the famous band of Christy, or some other company of white
Ethiopian serenaders. Soon, the opera glass revealed the amusing fact, that, although every
minstrel was by nature as black as black could be, yet all the performers had given their faces
a coating of burnt cork, in order that their resemblance to Yankee minstrels might be in every
respect complete. There were excellent voices among the singers, and some of the players handled
their instruments with surprising skill; but the presence of an audience composed entirely
of white people, and including many of the highest officers in the Department, evidently caused
great embarrassment to performers so unaccustomed to the stage. Not a single song which could
be called comic was included in the programme; and, with the exception of a few patriotic airs,
the songs were of the 'Lily Dale,' half-mournful sort. Between the pieces there was the customary
telling of anecdotes and cracking of jokes, some of which were quite amusing, while others
excited laughter from the manner in which they were told. As an imitation of our Northern minstrelsy
given by a band of uneducated negro musicians, the performance was a wonderful success. Yet
the general impression left upon the mind of the hearer was far from pleasing. One could not
help feeling that a people, whose very natures are attuned to harmony, are capable of something
better than even the most perfect imitation of those who have so grossly caricatured their race.

SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION AMONG THE FREEDMEN.

The education of the children of the freedmen was begun simultaneously with the work of employing
the negroes as free laborers. Teachers, both men and women, from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia,
accompanied the superintendents who were sent to Port Royal in March, 1862. The results of
their labors during the past year have been most encouraging, in spite of the changes and confusion
caused by the war and the numerous obstacles in the way of a steady and continued application
on the part of the children. The teachers in their reports all unite to attest the 'universal
eagerness to learn,' which they have not found equalled in white persons, arising both from
the desire for knowledge common to all, and the desire to raise their condition now so very
strong among these people. The details of these reports present few points of special interest
to the common reader. A common mistake, both of those who visit these schools for the first
time, and of others who have merely heard of their existence, arises from comparing the negro
schools, where children of all ages are to be seen, with our district schools in New England,
where difference of age implies a corresponding difference in attainments. 'What are your most
advanced classes studying?' is very often asked of the teachers, when a moment's reflection
would convince the inquirer, that the Primer and First Reader are the only books which we expect
to see in the hands of children who have but just learned their letters. Viewing the rapid
progress which these colored children have made in learning to read during the past year--many
of them being obliged to leave school and work in the field during a considerable portion of
the time--the retentive memories which they have shown in their studies, and their great eagerness
to learn, which requires no urging from parents or teachers, and which manifests itself in
the punctual attendance even of those who are obliged to walk from long distances to the school
house--we may well be satisfied with what has already been accomplished, and with the prospects
for the future.

As a general rule, the adults are as eager to learn as the children, and the reading or spelling
book is the almost invariable companion of the freedmen when off duty. On the wharves, in the
intervals between labor--in the camp, whenever a leisure moment is found--on the plantations,
when work is done--everywhere, you will see the negroes with book in hand, patiently poring
over their lesson, picking the way along as best they can, or eagerly following the guidance
of some kind friend who stops to teach them. Probably few of these adult students will ever
advance beyond a simple knowledge of reading, and many, doubtless, will stop short of this,
lacking the perseverance necessary to attain success. Most of the freedmen, however, are so
earnest and determined in their pursuit of knowledge, so patient and untiring in their efforts
to learn, and, withal, enjoy such keen pleasure in this awakening to consciousness of their
mental powers, that they cannot fail to elevate themselves thereby, and also to feel an increased
interest in the education of their children.

IN CAMP.

Negro soldiers on the Sea islands have long since ceased to be objects of wonder or curiosity,
and may be seen to-day in camp, on picket, or on detached service, everywhere doing their work
in a quiet, soldierly manner, and attracting no more attention than the white troops about
them. Through many difficulties, and against great opposition, they have conquered their present
honorable position in the Department of the South. The untimely draft of the freedmen made
by General Hunter in May, 1862, the violence and deception with which the order was enforced,
as well as the refusal of the Government to receive these regiments into the service, causing
the dispersion of the troops without pay and without honor, was enough to discourage all further
enlistment. But when, last winter, General Saxton called for volunteers, an entire regiment
was soon raised, and early in the present year, the 1st South Carolina Volunteers were ready
to take the field. Fortunately for the regiment and for the country, the services of Thomas
Wentworth Higginson, of Worcester, Mass., were secured as commander of this first regiment
of Union soldiers raised in South Carolina. 'The right man in the right place' has not become
so common a sight in our army, as to prevent our being thankful that so fit an appointment
was made and accepted. Surely we are but just beginning to learn what heroes we have, when
we see a man of high literary attainments, whose eloquent words, both spoken and written, have
contributed so largely to the physical, mental, and moral culture of his countrymen, laying
down the pen for the sword at the call of duty, and winning at once by his wisdom and skill
the two highest objects of an officer's ambition, the devotion of his men, and the commendation
of his superiors.

Soon after arriving at Port Royal, I paid a visit to Colonel Higginson's regiment, then encamped
about four miles from Beaufort. Setting out on horseback in company with one of the superintendents,
our ride took us along the banks of the Beaufort river, past cotton plantations, and through
pleasant woods bright with the golden blossoms of the pines. Although it was early in February,
we saw the negroes at work in the fields, 'listing' the ground--a process of breaking up the
soil with hoes--while here and there a solitary palmetto stood, like a scarecrow, as if to
warn away all invaders. We soon reached 'Camp Saxton,' which we found pleasantly situated near
a large and magnificent grove of live oaks, just at the bend of the river, where a fine view
is given of the winding stream, the harbor of Port Royal, and the low-lying islands in the
distance. The grove, which is the handsomest on the islands, was formerly part of a plantation
belonging to a master well known by his cruelty toward his slaves, and the tree which served
as the whipping post is still pointed out. A short distance from the camp, by the river side,
may be seen the remains of an old Spanish fort, built of oyster shells, and said to have been
erected in the year 1637.

To one accustomed to notice the sanitary appearance of camps, the neatness observable both
in the streets and tents of 'Camp Saxton' was an agreeable surprise. Few camps in any department
of the army are better policed, or present to the visitor such a general air of order and cleanliness
as this first encampment of Colonel Higginson's regiment. As we enter one of the streets a
company inspection of arms is going on, which displays to good advantage the proficiency of
the colored soldier in the minutiæ of his work. Soon after, we are summoned to witness a battalion
drill, and my companion, who has been both an army officer and a 'Democrat,' is extravagant
in his praise of the movements and evolutions of the troops. Before leaving the camp we visit
the snug and comfortable hospital into which Yankee ingenuity has metamorphosed the upper story
of an old ginhouse. The surgeon informs us that the most common disease in the regiment is
pneumonia, and that, in order to guard as far as possible against this, he has the middle board
of the tent floor taken up just at night, and a fire built on the ground, to remove the dampness.

We are careful to make our exit at the proper place, as negro soldiers on guard observe unwonted
strictness, and we hear of their having threatened to shoot the commanding general himself
for attempting to pass out at some other than the regular passage way.

I have seen the soldiers of Colonel Higginson's regiment on several other occasions than the
one above described, and have always found them displaying the same soldierly qualities. Their
picketing of Port Royal island has not been surpassed by any white regiment for the rigor and
watchfulness with which it was enforced. 'Will they fight?' is a question which the events
of the war are fast answering in the affirmative. The South Carolina volunteers have not as
yet met the rebels in close conflict; but, in holding captured places against large numbers
of the enemy, in passing rebel batteries on the Florida rivers, and in hazardous excursions
into the heart of the enemy's country, where they have been constantly exposed to the fire
of sharp-shooters and guerillas, they have behaved as bravely as any other regiments in the
service; while they have united to their ready obedience and prompt execution of orders, a
dash and fierceness such as might have been expected from their excitable nature when under
the stimulus of actual warfare. In view, therefore, of the admirable manner in which these
freedmen have performed all the duties of a soldier's life which have thus far been required
of them, it is fair to presume that in the fierce shock of open battle, they will acquit themselves
like men. A striking illustration of the wide difference between the theories of those who
oppose the use of the negro as a soldier, and the facts which the war is constantly revealing,
was furnished on our passage from North Carolina to Port Royal. 'Will the negro troops be clean?'
was asked of an officer of the regular army, and his reply was a highly wrought and imaginary
description of the horrible condition of the garrisons, and the fearful epidemics, which would
be occasioned by placing black soldiers in the forts on our Southern coast. The facts of the
case in reference to the comparative cleanliness of white and black troops showed that, while
the companies of regulars under this officer's care habitually neglected on ship-board the
simplest sanitary regulations, such as sweeping and washing the decks, the negro soldiers who
had been taken on our Government transports to various points on the Florida coast, daily observed
these important rules, gaining thereby the commendation of the ship's officers, and promoting
at the same time their own health and comfort. The explanation of this fact is found in the
prompt and unquestioning obedience of the black soldier, the peculiar characteristic of those
who have been accustomed in a state of servitude to execute the commands of those who were
over them.

The tide of public opinion is setting so strongly in favor of the use of negroes as soldiers,
that the present danger seems to lie in the direction of our indulging in too extravagant expectations
of their efficiency. We must not overlook the fact that, in the case of the former slaves,
as much depends upon the character of their officers as upon the valor of the men. Nor should
it be forgotten that among the freedmen who come within our lines, there is only a small proportion
of able-bodied men capable of enduring the hardships of the service. In too many instances
slavery has sapped the vigor of their lives, and the examinations of our surgeons have revealed
an extent of physical weakness which is truly surprising. There can, however, no longer be
any doubt in the minds of candid and loyal men, that the freedmen who are able to bear arms
will prove themselves valiant soldiers, jealous defenders of their own and their country's
liberties, and a terror to their enemies, who have so madly attempted to destroy both 'Liberty
and Union.'

A SPIRIT'S REPROACH.

    I stood beside the altar with a friend,
    To hear him plight his faith to a young bride,
    A rosy child of simple heart and mind.
    Yet two short years before, on that same spot,
    I heard the funeral chant above the bier
    Of a first wife--a woman bright as fair,
    Or blessed or cursed with genius, full of fire--
    Who loved him with a passion high and rare;
    Whom he had won from paths of fame and art
    To walk unknown life's quiet ways with him.
    My mind was with the past, when the loud swell
    Of music rose to greet the childlike bride,
    The organ quivering as with solemn joy:
    Alas! another voice breathed through it all,
    Reproachful, haughty, wild, but very sad;
    Near, though its tones fell from that farthest shore,
    Where the eternal surge beats time no more!
    Sadly I gazed upon my friend, to mark
    If his new joys were quelled by the weird strains:
    He heard it not--he only saw the face,
    Blushing and girlish, 'neath its bridal veil;
    Saw not the stronger spirit standing by,
    With immortelles upon its massive front,
    And drooping wings adown its snowy shroud,
    And sense of wrong dewing its starry eye;
    Nor heard the chant of agony, reproach,
    Chilling the naïve joy of the marriage song.

       *   *   *   *

    'Say, canst thou woo another for thy bride,
    Whilst I am living--ever near thee still!
    Renounce the faith so often pledged to me,
    Forget me, while I dream of thee in heaven!
    When the word love first fell upon my ear,
    I was a dreamer wrapped in pleasant thoughts,
    Dwelling in themes apart from common life,
    Nor needed aught for bliss save my still hours,
    My studies, and the poet's golden lyre.
    The stars revealed to me their trackless paths,
    The flowers whispered me their secrets sweet,
    And science oped her ways of calm and light.
    Yet love, like ancient scroll, was closely rolled;
    I had no wish to read its mystic page;
    Its wooing wakened in me wondering scorn,
    Its homage insult to my virgin pride;
    If lovers knelt, 'twas but to be denied.

    And yet it pleased to know myself so fair,
    Because I loved the Beautiful. We met!
    Dark, fierce, and full of power thy features were,
    Yet finely cut, chiselled and sculptured well,
    Reminding me of antique demigod.
    The dream of the wild Greek, maddened with light
    From Beauty's sun, before me living stood.
    Ah! not of marble were thy features pale!
    Like summer's lightning, lights and shadows danced
    As feelings surged within thy stormful soul.
    Full of high thoughts and poetry wert thou:
    I left the paths of thought to hear thee speak
    Of love and its devotion, endless truth.
    All nature glowed with sudden, roseate light;
    The waves of ocean, mountains, forests dim,
    The waterfall, the flower, the clinging moss,
    Were woven in types of purity and peace,
    To etherealize and beautify thy love.
    Marriage of souls, eternal constancy,
    Gave wildering love new worth and dignity.
    My maiden pride was soothed, and if I felt
    Repelled by human passion, still I joyed
    In sacrifice that made me wholly thine.
    We wedded--and I rested on thy heart,
    Counted its throbs, and when I sadly thought
    They measured out the fleeting sands of life,
    I smiled at Time--Love lives eternally!
    I was not blind to my advantages,
    Yet I became a humble household dove,
    Smoothing to thy caress the eager wings
    Which might have borne me through the universe.
    All wealth seemed naught; had stars been in my gift,
    I would have thrown them reckless all to thee!
    Two happy years--how swift they fleeted by!--
    And then I felt a fluttering, restless life
    Throbbing beneath my heart; and with it knew
    (I ne'er could tell you how such knowledge came)
    That I must die! A moment's dread and pang
    O'ercame me--then the bitter thought grew sweet:
    My passing agony would win the boon
    Of life immortal for our infant's soul;
    The innocent being, through whose veins would flow
    Our mingling hearts for ever--ever--one!
    We spoke of death, and of eternal life;
    Many and fond the vows then pledged to me:
    'If cruel death must sever us on earth,
    Rest calmly on my never-changing love;
    Now and forever it is solely thine!
    Thou art my soul's elect--my Bride in Heaven!'

    So deeply did I trust thy plighted faith,
    I nerved my ardent soul to bear it all,
    And calmly saw the fated hour approach,
    Nor quailed before the pangs of death to give
    Our living love to a fond father's kiss:
    Smiling I placed him in thy arms--then died.
    The songs of angels wooed me high above,
    But my firm soul refused to leave its loves!
    I won the boon from heaven to hover near,
    To count the palpitations of thy heart,
    And speak, unseen, to thee in varied ways.
    I breathed to thee in music's plaintive tones,
    I floated round thee in the breath of flowers,
    I wooed thee in the poet's tender page,
    And through the blue eyes of our orphaned child
    I gazed upon thee with the buried love
    So fraught with faith and haunting memories.
    With spirit power I ranged the world of thought
    To twine thee with the blue 'Forget me not!'

       *   *   *   *

    Oh, God! thine eye seeks now a fresher face,
    Thy voice has won another's earnest love,
    Her head rests on the heart once pledged to me,
    And I have poured my worship on the dust!
    He loves again, and yet I gave him all--
    Been proud--is this 'the worm that never dies?'
    Ah, what am I?--a ruined wreck adrift
    Upon a surging sea of endless pain!
    Are human hearts all fickle, faithless, base?
    Does levity brand all of mortal race?
    When we shall meet within the Spirit's land,
    How wilt thou bear my sorrow, my despair?
    Wilt strive to teach me there thy new-found lore--
    Forgetfulness? I could not learn the task!
    Wilt seek to link again our broken ties?
    Away! I would not stoop my haughty brow
    To thing so false as thou! I love--yet scorn!
    We give ourselves with purity but once;
    The love of soul yields not to change of state;
    Heaven's life news the broken ties of earth;
    There is no death! all that has truly lived,
    Lives ever; feeling cannot die; it blooms
    Immortal as the soul from which it springs!
    Why do I shrink to own the bitter truth?
    I never have been loved--'twas mockery all!'

       *   *   *   *

    Thus sang the tortured spirit, while the chant
    Of the new bridal filled the quivering air.
    The ring of gold upon the finger placed,
    The girlish blushes, the groom's joyous smile,
    Told all was over, and the crowd dispersed:
    But the high face of the wrung spirit pressed
    Upon my heart, haunting me with its woe.
    What was her doom? Was she midst penal fires,
    Whose flames must burn away the sins of life,
    The hay and stubble of idolatrous love?
    Ah, even in its root crime germs with doom!
    Must suffering consume our earthly dross?
    Is't pain alone can bind us to the Cross?
    She worshipped man; true to his nature, he
    Remained as ever fickle, sensuous, weak.
    'Love is eternal!' True, but God alone
    Can fill the longings of an immortal soul:
    The finite thirst is for the Infinite!

JEFFERSON DAVIS AND REPUDIATION.

Soon after my arrival in London from New York, my attention was called, by some English, as
well as American friends, to an article which had appeared more than a month previously in
the London Times of the 23d of March last. In the money article of that date is the following
letter from the Hon. John Slidell, the Minister of Jefferson Davis at Paris.

     'MY DEAR SIR:

     I have yours of yesterday. I am inclined to think the people of
     London confound Mr. Reuben Davis, whom I have always understood
     to have taken the lead on the question of repudiation, with
     President Jefferson Davis. I am not aware that the latter was
     in any way identified with that question. I am very confident
     that it was not agitated during his canvass for Governor, or
     during his administration. The Union Bank bonds were issued in
     direct violation of an express constitutional provision. There
     is a wide difference between these bonds, and those of the
     Planters' Bank, for the repudiation of which, neither excuse
     nor palliation can be offered. I feel confident that Jefferson
     Davis never approved or justified that repudiation. What may
     have been his private opinions of the refusal to consider the
     State of Mississippi bound to provide for the payment of the
     Union Bank bonds, I do not know.

                                        Yours truly,

                                          'JOHN SLIDELL.'

It is due to the editor of the Times here to state, that, in his money article of the 23d March
last, he refers to the controversy of that press with Jefferson Davis on that question in 1849,
and, as regards the suggestion of Mr. Slidell, that it might have been Reuben Davis who was
the repudiator in 1849, instead of Jefferson Davis, the editor remarked, 'it is to be feared
that the proof in the other direction is too strong.' Indeed, the editor might well be astonished
at the supposition that Jefferson Davis, who subscribed the repudiation letter in question
of the 25th May, 1849, as well as a still stronger communication of the 29th August, 1849,
should have been confounded, during a period of near fourteen years, by the press of Europe
and America, with Reuben Davis, and that the supposed mistake should just now be discovered,
especially as Reuben Davis never was a Senator of the United States from Mississippi, or from
any other State.

I was asked if it really was Reuben or Jefferson Davis who was the author of the letter in
question advocating the repudiation of the Union Bank bonds of Mississippi, their recollection
being, that it was the latter. I said that the repudiation letter in question of the 25th May,
1849, was subscribed and published at its date in the Washington Union, by Jefferson Davis,
as a Senator of the United States from Mississippi, which position he then held, that he was
personally well known to me for nearly a fourth of a century, as was also Reuben Davis, and
that the latter never had been a Senator of the United States from Mississippi, or any other
State, as was well known to me, and would be shown by reference to the Journals of the United
States Senate. I stated, that I had represented the State of Mississippi in the Senate of the
United States from January, 1836, until March, 1845, when, having resigned that office, I was
called to the Cabinet of President Polk, as Secretary of the Treasury of the United States,
and remained in that position until the close of that administration in March, 1849. I added,
that I was in Washington City, the capital of the Union, and residing there as a counsellor
at law in the Supreme Court of the United States, when the first repudiation letter of Jefferson
Davis, communicated by him to the editor of the Union (a newspaper of that city), was published,
on the 25th May, 1849, in that print, and very generally throughout the United States. It was
remarked by me, that it was well known to myself personally, and I believed to every prominent
public man of that date, especially those then in Washington, that Mr. Jefferson Davis was
the author of that letter then published over his signature, and that he defended its doctrines,
with all that earnestness and ability for which he was so distinguished. I was also residing
in Washington, when Mr. Jefferson Davis published, over his signature, as a Senator of the
United States from Mississippi, his well-known second repudiation letter, dated at his residence,
'Brierfield, Miss.,' August 29, 1849. This letter was addressed to the editors of the Mississippian,
a newspaper published at Jackson, Mississippi, and was received by me in due course of mail.
This letter extended over several columns, and was an elaborate defence of the repudiation
of Mississippi. This letter also was generally republished throughout the United States. These
views of Mr. Jefferson Davis attracted my most earnest attention, because, after a brief interval,
he was one of my successors in the Senate of the United States, from Mississippi. I had always
earnestly opposed the doctrine of repudiation in Mississippi, and the Legislature of 1840-'41,
by which I was re-elected, passed resolutions by overwhelming majorities (hereafter quoted),
denouncing the repudiation either of the Union Bank, or Planters' Bank bonds.

At the period of the conversations before referred to, late in April or early in May last,
I was, on this recital of the facts, strongly urged to make them known in Europe, to which
my consent was given.

After some investigation, however, the necessary documents fully to elucidate the whole subject
could not be obtained here. It was necessary, therefore, to write home and procure them. This
has been done, and I now proceed to a narrative of these transactions from the authentic historical
public documents.

The first letter of Mr. Jefferson Davis before referred to, of the 25th of May, 1849, was published
by him as a Senator of the United States from Mississippi, over his signature, in the Union,
a newspaper published at Washington City. That letter is in these words:

     'DAILY UNION, WASHINGTON CITY, May 25th, 1849.

    'Statement furnished by Jefferson Davis,
      Esq., Senator of the United States.

     'The State of Mississippi has no other question with
     bondholders than that of debt or no debt. When the United
     States Bank of Pennsylvania purchased what are known as the
     Union Bank bonds, it was within the power of any stock dealer
     to learn that they had been issued in disregard of the
     Constitution of the State whose faith they assumed to pledge.
     By the Constitution and laws of Mississippi, any creditor of
     the State may bring suit against the State, and test his claim,
     as against an individual. To this the bondholders have been
     invited; but conscious that they have no valid claim, have not
     sought their remedy. Relying upon empty (because false)
     denunciation, they have made it a point of honor to show what
     can be shown by judicial investigation; i. e., that there being
     no debt, there has been no default. The crocodile tears which
     have been shed over ruined creditors, are on a par with the
     baseless denunciations which have been heaped upon the State.
     Those bonds were purchased by a bank then tottering to its
     fall--purchased in violation of the charter of the bank, or
     fraudulently, by concealing the transaction under the name of
     an individual, as may best suit those concerned--purchased in
     violation of the terms of the law under which the bonds were
     issued, and in disregard of the Constitution of Mississippi, of
     which the law was an infraction. To sustain the credit of that
     rickety bank, the bonds were hypothecated abroad for interest
     on loans which could not be met as they became due.

                                      'JEFFERSON DAVIS.'

To this letter the London Times, in its money article, of the 13th July, 1849, replied as follows:

     'The case of Mississippi stands thus: In 1838 the State issued
     bonds for five millions of dollars, to establish the Union
     Bank. These bonds were dated June, 1838, bearing five per cent.
     interest from date, and it was stipulated with the bank that
     they should not be sold under their par value. On the 18th
     August following, the bank sold all these bonds to the United
     States Bank for five millions of dollars, payable in five equal
     instalments in November, January, March, May, and July, but
     without interest. The money was punctually paid to the
     Mississippi Bank, and the Legislature of Mississippi, on the
     terms of the sale being communicated to them, resolved, 'That
     the sale of the bonds was highly advantageous to the State, and
     in accordance with the injunctions of the charter, reflecting
     the highest credit on the Commissioners, and bringing timely
     aid to an embarrassed community.' In little more than two
     years, however, the Mississippi Bank became totally insolvent,
     having lost the entire five millions invested in it by the
     State. Immediately on this having transpired, the Governor of
     the State sent a message to the Legislature recommending them
     to repudiate (this was the first time the word was used)
     their obligations, being founded on the plea, that as the bonds
     were issued with interest payable from the date, and they had
     been sold to the United States Bank for their nominal amount
     only, the stipulation that they should not be disposed of below
     their par value had been departed from. He further urged that
     although the bonds had been sold ostensibly to Mr. Biddle, the
     president of the United States Bank, the sale was actually to
     the bank itself, which, by its charter, could not legally
     purchase them. Hence, although Mississippi had received the
     money for the bonds, it was thus proposed to refuse to repay
     it, on the ground that the purchaser had no right to buy them.
     The Legislature, however, was not quite prepared for this, and
     accordingly, in responding to the Governor's message, they
     resolved: '1st. That the State of Mississippi is bound to the
     holders of the bonds of the State sold on account of the bank
     for the amount of principal and interest. 2d. That the State of
     Mississippi will pay her bonds, and preserve her faith
     inviolate. 3d. That the insinuation that the State of
     Mississippi would repudiate her bonds and violate her plighted
     faith, is a calumny upon the justice, honor, and dignity of the
     State.' But after this, the pecuniary condition of the State
     became rapidly worse, and the disposition to pay diminished in
     proportion. Accordingly a joint committee of the Legislature
     appointed in 1842, reported that the State was not bound to pay
     the bonds, advancing the reasons before mentioned, and also
     another, namely, that the bonds had not been sanctioned in the
     manner required by the Constitution, since, although the
     provision that no loan should be raised, unless sanctioned by a
     law passed through two successive Legislatures, had been
     complied with, and the bonds had been legally authorized, the
     act also prescribed certain conditions regarding the Bank of
     Mississippi, which conditions had been altered by a subsequent
     act, that had only passed through one Legislature.

     'In addition to the five millions thus repudiated, Mississippi
     owes two millions which she recognizes. It has always, however,
     been a difference without distinction, since she pays no
     dividends on either. From the period of repudiation up to the
     present moment, all representations of the bondholders have
     been treated with disregard. About a year and a half back,
     however, one of the citizens of Mississippi, a Mr. Robbins,
     admitted the moral liability of the State, and proposed that
     the people should discharge it by voluntary contributions.

     'The next step is the appearance of the letter from Mr.
     Jefferson Davis, with whom we are now called upon to deal.

     'Regarding the first part of the statement no comment could be
     made which would not weaken its effect. Taking its principle
     and its tone together, it is a doctrine which has never been
     paralleled. He begins as follows:

     'The London Times of July 13, 1849, contains an article which
     most unjustly and unfairly attacks the State of Mississippi and
     myself, because of a statement I made in refutation of a
     former calumny against her, which was published in the same
     paper.'

This article of the London Times Mr. Davis denounces as 'a foreigner's slander against the
government, the judiciary, and people of Mississippi;' 'very well for the high Tory paper as
an attack upon our republican government;' as 'untrue;' 'the hypocritical cant of stockjobbers
and pensioned presses' 'reckless of reputation;' 'hired advocates of the innocent stock dealers
of London 'Change;' 'a calumnious imputation.' These are pleasant epithets which Mr. Jefferson
Davis applied to the London Times and the London 'Change. But Mr. Jefferson Davis was very
indignant, not only with London, but with all England; for he says,

     'With far more propriety might repudiation be charged on the
     English Government, for the reduction of interest on her
     loans when she consolidated her debts; for the income tax,
     which compels fundholders to return part of the interest they
     receive on their evidences of public debt, for the support of
     the Government which is their debtor.'

According, then, to Mr. Jefferson Davis, the London Times and the London 'Change are great
reprobates, and it is not Mississippi, but 'THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT' which has repudiated their
own public debt.

From such angry epithets and fierce denunciation, the reader will be prepared to find very
little argument in Mr. Jefferson Davis' second letter. He denies that Mississippi received
the money. But a bank, of which she was the sole stockholder, and whose directory was all appointed
by her, received it. They received it also for her exclusive benefit, for she, as a State,
was to derive large profits on the stock of the bank, which was hers exclusively, and was paid
for entirely by the proceeds of these bonds. Mississippi then, as a State, through her agents
appointed by her, received this money. All governments must act through human agency, and the
agency in this case, which received the money, was appointed entirely by the State. But this
is not all. The Bank, which was exclusively a State bank, and based entirely on the proceeds
of these State bonds, with no other stockholders, was directed by the charter to loan this
money, the proceeds of these bonds, only to 'the citizens of the State,' sec. 46, and so the
loans were made. The State, then, through an agency appointed exclusively by itself, received
this money, the proceeds of the State bonds, and the State, through this same agency, loaned
this money to 'the citizens of the State,' who never repaid the loans. The State then received
the money and loaned it out to its own citizens, who still hold it; and yet this money, obtained
on the solemn pledge of the faith of the State, her citizens still hold, and the State repudiates
her bonds on which the money was received, and Mr. Jefferson Davis sustains, indorses, and
eulogizes this proceeding. Never was there a stronger case.

Mr. Jefferson Davis reiterates in this letter his arguments contained in his previous communication
of the 25th May, 1849, so fully answered by the editors of the London Times in their money
article before quoted of the 13th July, 1849. He elaborates, particularly, the legal position,
that the bonds were invalid, because he says not sanctioned by two successive Legislatures
as required by the Constitution of Mississippi. This statement is erroneous, because the loan,
in the precise form in which the bonds were issued, was sanctioned by two successive Legislatures
in perfect conformity with the Constitution. This is shown, as will be proved hereafter, by
reference to the laws passed by the State, and such was the decision on this very point by
the highest judicial tribunal of Mississippi, in 1842 and 1853. But let us suppose that there
was some technical legal informality as to the law, would that justify the repudiation of these
bonds? The Legislature had passed laws in 1837 and 1838 authorizing the issue and sale of these
bonds, those acts had been all signed and approved by the Governor of the State, the bonds
had been signed by the Governor and Treasurer of the State, the broad seal of the State had
been affixed to them by the Governor, they were placed in the hands of the authorities of the
State for sale, they were sold by them, and the full amount paid over to the agency appointed
by the State, and by that agency the money was loaned to the 'citizens of the State' and still
retained by them. When the sale of these State bonds in August, 1838, together with all the
facts and documents, were placed by the Governor before the Legislature in 1839, they ratified
and highly approved the sale, as before quoted by the Times, and again still more decidedly
in 1841. And yet the State, on the technical grounds stated by Mr. Davis, repudiated their
bonds. It was unconstitutional to return the money which they had borrowed and used! Could
anything be more absurd or dishonorable than this? The law says, if a man borrows money without
certain legal authentications, he shall not be forced to repay; but if he receives and uses
the money, and then interposes such technical pleas, he is justly deemed infamous. He has violated
his honor. And is the honor of an individual more sacred than that of a state or nation? State
and national debts rest upon faith, they repose upon honor, the obligation is sacred, and must
be fulfilled. It can never he illegal or unconstitutional to pay a debt, where the money has
been received by a state or a nation. And, where a State, acting through its supreme Executive
and Legislature, has issued its bonds and affixed its seal, and they have passed into the hands
of bona fide holders, the obligation must be fulfilled. For a state or nation, having issued
its bonds under its highest legislative and executive sanction, to say, that their own functionaries
mistook some of the formalities of the law, and refuse payments, is a fraud upon the bona fide
holders, and can never be sustained before the tribunal of the world. But when, besides the
Legislature and Executive of the State, its highest judicial tribunals have declared the bonds
perfectly constitutional and valid, and to have been sold in accordance with the terms of the
law, for such repudiation of such bonds it is difficult to find any language sufficiently strong
to mark the infamy of such a transaction.

If indeed the formalities of the Constitution had not been complied with, and this were not
a mere pretext, how easy would it have been to have passed a new act in conformity with the
constitutional formalities, assuming the debt, or providing for the issue of new bonds to be
delivered to the holders on the return of those alleged to be informal. But the truth is, this
alleged unconstitutionality was a mere pretext for repudiating a just debt: it never occurred
to the Legislatures which passed these laws in 1837 and 1838, or to the Governor, who signed
them, and was rejected by the Legislature in 1839, and again, in the most solemn form, in 1841.

And now let me trace the history of this transaction chronologically. The original act chartering
the bank, with the 5th section authorizing the loan, was passed by the Legislature January
21st, 1837, and again, in strict compliance with the provisions of the Constitution, reënacted
in the same words on the 5th of February, 1838. Now the bonds issued are in strict conformity
with this law, and an exact copy of the form of the bonds prescribed by the law. If then, the
supplemental act of the 15th February, 1838, was unconstitutional, null, and void, as contended
by the repudiators, then the whole original act remained in full force, and the bonds were
valid under that law, and such was the unanimous decision of the High Court of Errors and Appeals
of Mississippi, as will be shown hereafter. It was contended before the court (and by Mr. Davis
in his last letter) that, under the original law, certain acts were to be performed before
the bonds could issue. But here again, it is plain on the face of the law, and so the High
Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi unanimously decided, that these acts were not required
to be performed as conditions precedent to the issue of the bonds, and that the issue and sale
of the bonds were perfectly valid before these acts had been performed. The bonds then are
in exact conformity with a law, which was passed by two successive Legislatures, precisely
as provided by the Constitution.

In 1836 there was a great pecuniary embarrassment in Mississippi, attributed by many to what
was called the specie circular, and soon followed a suspension of the banks. Under these circumstances
there was an almost universal demand in Mississippi for relief measures. As a consequence,
the attention of the Legislature was absorbed almost exclusively in the consideration of remedies
for the existing embarrassments. The result was the enactment, on the 21st January, 1837, of
the law, creating the Union Bank of Mississippi. This bank was based upon loans to be obtained
upon bonds of the State, the proceeds of which, when sold, were to constitute the capital of
the bank, which money, by the terms of the charter, was to be loaned to the 'citizens of the
State,' to relieve the existing embarrassments.

The fifth section of the act was the only one in which any authority was given for a loan by
the State, and any power to pledge its faith. That section, entire, was as follows:

     'That, in order to facilitate the said Union Bank for the said
     loan of fifteen millions five hundred thousand dollars, the
     faith of this State be, and is hereby pledged, both for the
     security of the capital and interest, and that 7,500 bonds of
     $1,000 each, to wit: 1,875 payable in twelve years; 1,875 in
     fifteen years; 1,875 in eighteen years; and 1,875 in twenty
     years, and bearing interest at the rate of five per cent. per
     annum, shall be signed by the Governor of the State to the
     order of the Mississippi Bank, countersigned by the State
     Treasurer, and under the seal of the State; said bonds to be in
     the following words, viz.:

     '$2,000. Know all men by these presents, that the State of
     Mississippi acknowledges to be indebted to the Mississippi
     Union Bank in the sum of two thousand dollars, which sum the
     said State of Mississippi promises to pay in current money of
     the United States to the order of the President, Directors, and
     Company in the ---- year ----with interest at the rate of five
     per cent. per annum, payable half yearly, at the place named in
     the indorsement hereto, viz.: ---- on the ---- of every year
     until the payment of the said principal sum: in testimony
     whereof the Governor of the State of Mississippi has signed,
     and the Treasurer of the State has countersigned these
     presents, and caused the seal of the State to be affixed
     thereto, at Jackson, this ---- in the ---- year of our Lord.

                                             'Governor.

                                             'Treasurer.'

The whole act, of which this section was a part, was passed by the Legislature and approved
by the Governor in 1837, and the entire section as to the loan as required by the provision
of the Constitution of the State, was referred to the action of the next succeeding Legislature.
That succeeding Legislature was chosen in November, 1837, and assembled, at its regular session,
in January, 1838. After full discussion in both houses, this act of 1837 was passed by large
majorities in both branches of the Legislature, and approved by the new Governor, A. G. McNutt,
on the 5th of February, 1838. The act of 1837, including the 5th section, before quoted, was
thus reënacted by the succeeding Legislature, without any change whatever. There was then a
full, complete, and undisputed compliance with the requirements of the Constitution, and, under
this act, thus sanctioned by two successive Legislatures, it is conceded that the faith of
the State was pledged, and that the bonds might be issued and sold. But it is contended by
Mr. Jefferson Davis in his first, as well as his second letter, before quoted, that the bonds
are invalid, because of the supplemental act of the 15th of February, 1838. Now, it will be
observed, that no change whatever was made by this supplemental act, in this 5th section of
the original act, before quoted, by which alone the faith of the State was pledged for the
payment of these bonds, and which section alone, as required by the Constitution, had been
referred to the action of the succeeding Legislature. No change whatever was made by the supplemental
act in that section of the original act, the bonds were issued and sold in precise conformity
with its provisions, and, indeed, these bonds, thus actually issued and sold, are a precise
and literal copy of the form of the bonds as given in the original act, as before quoted. The
supplemental act changed only some of the 'details' of the charter of the Bank, but made no
alteration whatever in the 5th section. This supplemental act, which is now denounced by Jefferson
Davis as unconstitutional, was passed, after the fullest investigation of this question, as
to the power of the Legislature, with favorable reports as to the constitutional power by the
joint Committee of both Houses. The Committee reported to the Senate, that, by a 'supplemental
bill' 'it is competent for this Legislature to alter and amend the details of the bill, incorporating
the subscribers to the Mississippi Union Bank, passed at the last session of the Legislature
of this State.' (Senate Journal, 103.)

The report of the Committee to the House was as follows: 'The said Committee are of the opinion,
that it is within the province of the Legislature to amend or change the details of the said
Mississippi Union Bank Charter,' &c. (House Journal, p. 117.) Such was the opinion of the joint
Committee of both Houses of the Legislature, which reported this supplemental act, which act
was passed by the vote of 22 to 3 in the Senate (Journal, 320), and 55 to 22 in the House.
(Journal, 329-30.) It would appear, then, that in the opinion of an overwhelming majority of
both branches of the Legislature of Mississippi, the supplemental act was constitutional; and
the act was approved by A. G. McNutt, the Governor of the State, and thus became a law on the
15th of February, 1838. Indeed, the idea that a subsequent Legislature could change none of
the details of a bank charter, because there was embodied in the act a separate and distinct
section authorizing a loan of money by the State, seemed to me never to rise to the dignity
of a question. Such, we have seen, was the view of the Legislatures of 1838, 1839, and 1841,
and such was the unanimous decision, hereafter quoted, of the Chancellor and Circuit Judge
of Mississippi, and of the supreme judicial tribunal, the High Court of Errors and Appeals
of the State, in two decisions, on this very point, and in favor of the constitutionality of
this law. One of these decisions was made in January, 1842, and the other in April, 1853. These
decisions were conclusive against the State, and binding upon the Legislature, the Governor,
and the people, for the following reasons. The Constitution of the State of Mississippi contains
the following clause:

     'ARTICLE II. Distribution of Powers.

     'Sec. 1. The powers of the Government of the State of
     Mississippi shall be divided into three distinct departments,
     and each of them confided to a separate body of magistracy; to
     wit, those which are legislative to one, those which are
     judicial to another, and those which are executive to another.

     'Sec. 2. No person or collection of persons, being of one of
     these departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging
     to either of the others, except in the instances hereinafter
     expressly directed or permitted.'

It is not pretended that any exception was made for this case. The contrary has always been
held by the courts of Mississippi. Indeed, as late as October term, 1858, this very question
was decided by the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, when it was ruled by the
court that 'the Legislature may not, therefore, exercise powers which in their nature are judicial.'
(Isom. v. Missis. R. R. Co., 7 George 314.)

In the 9th section of the 7th article of the Constitution of Mississippi is found the provision
on which Mr. Jefferson Davis relies requiring the assent of two successive Legislatures to
pledge the faith of the State. Immediately succeeding this provision is the following: 'The
Legislature shall direct by law in what courts suits may be brought against the State.'

These two consecutive sections of the same article of the Constitution, being in pari materia,
are to be construed together. Indeed, it is a well known historical fact, that this 9th section,
as regards the pledge of the faith of the State, which is now perverted to a wholly different
purpose, was intended to give greater solemnity and a higher credit to the bonds of the State,
as was likewise the provision in the same Constitution of 1832, sanctioning by name the Planters'
Bank bonds of the State (now unpaid), in consequence of which, they were sold at a premium
of thirteen and a half per cent. In pursuance of the provision of the Constitution before quoted,
the Legislature of Mississippi, in 1833, passed an act, designating the Court of Chancery as
the one in which suits might be brought against the State, with the right of appeal by either
party to the High Court of Errors and Appeals. That act was passed in 1833, in pursuance of
this mandatory provision of the Constitution before quoted. That act provided, that, if the
decree of the court should be against the State, the Governor shall issue his mandate to the
Auditor to draw on the Treasurer to pay the decree, but 'no execution whatever shall ever issue
on any decree in chancery against the State of Mississippi, whereby the State may be dispossessed
of lands, tenements, goods and chattels.' (Howard's Dig. 523, 524.)

Here, then, are the two consecutive provisions of the Constitution in pari materia, the one
designating the mode by which the bonds of the State might be issued, and the other the judicial
tribunals in which all disputes as to such bonds might be definitively settled, and payment
made, if the decree were against the State. That Constitution vested the whole judicial power
of the State in the courts, it vested nothing but 'legislative power' in the Legislature, and
it prohibited the Legislature and Executive from exercising judicial power; it adopted the
great fundamental principle of constitutional government, separating the executive, legislative,
and judicial power. Indeed, it is the great doctrine of American law, that the concentration
of any of these two powers, in any one body or functionary, is dangerous to liberty, and that
the consolidation of all of these powers creates a despotism. The interpretation of a law,
and particularly of a constitution, which is made the 'supreme law,' the lex legum, has uniformly
been regarded as exclusively a judicial, and not an executive or legislative function. In this
case, however, it has been made clear by an express provision of the Constitution separating
these functions, and designating, under its mandate, the courts in which suits shall be brought
against the State, and the form of the decree to be rendered, and requiring payment to be at
once made. A suit is a judicial act, and so is the decree of a court. Well, then, the highest
judicial tribunals of Mississippi have twice decided this question; they have declared this
supplemental act constitutional, these bonds valid, and the sale of them to be in conformity
with the law; and, in a suit on one of these very bonds, after the fullest argument, the court
entered a decree of payment, overruling every point made by Jefferson Davis; and yet the State
still repudiates, as well after the first decision in 1842, as the second in 1853. It is difficult
to imagine a more palpable infraction of the Constitution, or a clearer violation of every
principle of justice than this.

The State prescribes certain forms under which her bonds may issue; she adds to this, in the
very next section, a provision commanding the Legislature to designate the judicial tribunals
in which suit may be brought on such bonds against the State; those tribunals are designated
by the Legislature, namely, the Court of Chancery, with appeal to the High Court of Errors
and Appeals of the State; both those tribunals (including the Chancellor) have unanimously
decided against the State, and a decree is entered for payment of the bonds. And yet the State
persists in repudiation, and Jefferson Davis defends her course. When the High Court of Errors
and Appeals of Mississippi first decided this question, it was composed of Chief Justice Sharkey,
and Justices Turner and Trotter (one of the framers of the Constitution). When, again, in 1851,
suit was brought against the State on one of these repudiated Union Bank bonds, and a decree
for its payment rendered by the Chancellor, that decree, on full argument on appeal, was unanimously
confirmed by the highest judicial tribunal of the State, composed entirely of different judges,
namely, Chief Justice Smith, and Justices Yerger and Fisher. Here, then, are eight judges,
all chosen by the people of Mississippi, concurring in 1842, as well as in 1853, as to the
validity of these bonds; and yet Jefferson Davis justifies their repudiation. The judges of
Mississippi all take an oath to support the Constitution, and it is made their duty to interpret
it, and especially this very clause: the Legislature is confined to law making, and forbidden
to exercise any judicial power; the expounding this supplemental law, and the provisions under
which it was enacted, is exclusively a judicial power, and yet the Legislature usurps this
power, repudiates the bonds of the State, and the acts of three preceding Legislatures, and
the decision of the highest tribunals of the State: Jefferson Davis sustains this repudiation,
and the British public are asked to take new Confederate bonds, issued by the same Jefferson
Davis, and thus to sanction, and encourage, and offer a premium for repudiation. These so-called
Confederate bonds are issued in open violation of the Constitution of the United States; they
are absolute nullities, they are tainted with treason, they never can or will be paid, and
yet they are to be thrust on the British public under the sanction of the same great repudiator,
Jefferson Davis, who applauds the non-payment of the Mississippi bonds, and thus condemns hundreds
of innocent holders, including widows and orphans, to want and misery. Talk about faith, about
honor, about justice, and the sanctity of contracts. Why, if such flagrant outrages, such atrocious
crimes, can be sustained by the great public of any nation, small indeed must be the value
of their bonds, which rests exclusively on good faith.

Suppose some astute lawyer could find some informality in the law authorizing the issue and
sale of the bonds representing the British consols; would any member of either House propose
in Parliament to repudiate such bonds, and would not such a motion cause his immediate expulsion?
Yet, this is what the Legislature of Mississippi has done, what Jefferson Davis approves and
applauds, and what, he says, the 'English Government' has done.

The London Times has heretofore quoted the proceedings of the Legislature of Mississippi in
1839, approving the sale of these bonds and eulogizing the transaction. It has also referred
to the Message of Governor McNutt, of 1841, nearly three years after the sale of the bonds,
first recommending their repudiation, and to the resolutions of the Legislature of Mississippi
of that date, affirming the legality of these bonds and the duty of the State to pay them.
As these resolutions are of great importance, and ought to have closed the whole controversy,
I will state, what is shown by the Journals of the Senate and the House, that they passed both
Houses, in great part unanimously, and for the remainder, by large majorities. (Sen. Jour.
p. 312; House Jour. pp. 416-417, 249, 324-329.)

The objections made by Governor McNutt in 1841, were as follows:

     '1st. The Bank of the United States is prohibited by its
     charter from purchasing such stock, either directly or
     indirectly.

     '2d. It was fraudulent on the part of the bank, inasmuch as the
     contract was made in the name of an individual, when, in fact,
     it was for the benefit of the bank, and payment was made with
     its funds.

     '3d. The sale was illegal, inasmuch as the bonds were sold on a
     credit.

     '4th. Interest to the amount of about $170,000 having accrued
     on those bonds before the purchase money was stipulated to be
     all paid, the bonds were, in fact, sold at less than their par
     value, in direct violation of the charter of the bank.' (House
     Journal, p. 25).

It will here be remarked, that the great objection now urged by Jefferson Davis against these
bonds, namely, that the act under which they were alleged to have been issued was unconstitutional,
is not enumerated by Governor McNutt. Surely if such an objection existed to the payment of
the bonds, it must have found a place in this celebrated message. Is not this conclusive proof
that this constitutional objection was a mere afterthought and pretext of Jefferson Davis and
his associate repudiators?

Let us examine the Governor's objections. As to the 1st and 2d--the bank did not make the purchase;
the contract was made by an individual, although the performance was guaranteed by the bank.
As this is a mere technical objection, surely the Bank guarantee, even if void, could not affect
the contract itself. 2d. The purchase, even if made by the bank, was not of stock, but a loan
made upon bonds. 3d. The right of the bank to make the purchase is immaterial, if the money
was paid, as in this case, the bonds received, payable to bearer, and passed for value, into
the hands of bona fide holders. What an objection to the refunding the money--that, although
it was received, the purchaser of the bonds had no right to buy them, and therefore the bona
fide holders should lose the money. It might have been in violation of its charter for the
bank to purchase the bonds, but it was 'fraudulent,' when the money was received by the State,
to retain it, on the allegation, that the bank could not legally make the purchase, especially
when the bonds, in the mean time, had passed into the hands of bona fide holders. As to the
3d objection--as the money was paid before the objection was made, and the Union Bank authorized
to draw at once for the amount, at a point beyond the limits of the State, which it did do,
and realized a large premium on the exchange, and profit on the transaction, the objection
is as unfounded in law as it is in morals or good faith; especially as the bonds were payable
to bearer, upon their face, in exact conformity to the law, and had passed, for value, into
the hands of bona fide holders. Besides, there was no such restriction in the charter. The
only restriction in the supplement was, that they should not be sold below par. Suppose the
bonds for five millions of dollars had been sold for five millions and a half, payable in sixty
days, and the money paid at the time, it is equally absurd and fraudulent to contend, that
for such a reason, the whole money could be retained, and bonds repudiated. As to the 4th objection,
the original 5th section which passed two successive Legislatures, did not require that the
bonds should not be sold for 'less than their par value.' If, then, as contended by Jefferson
Davis, the supplemental act containing this provision, was unconstitutional, null and void,
then no such restriction existed, and the sale was valid under the original act. But the truth
is, the bonds were not sold below par, but above par, as shown by the High Court of Errors
and Appeals of Mississippi, in the decision hereafter quoted by me. Indeed, all these four
objections of the Governor, as well as those of Jefferson Davis, are shown in that decision
to be as unfounded in fact, as they were in law or morals.

But suppose the bonds were sold below par, that is, that the State had lost $170,000, or less
than four per cent., on bonds for five millions of dollars. Was that a just or valid ground
for repudiating the whole, principal and interest? The plea of usury is always disgraceful,
even if true, especially where the security was negotiable to bearer and had passed, for full
value, into the hands of bona fide holders. But if such a plea is disgraceful to individuals,
what shall be said when it is made on behalf of a State? And what shall be thought of those
who make such an objection? What of a Governor, or of a United States Senator, who urges such
objections on behalf of a State? Do we not feel as if the State were some miserable culprit
on trial, and some pettifogging lawyer was endeavoring to screen him from punishment, by picking
a flaw in the indictment. Yet such are the pleas on behalf of a State, urged by Governor McNutt
and Senator Jefferson Davis. On reference to the letter before referred to, of Jefferson Davis,
it will be found that he does not confine himself to the constitutional objections. That is,
the State should pay none of the money received, because the purchaser, as alleged, had no
right to buy the bonds--and because the sale was, as erroneously stated, an infraction of the
law, that is usurious, or a sale below par. He insists the money was not received by the State,
because, he says, 'Mississippi had no bank, and could not have a bank of issue, because forbidden
by the tenth section of the first article of the United States Constitution--'no State shall
emit bills of credit.'' Surely Mr. Davis must have known, that in the case of the Bank of Kentucky,
a State bank of issue owned exclusively by the State, it was decided by the Supreme Court of
the United States, that such a bank was constitutional, and no politician of the secession
school can object to that decision. (2 Peters 257.) But however this might be, what kind of
a plea is this? Why, if, as alleged by Mr. Davis, Mississippi had violated the Federal Constitution,
by establishing a bank of circulation, that therefore the bonds of the State should be repudiated.
Is it not incredible that a Senator should assume such a position on behalf of his State? But,
if this be sound, it clearly follows, that, inasmuch as the Confederate bonds are issued in
plain violation of the Constitution of the United States, those bonds should be repudiated;
so also if they were sold below par, or if there be any other technical objection. Nor will
it avail that the bonds may have passed into the hands of bona fide holders, for, Mr. Jefferson
Davis says, in his letter of the 29th August, 1849, 'If the bonds have passed into the hands
of innocent holders, the fact does not vary the legal question, as the purchaser could not
acquire more than the seller had to dispose of.' And again, he says, referring to the alleged
inability of the first purchaser to buy the bonds, 'The claim of foreign holders is as good,
but no better, than that of the first purchaser.' It is difficult to say which is most astounding,
the law or the morals of this position. At all events, 'the foreign holders' of Confederate
bonds are informed by Jefferson Davis, that this is the law. Indeed it is a singular coincidence,
that one of the objections made to the payment of the Union Bank bonds by the Governor, was,
as he alleged, 'the monstrous assumption of power on the part of the bank, in seeking to monopolize
the cotton crop of the State, and becoming a factor and shipper of our great staple.' (Senate
Journals, 29.) Why, this is what is being attempted by these Confederate cotton bonds, although
the State-rights strict constructionists of slavedom would in vain look for any clause in their
so-called constitution, authorizing any such transactions in cotton. And here, let me say,
that the objection of a Senator from Mississippi to the payment of her bonds, that, in issuing
them, her Governor and Legislature had violated their own Constitution, proposes to cure one
fraud, by committing another far more stupendous. The bonds were issued by the highest legislative
and executive functionaries of the State, the broad seal of the State attached, the bonds sold,
and the money received. In such a case, there is a legal, as well as a moral estoppel, forbidding
such a plea, for, by the English, as well as by the American doctrine, an estoppel excludes
the truth, whenever such proof would enable the party, who obtained money on false pretences,
to commit a fraud on third persons, by disproving his own averment. This is not a mere technical
rule, but one which is based upon experience, and sustained by the most exalted morality.

I have given the several objections made by Governor McNutt and Senator Davis to the payment
of these bonds, with one exception. This will be found in the following extract from the executive
message of Governor McNutt, (p. 502): 'The bank, I have been informed, has hypothecated these
bonds, and borrowed money upon them of the Baron Rothschild; the blood of Judas and Shylock
flows in his veins, and he unites the qualities of both his countrymen. He has mortgages on
the silver mines of Mexico and the quicksilver mines of Spain. He has advanced money to the
Sublime Porte, and taken as security a mortgage upon the holy city of Jerusalem, and the sepulchre
of our Saviour. It is for the people to say, whether he shall have a mortgage upon our cotton
fields and make serfs of our children.' I trust the baron will have the good sense to smile
at such folly, and realize how universally, at least throughout the North, the malice and dishonesty
of these suggestions was condemned and repudiated. We have no such prejudices, worthy only
of the dark ages, against 'God's chosen people,' 'the descendants of the patriarchs and prophets,'
and the 'countrywomen of the mother of our Lord.'

But this whole question has been twice unanimously decided by the highest judicial tribunal
of Mississippi against the State, and every point made by Governor McNutt and Jefferson Davis
overruled by the court. One of these decisions was in January term, 1842, more than seven years
before the date of Jefferson Davis's letters, and the other was at April term, 1853, nearly
four years subsequently.

The first decision, at January term, 1842, is in the case of Campbell et al. v. Mississippi
Union Bank (6 Howard 625 to 683). In this case it was pleaded 'that the charter of the Mississippi
Union Bank was not enacted and passed by the Legislature in compliance with the provisions
of the Constitution of the State, in this, that the supplemental act of 15th February, 1838,
the same being a law to raise a loan of money on the credit of the State, was not published
and submitted to the succeeding Legislature, according to the provisions of the Constitution
in 9th section, 7th article.' Here the direct constitutional question was presented, requiring
the decision of the Court. The case was most elaborately argued on both sides. The able and
upright circuit judge, Hon. B. Harris, had decided that the supplemental act was constitutional,
and the bonds valid, and the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, after full argument
on both sides, unanimously affirmed that decision. In delivering the opinion of this highest
judicial tribunal of the State, and the one designated by the Legislature in 1833, under the
mandatory clause of the Constitution, Chief Justice Sharkey said:

     'The second plea is, in substance, that the act supplemental to
     the charter of the Union Bank, was not agreed to by a majority
     of each House of the Legislature, and entered on the journals
     with the yeas and nays, and referred to the next succeeding
     Legislature, after publication in the newspapers, according to
     the provisions of the 9th section of the 7th article of the
     Constitution; but the said supplemental act made material
     alterations in the original act, and was only passed by one
     Legislature, and that no loan of money can be made on the faith
     of the State without the assent of two Legislatures, given in
     the manner prescribed by the Constitution.'--'I shall then
     proceed to notice the constitutional provision, and to inquire,
     by an application of it to the bank charter, whether the
     position can be sustained. The supplemental act
     makes no alteration whatever in regard to this section. It
     changes in some respects the mere details of the original
     charter, in the mode of carrying the corporation into
     successful operation, and authorizes the Governor to subscribe
     for the stock on the part of the State. The object of the
     pledge is not changed; on the contrary, the supplemental act
     was passed in aid of the original design. In applying the
     constitutional test to the 5th section, I am not able to
     perceive any reason which to me seems sufficient to justify the
     conclusion that it is unconstitutional.'

     'The plea presents no bar to the action.'

Justices Turner and Trotter concurred.

Mr. Howard, the distinguished State reporter, gives, in the heading of the case, the following
as the decision of the court. 'The act supplemental to the charter of the Union Bank, being
in aid of the charter, and changing the same only in some of the mere details, is a constitutional
act.'

Surely this decision should have settled the question. But it did not. The Governor, A. G.
McNutt, who had signed the laws authorizing these bonds, and the bonds themselves, anticipating
the decision of the court (as he indicates in his message) in favor of 'the holders of certain
bonds heretofore issued to the Planters' and Union Bank,' recommends the Legislature, in his
message of January, 1842, to create a 'revenue court,' the judge of which shall be appointed
'by the Executive or Legislature,' to which such cases should be transferred. (Sen. Jour. p.
22.) Thus the case, on the bonds, was to be taken from the high tribunal (where it was then
pending) created by the Constitution, and chosen by the people, and transferred to a revenue
judge to be appointed by the repudiating Governor and Legislature of 1842, of course a mere
executive parasite, or legislative minion, placed on the bench to repudiate the bonds. Fortunately,
such an appointment was forbidden expressly by the Constitution, and would have been disregarded
by the court; so this attempted usurpation failed.

The Governor says in that message:

     'It never was intended by the framers of the Constitution, that
     every public creditor should be permitted to harass the State
     at pleasure by vexatious suits. Neither the judgment of a court
     nor the decree of the Chancellor can be obligatory on the
     Legislature,' &c. (P. 17.)

In conformity with this recommendation of the Governor, the Legislature passed a series of
resolutions declaring that 'the Legislature is the exclusive judge of the objects for which
money shall be raised and appropriated by its authority,' &c.; that the Legislature has no
right to 'levy or appropriate money for the purpose of executing the object of a law, by them
deemed repugnant to, or unauthorized by the Constitution;' that the 'Supplemental (Union Bank)
Bill is unconstitutional;' that 'the bonds delivered by said bank, and by it sold to Nicholas
Biddle on the 18th August, 1838, are not binding upon the State,' &c. (Acts of 1842, ch. 127.)
But, unfortunately for these positions, the Constitution of the State had deprived the Legislature
of all 'judicial power;' it had vested this power exclusively in 'the courts;' it had, in the
very case of all bonds of the State, required and commanded the Legislature to designate the
courts in which such cases should be decided; it had, by the act of 1833, passed in obedience
to the imperative mandate of the Constitution, referred all such cases to the decision of the
Court of Chancery, with appeal to the High Court of Errors and Appeals; it had made their decision
conclusive; it had already appropriated the money, to pay all such decrees, and made it the
duty of the Governor to command the Auditor to draw his warrant on the Treasurer for payment:
this was the constitution of the law when these bonds were issued and sold in 1838--such was
the contract of the State, in regard to which the Federal Constitution declares, 'no State
shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts'--which clause has been uniformly
held by all the Federal as well as State Courts, to apply to contracts of a State--and yet,
in flagrant defiance of the highest duties and the most sacred obligations, the Legislature
passed these resolutions, to nullify the anticipated decisions of the court. We have seen,
however, that this executive and legislative usurpation was ineffectual. The court stood firm,
not a single judge wavered, and, by a unanimous decree, reversed the legislative and executive
repudiation--vindicated the majesty of the law and the Constitution--upheld the sacred cause
of truth and justice--resisted the popular frenzy, and defied the unprincipled demagogues by
whom the people of the State had been deceived and deluded. It was a noble spectacle, when
those three upright and fearless Judges, Sharkey, Turner, and Trotter, entered the temple of
justice, and declared to the people, by whose ballots they were chosen, that the State was
bound to pay these bonds, and decreed accordingly. The same sublime scene was reënacted by
a similar decree, in a suit against the State, on one of these bonds, by the same court, in
1853, then composed of different judges--Smith, Yerger, and Fisher. And not one judge or chancellor
of the State ever wavered. Amid all this heaven-daring iniquity, thank God! the judicial ermine
was unstained. Whilst constrained to denounce the repudiating Legislature, Governor, and Senator
of Mississippi, let me point to another green spot amid the moral waste and desolation of that
dreadful period.

With scarcely an exception, the Bar of Mississippi was true to the cause of honor, law, and
justice. They knew the objections of McNutt and Davis were wretched pretexts, and they vindicated
the reputation of that noble profession, which, in all ages, has been the champion of constitutional
liberty. They were men of the same stamp as their illustrious English ancestry, Hampden, Sidney,
and Russell, whose names cover the map of my country, and whose deeds have exalted the character
of man; and although the blood of our anti-repudiating heroes did not flow like that of the
British martyrs, as a sacrificial offering on the altar of freedom, they sacrificed ease, and
affluence, and ambition, and political preferment, and endured obloquy and reproach. I rejoice
in the recollection, that, during this contest they should have selected a sentence from my
address against repudiation, and placed it on their banners, and at the head of their presses,
in these words: 'The honor of the nation and of every State is the birthright of every American--it
is the stainless and priceless jewel of popular sovereignty--it has been preserved unsullied,
in all times that are past, through every sacrifice of blood and treasure, and it must be maintained.'
Ay! and it will yet be maintained. The time will come, when repudiation will be repudiated
by Mississippi--when her wretched secession leaders, the true authors of her disgrace and ruin,
will be discarded--when her insolent slaveholding oligarchy will be overthrown, when the people
will break the chains of their imperious masters, and labor, without regard to color, will
be emancipated. Secession, repudiation, and slavery are the same in principle and had the same
leaders. Jefferson Davis carried the repudiation banner in 1849, as he now does that of secession
and slavery. Secession is a repudiation of law, of constitution, of country, of the flag of
our forefathers, and of the Union purchased by their blood. Driven at home within a circle
of fire, which narrows every day, it is crouching before foreign rulers, and imploring their
aid to accomplish the ruin of our country. It appeals to their ambition, their avarice, their
fears, their hatred of free institutions and of constitutional government. It summons them
to these English shores, it unsheathes the imperial sceptre in the House of Commons, denounces
the Ministry of England, and dictates the vote of Parliament on the most momentous question
in the history of the world. Why, when these sentiments were uttered, I almost expected to
see the shades of Burke and Fox, and Pitt and Chatham, and Peel and Wellington, rise in the
midst and denounce the degenerate bearer of such a message. What! the British Commons become
the supple tools, the obsequious minions, the obedient parasites, to do the bidding of a foreign
master, and tremble when his envoy should stamp his foot and wave the imperial banner in the
halls of Parliament. From whom was this message, and to whom? Was it to the England of Trafalgar
and the Nile? Was it to the descendants of the men who conquered at Agincourt and Cressy, and
changed for ages at Waterloo the destiny of the world? Why, Nelson would speak from his monument,
and the Iron Duke from his equestrian statue, and forbid the degradation of their country.
But there stood the Confederate messenger, delivering the mandate of a foreign power to the
House of Commons, describing England as a crawling reptile, exalting the Government he professed
to represent, as controlling the Continent, and fearing lest the Imperial Eagle alone should
swoop down upon his prey. And such language, such sentiments! Was I in Billingsgate, that ancient
and illustrious institution, so near the House of Parliament? Why, the whole code of morals
and of international law was repudiated in a sentence, and our demagogues distanced in the
race. Did the envoy echo the voice of his master, when he announced that the American Union
must be dissolved by foreign intervention, because, if reunited, it would be too strong, and
bully the world--therefore France and England combined must strike us when we were supposed
to be weak and divided. It is not the author of such atrocious and dastard sentiments that
would lead the banner of France or of England anywhere except to humiliation and disgrace.
'Non talis auxilii, nec defensoribus ipsis.' No, when England seeks leaders, it will not be
the sycophants of power, those who worship alternately democracy and autocracy, who slaver
over despotism one day with their venom, and the next with their still more loathsome adulation.

But there was a change. The Ministry, and one of an order supposed to be our most deadly foes,
spoke. There were some opinions as to the results in which no American could concur--there
was deep devotion to England--but there was also the voice of reason, of justice, of international
law: it was not so cosmopolitan as I expected, but the argument of felon force and robber violence
was discarded. The scholar, the statesman, the gentleman, the philanthropist addressed the
English Commons. Yes, and the nobility of nature also spoke, one who could rise above the reputed
prejudices of his order, and do justice to a kindred race of simple republicans, though they
may know neither diadems nor coronets. Such examples exalt and dignify the character of man.
They teach us republicans a useful lesson--that those who differ from us as to some of the
forms of government, may most sincerely support that system which in their judgment will best
promote the welfare and happiness of the people. That indeed is the only question. Let England
and America work out the problem in peaceful and friendly rivalry. Time and experience will
decide the question. If, when slavery is extinguished in our Union, and the only aggressive
element of our system is extirpated, we should run a grand and peaceful career of honor and
glory and prosperity, we will want no other argument than the results. The blasphemous doctrine
of the divine rights of kings was discarded by England in the revolution of 1688. The British
throne reposes now on the alleged basis of the welfare and happiness of the people. What form
of government will best promote that end--this is the only question. I believe it is ours--but
only with slavery extinguished, and universal education--schools--schools--SCHOOLS--common
schools--high schools for all. Education the criterion of the right of suffrage, not property.
I do not believe in a government of ignorance, whether by the many or the few. With the constant
and terrible opposing element of slavery, we have certainly achieved stupendous results in
three fourths of a century, and to say that our system has failed, because slavery now makes
war upon it, is amazing folly. Why predict, that, when reunited, and with slavery extinguished,
we would bully the world. Who were our bullies? Who struck down Charles Sumner, the Senator
of Massachusetts, the eminent scholar and orator, on the floor of the Senate, for denouncing
the horrors of slavery? A South Carolinian, whilst all slavedom approved the deed. Who endeavored
to force slavery on Kansas by murder and rapine, and the forgery of a constitution? Who repealed
the Missouri Compromise, in order to force slavery upon all the Territories of the United States?
Who are endeavoring now to dissolve the Union, and spread slavery over all this wide domain?
There is a plain answer to all these questions. It is the lords of the whip and the chain and
the branding iron, who are our bullies--who insist upon forced labor, and repudiate all compensation
to the toiling millions of slaves--who repudiate, among slaves, the marital and parental relation,
and class them by law as chattels--who forbid emancipation--who make it a crime to teach slaves
to read or write--ay, even the Bible--who keep open the interstate slave-trade (more horrible
than the African, making Virginia a human stock farm), tearing husband from wife, and parents
from children--founding a government boldly announcing the doctrine of property in man, based
avowedly on the divinity, extension, and perpetuity of slavery--these are our bullies; and
when they are overthrown, we shall commence a new career of peaceful progress and advanced
civilization. And why sow the seeds of international hatred between England and America? Is
war really desired between the two countries, or is it supposed that we will yield to foreign
intervention without a struggle? No, the North will rise up as one man, and thousands even
from the South will join them. The country will become a camp, and the ocean will swarm with
our privateers. Rather than submit to dismemberment or secession, which is anarchy and ruin,
we will, we must fight, until the last man has fallen. The Almighty can never prosper such
a war upon us. If the views of a foreign power have been truly represented in Parliament, and
such an aggression upon us is contemplated, let him beware, for in such a contest, the political
pyramid resting upon its apex, the power of one man, is much more likely to fall, than that
which reposes on the broad basis of the will of the people.

Returning from this episode, I resume the narrative.

We have seen the repudiating Executive message and repudiating legislative resolutions of January,
1842, and their failure to influence the decision of the court. And now, we approach another
act in the drama. The court having affirmed the constitutionality of the Union Bank bonds,
and as the act of 1833 directed their payment, the Legislature of 1844 enacted a new law, in
these words: 'That hereafter, no judgment or decree of any court of law or equity having jurisdiction
of suits against the State, shall be paid by warrants on the Treasurer, or otherwise, without
an appropriation by law, any former law or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.' The 'law
and usage' were plain, to pay such decrees, as required by the law and Constitution; but both
were disregarded, and the act of 1833, for all practical purposes, repealed. It remained in
part, on the statute book, only to invite to the gambler's game of 'odd I win, even you lose'--that
is, if, under the act of 1833, there should be a decision in any case in favor of the State,
it should be conclusive, but if against the State, the money should not be paid, where (as
in the case of these bonds) the Legislature differed from the court, and had already repudiated
its decision. Such was the action of the Legislature in 1842 and 1844. In 1842, it repudiated,
in advance, the decision of the court on these bonds, and, after that decision, repealed so
much of the law as required the payment of the decrees of the court. Now, who would have supposed,
that more than five years before the date of Mr. Davis's letters, the highest judicial tribunal
of the State, the one designated by the law and the Constitution, had already unanimously decided
that these bonds were valid, and that the State Legislature, instead of paying the money, had
repealed the appropriation. But there came a new court, all chosen by the people, under the
wretched system, in many of the States, of an elective judiciary, but unknown to the independent
Federal judicial system. A suit was brought in 1851, under the act of 1833, on one of the Union
Bank State bonds and coupons before the Chancellor. After elaborate argument, the Chancellor
decided against the State, and entered a decree for the payment of the money. The State, as
authorized by the law, appealed from this decision to its own High Court of Errors and Appeals,
elected by the people.

Surely, it was supposed, that this new court, so recently chosen by the people, after the legislative
repudiation, would be governed by 'a proper regard for the public interest and public opinion.'
Before the Chancellor, as well as the High Court, all the objections made by Governor McNutt
and Senator Davis were earnestly pressed by the Attorney-General of the State and associate
counsel, but in vain; the decision of the Chancellor was against the State, and it was unanimously
affirmed by the High Court. This case will be found reported by the State reporter, Johnson
v. The State, April term, 1853. (3 Cushman, 625 to 882,--257 pages.)

In this case, the bond sued on is given in the record, and will be found an exact copy of that
(heretofore quoted) under the original act, which had passed two successive Legislatures, the
principal as well as coupons being payable in Federal currency.

On the reverse side of the bond is the following:

     '£450 sterling. The President, Directors, and Co. of the
     Mississippi Union Bank, do hereby designate the agency of the
     Bank of the United States in London, as the place of payment of
     the within bond and interest, and hereby assign and transfer
     the same for value received to the bearer, principal equal to
     £450 sterling, and guarantee the payment of the same at the
     place designated.

                                 'S. GWIN, Cashier.

                                 'H. G. RUNNELLS, President.

     'Mississippi State Bond, No. 91. 'Redeemable February 25th,
     1850.'

As to the place where the bond was made payable, there could be no objection, for the original,
as well as the supplemental act, gave full authority to make the bonds payable abroad. But
as to the objection that they were said to be payable in sterling, at the rate of four shillings
and sixpence to the pound, the answer was, as shown: 1st. That this was the true rate of exchange.
2d. That the bond was payable in Federal currency, and this was all the bondholder ever asked
from the State. As to the allegation that the bonds were sold below par, the court showed most
conclusively from the facts and agreed case, that they were sold above par, and their constitutionality
was fully affirmed.

The argument of the Attorney-General (Glenn) for the State, embraced 32 printed pages; in addition
to which was an elaborate argument by his associate, Mr. Stearns. The opinion of Chief Justice
Smith embraced 45 pages, the concurring opinion of Justice Yerger, 27 pages, and Justice Fisher
concurred. The State was not satisfied, but moved for a reargument, that of Wharton for the
State, embracing 54 pages, and that of Mays, on the same side, 32 pages; but the court adhered
to their decision, and unanimously affirmed the decree of the Chancellor against the State.
The decision of the court, in the heading of the case, is thus given by the reporter.

     'The bonds might have been legally issued to the bank, by the
     Governor, on the 5th June, 1838, pursuant to the provision of
     the original charter of the bank, and the faith of the State
     pledged for the purpose of raising the capital.' 'The
     supplement was not void in consequence of not having been
     passed in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution
     contained in the 7th article, 9th section of that instrument.'
     'The object of the original pledge of the faith of the State,
     was not changed by the supplemental charter, but it was passed
     in aid of the original charter.' 'Campbell v. Union Bank (6
     Howard 625) cited and confirmed.' 'The liability of the
     State, under the operation of the charter of the bank, attached
     so soon or whenever the bonds were legally executed to the
     bank, and the execution of the mortgages was neither a
     condition precedent to the pledge of the faith of the State,
     nor the condition on which the State bonds were to be executed
     and delivered.' 'It does not appear from the facts that the
     bonds were sold for less than their par value. Held that the
     sale was neither illegal nor void.' 'If the commissioners in
     the sale of the bonds received 'sterling money of Great
     Britain' at the rate of four shillings and sixpence to the
     pound, that is not such an act on their part as would avoid the
     bonds.'

Here, then, the whole case was again fully decided in 1853, by the very tribunal to which Jefferson
Davis, in 1849, invited the bondholders. And did he or the State then yield or pay the obligations.
Not at all, but they adhered to the repudiation of these bonds, disregarded and defied the
decision of the court, and have never paid one dollar of principal or interest, and never will,
so long as slavery exists in Mississippi. But it is of some moment, at least to the unfortunate
bondholders, that the minister of Jefferson Davis at Paris, avers now that these bonds are
unconstitutional.

In the case, also, of another slaveholding State, I will prove, from the public documents,
that Jefferson Davis volunteered to sustain her in the repudiation of her State bonds, in a
case more atrocious, if possible, than that of Mississippi. As Jefferson Davis is now at the
head of a slaveholding conspiracy, endeavoring to destroy the Government of my country, and
is now also engaged in selling worthless Confederate bonds in this market, I have deemed it
my duty to make this publication.

                                                    R. J. WALKER.

NOTE.--Since this was written, the supposed menacing message from the Continent has been officially
contradicted. Surely, however, I had a right to conclude, after such solemn assurances from
a member to the House, that, although acting in the character of a Confederate messenger, and
avowing such atrocious sentiments, he at least spoke the truth on that point.

                                                    R. J. W.

EVERGREEN BEAUTY.

Perhaps if my early home had stood upon an island of evergreens, or if I had dreamed my first
bright dreams among pine hills and cliffs of laurel, I should have loved their changeless beauty
less. But through all my early years I saw but little of our native evergreens, and none of
cultured, save a stunted cedar, that grew, or, rather, refused to grow, in our front yard at
home; and thus they have ever attracted me exceedingly--the charm of rarity and novelty being
added for me to their exceeding beauty.

And yet, if brought up among them, I might but have loved them more. For all I know of philosophy,
if I had been earlier familiar with shrubs, hedges, groups, cedared cliffs, and tall forests
of evergreens, they might have brought me still nobler conceptions, a more exquisite sense
of beauty, than they now do.

Be that as it may, two years 'among the pines' of Virginia and her piny mountains, have enriched
my mind with rare pictures of scenic beauty that shall keep fresh and green in memory while
memory endures! I am no botanist, I have made no studies of the evergreens, nor shall I attempt
to write of them as scholar or critic, but only as a fascinated observer. I neither care to
know or tell whether the shrubs and trees in my evergreen pictures are angiosperms or gymnosperms;
we have no 'transportation' for text books for students! During these two years, however, I
have been charmed with a thousand views of landscape scenery, embracing every form, hue, and
combination of our lovely native evergreens, whether on mountain, hill, or plain. I have seen
them along winding streams, with backgrounds of bold, rocky bluffs; sweeping across undulating
plains; rising with the uplifting mountains; peering into and over romantic mountain gorges;
and growing up through the interstices of bowldered cascades. Or, standing on the mountain
peaks, I have seen them sweep away into the vastness and grandeur of mighty, varied, and almost
boundless expanse. These are but parts of my evergreen pictures. I have looked upon a simple
holly bush when the wind of winter was upon it, scattering in lovely fragments its pure white
robe of snow, revealing the gleaming of the rich green leaves, and the half-hidden clusters
of the carmine berries. Three distinct colors thrown carelessly together, but no want of harmony--only
pure and exquisite beauty!

In the summer months our evergreens are greatly less noticeable. They are overshadowed and
eclipsed by the rich and exuberant foliage of our common but noble forest trees; but their
beauty is not, even then, lost. They give variety of hues to the forests which they fringe
or help to form; variety of shapes, and always exquisite, spicy, and healthful odors. But when
the autumn comes, with its infinitely varied tintings of orange and vermilion; when the frost
works its wonders, and the wooded hills are clothed with splendor--then the rich groups of
our native evergreens rise in their immortality of freshness. How exquisitely their bright
unfading green sets off and contrasts with the rich golds, glowing scarlets, russet browns,
purples, and crimsons, in all their delicate shades and evanescent hues! The forest leaves
grow sere and fall from their stems, sailing down singly or in groups, like bevies of frightened
birds, until the hickory, oak, maple, and elm stand uncrowned, disrobed, lifting their bare
arms to the winter skies; then higher and ever higher rises, as the gloom of winter deepens,
the glory of evergreen shrub and tree.

The fields are dull russet, the forests are black, each tree seems a skeleton; all nature,
save the evergreen, looks dead. But our mountains of firs, our hills of pine, our groves of
cedar, our thickets of holly, our cliffs crowned with laurel, full of life, and covered with
unchangeable verdure, keep eternally fresh and beautiful. Then come the great white silent
snowflakes, sailing round and falling gently down, alighting on trunk, branch, and leaf, and
covering and draping the hills, until they are pure and fair as the hills of Beulah. There
is a dreamlike beauty in an evergreen forest mantled with snow. What words could tell the purity
of coloring, the gracefulness of form of the pine boughs bending under their white burden of
feathery crystals? Especially is this true of the young and pliant trees in hedgerows and thickets,
and such as are everywhere springing up over the waste and wornout lands of Virginia.

The old monarch pine stands out like a sculptured column of ebony against the blue sky. Its
umbel top, crowned with white, makes a fitting capital for a shaft so noble. It is a picture,
in and of itself. The shrubs and young trees, so rich in leaves and verdure, so pliant to the
lines and curves of grace, when happily and picturesquely grouped, are almost bewilderingly
beautiful. Yet perhaps that which contains in itself the greatest number of the elements of
beauty, is the medium-sized pyramidal tree, be it of spruce, Norway pine, or balsam fir. It
unites at once, in its pyramidal shape, the strength and majesty of the old, and in its gracefully
curved limbs and abundant leaves, the beauty and freshness of the young tree. When loaded down
with a spotless burden of snow until its limbs are almost ready to break, no pyramid of art,
no monument chiselled by human hands, can hope to approach its pure and model beauty.

The evergreen itself, however, seems to know no season but spring. In none other does it appear
to change, and even then it casts not off the old--it only puts on the new in tenderer and
fresher beauty! The new growth of the spruce and fir, the pale yellowish-green tips set in
the dark old background, are exquisitely lovely; nor are the light green shoots of the white,
yellow, and pitch pine much, less beautiful.

Later comes the glory of the laurel bloom, the most beautiful woodflower in our climate. As
the other trees put on their leaves successively, the tinting of light, dark, and yellowish
green are infinitely varied and pleasing.

Nor must I pass over, in my picture of evergreen, the mosses and ferns of the mountains of
Virginia. More fragile than the trees and shrubs, they cannot be considered less beautiful.
Indeed, the mosses of Cheat Mountain are the most luxuriant, exquisite, delicate, and richly
beautiful things in nature. No dream of fairyland could, to my imagination, be lovelier than
are the evergreen heights of these mountains, covered, matted, fringed, heaped, piled as they
are with the greatest variety of mosses of the most delicate texture, feathery forms, and wondrously
beautiful combinations. No one who has not seen them can have any just conception of mountain
mosses, nor of the marvellous luxuriance of beauty with which they clothe rock, and tree, and
earth, and everything upon these lone wild slopes and summits. Over the rocks, amid the mosses,
hang the long pendent ferns, in richer, darker green. And with the grand old pine and fir trees
lifting their heads to the heavens, and the thick tanglewood of shrub and underbrush, there
is grandeur, grace, and beauty in bewildering, changeful, and ravishing confusion.

How I have loved, in leisure hours, to turn aside from the stern duties of the field, or the
dull monotony of the camp, to gallop under the great pines, or wind through pathless thickets
and native parks of evergreen, feasting my very soul on their eternal freshness and glory!
How I have loved to see 'Black Hawk' crush with his feet, and sink up to his fetlocks, in the
tender and fairy-like mosses that drape the mountains! How I have delighted to weave the trailing
evergreens into wreaths, trellises, and bowers in front of my white tent! And, alas! with hushed
and solemn pride, I have planted the holly and the pine on the graves of my dead comrades,
hoping they might live in all their wondrous beauty over the quiet mound, and keep green the
memory of the brave forever!

DYING IN THE HOSPITAL.

    I am dying, mother, dying, in the hospital alone;
    With a hundred faces round me, not a single one is known;
    And the human heart within me, like a fluttering, wounded dove,
    Hungers with a ceaseless yearning for one answering word of love.

    Oh, 'tis hard, 'tis hard, my mother, thus to linger day by day,
    Dying here, without the music of the battle's fierce array;--
    Dying, far from home and kindred, robbed of all life's dearest ties,
    With the eager eyes out-gazing but to meet with stranger eyes.

    It were sweet to fall, my mother, with the battle raging round,
    And to leap from earth to heaven at a single patriot-bound;
    It were sweet to feel that glory would check the tears of woe--
    That o'er hearts whose griefs were deepest a gush of pride would flow.

    But to lie at night, dear mother, and to list the warder's tread,
    As it falls upon my heart, I seem a prisoner with the dead;
    And I long to lose my sense of pain, to find a calm release,
    And to sink each vain, vain longing, in a silent sea of peace.

    Oh, could I see, dear mother, the dog that guards our door,
    It would make each life throb at my heart beat quicker than before;
    And the nursing of your own dear hands, the breath of our old hills,
    Would send a flood of fresh life back through all these draining rills.

    But it may not be, loved mother: I must die here, all alone;
    Where, a hundred faces round me, not a single one is known;
    With the human heart within me hungering, like a wounded dove,
    For the soft glance of my mother, and her dear home-words of love.

    Oh, the heart of man, loved mother, is as dauntless as a rock
    In a time of mortal danger--in the battle's deadly shock;
    But alone--alone and dying, how he craves affection's ties--
    Craves a woman's strength in weakness, and the lovelight in her eyes!

    Oh, the dreams, the dreams, my mother, that have vanished from my sky,
    Like the misty mountain vapors that before the sunlight fly--
    All the golden dreams of glory, with their rainbow tints of fame,
    That would link with deeds of valor my bright, my deathless name!

    Where are they now, dear mother? Like a mirage of the plain,
    Like a bubble on the ocean, like a jewel on the main,
    Like the sweetest flowers of autumn, when they feel the biting frost,
    All those glorious aspirations--they are lost, forever lost!

    Yet if I could live, my mother, I know I still should go
    And help to rid our country of her fratricidal foe;
    For you have taught me, long ago, that he was no true man
    Who would not, in a time like this, step forward with the van.

    And though I leave, my mother, no laurel crown of fame,
    There is not linked with my past life a single breath of shame;
    And though I ne'er shall see your face, I will no more complain,
    For I know that not a sparrow falleth to the ground in vain.

    But another dawn, sweet mother, is breaking o'er me now;
    When to-morrow's sunlight beameth, it will find a calm, cold brow;
    And another rough, rude coffin will be taken from the door:
    God bless you, dearest mother, and good-by forevermore!

LITERARY NOTICES. By DIO LEWIS, M. D. Profusely illustrated. Ticknor &
     Fields, Boston, 1863.

Diet, air, sunshine, dress, exercise, and water, are all indispensable hygienic agents, but
considerable knowledge and experience are necessary for their proper adaptation to particular
cases. Dr. Lewis's work is designed (to a certain degree) to impart such knowledge, and, while
the general rules he gives cannot fail to be useful to all, we doubt not there are many instances
of the especial malady under consideration in which the proposed mode of treatment would prove
entirely efficacious. The numerous and carefully elaborated illustrations contained in the
book render the application of the text simple and easy. The feature which especially pleases
us is, that arrangements are made for home treatment, for, if there is anything depressing
to the human spirit, it is an association of invalids. We do not mean a regular hospital, where
people are suffering from acute forms of disease, and are learning and teaching the grand lessons
of patience, endurance, and fortitude so necessary to humanity, but a community of individuals,
able to walk about, talk to one another, and be generally engrossed with one idea, the pursuit
of health. We once spent thirty days in a water-cure establishment, and can truly say that
it was one of the most miserable months we ever passed. The totally physical atmosphere, the
selfish, material countenances surrounding us, weighed upon our spirit until our nerves gave
way, and we wondered which were on the broad road to insanity, our companions or ourselves.
We examined narrowly, and found (in the generality of cases) that the angels within the bodies
of those men and women had had their wings cut away until nothing remained but the senses and
the limited knowledge they are capable of conveying.

Our experience may have been peculiarly unfortunate, but it has rendered us always happy to
welcome a rational treatment of disease that may be pursued at home. Self-denial and activity
are the two principal lessons inculcated in the work; and if we be careful to lift them from
the body to the soul, we need not fear the slight tinge of materialism that seems almost inseparable
from essays on bodily health. We repeat that Dr. Lewis's book abounds in excellent suggestions,
essential to all, and its wide circulation will doubtless tend to the improvement of the general
health of our people. Those even who, in some points, fail to agree with the author, must acknowledge
the usefulness and practicability of the general ideas advanced, together with the simplicity
of their application.

     LIFE OF CHOPIN, by F. LISZT. Translated from the French by
     MARTHA WALKER COOK. 12mo, pp. 202. Philadelphia: F. Leypoldt.
     New York: F. W. Christern and James Miller. 2d Edition.

We are glad to see that this little work has already gone into its second edition. It gives
evidence that, in spite of our domestic afflictions, more interest is felt in this country
for art, than is generally believed to be the case, even by the most astute publishers among
us. In calling the attention of our readers to this second edition of Liszt's 'Chopin,' we
do not think we can do better than place before them the following extracts from a critique
which appeared in the New York Daily Tribune of June 11th, 1863.

'The lovers of musical art may justly be congratulated on the appearance of this extraordinary
biographical study in an appropriate English dress. It is the enthusiastic tribute of a man
of noble genius to a kindred spirit, whose mastership he acknowledged, and with whom he cherished
a deep and tender friendship, beyond the vitiating touch of personal or artistic rivalry. The
volume, indeed, affords a no less admirable illustration of the impulsive, generous, unworldly
character of the author, than of the rare and wonderful gifts of its unique subject. It is
the product of the heart rather than the head, and its frequent passages of childlike naïveté,
its transparent revelations of the inmost soul of the writer, and the radiant atmosphere of
spiritual beauty in which thoughts and images are melted together with a magic spell, transport
it from the sphere of prose composition to that of high poetry. In spite of the trammels of
words, it gives expression to the same subtle and ethereal conceptions which inspired the genius
of Liszt as a musical artist. As a sketch of the life of the great composer, it possesses an
interest with which few biographical works can compare; but no details of incident could imprison
the soul of the author; and a fine æsthetic aroma breathes from every page, fragrant with the
blossoming out of a rich, original nature, as well as with an exquisite sense of art.

'Chopin was born in Poland, near Warsaw, in the year 1810. His boyhood was marked by no events
that gave promise of the greatness of his future career. He early became the victim of ill
health, which was almost the perpetual torment of his after life. He grew up in simple and
quiet habits, surrounded by the purest influences, conversant with bright examples of piety,
modesty, and integrity, which gave to his imagination 'the velvety tenderness that characterizes
the plants which have never been exposed to the dust of the beaten highways.' Commencing the
study of music when he was but nine years old, he was soon after confided to a passionate disciple
of Sebastian Bach, who for many years directed his studies in accordance with the prevailing
classic models. Through the liberality of a distinguished patron of art, Prince Radziwill,
he was placed in one of the first colleges in Warsaw, where he received a finished education
in every branch of learning. The following picture, although partaking of the nature of a fancy
piece, is introduced by Liszt, from the pen of one of the greatest living writers of fiction,
as a just representation of the youthful artist at this period of his life. For this purpose
he visited many of the German cities, and was absent from Warsaw on one of his excursions when
the revolution broke out in the autumn of 1830. He was thus forced to remain in Vienna, and
was heard there in some concerts, but failed to receive the appreciation from the artistic
public of that city which he had a right to anticipate. Leaving Vienna, he repaired to Paris,
which was henceforth to be the scene of his brilliant triumphs. His constitution, being frail
and delicate, could not long sustain the rude shocks of life unscathed, and we accordingly
find Chopin at the age of thirty with rapidly declining health; and for the next decade, his
existence was only a continued succession of the alternations of disease. The elevated, almost
aerial conceptions of Liszt, often seeming as if they disdained the bonds of language, are
presented in lucid, idiomatic English, which derives a certain vital force more from warmth
of sympathy with the original than from the use of any of the arts of vigorous expression.'

     ROCKFORD; or, Sunshine and Storm. By Mrs. LILLIE DEVEREUX
     UMSTED. Author of Southwold. Carleton, publisher, 413 Broadway,
     New York.

A novel of considerable ability. The characters are well drawn, and the moral unexceptionable.
The scenes occur in fashionable life; the descriptions are vivid, the conversations (in which
it abounds) are easy and sparkling, and the pictures of social life varied and interesting.

     GOOD THOUGHTS IN BAD TIMES, AND OTHER PAPERS. By THOMAS FULLER,
     D. D. Price, $1.50. Ticknor & Fields, Boston.

Coleridge says of Fuller: 'Next to Shakespeare, I am not certain whether he, beyond all other
writers, does not excite in me the sense and emotion of the marvellous.'

Thomas Fuller was born in 1608, was a chaplain in the army during the great civil war in England,
and died in 1661, so that much of his fifty-four years of life was spent among no very peaceful
scenes. He followed the army with a loyal heart and courageous spirit, and wrought earnestly
to mitigate the violence of hostile parties. One of the wisest and wittiest divines who have
ever ascended the pulpit, he has left behind him a fame second to none who have labored to
elevate and make their fellow creatures better. 'Untiring humor seemed the ruling passion of
his soul. With a heart open to all innocent pleasures, purged from the leaven of malice and
uncharitableness, it was as natural that he should be full of mirth as it is for the grasshopper
to chirp or bee to hum, or the birds to warble in the spring breeze and bright sunshine.'

His good thoughts are clothed in pure and beautiful language, are wise, quaint, genial, and
witty. Being collected and matured during his marches and countermarches through the country
at the time of the great civil war, we look upon their present publication as very timely and
judicious, considering the disturbed state of our own suffering country.

     THE GENTLEMAN. By GEORGE H. CALVERT. Ticknor & Fields. Boston.
     Price, 75 cts.

A book which we hope will have a wide circulation, and exercise a beneficial influence in this
country. It is no superficial essay on external matters of etiquette, or even of mere æsthetic
culture: it goes to the very heart of the meaning of the abused word, Gentleman, and proves
its root to be unselfishness. The author says: 'It is the moral element which, in my conception
of the gentleman, is pivotal. Dealing with the highest type, I conceive that in that type not
only are morals primary, but that manners result from them; so that where there is not a solid
substratum of pure, elevated feeling there cannot be a clean, high, and unaffected demeanor.'
'The true gentleman is a Christian product.

These views are illustrated with genius and scholarship. Their dissemination among ourselves
is especially important, because our ideas of what is requisite to form a gentleman are essentially
vague, crude, unformed, and often false.

It is no dull book of commonplace thoughts, but a high and noble essay on an important subject,
and we commend it to the attention of our readers. Let him who would look upon the reverse
of the gentleman, turn to the Editor's Table of the July issue of THE CONTINENTAL, and regard
the repulsive sketch of the 'Southern Colonel,' whose ideal seems to be 'Brandy Smash and Cocktails.'
Alas! that such ideals too frequently occur among ourselves. Bayard and Sir Philip Sydney are
valuable studies for our own young and gallant soldiers.

     POINT OF HONOR. By the Author of the 'Morals of May Fair,'
     'Creeds,' &c., &c. Harper & Brothers, publishers, Franklin
     Square, New York.

This is no sensational tale. Its interest is not derived from intricacy of plot or mysterious
developments; it presents us with admirable studies of male and female character, the traits
of which are manifested in the progress of the plot. The portraits are detailed, natural, and
living; the heroine feminine and lovely. The moral is good, and the 'Point of Honor' ably displayed.

     SCIENCE FOR THE SCHOOL AND FAMILY. Part I. Natural Philosophy. Harper & Brothers,
     publishers, Franklin Square, New York.

A valuable offering to teachers and pupils.

Professor Hooker has published a graduated series of books, carefully adapted to the different
periods of the course of study; exceedingly simple for the beginner, stepping carefully from
the known to the unknown, and widening their range with the increasing knowledge and mental
growth of the student. The first in the graduated series is the 'Child's Book of Common Things.'
Next, the 'Child's Book of Nature,' in three Parts, viz.: 'Plants,' 'Animals,' 'Air, Water,
Light, Heat,'--then follow the 'First Book in Chemistry' and 'First Book in Physiology.' The
next step in the gradation brings us to three books under one title: 'Science for the School
and the Family;' Part I, Natural Philosophy; Part II, Chemistry; Part III, Mineralogy and Geology.

Our author says: 'One grand essential for giving interest to any study is the presentation
of the various points in the natural order in which they should enter the mind. They should
be so presented that each portion of a book shall make the following portions more interesting
and more easily understood. This principle I have endeavored to observe strictly in the preparation
of my volumes.' We believe Professor Hooker has succeeded in the observation of this principle,
and that its observation must insure success.

     THE STORY OF THE GUARD: A Chronicle of the War. By JESSIE
     BENTON FREMONT. Knapsack Edition. Price, 50 cts. Ticknor &
     Fields, Boston.

We are glad to see this little work of affection and patriotism from the hand of a gifted lady
(who says: 'For any personal object I should never use my name, which has been to me a double
charge to keep; but I think my father would more than approve, when it is to do justice, and
to aid the widow and the orphan') already passed into the sixth edition.

'To do justice to brave men and to aid the widow and orphan!' What nobler motive could there
be for publishing a book, than the prevailing one so simply given by Mrs. Fremont in the lines
just quoted! Truly the most determined hater of the so much read and so much abused 'women's
books,' must cease to sneer in acknowledging that here indeed was inducement sufficient to
make the most timid and shrinking of the sex face the frowns of the critic, the scoff of the
antagonistic politician, and the astonishment of the fashionable world that one who had long
been one of its most brilliant ornaments should condescend to become known as an authoress!
We heartily congratulate her on the success of her book, which, as achieving its object, must
be dear to her heart. Very charming, too, are the extracts given from General Fremont's letters.
Domestic love and peace are surely holy!
