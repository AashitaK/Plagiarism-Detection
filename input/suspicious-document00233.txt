PREFACE.

The following chapters are devoted mainly to facts and incidents connected with the development
of anti-slavery politics from the year 1840 to the close of the work of Reconstruction which
followed the late civil war.  Other topics, however, are occasionally noticed, while I have
deemed it proper to state my own attitude and course of action respecting various public questions,
and to refer more particularly to the political strifes of my own State.  In doing this, I
have spoken freely of conspicuous personalities in connection with their public action, or
their peculiar relations to myself; but my aim has been to deal fairly and state only the truth,
while striving to weave into my story some reminiscences of the men and events of by-gone times,
which may interest the reader.  In the endeavor to elucidate the orderly progress of anti-slavery
opinions and their translation into organized action, I have summarized and re-stated many
of the familiar facts of current American politics during the period embraced; but I hope I
have also made a slight contribution to the sources of history bearing upon a world-famous
movement, touching which we should "gather up the fragments that nothing be lost."

INDEX

POLITICAL RECOLLECTIONS.

Through the influence of early associations, I began my political life as a Whig, casting my
first presidential ballot for General Harrison, in 1840.  I knew next to nothing of our party
politics; but in the matter of attending mass-meetings, singing Whig songs and drinking hard
cider, I played a considerable part in the memorable campaign of that year.  So far as ideas
entered into my support of the Whig candidate, I simply regarded him as a poor man, whose home
was a log cabin, and who would in some way help the people through their scuffle with poverty
and the "hard times"; while I was fully persuaded that Van Buren was not only a graceless aristocrat
and a dandy, but a cunning conspirator, seeking the overthrow of his country's liberties by
uniting the sword and the purse in his own clutches, as he was often painted on the party banners.
In these impressions I was by no means singular.  They filled the air, and seemed to be wafted
on every breeze.  Horace Greeley's famous campaign organ, "The Log Cabin," only gave them voice
and fitting pictorial effect, and he frankly admitted in later years that his Whig appeals,
with his music and wood engravings of General Harrison's battle scenes, were more "vivid" than
"sedately argumentative."  No one will now seriously pretend that this was a campaign of ideas,
or a struggle for political reform in any sense.  It was a grand national frolic, in which
the imprisoned mirth and fun of the people found such jubilant and uproarious expression that
anything like calmness of judgment or real seriousness of purpose was out of the question in
the Whig camp.

As regards party issues, General Harrison, singularly enough, was not a Whig, but an old fashioned
States-Rights Democrat of the Jeffersonian school.  His letters to Harmar Denny and Sherrod
Williams committed him to none of the dogmas which defined a Whig. No authentic utterance of
his could be produced in which he had ever expressed his agreement with the Whig party on the
questions of a protective tariff, internal improvements, or a national bank. There was very
high Whig authority for saying that the bank question was not an issue of the canvass, while
Van Buren's great measure for separating the currency from the banks became a law pending the
Presidential struggle.  In fact, it was because no proof of General Harrison's party orthodoxy
could be found, that he was nominated; and the Whig managers of the Harrisburg Convention felt
obliged to sacrifice Henry Clay, which they did through the basest double-dealing and treachery,
for the reason that his right angled character as a party leader would make him unavailable
as a candidate. As to John Tyler, he was not a Whig in any sense.  It is true that he had opposed
the removal of the deposits, and voted against Benton's expunging resolutions, but on all the
regular and recognized party issues he was fully committed as a Democrat, and was, moreover,
a nullifier.  The sole proof of his Whiggery was the apocryphal statement that he wept when
Clay failed to receive the nomination, while his political position was perfectly understood
by the men who nominated him.  There was one policy only on which they were perfectly agreed,
and that was the policy of avowing no principles whatever; and they tendered but one issue,
and that was a change of the national administration.  On this issue they were perfectly united
and thoroughly in earnest, and it was idle to deny that on their own showing the spoils alone
divided them from the Democrats and inspired their zeal.

The demand of the Whigs for a change was well-founded.  Samuel Swartwout, the New York Collector
of Customs, had disgraced the Government by his defalcations; and, although he was a legacy
of Mr. Van Buren's "illustrious predecessor," and had been "vindicated" by a Senate committee
composed chiefly of his political opponents, he was unquestionably a public swindler, and had
found shelter under Mr. Van Buren's administration.  He was the most conspicuous public rascal
of his time, but was far from being alone in his odious notoriety.  The system of public plunder
inaugurated by Jackson was in full blast, and an organized effort to reform it was the real
need of the hour; but here was the weak point of the Whigs.  They proceeded upon the perfectly
gratuitous assumption that the shameless abuses against which they clamored would be thoroughly
reformed should they come into power.  They took it for granted that a change would be equivalent
to a cure, and that the people would follow them in thus begging the very question on which
some satisfactory assurance was reasonably required.  They seemed totally unconscious of the
fact that human nature is essentially the same in all parties, and that a mere change of men
without any change of system would be fruitless.  They laid down no programme looking to the
reform of the civil service.  They did not condemn it, and their sole panacea for the startling
frauds and defalcations of Van Buren's administration was the imagined superior virtue and
patriotism of the Whigs.  In the light of this fact alone, it is impossible to account for
the perfectly unbounded and irrepressible enthusiasm which swept over the land during the campaign,
and so signally routed the forces of Democracy.  Something more than empty promises and windy
declamation was necessary, and that something, in an evil hour, was supplied by the Democrats
themselves.

General Harrison was a man of Revolutionary blood.  He commanded the confidence of the chief
Fathers of the Republic.  He was a man of undoubted bravery, and had made a most honorable
record, both as a soldier and a civilian, upon ample trial in both capacities. He was unquestionably
honest and patriotic, and the fact that he was a poor man, and a plain farmer of the West,
could properly form no objection to his character or his fitness for the Presidency. But the
Democratic orators and newspapers assailed him as an "imbecile."  They called him a "dotard"
and a "granny."  They said he had distinguished himself in war by running away from the enemy.
One Democratic journalist spoke of him, contemptuously, as a man who should be content with
a log cabin and a barrel of hard cider, without aspiring to the Presidency.  The efforts to
belittle his merits and defile his good name became systematic, and degenerated into the most
unpardonable personal abuse and political defamation. This was exactly what the Whigs needed
to supplement their lack of principles.  It worked like a charm.  It rallied the Whig masses
like a grand battle-cry.  Mass-meetings of the people, such as had never been dreamed of before,
became the order of the day.  The people took the work of politics into their own keeping,
and the leaders became followers.  The first monster meeting I attended was held on the Tippecanoe
battle-ground, on the 29th and 30th of May.  In order to attend it I rode on horseback through
the mud and swamps one hundred and fifty miles; but I considered myself amply compensated for
the journey in what I saw and enjoyed.  The gathering was simply immense; and I remember that
James Brooks, since conspicuous in our national politics, tried to address the multitude from
the top of a huge log cabin.  Large shipments of hard cider had been sent up the Wabash by
steamer, and it was liberally dealt out to the people in gourds, as more appropriate and old-fashioned
than glasses.  The people seemed to be supremely happy, and their faces were so uniformly radiant
with smiles that a man who was detected with a serious countenance was at once suspected as
an unrepentant "Loco-foco."  But by far the largest meeting of the campaign was that held at
Dayton, on the 12th day of September, where General Harrison spoke at length.  He was the first
"great man" I had seen; and, while gazing into his face with an awe which I have never since
felt for any mortal, I was suddenly recalled from my rapt condition by the exit of my pocket-book.
The number in attendance at this meeting was estimated at two hundred thousand, and I think
it could not have been far out of the way.  I am sure I have never seen it equaled, although
I have witnessed many great meetings within the past forty years.  The marked peculiarity of
all the gatherings of this campaign was a certain grotesque pomp and extravagance of representation
suggestive of a grand carnival.  The banners, devices and pictures were innumerable, while
huge wagons were mounted with log cabins, cider barrels, canoes, miniature ships, and raccoons.

But the most distinguishing feature of the campaign was its music. The spirit of song was everywhere,
and made the whole land vocal. The campaign was set to music, and the song seriously threatened
to drown the stump speech.  Whiggery was translated into a tune, and poured itself forth in
doggerel rhymes which seemed to be born of the hour, and exactly suited to the crisis.  I give
a few specimens, partly from memory, and partly from "The Harrison and Log Cabin Song Book"
of 1840, a copy of which is before me:

  What has caused the great commotion, motion, motion,
  Our country through?
  It is the ball a-rolling on, on,
  For Tippecanoe and Tyler too--Tippecanoe and Tyler too;
  And with them we'll beat little Van, Van, Van;
  Van is a used up man;
  And with them we'll beat little Van.

The famous "ball" alluded to in this song originated with the Whigs of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,
and was sent by them to a Mass Convention held at Baltimore.  It was ten or twelve feet in
diameter, and upon the ends of it, on blue ground, were stars corresponding in number with
the States of the Union.  On its wide spaces of red and white stripes various inscriptions
were made, including the following, which belongs to the poetry and music of the campaign:

  With heart and soul
  This ball we roll;
  May times improve
  As on we move.

  This Democratic ball
  Set rolling first by Benton,
  Is on another track
  From that it first was sent on.

  Farewell, dear Van,
  You're not our man;
  To guide the ship,
  We'll try old Tip.

The following, sung to the tune of "Old Rosin the Bow," was quite as popular:

  Come ye who, whatever betide her,
  To Freedom have sworn to be true,
  Prime up with a cup of hard cider,
  And drink to old Tippecanoe.

  On top I've a cask of as good, sir,
  As man from the tap ever drew;
  No poison to cut up your blood, sir,
  But liquor as pure as the dew.

  Parched corn men can't stand it much longer,
  Enough is as much as we'll bear;
  With Tip at our head, in October,
  We'll tumble Van out of the chair.

  Then ho! for March fourth, forty-one, boys,
  We'll shout till the heavens' arched blue
  Shall echo hard cider and fun, boys,
  Drink, drink, to old Tippecanoe.

The following kindred verses will be familiar to everybody who remembers the year 1840:

  Ye jolly young lads of Ohio,
  And all ye sick Vanocrats, too,
  Come out from among the foul party,
  And vote for old Tippecanoe.

  Good men from the Van jacks are flying,
  Which makes them look kinder askew,
  For they see they are joining the standard
  With the hero of Tippecanoe.

  They say that he lived in a cabin,
  And lived on old cider, too;
  Well, what if he did?  I'm certain
  He's the hero of Tippecanoe.

I give the following verses of one of the best, which used to be sung with tremendous effect:

  The times are bad, and want curing;
  They are getting past all enduring;
  Let us turn out Martin Van Buren,
  And put in old Tippecanoe.
  The best thing we can do,
  Is to put in old Tippecanoe.

  It's a business we all can take part in,
  So let us give notice to Martin
  That he must get ready for sartin',
  For we'll put in old Tippecanoe.
  The best thing we can do
  Is to put in old Tippecanoe.

  We've had of their humbugs a plenty;
  For now all our pockets are empty;
  We've a dollar now where we had twenty,
  So we'll put in old Tippecanoe.
  The best thing we can do,
  Is to put in old Tippecanoe.

The following verses are perfectly characteristic:

  See the farmer to his meal
  Joyfully repair;
  Crackers, cheese and cider, too,
  A hard but homely fare.

  Martin to his breakfast comes
  At the hour of noon;
  Sipping from a china cup,
  With a golden spoon.

  Martin's steeds impatient wait
  At the palace door;
  Outriders behind the coach
  And lackeys on before.

After the State election in Maine, a new song appeared, which at once became a favorite, and
from which I quote the following:

  And have you heard the news from Maine,
  And what old Maine can do?
  She went hell bent for Governor Kent,
  And Tippecanoe and Tyler too,
  And Tippecanoe and Tyler too.

Such was this most remarkable Whig campaign, with its monster meetings and music, its infinite
drolleries, its rollicking fun, and its strong flavor of political lunacy.  As to the canvass
of the Democrats, the story is soon told.  In all points it was the reverse of a success. 
The attempt to manufacture enthusiasm failed signally.  They had neither fun nor music in their
service, and the attempt to secure them would have been completely overwhelmed by the flood
on the other side.  It was a melancholy struggle, and constantly made more so by the provoking
enthusiasm and unbounded good humor of the Whigs.  It ended as a campaign of despair, while
its humiliating catastrophe must have awakened inexpressible disappointment and disgust both
among the leaders and masses of the party.

This picture of party politics, forty-three years ago, is not very flattering to our American
pride, but it simply shows the working of Democratic institutions in dealing with the "raw
material" of society and life at that time.  The movement of 1840 was necessarily transient
and provisional, while underneath its clatter and nonsense was a real issue.  It was unrecognized
by both parties, but it made its advent, and the men who pointed its way quietly served notice
upon the country of their ulterior purposes.

As long ago as the year 1817, Charles Osborn had established an anti-slavery newspaper in Ohio,
entitled "The Philanthropist," which was followed in 1821 by the publication of Benjamin Lundy's
"Genius of Universal Emancipation."  In 1831 the uprising of slaves in Southampton County,
Virginia, under the lead of Nat. Turner, had startled the country and invited attention to
the question of slavery.  In the same year Garrison had established "The Liberator," and in
1835 was mobbed in Boston, and dragged through its streets with a rope about his neck.  In
1837 Lovejoy had been murdered in Alton, Illinois, and his assassins compared by the Mayor
of Boston to the patriots of the Revolution.  In 1838 a pro-slavery mob had set fire to Pennsylvania
Hall, in Philadelphia, and defied the city authorities in this service of slavery.  President
Jackson and Amos Kendall, his Postmaster General, had openly set the Constitution at defiance
by justifying the rifling of the mails and the suppression of the circulation of anti-slavery
newspapers in the South.  The "gag" resolutions had been introduced in the House of Representatives
in 1836, which provoked the splendid fights of Adams, Giddings and Slade for the right of petition
and the freedom of speech.  Dr. Channing had published his prophetic letter to Henry Clay,
on the annexation of Texas, in 1837, and awakened a profound interest in the slavery question
on both sides of the Atlantic.  We had been disgraced by two Florida wars, caused by the unconstitutional
espousal of slavery by the General Government.  President Van Buren had dishonored his administration
and defied the moral sense of the civilized world by his efforts to prostitute our foreign
policy to the service of slavery and the slave trade.  In February, 1839, Henry Clay had made
his famous speech on "Abolitionism," and thus recognized the bearing of the slavery question
upon the presidential election of the following year.  The Abolitionists had laid siege to
the conscience and humanity of the people, and their moral appeals were to be a well-spring
of life to the nation in its final struggle for self-preservation; but as yet they had agreed
upon no organized plan of action against the aggressions of an institution which threatened
the overthrow of the Union and the end of Republican government.  But now they were divided
into two camps, the larger of which favored political action, organized as a party, and nominated,
as its candidate for President, James G. Birney, who received nearly seven thousand votes.

This was a small beginning, but it was the beginning of the end. That slavery was to be put
down without political action in a government carried on by the ballot was never a tenable
proposition, and the inevitable work was at last inaugurated.  It was done opportunely.  Harrison
and Van Buren were alike objectionable to anti-slavery men who understood their record.  To
choose between them was to betray the cause.  Van Buren had attempted to shelter the slave
trade under the national flag.  He had allied himself to the enemies of the right of petition
and the freedom of debate, as the means of conciliating the South.  He had taken sides with
Jackson in his lawless interference with the mails at the bidding of slave-holders.  In a word,
he had fairly earned the description of "a Northern man with Southern principles."  General
Harrison, on the other hand, was a pro-slavery Virginian.  While Governor of Indiana Territory
he had repeatedly sought the introduction of slavery into that region through the suspension
of the ordnance of 1787, which had forever dedicated it to freedom.  He had taken sides with
the South in 1820 on the Missouri question.  He had no sympathy with the struggle of Adams
and his associates, against the gag and in favor of the right of petition, and regarded the
discussion of the slavery question as unconstitutional.  The first draft of his inaugural was
so wantonly offensive to the anti-slavery Whigs who had aided in his election, that even Mr.
Clay condemned it, and prevailed on the General to modify it.  He had declared that "the schemes
of the Abolitionists were fraught with horrors, upon which an incarnate devil only could look
with approbation." With such candidates the hour had fairly struck for anti-slavery men, who
believed in the use of the ballot, to launch the grand movement which was finally to triumph
over all opposition; while to oppose this movement, however honestly, was to encourage men
to choose between parties equally untrustworthy, and by thus prolonging their rule to defeat
all practical anti-slavery work.  It was the singular mistake of the non-voting Abolitionists
at this time, that, while they looked forward to political action as the ultimate result of
their moral agitation, they vehemently opposed the formation of an anti-slavery political party,
and either withheld their votes or divided them between these pro-slavery chieftains, though
giving by far the larger proportion to the Whig candidate.

From this time forward anti-slavery progress was more marked.  The struggle over the right
of petition in Congress continued, and was characterized by a constantly increasing measure
of fierceness on the part of the South.  This is vividly depicted in a passage from the diary
of Mr. Adams, in March, 1841, in which he declares that "The world, the flesh, and all the
devils in hell are arrayed against any man who now, in this North American Union, shall dare
to join the standard of Almighty God to put down the African slave trade; and what can I, upon
the verge of my seventy-fourth birthday, with a shaking hand, a darkening eye, a drowsy brain,
and with all my faculties dropping from me one by one as the teeth are dropping from my head,
what can I do for the cause of God and man, for the progress of human emancipation, for the
suppression of the African slave-trade?  Yet my conscience presses me on; let me but die upon
the breach."

The celebrated trial of Mr. Adams the following year, for presenting a petition from the citizens
of Haverhill, requesting Congress to take steps toward a peaceable dissolution of the Union,
was a great national event, and his triumph gave a new impulse to the cause of freedom.  The
censure of Mr. Giddings which followed, for offering resolutions in the House embodying the
simplest truisms respecting the relations of the General Government to slavery, and the elaborate
State paper of Mr. Webster, which provoked these resolutions, in which he attempted to commit
the Government to the protection of slavery on the high seas, in accordance with the theories
of Mr. Calhoun, still further kept alive the anti-slavery agitation, and awakened the interest
of Northern men.  A kindred aid, unwittingly rendered the anti-slavery cause, was the infamous
diplomacy of General Cass, our Ambassador to France in 1842, in connection with the Quintuple
Treaty for the suppression of the African slave trade. His monstrous effort to shield that
trade under the flag of the United States was characterized by Mr. Adams as "a compound of
Yankee cunning, of Italian perfidy, and of French légéreté, cemented by shameless profligacy
unparalleled in American diplomacy." In October, 1842, Henry Clay himself became an anti-slavery
agitator through his famous "Mendenhall Speech" at Richmond, Indiana.  In response to a petition
asking him to emancipate his slaves, he told the people "that whatever the law secures as property
is property," and described his slaves as "being well fed and clad," and as looking "sleek
and hearty."  "Go home, Mr. Mendenhall," said he, "and mind your own business, and leave other
people to take care of theirs."  Mr. Mendenhall was an anti-slavery Quaker; but Mr. Clay, while
rebuking him severely, took pains to compliment the society itself on its practically pro-slavery
attitude, and thus stung into redoubled earnestness and zeal the men who had recently been
driven out of it on account of their "abolitionism."  On the day following this speech, which
was the Sabbath, he was escorted to the yearly meeting by Elijah Coffin, its clerk, seated
in a very conspicuous place, honored by every mark of the most obsequious deference, and thus
made the instrument of widening the breach already formed in the society, while feeding the
anti-slavery fires which he was so anxious to assuage.

The work of agitation was still further kept alive by conflicts between the Northern and Southern
States respecting the reclamation of fugitives from crime.  Virginia had demanded of New York
the surrender of three colored sailors who were charged with having aided a slave to escape.
Governor Seward refused to deliver them up, for the reason that the Constitutional provision
on the subject must be so understood as that States would only be required to surrender fugitives
accused of an offense considered a crime in the State called upon to make the surrender as
well as in the State asking for it.  Similar controversies occurred between other States, in
all of which the South failed in her purpose.  The anti-slavery spirit found further expression
in 1843 in Massachusetts, whose Legislature resolved to move, through the Representatives of
the State in Congress, an Amendment to the Constitution, basing representation on the free
population only of the States; which proposition gave rise to a most memorable debate in the
national House of Representatives.  It was in the August of the same year that the voting Abolitionists
held a National Convention in Buffalo, in which all the free States, except New Hampshire,
were represented; while in the following year the Methodist Episcopal Church was rent in twain
by the same unmanageable question, which had previously divided other ecclesiastical communions.

In the meanwhile, the question of Texan annexation had been steadily advancing to the political
front, and stirring the blood of the people both North and South.  This "robbery of a realm,"
as Dr. Channing had styled it, was the unalterable purpose and unquenchable desire of the slave-holding
interest, and its accomplishment was to be secured by openly espousing the principle that the
end justifies the means, and setting all consequences at defiance. This is exactly what the
Government did.  The diplomacy through which the plot was prosecuted was marked by a cunning,
audacity, and perfidy, which, in these particulars, leave the administration of John Tyler
unrivalled in its ugly pre-eminence, and form one of the blackest pages in the history of the
Republic.  The momentous question was now upon us; and on the dawning of the year 1844, all
parties saw that it was destined to be the overshadowing issue in the ensuing presidential
campaign.

The times were serious.  The fun and frolic of 1840 had borne no fruit, and that part of our
history could not be repeated.  The campaign of 1844 promised to be a struggle for principle;
and among the Whigs all eyes were turned for a standard-bearer to Mr. Clay, who had been so
shabbily treated four years before.  He was unanimously nominated on the first of May, with
Theodore Frelinghuysen as the candidate for Vice President.  The party issues were not very
sharply defined, but this was scarcely necessary with a candidate who was proverbially regarded
as himself "the embodiment of Whig principles."  On the subject of annexation, he clearly defined
his position in his letter of the 17th of April to the "National Intelligencer."  He declared
that annexation and war with Mexico were identical, and placed himself squarely against it,
except upon conditions specified, which would make the project of immediate annexation impossible.
On the slavery question, he had not yet seriously offended the anti-slavery element in his
own party, and was even trusted by some of the voting anti-slavery men. In a speech at Raleigh,
in April of this year, he declared it to be "the duty of each State to sustain its own domestic
institutions." He had publicly said that the General Government had nothing to do with slavery,
save in the matters of taxation, representation, and the return of fugitive slaves.  He had
condemned the censure of Mr. Giddings in 1842 as an outrage, and indorsed the principles laid
down in his tract, signed "Pacificus," on the relations of the Federal Government to slavery,
and the rights and duties of the people of the free States.  In his earlier years, he had been
an outspoken emancipationist, and had always frankly expressed his opinion that slavery was
a great evil.  These considerations, and especially his unequivocal utterances against the
annexation scheme, were regarded as hopeful auguries of a thoroughly united party, and its
triumph at the polls; while Mr. Webster, always on the presidential anxious-seat, and carefully
watching the signs of the political zodiac, now cordially lent his efforts to the Whig cause.

With the Democracy, Mr. Van Buren was still a general favorite. His friends felt that the wrong
done him in 1840 should now be righted, and a large majority of his party undoubtedly favored
his renomination.  But his famous letter to Mr. Hammet, of Mississippi, dated March 27th, on
the annexation of Texas, placed a lion in his path.  In this lengthy and elaborate document
he committed himself against the project of immediate annexation, and the effect was at once
seen in the decidedly unfriendly tone of Democratic opinion in the South.  He had been faithful
to the Slave oligarchy in many things, but his failure in one was counted a breach of the whole
law.  By many acts of patient and dutiful service he had earned the gratitude of his Southern
task-masters; but now, when driven to the wall, he mustered the courage to say, "Thus far,
no farther"; and for this there was no forgiveness.  General Jackson came to his rescue, but
it was in vain.  The Southern heart was set upon immediate annexation as the golden opportunity
for rebuilding the endangered edifice of slavery, and Mr. Van Buren's talk about national obligations
and the danger of a foreign war was treated as the idle wind.  The Southern Democrats were
bent upon his overthrow, and they went about it in the Baltimore Convention of the 27th of
May as if perfectly conscious of their power over the Northern wing of the party.  They moved
and carried the "two-thirds rule," which had been acted on in the National Convention of 1832,
and afterward in that of 1835, although this could not have been done without the votes of
a majority of the convention, which was itself strongly for Van Buren.  The rule was adopted
by a considerable majority, the South being nearly unanimous in its favor, while the North
largely "supplied the men who handed Van Buren over to his enemies with a kiss."  Even General
Cass, the most gifted and accomplished dough-face in the Northern States, failed to receive
a majority of the votes of the Convention on any ballot, and James K. Polk was finally nominated
as the champion of immediate annexation, with George M. Dallas as the candidate for Vice President.

The nomination was a perfect surprise to the country, because Mr. Polk was wholly unknown to
the people as a statesman.  Like Governor Hayes, when nominated in 1876, he belonged to the
"illustrious obscure."  The astonished native who, on hearing the news, suddenly inquired of
a bystander, "Who the devil is Polk?" simply echoed the common feeling, while his question
provoked the general laughter of the Whigs.  For a time the nomination was somewhat disappointing
to the Democrats themselves; but they soon rallied, and finally went into the canvass very
earnestly, and with a united front. The Whigs began the campaign in high hopes and in fact
with unbounded confidence in their success.  Their great captain was in command, and they took
comfort in his favorite utterance that "truth is omnipotent, and public justice certain." 
To pit him against such a pigmy as Polk seemed to them a miserable burlesque, and they counted
their triumph as already perfectly assured.  They claimed the advantage on the question of
annexation, and still more as to the tariff, since the act of 1842 was popular, and Polk was
known to be a free-trader of the Calhoun school.  As the canvass proceeded, however, it became
evident that the fight was to be fierce and bitter to the last degree, and that the issue,
after all, was not so certain.  Mr. Polk, notwithstanding his obscurity, was able to rouse
the enthusiasm of his party, North and South, to a very remarkable degree.  The annexation
pill was swallowed by many Democrats whose support of him had been deemed morally impossible.
In New York, where the opposition was strongest, leading Democrats, with William Cullen Bryant
as their head, denounced the annexation scheme and repudiated the paragraph of the National
platform which favored it, and yet voted for Polk, who owed his nomination solely to the fact
that he had committed himself to the policy of immediate and unconditional annexation, thus
anticipating the sickly political morality of 1852, when so many men of repute tried in vain
to save both their consciences and their party orthodoxy by "spitting upon the platform and
swallowing the candidate who stood upon it." History will have to record that the action of
these New York Democrats saved the ticket in that State, and justly attaches to them the responsibility
for the very evils to the country against which they so eloquently warned their brethren. 
The power of the spoils came in as a tremendous make-weight, while the party lash was vigorously
flourished, and the "independent voter" was as hateful to the party managers on both sides
as we find him to-day. Those who refused to wear the party collar were branded by the "organs"
as a "pestiferous and demoralizing brood," who deserved "extermination."  Discipline was rigorously
enforced, and made to take the place of argument.  As regards the tariff question, Mr. Polk's
letter to Judge Kane, of Philadelphia, of the 19th of June, enabled his friends completely
to turn the tables on the Whigs of Pennsylvania, where "Polk, Dallas, and the tariff of 1842,"
was blazoned on the Democratic banners, and thousands of Democrats were actually made to believe
that Polk was even a better tariff man than Clay.  This letter, committing its free-trade author
to the principle of a revenue tariff, with "reasonable incidental protection to our home industries,"
was translated into German and printed in all the party papers; and as a triumphant effort
to make the people believe a lie, and a masterpiece of political duplicity employed by the
great party as a means of success, it had no precedent in American politics.  In later times,
however, it has been completely eclipsed by the scheme of "tissue ballots," and other wholesale
methods of balking the popular will in the South, by the successful effort to cheat the nation
out of the right to choose its Chief Magistrate in 1876, and by the startling bribery of a
great commonwealth four years later, now unblushingly confessed by the party leaders who accomplished
it.

In the meantime the spirit of discontent began to manifest itself among the Whigs of the South
respecting Mr. Clay's attitude on the question of annexation, and in a moment of weakness he
wrote his unfortunate "Alabama letter," of the 27th of July.  In that letter he said:  "I do
not think the subject of slavery ought to affect the question one way or the other.  Whether
Texas be independent or incorporated into the United States, I do not believe it will prolong
or shorten the duration of that institution."  These words were perfectly chilling to his anti-slavery
supporters, who were utterly opposed to annexation on any terms, because the power of slavery
would thus inevitably be extended and strengthened in the United States.  The letter was an
irreparable mistake.  It was a fresh example of his besetting tendency to mediate between opposing
policies, and undoubtedly drove from his support many who would otherwise have followed the
Whig banner to the end.

But the Whigs kept up the fight.  The issues were joined, and it was too late to change front.
The real question in dispute was that of annexation, and the election of Polk was certain to
secure it, and to involve the nation in war.  Clay was unquestionably right in saying that
annexation and war were identical; and, although on the slavery question he might be feared
as a compromiser, there was no reason to doubt that, if elected, he would vigorously resist
the annexation scheme, except upon conditions already stated, which could not fail to defeat
it as a present measure and avoid the calamities of war.  I was inexpressibly disappointed
and grieved by his letter; but I agreed with Cassius M. Clay, that opposition to annexation
except "with the common consent of the Union" was practically absolute opposition, and I therefore
kept up the fight in which I had enlisted in the beginning and made my first venture as a stump
speaker.  I cared little about the old party issues. I had outgrown the teachings of the Whigs
on the subject of protection, and especially their pet dogma of "the higher the duty the lower
the price of the protected article."  As to a national bank, I followed Webster, who had pronounced
it "an obsolete idea"; and I totally repudiated the land policy of the Whigs, having at that
early day espoused the principle that the public lands should cease to be a source of revenue,
and be granted in small homesteads to the landless poor for actual settlement and tillage.
But on the subject of slavery, though it had escaped my attention in the hurrah of 1840, I
was thoroughly aroused.  This came of my Quaker training, the speeches of Adams and Giddings,
the anti-slavery newspapers, and the writings of Dr. Channing, all of which I had been reading
with profound interest since the Harrison Campaign. Being perfectly sure that annexation would
lead to slavery-extension and war, I thought it my clear and unhesitating duty to resist the
election of Polk with all my might.  This I did to the end, and in doing it I employed substantially
the same arguments on which I justified my separation from the Whigs four years later.

The contest proceeded with its variety of charges and counter- charges, and was prosecuted
on both sides with extraordinary vigor and zeal in every part of the Union.  I think it was
everywhere and pre-eminently a struggle between the men of brains on either side.  I am quite
sure this was true in my own State.  Indiana was remarkable at that time, not only for her
gifted stump orators, but for her men of real calibre and power of argument.  On the side of
the Whigs were such men as Oliver H. Smith, Joseph G. Marshall, George G. Dunn, Joseph L. White,
Richard W. Thompson, Caleb B. Smith, George H. Proffit, Henry S. Lane, Samuel W. Parker, and
James H. Cravens.  The Democrats could boast of Tilghman A. Howard, James Whitcomb, Edward
A. Hannegan, William W. Wick, John Law, Joseph A. Wright, Jesse D. Bright, John W. Davis, Thomas
J. Henly, and John L. Robinson.  The best talking talent of the nation was called into service,
including such Democratic giants as Thomas H. Benton, William Allen, Silas Wright, Robert J.
Walker, James Buchanan, and Daniel S. Dickinson; and such Whigs to match them as Daniel Webster,
Rufus Choate, Thomas F. Marshall, Thomas Corwin, S. S. Prentiss, Thomas Ewing, and W. C. Preston.
The fight was more ably if not more hotly contested than any preceding national struggle, raging
and blazing everywhere, while the forces marshaled against each other were more evenly balanced
than in any contest since the year 1800.  The race was so close that the result hung in agonizing
doubt and suspense up to the evening following the election.  Party feeling rose to a frenzy,
and the consuming desire of the Whigs to crown their great Chief with the laurels of victory
was only equaled by that of the Democrats for the triumph of the unknown Tennessean whose nomination
had provoked the aggravating laughter of the enemy in the beginning.

It is not possible to describe the effect of Mr. Clay's defeat upon the Whigs.  It was wholly
unexpected, and Mr. Clay especially remained sanguine as to his triumph up to the last moment.
When the result became known, it was accepted by his friends as a great national calamity and
humiliation.  It shocked and paralyzed them like a great tragedy.  I remember very vividly
one zealous Whig, afterward a prominent Free Soiler and Republican leader, who was so utterly
overwhelmed that for a week he lost the power of sleep, and gave himself up to political sorrow
and despair.  Letters of the most heart-felt condolence poured in upon Mr. Clay from all quarters,
and the Whigs everywhere seemed to feel that no statesman of real eminence could ever be made
President.  They insisted that an overwhelming preponderance of the virtue, intelligence and
respectability of the country had supported their candidate, while the larger element of ignorance
and "unwashed" humanity, including our foreign-born population, gave the victory to Mr. Polk.
Their faith in republican government was fearfully shaken, while the causes of the great disaster
were of course sought out, and made the text of hasty but copious moralizings.  One of these
causes was the Kane letter, which undoubtedly gave Mr. Polk the State of Pennsylvania.  Another
was the baneful influence of "nativism," which had just broken out in the great cities, and
been made the occasion of such frightful riot and bloodshed in Philadelphia as to alarm our
foreign-born citizens, and throw them almost unanimously against the Whigs.  The Abolitionists
declared that Mr. Clay's defeat was caused by his trimming on the annexation question, which
drew from him a sufficient number of conscientious anti-slavery men to have turned the tide
in his favor.  The famous Plaquemine frauds in Louisiana unquestionably lost that State to
Mr. Clay. This infamous conspiracy to strangle the voice of a sovereign State was engineered
by John Slidell, and it consisted of the shipment from New Orleans to Plaquemine of two steamboats
loaded with roughs and villains, whose illegal votes were sufficient to turn the State over
to the Democrats.

But the cause of Mr. Clay's defeat which was dwelt upon with most emphasis and feeling was
the action of the Liberty party.  Birney, its candidate for President, received 66,304 votes,
and these, it was alleged, came chiefly from the Whig party.  The vote of these men in New
York and Michigan was greater than the Democratic majority, so that if they had united with
the Whigs, Clay would have been elected in spite of all other opposition.  Mr. Polk's plurality
over Clay in New York was only 5,106, while Birney received in that State 15,812; and Horace
Greeley insisted that if only one third of this vote had been cast for Mr. Clay, he would have
been President.  The feeling of the Whigs against these anti-slavery men was bitter and damnatory
to the last degree.  The Plaquemine frauds, the Kane letter, and everything else, were forgotten
in the general and abounding wrath against these "fanatics," who were denounced as the betrayers
of their country and of the cause which a very great and critical opportunity had placed it
in their power to save.  "The Abolitionists deserve to be damned, and they will be," said a
zealous Whig to an anti-slavery Quaker; and this was simply the expression of the prevailing
feeling at this time, at least in the West.

But this treatment of the Abolitionists was manifestly unjust. Their organization four years
before was neither untimely nor unnecessary, but belonged to the inevitable logic of a great
and dominating idea.  A party was absolutely necessary which should make this idea paramount,
and utterly refuse to be drawn away from it by any party divisions upon subsidiary questions.
It should be remembered, too, that the Liberty party was made up of Democratic as well as Whig
deserters, and that if it had disbanded, or had not been formed, the result of this election
would have been the same.  The statement of Mr. Greeley, that one third of Birney's vote in
New York would have elected Clay, was unwarranted, unless he was able to show what would have
been the action of the other two thirds.  In justice to these Abolitionists it should also
be remembered and recorded, to say the very least, that Mr. Clay himself divided with them
the responsibility of his defeat by his Alabama letter, and that now, in the clear perspective
of history, they stand vindicated against their Whig assailants, whose fevered brains and party
intolerance blinded their eyes to the truth. Doubtless there were honest differences of opinion
as to the best method of serving the anti-slavery cause in this exasperating campaign, and
these differences may still survive as an inheritance; but abolitionism, as a working force
in our politics, had to have a beginning, and no man who cherishes the memory of the old Free
Soil party, and of the larger one to which it gave birth, will withhold the meed of his praise
from the heroic little band of sappers and miners who blazed the way for the armies which were
to follow, and whose voices, though but faintly heard in the whirlwind of 1840, were made significantly
audible in 1844.  Although they were everywhere totally misunderstood and grossly misrepresented,
they clearly comprehended their work and courageously entered upon its performance.  Their
political creed was substantially identical with that of the Free Soilers of 1848 and the Republicans
of 1856 and 1860.  They were anything but political fanatics, and history will record that
their sole offense was the espousal of the truth in advance of the multitude, which slowly
and finally followed in their footsteps.

But the war against slavery was not at all intermitted by the victory of the Democrats.  Events
are schoolmasters, and this triumph only quickened their march toward the final catastrophe.
Cassius M. Clay, who had espoused the Whig cause in this canvass with great vigor and zeal,
and on anti-slavery grounds, re-enlisted in the battle against slavery, and resolved to prosecute
it by new methods.  He had been sorely tried by Mr. Clay's Alabama letter and the Whig defeat,
but he was now armed with fresh courage, and resolved to "carry the war into Africa" by the
establishment of his newspaper, the "True American," in Lexington, in his own State. His arraignment
of slavery was so eloquent and masterly that a large meeting of slave-holders appointed a committee
to wait on him, and request the discontinuance of his paper.  His reply was: "Go, tell your
secret conclave of cowardly assassins that Cassius M. Clay knows his rights, and how to defend
them."  These words thrilled all lovers of liberty, and sounded to them like a trumpet call
to battle.  Another fruitful event was the effort of Massachusetts, in the fall of this year,
to protect her colored seamen in the ports of Charleston and New Orleans, where they were seized
on merchant ships and sold into slavery under local police regulations. When Mr. Hoar visited
Charleston as the accredited agent of his State for the purpose of taking measures to test
the constitutionality of these regulations, the Legislature of South Carolina, by a vote of
one hundred and nineteen against one, passed a series of outrageous resolutions culminating
in a request to the Governor to expel him from the State as a confessed disturber of the peace.
He was obliged summarily to depart, as the only means of escaping the vengeance of the mob.
This open and insolent defiance of the national authority could not fail to strengthen anti-slavery
opinion in the Northern States.  The same end was served by an unexpected movement in New Hampshire.
This State, like Massachusetts and Vermont, had taken ground against annexation, but it wheeled
into line after Polk was nominated.  John P. Hale, however, then a Democratic member of Congress
from that State, refused to follow his party, and for this reason, after he had been formally
declared its choice for re-election, he was thrown overboard, and another candidate nominated.
No election, however, was effected, and his seat remained vacant during the 29th Congress,
but he obtained a seat in the Legislature in 1846, and the following year was chosen United
States Senator, while Amos Tuck, afterward a prominent Free Soiler, was elected to the Lower
House of Congress.  These were pregnant events, and especially the triumph of Hale, who became
a very formidable champion of freedom, and a thorn in the side of slavery till it perished.

In the meantime the hunger for immediate annexation had been whetted by the election of Mr.
Polk, and its champions hurried up their work, and pushed it by methods in open disregard of
the Constitution and of our treaty obligations with Mexico.  In the last hours of the administration
of John Tyler the atrocious plot received its finishing touch and the Executive approval, and,
in the apt words of the ablest and fairest historian of the transaction, "the bridal dress
in which Calhoun had led the beloved of the slaveocracy to the Union was the torn and tattered
Constitution of the United States."  War with Mexico, as prophesied by the Whigs, speedily
followed.  As early as August, 1845, General Taylor was ordered by President Polk to advance
to a position on the Nueces.  In March of the following year, in pursuance of further orders,
his army again advanced, taking its position on the east bank of the Rio Grande, and, of course,
on the soil of Mexico.  Hostilities naturally followed, and after two battles the President,
in his message to Congress, declared that "American blood has been shed on American soil."
This robust Executive falsehood, with which the slave power compelled him to face the civilized
world, must always hold a very high rank in the annals of public audacity and crime.  In the
message of the President referred to, he recommended that a considerable sum of money be placed
at his disposal for the purpose of negotiating a peace, and it was on the consideration of
this message that David Wilmot fortunately obtained the floor, and moved his memorable proviso
for the interdiction of slavery in any territory which might be wrested from Mexico by our
arms.  This was the session of Congress for 1846-47, and the proposition passed the House with
great unanimity as to the Northern members.  At the following session of Congress, on the 28th
of February, 1848, the proviso again came before the House, and the motion to lay it on the
table failed, all the Whigs and a large majority of the Democrats from the free States voting
in the negative.  It passed the House on the 13th of December following, on a similar division
of parties and sections, but the Senate refused to concur, and the Thirtieth Congress adjourned
without any provisions whatever for the organization or government of our recently acquired
Territories.

It is worth while to notice in passing that on the first introduction of the Wilmot proviso,
in August, 1846, General Cass was decidedly in its favor, and regretted that it had been talked
to death by the long speech of John Davis; but on the 24th of December, 1847, he wrote his
famous "Nicholson letter," proclaiming his gospel of "popular sovereignty" in the Territories,
which proved the seed- plot of immeasurable national trouble and disaster.  This was thoroughly
characteristic, and in perfect harmony with his action, already referred to, respecting the
Quintuple treaty; but it showed how the political waters were being troubled by the slavery
question, and how impossible it was to accommodate the growing anti-slavery feeling of the
country by any shallow expedients.

But another conspiracy against freedom was now hatched; and if the Senate had strangled the
Wilmot proviso, it was gratifying to find the House ready to strangle this monster of senatorial
birth.  I allude to the now almost forgotten "Clayton Compromise," which passed the Senate
by a decided majority on the 26th of July.  By submitting the whole question of slavery in
all our Territories to the Supreme Court of the United States, as then constituted, it would
almost certainly have spawned the curse in all of them, including Oregon, which had long been
exposed to peril and massacre by the reckless opposition of our slave-masters to a government
there without the recognition of slavery.  The defeat of this nefarious proposition, which
was happily followed by the passage of a bill giving Oregon a territorial government, is largely
due to Alexander H. Stephens, whose motion to lay it on the table in the House prevailed by
a small majority.  In this action he had the courage to separate himself from the great body
of the leading men of his own section; but in doing so he was prompted by his supreme devotion
to slavery.  This he has since denied and labored to explain in his private correspondence
and published works, but the record is fatally against him.  He was unwilling to trust the
interests of the South in the hands of the Supreme Court, and his speech of August 7th, in
the House of Representatives, in defense of his motion, gave very plausible reasons for his
apprehensions; but the Dred Scott decision of a few years later showed how completely he misjudged
that tribunal, and how opportunely his blindness came to the rescue of freedom.  It seems now
to have been providential; for in this Continental plot against liberty the superior sagacity
of Calhoun and his associates was demonstrated by subsequent events, while Mr. Stephens, with
his great influence in the South, could almost certainly have secured its triumph if he had
become its champion instead of its enemy.

The approach of another presidential year was thus marked by a steadily growing interest in
the question of slavery.  The conflict with it seemed far more irrepressible than ever before.
The Liberty party had nominated John P. Hale as its candidate in 1847.  The Whigs in Massachusetts
were threatened with an incurable division into "Conscience Whigs" and "Cotton Whigs," growing
out of the question of annexation and the government of our new Territories. The same causes
were dividing the Democrats of New York, and the feud was seriously aggravated by remembering
the defeat of Mr. Van Buren in 1844, for the one sin of opposing the immediate annexation of
Texas, while a large majority of the party favored his nomination. The Van Buren element in
the Democratic party threatened revolt in other States, while both Whigs and Democrats in the
North were committed to the policy of the Wilmot proviso.  This was to be the great question
of the ensuing national canvass, and the roused spirit of the people of the free States seemed
clearly to foreshadow the triumph of freedom in the organization and government of our Mexican
acquisitions.

But the virtue and courage of our politicians were now to be severely tried.  The power of
party discipline and the tempting bait of the spoils were to be employed as never before in
swerving men from their convictions.  The South, of course, was a perfect unit, and fully resolved
upon the spread of slavery over our Territories. It had always been the absolute master of
the Northern Democracy, and had no dream of anything less than the supremacy of its own will.
Its favorite candidate was now Gen. Cass, and he was nominated by the Baltimore National Convention
on the 22d day of May.  It was a fit nomination for the party of slavery.  He had been thirsting
for it many years, and had earned it by multiplied acts of the most obsequious and crouching
servility to his Southern overseers. Again and again he had crawled in the dust at their feet,
and, if they could not now reward him with the presidency, it seemed utterly useless for any
Northern man to hope for their favor.  The "Nicholson letter" was not all that the South wanted,
but it was a very important concession, and with Gen. Cass as its interpreter it meant the
nearest thing possible to a complete surrender.  In this National Convention the State of New
York had two sets of delegates, both of which were formally admitted, as a compromise; but
the members of the Van Buren or Free Soil wing refused to take their seats, and thus held themselves
in reserve for such revolutionary work as should afterward seem to them advisable.

The Whig National Convention met in Philadelphia on the 7th of June.  The party seemed completely
demoralized by the defeat of Mr. Clay in the previous canvass, and was now in search of "an
available candidate," and inspired by the same miserable policy of expediency which had been
so barren of results in 1840.  The Northern Whigs appeared to be unanimously and zealously
committed to the prohibition of slavery in our Territories, but equally unanimous and zealous
in the determination to succeed in the canvass.  For more than a year Gen. Taylor had been
growing into favor with the party as a candidate, and he had now become decidedly formidable.
The spectacle was a melancholy one, since it demonstrated the readiness of this once respectable
old party to make complete shipwreck of everything wearing the semblance of principle, for
the sake of success.  General Taylor had never identified himself in any way with the Whig
party.  He had spent his life as a mere soldier on the frontier, and had never given a vote.
He had frankly said he had not made up his mind upon the questions which divided the parties.
He not only refused to be the exponent of Whig principles, but accepted the nomination of bodies
of men not known as Whigs, who scouted the idea of being bound by the acts of any national
convention.  He was a very large slave-owner, and thus identified in interest, and presumably
in sympathy, with the South; but he could not be induced to define his position.  His active
supporters were chiefly from the slave-holding States and those free States which had generally
given Democratic majorities, while the men most violent in their opposition to the Wilmot proviso
were his most conspicuous followers; but the Whigs from the free States vouched for his soundness
on the slavery issue.  His letters contained nothing but vague generalities, and he utterly
declined to commit himself on the question that was stirring the nation to its depths.  To
the different sections of the Union he wore a different face, and each section seemed confident
that the other would be duped, while cordially joining in a common struggle for the spoils
of office which constituted the sole bond of union. His early letters, before he fell into
the hands of the politicians, were frank and unstudied, reflecting his character as a plain
old soldier without any political training; but his later letters were diplomatic, not wanting
in style and finish, and obviously written by others.  His second letter to Allison, on which
the campaign was finally fought, was written in the room of Alexander H. Stephens, in Washington,
after consulting with Toombs and Crittenden, and afterward forwarded to Taylor, who gave it
to the world as his own. He had constantly about him a sort of political body-guard, or "committee
of safety," to direct his way during the canvass, and no one could reasonably pretend that
any principle whatever would be settled by the election.  He had whipped the Mexicans, and
the Whig platform was "Rough and Ready," "A little more Grape, Captain Bragg," and political
success.

The nomination, moreover, was accomplished by methods which made it exceedingly exasperating
to Mr. Clay and his friends.  The treachery of the Whig managers to their great leader exceeded
that which had sacrificed him at the Harrisburg Convention of 1839. The Whigs of Virginia nominated
Taylor on the credit of a forged dispatch, to the effect that Kentucky had decided in his favor,
and thus abandoned her favorite son.  General Scott had expressed his willingness to run for
Vice President if Clay should be nominated for President, but the member of Congress who had
been authorized to make this known kept it a secret.  Clay allowed his name to go before the
Convention on the assurance of Governor Bebb that Ohio would stand by him, but the delegation
voted for Scott.  On the first ballot, even seven delegates from Kentucky voted for Taylor,
and he was nominated by 171 votes, with 63 for Scott, and only 32 for Clay.  Of the votes for
Taylor, on the first ballot, 97 were cast by States that had voted for Polk in 1844; and of
the 94 Whig delegates from the Free States he received the votes of only four. He was nominated
as the candidate of the Whigs who believed in the extension of slavery, by a Convention which
repeatedly and contemptuously voted down the Wilmot proviso, already endorsed by all the Whig
Legislatures of the Free States, while no platform of principles was adopted; and Horace Greeley
was thus perfectly justified in branding it as "the slaughter-house of Whig principles." Such
an exhibition of shameless political prostitution has rarely been witnessed, and three of the
leading Whigs of Massachusetts-- Charles Allen, Henry Wilson, and Stephen C. Phillips--left
the Convention in disgust, and severed their connection with the party forever.

In this state of the country, and of the old parties, a new organization and another nomination
became inevitable.  The followers of Mr. Van Buren, in New York and other States, were aching
for the opportunity to make themselves felt in avenging the wrong done to their chief in 1844,
and were quite ready to strike hands with the members of the Liberty party.  The members of
that party were generally ready to withdraw their candidate for President and unite with the
anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats of the Northern States, if an honorable basis of action could
be agreed upon.  The "Conscience Whigs" of Massachusetts, and thousands of Whigs in other States,
who regarded the freedom of our Territories as a vital issue, and were thoroughly soured by
the nomination of General Taylor, were equally anxious to fuse with the other elements of political
discontent, and make their voices heard in a new and independent organization.  There was little
time for delay, and as soon as the troubled political elements would permit, a call was issued
for a National Free Soil Convention, at Buffalo, on the 9th of August.

The Convention was historic.  It marked a new and significant departure in party politics,
and was a conspicuous milestone in the anti-slavery journey.  It met in a spacious pavilion,
and was one of the largest political gatherings ever assembled in the country, and animated
by unbounded earnestness and enthusiasm. Its leading spirits were men of character and undisputed
ability. The "Barnburners" of New York were largely in attendance, including such veteran leaders
as Preston King, Benjamin F. Butler, David Dudley Field, Samuel J. Tilden, and James W. Nye.
Ohio sent a formidable force headed by Joshua R. Giddings, Salmon Chase, and Samuel Lewis.
The "Conscience Whigs" of Massachusetts were well represented, with Charles Francis Adams,
Stephen C. Phillips, and Francis W. Bird, in the front.  The Liberty party sent its delegates,
including such men as the Rev. Joshua Leavitt, Samuel Lewis, and Henry B. Stanton.  The disappointed
Clay Whigs were there, led by such representative men as Joseph L. White, who were eager to
lay hold of any weapon by which they could hope to strike down the betrayers of the Whig cause.
The "Land Reformers" and "Workingmen" of New York were represented, as also the special advocates
of "Cheap postage for the people," who longed to be rid of the tariff of twenty-five cents
on the privilege of sending a single letter through the mails, and whose wishes afterward found
expression in the platform.

Could these elements be harmonized?  Could the bolters from the Whig party overcome their traditional
hatred of Martin Van Buren? If so, could the Liberty party men be prevailed upon to give up
their chosen candidate, and labor for the election of the "foxy old politician" whose reputation
for tricky and ambidextrous political methods had become proverbial?  If not, could the Barnburners,
with their large following, be united on the candidate of the Liberty party, or some new man?
These questions had to be met; but preliminary to the nomination was the construction of a
platform.  This was accomplished without serious difficulty, and, considering the circumstances
of the country, it was perhaps the most admirable declaration of principles ever promulgated
by any party.

The nominating Convention assembled in the large Universalist Church in Buffalo.  Mr. Van Buren
was not understood as desiring the nomination, but it was now authoritatively stated that he
would accept it if tendered, and that he would, without hesitation or evasions, accept the
platform of the Convention.  The different elements of this movement had been in conference,
and the time for action was at hand.  In common with my Whig associates, I had all along felt
that I could not support Mr. Van Buren under any circumstances; but the pervading tone of earnestness
in the Convention, and the growing spirit of political fraternity, had modified our views.
We saw that several of the great leaders of the Liberty party were quite ready to meet the
"Barnburners" on common ground.  It seemed very desirable to combine with so large a body of
helpers, and to profit by their experience and training in the school of practical politics.
Mr. Van Buren had certainly gone great lengths as the servant of the slave power, but there
was one great and vital issue to freedom on which he had taken the right side, and maintained
it without flinching in the presence of a great temptation; and for this he had been anathematized
by the South, and driven into retirement.  If nominated by the anti- slavery men of the free
States, and squarely committed to their principles, it was altogether improbable, if not morally
impossible, that he would again lend himself to the service of slavery.  Besides, the whole
country had been so demoralized by this evil that it was not easy to find any public man of
eminence whose record had been spotless; and it was a part of the work of earnest anti-slavery
men to forget party memories and prejudices for the sake of the cause, and to cultivate the
virtues of hope and trust, rather than the spirit of doubt and suspicion, in dealing with a
man who was now ready to unfurl the flag of freedom, and had been stricken down by her foes.
The nomination of Mr. Van Buren would undoubtedly mean the freedom of our Territories and the
denationalization of slavery, and this was the great point.  In this movement there was no
element of compromise.  It was wholly unhampered by a Southern wing; and even should the nominee
betray the men who now trusted him, their choice of him, as their standard bearer, would be
vindicated by the circumstances of the hour.

Mr. Chase, then in the prime of his manhood, and a splendid figure, was the president of this
nominating Convention, and its work proceeded.  There was a feeling of intense anxiety about
the result, and an earnestness and real seriousness which I have never witnessed in any other
Convention.  There were leading Whigs and Liberty party men, whose action in respect to Mr.
Van Buren was not yet generally known.  Several delegates remarked, "I want to know what Samuel
Lewis will do before I decide," or, "I want to hear from Joshua Leavitt."  After the nomination
of Mr. Van Buren had been moved, Mr. Leavitt rose from his seat, and all eyes were instantly
turned upon him.  He was then in middle life, and his tall and erect form and fine physiognomy
were singularly striking.  He was full of emotion, and seemed at first to lack the power of
utterance, while the stillness of death prevailed in the Convention.  He began by saying: 
"Mr. Chairman, this is the most solemn experience of my life.  I feel as if in the immediate
presence of the Divine Spirit."  He paused here for a few moments, while there did not seem
to be a dry eye in the Convention; but he proceeded grandly with his speech, defined his position,
and seconded the motion for Mr. Van Buren's nomination, upon which the mingled political enthusiasm
and religious fervor of the Convention broke over all bounds, and utterly defied description.
Men laughed and cried at the same time, and gave themselves up to the perfect abandon of their
feelings.  All divisions had completely died away, and the nomination of Mr. Van Buren by acclamation
became a matter of course.  Charles Francis Adams was then nominated for Vice President, when
the Convention adjourned, and its members returned to their homes to prepare for the coming
canvass under the banner of "Van Buren and Free Soil--Adams and Liberty."

The new national party was now launched, and the work of the presidential canvass began in
earnest.  John A. Dix, then one of the United States Senators from New York, was nominated
for Governor, with Seth M. Gates, the anti-slavery colleague of Adams and Giddings in Congress,
for Lieutenant-Governor.  The Free Soil State Convention of Ohio set the ball in motion in
that State, and the new party, by securing the balance of power in the Legislature, was able
to place Mr. Chase in the Senate of the United States.  Stephen C. Phillips was nominated for
Governor in Massachusetts, where the movement was very formidable, and exceedingly annoying
to the "Cotton Whigs."  Like conventions were held in Indiana and other free States, organizations
effected, and candidates nominated, while the movement extended to the border slave states,
in which it afterward did excellent service.  The canvass of the Democrats was not remarkably
enthusiastic.  The division of the party and the probable loss of the State of New York had
a very depressing influence.  The Whig canvass was perhaps marked by still less earnestness
and spirit.  It was hollow and false, and the best men in the party felt it.  The only enthusiasm
of the campaign was in the new party, and it was perfectly spontaneous and fervid.  The most
remarkable feature of this contest was the bitterness of the Whigs toward the Free Soilers,
and especially those who had deserted from the Whig ranks.  They seemed to be maddened by the
imputation that they were not perfectly sound on the Free Soil issue.  This was particularly
true of Mr. Webster, who had been branded by Mr. Adams as a "Traitor to freedom," as far back
as the year 1843, and who afterward justified these strong words in his "Seventh of March Speech."
In the Whig State Convention of Massachusetts, held at Springfield, in 1847, Mr. Webster, speaking
of the Wilmot proviso, had said:  "Did I not commit myself to that in the year 1838, fully,
entirely?  I do not consent that more recent discoverers shall take out a patent for the discovery.
Allow me to say, sir, it is not their thunder."  He then claimed Free Soil as a distinctive
Whig doctrine, and in a speech at Abingdon, he now said:  "The gentlemen who have joined this
new party, from among the Whigs, pretend that they are greater lovers of liberty and greater
haters of slavery than those they leave behind them.  I do not admit it.  I do not admit any
such thing.  I think we are as good Free Soil men as they are."  The same ground was urged
by Washington Hunt, James Brooks, and other leading Whigs; and Mr. Greeley declared that "at
no time previously had Whig inculcations throughout the free States been so decidedly and strongly
hostile to the extension of slavery, and so determined in requiring its inhibition by Congress,
as during the canvass of 1848."  These statements appear very remarkable, when it is remembered
that the Whig nominee was a Louisiana planter, and that he was nominated at the bidding of
the slave-holding wing of the party, and by a convention which not only contemptuously voted
down the Wilmot proviso, but treated its advocates as "fanatics."  But even Governor Seward
strangely clung to the old party after the death and burial of its conscience, and seriously
brought his personal integrity into question by urging the support of General Taylor upon those
who favored the abolition of slavery. In a speech at Cleveland, Ohio, in October of that year,
he said: "Freedom insists on the emancipation and development of labor; slavery demands a soil
moistened with tears and blood--freedom a soil that exults under the elastic tread of man in
his native majesty.  These elements divide and classify the American people into two parties,"
and he proceeded to argue as if the Whigs and Democrats were thus divided, when he knew that
both were in the absolute control of the slave power.

The Free Soilers, of course, did not particularly relish these moral lectures on slavery by
men who had sold their principles at public auction for the chance of office and plunder through
the elevation of a mere military chieftain to the Presidency.  But the Whigs were not content
with claiming the complete monopoly of anti- slavery virtue, and parading it before the country;
they became abusive and insulting to the full measure of their insincerity. Their talk about
"renegades" and "apostates" anticipated the abuse heaped upon the Greeley men of 1872, when
the Republican party had so completely triumphed over the integrity of its earlier life. The
course of the Whigs in Indiana supplies a striking illustration. After the presidential election
of 1844, I resolved that I would never vote for another slaveholder, and the course of events
and my own reflections had constantly strengthened this purpose.  I saw no honorable way of
escape, and my position was well known to my Whig brethren; but, as soon as General Taylor
was nominated, the policy of browbeating and threats was invoked.  I had no taste for politics,
and had determined to devote myself entirely to my profession.  I was especially anxious to
avoid any strife with the Whigs, who were overwhelmingly in the ascendant in Eastern Indiana,
and in whose ranks were most of my clients and best friends.  But the party leaders talked
to me in the imperative mood.  They saw my embarrassment, and seemed determined to coerce me
into submission by the supposed extremity of my situation; and I was obliged to offer them
open defiance.  I was made an elector for Van Buren and Adams in the Fourth Indiana District,
and entered upon the contest with a will; and from that time forth I was subjected to a torrent
of billingsgate which rivalled the fish market.  Words were neither minced nor mollified, but
made the vehicles of political wrath and the explosions of personal malice.  The charge of
"abolitionism" was flung at me everywhere, and it is impossible now to realize the odium then
attaching to that term by the general opinion.  I was an "amalgamationist" and a "woolly-head."
I was branded as the "apostle of disunion" and "the orator of free-dirt."  It was a standing
charge of the Whigs that I carried in my pocket a lock of the hair of Frederick Douglass, to
regale my senses with its aroma when I grew faint.  They declared that my audiences consisted
of "eleven men, three boys, and a negro," and sometimes I could not deny this inventory was
not very far from the truth.  I was threatened with mob violence by my own neighbors, and treated
as if slavery had been an established institution of the State, with its machinery of overseers
and background of pauperized whites; while these same Whigs, as if utterly unconscious of the
irony of their professions, uniformly resolved, in their conventions, that "the Whig party
is the only true Free Soil party."

I was not, of course, a non-resistant in the warfare, and for two months I gave myself up to
the work absolutely.  I was seriously embarrassed in the outset by the question of transportation,
having neither horse nor carriage, nor the financial ability to procure either; but an anti-slavery
Quaker, and personal friend, named Jonathan Macy, came to my rescue.  He furnished me an old
white horse, fully seventeen hands high, and rather thin in flesh, but which served my purpose
pretty well.  I named him "Old Whitey," in honor of General Taylor's famous war steed, and
sallied forth in the work of the campaign.  Having a first-class pair of lungs and much physical
endurance, I frequently spoke as often as three times a day, and generally from two to three
hours at each meeting.  I spoke at cross-roads, in barns, in pork houses, in saw-mills, in
any place in which a few or many people would hear me; but I was rarely permitted to enter
any of the churches.  I was so perfectly swallowed up in my work and dominated by the singleness
of my purpose, that I took no thought of anything else; and the vigor of my invective in dealing
with the scurrilous attacks of my assailants was very keenly realized, and, I believe, universally
acknowledged. With the truth on my side, I was delighted to find myself perfectly able, single-handed,
to fight my battle against the advantages of superior talent and the trained leadership of
men of established reputations on the stump.  But the fight, as I have said, was unspeakably
relentless, vitriolic and exhausting, and nothing could redeem it but an overmastering sense
of duty and self-respect. The worst passions of humanity were set on fire among the Whigs by
this provoking insurrection against their party as the mere tool of slavery, while animosities
were engendered that still survive, and which many men have carried to their graves.  This
is only a single illustration of the spirit of the canvass, for similar conflicts marked the
struggle in Ohio, Massachusetts and other States, and they were made inevitable by the desperation
of a party already dead in its trespasses, and which deserved a funeral instead of a triumph.

The results of this contest were most remarkable.  General Taylor was elected but his triumph
was the death of the Whig party.  The long-coveted prize of the presidency was snatched from
General Cass, and the Democratic party divided and humiliated by its struggle to serve two
masters, while the friends of Mr. Van Buren had their longed-for revenge.  The Free Soil ticket
received a little less than three hundred thousand votes, and failed to carry the electoral
vote of a single State; but the effect of the movement was inestimably important.  It seated
Chase in the United States Senate from Ohio, and sent to the lower branch of Congress a sufficient
number of anti-slavery men from different States to hold the balance of power in that body.
It was very savingly felt in Congress in July of this year, on the vote by which Oregon, with
a territory nearly equal to that of the thirteen original States, narrowly escaped the damnation
of slavery.  It emphasized the demand of the million for "cheap postage," and the freedom of
the public domain, and thus helped stereotype these great measures into law; and it played
its part in creating the public opinion which compelled the admission of California as a free
State.  These were great achievements, but they were mere preliminaries to the magnificent
and far-reaching work of succeeding years, of which the revolt of 1848 was the promise and pledge.

The scheme of "pacification" and "final settlement," which was launched in 1850, under the
leadership of Henry Clay, constitutes one of the chief landmarks in the history of the great
conflict between freedom and slavery.  It was the futile attempt of legislative diplomacy to
escape the fatal logic of antecedent facts.  The war with Mexico, like the annexation of Texas
which paved the way for it, was inspired by the lust for slave territory.  No sophistry could
disguise this fact, nor could its significance be overstated. The prophets of slavery saw clearly
that restriction meant destruction. They girded themselves for battle on this issue, and were
not at all placated by Northern disclaimers of "abolitionism," and reiterated disavowals of
any right or purpose to intermeddle with slavery as the creature of State law.  Its existence
was menaced by the policy of confinement and ultimate suffocation; and therefore no compromise
of the pending strife over its prohibition in New Mexico, Utah and California was possible.

This strife was aggravated by its peculiar relations to the dominant political parties.  The
sacrifice of Martin Van Buren in 1844, because of his manly letter on the annexation of Texas,
had been a sore trial to his devoted friends.  They could neither forgive nor forget it; and
when the opportunity for revenge finally came in 1848, they laid hold of it with the sincerest
and most heartfelt satisfaction.  As we have seen, they bolted from their party, threw themselves
into the Free Soil movement, and thus made the defeat of Gen. Cass inevitable by the election
of Gen. Taylor.  Thousands of these bolting Democrats, particularly in the State of New York,
cared more for the personal and political fortunes of Mr. Van Buren than for the slavery question,
as their subsequent return to their party allegiance made manifest; but their action was none
the less decisive in the emergency which called it forth.  The trouble in the Whig camp was
also serious.  The last hopes of Mr. Clay and his worshipers had perished forever in the nomination
of the hero of the Mexican war and the owner of two hundred slaves, by a Convention which became
famous as "the slaughter house of Whig principles."  Very many of these Clay Whigs, like the
devotees of Mr. Van Buren, would have been satisfied with almost any dispensation of the slavery
issue if their chief had been nominated, but they were now enlisted in the anti-slavery army,
and, like Joseph L. White, of Indiana, vociferously shouted for "liberty and revenge." Mr.
Webster and his friends were also profoundly disgusted, and lent a strong hand to the work
of party insubordination, while the election of Gen. Taylor was quite naturally followed by
formidable party coalitions.  One of these, as already stated, made Salmon P. Chase a senator
of the United States from Ohio, as John P. Hale had been chosen from New Hampshire some time
before, and Charles Sumner came in a little later from Massachusetts; and the House of Representatives
now contained nine distinctly anti-slavery men, chosen from different States by kindred combinations,
who had completely renounced their allegiance to the old parties, and were able to wield the
balance of power in that body.  Such were the complications of the great problem which confronted
the Thirty- first Congress at the opening of its first session, on the third day of December, 1849.

In this Congress I was a representative, for the first time, of the Fourth Indiana District.
This district contained a large Quaker population, and in the matter of liberality and progress
was in advance of all other portions of the State; and yet the immeasurable wrath and scorn
which were lavished upon the men who deserted the Whig party on account of the nomination of
General Taylor can scarcely be conceived.  The friends of a life-time were suddenly turned
to enemies, and their words were often dipped in venom.  It seemed as if a section of Kentucky
or Virginia had in some way usurped the geography of Eastern Indiana, bringing with it the
discipline of the slave-master, and a considerable importation of "white trash."  The contest
was bitter beyond all precedent; but after a hard fight, and by a union of Free Soilers, Democrats,
and Independent Whigs, I was elected by a small majority.  Owing to serious illness, resulting
from the excitement and overwork of the canvass, I did not reach Washington till the 19th of
December--just in time to cast my vote for speaker on the fifty-sixth ballot in this first
important "dead-lock" in the organization of the House. With the exception of two Indiana members,
I had no personal acquaintance in either branch of Congress, and, on entering the old Hall
of Representatives, my first thought was to find the Free Soil members, whose political fortunes
and experience had been so similar to my own.  The seat of Mr. Giddings was pointed out to
me in the northwest corner of the Hall, where I found the stalwart champion of free speech
busy with his pen.  He received me with evident cordiality, and at once sent a page for the
other Free Soil members.  Soon the "immortal nine," as we were often sportively styled, were
all together:  David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, then famous as the author of the "Provsio," short
and corpulent in person, and emphatic in speech; Preston King, of New York, with his still
more remarkable rotundity of belt, and a face beaming with good humor; the eccentric and witty
"Jo Root," of Ohio, always ready to break a lance with the slave-holders; Charles Allen, of
Massachusetts, the quiet, dignified, clear-headed and genial gentleman, but a good fighter
and the unflinching enemy of slavery; Charles Durkee, of Wisconsin, the fine-looking and large-hearted
philanthropist, whose enthusiasm never cooled; Amos Tuck, of New Hampshire, amiable and somewhat
feminine in appearance, but firm in purpose; John W. Howe, of Pennsylvania, with a face radiant
with smiles and good will, and full of anti-slavery fervor; and Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio,
with his broad shoulders, giant frame, unquenchable love of freedom, and almost as familiar
with the slavery question, in all its aspects, as he was with the alphabet. These, all now
gone to their reckoning, were the elect of freedom in the lower branch of this memorable Congress.
They all greeted me warmly, and the more so, perhaps, because my reported illness and doubtful
recovery had awakened a peculiar interest in my fortunes at that time, on account of the political
situation, and the possible significance of a single vote.  John P. Hale happened to enter
the hall during these congratulations, and still further lighted up the scene by his jolly
presence; while Dr. Bailey, of the "National Era," also joined in the general welcome, and
at once confirmed all the good opinions I had formed of this courageous and single- minded
friend of the slave.  I was delighted with all my brethren, and at once entered fully into
their plans and counsels.

An incident connected with the organization of the House, which caused intense excitement at
the time, seems to deserve some notice. It occurred on the 12th of December, while William
J. Brown, of Indiana, was being voted for as the Democratic candidate for Speaker. He was a
pro-slavery Democrat, through and through, and commanded the entire and unhesitating confidence
of Southern members; and yet, on the last ballot for him, he received the votes of Allen, Durkee,
Giddings, King, and Wilmot, and came within two votes of an election.  The support of Mr. Brown
by the leading Free Soilers was a great surprise to both sides of the House, and the suspicion
that some secret arrangement had been made gave birth to a rumor to that effect.  After the
balloting, while Mr. Bailey, of Virginia, was on the floor, Mr. Ashmun, of Massachusetts, asked
him whether a secret correspondence had not taken place between some member of the Free Soil
party and Mr. Brown, by which the latter had agreed to constitute the Committees on the Judiciary,
on Territories, and on the District of Columbia, in a manner satisfactory to that party. Mr.
Bailey scouted the idea, and asked Mr. Ashmun what authority he had for the statement.  Mr.
Ashmun replied, "Common rumor"; to which Mr. Bailey rejoined, "Does not the gentleman know
that common rumor is a common liar?"  Turning to Mr. Brown, he said, "Has any such correspondence
taken place?"  Mr. Brown shook his head, and Mr. Bailey became more emphatic than ever in his
denial.  But the fever was now up, and the Southern members scented treason.  Several of them
withheld their votes from Mr. Brown because of his Free Soil support, and thus prevented his
election.  He was in a very trying dilemma with his Southern friends, while the Free Soilers
who had supported him were also placed in a novel predicament, and subjected to catechism.
The fact was finally revealed in the course of a long and exciting debate, that Mr. Wilmot
had entered into a correspondence with Mr. Brown on the subject of the organization of the
Committees named, and that the latter had promised in writing to constitute them as stated
in Mr. Ashumn's inquiry-- declaring that he had "always been opposed to the extension of slavery,"
and believed that "the Federal Government should be relieved from the responsibility of slavery
where it had the constitutional right to abolish it."  This, in substance, was the whole Free
Soil gospel; and the disappointment and rage of Southern members, when the letter was produced,
can be more easily imagined than described.  Mr. Brown labored very painfully to explain his
letter and pacify his Southern friends, but the effort was utterly vain.  He was branded with
treachery and duplicity by Bailey, Harris, Burt, Venable, Stanton, and McMullen, while no man
from the South pretended to excuse him.  In the midst of great excitement he withdrew from
the contest for Speaker, and the catastrophe of his secret maneuver was so unspeakably humiliating
that even his enemies pitied him.  But he was unjustly dealt with by his Southern brethren,
whose fear of betrayal and morbid sensitiveness made all coolness of judgment impossible. 
While he possessed very social and kindly personal traits of character, no man in this Congress
was more inflexibly true to slavery, as his subsequent career amply demonstrated.  If he had
been chosen Speaker he would doubtless have placed some of the Free Soil members on the Committees
specified, but the whole power of his office would have been studiously subservient to the
behests of the slave oligarchy; and nothing could excuse the conduct of Mr. Wilmot and his
associates but their entire ignorance of his political character and antecedents.  I regretted
this affair most sincerely, for I knew Mr. Brown well, and could undoubtedly have prevented
the negotiation if I had been present.

The Speakership was obviously the first question on which the slave power must be met in the
Thirty-first Congress.  No question could more completely have presented the entire controversy
between the free and slave States which had so stirred the country during the previous eighteen
months.  In view of the well-nigh autocratic power of the Speaker over legislative measures,
no honest Free Soiler could vote for a candidate who was not known to be sound on the great
issue.  We could not support Howell Cobb, of Georgia, the nominee of the Democratic party,
however anxious our Democratic constituents might be to have us do so; nor could we vote for
Robert C. Winthrop, of Massachusetts, to please the Whigs and semi-Free Soilers who affiliated
with them, since Giddings, Palfrey and others had demonstrated that he was wholly untrustworthy
in facing the ragged issue of slavery.  This had been proved by his acts as Speaker in the
preceding Congress.  We therefore united in the determination to vote for neither of these
candidates.  The contest was protracted till December 22d, when, on the sixty third ballot,
Mr. Cobb was chosen.  The result was effected, by adopting, at the instigation of the Whigs,
what was called the "plurality rule," the operation of which enabled a minority to choose the
speaker. The Whigs, when they entered upon this proceeding, well knew that the Free Soilers
were willing and anxious to vote for Thaddeus Stevens, or any other reliable member of the
party.  They well knew that none of us would vote for Mr. Winthrop, under any circumstances,
and for excellent reasons which we had announced.  Further, they well knew that without Free
Soil votes Mr. Cobb would certainly be chosen; and yet the angry cry went up from the Whigs
in Congress and throughout the Northern States that the Free Soilers had elected a slave-holder
to be speaker of the House!  For a time the ridiculous charge served the purpose of its authors,
but the subsequent career of Mr. Winthrop finally and entirely vindicated the sagacity of the
men whose resolute opposition had thwarted his ambition.

In the further organization of the House Mr. Campbell, a Tennessee slave-holder, was chosen
clerk on the twentieth ballot, by the help of Southern Democrats, over John W. Forney, who
was then the particular friend of James Buchanan, and who had made himself so conspicuous by
his abuse of anti-slavery men that the Free Soil members could not give him their support.
On the eighth ballot Mr. Glossbrenner, of Pennsylvania, the nominee of the Democrats, was chosen
sergeant-at-arms, and after fourteen ineffectual ballots for doorkeeper, Mr. Horner, the Whig
incumbent in the preceding Congress, was continued by resolution of the House.  This was on
January 18th, and the organization of the House was not yet completed, but further proceedings
in this direction were now postponed till the first of March.

In the meantime the slavery question had been receiving daily attention.  The strife over the
Speakership had necessarily involved it, and constantly provoked its animated discussion. 
The great issue was the Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories, then popularly
known as the "Wilmot proviso"; and the first vote on it was taken December 31st, upon the motion
to lay on the table Mr. Root's resolution which embodied it.  The yeas were 83, nays 101; being
a majority of only 18 in its favor.  The Southern men seemed to gather hope and courage from
this vote.  On January 4th, the President sent in his special message relative to California
and New Mexico, announcing his famous "Non-action" policy, which was simply another name for
the "Non-intervention" dogma of Gen. Cass.  A year before he had declared that the new Territories
must not be "surrendered to the pistol and the bowie-knife"; but a new light now dawned upon
him, and he advised Congress to leave the Territories to themselves till their people should
be prepared to ask admission into the Union as States.  He talked glibly about "geographical
parties" and the "operation of natural causes" as any trained Whig politician, and seemed to
have totally forgotten his repeated pledges not to interfere with the action of Congress respecting
"domestic questions."  While the hand of the Executive was thus at work, extreme men in both
Houses led the way in violent and inflammatory speeches.  "When we ask for justice, and to
be let alone," said Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina, "we are met by the senseless and insane
cry of Union, Union!  Sir, I am disgusted with it.  When it comes from Northern gentlemen who
are attacking us, it falls on my ear as it would do if a band of robbers had surrounded a dwelling,
and when the inmates attempted to resist, the assailants should raise the cry of peace, union,
harmony!"  He gave out the threat, that unless the slave-holders were allowed to extend their
system over the virgin soil of our Territories, they would block the wheels of Government,
and involve the nation in the horrors of civil war.  He charged that the free States "keep
up and foster in the bosoms Abolition Societies, whose main purpose is to scatter fire-brands
throughout the South, to incite servile insurrections, and stimulate by licentious pictures
our negroes to invade the persons of our white women."  Mr. Brown, of Mississippi, said he
regarded slavery "as a great moral, social and religious blessing,--a blessing to the slave,
and a blessing to the master." He graciously admitted that Northern people thought slavery
an evil; but he added, "Very well, think so; but keep your thoughts to yourselves."  Jefferson
Davis, then as ever afterward, the apostle of disunion, declared that "slavery existed in the
tents of the patriarchs, and in the households of His own chosen people"; that "it was established
by the decree of Almighty God," and "sanctioned in the Bible--in both Testaments--from Genesis
to Revelations."  Southern members pointed to the battle-fields of the Revolution, and warned
the people of the free States to beware; while the menace was uttered that if the representatives
of the Northern States should vote California into the Union as a free State, without some
compensating measures to the South, their numbers would be decimated by violence.  Mr. Toombs,
in referring to the exclusion of slavery from the common territory, said "I will then, if I
can, bring my children and my constituents to the altar of liberty, and like Hamilcar, I will
swear them to eternal hostility to your foul domination."  On January 29th, Mr. Clay introduced
his eight resolutions of compromise, which still further weakened the anti-slavery policy of
Northern Whigs; and when, on February 4th, another vote was taken on the Wilmot proviso, it
was laid on the table by yeas 104, noes 75;--showing a majority of 29, and a change of 47 votes
in a little more than one month!  Thus began the sickening career of political apostacy, which
so gathered momentum during the spring and summer months that it became impossible to admit
the free State of California into the Union until the passage of the Texas Boundary Bill and
the new Fugitive Slave Act had been made certain.

Early in the session I called on President Taylor with Mr. Giddings and Judge Allen.  I had
a very strong curiosity to see the man whose name I had used so freely in two exasperating
political campaigns, and desired to stand corrected in my estimate of his character, if I should
find such correction to be demanded by the truth.  Our interview with the old soldier was exceedingly
interesting and amusing.  I decidedly liked his kindly, honest, farmer-like face, and his old-fashioned
simplicity of dress and manners.  His conversation was awkward and labored, and evinced a lack
of self- possession; while his whole demeanor suggested his frontier life, and that he had
reached a position for which he was singularly unfitted by training and experience, or any
natural aptitude.  In the few remarks he addressed to me about farming in the West, he greatly
amused us by saying, "I would like to visit Indiana, and see your plows, hoes--and other reaping
implements"; failing, as he often did, to find the word he wanted.  He frequently mispronounced
his words, hesitated and stammered, and sometimes made a breakdown in the middle of a sentence.
But although he seemed to be in the hands of the slave-holders, and was about to proclaim his
policy of non-intervention with slavery in the Territories, he impressed me as being personally
honest and patriotic.  In this impression I was fully confirmed later in the session, when
he sorrowfully but manfully resisted the attempt of Senator Davis, his son-in-law, and other
extreme men, to bully him into their measures, and avowed his sympathy with the anti-slavery
sentiment of the country.  I believe his dying words in July, "I have tried to do my duty,"
were the key-note of his life, and that in the Presidential campaign of 1848, I did him much,
though unintentional, injustice.

It was about the same time that I called with other Western members to see Mr. Clay, at the
National Hotel.  He received us with the most gracious cordiality, and perfectly captivated
us all by the peculiar and proverbial charm of his manners and conversation.  I remember nothing
like it in the social intercourse of my life. One of our party was Hon. L. D. Campbell, then
a prominent Whig politician of Ohio, and an old friend of Mr. Clay, who seemed anxious to explain
his action in supporting Gen. Scott in the National Convention of 1848.  He failed to satisfy
Mr. Clay, whose eye kindled during the conversation, and who had desired and counted on the
nomination himself.  Mr. Clay, addressing him, but turning to me, said:  "I can readily understand
the position of our friend from Indiana, whose strong opinions on the slavery question governed
his action; but your position was different, and, besides, General Scott had no chance for
the nomination, and you were under no obligation to support him."  He spoke in kindly terms
of the Free Soil men; said they acted consistently in supporting Van Buren in preference to
Taylor, and that the election of the latter would prove the ruin of the Whigs.  I heard Mr.
Clay's great speech in the Senate on the Compromise Measures, and although I believed him to
be radically wrong, I felt myself at times drawn toward him by that peculiar spell which years
before had bound me to him as my idolized political leader.  I witnessed his principal encounters
with Col. Benton during this session, in which I thought the latter had the better of the argument;
but his reply to Mr. Barnwell, of South Carolina, on July 22d, in which he said:  "I owe a
paramount allegiance to the whole Union, a subordinate one to my State," and denounced the
treasonable utterances of Mr. Rhett, was altogether inimitable and unsurpassed.  In the same
speech he showed as little quarter to the Abolitionists.  Turning to Mr. Hale, he said, "They
live by agitation.  It is their meat, their bread, the air which they breathe; and if they
saw in its incipient state, a measure giving them more of that food, and meat, and bread, and
air, do you believe they would oppose themselves to its adoption?  Do you not believe that
they would hail [Hale] it as a blessing? * * * They see their doom as certain as there is a
God in heaven, who sends his providential dispensations to calm the threatening storm, and
to tranquilize agitated men.  As certain as God exists in heaven, your business, your vocation,
is gone."  His devotion to the Union was his ruling passion, and in one of his numerous speeches
during this session he held up a fragment of Washington's coffin, and with much dramatic effect
pleaded for reconciliation and peace between the warring sections.

His scheme of compromise, or "omnibus bill," was the darling child of his political ambition
and old age; and when, after lovingly nursing it and gallantly fighting for it through seven
or eight weary months, he saw it cruelly dismembered on July 31st, and his sovereign remedy
for our national troubles insulted by the separate passage of the bill providing a Territorial
Government for Utah, I could not help feeling a profound personal sympathy with him. Beaten
at last on every point, deserted by some senators in whom he had trusted implicitly, crushed
and exhausted by labors which few young and vigorous men could have endured, he bowed to the
inevitable, and retired from the Senate Chamber.  But in the next morning, prior to his departure
for the sea-shore, he was in his seat; and with lightning in his eye, and figure erect as ever,
he paid his respects to the men whose work of political havoc he deplored.  His impassioned
arraignment of the disunionists was loudly applauded by the galleries, and clearly indicated
the part he would have played in the late Rebellion had his life been spared to witness that
direful event.  "So long," said he, "as it pleases God to give me a voice to express my sentiments,
or an arm, weak and enfeebled as it may be by age, that voice and that arm will be on the side
of my country, for the support of the general authority, and for the maintenance of the powers
of this Union."

I heard the famous "Seventh of March Speech" of Mr. Webster.  To me his oratory was a perfect
surprise and curiosity.  He not only spoke with very unusual deliberation, but with pauses
having no relation whatever to the sense.  His sentences were broken into the oddest fragments,
and the hearer was perplexed in the endeavor to gather his meaning.  In declaring, for example,
that he "would put in no Wilmot proviso for the purpose of a taunt," etc., he made a long pause
at "Wilmot," perhaps half a minute, and finally, having apparently recovered his breath, added
the word "proviso"; and then, after another considerable pause, went on with his sentence.
His speaking seemed painfully laborious.  Great drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead
and face, notwithstanding the slowness of his utterance, suggesting, as a possible explanation,
a very recent and heavy dinner, or a greatly troubled conscience over his final act of apostasy
from his early New England faith.  The latter was probably the truth, since he is known to
have long and seriously pondered the question of his ultimate decision; and with his naturally
great and noble traits of character he could not have announced it without manifest tokens
of uneasiness.  I was greatly interested in the brief dialogue between him and Mr. Calhoun,
which followed this speech.  Reference was made to their famous passage- at-arms twenty years
before; and Mr. Calhoun, while taking exception to some of Mr. Webster's positions, congratulated
him on his strong deliverance in the interest of slavery.  The great Carolinian was then wrestling
with the disease which soon afterward terminated his life, and was thin, pale, and feeble of
step; but his singularly intellectual face, and the peculiar light which flashed from his eye
while speaking, made him the most strikingly picturesque figure in the Senate.  No man can
compute the evils wrought by his political theories; but in private life he was thoroughly
upright and pure, and no suspicion of political jobbery was ever whispered in connection with
his name.  In his social relations he was most genial and kindly, while he always welcomed
the society of young men who sought the aid of his friendly counsel.  Politically, he has been
singularly misunderstood.  He was not, as has been so generally thought, a disunionist.  He
was the champion of State Sovereignty, but he believed that this was the sure basis and bond
of Union.  He thought the right of State nullification, if recognized, would hold the central
power in check, and thus cement the Union; while his devotion to African slavery as a defensible
form of society, and a solution of the conflict between capital and labor, was doubtless as
sincere as it was fanciful.

During the first months of this session my spare time was devoted to the preparation of a speech
on the slavery question.  My constituents expected this, and so did my anti-slavery and Free
Soil friends generally.  It was my darling purpose, and I resolved to do my best upon it. 
I not only meant that they should not be ashamed of it, but that, if possible, it should stand
the test of criticism, both as to matter and diction.  I re-examined the question in its various
aspects, and more thoroughly than I had been able to do before, giving special attention to
the speeches of Southern members in both Houses, and carefully noting their vulnerable points.
I overhauled the question of "Northern aggression" pretty thoroughly, and endeavored to expose
the absurdity of that complaint, while crowding into my task such facts and arguments as would
help educate the people in right thinking.  I had my task completed in March, and now anxiously
waited the opportunity for its delivery. I was very curious to know how it would sound, and
what would be thought of it, while my constitutional self-distrust made me dread the experiment
unspeakably.  My scuffle for the floor was a sore trial of patience, and it was not until the
fourteenth of May that the competitive contest was ended.  I got through with the work better
than I anticipated, was handsomely listened to, and went home in triumph.  A great burden of
anxiety had been lifted, while I received letters from the leading Abolitionists of New England
and elsewhere, very cordially complimenting the speech, which was copied into the principal
anti-slavery newspapers, and quite favorably noticed.  I was flattered beyond measure, and
found my self-esteem germinating into new life under these fertilizing dews.

CHAPTER V. REMINISCENCES OF THE THIRTY-FIRST CONGRESS (CONTINUED).

I happened to be in the Senate on April 17th, just before the memorable fracas between Foote,
of Mississippi, and Col. Benton. They had had an unfriendly encounter not long before, and
it was well understood that Benton had made up his mind that Foote should not henceforward
name him or allude to him in debate.  Foote had said:  "I do not denounce him as a coward--such
language is unfitted for this audience--but if he wishes to be blackguarded in the discharge
of his duty, and the culprit go unpunished?  Is language to be used here which would not be
permitted to be used in the lowest pot-house, tavern, or oyster cellar, and for the use of
which he would be turned out of any tavern by a decent landlord?" Benton's wrath had not in
the least cooled since this altercation. Foote was on the floor, and in speaking of the late
"Southern address," referred to Benton in terms which everybody understood. In an indirect
way he became more and more personal as he proceeded. Col. Benton finally arose from his seat
with every appearance of intense passion, and with a quick pace moved toward Foote, who was
addressing the Senate from his desk near the main aisle.  The Vice President demanded "order,"
and several senators tried to hold Benton back, but he broke loose from his keepers, and was
moving rapidly upon his foe.  When he saw Benton nearing him, Foote sprang into the main aisle,
and retreated toward the Vice President, presenting a pistol as he fled, or, as he afterward
expressed it, "advanced backward."  In the meantime Benton had been so obstructed by the sergeant-at-arms
and others that Foote, if disposed to shoot, could not have done so without firing through
the crowd.  But Benton, with several senators hanging to him, now proceeded round the lobby
so as to meet Foote at the opposite side of the Chamber. Tearing himself away from those who
sought to hold him, and throwing open his bosom, he said:  "Let him shoot me!  The cowardly
assassin has come here to shoot me; let him shoot me if he dares!  I never carry arms, and
he knows it; let the assassin fire!"  He was an embodied fury, and raged and raved, the helpless
victim of his passions.  I had never seen such an uproar in a legislative body; but the sergeant-at-arms
at last restored order, when Mr. Clay suggested that both parties should voluntarily enter
into bonds to keep the peace, upon which Benton instantly rose and said:  "I'll rot in jail,
sir, before I will do it!  No, sir!  I'll rot in jail first.  I'll rot, sir!" and he poured
forth a fresh torrent of bitter words upon the man who was then so well known throughout the
Northern States as "Hangman Foote."*  Benton was not only a man of tremendous passion, but
unrivalled as a hater.  Nor did his hatred spend itself entirely upon injustice and meanness.
It was largely personal and unreasoning.  He was pre-eminently unforgiving. He hated Calhoun
with a real vengeance, styling him "John Cataline Calhoun," and branding him as a "coward cur
that sneaked to his kennel when the Master of the Hermitage blew his bugle horn."  He seemed
to relent a little, however, when he saw the life of the great Carolinian rapidly ebbing away,
and on one occasion declared that, "When God lays his hand on a man, I take mine off."  His
wit was sometimes as pungent as his invective.  In his famous speech on the Compromise measures,
he gave Mr. Clay a telling hit by comparing the boasted panacea of his "Omnibus Bill," or "five
old bills tacked together," to "old Dr. Jacob Townsend's sarsaparilla," and contrasting it
with the alleged worthlessness of the same measures when separately proposed, which he likened
to "young Dr. Samuel Townsend's" extract from the same vegetable.  "Sarsaparilla" was thus
more widely advertised than ever before, but it aided the triumph of the "young Dr.," and the
defeat of Mr. Clay's pet scheme.

[* So named because of his declaration in the Senate the year before, that if John P. Hale
would come to Mississippi he would be hung to "one of the tallest trees of the forest," and
that he (Foote) would himself "assist in the operation."]

The sudden death of Gen. Taylor, July 9, 1850, produced a very profound impression.  The shock
to the people of the Northern States was felt the more keenly because of the peculiarly threatening
aspect of public affairs, and of the unexpectedly manly course of the President in withstanding
the imperious and insolent demands of the extreme men of his own section.  Millard Fillmore
then stood well before the country, and was quite as emphatically committed to the growing
anti-slavery sentiment of the Free States as Gov. Seward himself; but he was now to be severely
tried, and no one could tell whether he would be true to the policy of his predecessor in resisting
the ultra demands of the South, or repeat the perfidy of John Tyler by flagrantly turning his
back on his past life. For the time, however, the national bereavement seemed too absorbing
for any political speculations.  The funeral pageant, which took place on the 13th, was very
imposing.  The funeral car was a long- coupled running gear, with wheels carved from solid
blocks of wood. Over this was raised a canopy covered with broadcloth, and surmounted by a
magnificent eagle.  Curtains of black and white silk in alternating festoons hung from the
canopy, with rosettes, fringes, and tassels.  The car was drawn by eight white horses, richly
caparisoned, and led by as many grooms, who were all white men. "Old Whitey," the venerable
war steed of the President, followed immediately behind the remains of his master, and attracted
universal attention.  The procession was accompanied by the tolling of bells, the firing of
heavy ordnance, and plaintive strains of music; and the whole affair exceeded anything of the
kind that had ever taken place in Washington, although the outpouring of the people would bear
no comparison with that of several notable funerals of later years.

The dreadful heat of the summer months, and the monotonous "ding- dong" of the debate on the
Compromise measures, made life dreary enough.  The "rump-session," as it was then called, became
more and more dismal as it dragged its slow length into the fall months. Members grew pale
and thin, and sighed for their homes; but the Congressional mill had to be kept running till
the grists of the slave-power could be got fully ready for the hopper, and ground in their
regular order.  Mr. Clay's Omnibus Bill having gone to pieces, the "five gaping wounds" of
the country, about which he had talked so eloquently, called for treatment in detail; and by
far the most threatening of these was the dispute between Texas and New Mexico. The remedy
was the Texas Boundary Bill, which surrendered a large belt of country to Texas and slavery,
and gave her ten million dollars besides.  It was vehemently opposed in the House, and its
fate seemed to hang in doubt up to the final vote upon it; but its passage was really assured
from the beginning by the corrupt appliances of its friends.  Texas bonds, which were then
worth ten cents on the dollar, would be lifted nearly to par by this measure, and its success
was undoubtedly secured by the bribery of members. The territorial question was disposed of
by the legislative covenant that new States might be admitted from our Mexican acquisitions,
either with or without slavery, as their people might determine. This was not only an open
abandonment of the Wilmot proviso, but a legislative condemnation of the Missouri compromise
line, as a violation of the principle of "popular sovereignty," and was sure to breed the mischiefs
which followed four years later.  But of the several compromise or "healing measures" of this
session, the Fugitive Slave Bill was by far the most atrocious.  It made the ex parte interested
oath of the slave-hunter final and conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and of the identity
of the party pursued, while the simplest duties of humanity were punished as felonies by fine
and imprisonment.  The method of its enactment perfectly accorded with its character.  It was
reached on the Speaker's table on September 12th, and on motion of Mr. Thompson, of Pennsylvania,
who served as the parliamentary hangman of his employers, the previous question was seconded
on its passage; and thus, without reference to any committee, without even being printed, and
with no opportunity whatever for debate, it became a law.  It is needless to say that these
pretended measures of final adjustment paved the way for the repeal of the Missouri restriction,
the bloody raid into Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and the final chapter of the Civil War;
while they completely vindicated the little party of Independents in this Congress in standing
aloof from the Whig and Democratic organizations, and warning the country against further submission
to their rule.  One hundred guns were fired in Washington over the final triumph of slavery
in this memorable struggle; and Congress adjourned, at last, on September 30th, the session
having lasted nearly ten months, and being considerably the longest thus far since the formation
of the Government.

The adjournment was followed by great "Union-saving" meetings throughout the country, which
denounced "abolitionism" in the severest terms, and endorsed the action of Congress.  Multitudes
of "lower law" sermons by conservative Doctors of Divinity were scattered over the Northern
States through the mails, and a regular system of agitation to suppress agitation was inaugurated.
The sickly air of compromise filled the land, and for a time the deluded masses were made to
believe that the Free Soilers had brought the country to the verge of ruin.  Both clergy and
laity zealously dedicated themselves to the great work of sectional pacification. The labors
of Dr. Nehemiah Adams and Dr. Lord in this direction will not be forgotten.  The Rev. Moses
Stuart, of Andover Theological Seminary, in a work in the interest of peace, spoke of the "blessings
and comforts" of slavery, and declared that "Christ doubtless felt that slavery might be made
a very tolerable condition--aye, even a blessing, to such as were shiftless and helpless."
Another book, entitled "Aunt Phillis's Cabin; or Southern Life as it is," was issued from the
press, in which it was said that slavery was "authorized by God, permitted by Jesus Christ,
sanctioned by the Apostles, and maintained by good men in all ages."  A very remarkable book
made its appearance, entitled "A Choice of Evils; or Thirteen Years in the South.  By a Northern
man."  Its author was a Mr. Hooker, of Philadelphia.  In this work he announced the discovery
that slavery is not only an unspeakable blessing, but a great "missionary institution for the
conversion of the heathen."  One of the chapters of this book is on "The Pleasures of Slavery."
He declared that the Southern slave is not merely contented, but a "joyous fellow"; and that
"in willing and faithful subjection to a benignant and protecting power, and that visible to
his senses, he leans upon it in complete and sure confidence, as a trusting child holds on
to the hand of his Father, and passes joyously along the thronged and jostling way, where he
would not dare to be left alone."  Mr. Hooker declared that "his are the thoughts that make
glad the cared-for child, led by paternal hand"; and that "of all the people in the world,
the pleasures of the Southern slaves seem, as they really are, most unalloyed."  The press
teemed with kindred publications, while "Graham's Magazine," Harper's "Journal of Civilization,"
the "Literary World," "Godey's Ladies' Book," and other periodicals, joined in the united effort
to shout the anti- slavery agitation into silence.

During this session some laws were passed having no connection with the slavery question, which
were pregnant with very great mischief, and have only yielded up their meaning as they have
been practically applied and extended.  The act of September 28th, granting land bounties to
the soldiers of the Mexican war, opened the way for the monopoly of many millions of acres
of the public domain by sharks and speculators, while proving a wretched mockery of the just
claims of the men in whose name it was urged.  The Swamp Land Act of the same date, owing to
its loose and unguarded provisions and shameful mal-administration, has been still more fruitful
of wide-spread spoilation and plunder.  The act of September 20th, granting alternate sections
of land in aid of the Illinois Central Railway, inaugurated our famous land-grant policy, which,
becoming more and more reckless and improvident in its exactions, and cunningly combining the
power of great corporations with vast monopolies of the public domain, has signally eclipsed
all other schemes of commercial feudalism, and left to coming generations a problem involving
the very life of our popular institutions.  The fruits of this legislation were not foreseen
at the time, but the legislation itself fitly belongs to the extraordinary work of this Congress.

The events of this session formed a new band of union among anti- slavery men everywhere, and
naturally strengthened the wish I had long cherished to meet some of the famous people with
whose names I had been most familiar.  Accordingly, I paid a visit to James and Lucretia Mott
in Philadelphia, which I greatly enjoyed, meeting there Dr. Elder, J. Miller McKim, Dr. Furness,
and other well known friends of freedom.  Oddly enough, I was invited to dine with Judge Kane,
then conspicuous through his remarkable rulings in fugitive slave cases, and I found his manners
and hospitality as charming as his opinions about slavery were detestable.  From Philadelphia
I went to Boston, and attended the Free Soil State Convention which met there early in October,
1850, where Sumner and Burlingame were the principal speakers.  The latter was extremely boyish
in appearance, but was counted a marvel in native eloquence.  Mr. Sumner was then comparatively
a young man, apparently somewhat fastidious, with a winning face, commanding figure, and a
voice singularly musical.  At this time he was only famous through his orations, and I think
knew relatively little of American life and society outside of Boston and his books.  He told
me he had recently been lecturing at several points out of the city, and had been delighted
to find the people so intelligent and so capable of understanding him.  He seemed much surprised
when I told him how many admirers he had in Indiana, and I found that others shared his unflattering
impressions respecting the general intelligence of the West.  At this convention I met Dr.
Palfrey, then actively interested in anti-slavery politics, and Charles Francis Adams, the
Free Soil nominee for Vice President in 1848, with whom I dined at the old Adams mansion in
Quincy a few days later.  I enjoyed the honor of a call from Theodore Parker while in the city,
but failed to meet Mr. Garrison, who was absent.  At the "Liberator" office, however, I met
Stephen S. Foster, who entertained me with his views on "non-resistance."  I attended a spirited
anti-fugitive- slave-law meeting in Lynn, where I first met Wendell Phillips, and enjoyed the
long-coveted pleasure of hearing him speak.  The music of his voice so charmed me that I became
completely his captive. From Boston I went to Worcester, and after a delightful visit with
my excellent friend, Judge Allen, returned to my home in the West.

After a vacation of two months, the work of the Thirty-first Congress was resumed at the opening
of its second session.  Members returned so refreshed and invigorated that they did not appear
like the same men.  All parties seemed more friendly, but the agitation of the slavery question
had not been suppressed.  Thousands of fugitive slaves had fled to Canada or to remote sections
of the Northern States, through the fear of recapture under the harsh features of the new Fugitive
Slave Act.  The method of enforcing it in different States, involving the intervention of the
army and navy, had stirred the blood of thousands who had else remained unmoved by the slavery
issue.  The effort of the National Government to make the harboring of a fugitive constructive
treason, was the farthest thing possible from a peace-offering to the Abolitionists, but the
friends of the Compromise measures failed to see that their scheme had proved entirely abortive,
and made one further effort to silence the voice of humanity.  The signature of Henry Clay
was the first on this document, and was followed by those of various prominent men of the free
and slave States, and of different political parties.  But the extreme men of the South and
most of the moderate men of the North refused to assume this obligation, while the Free Soilers
felt perfectly sure that their cause would be advanced by the very measures which had been
taken to defeat it.  In this they were not mistaken.  "Uncle Tom's Cabin," born of the Fugitive
Slave Act, was then making its first appearance in weekly numbers of Dr. Bailey's "National
Era."  Hildreth's "White Slave" and Sumner's "White Slavery in the Barbary States" were widely
circulated, and exerted a powerful influence.  The writings of Judge Jay and William Goodell
on the slavery question found more readers than ever before, while the pro-slavery literature
and "south side" theology, already referred to, called forth replies from various writers,
and contributed largely to the general ferment which the friends of the Compromise measures
were so anxious to tranquilize.  Indeed, while the champions of slavery were exerting themselves
as never before to stifle the anti-slavery spirit of the free States, the Abolitionists were
delighted with the tokens of progress which everywhere saluted their vision and animated them
with new courage and hope.

It was early in the first session of this Congress that several members of the House introduced
bills providing homesteads of one hundred and sixty acres each to actual landless settlers,
without cost, on prescribed conditions of occupancy and improvement.  The first of these bills
in the order of time was that of Andrew Johnson, which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture,
and subsequently reported favorably, and debated at different times.  Similar propositions
were offered in the Senate by Mr. Webster, and by Senator Walker, of Wisconsin.  The fact is
also worthy of note, that Horace Greeley, during his short term of service in the previous
Congress, had offered a bill giving landless men the right to pre- empt one hundred and sixty
acres for seven years, and, on condition of occupancy and improvement, the "right of unlimited
occupancy" to forty acres of the same, without price, by a single man, or eighty acres by the
married head of a family.  But the legislative initiation of the Homestead law, substantially
as we now have it, belongs to the House of Representatives of the Thirty-first Congress, and
its policy was borrowed from the Free Soil platform of 1848 and the Land Reformers of New York.
This measure completely reversed the early policy of the Government, when settlers on the public
lands were dealt with as trespassers, while its triumph, years afterward, marked an epoch in
our legislation, and has done more to make the American name honored and loved at home and
abroad than any single enactment since the year 1789.  Having earnestly espoused this policy
years before, I sought the acquaintance of Mr. Johnson for the purpose of co-operating with
him in urging it, and found him its sincere friend.  Although loyal to his party, he seemed
to have little sympathy with the extreme men among its leaders, and no unfriendliness to me
on account of my decided anti-slavery opinions.  When my homestead speech was ready for delivery,
although the slave-holders hated its doctrines as heartily as they hated "abolitionism" itself,
and it was through his friendly tactics that I finally obtained the floor, in opposition to
the earnest wish and determined purpose of Speaker Cobb.

Near the close of this session, at the instance of Charles Allen, of Massachusetts, a man of
real ability and stainless life, a preamble and resolutions were offered by myself calling
for a committee to inquire into the alleged corrupt conduct of Daniel Webster in accepting
the office of Secretary of State as the stipendary of Eastern capitalists.  On the motion to
suspend the rules to allow this to be done, the yeas were only thirty-five; but this vote was
quite as large as could have been expected, considering the excellent standing of Mr. Webster
at that time with the pro-slavery sentiment of the country.  I think it is not doubted that,
being then poor, he accepted office, as he had done before, on condition of pecuniary indemnity
by his rich friends in Wall street and State street; but in the light of the far greater immoralities
and profligacies of later times, it now seems a relatively small matter.

Political morality was at a very low ebb during the period covered by the Thirty-first Congress.
The Whigs, now that they were in power, saw nothing amiss in the spoils system inaugurated
by Gen. Jackson, which was in full blast.  The President had declared that he had "no friends
to reward and no enemies to punish," but under the party pressure he totally lost sight of
these words, and seemed almost as powerless to withstand it as did Gen. Grant in later years.
Thousands of officials were turned adrift for no other than party reasons, while political
nepotism was the order of the day. Under the brief administration of Gen. Taylor, unprecedented
political jobbery prevailed, both in the legislative and executive departments of the Government,
and these evils seemed to be aggravated by the accession of Mr. Fillmore, and to gather strength
as the spirit of liberty declined.  Nor was the personal morality of members more to be commended
than their political.  The vice of intemperance was not, as now, restricted to a few exceptional
cases, but was fearfully prevalent.  A glass of wine could sometimes be seen on the desk of
a senator while engaged in debate, and the free use of intoxicating drinks by senators was
too common to provoke remark.  It was still more common in the House; and the scenes of drunkenness
and disorder in that body on the last night of the last session beggared description.  Much
of the most important legislation of the session, involving the expenditure of many millions,
remained to be disposed of at that sitting; and, as a preparation for the work, a large supply
of whisky had been deposited in a room immediately connected with the Hall of Representatives,
which was thronged by members at all hours of the night.  The chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee became so exhilarated that he had to be retired from his post; and some of his brethren,
who had been calling him to order in a most disorderly manner, were quite as incapable of business
as himself, while order had sought her worshipers elsewhere.  The exhibition was most humiliating,
but it now pleasantly reminds us of the wonderful changes which have been wrought by thirty years.

In this Congress, the men who afterward became the chief leaders of the Rebellion were conspicuous,
and foreshadowed their future course.  Jefferson Davis had a military and magisterial look.
His estimate of himself was so exalted that his ordinary demeanor toward others seemed like
a personal condescension, if not an insinuation of contempt.  One of the most striking personalities
in the Senate was A. P. Butler, the colleague of Mr. Calhoun, and uncle of Preston S. Brooks,
of infamous memory.  His robust physique, florid complexion, sparkling eye, heavy bushy suit
of snow-white hair, and a certain indefinable expression of mischievous audacity, made him
a very attractive figure.  In his eulogy upon Calhoun he marred the solemnity of the occasion
by pronouncing the world "always" as if written "allers," and by kindred evidences of "life
among the lowly."  The wit of John P. Hale was effective and unfailing, and gave him a decided
advantage over Mr. Chase, who had nothing but his dignity and power of argument with which
to confront the tremendous odds against him.  This was happily illustrated early in the first
session of this Congress, in his reply to Mr. Clemens, of Alabama, who, in a furious tirade
against the Abolitionists, had pronounced the Union dissolved already.  "There are many timid
people at the North," said Hale, "who have looked forward with excited nerves and trembling
fears at the 'wreck of matter and the crush of worlds' which they believed would be the result
of the dissolution of this Union.  I think they will be exceedingly quiet now, when they find
it has already taken place and they did not know it, for the honorable senator from Alabama
tells us it is already dissolved.

Some of the finest of Mr. Seward's speeches were delivered during the first session of this
Congress, but in the same husky voice which marked his later efforts.  Decidedly the finest
looking man in the Senate was General Shields, of Illinois, then in his prime, and crowned
with the laurels he had won in the Mexican War.  The appearance of Mr. Douglas, familiarly
known as the "little giant," was in striking contrast with that of his colleague.  He cared
nothing about dignity and refinement, and had a slovenly and "unwashed" appearance.  The towering
and erect form of General Houston always commanded attention in the Senate, and he added to
his attractiveness by wearing an old-fashioned knit cap, and always devoting a portion of his
time to whittling a pine board.  The most fascinating member of the Senate was Soule, of Louisiana.
There was a tropical charm about his oratory, which was heightened by his foreign accent and
his singularly striking presence and physiognomy.  Winthrop was the most accomplished gentleman
in the House.  Edward D. Baker, since so famous, was a member from Illinois, but made no mark.
Stephens, of Georgia, looked like a corpse, but his clear and ringing voice always commanded
attention, and his words went directly to the mark.  Toombs was recognized as a leader of Southern
opinion, but disfigured his speeches by his swagger and defiance.  Among the notable men from
the Northern States, Hannibal Hamlin, lately retired from public life, was in the Senate. He
was then a young man, erect, fine looking, a thorough Democrat, but not the tool of slavery.
Thaddeus Stevens was in the House, and just at the beginning of his remarkable congressional
life; but the slave power, then in full sweep of its despotism, took good care to keep him
in the background in the organization of the committees.  He made several speeches, in which
he displayed his rare powers of invective, irony, and sarcasm, in dealing with the Southern
leaders; and no one who listened to his speech of Feb. 20, 1850, could ever forget his withering
reply to Mr. Mead, of Virginia, who had argued against the prohibition of slavery in the Territories
because it would conflict with the interests of Virginia as a breeder of slaves.  I quote the
following:

"Let us pause for a moment over this humiliating confession.  In plain English, what does it
mean?  That Virginia is now only fit to be the breeder, not the employer, of slaves!  That
she is reduced to the condition that her proud chivalry are compelled to turn slave-traders
for a livelihood!  Instead of attempting to renovate the soil, and by their own honest labor
compelling the earth to yield her abundance; instead of seeking for the best breed of cattle
and horses to feed on her hills and valleys, and fertilize the land, the sons of that great
State must devote their time to selecting and grooming the most lusty sires and the most fruitful
wenches, to supply the slave barracoons of the South!  And the learned gentleman pathetically
laments that the profits of this genteel traffic will be greatly lessened by the circumscription
of slavery!  This is his picture, not mine."

Mr. Stevens was equally merciless in dealing with the tribe of "dough-faces."  This was illustrated
in a speech later in the session, in which he alluded to his colleague from Bucks County, Mr.
Ross, who had attacked him in a violent pro-slavery harangue:

"There is," said Mr. Stevens, "in the natural world, a little, spotted, contemptible animal,
which is armed by nature with a fetid, volatile, penetrating virus, which so pollutes whoever
attacks it as to make him offensive to himself and all around him for a long time.  Indeed,
he is almost incapable of purification.  Nothing, sir, no insult, shall provoke me to crush
so filthy a beast."  As these words were being uttered, Mr. Ross was seen precipitately making
his way out of the hall under the return fire of his foe. But Mr. Stevens then gave no clear
promise of the wonderful career as a parliamentary leader which awaited him in later years,
when perfectly unshackled by the power that at first held him in check.

The Thirty-first Congress was not alone remarkable for the great questions it confronted and
its shameless recreancy to humanity and justice; it was equally remarkable for its able and
eminent men.  In the Senate, the great triumvirate of Webster, Clay, and Calhoun, appeared
in public life for the last time.  With them were associated Benton, Cass, Douglas, Seward,
Chase, Bell, Berrien, Soule, Davis of Mississippi, Dayton, Hale, Ewing, Corwin, Hamlin, Butler,
Houston, and Mason.  In the House were Thaddeus Stevens, Winthrop, Ashmun, Allen, Cobb of Georgia,
McDowell, Giddings, Preston King, Horace Mann, Marshall, Orr, Schenck, Stanley, Toombs, Alexander
H. Stephens, and Vinton.  If mere talent could have supplemented the lack of conscience, the
slave power might have been overborne in 1850, and the current of American history turned into
the channels of liberty and peace.  But the better days of the Republic, when high integrity
and unselfish devotion to the country inspired our statesmen, were past, and we had entered
upon the era of mean ambitions and huckstering politics.  "The bulk of the nation," as Harriet
Martineau said, a little later, "was below its institutions," and our fathers "had laid down
a loftier program than their successors were able to fulfill."  It was not strange, therefore,
that the little band of Free Soilers in this Congress encountered popular obloquy and social
outlawry at the Capital. Their position was offensive, because it rebuked the ruling influences
of the times, and summoned the real manhood of the country to its rescue.  They were treated
as pestilent fanatics because they bravely held up the ideal of the Republic, and sought to
make it real.  But they pressed forward along the path of their aspirations. They found a solace
for their social ostracism in delightful gatherings which assembled weekly at the residence
of Dr. Bailey, where they met philanthropists, reformers, and literary notables. They had the
courage of their opinions, and the genuine satisfaction which accompanies manliness of character;
and they lived to see their principles vindicated, and the political and social tables turned
upon the men who had honored them by their scorn and contempt. The anti-slavery revolt of 1848,
which they represented, saved Oregon from slavery, made California a free State, and launched
the policy of free homes on the public domain which finally prevailed in 1862; and it was the
prophecy and parent of the larger movement which rallied under Fremont in 1856, elected Lincoln
in 1860, and played its grand part in saving the nation from destruction by the armed insurgents
whom it had vanquished at the ballot-box.  This will be the sure award of history; but history
will find another parentage for the party despotism and political corruption which have since
disgraced the administration of the Government.

The reaction which followed the passage of the compromise acts of 1850 was quite as remarkable
as the anti-slavery revolt of 1848, which frightened the champions of slavery into the espousal
of these desperate measures.  Immense meetings were held in Philadelphia, New York, Boston,
and other cities and towns throughout the country, in which leading Whigs and Democrats united
in pledging themselves to make the suppression of abolitionism paramount to any question of
party allegiance.  These demonstrations were vigorously seconded by leading clergymen and doctors
of divinity, whose sermons were plentifully scattered over the land under the frank of members
of Congress and otherwise.  The press put forth its whole power on the side of anti-slavery
submission and peace, while the Executive and Judicial departments of the Government made haste
to abase themselves by their super-serviceable zeal in the enforcement of the new Fugitive
Slave law.  The tables seemed to be completely turned, and the time-honored rule of our slave-masters
impregnably re-established.  The anti-slavery commotion which a little while before had rocked
the country from one end of the Union to the other was hushed in the restored order which succeeded,
and gave promise of that longed-for "finality" for which the two great parties had so ardently
labored.

In no section of the non-slaveholding States was this reaction more strikingly felt than in
the West, and especially in Illinois and Indiana.  These States were outlying provinces of
the empire of slavery.  Their black codes and large Southern population bore witness to their
perfect loyalty to slave-holding traditions. Indiana, while a Territory, had repeatedly sought
the introduction of slavery into her borders.  Her black laws had disfigured her legislation
from the beginning, and in 1850 were made still blacker by her new Constitution, the 13th article
of which, forbidding negroes from coming into the State and white men from encouraging them
to remain, was submitted to the people separately, and ratified by a popular majority of nearly
ninety thousand votes.  Ten years before, in the Harrison campaign, Mr. Bigger, the Whig candidate
for Governor, made himself very popular by proving that Van Buren had favored negro suffrage
in New York.  In 1842, four of the Indiana delegation in Congress--namely, Lane, Wallace, Thompson,
and Kennedy--voted for the censure of Mr. Giddings, which Mr. Clay indignantly denounced at
the time, and two only--namely, White and Cravens--voted in the negative.  Although the execution
of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was a matter of Federal cognizance exclusively, yet the State
code made the harboring of a fugitive an offense against its peace and dignity, punishable
by fine and imprisonment.  The colored people were denied any share in the school fund, but
were taxed for its support; and under the law forbidding them to testify in cases where white
men were parties, they were at the mercy of any white villain who might take the precaution
of perpetrate an outrage upon them in the absence of white witnesses.  Of course, the organization
of an anti-slavery party strong enough to rule such States as these, was to be the work of
time, toil, and patience.  It was only possible to lay the foundation, and build as the material
could be commanded; but the Free Soilers, whether in the east or in the West, were undismayed
by the crisis, and fully resolved upon keeping up the fight.  In compliance with the wishes
of my anti-slavery friends, and by way of doing my part in the work, I decided to stand for
a re-election from the Fourth Indiana District in the spring of 1851.  The Wilmot proviso Democrats
who had been chosen with me two years before on the strength of their Free Soil pledges, including
such men as Joseph E. McDonald and Graham N. Fitch, now stood squarely on the Compromise measures.

The Whigs of the State, following the lead of Webster and Clay, and including Edward W. McGaughey,
their only delegate in Congress, had also completely changed their base.  My competitor, Samuel
W. Parker, whom I had defeated two years before, and who had then insisted that the Whigs were
better anti-slavery men than the Free Soilers themselves, now made a complete somersault, fully
committing himself to the Compromise acts, and especially the Fugitive Slave law, which he
declared he approved without changing the dotting of an i or the crossing of a t.  Foote, Cass,
and Webster were now the oracles of the Whig faith; but, oddly enough, the Democrats, who had
formed by far the larger portion of my support two years before, now stood firm, and I would
undoubtedly have been re-elected but for very vigorous outside interference.  Wm. J. Brown,
who had intrigued with the leading Free Soilers for the Speakership in 1849, as I have already
shown, and favored the passage of the Wilmot proviso in order to "stick it at old Zach," was
now the editor of the "Sentinel," the State organ of the Democracy, which was sufficiently
orthodox on the slavery question to pass muster in South Carolina.  It was this organ which
afterward insisted that my abolitionism entitled me to at least five years service at hard
labor in the penitentiary.  Mr. Brown's dread of this fearful heresy seemed as intense as it
was unbounded, and he resolved at all hazards to avert any further alliance with it by Democrats
in any portion of the State.  By very hard work and the most unscrupulous expedients he succeeded
in enlisting a few ambitious local magnates of his party in the district, who were fully in
sympathy with his spirit and aims, and of whom Oliver P. Morton was the chief; and by thus
drawing away from the democracy from two to three hundred pro-slavery malcontents and turning
them over to my Whig competitor, my defeat was accomplished.

But the effort to stem the tide of slavery fared better elsewhere. While Mr. Webster was publicly
ridiculing the "higher law," and blurting his contempt upon one of the noted anti-slavery strongholds
of the country as "a laboratory of abolitionism, libel, and treason," Massachusetts sent Charles
Sumner to the Senate of the United States, and elected Horace Mann, Charles Allen and Robert
Rantoul as members of the House.  Amos Tuck was returned from New Hampshire, Preston King from
New York, Thaddeus Stevens and John W. Howe from Pennsylvania, Charles Durkee from Wisconsin,
and Giddings and Townsend from Ohio.  These events were exceedingly gratifying, and lent new
life to the cause throughout the Northern States.  During the summer of this year Mr. Sumner
moved the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act, and although it received but ten votes, it led
to an angry and protracted discussion, which showed how signally the attempt to suppress anti-slavery
agitation had failed.  In the latter part of September of this year a Free Soil National Convention
met at Cleveland, to take into consideration the state of the country and the duty of anti-slavery
men.  It was large and enthusiastic. It adopted a series of spirited resolutions and a timely
public address, and admirable speeches were made by Cassius M. Clay, Joshua R. Giddings, Samuel
Lewis, George Bradburn, and others.  The only drawback to the prevailing spirit of hopefulness
and courage was the absence of Mr. Chase, who had just withdrawn from the Free Soil party and
united his fortunes with the Democrats of Ohio, who had adopted a platform which admitted an
interpretation covering, substantially, the principles of the Free Soil creed.

As the time for another Presidential election drew near, Whigs and Democrats were alike engrossed
with the consideration of their "final settlement" of the slavery question, and their attitude
respecting it in the impending struggle.  Among the latter there was substantially no division.
Their experience in 1848 with Gen. Cass and his "Nicholson letter," had convinced them that
nothing was to be gained by mincing matters, and that a hearty, complete and unhesitating surrender
to slavery was the surest means of success.  The Democrats in Congress, both North and South,
had very generally favored this "settlement," and there was now no division in the party except
as to men.  The candidates were Cass, Buchanan, Douglas, and Marcy; and the National Convention
assembled on the first of June.  So far as slavery was concerned it thus became a recognized
and authoritative principle of American Democracy to muzzle the press and crush out the freedom
of speech, as the means of upholding and perpetuating its power. It is difficult to conceive
of any words by which he could more completely have abdicated his manhood and self-respect,
and sounded the knell of his own conscience.  There was no lower deep, and he was evidently
the right man in the right place.

The Whig National Convention assembled on the sixteenth of June, with Scott, Fillmore and Webster
as the candidates.  There was yet a considerable anti-slavery element in the party, but it
was paralyzed and powerless.  It had made a fatal mistake in submitting to the nomination of
Gen. Taylor, and became still more completely demoralized by the accession of Fillmore, who
turned his back upon his past life, and threw himself into the arms of the slave-holders. The
old party had gone astray too long and too far to return, and now determined to seek its fortunes
in the desperate effort to outdo the Democrats in cringing servility to the South.  The platform
of the Convention expressed the reliance of the Whigs "upon the intelligence of the American
people," but in its eighth resolution declared their acquiescence in the Compromise Acts of
1850 "as a final settlement, in principle and substance, of the subjects to which they relate";
and it deprecated "all further agitation of the questions thus settled, as dangerous to our
peace," and pledged the party "to discountenance all efforts to continue or renew such agitation,
whenever, wherever, or however made."  On this platform, which is well understood to have been
the work of Mr. Webster, Gen. Scott was nominated on the fifty-ninth ballot by a vote of two
hundred and twenty-seven to sixty-six, while the highest vote received by Mr. Webster was twenty-nine.
Here at last, the Whig party had made a complete surrender of its integrity, and verified all
that had ever been said by Free Soilers as to its treachery to freedom; and here, finally,
these rival parties were tumbled together into the ditch of slavery, and wallowing in the mire
of their degradation and shame.  The only issue of the canvass was slavery, and on this they
were perfectly agreed, while each, for the sake of the spoils of office, was trying to surpass
the other in the damning proofs of its treason to humanity and contempt for the fundamental
truths of republican government.

The spectacle was most pitiably humiliating, but I counted it an omen of progress.  The old
parties were now unequivocally committed to the policy of nationalizing the sectional interest
of slavery, and the way thus opened for a fair fight.  The lines were clearly drawn, and the
issue unmistakably made between freedom and free speech on the one side, and slavery and the
gag on the other.  I thought we should have no more anti-slavery professions from Whigs and
Democrats, no further courting of Free-Soilers, and no more mutual upbraidings of servility
to the South; and that thus the way would be smoothed for intelligent and effective anti-slavery
work.

The Free Soil National Convention met in Pittsburg on the eleventh of August, and I believe
an assemblage of purer men never convened for any political purpose.  All the compromising
and trading elements that had drifted into the movement in 1848 had now gravitated back to
the old parties, leaving a residuum of permanent adherents of the cause, who were perfectly
ready to brave the frowns of public opinion and the proscription and wrath of the old parties.
Henry Wilson was made president of the convention, and the platform adopted was substantially
that of 1848.  A few additional resolves, however, were added, including the declaration "that
emigrants and exiles from the old world should find a cordial welcome to homes of comfort and
fields of enterprise in the new," and that "every attempt to abridge their privilege of becoming
citizens and owners of the soil among us ought to be resisted with inflexible determination."
It was also declared "that the Free Democratic party was not organized to aid either the Whig
or Democratic wing of the great Slave Compromise party of the Nation, but to defeat them both;
and that, repudiating and renouncing both as hopelessly corrupt and utterly unworthy of confidence,
the purpose of the Free Democracy is to take possession of the Federal Government, and administer
it for the better protection of the rights and interests of the whole people."  On this platform
John P. Hale was nominated for the Presidency.  My own nomination for the second place on the
ticket was to me a complete surprise.  I fully expected this honor would fall upon Samuel Lewis,
of Ohio, and the delegation from my own State was unitedly for him.  He coveted the nomination,
and so did his many devoted friends, simply as a fitting recognition of his faithful service
in the cause of freedom, to which he had been unselfishly devoted since the year 1841.  He
had made himself a public benefactor by his long and powerful championship of the cause of
education in Ohio.  He was a man of brains, and enthusiastically devoted to every work of practical
philanthropy and reform.  As an impassioned, eloquent, and effective popular orator, he had
no equal in the country.  His profound earnestness, perfect sincerity, and religious fervor
conquered all hearts, and made his anti-slavery appeals irresistible.  He was a strong and
brave old man, who richly deserved whatever distinction his nomination could confer; but for
reasons unknown to me he encountered in the convention the formidable opposition of Mr. Chase,
and he wrote me very touchingly a few days afterward that "among the thousands who have given
their lives and fortunes to this cause, my name will be forgotten, while those who have coolly
stood by and watched the signs of the times, and filled their sails with the wind that others
have raised, will go down to history as heroes and martyrs in a cause for which they never
fought a battle nor suffered a sacrifice."

The canvass of the Whigs was totally without heart or enthusiasm. The Southern wing of the
party had dictated the platform, but did not like Gen. Scott.  Stephens and Toombs, of Georgia,
and Jones and Gentry, of Tennessee, refused to support him.  The Northern Whigs were greatly
embarrassed, and while they felt constrained to support the candidate, tried to relieve their
consciences by "spitting upon the platform" on which he stood.  Mr. Webster did not disguise
his hostility to the ticket, and predicted the speedy dissolution of the party.  The Democrats
were united in this contest. Notwithstanding their atrocious platform they succeeded in persuading
the leading Barnburners of 1848 to return to the party and muster again in the army of slavery.
Dix, the Van Burens, David Dudley Field, Tilden, and a host of others, including even Robert
Rantoul and Preston King, were now fighting for Pierce, while Bryant's "Evening Post" and Greeley's
"Tribune" cravenly submitted to the shackles of slavery.  In the light of such facts as these
it was easy to forecast the result of the contest.

The real enthusiasm of this campaign was in the ranks of the Free Soilers.  They had, of course,
no dream of success, or even of carrying a single electoral vote; but they were profoundly
in earnest, and united as one man against the combination of the old parties in behalf of slavery.
I took the stump, and early in the campaign accepted an invitation to join Cassius M. Clay
in the canvass of the counties of Lewis, Bracken, and Mason, in Kentucky. On my way to our
first appointment I stopped at Maysville, where I found myself in the midst of a considerable
excitement about some thirty or forty slaves who had just crossed the Ohio on their way to
Canada.  I met Mr. Clay at the residence of the Rev. John G. Fee, some eight miles distant
in Lewis county, where we talked over the plan of our campaign.  Mr. Fee was the founder of
an anti- slavery colony, a free school, and a free church, in that region, and was a scholar,
philanthropist, and reformer.  His whole heart was in the anti-slavery cause, and his courage
had never failed him in facing the ruffianism and brutality which slavery employed in its service;
but I would not have felt very safe in this enterprise without the presence of Mr. Clay, who
was known in Kentucky, and everywhere else, as "a fighting Christian," who would defend the
freedom of speech at any hazard.  Our first meeting was in Mr. Fee's church, in the rocky and
mountainous region of the county, where we had perfect order and an attentive and sympathetic
audience. From this point we proceeded the next day to our appointment in Maysville, finding
a good deal of excitement in the city as to the propriety of allowing us to speak in the court
house.  It was finally thrown open to us, and in the afternoon I was handsomely introduced
by Mr. Clay to a fine audience, speaking at length, and with great plainness, on the issues
of the canvass, and being frequently applauded.  Mr. Clay spoke at night to a still larger
audience, while perfect order prevailed.  So far our success seemed gratifying, and Mr. Fee
was delighted; and we proceeded the following morning to our next appointment at Brooksville,
in Bracken county. Here we found assembled a large crowd of that brutalized rabble element
which formed the background of slavery everywhere.  The aboriginal creatures gazed at us like
so many wild animals, but showed not the slightest disposition to enter the house in which
we were to speak.  Mr. Clay remarked that they must be Whigs, since they did not seemed inclined
to "resist," but only to "discountenance" our agitation; but we had come to speak, and with
Mr. Fee's family and a few friends who had come with us for an audience, we spoke about an
hour and a half each, just as if the house had been filled. A few straggled in during the speaking,
and several hung about the windows and listened, though they tried to seem not to do so; but
the most remarkable and praiseworthy thing about this congregation of Yahoos was that they
did not mob us.  It must have seemed to them a strange waste of power to spare such notorious
disturbers of the peace, and return to their homes without any laurels.  This ended our work
in Kentucky, where we could boast that the "finality" platform had been openly set at defiance,
and I returned to my work on the other side of the Ohio.

Later in the canvass, on my return from Wisconsin and Illinois, I learned that Andrew L. Robinson,
the Free Soil candidate for Governor of Indiana, had been mobbed in the city of Terre Haute,
and prevented from making an anti-slavery speech.  This was not surprising, as this section
of the State was largely settled by people from Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky, who were
as intolerant of abolitionism as those of Bracken county already described.  I immediately
sent a telegram making an appointment to speak in that city, and on the day appointed reported
for duty.  I found my friends uneasy and apprehensive.  They evidently regretted my coming,
and some of them advised me quietly to return home.  The town was full of rumors that I was
not to be allowed to speak, and was to be "wabashed," as the rowdies phrased it.  But I had
no thought of returning without being heard; and accordingly, at the appointed hour, I repaired
to the court house, where I found a small crowd assembled, with restless countenances, and
a gang of ruffians outside, armed with stones and brickbats.  The audience gradually increased,
and as I began to speak I noticed that the roughs themselves began to listen, which they continued
to do during the hour and a half I devoted to the most unmistakable utterances on the slavery
question.  The ringleader of the mob, for some reason, failed to give the signal of attack,
and free speech was vindicated.  Timid men grew brave, and boasted of the love of order that
had prompted the people of the town to stand by my rights; yet the mob would probably have
triumphed but for the presence of Joseph O. Jones, the post-master of the city, himself a Kentuckian,
but a believer in the right of free speech and the duty of defending it at all hazards.

The result of this Presidential canvass was a surprise to all parties.  The triumph of the
Democrats was anticipated, but it was far more signal than they expected.  Pierce received
two hundred and fifty-four electoral votes, and Scott only forty-two, representing only four
States of the Union.  So far as the Whig party was concerned, the result was overwhelming and
final.  The party was buried forever in the grave it had dug for itself.  Hale received a little
more than one hundred and fifty-six thousand votes, being about one-twentieth of the entire
popular vote cast at this election; so that nineteen-twentieths of the people of the United
States in 1852, and only a little more than a dozen years before slavery was swept from the
land, voted themselves bound and dumb before this Moloch of American politics, while only one-twentieth
had the courage to claim their souls as their own.  These were very startling facts after more
than a quarter of a century of anti-slavery agitation, and they were naturally interpreted
by the victorious party everywhere as clearly foreshadowing the complete triumph of the "final
settlement" made by Congress in 1850.  Certainly they seemed very disheartening to anti-slavery
men; for, however confidently they might believe in the final success of their struggle, they
could not fail to see the immense odds and fearful obstacles against which they would have
to contend.  The debauched masses who had been molded and kneaded by the plastic touch of slavery
into such base uses, were the only possible material from which recruits could be drawn for
a great party of the future, which should regenerate our politics and re-enthrone the love
of liberty; and this should be remembered in estimating the courage and faith of the men who
in that dark hour held aloft the banner of freedom, in spite of all temptations to go with
the multitude.

But there was another view of the situation which thoughtful anti- slavery men did not fail
to enforce.  The overwhelming triumph of Pierce was not an unmixed victory for slavery.  It
had another explanation.  It was to be remembered, to the credit of the Whig party, that thousands
of its members, notwithstanding their dislike of Pierce and their admiration of Gen. Scott
as a man and a soldier, and despite the attempted drill of their leaders and the influence
of Greeley and Seward, could not be induced to support the ticket, and were now ready for further
acts of independence.  It was likewise to be remembered that in the complete rout and ruin
of the party a great obstacle to anti-slavery progress had been removed.  The slave-holders
at once recognized this fact.  They had aimed to defeat the party, not to annihilate it.  They
saw clearly what slavery needed was two pretty evenly divided parties, pitted against each
other on economic issues, so that under cover of their strife it could be allowed to have its
way; and they were justly alarmed at the prospect of a new movement, having its action upon
moral grounds, and gathering into its ranks the unshackled conscience and intelligence of the
Northern States.  The "Washington Union," then the national organ of the Democracy, deplored
the death of the Whig party, and earnestly hoped for its resurrection.  The fact had always
been patent to anti-slavery men that these parties were alike the bulwarks of slavery, since
the Southern wing of each gave law to the whole body, and that until one or the other could
be totally destroyed, a really formidable anti-slavery party was impossible.  There was also
great cause for encouragement in the evident signs of a growing anti-slavery public opinion.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" had found its way to the millions on both sides of the Atlantic, and the
rage for it among all classes was without parallel in the history of literature.  It was served
up for the masses in sixpenny editions, dramatized and acted on the stage, and coined into
poetry and song.  Slave-holders were alarmed at its wonderful success, because they saw the
grand part it was playing in creating that "public opinion of the civilized world" which Mr.
Webster had declared to be "the mightiest power on earth."  The replies to this wonderful book,
and the anti-slavery and pro-slavery literature to which it gave birth, largely contributed
to the progress of freedom, and the final repudiation of the "finality" which the great parties
had combined to establish.

Nor was the small vote for Hale a matter of serious discouragement. It was much smaller than
that cast for Van Buren in 1848; but that was a deceptive epoch.  Multitudes, and especially
in the State of New York, then voted the Free Soil ticket who had never before shown any interest
in the slavery question, and did not manifest it afterward.  They were not Free Soil men, but
Van Buren men, who hated Gen. Cass.  The vote for Hale represented the bona fide strength of
our cause after this element had been eliminated, and its quality went far to atone for its
quantity.  The proper test of anti-slavery progress was a comparison of the anti-slavery vote
of 1844 with that of 1852, and this showed an increase of nearly three-fold in the intervening
space of eight years.  This steady evolution of anti-slavery opinion from the deadening materialism
and moral inertia of the times could not go backward, but in the very nature of things would
repeat itself, and gather fresh momentum from every effort put forth to stay its advance.

CHAPTER VII.

It was early in the year 1853 that a notable fugitive slave case occurred in Indiana.  The
alleged fugitive was John Freeman, who had once resided in Georgia, but for many years had
been a resident of Indianapolis and had never been a slave.  The marshal of the State, though
he had voted against the passage of the Fugitive Act of 1850, entered upon the service of Ellington,
the claimant, with a zeal and alacrity which made him exceedingly odious to anti- slavery men.
He accompanied Ellington into the jail in which Freeman was confined, and compelled him to
expose his shoulders and legs, so that the witnesses could identify him by certain marks, and
swear according to the pattern, which they did.  The case became critical for Freeman; but
the feeling in Indianapolis was so strong in his favor that a continuance of the hearing was
granted to enable him to prepare his proofs.  He hired friends to go to Georgia, who succeeded
in bringing back with them several men who had known him there many years before, and testified
that he was a free man.  On the day of the trial Ellington became the fugitive, while Freeman
was preparing his papers for a prosecution for false imprisonment. The large crowd in attendance
was quite naturally turned into an anti-slavery meeting, which was made to do good service
in the way of "agitation."  The men from Georgia were on the platform, and while they were
complimented by the speakers on their love of justice and humanity in coming to the rescue
of Freeman, no quarter was given to the Northern serviles and flunkeys who had made haste to
serve the perjured villains who had undertaken to kidnap a citizen of the State under the forms
of an atrocious law.  The meeting was very enthusiastic, and the tables completely turned on
the slave-catching faction.

When President Pierce was inaugurated, on the fourth of March, 1853, the pride and power of
the Democratic party seemed to be at their flood.  In his inaugural message he expressed the
fervent hope that the slavery question was "forever at rest," and he doubtless fully believed
that this hope would be realized.  In his annual message, in December following, he lauded
the Compromise measures with great emphasis, and declared that the repose which they had brought
to the country should receive no shock during his term of office if he could avert it.  The
anti-slavery element in the Thirty-third Congress was scarcely as formidable as in the preceding
one, though there were some accessions.  Benjamin F. Wade was now in the Senate, and De Witt
of Massachusetts, Gerrit Smith of New York, and Edward Wade of Ohio, were members of the House.
In the beginning the session gave promise of a quiet one, but on the twenty-third of January
the precious repose of the country, to which the President had so lovingly referred in his
message, was rudely shocked by the proposition of Senator Douglas to repeal the Missouri compromise.
This surprising demonstration from a leading friend of the Administration and a champion of
the compromise measures marked a new epoch in the career of slavery, and rekindled the fires
of sectional strife.  After a very exciting debate in both houses, which lasted four months,
the measure finally became a law on the thirtieth of May, 1854.  It was a sprout from the grave
of the Wilmot proviso; for if, under the Constitution, it was the duty of Congress to abandon
the policy of restriction in 1850, and provide that Utah and New Mexico should be received
into the Union, with or without slavery, according to the choice of their people, the Missouri
compromise line should never have been established, and was a rock of offense to the slave-holders.
The Compromise Acts of 1850 had not abrogated that line, and related only to our Mexican acquisitions;
but they had affirmed a principle, and if that principle was sound, the Missouri restriction
was indefensible.  The whole question of slavery was thus reopened, for the sacredness of the
compact of 1820 and the wickedness of its violation depended largely upon the character of
slavery itself, and our constitutional relations to it.

On all sides the situation was exceedingly critical and peculiar. The Whigs, in their now practically
disbanded condition, were free to act as they saw fit, and were very indignant at this new
demonstration in the interest of slavery, while they were yet in no mood to countenance any
form of "abolitionism."  Multitudes of Democrats were equally indignant, and were quite ready
to join hands with the Whigs in branding slavery with the violation of its plighted faith.
Both made the sacredness of the bargain of 1820 and the crime of its violation the sole basis
of their hostility. Their hatred of slavery was geographical, spending its force north of the
Missouri restriction.  They talked far more eloquently about the duty of keeping covenants,
and the wickedness of reviving sectional agitation, than the evils of slavery, and the cold-blooded
conspiracy to spread it over an empire of free soil.  Their watch- word and rallying cry was
"the restoration of the Missouri compromise"; but this demand was not made merely as a preliminary
to other measures, which would restore the free States to the complete assertion of their constitutional
rights, but as a means of propitiating the spirit of compromise, and a convenient retreat to
the adjustment acts of 1850 and the "finality" platforms of 1852.  In some States and localities
the anti-slavery position of these parties was somewhat broader; but as a general rule the
ground on which they marshaled their forces was substantially what I have stated.

The position of the Free Soilers was radically different.  They opposed slavery upon principle,
and irrespective of any compact or compromise.  They did not demand the restoration of the
Missouri compromise; and although they rejoiced at the popular condemnation of the perfidy
which had repealed it, they regarded it as a false issue.  It was an instrument on which different
tunes could be played.  To restore this compromise would prevent the spread of slavery over
soil that was free; but it would re-affirm the binding obligation of a compact that should
never have been made, and from which we were now offered a favorable opportunity of deliverance.
It would be to recognize slavery as an equal and honorable contracting party, waiving its violated
faith, and thus precluding us from pleading its perfidy in discharge of all compromises.  It
would degrade our cause to the level of those who washed their hands of all taint of abolitionism,
and only waged war against the Administration because it broke up the blessed reign of peace
which descended upon the country in the year 1850.  These Free Soilers insisted that the breach
of this compact was only a single link in a great chain of measures aiming at the absolute
supremacy of slavery in the Government, and thus inviting a resistance commensurate with that
policy; and that this breach should be made the exodus of the people from the bondage of all
compromises.  They argued that to cut down the issue between slavery and freedom to so narrow,
equivocal, and half-hearted a measure, at a time when every consideration pleaded for radical
and thorough work, was practical infidelity to the cause and the crisis.  It was sporting with
humanity, and giving to the winds a glorious victory for the right when it was within our grasp.

The situation was complicated by two other political elements. One of these was Temperance,
which now, for the first time, had become a most absorbing political issue.  The "Maine Law"
agitation had reached the West, and the demand of the temperance leaders was "search, seizure,
confiscation, and destruction of liquors kept for illegal sale."  Keenly alive to the evils
of drunkenness, and too impatient to wait for the inevitable conditions of progress, they thought
the great work could be accomplished by a legislative short-cut.  They insisted that the "accursed
poison" of the "rumseller," wherever it could be found, should be poured into the gutter along
with other filth, while he should be marched off to answer to the charge of a crime against
society, and take his rank among other great offenders.  Instead of directing their chief attack
against the appetite for drink and seeking to lessen the demand, their effort was to destroy
the supply.  They had evidently given no thought to the function of civil government in dealing
with the problem, nor did they perceive that the vice of drunkenness is an effect, quite as
much as a cause, having its genesis in the unequal laws, in the domination of wealth over the
poor, in the lack of general education, in inherited infirmities, physical and mental, in neglected
household training; in a word, in untoward social conditions which must be radically dealt
with before we can strike with effect at the root of the evil.  They did not see that the temperance
question is thus a many-sided one, involving the general uplifting of society, and that no
legislation can avail much which loses sight of this truth.  For these very reasons the agitation
for a time swept everything before it.  Its current was resistless, because it was narrow and
impetuous.  If the leaders had comprehended the logic of their work and its unavoidable limitations,
and had only looked forward to the overthrow of the fabric of intemperance by undermining its
foundations, the regular current of politics would not have been perceptibly affected, while
the way would have been left open for a more perfect union on the really vital and overshadowing
issue of slavery.

The other element referred to made its appearance in the closing months of 1853, and took the
name of the Know-Nothing party.  It was a secret oath-bound political order, and its demand
was the proscription of Catholics and a probation of twenty-one years for the foreigner as
a qualification for the right of suffrage.  Its career was as remarkable as it was disgraceful.
Thousands were made to believe that the Romish hierarchy was about to overthrow our liberties,
and that the evils of "foreignism" had become so alarming as to justify the extraordinary measures
by which it was proposed to counteract them.  Thousands, misled by political knaves through
the arts of the Jesuits believed that the cause of freedom was to be sanctified and saved by
this new thing under the sun. Thousands, through their unbridled credulity, were persuaded
that political hacks and charlatans were to lose their occupation under the reign of the new
Order, and that our debauched politics were to be thoroughly purified by the lustration which
it promised forthwith to perform.  Thousands, eager to bolt from the old parties, but fearful
of being shot down on the way as deserters, gladly availed themselves of this newly devised
"underground railroad" in escaping from the service of their old masters.  Under these various
influences the Whigs generally, and a large proportion of the Free Soilers and Democrats, were
enlisted in the service of this remarkable movement.  Pretending to herald a new era in our
politics in which the people were to take the helm and expel demagogues and traders from the
ship, it reduced political swindling to the certainty and system of a science.  It drew to
itself, as the great festering centre of corruption, all the known rascalities of the previous
generation, and assigned them to active duty in its service.  It was an embodied lie of the
first magnitude, a horrid conspiracy against decency, the rights of man, and the principle
of human brotherhood.

Its birth, simultaneously with the repeal of the Missouri compromise, was not an accident,
as any one could see who had studied the tactics of the slave-holders.  It was a well-timed
scheme to divide the people of the free States upon trifles and side issues, while the South
remained a unit in defense of its great interest.  It was the cunning attempt to balk and divert
the indignation aroused by the repeal of the Missouri restriction, which else would spend its
force upon the aggressions of slavery; for by thus kindling the Protestant jealousy of our
people against the Pope, and enlisting them in a crusade against the foreigner, the South could
all the more successfully push forward its schemes.

On this ground, as an anti-slavery man, I opposed it with all my might from the beginning to
the end of its life.  For a time it carried everything with a high hand.  It was not only irresistible
in numbers, but it fought in the dark.  It pretended to act openly and in friendly conference
with its enemies as to questions which it had already settled in secret conclave.  Its opponents
did not know how to wage war against it, because they did not know who were their friends.
If a meeting was called to expose and denounce its schemes, it was drowned in the Know-Nothing
flood which, at the appointed time, completely overwhelmed the helpless minority.  This happened
in my own county and town, where thousands of men, including many of my old Free Soil brethren,
assembled as an organized mob to suppress the freedom of speech; and they succeeded by brute
force in taking possession of every building in which their opponents could meet, and silencing
them by savage yells.  At one time I think I had less than a dozen political friends in the
State, and I could see in the glad smile which lighted up the faces of my old- time enemies
that they considered me beyond the reach of political resurrection.  But I never for a moment
intermitted my warfare, or doubted that in the end the truth would be vindicated, although
I did not dream that in less than two years I would be the recognized leader of the men composing
this mob, who would be found denying their membership of this secret order, or confessing it
with shame. It was a strange dispensation; and no record of independent journalism was ever
more honorable than that of the "New York Tribune" and "National Era," during their heroic
and self-sacrificing fight against this organized scheme of bigotry and proscription, which
can only be remembered as the crowning and indelible shame of our politics.  It admits of neither
defense or palliation, and I am sorry to find Henry Wilson's "History of the Rise and Fall
of the Slave Power" disfigured by his elaborate efforts to whitewash it into respectability,
and give it a decent place in the records of the past.

Such were the elements which mingled and commingled in the political ferment of 1854, and out
of which an anti-slavery party was to be evolved capable of trying conclusions with the perfectly
disciplined power of slavery.  The problem was exceedingly difficult, and could not be solved
in a day.  The necessary conditions of progress could not be slighted, and the element of time
must necessarily be a large one in the grand movement which was to come.  The dispersion of
the old parties was one thing, but the organization of their fragments into a new one on a
just basis was quite a different thing.  The honor of taking the first step in the formation
of the Republican party belongs to Michigan, where the Whigs and Free Soilers met in State
convention on the sixth of July, formed a complete fusion into one party, and adopted the name
Republican. This action was followed soon after by like movements in the States of Wisconsin
and Vermont.  In Indiana a State "fusion" convention was held on the thirteenth of July, which
adopted a platform, nominated a ticket, and called the new movement the "People's Party." 
The platform, however, was narrow and equivocal, and the ticket nominated had been agreed on
the day before by the Know- Nothings, in secret conclave, as the outside world afterward learned.
The ticket was elected, but it was done by combining opposite and irreconcilable elements,
and was not only barren of good fruits but prolific of bad ones, through its demoralizing example;
for the same dishonest game was attempted the year following, and was overwhelmingly defeated
by the Democrats.  In New York the Whigs refused to disband, and the attempt to form a new
party failed. The same was true of Massachusetts and Ohio.  The latter State, however, in 1855,
fell into the Republican column, and nominated Mr. Chase for Governor, who was elected by a
large majority.  A Republican movement was attempted this year in Massachusetts, where conservative
Whiggery and Know-Nothingism blocked the way of progress, as they did also in the State of
New York.  In November of the year 1854 the Know-Nothing party held a National Convention in
Cincinnati, in which the hand of slavery was clearly revealed, and the "Third Degree" or pro-slavery
obligation of the order, was adopted; and it was estimated that at least a million and a half
of men afterward bound themselves by this obligation.  In June of the following year another
National Convention of the order was held in Philadelphia, and at this convention the party
was finally disrupted on the issue of slavery, and its errand of mischief henceforward prosecuted
by fragmentary and irregular methods; but even the Northern wing of this Order was untrustworthy
on the slavery issue, having proposed, as a condition of union, to limit its anti-slavery demand
to the restoration of the Missouri restriction and the admission of Kansas and Nebraska as
free States.

Indeed, the outlook as to the formation of a triumphant anti-slavery party was not so promising
towards the close of the year 1855 as it had seemed in the spring of the preceding year.  If
the Free Soilers had been clear-sighted enough to distinguish between that which was transient
and that which was permanent in the forces which had roused the people of the free States,
and, availing themselves of the repeal of the Missouri restriction as a God-send to their cause,
had summoned the manhood of the country to their help, a powerful impulse would have been given
in the right direction. But in the general confusion and bewilderment of the times many of
them lost their way, and were found mustering with the mongrel hordes of Know-Nothingism, and
under captains who were utterly unworthy to lead them.  Instead of inflexibly maintaining their
ground and beckoning the people to come up and possess it, they meanly deserted it themselves,
while vainly expecting others to occupy it.  The Whigs were totally powerless to render any
service without first disbanding their party, and this, in many localities, they declined to
do.  Both wings of the Know-Nothing movement were organized obstacles to the formation of a
new party, while the bolters from the Democrats were as unprepared for radical anti- slavery
work as the Whigs or Know-Nothings.  But notwithstanding all these drawbacks, real progress
had been made.  In the Thirty- fourth Congress, Wilson, Foster, Harlan, Trumbull, and Durkee
were chosen senators.  In the House were Burlingame, Buffington, Banks, Hickman, Grow, Covode,
Sherman, Bliss, Galloway, Bingham, Harlan, Stanton, Colfax, Washburn, and many others.  These
were great gains, and clearly pointed to still larger accessions, and the final subordination
of minor issues to the grand one on which the people of the free States were to take their
stand.  An unprecedented struggle for the Speakership began with the opening of the Thirty-
fourth Congress, and lasted till the second day of February, when the free States finally achieved
their first victory in the election of Banks.  Northern manhood at last was at a premium, and
this was largely the fruit of the "border ruffian" attempts to make Kansas a slave State, which
had stirred the blood of the people during the year 1855.  In the meantime, the arbitrary enforcement
of the Fugitive Slave Act still further contributed to the growth of an anti-slavery opinion.
The famous case of Anthony Burns in Boston, the prosecution of S. M. Booth in Wisconsin, and
the decision of the Supreme Court of that State, the imprisonment of Passmore Williamson in
Philadelphia, and the outrageous rulings of Judge Kane, and the case of Margaret Garner in
Ohio, all played their part in preparing the people of the free States for organized political
action against the aggressions of slavery.

Near the close of the year 1855, the chairmen of the Republican State Committees of Ohio, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin, issued a call for a National Republican Convention to
be held at Pittsburg, on the 22d of February, 1856, for the purpose of organizing a National
Republican party, and making provision for a subsequent convention to nominate candidates for
President and Vice President.  It was very largely attended, and bore witness to the spirit
and courage which the desperate measures of the slave oligarchy had awakened throughout the
Northern States. All the free States were represented, and eight of the slave-holding, namely:
Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Texas.  The
convention assembled in Lafayette Hall, and the Hon. John A. King, of New York, a son of Rufus
King, was made temporary chairman, and Francis P. Blair, of Maryland, the intimate friend of
President Jackson, was made its permanent president.  He was most enthusiastically greeted
on taking the chair, and began his address with the remark that this was the first time he
had ever been called on to make a speech.  His views were too conservative in tone to satisfy
the demands of the crisis, but he was most cordially welcomed as a distinguished delegate from
a slave State.  The convention was opened by a prayer from Owen Lovejoy, and there was a suppressed
murmur of applause when he asked God to enlighten the mind of the President of the United States,
and turn him from his evil ways, and if this was not possible, to take him away, so that an
honest and God-fearing man might fill his place.  Horace Greeley was seen in the audience,
and was loudly and unitedly called on for a speech.  He spoke briefly, saying that he had been
in Washington several weeks, and friends there "counseled extreme caution in our movements."
This was the burden of his exhortation.  At the close of his remarks Mr. Giddings was tumultuously
called for, and responded by saying that Washington was the last place in the world to look
for counsel or redress, and related an anecdote of two pious brothers, named Joseph and John,
who in early times had begun a settlement in the West.  Joseph prayed to the Lord:  "O, Lord!
we have begun a good work; we pray thee to carry it on thus,"--giving specific directions.
But John prayed:  "O, Lord, we have begun a good work; carry it on as you think best, and don't
mind what Joe says."  Mr. Giddings then introduced the Rev. Owen Lovejoy, of Illinois,--"not
Joe, but John."  Mr. Lovejoy delighted the audience, and was followed by Preston King and other
speakers; and it was quite manifest that this was a Republican convention, and not a mere aggregation
of Whigs, Know-Nothings, and dissatisfied Democrats.  It contained a considerable Know-Nothing
element, but it made no attempt at leadership, while Charles Remelin and other speakers were
enthusiastically applauded when they denounced Know-Nothingism as a mischievous side issue
in our politics, which the new movement should openly repudiate.  The convention was in session
two days, and was singularly harmonious throughout.  Its resolutions and address to the people
did not fitly echo the feeling and purpose of its members, but this was a preliminary movement,
and it was evident that nothing could stay the progress of the cause.  As chairman of the committee
on organization, I had the honor to report the plan of action through which the new party took
life, providing for the appointment of a National Executive Committee, the holding of a National
Convention in Philadelphia on the 17th of June, for the nomination of candidates for President
and Vice President, and the organization of the party in counties and districts throughout
the States.

The Philadelphia convention was very large, and marked by unbounded enthusiasm.  The spirit
of liberty was up, and side issues forgotten. If Know-Nothingism was present, it prudently
accepted an attitude of subordination.  The platform reasserted the self-evident truths of
the Declaration of Independence, and denied that Congress, the people of a Territory, or any
other authority, could give legal existence to slavery in any Territory of the United States.
It asserted the sovereign power of Congress over the Territories, and its right and duty to
prohibit it therein.  Know-Nothingism received no recognition, and the double-faced issue of
the restoration of the Missouri compromise was disowned, while the freedom of Kansas was dealt
with as a mere incident of the conflict between liberty and slavery.  On this broad platform
John C. Fremont was nominated for President on the first ballot, and Wm. L. Dayton was unanimously
nominated for Vice-President.  The National Republican party was thus splendidly launched,
and nothing seemed to stand in the way of its triumph but the mischievous action of the Know-Nothing
party, and a surviving faction of pro-slavery Whigs.  The former party met in National Convention
in Philadelphia, on the twenty-second of February, and nominated Millard Fillmore for President
and Andrew J. Donelson for Vice President.  Some bolters from this convention subsequently
nominated Nathaniel P. Banks and William F. Johnson as their candidates, and a remnant of the
Whig party held a convention at Baltimore on the seventeenth of September, and endorsed Fillmore
and Donelson; but a dissatisfied portion of the convention afterward nominated Commodore Stockton
and Kenneth Raynor.  All these factions were destined soon to political extinction, but in
a hand-to-hand fight with the slave power they yet formed a considerable obstacle to that union
and harmony in the free States which were necessary to success.

The Democratic National Convention met at Cincinnati on the second of June.  The candidates
were Buchanan, Pierce, and Douglas.  On the seventeenth ballot Buchanan was unanimously nominated
for President, and on the second ballot John C. Breckenridge was nominated for Vice President.
The platform re-affirmed the action of Congress respecting the repeal of the Missouri compromise
and the compromises of 1850, and recognized the right of the people of all the Territories,
including Kansas and Nebraska, whenever the number of their inhabitants justified it, to form
a Constitution with or without domestic slavery, and to be admitted into the Union upon terms
of equality with the other States.  These declarations, together with the express denial to
Congress of the right to interfere with slavery in the Territories, were accepted as satisfactory
to the South, and were fairly interpreted to mean that the people of the Territories, pending
their territorial condition, had no power to exclude slavery therefrom.  In Mr. Buchanan's
letter of acceptance, he completely buried his personality in the platform, and Albert G. Brown
of Mississippi, and Governor Wise of Virginia, pronounced him as true to the South as Mr. Calhoun
himself.  These were the tickets for 1856, but the real contest was between Buchanan and Fremont.
It was pre-eminently a conflict of principles.  The issues could hardly have been better defined,
and they were vital. It was a struggle between two civilizations, between reason and brute
force, between the principles of Democracy and the creed of Absolutism; and the case was argued
with a force, earnestness, and fervor, never before known.  No Presidential contest had ever
so touched the popular heart, or so lifted up and ennobled the people by the contagion of a
great and pervading moral enthusiasm.  The campaign for Buchanan, however, was not particularly
animated, at least in the Northern States.  It illustrated the power of party machinery, and
the desperate purpose to press forward along a path which had been followed too far to call
a halt.  It was a struggle for party ascendancy by continual and most humiliating concessions
to the ever-multiplying demands of slavery; and the ardor of the struggle must have been cooled
by many troublesome misgivings as to the final effect of these concessions, and the policy
of purchasing a victory at such a price.

The excitement of the canvass was aggravated by very exasperating circumstances.  The brutal
and cowardly assault of Brooks upon Sumner was the counterpart of border ruffianism in Kansas,
and perhaps did more to stir the blood of the people of the Northern States than any of the
wholesale outrages thus far perpetrated in that distant border.  These outrages, however, were
now multiplied in all directions, and took on new shapes.  They were legislative, executive,
and judicial, cropping out in private pillage and assassination, in organized marauding and
murder, and in armed violence; and these horrid demonstrations enlivened the canvass to the
end.  Republican enthusiasm reached its white heat, borrowing the self-forgetting devotion
and dedicated zeal of a religious conversion.  Banks and tariffs and methods of administration
were completely forgotten, while thousands of Democrats who had been trained in the school
of slavery, and hundreds of thousands of conservative Whigs, caught the spirit of liberty which
animated the followers of Fremont and Dayton.  The canvass had no parallel in the history of
American politics.  No such mass-meetings had ever assembled.  They were not only immense in
numbers, but seemed to come together spontaneously, and wholly independent of machinery. The
processions, banners, and devices were admirable in all their appointments, and no political
campaign had ever been inspired by such charming and soul-stirring music, or cheered by such
a following of orderly, intelligent, conscientious and thoroughly devoted men and women.  To
me the memory of this first great national struggle for liberty is a delight, as the part I
played in it was a real jubilee of the heart.  I was welcomed by the Republican masses everywhere,
and the fact was as gratifying to me as it proved mortifying to the party chiefs who, a little
while before, had found such comfort in the assurance that henceforward they were rid of me.
With many wry faces they submitted, after all sorts of manoeuvers early in the canvass to keep
me in the background, varied by occasional threats to drive me out of the party.  As their
own party standing became somewhat precarious they completely changed their base, and often
amused the public by super-serviceable displays of their personal friendship.  Even the ring-leader
of the Know- Nothing mob of two years before, standing up to his full height of "six feet six,"
used to introduce me at mass meetings as "Your honored representative in Congress, and war-worn
veteran in the cause of liberty."

But Buchanan triumphed.  The baleful interposition of Know-Nothingism stood in the way of that
union of forces which the situation demanded, and was thus chiefly responsible for the Republican
defeat.  The old Whigs who had so recently stepped from their "finality" platform, could not
be unitedly rallied, and the Democratic bolters were only half converted.  In my own State
the opposition to the Democracy repudiated even the name Republican, and entered the field
as "the People's party."  It was a combination of weaknesses, instead of a union of forces.
All the Fillmore Know- Nothings and Silver-Grey Whigs of the State were recognized as brethren.
At least one man on the State ticket, of which Oliver P. Morton was the head, was a Fillmore
man, while both Fillmore and anti-Fillmore men had been chosen as delegates to Philadelphia
and electors for the State.  The political managers even went so far as to suppress their own
electoral ticket during the canvass, as a peace-offering to old Whiggery and Know-Nothingism,
while the admission of Kansas as a free State was dealt with as the sole issue, and border
ruffian outrages and elaborate disclaimers of "abolitionism" were the regular staple of our
orators, who openly declared that the Republican party was a "white man's party."  Anti- slavery
speakers like Clay and Burlingame were studiously kept out of Southern Indiana, where the teachings
of Republicanism were especially needed, and Richard W. Thompson, then the professed champion
of Fillmore, but in reality the stipendary of the Democrats, traversed that region on the stump,
denounced the Republicans as "Abolitionists," "disunionists," and "incendiaries," and was everywhere
unchallenged in his course.  Similar tactics, though not so deplorably despicable, prevailed
in several of the other States, giving unmistakable evidence of the need of a still further
and more thorough enlightenment of the people as to the spirit and aims of slavery.  In the
light of these facts, I was not at all cast down by the defeat of Fremont.  He was known as
an explorer, and not as a statesman.  If he had succeeded, with mere politicians in his cabinet,
a Congress against him, and only a partially developed anti-slavery sentiment behind him, the
cause of freedom would have been in fearful peril.  The revolution so hopefully begun might
have been arrested by half-way measures, promoting the slumber rather than the agitation of
the truth, while the irritating nostrums of Buchanan Democracy, so necessary to display the
abominations of slavery, would have been lost to us.  The moral power of the canvass for Fremont
was itself a great gain, notwithstanding the cowardice of some of its leaders.  The Republican
movement could not now go backward, and with a probation of four years to prepare for the next
conflict, unembarrassed by the responsibilities of power, and free to profit by the blunders
and misdeeds of its foe, it was pretty sure of a triumph in 1860. Fremont had received a popular
vote of one million three hundred and forty-one thousand two hundred and sixty-four, carrying
eleven States and one hundred and fourteen electoral votes; while only four years before, John
P. Hale, standing on substantially the same platform, had received only a little more than
one hundred and fifty-seven thousand, and not a single electoral vote.  This showed a marvelous
anti-slavery progress, considering the age of the movement, the elements it forced into combination,
and the difficulties under which it struggled into life; and no one could misinterpret its
significance.

The Republicans, however, were sorely disappointed by their defeat; but this second great victory
of slavery did not at all check the progress of the anti-slavery cause.  It had constantly
gathered strength from the audacity and recklessness of slave-holding fanaticism, and it continued
to do so.  On the 6th of March, 1857, the Supreme Court of the United States harnessed itself
to the car of slavery by its memorable decision in the case of Dred Scott, affirming that Congress
had no power to prohibit slavery in the Territories, and, inferentially, that the Constitution
carried with it the right to hold slaves there, even against the will of their people.  The
point was not before the court, and the opinion of Chief Justice Taney was therefore purely
extra-judicial.  It was simply a political harangue in defense of slavery.  It created a profound
impression throughout the free States, and became a powerful weapon in the hands of Republicans.
It was against the whole current of adjudications on the subject, and they denounced it as
a vile caricature of American jurisprudence.  They characterized it as the distilled diabolism
of two hundred years of slavery, stealthily aiming at the overthrow of our Republican institutions,
while seeking to hide its nakedness under the fig-leaves of judicial fairness and dignity.
They branded it as the desperate attempt of slave-breeding Democracy to crown itself king,
by debauching the Federal judiciary and waging war against the advance of civilization. Their
denunciations of the Chief Justice were unsparing and remorseless; and they described him as
"pouring out the hoarded villainies of a life-time into a political opinion which he tried
to coin into law."  When Senator Douglas sought to ridicule their clamor by inquiring whether
they would take an appeal from the Supreme Court of the United States to a town meeting, they
answered: "Yes, we appeal from the court to the people, who made the Constitution, and have
the right, as the tribunal of last resort, to define its meaning."  Nothing could more clearly
have marked the degradation to which the power of slavery had reduced the country than this
decision, and no other single event could have so prepared the people for resistance to its
aggressions.  It was thoroughly cold-blooded in its letter and spirit, and no Spanish Inquisitor
ever showed less sympathy for his victim than did the Chief Justice for the slave.

But the Dred Scott iniquity did not stand alone.  It had been procured for the purpose of fastening
slavery upon all the Territories, and it had, of course, a special meaning when applied to
the desperate struggle then in progress to make Kansas a slave State. The conduct of the Administration
during this year, in its treatment of the free State men of that Territory, forms one of the
blackest pages in the history of slavery.  The facts respecting their labors, trials, and sufferings,
and the methods employed to force upon them the Lecompton Constitution, including wholesale
ballot-stuffing and every form of ruffianism, pillage, and murder, need not be recalled; but
all these were but the outcroppings and counterpart of the Dred Scott decision, and the horrid
travesty of the principle of popular sovereignty in the Territories.  The whole power of the
Administration, acting as the hired man of slavery, was ruthlessly employed for the purpose
of spreading the curse over Kansas, and establishing it there as an irreversible fact; and
all the departments of the Government now stood as a unit on the side of this devilish conspiracy.
Everybody knew the Lecompton constitution was the work of outside ruffians, and not of the
people of the Territory, whose Legislature in February, 1858, solemnly protested against their
admission under that Constitution, and whose protest was totally unheeded.  The Congressional
debates during this period greatly contributed to the anti-slavery education of the people,
by more clearly unmasking the real spirit and designs of the slaveholders. We were treated
to the kind of talk then becoming current about "Northern mud-sills," "filthy operatives,"
the "ownership of labor by capital," and the beauties and beatitudes of slavery.  Such maddened
extremists as Hammond and Keitt of South Carolina, and such blatant doughfaces as Petit of
Indiana, became capital missionaries in the cause of freedom.  Their words were caught up by
the press of the free States, and added their beneficent help to the work so splendidly going
forward through the providential agency of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

In the meantime, freedom had made large gains in the composition of the Thirty-fifth Congress,
which now had charge of the Lecompton swindle.  The Senate contained twenty Republican members
and the House ninety-two.  Kansas had not been forced into the Union as a slave State, but
she was helpless at the feet of the Executive. In the midst of the angry debate a new proposition
was brought forward, on the twenty-third of April, which was even more detestable than the
Lecompton bill itself.  This was known as the "English bill," which offered Kansas a very large
and tempting land grant, if she would come into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution,
but provided that if she voted to reject the land grant she should neither receive the land
nor be admitted as a State until the Territory acquired a population sufficient to elect a
representative to the House.  The infamy of this proposition was heightened by the fact that
these long-suffering pioneers, weary and harassed by their protracted struggle and longing
for peace, were naturally tempted to purchase it at any price.  It was a proposition of gigantic
bribery, after bluster and bullying had been exhausted. It was, in fact, both a bribe and a
menace, and measured at once the political morality of the men who favored it, and the extremity
to which the slave-holders were driven in the prosecution of their desperate enterprise.  After
a protracted debate in both Houses, and at the end of a struggle of five months, the bill was
passed and received the Executive approval; but the rejoicing of the slave- holders and their
allies was short-lived.  The people of Kansas were not in the market.  They had suffered too
much and too long in the battle for freedom to make merchandise of their convictions and sacrifice
the future of a great commonwealth.  They spurned the bribe, and took the chances of triumph
through an indefinitely prolonged conflict, while recruits to the ranks of freedom were naturally
falling into line throughout the Northern States.

In December of this year I attended another fugitive slave case in Indianapolis.  The claimant
was one Vallandingham, of Kentucky, whose agent caught the alleged fugitive in Illinois, and
was passing through Indianapolis on his way home.  The counsel for the negro, Ellsworth, Coburn,
Colley, and myself, brought the case before Judge Wallace, on habeas corpus, and had him discharged.
The claimant immediately had him arrested and taken before Commissioner Rea, for trial.  We
asked for the continuance of the case on the affidavit of the negro that he was free, and could
prove it if allowed three weeks' time in which to procure his witnesses; but the Commissioner
ruled that the proceeding was a summary ex-parte one, and that the defendant had no right to
any testimony.  Of course we were forced into trial, and after allowing secondary proof where
the highest was attainable, and permitting hearsay evidence and mere rumor, the Commissioner
granted his certificate for the removal of the adjudged fugitive.  We again brought the case
before Judge Wallace, on habeas corpus, when the negro denied all the material facts of the
marshal's return, under oath, and asked to be allowed to prove his denial; but the Judge refused
this, and he was handed over to the marshal for transportation South.  On the trial he was
shown to have been free by the act of his master in sending him into a free State; but under
cover of an infamous law, and by the help of truculent officials, he was remanded into slavery.
The counsel for the negro, with a dozen or more who joined them, resolved upon one further
effort to save him.  The project was that two or three men selected for the purpose were to
ask of the jailer the privilege of seeing him the next morning and giving him good-bye; and
while one of the party engaged the jailer in conversation, the negro was to make for the door,
mount a horse hitched near by, and effect his escape.  The enterprise had a favorable beginning.
The negro got out, mounted a horse, and might have escaped if he had been a good horseman;
but he was awkward and clumsy, and unfortunately mounted the wrong horse, and a very poor traveler;
and when he saw the jailer in pursuit, and heard the report of his revolver, he surrendered,
and was at once escorted South.  Walpole and his brother were for the claimant.  This is the
only felony in which I was ever involved, but none of the parties to it had any disposition
whatever to confess it at the time.

The Republican party gathered fresh courage and strength in the year 1858 from the defection
of Douglas.  His unmistakable ability and hitherto unquestioned devotion to slavery had singled
him out as the great leader and coming man of his party.  He was ambitious, and by no means
scrupulous in his political methods.  The moral character of slavery gave him not the slightest
concern, ostentatiously declaring that he did not care whether it was "voted up or voted down"
in the Territories, and always lavishing his contempt upon the negro.  He was the great champion
of popular sovereignty, but at the same time fully committed himself to the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States, whatever it might be; and after that decision had been
given, and, in effect, against his particular hobby, he defended it, while vainly striving
to vindicate his consistency.  But the Lecompton swindle was so revolting a mockery of the
right of the people of Kansas, that his own Democratic constituents would not endorse it, and
he was obliged, contrary to his strong party inclinations, to take his stand against it.  It
was an event of very great significance, both North and South, and gave great comfort to anti-slavery
men of all shades of opinion; but it brought with it, at the same time, a serious peril to
the Republican party.

His accession to the Anti-Lecompton ranks was deemed so important that many leading Republicans,
of different States, thought he should be welcomed and honored by the withdrawal of all party
opposition to his re-election to the Senate.  They argued that in no other way could the despotic
power of the Democratic power be so effectually broken, and the real interests of republicanism
advanced.  This feeling, for a time, prevailed extensively, and threatened to put in abeyance
or completely supersede the principles so broadly laid down in the national platform of 1856.
The "New York Tribune" took the lead in beating this retreat.  It sympathized with Douglas
to the end of his canvass, and in connection with kindred agencies probably saved him from
defeat.  It urged the disbanding of the Republican party, and the formation of a new combination
against the Democrats, composed of Republicans, Douglas Democrats, Know-Nothings, and old Whigs,
but without any avowal of principles.  It proposed that by the common consent of these parties
the Republicans should be allowed to name the next candidate for the Presidency, and the other
parties the candidate for the Vice Presidency; or that this proposition should be reversed,
if found advisable, with a view to harmony.  The different wings of this combination were to
call themselves by such names and proclaim such principles in different States and localities
as might seem to them most conducive to local success and united ascendancy.  This abandonment
of republicanism was likewise favored by such papers as the "Cincinnati Gazette," which pronounced
the policy of Congressional prohibition worthless as a means of excluding slavery from the
Territories, and openly committed itself to the admission of more slave States, whenever demanded
by a popular majority in any Territory.  "The Indianapolis Journal" and other leading Republican
organs spoke of Congressional prohibition as "murdered by Dred Scott," and as having no longer
any practical value.  In the spring of this year the Republicans of Indiana, in their State
convention, not only surrendered the policy of Congressional prohibition, and adopted the principle
of popular sovereignty, but made opposition to the Lecompton Constitution the sole issue of
the canvass.  Under such leaders as Oliver P. Morton and his Whig and Know-Nothing associates,
Republicanism simply meant opposition to the latest outrage of slavery, and acquiescence in
all preceding ones; but this shameful surrender of the cause to its enemies was deservedly
condemned in the election which followed.  The Legislature of the State, however, at its ensuing
session, overwhelmingly endorsed the Douglas dogma, and even the better class of Republican
papers urged the abandonment of the Republican creed.  But, very fortunately for the cause,
the Republicans of Illinois could not be persuaded to take Mr. Douglas into their embrace on
the score of a single worthy act, and forget, if not forgive, his long career of effective
and untiring hostility to the principles they cherished; and his nomination by the Democrats,
on a platform very offensive to Republicans, fully justified their course.  The result was
the nomination of Mr. Lincoln as a candidate for the succession to Mr. Douglas, and the great
joint debate which did so much to educate the mind of the free States and prepare the way for
Mr. Lincoln's nomination the following year, while revealing the moral unworthiness of his
great rival, and justifying the policy which made necessary this memorable contest in Illinois.

The steady march of the Republican party toward ascendancy was shown in the Thirty-sixth Congress,
which met in December, 1859. There were now twenty-four Republican senators, and one hundred
and nine representatives.  Early in the first session of this Congress an interesting debate
occurred in the Senate on a proposition to provide for the education of the colored children
of the District of Columbia.  Mr. Mason condemned the proposition, and said it was wise to
prohibit the education of the colored race.  Jefferson Davis declared that the Government was
not made for them, and that "we have no right to tax our people to educate the barbarians of
Africa."  These and kindred utterances were very well calculated to aid the work of anti-slavery
progress.  John Brown's raid into Virginia kindled the ire of the slave-holders to a degree
as yet unprecedented, and although his act found few defenders in the Northern States, the
heroism with which he met his fate, the pithy correspondence between Gov. Wise and Mrs. Child,
the language of Southern senators in dealing with the subject, and the efforts made to ferret
out Brown's associates, all tended to strengthen the growing hostility to slavery and prepare
the way for the final conflict.  The designs of the slaveholders upon Cuba, which were avowed
in this Congress, and their purpose to acquire it for the extension of slavery, by purchase
if they could, but if not by war, served the same purpose.  The growing demand for the revival
of the African slave trade, as shown by the avowals of leading men in both houses of Congress,
and their cold-blooded utterances on the subject, produced a profound impression on the country,
and called forth the startling fact that the city of New York was then one of the greatest
slave-trading marts in the world, and that from thirty to sixty thousand persons a year were
taken from Africa to Cuba by vessels from that single port.  Such facts as these, and that
the laws of the Union for the suppression of the traffic were not only a dead letter but that
the slave masters and their allies sullenly refused to take any steps whatever for the remedy
of this organized inhumanity, were capital arguments for the Republicans, which they employed
with telling effect.  The refusal to admit Oregon as a State without a constitutional provision
excluding people of color, the rejection of Kansas on her application with a Constitution fairly
adopted by her people, and the great speech of Sumner on "The Barbarism of Slavery," which
this last application called forth, all served their purpose in the growth of anti-slavery
opinion.  So did the attempt to divide California for the purpose of introducing slavery into
the southern portion; the veto of an Act of the Territorial Legislature of Kansas abolishing
slavery, and of a similar act in Nebraska; the acts of several Southern States permitting free
colored persons to sell themselves as slaves if they chose to do so in preference to expulsion
from the land of their birth and their homes; the decision of the courts of Virginia that slaves
had no social or civil rights, and no legal capacity to choose between being emancipated or
sold as slaves; the refusal of the Government to give a passport to a colored physician of
Massachusetts, for the reason that such privileges were never conferred upon persons of color;
and the revolutionary sentiments uttered by governors and legislatures of various Southern
States, some of which declared that the election of a Republican President would be sufficient
cause for withdrawal from the Union.  That these were important aids to the progress of freedom
was shown by the passage of laws in various Northern States for the protection of personal
liberty, forbidding the use of local jails for the detention of persons claimed as fugitive
slaves, and securing for them the right of trial by jury and the benefit of the writ of habeas
corpus.  This healthy reaction was still further shown in wholesome judicial decisions in several
Northern States affirming the citizenship of negroes, and denying the right of transit of slave-holders
with their slaves over their soil.

The struggle for the Speakership in this Congress, which lasted eight weeks, was also a first-rate
training school for Republicanism. Helper's famous book, "The Impending Crisis," had made a
decided sensation throughout the country, and John Sherman, the principal candidate of the
Republicans for Speaker, had endorsed it, though he now denied the fact.  Mr. Millson of Virginia,
declared that the man who "consciously, deliberately, and of purpose, lends his name and influence
to the propagation of such writings, is not only not fit to be Speaker, but he is not fit to
live."  De Jarnette, of the same State, said that Mr. Seward was "a perjured traitor, whom
no Southerner could consistently support or even obey, should the nation elect him President."
Mr. Pryor said that eight million Southern freemen could not be subjugated by any combination
whatever, "least of all by a miscellaneous mob of crazy fanatics and conscience- stricken traitors."
Mr. Keitt said that "should the Republican party succeed in the next Presidential election,
my advice to the South is to snap the cords of the Union at once and forever."  Mr. Crawford
of Georgia said, "we will never submit to the inauguration of a black Republican President";
and these and like utterances were applauded by the galleries.  The growing madness and desperation
in the Senate were equally noteworthy.  This was shown by the removal of Mr. Douglas from the
chairmanship of the Committee on Territories, and the determined purpose to read him out of
the party for refusing to violate the principle of popular sovereignty in the Territory of
Kansas.  The attempt to hunt down a man who had done the South such signal service in dragooning
the Northern Democracy into its support could not fail to divide the party, and at the same
time completely unmask the extreme and startling designs which the slave power had been stealthily
maturing.  But that power was now absolutely bent upon its purpose, and morally incapable of
pausing in its work.  Its demand was a slave code for the Territories, and it would accept
nothing less.  Jefferson Davis was the champion of this policy, which he embodied in a series
of resolutions and made them the text of an elaborate argument; and Mr. Douglas replied in
a speech which at once vindicated himself and overwhelmingly condemned the party with which
he had so long acted.  The resolutions, however, were adopted by the Senate, which thus proclaimed
its purpose to nationalize slavery.

In the meantime these remarkable legislative proceedings had their counterpart in increasing
lawlessness and violence throughout the South.  This was illustrated in such facts as the expulsion
of members of the Methodist Church North from Texas, the imprisonment of Rev. Daniel Worth,
in North Carolina, for circulating Helper's "Impending Crisis"; the exile from Kentucky of
the Rev. John G. Fee and his colony of peaceable and law-abiding people, on account of their
anti-slavery opinions; and the espionage of the mails by every Southern postmaster, who under
local laws had the power to condemn and "burn publicly" whatever he deemed unfit for circulation,
which laws had been pronounced constitutional by Caleb Cushing, while Attorney General of the
United States under Mr. Pierce, and were "cheerfully acquiesced in" by Judge Holt, Postmaster
General under Buchanan.  In Virginia the spirit of lawlessness became such a rage that one
of her leading newspapers offered a reward of fifty thousand dollars for the head of Wm. H.
Seward, while another paper offered ten thousand dollars for the kidnapping and delivery in
Richmond of Joshua R. Giddings, or five thousand dollars for his head.  In short, the reign
of barbarism was at last fully ushered in, and the whole nation was beginning to realize the
truth of Mr. Lincoln's declaration, which he borrowed from St. Mark, that "a house divided
against itself can not stand."  The people of the free States were at school, with the slaveholders
as their masters; and the dullest scholars were now beginning to get their lessons. Even the
Know-Nothings and Silver-Grey Whigs were coming up to the anxious seat, under the enlightening
influence and saving-grace of slaveholding madness and crime.  The hour was ripe for action,
and the dawn of freedom in the South was seen in the coming emancipation of the North.

The Presidential Campaign of 1860 was a very singular commentary on the Compromise measures
of 1850 and the "finality" platforms of 1852.  The sectional agitation which now stirred the
country outstripped all precedent, and completely demonstrated the folly of all schemes of
compromise.  The Democratic National Convention met in the city of Charleston on the twenty-third
day of May.  Its action now seems astounding, although it was the inevitable result of antecedent
facts.  The Democratic party had the control of every department of the Government, and a formidable
popular majority behind it.  It had the complete command of its own fortunes, and there was
no cause or even excuse for the division which threatened its life.  The difference between
the Southern Democrats and the followers of Douglas was purely metaphysical, eluding entirely
the practical common sense of the people.  Both wings of the party now stood committed to the
Dred Scott decision, and that surrendered everything which the extreme men of the South demanded.
It was "a quarrel about goats' wool," and yet the Southern Democrats were maddened at the thought
of submitting to the nomination of Douglas for the Presidency.  His sin in the Lecompton affair
was counted unpardonable, and they seemed to hate him even more intensely than they hated the
Abolitionists.  A committee on resolutions was appointed, which submitted majority and minority,
or Douglas and anti-Douglas, reports.  These were hotly debated, but the Douglas platform was
adopted, which led to the secession of the Southern delegates.  On the fifty-seventh ballot
Mr. Douglas received a clear majority of the Electoral College, but the Convention then adjourned
till the eighteenth of June, in the hope that harmony might in some way be restored.  On reassembling
this was found impossible, and the balloting was resumed, which finally gave Mr. Douglas all
the votes cast but thirteen, and he was declared the Democratic nominee.  The Convention then
nominated for the Vice Presidency Herschel V. Johnson, of Georgia, a disciple of Calhoun, whose
extreme opinions were well known.  He was unequivocally committed to the doctrine that neither
the General Government nor a Territorial Government can impair the right of slave property
in the common Territories.  This illustration of the political profligacy of the Douglas managers,
and burlesque upon popular sovereignty, was as remarkable as the madness of the seceders in
fighting him for his supposed anti-slavery prejudices.  The bolters from this convention afterward
nominated John C. Breckenridge as their candidate for President and Joseph Lane for Vice President.
The Democratic canvass was thus inaugurated, and the overthrow of the party provided for in
the mere wantonness of political folly.

On the ninth of May what was called the Constitutional Union Party held its convention at Baltimore,
and nominated John Bell for President and Edward Everett for Vice President.  It adopted no
platform, and owing to its neutrality of tint, its action had no significance aside from its
possible effect on the result of the struggle between the Democrats and Republicans.

The Republican National Convention met at Chicago on the sixteenth of May.  It was attended
by immense numbers, and its action was regarded with profound and universal solicitude.  The
platform of the Convention affirmed the devotion of the party to the union of the States and
the rights of the States; denounced the new dogma that the Constitution carried slavery into
the Territories; declared freedom to be their normal condition; denied the power of Congress
or of a Territorial Legislature to give legal existence to slavery in any territory; branded
as a crime the reopening of the African slave trade; condemned the heresy of Know-Nothingism,
and demanded the passage of a Homestead law.  The principles of the party were thus broadly
stated and fully re-affirmed, and the issues of the canvass very clearly presented.  The leading
candidates were Seward and Lincoln, who pretty evenly divided the Convention, and thus created
the liveliest interest in the result.  The friends of Mr. Seward had unbounded confidence in
his nomination, and their devotion to his fortunes was intense and absolute.  The radical anti-slavery
element in the party idolized him, and longed for his success as for a great and coveted national
blessing.  The delegates from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Illinois, representing
a superficial and only half-developed Republicanism, labored with untiring and exhaustless
zeal for the nomination of Mr. Lincoln, fervently pleading for "Success rather than Seward."
Henry S. Lane and Andrew G. Curtin, then candidates for Governor in the States of Indiana and
Pennsylvania, respectively, were especially active and persistent, and their appeals were undoubtedly
effective.  When Seward was defeated many an anti-slavery man poured out his tears over the
result, while deploring or denouncing the conservatism of old fossil Whiggery, which thus sacrificed
the ablest man in the party, and the real hero of its principles.  Time, however, led these
men to reconsider their estimate both of Seward and Lincoln, and convinced them that the action
of the convention, after all, was for the best.  On the second ballot Hamlin was nominated
for Vice President over Clay, Banks, Hickman, and others, and the Republican campaign thus
auspiciously inaugurated.

The canvass for Douglas was prosecuted with remarkable energy and zeal.  He was himself the
great leader of his party on the stump, and his efforts evinced singular courage, audacity,
and will.  It soon became evident, however, that his election was impossible; but this did
not cool his ardor or relax his efforts.  He kept up the fight to the end; and after his defeat,
and when he saw the power that had destroyed him organizing its forces for the destruction
of the Union, he espoused the side of his country, and never faltered in his course.  But as
to slavery he seemed to have no conscience, regarding it as a matter of total moral indifference,
and thus completely confounding the distinction between right and wrong. During the closing
hours of his life he probably saw and lamented this strange infatuation; and he must, at all
events, have deplored the obsequious and studied devotion of a life-time to the service of
a power which at last demanded both the sacrifice of his country and himself.  The canvass
for Lincoln was conducted by the ablest men in the party, and was marked by great earnestness
and enthusiasm. It was a repetition of the Fremont campaign, with the added difference of a
little more contrivance and spectacular display in its demonstrations, as witnessed in the
famous organization known as the "Wide-Awakes."  The doctrines of the Chicago platform were
very thoroughly discussed, and powerfully contributed to the further political education of
the people.  The speeches of Mr. Seward were singularly able, effective and inspiring, and
he was the acknowledged leader of his party and the idol of the Republican masses everywhere.
This was the day of his glory, and nothing yet foreshadowed the political eclipse which awaited
him in the near future.  The triumph of the Republicans in this struggle was not, however,
final.  A great work yet remained to be done.  A powerful anti-slavery party had at last appeared,
as the slow creation of events and the fruit of patient toil and endeavor; but it had against
it a popular majority of nearly a million.  Both Houses of Congress and the Supreme Court of
the United States disputed its authority and opposed its advance.  The President-elect could
not form his cabinet without the leave of the Senate, which was controlled by slavery, nor
could he set the machinery of his Administration in motion, at home or abroad, through the
exercise of his appointing power, without the consent of his political opponents.  As Mr. Seward
declared in the Senate, "he could not appoint a minister or even a police agent, negotiate
a treaty or procure the passage of a law, and could hardly draw a musket from the public arsenal
to defend his own person."  The champions of slavery had no dream of surrender, and no excuse
whatever for extreme measures; and with moderate counsels and the prudent economy of their
advantages, they were the undoubted masters of their own fortunes for indefinite years to come.
But their extravagant and exasperating demands, and the splendid madness of their latter day
tactics as illustrated in their warfare against Douglas, were the sure presages of their overthrow.
There was method in their madness, but it was the method of self-destruction.  This was made
still more strikingly manifest during the months immediately preceding the inauguration of
Mr. Lincoln.  The Republicans, notwithstanding their great victory, so recoiled from the thought
of sectional strife that for the sake of peace they were ready to forego their demand for the
Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories.  They were willing to abide by the
Dred Scott decision and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave law.  They even proposed a Constitutional
amendment which would have made slavery perpetual in the Republic; but the pampered frenzy
of the slave oligarchy defied all remedies, and hurried it headlong into the bloody conspiracy
which was to close forever its career of besotted lawlessness and crime.

Early in January, 1861, I paid a visit to Mr. Lincoln at his home in Springfield.  Although
I had zealously supported him in the canvass, and was strongly impressed by the grasp of thought
and aptness of expression which marked his great debate with Douglas, yet as a through-going
Free Soiler and a member of the radical wing of Republicanism, my prepossessions were against
him.  He was a Kentuckian, and a conservative Whig, who had supported General Taylor in 1848,
and General Scott four years later, when the Whig party finally sacrificed both its character
and its life on the altar of slavery.  His nomination, moreover, had been secured through the
diplomacy of conservative Republicans, whose morbid dread of "abolitionism" unfitted them,
as I believed, for leadership in the battle with slavery which had now become inevitable, while
the defeat of Mr. Seward had been to me a severe disappointment and a real personal grief.
The rumor was also current, and generally credited, that Simon Cameron and Caleb B. Smith were
to be made Cabinet Ministers, in recognition of the important services rendered by the friends
of these gentlemen in the Chicago Convention.  Still, I did not wish to do Mr. Lincoln the
slightest injustice, while I hoped and believed his courage and firmness would prove equal
to the emergency.  The Cabinet rumor referred to was true.  He felt bound by the pledges which
his leading friends had made in his name pending the National Convention; and the policy on
which he acted in these and many other appointments was forcibly illustrated on a subsequent
occasion, when I earnestly protested against the appointment of an incompetent and unworthy
man as Commissioner of Patents.  "There is much force in what you say," said he, "but, in the
balancing of matters, I guess I shall have to appoint him."  This "balancing of matters" was
a source of infinite vexation during his administration, as it has been to every one of his
successors; and its most deplorable results have been witnessed in the assassination of a president.

The closing months of Mr. Buchanan's Administration were dismal and full of apprehension. 
One by one the slaveholding States were seceding from the Union.  The President, in repeated
messages, denied their right to secede, but denied also the right of the Government to coerce
them into obedience.  It should be remembered, to his credit, that he did insist upon the right
to enforce the execution of the laws in all the States, and earnestly urged upon Congress the
duty of arming him with the power to do this; but Congress, much to its discredit, paid no
attention to his wishes, leaving the new Administration wholly unprepared for the impending
emergency, while strangely upbraiding the retiring President for his non-action.  For this
there could be no valid excuse.  The people of the Northern States, now that the movement in
the South was seen to be something more than mere bluster, were equally alarmed and bewildered.
The "New York Herald" declared that "coercion, if it were possible, is out of the question."
The "Albany Argus" condemned it as "madness."  The "Albany Evening Journal" and many other
leading organs of Republicanism, East and West, disowned it, and counseled conciliation and
further concessions to the demands of slavery.  It is true, that it justified the secession
of the Southern States as a revolutionary right; but although these States defended it as a
constitutional one, the broader and higher ground of Mr. Greeley necessarily gave powerful
aid and comfort to their movement.  In the meantime, great meetings in Philadelphia and New
York strongly condemned the Abolitionists, and urged the most extravagant additional concessions
to slavery for the sake of peace.  He was willing to give up Congressional prohibition of slavery
in the Territories, enforce the Fugitive Slave law, and perpetuate slavery in our Republic
by amending the Constitution for that purpose. The Crittenden compromise, which practically
surrendered everything to slavery, only failed in the Senate by one vote, and this failure
resulted from the non-voting of six rebel senators, who were so perfectly devil-bent upon the
work of national dismemberment that they would not listen to any terms of compromise, or permit
their adoption.  The Peace Congress, assembled for the purpose of devising some means of national
pacification, agreed upon a series of measures covering substantially the same ground as the
Crittenden compromise, while both Houses of Congress agreed to a constitutional amendment denying
any power to interfere with slavery "until every State in the Union, by its individual State
action, shall consent to its exercise."  The feverish dread of war which prevailed throughout
the Northern States was constantly aggravated by multiplying evidences of slaveholding desperation.
The general direction of public opinion pointed to the Abolitionists as the authors of these
national troubles, while the innocent and greatly-abused slaveholders were to be petted and
placated by any measures which could possibly serve their purpose.  Indeed, the spirit of Northern
submission had never, in the entire history of the anti-slavery conflict, been more strikingly
exhibited than during the last days of the Thirty- sixth Congress, when the Capital of the
Republic was threatened by armed treason, and the President-elect reached Washington in a disguise
which baffled the assassins who had conspired against his life.  To the very last the old medicine
of compromise and conciliation seemed to be the sovereign hope of the people of the free States;
and although it had failed utterly, and every offer of friendship and peace had been promptly
spurned as the evidence of weakness or cowardice, they clung to it till the guns of Fort Sumter
roused them from their perilous dream.

The inauguration of the President was awaited with great anxiety and alarm.  The capture of
Washington by the rebels was seriously apprehended, and had undoubtedly been meditated.  The
air was filled with rumors respecting the assassination of the President, and the stories told
of the various methods of his taking off would have been amusing if the crisis had not been
so serious.  General Scott took all the precautions for the preservation of the peace which
the small force at his command, and the District militia, enabled him to do.  The day was beautiful,
and the procession to the Capitol quite imposing.  Mr. Lincoln and ex-President Buchanan entered
the Senate chamber arm in arm; and the latter was so withered and bowed with age that in contrast
with the towering form of Mr. Lincoln he seemed little more than half a man.  The crowd which
greeted the President in front of the east portico of the Capitol was immense, and has never
been equaled on any similar occasion with the single exception of General Garfield's inauguration.
Mr. Lincoln's voice, though not very strong or full-toned, rang out over the acres of people
before him with surprising distinctness, and was heard in the remotest parts of his audience.

But as an offering of friendship and fair dealing to the South, this speech failed of its purpose
as signally as all kindred endeavors had done from the beginning.  The "Richmond Enquirer"
and "Whig," the "Charleston Mercury," and other leading organs of secession, denounced the
inaugural, and seemed to be maddened by the very kindliness of its tone and the moderation
of its demands. Their purpose was disunion and war, and every passing day multiplied the proofs
that no honorable escape from this fearful alternative was possible.

The policy of the new Administration prior to the attack upon Sumter forms perhaps the most
remarkable chapter in the history of the war.  All the troubles of the previous Administration
were now turned over to Mr. Lincoln, and while no measures had been provided to aid him in
their settlement the crisis was constantly becoming more imminent.  The country was perfectly
at sea; and while all hope of reconciliation was fading from day to day, Mr. Seward insisted
that peace would come within "sixty days."  His optimism would have been most amusing, if the
salvation of the country had not been at stake.  The President himself not only still hoped,
but believed, that there would be no war; and notwithstanding all the abuse that had been heaped
upon Mr. Buchanan by the Republicans for his feeble and vacillating course, and especially
his denial of the right of the government to coerce the recusant States, the policy of the
new Administration, up to the attack upon Sumter, was identical with that of his predecessor.
In Mr. Seward's official letter to Mr. Adams, dated April 10, 1861, he says the President "would
not be disposed to reject a cardinal dogma of theirs (the secessionists), namely, that the
Federal Government could not reduce the seceding States to obedience through conquest, even
though he were disposed to question that proposition.  But in fact the President willingly
accepts it as true. * * * The President, on the one hand, will not suffer the Federal authority
to fall into abeyance, nor will he, on the other hand, aggravate existing evils by attempts
at coercion, which must assume the direct form of war against any of the revolutionary States."
These are very remarkable avowals, in the light of the absolute unavoidableness of the conflict
at the time they were made; and they naturally tended to precipitate rather than avert the
threatened catastrophe.  It will not do to say that Secretary Seward spoke only for himself,
and not for the Administration; for the fact has since been established by the evidence of
other members of the Cabinet that Mr. Lincoln, while he had great faith in Mr. Seward at first,
was always himself the President.  No member of it was his dictator.  I do not say that he
endorsed all Mr. Seward's peculiar views, for the latter went still further, as the country
has since learned, and favored the abandonment of Fort Sumter and other Southern forts, as
a part of a scheme of pacification looking to an amendment to the Constitution in the interest
of slavery.  During this early period Mr. Chase himself, with all his anti-slavery radicalism
and devotion to the Union, became so far the child of the hour as to deprecate the policy of
coercion and express his belief that if the rebel States were allowed to go in peace they would
soon return.  But "war legislates," and the time had now come when nothing else could break
the spell of irresolution and blindness which threatened the Union even more seriously than
armed treason itself.

Notwithstanding this strange epoch of Republican feebleness and indecision, the warfare against
Mr. Buchanan was never intermitted. It had been prosecuted with constantly increasing vigor
since the year 1856, and had now become so perfectly relentless and overwhelming that he was
totally submerged by the waves of popular wrath; and for twenty odd years no political resurrection
has been thought possible.  Although his personal integrity was as unquestionable as that of
John C. Calhoun or George III, and his private life as stainless, yet his public character
has received no quarter from his enemies and but little defense from his friends.  One of his
most formidable critics, writing long years after the war, describes him as "hungry for regard,
influence, and honor, but too diminutive in intellect and character to feel the glow of true
ambition--a man made, so to speak, to be neither loved nor hated, esteemed nor despised, slighted
nor admired; intended to play an influential part in the agitation of parties, and by history
to be silently numbered with the dead, because in all his doings there was not a single deed;
a man to whom fate could do nothing worse than place him at the helm in an eventful period."
While there is a measure of truth in this picture, I believe any fair-minded man will pronounce
it over-drawn, one-sided, and unjust, after reading the recently published life of Mr. Buchanan
by George Ticknor Curtis, dealing fully with his entire public career in the clear, cold light
of historic facts.  The most pronounced political foe of Mr. Buchanan can not go over the pages
of this elaborate and long-delayed defense without modifying some of his most decided opinions;
but one thing remains obviously true, and that is in dealing with the question of slavery Mr.
Buchanan was wholly without a conscience. The thought seems never to have dawned upon him that
the slave was a man, and therefore entitled to his natural rights.  In a public speech on the
ninth of July, 1860, defining his position, and referring to the Dred Scott decision, he says:
"It is to me the most extraordinary thing in the world that this country should now be distracted
and divided because certain persons at the North will not agree that their brethren at the
South should have the same rights in the Territories which they enjoy.  What would I, as a
Pennsylvanian, say or do, supposing any one was to contend that the Legislature of any Territory
could outlaw iron or coal within the Territory?  The principle is precisely the same.  The
Supreme Court of the United States has decided, what was known to us all to have been the existing
state of affairs for fifty years, that slaves are property.  Admit that fact, and you admit
everything."

In this passage, as in all that he has written on the subject of slavery, humanity is totally
ignored.  The right of property in man is just as sacred to him, "as a Pennsylvanian," as the
right of property in iron or coal.  He unhesitatingly accepts the Dred Scott decision as law,
which the moral sense of the nation and its ablest jurists pronounced a nullity.  Mr. Jefferson,
in speaking of slavery, said he trembled for his country, and declared that one hour of bondage
is fraught with more misery than whole ages of our colonial oppression.  Such a sentiment in
the mouth of Mr. Buchanan would have been as unnatural as a voice from the dead. He saw nothing
morally offensive in slavery, or repugnant to the principles of Democracy.  He reverenced the
Constitution, but always forgot that its compromises were agreed to in the belief that the
institution was in a state of decay, and would soon wear out its life under the pressure of
public opinion and private interest. Throughout his public life he never faltered in his devotion
to the South, joining hands with alacrity in every measure which sought to nationalize her
sectional interest.  The growing anti-slavery opinion of the free States, which no power could
prevent, and the great moral currents of the times, which were as resistless as the tides of
the sea, had no meaning for him, because the Democracy he believed in had no foundation in
the sacredness of human rights.

Mr. Lincoln, in spite of the troubled state of the country, was obliged to encounter an army
of place-seekers at the very beginning of his administration.  I think there has been nothing
like it in the history of the Government.  A Republican member of Congress could form some
idea of the President's troubles from his own experience.  I fled from my home in the later
part of February, in the hope of finding some relief from these importunities; but on reaching
Washington I found the business greatly aggravated.  The pressure was so great and constant
that I could scarcely find time for my meals, or to cross the street, and I was obliged to
give my days and nights wholly to the business, hoping in this way I should be able in a while
to finish it; but it constantly increased.  I met at every turn a swarm of miscellaneous people,
many of them looking as hungry and fierce as wolves, and ready to pounce upon members as they
passed, begging for personal intercession, letters of recommendation, etc.  During my stay
in Washington through the months of March and April, there was no pause in this business. After
Fort Sumter had been taken and the armory at Harper's Ferry had been burned; after a Massachusetts
regiment had been fired on in passing through Baltimore, and thirty thousand men were in Washington
for defensive purposes; after the President had called for seventy-five thousand volunteers,
and the whole land was in a blaze of excitement, the scuffle for place was unabated, and the
pressure upon the strength and patience of the President unrelieved. This was not very remarkable,
considering the long-continued monopoly of the offices by the Democrats; but it jarred upon
the sentiment of patriotism in such a crisis, and to those who were constantly brought face
to face with it, it sometimes appeared as if the love of office alone constituted the animating
principle of the party.

When Congress assembled in special session on the Fourth of July, the atmosphere of the Northern
States had been greatly purified by the attack on Fort Sumter.  The unavoidableness of war
was now absolute, and the tone of the President's message was far bolder and better than that
of his inaugural.  The policy of tenderness towards slavery, however, still revealed itself,
and called forth the criticism of the more radical Republicans.  They began to distrust Mr.
Seward, who no longer seemed to them the hero of principle they had so long idolized, while
his growing indifference to the virtue of temperance was offensive to many.  He impressed his
old anti-slavery friends as a deeply disappointed man, who was in danger of being morally lost.
Their faith was even a little shaken in Secretary Chase.  Of course, they did not believe him
false to his long-cherished anti-slavery convictions, but he was amazingly ambitious, and in
the dispensation of his patronage he seemed anxious to make fair weather with some of his old
conservative foes, while apparently forgetting the faithful friends who had stood by him from
the very beginning of his career, and were considered eminently fit for the positions they
sought.  The rumor was afloat that even Charles Sumner was urging the claims of Mr. Crittenden
to a place on the Supreme Bench, as a means of conciliating the State of Kentucky.  Washington
was largely a city of secessionists, and the departments of the Government were plentifully
supplied by sympathizers with treason, while the effort put forth at this session to dislodge
them was not responded to by the Administration. What became known as the Border State policy
was beginning to assert itself everywhere, and was strikingly illustrated in the capture of
fugitive slaves and their return to their rebel masters by our commanding generals, and by
reiterated and gratuitous disavowals of "abolitionism" by prominent Republicans.

But the war spirit was fully aroused, and active preparations were on foot for an advance upon
the enemy.  The confidence in General Scott seemed to be unbounded, and I found everybody taking
it for granted that when the fight began our forces would prove triumphantly victorious.  On
the day before the battle of Bull Run I obtained a pass from General Scott, intending to witness
the engagement, believing I could do so, of course, with perfect safety, as our army would
undoubtedly triumph.  I had a very strong curiosity to see a great battle, and was now gratified
with the prospect of doing so; but a lucky accident detained me.  The battle was on Sunday,
and about eleven o'clock at night I was roused from my slumber by Col. Forney, who resided
on Capitol Hill near my lodgings, and who told me our army had been routed, and that the rebels
were marching upon the capital and would in all probability capture it before morning.  No
unmiraculous event could have been more startling.  The event was so totally unlooked for,
and the disappointment so terrible, that people grew suddenly sick at heart, and felt as if
life itself, with all its interests and charms, had been snatched from their grasp.  The excitement,
turmoil and consternation continued during the night and through the following day; but no
one could adequately picture or describe it.  Our soldiers came straggling into the city, covered
with dirt and many of them wounded, while the panic which led to the disaster spread like a
contagion through all classes.

On the day following this battle Congress met as usual, and undoubtedly shared largely in the
general feeling. To through-going anti-slavery men this seemed like an apology for the war,
and a most ill-timed revival of the policy of conciliation, which had been so uniformly and
contemptuously spurned by the enemy. It failed utterly of its purpose, and this historic resolve
of Congress was only useful to the rebels, who never failed to wield it as a weapon against
us, after the teaching of events had compelled us to make slavery the point of attack.  The
Confiscation Act of the 6th of August was regarded as a child of the same sickly ancestry.
The section of the Act making free the slaves employed against us by the rebels in their military
operations was criticised as a bribe to them to fight us, rather than a temptation to espouse
our cause.  If they engaged in the war at all, they were obliged to do so as our enemies; but
if they remained at home on their plantations in the business of feeding the rebel armies,
they would have the protection of both the loyal and Confederate Governments. The policy of
both parties to the struggle was thus subordinated to the protection of slavery.

But on the 31st of August a new war policy was inaugurated by the proclamation of General Fremont,
giving freedom to the slaves of rebels in his department.  It was greeted by the people of
the Northern States with inexpressible gladness and thanksgiving.  The Republican press everywhere
applauded it, and even such Democratic and conservative papers as the "Boston Post," the "Detroit
Free Press," the "Chicago Times," and the "New York Herald" approved it.  During the ten days
of its life all party lines seemed to be obliterated in the fires of popular enthusiasm which
it kindled, and which was wholly unprecedented in my experience.  I was then on the stump in
my own State, and I found the masses everywhere so wild with joy, that I could scarcely be
heard for their shouts. As often as I mentioned the name of "Fremont," the prolonged hurrahs
of the multitude followed, and the feeling seemed to be universal that the policy of "a war
on peace principles" was abandoned, and that slavery, the real cause of the war, was no longer
to be the chief obstacle to its prosecution.

But in the midst of this great exultation and joy the President annulled the proclamation because
it went beyond the Confiscation Act of the 6th of August, and was offensive to the Border States.
It was a terrible disappointment to the Republican masses, who could not understand why loyal
slaveholders in Kentucky should be offended because the slaves of rebels in Missouri were declared
free.  From this revocation of the new war policy, dated the pro- slavery reaction which at
once followed.  It balked the popular enthusiasm which was drawing along with it multitudes
of conservative men.  It caused timid and halting men to become cowards outright. It gave new
life to slavery, and encouraged fiercer assaults upon "abolitionism."  It revived and stimulated
Democratic sympathy for treason wherever it had existed, and necessarily prolonged the conflict
and aggravated its sorrows; while it repeated the ineffable folly of still relying upon a policy
of moderation and conciliation in dealing with men who had defiantly taken their stand outside
of the Constitution and laws, and could only be reached by the power of war.

When Congress met in December, the policy of deference to slavery still continued.  The message
of the President was singularly dispassionate, deprecating "radical and extreme measures,"
and recommending some plan of colonization for the slaves made free by the Confiscation Act.
Secretary Cameron, however, surprised the country by the avowal of a decidedly anti-slavery
war policy in his report; but in a discussion in the House early in December, on General Halleck's
"Order No. Three," I took occasion to expose his insincerity by referring to his action a little
while before in restoring to her master a slave girl who had fled to the camp of Colonel Brown,
of the Twentieth Indiana regiment, who had refused to give her up.  On the nineteenth of December,
a joint select Committee on the Conduct of the War was appointed, composed of three members
of the Senate and four members of the House.  The Senators were B. F. Wade, of Ohio; Z. Chandler,
of Michigan, and Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee; and the House members were John Covode, of Pennsylvania;
M. F. Odell, of New York; D. W. Gooch, of Massachusetts, and myself.  The committee had its
birth in the popular demand for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, and less tenderness
toward slavery; and I was gratified with my position on it because it afforded a very desirable
opportunity to learn something of the movements of our armies and the secrets of our policy.

On the sixth of January, by special request of the President, the committee met him and his
Cabinet at the Executive Mansion, to confer about the military situation.  The most striking
fact revealed by the discussion which took place was that neither the President nor his advisers
seemed to have any definite information respecting the management of the war, or the failure
of our forces to make any forward movement.  Not a man of them pretended to know anything of
General McClellan's plans.  We were greatly surprised to learn that Mr. Lincoln himself did
not think he had any right to know, but that, as he was not a military man, it was his duty
to defer to General McClellan.  Our grand armies were ready and eager to march, and the whole
country was anxiously waiting some decisive movement; but during the delightful months of October,
November and December, they had been kept idle for some reason which no man could explain,
but which the President thought could be perfectly accounted for by the General-in-Chief. 
Secretary Cameron said he knew nothing of any plan for a forward movement.  Secretary Seward
had entire confidence in General McClellan, and thought the demand of the committee for a more
vigorous policy uncalled for.  The Postmaster-General made no definite avowals, while the other
members of the Cabinet said nothing, except Secretary Chase, who very decidedly sympathized
with the committee in its desire for some early and decisive movement of our forces.  The spectacle
seemed to us very disheartening.  The testimony of all the commanding generals we had examined
showed that our armies had been ready to march for months; that the weather and roads had been
most favorable since October; and that the Army of the Potomac was in a fine state of discipline,
and nearly two hundred thousand strong, while only about forty thousand men were needed to
make Washington perfectly safe.  Not a general examined could tell why this vast force had
so long been kept idle, or what General McClellan intended to do. The fate of the nation seemed
committed to one man called a "General- in-Chief," who communicated his secrets to no human
being, and who had neither age nor military experience to justify the extraordinary deference
of the President to his wishes.  He had repeatedly appeared before the committee, though not
yet as a witness, and we could see no evidence of his pre-eminence over other prominent commanders;
and it seemed like a betrayal of the country itself to allow him to hold our grand armies for
weeks and months in unexplained idleness, on the naked assumption of his superior wisdom. 
Mr. Wade, as Chairman of the committee, echoed its views in a remarkably bold and vigorous
speech, in which he gave a summary of the principal facts which had come to the knowledge of
the committee, arraigned General McClellan for the unaccountable tardiness of his movements,
and urged upon the Administration, in the most undiplomatic plainness of speech, an immediate
and radical change in the policy of the war.  But the President and his advisers could not
yet be disenchanted, and the conference ended without results.

When General McClellan was placed at the head of our armies the country accepted him as its
idol and hero.  The people longed for a great captain, and on very inadequate grounds they
assumed that they had found him, and that the business of war was to be carried on in earnest.
But they were doomed to disappointment, and the popular feeling was at length completely reversed.
The pendulum vibrated to the other extreme, and it is not easy to realize the wide-spread popular
discontent which finally revealed itself respecting the dilatory movements of our forces. 
The people became inexpressibly weary of the reiterated bulletins that "all is quiet on the
Potomac"; and the fact that General McClellan was in full sympathy with the Border State policy
of the President aggravated their unfriendly mood.  A majority of the members of the committee
became morbidly sensitive, and were practically incapable of doing General McClellan justice.
They were thoroughly discouraged and disgusted; but when Secretary Cameron left the Cabinet
and Stanton took his place, their despondency gave place to hope.  He had faith in the usefulness
of the committee, and co-operated with it to the utmost.  He agreed with us fully in our estimate
of General McClellan, and as to the necessity of an early forward movement.  We were delighted
with him, and had perfect confidence in his integrity, sagacity and strong will.  We worked
from five to six hours per day, including the holiday season, and not excepting the Sabbath,
going pretty thoroughly into the Bull Run disaster, the battle of Ball's Bluff, and the management
of the Western Department.

During the months of January and February, the committee made repeated visits to the President
for the purpose of urging the division of the Army of the Potomac and its organization into
army corps.  We insisted upon this on the strength of the earnest recommendations of our chief
commanders, and with a view to greater military efficiency; but the President said General
McClellan was opposed to it, and would, he believed, resign his command in the alternative
of being required to do it.  Mr. Lincoln said he dreaded "the moral effect of this"; but in
the latter part of February, he began to lose his faith in the General, and finally, after
nearly two months of perseverance by the committee, he gave his order early in March, which
General McClellan obeyed with evident hesitation and very great reluctance.  A few days later
the long-tried patience of the President became perfectly exhausted.  He surprised and delighted
the committee by completely losing his temper, and on the 11th relieved General McClellan from
the command of all our forces except the Army of the Potomac.  The rebels, in the meantime,
had evacuated their works at Centreville and Manassas, and retreated with their munitions in
safety.  A majority of the committee at this time strongly suspected that General McClellan
was a traitor, and they felt strengthened in this suspicion by what they afterward saw for
themselves at Centreville and Manassas, which they visited on the thirteenth of March.  They
were certain, at all events, that his heart was not in the work.  He had disregarded the President's
general order of the nineteenth of January, for a movement of all our armies, which resulted
in the series of victories of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, etc., which so electrified the country.
He had protested against the President's order of the thirty-first of January, directing an
expedition for the purpose of seizing a point upon the railroad southwest of Manassas Junction.
He had opposed all forward movements of the Army of the Potomac, and resolutely set his face
against the division of our forces into army corps, as urged by all our chief commanders. 
And he had again and again refused to co-operate with the navy in breaking up the blockade
of the Potomac, while his order to move in the direction of the enemy at Centreville and Manassas
was given after the evacuation of these points.

Our journey to Manassas was full of interest and excitement.  About ten miles from Washington
we came in sight of a large division of the Grand Army of the Potomac, which had started toward
the enemy in obedience to the order of General McClellan.  The forest on either side of the
road was alive with soldiers, and their white tents were to be seen in all directions through
the pine forests, while in the adjacent fields vast bodies of soldiers in their uniforms were
marching and counter-marching, their bayonets glittering in the sunlight.  Large bodies of
cavalry were also in motion, and the air was filled with the sound of martial music and the
blasts of the bugle.  Soldiers not on drill were running races, playing ball, and enjoying
themselves generally in every sort of sport. The spectacle was delightfully exhilarating, and
especially so to men just released from the dreary confinement and drudgery of their committee
rooms.

On approaching Centreville the first object that attracted our attention was one of the huge
earthworks of the enemy, with large logs placed in the embrasures, the ends pointing toward
us, and painted black in imitation of cannon.  The earthworks seemed very imperfectly constructed,
and from this fact, and the counterfeit guns which surmounted them, it was evident that no
fight had been seriously counted on by the absconding forces.  The substantial character of
their barracks, bake-ovens, stables, and other improvements, confirmed this view; and on reaching
Manassas we found the same cheap defenses and the same evidences of security, while the rebel
forces were much less than half as great as ours, and within a day's march from us.  What was
the explanation of all this?  Why had we not long before, driven in the rebel pickets, and
given battle to the enemy, or at least ascertained the facts as to the weakness of his position?
Could the commander be loyal who had opposed all the previous forward movements of our forces,
and only made this advance after the enemy had evacuated?  These were the questions canvassed
by the members of the committee in their passionate impatience for decisive measures, and which
they afterward earnestly pressed upon the President as a reason for relieving General McClellan
of his command.  They were also greatly moved by the fact already referred to, that General
McClellan had neglected and repeatedly refused to co-operate with the navy in breaking up the
blockade of the Potomac, which could have been done long before according to the testimony
of our commanders, while he had disobeyed the positive order of the President respecting the
defenses of Washington by reserving only nineteen thousand imperfectly disciplined men for
that service, through which the capital had been placed at the mercy of the enemy.  Meanwhile
the flame of popular discontent had found further fuel in the threats of McClellan to put down
slave insurrections "with an iron hand," and his order expelling the Hutchinsons from the Army
of the Potomac for singing Whittier's songs of liberty.  Of course I am not dealing with the
character and capacity of General McClellan as a commander, but simply depicting the feeling
which extensively prevailed at this time, and which justified itself by hastily accepting merely
apparent facts as conclusive evidence against him.  The Secretary arraigned the General's conduct
in the severest terms, particularizing his blunders, and branding them.  He told us the President
was so completely in the power of McClellan that he had recently gone to Alexandria in person
to ask him for some troops from the Army of the Potomac for General Fremont, which were refused.
He said he believed there were traitors among the commanders surrounding General McClellan,
and if he had had the power he would have dismissed eight commanders when the wooden-gun discovery
was made; and he fully agreed with us as to the disgraceful fact that our generals had not
long before discovered, as they could have done, the real facts as to the rebel forces and
their defences.

It was quite evident from these facts that Stanton, with all his force of will, did not rule
the President, as the public has generally supposed.

Whether this anecdote is literally true or not, it illustrates the character of the two men.

On Sunday, the thirteenth of April, we were again summoned to meet Secretary Stanton, and he
had also invited Thaddeus Stevens, of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Fessenden, of
the Senate Finance Committee, and Mr. Wilson and Colonel Blair, of the Senate and House Military
Committees.  The business of this conference was to consider the necessity of immediate measures
for raising thirty million dollars to pay the troops unwisely accepted by the President in
excess of the number called for by Congress, and the proper action to be taken relative to
the sale of Austrian guns by a house in New York for shipment to the enemy.  The Secretary
was this time in fine spirits, and I was much interested in the free talk which occurred. 
Mr. Stevens indulged in his customary bluntness of speech, including a little spice of profanity
by way of emphasis and embellishment.  He declared that not a man in the Cabinet, the present
company excepted, was fit for his business.  Mr. Fessenden said he fully endorsed this, while
sly glances were made to Colonel Blair, whose brother was thus palpably hit.  Mr. Stevens said
he was tired of hearing d----d Republican cowards talk about the Constitution; that there was
no Constitution any longer so far as the prosecution of the war was concerned; and that we
should strip the rebels of all their rights, and given them a reconstruction on such terms
as would end treason forever.  Secretary Stanton agreed to every word of this, and said it
had been his policy from the beginning.  Fessenden denounced slave-catching in our army, and
referred to a recent case in which fugitives came to our lines with most valuable information
as to rebel movements, and were ordered out of camp into the clutches of their hunters.  Stanton
said that ten days before McClellan marched toward Manassas, contrabands had come to him with
the information that the rebels were preparing to retreat, but that McClellan said he could
not trust them.  Wade was now roused, and declared that he had heard McClellan say he had uniformly
found the statements of these people reliable, and had got valuable information from them.
But McClellan was still king, and the country was a long way yet from that vigorous war policy
which alone could save it.

In the meantime the strife between the radical and conservative elements in the Republican
party found expression in other directions.  Secretary Smith had previously declared, in a
public speech, that "this is not a war upon the institution of slavery, but a war for the restoration
of the Union," and that "there could not be found in South Carolina a man more anxious, religiously
and scrupulously, to observe all the features of the Constitution, than Abraham Lincoln." 
He also opposed the arming of the negroes, declaring that "it would be a disgrace to the people
of the free States to call upon four millions of blacks to aid in putting down eight millions
of whites."  Similar avowals were made by other members of the Cabinet.  This persistent purpose
of the Administration to save the Union and save slavery with it, naturally provoked criticism,
and angered the anti-slavery feeling of the loyal States.  The business of slave-catching in
the army continued the order of the day, till the pressure of public opinion finally compelled
Congress to prohibit it by a new article of war, which was approved by the President on the
13th of March.  The repressive power of the Administration, however, was very formidable, and
although the House of Representatives, as early as the 20th of December, 1861, had adopted
a resolution offered by myself, instructing the Judiciary Committee to report a bill so amending
the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 as to forbid the return of fugitives without proof first made
of the loyalty of the claimant, yet on the 26th of May, 1862, the House, then overwhelmingly
Republican, voted down a bill declaring free the slaves of armed rebels, and making proof of
loyalty by the claimant of a fugitive necessary to his recovery.  This vote sorely disappointed
the anti-slavery sentiment of the country.  On this measure I addressed the House in a brief
speech, the spirit of which was heartily responded to by my constituents and the people of
the loyal States generally. They believed in a vigorous prosecution of the war, and were sick
of "the never-ending gabble about the sacredness of the Constitution." "It will not be forgotten,"
I said, "that the red-handed murderers and thieves who set this rebellion on foot went out
of the Union yelping for the Constitution which they had conspired to overthrow by the blackest
perjury and treason that ever confronted the Almighty."  This speech was the key-note of my
approaching Congressional canvass, and I was one of the very few men of decided anti-slavery
convictions who were able to stem the conservative tide which swept over the Northern States
during this dark and dismal year.  I had against me the general drift of events; the intense
hostility of Governor Morton and his friends throughout the State; nearly all the politicians
in the District, and nine of its twelve Republican newspapers, and the desperate energy and
cunning of trained leaders in both political parties, who had pursued me like vultures for
a dozen years.  My triumph had no taint of compromise in it, and nothing saved me but perfect
courage and absolute defiance of my foes.

One of the great compensations of the war was the passage of the Homestead Act of the 20th
of May.  It finally passed the House and Senate by overwhelming majorities.  Among the last
acts of Mr. Buchanan's administration was the veto of a similar measure, at the bidding of
his Southern masters; and the friends of the policy had learned in the struggle of a dozen
years that its success was not possible while slavery ruled the government.  The beneficent
operation of this great and far-reaching measure, however, was seriously crippled by some unfortunate
facts.  In the first place, it provided no safeguards against speculation in the public domain,
which had so long scourged the Western States and Territories, and was still extending its
ravages.  Our pioneer settlers were offered homes of one hundred and sixty acres each on condition
of occupancy and improvement, but the speculator could throw himself across their track by
buying up large bodies of choice land to be held back from settlement and tillage for a rise
in price, and thus force them further into the frontier, and on to less desirable lands.

In the next place, under the new and unguarded land-grant policy, which was simultaneously
inaugurated, millions of acres fell into the clutches of monopolists, and are held by them
to-day, which would have gone to actual settlers under the Homestead law, and the moderate
land grant policy originated by Senator Douglas in 1850.  This was not foreseen or intended.
The nation was then engaged in a struggle for its existence, and thus exposed to the evils
of hasty legislation.  The value of the lands given away was not then understood as it has
been since, while the belief was universal that the lands granted would be restored to the
public domain on failure to comply with the conditions of the grants. The need of great highways
to the Pacific was then regarded as imperative, and unattainable without large grants of the
public lands.  These are extenuating facts; but the mischiefs of this ill- starred legislation
are none the less to be deplored.

In the third place, under our new Indian treaty policy, invented about the same time, large
bodies of land, when released by our Indian tribes, were sold at low rates to individual speculators
and monopolists, or to railway corporations, instead of being conveyed, as before, to the United
States, and thus subjected to general disposition, as other public land.  These evils are now
remedied, but for nearly ten years they were unchecked.  The title to Indian lands was secured
through treaties concocted by a ring of speculators and monopolists outside of the Senate,
and frequently ratified by that body near the close of a long session, when less than half
a dozen members were in their seats, and the entire business was supervised by a single Western
senator acting as the agent of his employers and the sharer in their plunder.  These fatal
mistakes in our legislation have made the Homestead law a half-way measure, instead of that
complete reform in our land policy which was demanded, and they furnish a remarkable commentary
upon the boasted friendship of the Republican party for the landless poor.

The conservative war-policy of the Administration continued to assert itself.  The action of
the President in promptly revoking the order of General Hunter, of the ninth of May, declaring
free the slaves of the States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, aggravated the growing
impatience of the people.  On the ninth day of June I submitted a resolution instructing the
judiciary committee to report a bill repealing the Fugitive Slave Act, which was laid on the
table by a vote of sixty-six to fifty-one, sixteen Republicans voting in the affirmative. 
On the second of July I called to see the President, and had a familiar talk about the war.
He looked thin and haggard, but seemed cheerful.  Although our forces were then engaged in
a terrific conflict with the enemy near Richmond, and everybody was anxious as to the result,
he was quite as placid as usual, and could not resist his "ruling passion" for anecdotes. 
He was still holding fast his faith in General McClellan, and this was steadily widening the
breach between him and Congress, and periling the success of the war.  The general gloom in
Washington increased till the adjournment, but Mr. Sumner still had faith in the President,
and prophesied good things as to his final action.

The Confiscation Act of this session, which was approved by the President on the seventeenth
day of July, providing that slaves of rebels coming into our lines should be made free, and
that the property of their owners, both real and personal, should be confiscated, would have
given great and wide-spread satisfaction; but the President refused to sign the bill without
a modification first made exempting the fee of rebel land-owners from its operation, thus powerfully
aiding them in their deadly struggle against us. This action was inexpressibly provoking; but
Congress was obliged to make the modification required, as the only means of securing the important
advantages of other features of the measure.  This anti-republican discrimination between real
and personal property when the nation was struggling for its life against a rebellious aristocracy
founded on the monopoly of land and the ownership of negroes, roused a popular opposition which
thus far was altogether unprecedented.  The feeling in Congress, however, was far more intense
than throughout the country.

Just before leaving Washington I called on the President again, and told him I was going to
take the stump, and to tell the people that he would co-operate with Congress in vigorously
carrying out the measures we had inaugurated for the purpose of crushing the rebellion, and
that now the quickest and hardest blows were to be dealt.  He told me I was authorized to say
so, but said that more than half the popular clamor against the management of the war was unwarranted;
and when I referred to the movements of General McClellan he made no committal in any way.

On the nineteenth of August Horace Greeley wrote his famous anti- slavery letter to the President,
entitled "The Prayer of Twenty Millions."  It was one of the most powerful appeals ever made
in behalf of justice and the rights of man.  These words served as fresh fuel to the fires
of popular discontent, and they were responded to by Mr. Greeley with admirable vigor and earnestness.
The anti-slavery critics of the President insisted that in thus dealing with slavery as a matter
of total indifference he likened himself to Douglas, who had declared that he didn't care whether
slavery was voted up or voted down in the Territories.  They argued that as slavery was the
cause of the war and the obstacle to peace, it was the duty of the Government to lay hold of
the conscience of the quarrel, and strike at slavery as the grand rebel.  Not to do so, they
contended, now that the opportunity was offered, was to make the contest a mere struggle for
power, and thus to degrade it to the level of the wars of the Old World, which bring with them
nothing for freedom or the race.  They insisted that the failure of the Government to give
freedom to our millions in bondage would be a crime only to be measured by that of putting
them in chains if they were free. They reminded the President of his declaration that a house
divided against itself can not stand, and that the Republic can not permanently exist half
slave and half free; and they urged that this baptism of fire and blood would be impious if
the cause which produced it should be spared to canker the heart of the nation anew, and repeat
its diabolical deeds.  A Union with slavery spared and reinstated would not be worth the cost
of saving it.  To argue that we were fighting for a political abstraction called the Union,
and not for the destruction of slavery, was to affront common sense, since nothing but slavery
had brought the Union into peril, and nothing could make sure the fruits of the war but the
removal of its cause.  It was to delude ourselves with mere phrases, and conduct the war on
false pretenses.  It was to rival the folly of the rebels, who always asservated that they
were not fighting for slavery, but only for the right of local self government, when the whole
world knew the contrary.  These ideas, variously presented and illustrated, found manifold
expression in innumerable Congressional speeches and in the newspapers of the Northern States,
and a month later brought forth the President's proclamation of the twenty- second of September,
giving the insurgents notice that on the first day of January following he would issue his
proclamation of general emancipation, if they did not in the meantime lay down their arms.
The course of events and the pressure of opinion were at last forcing him to see that the nation
was wrestling with slavery in arms; that its destruction was not a debatable and distant alternative,
but a pressing and absolute necessity; and that his Border State policy, through which he had
so long tried to pet and please the power that held the nation by the throat, was a cruel and
fatal mistake.  This power, however, had so completely woven itself into the whole fabric of
American society and institutions, and had so long fed upon the virtue of our public men, that
the Administration was not yet prepared to divorce itself entirely from the madness that still
enthralled the conservative element of the Republican party.

It was during this year that a formidable effort was made by the old Whig element in the Republican
party to disband the organization and form a new one, called the "Union party."  They were
disposed to blame the Abolitionists for the halting march of events, and to run away from the
real issues of the conflict.  They were believers in the Border State policy, and favored the
colonization of the negroes, while deprecating "radical and extreme measures."  They forgot
that the Republican principle was as true in the midst of war as in seasons of peace, and that
instead of putting it in abeyance when the storm came, we should cling to it with redoubled
energy and purpose.  They forgot that the contest of 1860 was not only a struggle between slavery
and freedom, but a struggle of life and death, inasmuch as the exclusion of slavery from all
federal territory would not only put the nation's brand upon it in the States of the South,
and condemn it as a public enemy, but virtually sentence it to death.  They forgot that the
charge of "abolitionism," which was incessantly hurled at the Republican party, was thus by
no means wanting in essential truth, and that when the slaveholders were vanquished in the
election of Mr. Lincoln, their appeal from the ballot to the bullet was the logical result
of their insane devotion to slavery, and their conviction that nothing could save it but the
dismemberment of the Republic.  They forgot that the Rebellion was simply an advanced stage
of slaveholding rapacity, and that instead of tempting us to cower before it and surrender
our principles, it furnished an overwhelming argument for standing by them to the death.  This
movement was fruitful of great mischief throughout the loyal States, and on my return to Washington
in the fall of this year I was glad to find this fact generally admitted, and my earnest opposition
to it fully justified by the judgment of Republican members of Congress.

Immediately after the battle of Fredericksburg, on the 13th of December, the Committee on the
Conduct of the War visited that place for the purpose of inquiring into the facts respecting
that fearful disaster.  The country was greatly shocked and excited, and eager to know who
was to blame.  We examined Burnside, Hooker, Sumner, and Woodbury; but prior to this, in a
personal interview with General Burnside, he frankly told me that he was responsible for the
attack.  He seemed to be loaded down with a mountain of trouble and anxiety, and I could see
that he felt just as a patriotic man naturally would, after sacrificing thousands of men by
a mistaken movement.  He said he had no military ambition, and frankly confessed his incapacity
to command a large army, as he had done to the President and Secretary of War, when they urged
him to assume this great responsibility; and that he was very sorry he had ever consented to
accept it.  His conversation disarmed all criticism, while his evident honesty decidedly pleased
me.  It was a sad thought, while standing on the banks of the Rappahannock, that here were
more than a hundred thousand men on either side of a narrow river, brethren and kindred, and
naturally owing each other nothing but good will, who were driven by negro slavery into the
wholesale slaughter of each other.  But General Burnside told me our men did not feel toward
the rebels as they felt toward us, and he assured me that this was the grand obstacle to our
success.  Our soldiers, he said, were not sufficiently fired by resentment, and he exhorted
me, if I could, to breathe into our people at home the same spirit toward our enemies which
inspired them toward us.  As I approached one of the principal hospitals here, I was startled
by a pile of arms and legs of wounded soldiers, and on entering the building I found scores
of men in the last stages of life, stretched on the floor with nothing under them but a thin
covering of hay, and nothing over them but a coarse blanket or quilt, and without a spark of
fire to warm them, though the weather was extremely cold and they were literally freezing to
death.  Some of them were too far gone to speak, and looked at me so pleadingly that I can
never forget the impression it made.  Arrangements were made for their comfort as soon as it
was possible.

On New Year's day I joined the immense throng of callers at the White House, but did not enjoy
the delay of the President in issuing his Proclamation of Emancipation.  It came late in the
day, and brought relief to multitudes of anxious people.  Perhaps no subject has ever been
more widely misunderstood than the legal effect of this famous document, and the circumstances
under which it was issued.  Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed to the measure, and when he very
reluctantly issued his preliminary proclamation in September, he wished it distinctly understood
that the deportation of the slaves was, in his mind, inseparably connected with the policy.
Like Mr. Clay and other prominent leaders of the old Whig party, he believed in colonization,
and that the separation of the two races was necessary to the welfare of both.  He was at that
time pressing upon the attention of Congress a scheme of colonization in Chiriqui in Central
America, which Senator Pomeroy espoused with great zeal, and in which he had the favor of a
majority of the Cabinet, including Secretary Smith, who warmly endorsed the project. Subsequent
development, however, proved that it was simply an organization for land-stealing and plunder,
and it was abandoned; but it is by no means certain that if the President had foreseen this
fact, his preliminary notice to the rebels would have been given.  There are strong reasons
for saying that he doubted his right to emancipate under the war power, and that he meant what
he said when he compared an executive order to that effect to the "Pope's Bull against the Comet."

But he saw no way of escape.  The demand for such an edict was wide- spread and rapidly extending
in the Republican party.  The power to issue it was taken for granted.  All doubts on the subject
were consumed in the burning desire of the people, or forgotten in the travail of war.  The
anti-slavery element was becoming more and more impatient and impetuous.  Opposition to that
element now involved more serious consequences than offending the Border States. Mr. Lincoln
feared that enlistments would cease, and that Congress would even refuse the necessary supplies
to carry on the war, if he declined any longer to place it on a clearly defined anti-slavery
basis.  It was in yielding to this pressure that he finally became the liberator of the slaves
through the triumph of our arms which it ensured.

The authority to emancipate under the war power is well settled, but it could only be asserted
over territory occupied by our armies. Each Commanding General, as fast as our flag advanced,
could have offered freedom to the slaves, as could the President himself. This was the view
of Secretary Chase.  A paper proclamation of freedom, as to States in the power of the enemy,
could have no more validity than a paper blockade of their coast.  Mr. Lincoln's proclamation
did not apply to the Border States, which were loyal, and in which slavery was of course untouched.
It did not pretend to operate upon the slaves in other large districts, in which it would have
been effective at once, but studiously excluded them, while it applied mainly to States and
parts of States within the military occupation of the enemy, where it was necessarily void.
But even if the proclamation could have given freedom to the slaves according to its scope,
their permanent enfranchisement would not have been secured, because the status of slavery,
as it existed under the local laws of the States prior to the war, would have remained after
the re-establishment of peace.  All emancipated slaves found in those States, or returning
to them, would have been subject to slavery as before, for the simple reason that no military
proclamation could operate to abolish their municipal laws.  Nothing short of a Constitutional
amendment could at once give freedom to our black millions and make their re-enslavement impossible;
and "this," as Mr. Lincoln declared in earnestly urging its adoption, "is a king's cure for
all evils.  It winds the whole thing up." All this is now attested by high authorities on International
and Constitutional law, and while it takes nothing from the honor so universally accorded to
Mr. Lincoln as the great Emancipator, it shows how wisely he employed a grand popular delusion
in the salvation of his country.  His proclamation had no present legal effect within territory
not under the control of our arms; but as an expression of the spirit of the people and the
policy of the Administration, it had become both a moral and a military necessity.

During this month I called with the Indiana delegation to see the President respecting the
appointment of Judge Otto, of Indiana, as Assistant Secretary of the Interior.  He was afterward
appointed, but Mr. Lincoln then only responded to our application by treating us to four anecdotes.
Senator Lane told me that when the President heard a story that pleased him he took a memorandum
of it and filed it away among his papers.  This was probably true.  At any rate, by some method
or other, his supply seemed inexhaustible, and always aptly available.  Early in February General
Burnside came before the War Committee, and gave the most startling testimony as to the demoralization
of the Army of the Potomac, the bickerings and jealousies of the commanding generals, and the
vexations of the President in dealing with the situation.  On the 18th of March I called on
Mr. Lincoln respecting the appointments I had recommended under the conscription law, and took
occasion to refer to the failure of General Fremont to obtain a command.  The President proceeded
to point out the practical difficulties in the way by referring to a number of important commands
which might suit Fremont, but which could only be reached by removals he did not wish to make.
I remarked that I was very sorry if this was true, and that it was unfortunate for our cause,
as I believed his restoration to duty would stir the country as no other appointment could.
He said, "it would stir the country on one side, and stir it the other way on the other.  It
would please Fremont's friends, and displease the conservatives; and that is all I can see
in the stirring argument."  "My proclamation," he added, "was to stir the country; but it has
done about as much harm as good."  These observations were characteristic, and showed how reluctant
he was to turn away from the conservative counsels he had so long heeded.

On the 3d day of April the final report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War was completed,
and the portion of it relating to the Army of the Potomac was in the hands of the Associated
Press, and awaited by the public with a curiosity which it is not easy now to realize.  The
formation of the committee, as already stated, grew out of the popular demand for a more vigorous
war policy, and its action was thus exposed to the danger of hasty conclusions; but the press
and public opinion of the loyal States, with remarkable unanimity, credited it with great usefulness
to the country, through its labors to rescue the control of the war from incompetent and unworthy
hands.

I returned home by way of Philadelphia and New York, and had a delightful visit in the former
place with James and Lucretia Mott, whom I had not seen since 1850.  In New York I attended
the great "Sumter meeting" of the 13th, and spoke at one of the stands with General Fremont
and Roscoe Conkling.  While in the city I met Mr. Bryant, Phebe Carey, Mr. Beecher and other
notables, and on my way home tarried two days with Gerrit Smith, at his hospitable home in
Peterboro.  According to his custom he invited a number of his neighbors and friends to breakfast,
and by special invitation I addressed the people in the evening, at the "free church" of the
town, on topics connected with the war.  I could see that Mr. Smith did not approve the severity
of my language, and that this was a source of amusement to some of his neighbors, but the course
of events afterward radically changed his views, and he admitted that in his public addresses
he was greatly aided by the imprecatory psalms.  I had several delightful rambles with him,
our conversation turning chiefly upon reformatory and theological topics, and I found myself
more than ever in love with this venerable philanthropist whom I had only met once before,
on his visit to Washington the previous year.

On the night of the 8th of July the fire-bells of the town of Centreville, in which I resided,
roused the people, who rushed into the streets to learn that General John Morgan, with six
thousand cavalry and four pieces of artillery, had crossed the Ohio, and was moving upon the
town of Corydon.  The Governor had issued a call for minute men for the defense of the State,
and within forty- eight hours sixty five thousand men tendered their services. Messengers were
at once dispatched to all parts of Wayne County conveying the news of the invasion, and the
next morning the people came pouring in from all directions, while the greatest excitement
prevailed.  The town had eighty muskets, belonging to its Home Guard, and I took one of them,
which I afterward exchanged for a good French rifle; and having put on the military equipments,
and supplied myself with a blanket and canteen, I was ready for marching orders.  The volunteers
who rallied at Centreville were shipped to Indianapolis, and were about seven hours on the
way.  I was a member of Company C, and the regiment to which I belonged was the One Hundred
and Sixth, and was commanded by Colonel Isaac P. Gray.  Of the force which responded to the
call of the Governor, thirteen regiments and one battalion were organized specially for the
emergency, and sent into the field in different directions, except the One Hundred and Tenth
and the One Hundred and Eleventh, which remained at Indianapolis.  The One Hundred and Sixth
was shipped by rail to Cincinnati, and but for a detention of several hours at Indianapolis,
caused by the drunkenness of an officer high in command, it might possibly have encountered
Morgan near Hamilton, the next morning, on the way South.  Our reception in Cincinnati was
not very flattering.  The people there seemed to feel that Ohio was able to take care of herself;
and, in fact, nothing could have been more unreasonable than sending a body of infantry one
hundred miles in pursuit of a cavalry force in that vicinity, where an ample body of cavalry
was in readiness, and the river well guarded by gun-boats.

We were re-shipped to Indianapolis by rail, where we were mustered out of service and returned
to our homes after a campaign of eight days.  This was the sum of my military experience, but
it afforded me some glimpses of the life of a soldier, and supplied me with some startling
facts respecting the curse of intemperance in our armies.

In the latter part of July of this year I addressed several meetings in Ohio, in company with
Gov. Brough, beginning at Toledo.  His speeches were too conservative for the times, as he
soon discovered by their effect upon the people; but I found him singularly genial and companionable,
and full of reminiscences of his early intimacy with Jackson, Van Buren and Silas Wright. 
Early in September I returned to Ohio to join Hon. John A. Bingham in canvassing Mr. Ashley's
district under the employment of the State Republican Committee.  Mr. Vallandigham, then temporarily
colonized in Canada, was the Democratic candidate for Governor, and the canvass was "red- hot."
At no time during the war did the spirit of war more completely sway the loyal masses.  It
was no time to mince the truth, or "nullify damnation with a phrase," and I fully entered into
the spirit of General Burnside's advice already referred to, to breathe into the hearts of
the people a feeling of animosity against the rebels akin to that which inspired their warfare
against us.  I remember that at one of the mass-meetings I attended, where Col. Gibson was
one of the speakers, a Cincinnati reporter who had prepared himself for his work dropped his
pencil soon after the oratorical fireworks began, and listened with open mouth and the most
rapt attention till the close of the speech; and he afterward wrote to his employer an account
of the meeting, in which he said that reporting was simply impossible, and he could only say
the speaking was "beautifully terrible."  As a stump-speaker Col. Gibson was then without a
rival in the West.  His oratory was an irresistible fascination, and no audience could ever
grow tired of him.  The speeches of Mr. Bingham were always admirable.  His rhetoric was singularly
charming.  He was an artist in his work, but seldom repeated himself, while gathering fresh
inspiration, and following some new line of thought at every meeting.  After our work was done
in the Toledo district I accompanied Mr. Ashley to Jefferson, where he and others were to address
a mass-meeting, which we found assembled in front of the court house.  The day was rainy and
dismal, and the meeting had already been in session for hours; but after additional speeches
by Ashley and Hutchins I was so loudly called for a little while before sunset, that I responded
for about three-quarters of an hour, when I proposed to conclude, the people having been detained
already over four hours while standing in a cold drizzling rain; but the cry of "go on" was
very emphatic, and seemed to be unanimous.  "Go ahead," said a farmer, "we'll hear you; it's
past milking time anyhow!"  It seemed to me I had never met such listeners.  I was afterward
informed that the test of effective speaking on the Reserve is the ability to hold an audience
from their milking when the time for it comes, and I thought I passed this test splendidly.
After my return from Ohio I made a brief canvass in Iowa, along with Senator Harlan and Governor
Stone, and spent the remainder of the fall on the stump in my own State.

In the 38th Congress, Speaker Colfax made me Chairman of the Committee on Public Lands, which
gratified me much.  It opened a coveted field of labor on which I entered with zeal.  On the
14th of December I introduced a bill for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law, and in order
to test the sense of the House on the question, I offered a resolution instructing the Judiciary
Committee to report such a bill.  Greatly to my astonishment it was laid on the table by a
vote of yeas eighty-two, nays seventy-four.  Many Republicans declined to vote, and we were
evidently still under the lingering spell of slavery.  Early in January an organized movement
was set on foot in the interest of Mr. Chase for the Presidency, and I was made a member of
a Central Committee which was appointed for the purpose of aiding the enterprise.  I was a
decided friend of Mr. Chase, and as decidedly displeased with the hesitating military policy
of the Administration; but on reflection I determined to withdraw from the committee and let
the presidential matter drift.  I had no time to devote to the business, and I found the committee
inharmonious, and composed, in part, of men utterly unfit and unworthy to lead in such a movement.
It was fearfully mismanaged.  A confidential document known as the "Pomeroy circular," assailing
Mr. Lincoln and urging the claims of Mr. Chase, was sent to numerous parties, and of course
fell into the hands of Mr. Lincoln's friends.  They became greatly excited, and by vigorous
counter measures created a strong reaction.  A serious estrangement between the President and
his Secretary was the result, which lasted for several months.  The Chase movement collapsed,
and when the Republican members of the Ohio Legislature indorsed the re-nomination of Mr. Lincoln,
Mr. Chase withdrew from the contest.  The opposition to Mr. Lincoln, however, continued, and
was secretly cherished by many of the ablest and most patriotic men in the party.  The extent
of their opposition in Congress can never be known, and it was greatly aggravated by successive
military failures; but it lacked both courage and leadership, and culminated in the nomination
of General Fremont in the latter part of May.

In this Congress a new joint select committee on the "conduct of the war" was organized, armed
with new powers, and authorized to sit in vacation; and in common with most of the members
of the former committee I was re-appointed.  During the latter part of January I reported from
the Committee on Public Lands a proposition to extend the Homestead Law of 1862 to the forfeited
and confiscated lands of Rebels.  It was a very radical proposition, proposing to deal with
these lands as public lands, and parcel them out into small homesteads among the poor of the
South, black and white. The subject was a large one, involving many important questions, and
I devoted much time and thought to the preparation of a speech in support of the measure. 
In the month of April a portion of the Committee on the Conduct of the War visited Fort Pillow,
for the purpose of taking testimony respecting the rebel atrocities at that place; and this
testimony and that taken at Annapolis, early in May, respecting the treatment of our soldiers
in the prisons at Richmond was published, as a special instalment of our proceedings, for popular
use, accompanied by photographs of a number of prisoners in their wasted and disfigured condition.
The report produced a powerful effect on the public mind, and caused unspeakable trouble and
vexation to the enemy.  I assisted in the examination of our prisoners at Annapolis, and never
before had been so touched by any spectacle of human suffering.  They were in the last stages
of life, and could only answer our questions in a whisper.  They were living skeletons, and
it seemed utterly incredible that life could be supported in such wasted and attenuated shadows
of themselves. They looked at us, in attempting to tell their story, with an expression of
beseeching tenderness and submission which no words could describe.  Not one of them expressed
any regret that he had entered into the service of the country, and each declared that he would
do so again, if his life should be spared and the opportunity should be offered.  In examining
one of these men I was perfectly unmanned by my tears; and on retiring from the tent to give
them vent I encountered Senator Wade, who had fled from the work, and was sobbing like a child.
It was an altogether unprecedented experience, and the impression it produced followed me night
and day for weeks.

The conservative policy of the Administration found a new and careful expression in Mr. Lincoln's
letter to A. G. Hodges, of the 4th of April.  It showed great progress as compared with previous
utterances, but his declaration that "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly
that events have controlled me," was displeasing to the more anti-slavery Republicans.  They
insisted that the Administration had no right to become the foot-ball of events.  It had no
right, they said, at such a time, to make itself a negative expression or an unknown quantity
in the Algebra which was to work out the great problem.  It had no right, they insisted, to
take shelter beneath a debauched and sickly public sentiment, and plead it in bar of the great
duty imposed upon it by the crisis. It had no right, certainly, to lag behind that sentiment,
to magnify its extent and potency, and then to become its virtual ally, instead of endeavoring
to control it, and to indoctrinate the country with ideas suited to the emergency.  It was
the duty of the President, like John Bright and the English Liberals, to lead, not follow public
opinion.  These criticisms found every variety of utterance through Congressional speeches
and the press, and met with a cordial response from the people; and they undoubtedly played
their part in preparing the country and the Administration for the more vigorous policy which
was to follow.

On the 12th of May the House passed my Southern Homestead Bill by the strictly party vote of
seventy-five to sixty-four.  In my closing speech on the subject I was frequently interrupted
by Wood of New York, and Mallory of Kentucky, and the debate ran into very sharp personalities,
but the opposition of these members only tended to strengthen the measure.  On the 19th I was
drawn into an exceedingly angry altercation with Mr. Mallory, who charged me with forging some
very personal remarks about himself, and interpolating them into the "Congressional Globe"
as a part of my speech of the 12th.  He was exceedingly insolent and overbearing in his manner,
growing more and more so as he proceeded, and strikingly recalling the old days of slavery.
He summoned a number of friends as witnesses, who testified that they did not hear me use the
language in question, and several of them, like Kernan of New York, declared that they had
occupied positions very near me, had given particular attention to my words, and would certainly
have remembered them if they had been uttered.  I kept cool, but asserted very positively that
I did use the exact words reported, and in proof of my statement I appealed to a number of
my friends, who sustained me by their distinct and positive recollections.  Here was a conflict
of testimony in which every witness recollected the facts according to his politics; but pending
the proceedings I was fortunate enough to find the notes of the "Globe" reporter, which perfectly
vindicated me from Mr. Mallory's charges, and suddenly put his bluster and billingsgate to
flight.  He unconditionally retracted his charges, while his swift witnesses were sufficiently
rebuked and humiliated by this unexpected catastrophe.  I was heartily complimented on my triumph,
and my dialogue with Mr. Mallory was put in pamphlet as a campaign document by his opponents
and liberally scattered over his district, where it did much service in defeating his re-election
to the House.

The passage of the Southern Homestead Bill, however, could only prove a very partial measure
without an enactment reaching the fee of rebel land owners, and I confidently anticipated the
endorsement of such a measure by the Republican National Convention, which was to meet in Baltimore,
on the seventh of June.  I was much gratified when the National Union League approved it, in
its Convention in that city the day before; and a resolution embodying it was also reported
favorably by the sub-committee on resolutions of the National Republican Convention the next
day.  But the General Committee, on the motion of McKee Dunn of Indiana, always an incorrigible
conservative, struck it out, much to the disappointment of the Republican masses.  To me it
was particularly vexatious, as the measure was a pet one of mine, having labored for it with
much zeal, and in the confidence that the National Convention would approve it.  Mr. Dunn was
a Kentuckian of the Border State School, and although a friend of mine, and an upright and
very gentlemanly man, he had a genius for being on the wrong side of vital questions during
the war.  Speaker Colfax used to say, laughingly, that in determining his own course he first
made it a point to find out where McKee Dunn stood; and then, having ascertained Julian's position,
he always took a middle ground, feeling perfectly sure he was right.

But to me the nomination of Andrew Johnson for Vice President was a still greater disappointment.
I knew he did not believe in the principles embodied in the platform.  I had become intimately
acquainted with him while we were fellow-members of the Committee on the Conduct of the War,
and he always scouted the idea that slavery was the cause of our trouble, or that emancipation
could ever be tolerated without immediate colonization.  In my early acquaintance with him
I had formed a different opinion; but he was, at heart, as decided a hater of the negro and
of everything savoring of abolitionism, as the rebels from whom he had separated.  His nomination,
however, like that of Mr. Lincoln, seemed to have been preordained by the people, while the
intelligent, sober men, in Congress and out of Congress, who lamented the fact, were not prepared
to oppose the popular will. During the month of June the feeling against Mr. Lincoln became
more and more bitter and intense, but its expression never found its way to the people.

Notwithstanding the divisions which existed in the Republican ranks, party discipline was vigorous
and absolute.  "Civil Service Reform" was in the distant future, and the attempt to inaugurate
it would have been counted next to treasonable.  Loyalty to Republicanism was not only accepted
as the best evidence of loyalty to the country, but of fitness for civil position.  After my
nomination for re- election this year, Mr. Holloway, who was still holding the position of
Commissioner of Patents, and one of the editors of a Republican newspaper in my district, refused
to recognize me as the party candidate, and kept the name of my defeated competitor standing
in his paper.  It threatened discord and mischief, and I went to the President with these facts,
and on the strength of them demanded his removal from office.  He replied, "If I remove Mr.
Holloway I shall have a quarrel with Senator Lane on my hands."  I replied that Senator Lane
would certainly not quarrel with him for turning a man out of office who was fighting the Republican
party and the friends of the Administration.  "Your nomination," said he, "is as binding on
Republicans as mine, and you can rest assured that Mr. Holloway shall support you, openly and
unconditionally, or lose his head."  This was entirely satisfactory, but after waiting a week
or two for the announcement of my name I returned to Mr. Lincoln with the information that
Mr. Holloway was still keeping up his fight, and that I had come to ask of him decisive measures.
I saw in an instant that the President now meant business.  He dispatched a messenger at once,
asking Mr. Holloway to report to him forthwith, in person, and in a few days my name was announced
in his paper as the Republican candidate, and that of my competitor withdrawn.

Having understood that Mr. Lincoln had changed his position respecting the power of Congress
to confiscate the landed estates of rebels, I called to see him on the subject on the 2d of
July, and asked him if I might say to the people that what I had learned on this subject was
true, assuring him that I could make a far better fight for our cause if he would permit me
to do so.  He replied that when he prepared his veto of our law on the subject two years before,
he had not examined the matter fully, but that on further reflection, and on reading Solicitor
Whiting's law argument, he had changed his opinion, and thought he would now sign a bill striking
at the fee, if we would send it to him.  I was much gratified by this statement, which was
of service to the cause in the canvass; but, unfortunately, constitutional scruples respecting
such legislation gained ground, and although both Houses of Congress at different times endorsed
the principle, it never became a law, owing to unavoidable differences between the President
and Congress on the question of reconstruction.  The action of the President in dealing with
the rebel land owners was of the most serious character.  It paralyzed one of the most potent
means of putting down the Rebellion, prolonging the conflict and aggravating its cost, and
at the same time left the owners of large estates in full possession of their lands at the
end of the struggle, who naturally excluded from the ownership of the soil the freedmen and
poor whites who had been friendly to the Union; while the confiscation of life estates as a
war measure was of no practical advantage to the Government or disadvantage to the enemy.

The refusal of the President to sign the Reconstruction Act which passed near the close of
the session, and his proclamation and message giving his reasons therefor, still further exasperated
a formidable body of earnest and impatient Republicans.  A scathing criticism of the President's
position by Henry Winter Davis, which was signed by himself and Senator Wade, fitly echoed
their feelings. Mr. Davis was a man of genius.  Among the famous men in the Thirty- eighth
Congress he had no superior as a writer, debater and orator. He was a brilliant man, whose
devotion to his country in this crisis was a passion, while his hostility to the President's
policy was as sincere as it was intense; but the passage of the somewhat incongruous bill vetoed
by the President, would probably have proved a stumbling-block in the way of the more radical
measures which afterward prevailed.  This could not then be foreseen, and as the measure was
an advanced one, the feeling against Mr. Lincoln waxed stronger and stronger among his opposers.
They had so completely lost their faith in him that when Congress adjourned they seriously
feared his veto of the bill just enacted, repealing the Fugitive Slave law; while the independent
movement in favor of General Fremont threatened a serious division in the Republican ranks,
and the triumph of General McClellan.  "These," as Mr. Lincoln said on another occasion, "were
dark and dismal days," and they were made still more so by the course of military events. 
The capture of Richmond, which General Grant had promised, had not been accomplished, although
he had been furnished with all the troops he wanted.  Our Grand Army of the Potomac made advances
in that direction, but with great slaughter and no actual results; while the Administration
was blamed for his failures.  General Grant finally reached the position occupied by McClellan
in 1862, but with terrific losses, and Richmond still in possession of the rebels.  His delay
and inaction at this point created great popular discontent in the North; but while Lincoln
supplied him with ample reinforcements, and he now had an army twice as large as that of General
Lee, which was costing the nation over a million dollars per day, he continued idle during
the summer.  It was evident that nothing could save us but military success; and most fortunately
for the Republican cause it came in due season, rallied and reunited its supporters, and thus
secured their triumph at the polls.

Near the close of the canvass, while on a visit to Washington, I learned how it happened that
Montgomery Blair had finally been got out of the Cabinet, and General Fremont induced to leave
the track as the candidate of the Cleveland Convention.  The radical pressure upon Mr. Lincoln
for the removal of Blair was very formidable, and the emergency seemed so critical that it
finally resulted in a compromise, by which Fremont agreed to retire from the race, if Blair
should be required to leave the Cabinet.  This was carried out, and thus, at last, the President
was obliged to make terms with the "Pathfinder," who achieved a long-coveted victory over an
old foe.  The election of Mr. Lincoln was followed by a remarkable measure of party union and
harmony, and the tone of his message in December was encouraging.  The appointment and confirmation
of Mr. Chase as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court met the most cordial approval of Republicans
everywhere.  As a healing measure, following his retirement from the treasury for valid reasons,
it was most timely.

During the month of December, the Committee on the Conduct of the War visited City Point, for
the purpose of taking testimony respecting the explosion of the mine at Petersburg.  General
Grant spent several hours with the Committee, speaking very freely and familiarly of the faults
and virtues of our various commanders, and impressing every one by his strong common sense.
While at dinner with us on our steamer, he drank freely, and its effect became quite manifest.
It was a painful surprise to the Committee, and was spoken of with bated breath; for he was
the Lieutenant-General of all our forces, and the great movements which finally strangled the
Rebellion were then in progress, and, for aught we knew, might possibly be deflected from their
purpose by his condition.

In January, 1865, the Committee on the Conduct of the War investigated the famous Fort Fisher
expedition, in which three hundred tuns of powder were to be exploded in the vicinity of the
Fort as a means of demolishing it, or paralyzing the enemy.  The testimony of General Butler
in explanation and defense of the enterprise was interesting and spicy, and he was subsequently
contradicted by General Grant on material points.  On the last day of this month one of the
grandest events of the century was witnessed in the House of Representatives in the final passage
of the Constitutional Amendment forever prohibiting slavery.  Numerous propositions on the
subject had been submitted, but the honor of drafting the one adopted belongs to Lyman Trumbull,
who had introduced it early in the first session of this Congress.  It passed the Senate on
the 8th of April, 1864, only six members voting against it, namely, Davis, Hendricks, McDougall,
Powell, Riddle and Saulsbury, but failed in the House on the 15th of June following.  It now
came up on the motion of Mr. Ashley to reconsider this vote.  Congress had abolished slavery
in the District of Columbia, and prohibited it in all the Territories.  It had repealed the
Fugitive Slave law, and declared free all negro soldiers in the Union armies and their families;
and the President had played his grand part in the Proclamation of Emancipation.  But the question
now to be decided completely overshadowed all others.  The debate on the subject had been protracted
and very spirited, the opposition being led by Pendleton, Fernando Wood, Voorhees, Mallory
and Eldridge, who all denied that the power to amend the Constitution conferred the right to
abolish slavery, as Garrett Davis and Saulsbury had done in the Senate.  The time for the momentous
vote had now come, and no language could describe the solemnity and impressiveness of the spectacle
pending the roll-call.  The success of the measure had been considered very doubtful, and depended
upon certain negotiations, the result of which was not fully assured, and the particulars of
which never reached the public.  The anxiety and suspense during the balloting produced a deathly
stillness, but when it became certainly known that the measure had prevailed the cheering in
the densely-packed hall and galleries surpassed all precedent and beggared all description.
Members joined in the general shouting, which was kept up for several minutes, many embracing
each other, and others completely surrendering themselves to their tears of joy.  It seemed
to me I had been born into a new life, and that the world was overflowing with beauty and joy,
while I was inexpressibly thankful for the privilege of recording my name on so glorious a
page of the nation's history, and in testimony of an event so long only dreamed of as possible
in the distant future. The champions of negro emancipation had merely hoped to speed their
grand cause a little by their faithful labors, and hand over to coming generations the glory
of crowning it with success; but they now saw it triumphant, and they had abundant and unbounded
cause to rejoice.  It has been aptly said that the greatest advantage of a long life is the
opportunity it gives of seeing moral experiments worked out, of being present at the fructification
of social causes, and of thus gaining a kind of wisdom which in ordinary cases seems reserved
for a future life; but that an equivalent for this advantage is possessed by such as live in
those critical periods of society when retribution is hastened, or displayed in clear connection
with the origin of events.  It strengthens faith to observe the sure operation of moral causes
in ripening into great and beneficent results.  To be permitted to witness the final success
of the grandest movement of ancient or modern times was a blessed opportunity. To have labored
for it in the goodly fellowship of its confessors and martyrs was cause for devout thanksgiving
and joy.  To be accredited to share in the great historic act of its formal consummation was
a priceless privilege.  A few days after the ratification of this Amendment, on the motion
of Mr. Sumner, Dr. Rock, a colored lawyer of Boston, was admitted to practice in the Supreme
Court of the United States, which had pronounced the Dred Scott decision only a few years before;
and this was followed a few days later by a sermon in the hall of the House by Rev. Mr. Garnett,
being the first ever preached in the Capitol by a colored man.  Evidently, the negro was coming
to the front.

In the latter part of March I visited New York, where I witnessed the immense throngs of shouting
people on Wall Street, called together by the news of the fall of Richmond.  Broadway, robed
in its innumerable banners, was one of the finest sights I had ever beheld.  On the tenth of
April the Committee on the Conduct of the War left Washington for South Carolina, for the purpose
of taking further testimony, and intending to be present at the great anniversary of the thirteenth
at Charleston.  We reached Fortress Monroe the next evening, where we learned that the "Alabama,"
which the Navy Department had furnished us, would be detained twenty-four hours to coal, by
reason of which we proceeded directly to Richmond on the "Baltimore."  At City Point, Admiral
Porter furnished us with a pilot, as there was some danger of torpedoes up the James River.
Our steamer reached the city about bedtime, but we remained on board till morning, lulled into
a sweep sleep by the music of the guitar and the singing of the negroes below.  At eight o'clock
in the morning our party went out sight-seeing, some in carriages, but most of us on horseback,
with an orderly for each to show him the way.  The first notable place we visited was General
Weitzel's headquarters, just vacated by Jefferson Davis.  The building was a spacious three-story
residence, with a large double parlor, a ladies' parlor, and a small secluded library attached,
in which all sorts of treason were said to have been hatched.  We next visited the capitol,
an ancient-looking edifice, which would bear no comparison with our modern State Capitols in
size or style of architecture.  The library made a respectable appearance, but I think it contained
few modern publications, especially of our own authors.  I noticed, however, a liberal supply
of theological works of the most approved orthodoxy.  The view of the city from the top of
the building was admirable.  We could see Libby Prison, Castle Thunder and Belle Isle, the
former of which we afterward visited. After seeing the rebel fortifications we were glad to
get back to our steamer.  Before starting the next morning we saw the "Richmond Whig," containing
an order signed by General Weitzel, inviting Hunter, McMullen and other noted rebel leaders,
including members of the rebel legislature, to meet in Richmond on the twenty-fifth to confer
with our authorities on the restoration of peace, transportation and safe conduct being ordered
for the purpose.  We were all thunderstruck, and fully sympathized with the hot indignation
and wrathful words of the chairman of our committee.  We soon afterwards learned that the order
had been directed by the President, and while we were thoroughly disgusted by this display
of misguided magnanimity we saw rebel officers strutting around the streets in full uniform,
looking as independent as if they had been masters of the city.  We left on the afternoon of
the twelfth, and were interested in seeing Drury's Landing, Dutch-Gap Canal, Malvern Hill and
other points of historic interest.  Before reaching Fortress Monroe the next day, Senators
Wade and Chandler changed their minds respecting our journey to Charleston, which was abandoned,
and after spending a few hours very pleasantly at that place and Point Lookout, we reached
Washington on the evening of the fourteenth.

Soon after retiring I was roused from a deep sleep by loud raps at my door.  W. L. Woods, clerk
of my committee, entered in the greatest excitement, and told me that Lincoln had just been
assassinated, and Seward and son probably, and that rebel assassins were about to take the
town.  Supposing all this to be true I grew suddenly cold, heart-sick and almost helpless.
It was a repetition of my experience when the exaggerated stories about the Bull Run disaster
first reached me in the summer of 1861.  I soon rallied, however, and joined the throng on
the street.  The city was at once in a tempest of excitement, consternation and rage.  About
seven and a half o'clock in the morning the church bells tolled the President's death.  The
weather was as gloomy as the mood of the people, while all sorts of rumors filled the air as
to the particulars of the assassination and the fate of Booth.  Johnson was inaugurated at
eleven o'clock on the morning of the 15th, and was at once surrounded by radical and conservative
politicians, who were alike anxious about the situation.  Aside from Mr. Lincoln's known policy
of tenderness to the Rebels, which now so jarred upon the feelings of the hour, his well-known
views on the subject of reconstruction were as distasteful as possible to radical Republicans.
In his last public utterance, only three days before his death, he had declared his adherence
to the plan of reconstruction announced by him in December, 1863, which in the following year
so stirred the ire of Wade and Winter Davis as an attempt of the Executive to usurp the powers
of Congress.  According to this plan the work of reconstruction in the rebel States was to
be inaugurated and carried on by those only who were qualified to vote under the Constitution
and laws of these States as they existed prior to the Rebellion. Of course the negroes of the
South could have no voice in framing the institutions under which they were to live, and the
question of negro suffrage would thus have been settled by the President, if he had lived and
been able to maintain this policy, while no doubt was felt that this calamity had now been
averted and the way opened for the radical policy which afterward involved the impeachment
of Johnson, but finally prevailed.  It was forgotten in the fever and turbulence of the moment,
that Mr. Lincoln, who was never an obstinate man, and who in the matter of his Proclamation
of Emancipation had surrendered his own judgment under the pressure of public opinion, would
not have been likely to wrestle with Congress and the country in a mad struggle for his own
way.  By the gods, there will be no trouble now in running the government!" The President thanked
him, and went on to define his well-remembered policy at that time.  "I hold," said he, "that
robbery is a crime; rape is a crime; murder is a crime; treason is a crime, and crime must
be punished.  Treason must be made infamous, and traitors must be impoverished."

In the meantime the prevailing excitement was greatly aggravated by the news of the capitulation
between General Sherman and General Johnston on the 16th of April.  Its practical surrender
of all the fruits of the national triumph so soon after the murder of the President, produced
an effect on the public mind which can not be described.  General Sherman had heard of the
assassination when the capitulation was made, and could not have been ignorant of the feeling
it had aroused.  On the face of the proceeding his action seemed a wanton betrayal of the country
to its enemies; but when this betrayal followed so swiftly the frightful tragedy which was
then believed to have been instigated by the Confederate authorities, the patience of the people
became perfectly exhausted.  For the time being, all the glory of his great achievements in
the war seemed to be forgotten in the anathemas which were showered upon him from every quarter
of the land; but the prompt repudiation of his stipulations by the Administration soon assuaged
the popular discontent, while it provoked an estrangement between Secretary Stanton and himself
which was never healed.

The outpouring of the people at Mr. Lincoln's funeral was wholly unprecedented, and every possible
arrangement was made by which they could manifest their grief for their murdered President;
but their solicitude for the state of the country was too profound to be intermitted.  What
policy was now to be pursued?  Mr. Lincoln's last utterances had been far from assuring or
satisfactory.  The question of reconstruction had found no logical solution, and all was confusion
respecting it.  The question of negro suffrage was slowly coming to the front, and could not
be much longer evaded. The adequate punishment of the rebel leaders was the demand of the hour.
What would the new President do?  He had suddenly become the central figure of American politics,
and both radicals and conservatives were as curious to know what line of policy he would follow
as they were anxious to point his way.  His demeanor, at first, seemed modest and commendable,
but his egotism soon began to assert itself, while his passion for stump-speaking was pampered
by the delegations which began to pour into the city from various States and flatter him by
formal addresses, to which he replied at length.  This business was kept up till the people
became weary of the din and clatter of words, and impatient for action.

On the twenty-first of April I joined a large crowd of Indianans in one of the calls on the
President referred to at the close of the last chapter.  Gov. Morton headed the movement, which
I now found had a decidedly political significance.  He read a lengthy and labored address
on "The Whole Duty of Man" respecting the question of Reconstruction.  He told the President
that a State could "neither secede nor by any possible means be taken out of the Union"; and
he supported and illustrated this proposition by some very remarkable statements.  He elaborated
the proposition that the loyal people of a State have the right to govern it; but he did not
explain what would become of the State if the people were all disloyal, or the loyal so few
as to be utterly helpless. The lawful governments of the South were overthrown by treason;
and the Governor declared there was "no power in the Federal Government to punish the people
of a State collectively, by reducing it to a territorial condition, since the crime of treason
is individual, and can only be treated individually."  According to this doctrine a rebellious
State become independent.  If the people could rightfully be overpowered by the national authority,
that very fact would at once re-clothe them in all their rights, just as if they had never
rebelled.  In framing their new governments Congress would have no right to prescribe any conditions,
or to govern them in any way pending the work of State reconstruction, since this would be
to recognize the States as Territories, and violate the principle of State rights.  The Governor's
theory of reconstruction, in fact, made our war for the Union flagrantly unconstitutional.
The crime of treason being "individual," and only to "be treated individually," we had no right
to hold prisoners of war, seize property, and capture and confiscate vessels, without a regular
indictment and trial; and this being so, every Rebel in arms was in the full legal possession
of his political rights, and no power could prevent him from exercising them except through
judicial conviction of treason in the district in which the overt act was committed.  Singularly
enough, he seemed entirely unaware of the well-settled principle which made our war for the
Union a territorial conflict, like that of a war with Mexico or England; that the Rebels, while
still liable to be hung or otherwise dealt with for treason, had taken upon themselves the
further character of public enemies; and that being now conquered they were conquered enemies,
having simply the rights of a conquered people.  The Governor further informed the President
that if the revolted districts should be dealt with as mere Territories, or conquered provinces,
the nation would be obliged to pay the debts contracted by them prior to the war.  These remarkable
utterances, which he repudiated in less than a year afterward, were emphatically endorsed by
the President, who entered upon the same theme at a dismal length, freely indulging in his
habit of bad English and incoherence of thought.  I was disgusted, and sorry that the confidence
of so many of my radical friends had been entirely misplaced.

During the latter part of April and early part of May the Committee on the Conduct of the War
completed its final report, making eight considerable volumes, and containing valuable material
for any trustworthy history of the great conflict.  Its opinions were sometimes colored by
the passions of the hour, and this was especially true in the case of General McClellan; but
subsequent events have justified its conclusions generally as to nearly every officer and occurrence
investigated, while its usefulness in exposing military blunders and incompetence, and in finally
inaugurating the vigorous war policy which saved the country, will scarcely be questioned by
any man sufficiently well-informed and fair-minded to give an opinion.

On the 12th of May, a caucus of Republicans was held at the National Hotel to consider the
necessity of taking decisive measures for saving the new Administration from the conservative
control which then threatened it.  Senators Wade and Sumner both insisted that the President
was in no danger, and declared, furthermore, that he was in favor of negro suffrage; and no
action was taken because of the general confidence in him which I was surprised to find still
prevailed.  In the meantime, pending the general drift of events, the suffrage question was
constantly gaining in significance, and demanding a settlement.  It was neither morally nor
logically possible to escape it; and on my return to my constituents I prepared for a thorough
canvass of my district.  The Republicans were everywhere divided on the question, while the
current of opinion was strongly against the introduction of the issue as premature. The politicians
all opposed it on the plea that it would divide the Republicans and restore the Democrats to
power, and that we must wait for the growth of a public opinion that would justify its agitation.
Governor Morton opposed the policy with inexpressible bitterness, declaring, with an oath,
that "negro suffrage must be put down," while every possible effort was made to array the soldiers
against it.  His hostility to the suffrage wing of his party seemed to be quite as relentless
as to the Rebels, while the great body of the Republicans of the district deferred strongly
to his views. In the beginning of the canvass I even found a considerable portion of my old
anti-slavery friends unprepared to follow me; but feeling perfectly sure I was right, and that
I could revolutionize the general opinion, I entered upon the work, and prosecuted it with
all my might for nearly four months.  My task was an arduous one, but I found the people steadily
yielding up their prejudices, and ready to lay hold of the truth when fairly and dispassionately
presented, while the soldiers were among the first to accept my teachings.  The tide was at
length so evidently turning in my favor that on the 28th of September Governor Morton was induced
to make his elaborate speech at Richmond, denouncing the whole theory of Republican reconstruction
as subsequently carried out, and opposing the policy of negro suffrage by arguments which he
seemed to regard as overwhelming.  He made a dismal picture of the ignorance and degradation
of the plantation negroes of the South, and scouted the policy of arming them with political
power.  But their fitness for the ballot was a subordinate question.  A great national emergency
pleaded for their right to it on other and far more imperative grounds.  The question involved
the welfare of both races, and the issues of the war.  It involved not merely the fate of the
negro, but the safety of society.  It was, moreover, a question of national honor and gratitude,
from which no escape was morally possible.  To leave the ballot in the hands of the ex- rebels,
and withhold it from these helpless millions, would be to turn them over to the unhindered
tyranny and misrule of their enemies, who were then smarting under the humiliation of their
failure, and making the condition of the freedmen more intolerable than slavery itself, through
local laws and police regulations.

The Governor referred to the Constitution and laws of Indiana, denying the ballot to her intelligent
negroes, and subjecting colored men to prosecution and fine for coming into the State; and
asked with what face her people could insist upon conferring the suffrage upon the negroes
of the Southern States?  But this was an evasion of the question.  The people of Indiana had
no right to take advantage of their own wrong, or to sacrifice the welfare of four million
blacks on the altar of Northern consistency.  He should have preached the duty of practical
repentance in Indiana, instead of making the sins of her people an excuse for a far greater
inhumanity to the negroes of the South.

He urged that the policy of negro suffrage would give the lie to all the arguments that had
ever been employed against slavery as degrading and brutalizing to its victims.  He said it
was "to pay the highest compliment to the institution of slavery," and "stultify ourselves."
But this was belittling a great national question, by the side of which all considerations
of party consistency were utterly trivial and contemptible.  The ballot for the negro was a
logical necessity, and it was a matter of the least possible consequence whether the granting
of it would "stultify ourselves" or not.

He insisted that the true policy was to give the Southern negroes a probation of fifteen or
twenty years to prepare for the ballot. He would give them "time to acquire a little property;
time to get a little education; time to learn something about the simplest forms of business,
and to prepare themselves for the exercise of political power."  But he did not explain how
all this was to be done, under the circumstances of their condition.  He declared that not
one of them in five hundred could read, or was worth five dollars in property of any kind,
owning nothing but their bodies, and living on the plantations of white men upon whom they
were dependent for employment and subsistence.  How could such men acquire "education," and
"property," under the absolute sway of a people who regarded them with loathing and contempt?
Who would grant them this "probation," and help them turn it to good account? Was some miracle
to be wrought through which the slave-masters were to be transfigured into negro apostles and
devotees?  Besides, under Governor Morton's theory of reconstruction and State rights, neither
Congress nor the people of the loyal States had anything to do with the question.  It was no
more their concern in South Carolina than in Massachusetts.  His suggestion of a probation
for Southern negroes was therefore an impertinence.  If not, why did he not recommend a "probation"
for the hordes of "white trash" that were as unfit for political power as the negroes?

He was very earnest and eloquent in his condemnation of Mr. Sumner for proposing to give the
ballot to the negroes and disfranchise the white Rebels, but his moral vision failed to discern
anything amiss in his own ghastly policy of arming the white Rebels with the ballot and denying
it to the loyal negroes.

He argued that the right to vote carried with it the right to hold office, and that negro suffrage
would lead to the election of negro Governors, negro judges, negro members of Congress, a negro
balance of power in our politics, and a war of races.  He seemed to have no faith at all in
the beneficent measures designed to guard the black race from outrage and wrong, while full
of apprehension that the heavens would fall if such measures were adopted.

This speech was published in a large pamphlet edition and extensively scattered throughout
the country; but it proved a help rather than a hindrance to my enterprise.  I replied to it
in several incisive newspaper articles, and made its arguments a text for a still more thorough
discussion of the issue on the stump, and at the close of my canvass the Republicans of the
district were as nearly a unit in my favor as a party can be made respecting any controverted
doctrine.

I now extended my labors briefly outside of my district, and by special invitation from citizens
of Indianapolis and members of the Legislature, then in session, I spoke in that city on the
17th of November.  Every possible effort was made by the Johnsonized Republicans to prevent
me from having an audience, but they failed utterly; and I analyzed the positions of Governor
Morton in a speech of two hours, which was reported for the "Cincinnati Gazette" and subsequently
published in a large pamphlet edition.  The political rage and exasperation which now prevailed
in the ranks of the Anti- Suffrage faction can be more readily imagined than described. Their
organ, the "Indianapolis Journal," poured out upon me an incredible deliverance of vituperation
and venom for scattering my heresies outside of my Congressional district, declaring that I
had "the temper of a hedgehog, the adhesiveness of a barnacle, the vanity of a peacock, the
vindictiveness of a Corsican, the hypocrisy of Aminadab Sleek and the duplicity of the devil."
I rather enjoyed these paroxysms of malignity, which broke out all over the State among the
Governor's conservative satellites, since my only offense was fidelity to my political opinions,
the soundness of which I was finding fully justified by events; for the friends of the Governor,
in a few short months, gathered together and cremated all the copies of his famous speech which
could be found.  But the disowned document was printed as a campaign tract by the Democrats
for a dozen successive years afterward, and circulated largely in several of the Northern States,
while the Governor himself, by a sudden and splendid somersault, became the champion and exemplar
of the very heresies which had so furiously kindled his ire against me.  These performances
are sufficiently remarkable to deserve notice.  They did much to make Indiana politics spicy
and picturesque, and showed how earnestly the radical and conservative wings of the Republican
party could wage war against the common enemy without in the least impairing their ability
or disposition to fight each other.

I have referred to these facts because they form a necessary part of the story I am telling.
The question of Negro Suffrage was a very grave one, and the circumstances connected with its
introduction as a political issue are worthy of record; while Governor Morton was a sort of
phenomenal figure in American politics during the war period, and played a very remarkable
part in the affairs of Indiana.  It has aptly been said of him, and not by an enemy, that his
inconsistencies, in a study of his character, form the most charming part of it, and that no
man in public life ever brought such magnificent resources to the support of both sides of
a question.  His force of will was as matchless as his ambition for power was boundless and
unappeasable.  He was made for revolutionary times, and his singular energy of character was
pre-eminently destructive; but it can not be denied that his services to the country in this
crisis were great.  Mr. Von Holst, in his "Constitutional and Political History of the United
States," has a chapter on "The Reign of Andrew Jackson."  When the history of Indiana shall
be written, it might fitly contain a chapter on "The Reign of Oliver P. Morton."  He made himself
not merely the master of the Democratic party of the State, and of its Rebel element, but of
his own party as well.  His will, to a surprising extent, had the force of law in matters of
both civil and military administration.  His vigor in action and great personal magnetism so
rallied the people to his support, that with the rarest exceptions the prominent leaders of
his party quietly succumbed to his ambition, and recoiled from the thought of confronting him,
even where they believed him in the wrong.

His hostility to me began with my election to Congress in 1849, in which, as a Free Soiler,
I had the united support of the Democratic party of my district, of which he was then a member.
I never obtained his forgiveness for my success in that contest, and his unfriendliness was
afterward aggravated by his failure as a Republican leader to supplant me in the district,
and it continued to the end. I knew him from his boyhood.  We resided in the same village nearly
twenty years, and began our acquaintance as members of the same debating club.  For years we
were intimate and attached friends, and I believe no man was before me in appreciating his
talents and predicting for him a career of political distinction and usefulness. During the
war, earnest efforts were made by his friends and mine looking to a reconciliation, and the
restoration of that harmony in the party which good men on both sides greatly coveted; but
all such efforts necessarily failed.  If I had been willing to subordinate my political convictions
and sense of duty to his ambition, peace could at once have been restored; but as this was
impossible, I was obliged to accept the warfare which continued and increased, and which I
always regretted and deplored.  I only make these statements in justice to the truth.

The bill providing for negro suffrage in the District of Columbia was among the first important
measures of the Thirty-ninth Congress. The debate upon it in January, 1866, was singularly
able and thorough, and gave strong evidence of political progress.  All efforts to postpone
the measure, or make the suffrage restrictive, were voted down, and on the announcement of
its passage the cheering was tremendous.  Beginning on the floor, it was quickly caught up
by the galleries, and the scene resembled that which followed the passage of the Constitutional
Amendment already referred to.  The majority was over two to one, thus clearly foreshadowing
the enfranchisement of the negro in the insurrectionary districts.  I believe only two of my
colleagues voted with me for its passage.

The question of reconstruction was brought directly before Congress by the report of the joint
select committee on that subject, submitting the Fourteenth Constitutional Amendment.  The
second section of the Amendment was a measure of compromise, and attempted to unite the radical
and conservative wings of the party by restricting the right of representation in the South
to the basis of suffrage, instead of extending that basis in conformity to the right of representation.
It was a proposition to the Rebels that if they would agree that the negroes should not be
counted in the basis of representation, we would hand them over, unconditionally, to the tender
mercies of their old masters.  It sanctioned the barbarism of the Rebel State Governments in
denying the right of representation to their freedmen, simply because of their race and color,
and thus struck at the very principle of Democracy.  It was a scheme of cold-blooded treachery
and ingratitude to a people who had contributed nearly two hundred thousand soldiers to the
armies of the Union, and among whom no traitor had ever been found; and it was urged as a means
of securing equality of white representation in the Government when that object could have
been perfectly attained by a constitutional amendment arming the negroes of the South with
the ballot, instead of leaving them in the absolute power of their enemies.  Of course, no
man could afford to vote against the proposition to cut down rebel representation to the basis
of suffrage; but to recognize the authority of these States to make political outlaws of their
colored citizens and incorporate this principle into the Constitution of the United States,
was a wanton betrayal of justice and humanity.  Congress, however, was unprepared for more
thorough work.  The conservative party which had so long sought to spare slavery was obliged,
as usual, to feel its way cautiously, and wait on the logic of events; while the negro, as
I shall show, was finally indebted for his franchise to the desperate madness of his enemies
in rejecting the dishonorable proposition of his friends.

As the question of reconstruction became more and more engrossing, the signs of a breach between
the President and Congress revealed themselves.  He had disappointed the hopes of his radical
friends, and begun to show his partiality for conservative and Democratic ideas.  His estrangement
from his party probably had its genesis in the unfortunate exhibition of himself at the inauguration
of Mr. Lincoln, and the condemnation of it by leading Republicans, which he could not forget.
Instead of keeping his promise to be the "Moses" of the colored people he turned his back upon
them in a very offensive public speech.  His veto of the Freedmen's Bureau bill finally stripped
him of all disguises, and placed him squarely against Congress and the people, while the House
met his defiance by a concurrent resolution emphatically condemning his reconstruction policy,
and thus opening the way for the coming struggle between Executive usurpation and the power
of Congress.  His maudlin speech on the 22d of February to the political mob which called on
him, branding as traitors the leaders of the party which had elected him, completely dishonored
him in the opinion of all Republicans, and awakened general alarm.  Everybody could now see
the mistake of his nomination at Baltimore, and that he was simply a narrow- minded dogmatist
and a bull-dog in disposition, who would do anything in his power to thwart the wishes of his
former friends.

During the month of March of this year, at the request of intelligent working men in the employ
of the Government, I introduced a bill making eight hours a day's work in the navy yards of
the United States.  This was the beginning of the eight hour agitation in Congress.  I had
not given much thought to the necessity for such legislation in this country, but the proposed
measure seemed to me an augury of good to the working classes, as the Ten Hour movement had
proved itself to be twenty years before.  It could plead the time laws of England as a precedent,
enacted to protect humanity against the "Lords of the Loom."  These laws recognized labor as
capital endowed with human needs, and entitled to the special guardianship of the State, and
not as merchandise merely, to be governed solely by the law of supply and demand.  While I
was a believer in Free Trade, I was not willing to follow its logic in all cases of conflict
between capital and labor.  My warfare against chattel slavery and the monopoly of the soil
had assumed the duty of the Government to secure fair play and equal opportunities to the laboring
masses, and I was willing to embody that idea in a specific legislative proposition, and thus
invite its discussion and the settlement of it upon its merits.

In April of this year a notable passage at arms occurred in the House between Mr. Conkling
and Mr. Blaine, which has been made historic by the subsequent career of these great Republican
chiefs. The altercation between them was protracted and very personal, and grew out of the
official conduct of Provost Marshal General Fry. The animosity engendered between these rivals
at this early day seems never to have been intermitted, and it can best be appreciated by referring
to the closing passages of their remarkable war of words on the 30th of this month.  Mr. Conkling's
language was very contemptuous, and in concluding he said:

"If the member from Maine had the least idea of how profoundly indifferent I am to his opinion
upon the subject which he has been discussing, or upon any other subject personal to me, I
think he would hardly take the trouble to rise here and express his opinion. And as it is a
matter of entire indifference to me what that opinion may be, I certainly will not detain the
House by discussing the question whether it is well or ill-founded, or by noticing what he
says. I submit the whole matter to the members of the House, making, as I do, an apology (for
I feel that it is due to the House) for the length of time which I have been occupied in consequence
of being drawn into explanations, originally by an interruption which I pronounced the other
day ungentlemanly and impertinent, and having nothing whatever to do with the question."

Mr. Blaine, in reply, referred to Mr. Conkling's "grandiloquent swell" and his "turkey gobbler
strut," and concluded:

"I know that within the last five weeks, as members of the House will recollect, an extra strut
has characterized the gentleman's bearing.  It is not his fault.  It is the fault of another.
That gifted and satirical writer, Theodore Tilton, of the 'New York Independent,' spent some
weeks recently in this city.  His letters published in that paper, embraced, with many serious
statements, a little jocose satire, a part of which was the statement that the mantle of the
late Winter Davis had fallen upon the member from New York.  Shade of the mighty Davis, forgive
the almost profanation of that jocose satire!"

This uncomely sparring match seemed to have no significance at the time beyond the amusement
it afforded and the personal discredit it attached to the combatants; but in its later consequences
it has not only seriously involved the political fortunes of both these ambitious men, but
rent the Republican party itself into warring factions.  Still more, it has connected itself
in the same way, and not very remotely, with the nomination of General Garfield in 1880, and
his subsequent assassination.  Such are the strange political revenges of a personal quarrel.

During this session of Congress the policy of Military Land Bounties was very earnestly agitated,
and threatened the most alarming consequences.  Probably no great question has been so imperfectly
understood by our public men as the land question, and the truth of this is attested by the
multiplied schemes of pillage and plunder to which the public domain has been exposed within
the past thirty or forty years.  Among these the project of Land Bounties to soldiers has been
conspicuous.  Of the millions of acres disposed of by the Government through assignable land-warrants
in the pretended interest of the soldiers of the Mexican War a very small fraction was appropriated
to their use.  The great body of the land fell into the hands of monopolists, who thus hindered
the settlement and productive wealth of the country, while the sum received by the soldier
for his warrant was in very many cases a mere mockery of his just claims, and in no instance
an adequate bounty.  The policy, however, had become traditional, and now, at the close of
the grandest of all our wars, it was quite natural for the country's defenders to claim its
supposed benefits.  Congress was flooded with their petitions, and it required uncommon political
courage to oppose their wishes.  It was very plausibly urged that the Nation, with its heavy
load of debt, could not pay a bounty in money, and that it should be done by drawing liberally
upon the thousand million acres of the public domain.  Some of the advocates of this policy
openly favored the repeal of the Homestead law for this purpose, just as Thurlow Weed, earlier
in the war, had demanded its repeal so that our public lands could be mortgaged to European
capitalists in security for the money we needed to carry on the struggle.  The situation became
critical.  Everybody was eager to reward the soldier, and especially the politicians; and there
seemed to be no other way to do it than by bounties in land, for which all our previous wars
furnished precedents.  The House Committee on Public Lands considered the question with great
care and anxiety, and in the hope of check-mating that project made a report in response to
one of the many petitions for land bounty which had been referred to it, embodying some very
significant facts.  It showed that more than two millions and a quarter of soldiers would be
entitled to a bounty in land, and that it would require more than one third of the public domain
remaining undisposed of, and cover nearly all of it that was really fit for agriculture; that
the warrants would undoubtedly be made assignable, as in the case of previous bounties, and
that land speculation would thus find its new birth and have free course in its dreadful ravages;
and that it would prove the practical overthrow of the policy of our pre-emption and homestead
laws and turn back the current of American civilization and progress.  The report further insisted
that the Nation could not honorably plead poverty in bar of the great debt it owed its defenders,
and it was accompanied by a bill providing a bounty in money at the rate of eight and one third
dollars per month for the time of their service, which was drawn after conferring with intelligent
men among them who fully appreciated the facts and arguments of the committee.  This report
and its accompanying bill had an almost magical effect.  They not only perfectly satisfied
the soldiers everywhere, but revolutionized the opinion of both Houses of Congress, and thus
saved the public domain from the wholesale spoilation that had threatened it.  The bill was
referred to the Military Committee, and afterward became well known by its title of "General
Schenck's bill."  It passed the House, but failed in the Senate.  It passed the House repeatedly
at different session of Congress afterward, although it never became a law; but it was the
timely and fortunate instrument through which the public domain was saved from the wreck which
menaced it in the hasty adoption of a scheme which would have proved as worthless to our soldiers
as disastrous to the country.

The action of the Government in dealing with the mineral lands of the United States forms one
of the most curious chapters in the history of legislation.  It had its beginning in the famous
Congressional Ordinance of May 20, 1785, which reserved one third part of all gold, silver,
lead and copper mines to be sold or otherwise disposed of as Congress might direct.  From this
time till the discovery of gold in California in 1848, the legislation of Congress respecting
mineral lands related exclusively to those containing the base or merely useful metals, and
applied only to the regions now embraced by the States of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois
and Missouri.  The policy of reserving mineral lands from sale was obviously of feudal origin,
and naturally led to the leasing of such lands by the Government, which was inaugurated by
the Act of Congress of March 3, 1807.  The Act of Congress of March 3, 1829, provided for the
sale of the reserved lead mines and contiguous lands in Missouri, on six months' notice, but
mineral lands elsewhere remained reserved, and continued to be leased by the Government.  This
policy was thoroughly and perseveringly tried, and proved utterly unprofitable and ruinous.
President Polk, in his message of December 2, 1845, declared that the income derived from the
leasing system for the years 1841, 1842, 1843 and 1844 was less than one fourth of its expense,
and he recommended its abolition, and that these lands be brought into market.  The leasing
policy drew into the mining regions a population of vagrants, idlers and gamblers, who resisted
the payment of tax on the product of the mines, and defied the agents of the Government.  It
excluded sober and intelligent citizens, and hindered the establishment of organized communities
and the development of the mines.  The miners were violently opposed to the policy of sale,
but the evils incident to the leasing policy became so intolerable that the Government was
at length obliged to provide for the sale of the lands in fee, which it did by Acts of Congress
of July 11, 1846, and March 1 and 3, 1847.  The tracts occupied and worked by the miners under
their leases possessed every variety of shape and boundary, but there were no difficulties
which were not readily adjusted under the rectangular system of surveys and the regulations
of the Land Department.  A new class of men at once took possession of these regions as owners
of the soil, brought their families with them, laid the foundations of social order, expelled
the semi-barbarians who had secured a temporary occupancy, and thus, at once promoted their
own welfare, the prosperity of the country, and the financial interests of the Government.
Under this reformed policy the lead and copper lands of the regions named were disposed of in fee.

But the gold-bearing regions covered by our Mexican acquisitions created a new dispensation
in mining, and invited the attention of Congress to the consideration of a new and exceedingly
important question.  How should these mineral lands be disposed of?  They covered an area of
a million square miles, and their exploration and development became a matter of the most vital
moment, not only in a financial point of view, but as a means of promoting the settlement and
tillage of the agricultural lands contiguous to the mineral deposits.  President Fillmore,
in his message of December 2, 1849, recommended the sale of these lands in small parcels, and
Mr. Ewing, his Secretary of the Interior, urged upon Congress the consideration of the subject,
and recommended the policy of leasing them; but no attention seems to have been given to these
recommendations. By Act of Congress of September 27, 1850, mineral lands in Oregon were reserved
from sale; and by Acts of March 3, 1853, and of July 22, 1854, they were reserved in California
and New Mexico.  This was the extent of Congressional action.  Early in the late war, the Secretary
of the Interior, Hon. Caleb B. Smith, referred to the question, and the Commissioner of the
General Land Office afterward repeatedly recommended the policy of leasing, but Congress took
no notice of the subject.  My interest in the question was first awakened in the fall of 1864,
in carefully overhauling our land policy.  Our mineral lands for more than sixteen years had
been open to all comers from whatever quarter of the globe, during which time more than a thousand
million dollars had been extracted, from which not a dollar of revenue reached the National
Treasury save the comparatively trifling amount derived from the Internal Revenue tax on bullion.
This fact was so remarkable that it was difficult to accept it as true.  The Government had
no policy whatever in dealing with these immense repositories of national wealth, and declined
to have any; for a policy implies that something is to be done, and points out the method of
doing it.  It had prohibited the sale of mineral lands, and then come to a dead halt.

The case was a very curious one, and the more I considered it, the more astonished I became
at the strange indifference of the Government, and that no public man of any party had ever
given the subject the slightest attention.  The Nation had been selling its lands containing
iron, copper and lead, and the policy of vesting an absolute fee in individual proprietors
had been accepted on actual trial, and after the leasing policy had signally failed, and I
could see nothing in the distinction between the useful and precious metals which required
a different policy for the latter. Some policy was absolutely demanded.  The country, loaded
down by a great and continually increasing war debt, could not afford to turn away from so
tempting a source of revenue.  To sleep over its grand opportunity was as stupid as it was
criminal.  It was obvious that if the Government continued to reserve these lands from sale,
some form of tax or royalty on their products must be resorted to as a measure of financial
policy; but this would have involved the same political anomaly as the policy of leasing, and
the same failure.  In principle it was the same.  To retain the fee of the lands in the Government
and impose a rent upon their occupiers, would make the Government a great landlord, and the
miners its tenants.  Such a policy would not be American, but European.  It would not be Democratic,
but Feudal.  It would be to follow the Governments of the Old World, which reserve their mineral
lands for the Crown, because they are esteemed too precious for the people.  It was at war
with our theory of Democracy, which has respect chiefly to the individual, and seeks to strengthen
the Government by guarding his rights and promoting his well-being. These considerations convinced
me that the time had come to abandon the non-action course of the Government, and adopt a policy
in harmony with our general legislation; and that the survey and sale of these lands in fee
was the best and only method of promoting security of titles, permanent settlements, and thorough
development. As early as December, 1864, I therefore introduced a bill embodying this policy,
which was followed by a similar measure, early in the Thirty-ninth Congress, accompanied by
an elaborate report, arguing the question pretty fully, and combating all the objections to
the principle and policy of sale.  My views were commended by Secretary McCullough, as they
had been by Mr. Chase, while I was glad to find them supported by intelligent men from California,
who spoke from actual observation and extensive experience in mining.

But although this measure fully protected all miners in the right of exploration and discovery,
and carefully guarded against any interference with vested rights, the idea was in some way
rapidly and extensively propagated that it contemplated a sweeping confiscation of all their
claims, and the less informed among them became wild with excitement.  The politicians of California
and Nevada, instead of endeavoring to enlighten them and quiet this excitement, yielded to
it absolutely.  They became as completely its instruments as they have since been of the Anti-Mongolian
feeling.  They argued, at first, that no Congressional legislation was necessary, and that
while the Government should retain the fee of these lands, the miners should have the entire
control of them under regulations prescribed by themselves.  This, it was believed, would placate
the miners and settle the question; but the introduction of the measure referred to, and the
agitation of the question, had made some form of legislation inevitable, and the question now
was to determine what that legislation should be.  Senators Conness of California, and Stewart
of Nevada, who were exceedingly hostile to the bill I had introduced, and feared its passage,
sought to avert it by carrying through the Senate "a bill to regulate the occupation of mineral
lands and to extend the right of pre-emption thereto," which they hoped would satisfy their
constituents and prevent further legislation.  They supported it as the next best thing to
total non-action by Congress.  It provided for giving title to the miners, but it did this
by practically abdicating the jurisdiction of the National Government over these lands, with
its recognized and well-settled machinery for determining all questions of title and boundary,
and handing them over to "the local custom or rules of the miners."  These "local rules" were
to govern the miner in the location, extension and boundary of his claim, the manner of developing
it, and the survey also, which was not to be executed with any reference to base lines as in
the case of other public lands, but in utter disregard of the same.  The Surveyor General was
to make a plat or diagram of the claim, and transmit it to the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, who, as the mere agent and clerk of the miner, with no judicial authority whatever,
was required to issue the patent.  In case of any conflict between claimants it was to be determined
by the "local courts," without any right of appeal to the local land offices, the General Land
Office, or to the Federal courts.  The Government was thus required to part with its lands
by proceedings executed by officials wholly outside of its jurisdiction, and irresponsible
to its authority. The act not only abolished our rectangular system of surveys, but still further
insulted the principles of mathematics and the dictates of common sense by providing that the
claimant should have the right to follow his vein or lode, "with its dips, angles and variations
to any depth, although it may enter the land adjoining, which land adjoining shall be sold
subject to this condition"; a right unknown to the mining codes of England, France or Prussia,
and not sanctioned by those of Spain or Mexico.  Subject to this novel principle the crudely
extemporized rules of the miners were to be recognized as law, and this system of instability
and uncertainty made the basis of title and the arbiter of all disputes, instead of sweeping
it away and ushering in a system of permanence and peace through the well-appointed agency
of the Land Department. It was easy to see that this was an act to encourage litigation and
for the benefit of lawyers, and not to promote the real interest of the miners or increase
the product of the mines.

This was made perfectly clear at the time, by the report of a Senate committee of the Legislature
of Nevada.  In speaking of the local laws of the miners, it says, "There never was confusion
worse confounded.  More than two hundred districts within the limit of a single State, each
with its self-approved code; these codes differing not alone each from the other, but presenting
numberless instances of contradiction in themselves.  The law of one point is not the law of
another five miles distant, and a little further on will be a code which is the law of neither
of the former, and so on, ad inifitum; with the further disturbing fact superadded, that the
written laws themselves may be overrun by some peculiar custom which can be found nowhere recorded,
and the proof of which will vary with the volume of interested affidavits which may be brought
on either side to establish it.  Again, in one district the work to be done to hold a claim
is nominal, in another exorbitant, in another abolished, in another adjourned from year to
year.  A stranger, seeking to ascertain the law, is surprised to learn that there is no satisfactory
public record to which he can refer; no public officer to whom he may apply, who is under any
bond or obligation to furnish him information, or guarantee its authenticity. Often, in the
new districts, he finds there is not even the semblance of a code, but a simple resolution
adopting the code of some other district, which may be a hundred miles distant.  What guarantee
has he for the investment of either capital or labor under such a system?"  The report proceeds
to show that these regulations can have no permanency.  "A miners' meeting," it declares, "adopts
a code; it stands apparently as the law.  Some time after, on a few days' notice, a corporal's
guard assembles, and, on simple motion, radically changes the whole system by which claims
may be held in a district.  Before a man may traverse the State, the laws of a district, which
by examination and study he may have mastered, may be swept away, and no longer stand as the
laws which govern the interest he may have acquired; and the change has been one which by no
reasonable diligence could he be expected to have knowledge of."  Of course these facts thus
officially stated in the interest of the miners of Nevada, were applicable to California, and
all the mining States and Territories, and they fitly and very forcibly rebuked the attempt
to enact the Senate bill.

When this bill reached the House it was properly referred to the Committee on Public Lands,
which then had under consideration the bill I had reported providing for the survey and sale
of mineral lands through the regular machinery of the Land Department.  The House Committee
subsequently reported it favorably, and could not be persuaded by the delegations from California
and Nevada to adopt the Senate bill as a substitute.  Senators Stewart and Conness, finding
their project thus baffled, and becoming impatient of delay as the session neared its close,
called up a House bill entitled "An Act granting the right of way to ditch and canal owners
over the Public Lands in the States of California, Oregon and Nevada," and succeeded, by sharp
practice, in carrying a motion to strike out the whole of the bill except the enacting clause,
and insert the bill which the Senate had already enacted and was then before the House Committee.
This maneuver succeeded, and the bill, thus enacted by the Senate a second time, and now under
a false title, was sent to the House, where it found its place on the Speaker's table, and
was lying in wait for the sudden and unlooked-for movement which was to follow.  The title
was misleading, and thus enabled Mr. Ashley of Nevada, to obtain the floor when it was reached,
and under the gag, which of course would cut off all amendment and debate, he attempted to
force through a measure revolutionizing the whole land policy of the Government so far as relates
to the Western side of the continent, and surrendering the national authority over its vast
magazines of mineral wealth to the legalized jargon and bewilderment I have depicted.  I succeeded
in preventing a vote by carrying an adjournment, but the question came up the next day, and
the Senators referred to, with their allies in the House, had used such marvelous industry
in organizing and drilling their forces, and the majority of the members knew so little about
the question involved, that I found the chances decidedly against me.  I was obliged, also,
to encounter a prevailing but perfectly unwarranted presumption that the representatives of
the mining States were the best judges of the question in dispute, while it was foolishly regarded
as a local one, with which the old States had no concern.  The clumsy and next to incomprehensible
bill thus became a law, and by legislative methods as indefensible as the measure itself.

Such is the history of this remarkable experiment in legislation; but it is an experiment no
longer.  Its character has been perfectly established by time, and the logic of actual facts.
It has been extensively and thoroughly tried, and after repeated attempts to amend it by supplementary
legislation, its failure stands recorded in the manifold evils it has wrought.  The Land Commission,
appointed under the administration of President Hayes in pursuance of an Act of Congress to
classify the Public Lands and codify the laws relating to their disposition, visited the mining
States and Territories in detail, and devoted ample time to the examination of witnesses and
experts in every important locality touching the policy and practical operation of the laws
in force relating to mineral lands.  This Commission condemned these laws on the strength of
overwhelming evidence, and recommended a thorough and radical reform, including the reference
of all disputed questions as to title and boundary to the regular officials of the United States;
the abolition of the "local custom or rules of miners," with the "local courts" provided for
their adjudication; and the adoption of the United States surveys as far as practicable, including
the geodetical principle of ownership in lieu of the policy of allowing the miner to follow
his vein, "with its dips, angles and variations under the adjoining land of his neighbor,"
which policy is declared to be the source of incalculable legislation.  The Commission, in
short, urged the adoption of the principles of the Common Law and the employment of the appropriate
machinery of the Land Department, as a substitute for the frontier regulations which Congress
made haste to nationalize in 1866.  It declared that under these regulations "title after title
hangs on a local record which may be defective, mutilated, stolen for blackmail, or destroyed
to accomplish fraud, and of which the grantor, the Government, has neither knowledge nor control";
that in the evidence taken "it was repeatedly shown that two or three prospectors, camped in
the wilderness, have organized a mining district, prescribed regulations involving size of
claims, mode of location and nature of record, elected one of their number recorder, and that
officer, on the back of an envelope, or on the ace of spades grudgingly spared from his pack,
can make with the stump of a lead pencil an entry that the Government recognizes as the inception
of a title which may convey millions of dollars; that even when the recorder is duly elected
he is not responsible to the United States, is neither bonded nor under oath, may falsify or
destroy his record, may vitiate the title to millions of dollars, and snap his fingers in the
face of the Government; and that our present mining law might fitly be entitled 'An Act to
cause the Government to join, upon unknown terms, with an unknown second party, to convey to
a third party an illusory title to an indefinite thing, and encourage the subsequent robbery
thereof.'"

These strong statements are made by a Government commission composed of able and impartial
men, who were guided in their patient search after the truth by the evidence of "a cloud of
witnesses," who spoke from personal knowledge and experience.  The character of our mining
laws is therefore not a matter of theory, but of demonstrated fact.  They scourge the mining
States and Territories with the unspeakable curse of uncertainty of land titles, as everywhere
attested by incurable litigation and strife.  They thus undermine the morals of the people,
and pave the way for violence and crime.  They cripple a great national industry and source
of wealth, and insult the principles of American jurisprudence.  And the misfortune of this
legislation is heightened by the probability of its continuance; for it is not easy to uproot
a body of laws once accepted by a people, however mischievous in their character. Custom, and
the faculty of adaptation, have a very reconciling influence upon communities as well as individuals.
Moreover, men absorbed in a feverish and hazardous industry, and stimulated by the hope of
sudden wealth, are not disposed to consider the advantages of permanent ownership and security
of title.  Their business is to make their locations according to local custom, and sell out
to the capitalists; while the men who feel the burden of litigation and the evil of uncertain
titles, are not the men who control public opinion and influence the course of legislation.
It may thus happen that a system of laws initiated by itinerant miners solely for the protection
of their transient posessory interests, and carried through Congress at their behest by parliamentary
roguery, may be permanently engrafted upon half the continent.  If California had been contiguous
to the older States, and her mining operations had only kept pace with the progress of settlements,
or if her representatives had been less ready to sacrifice the enduring interests of their
constituents for temporary and selfish ends, the wretched travesty of law which now afflicts
the States and Territories of the West would have been unknown, and the same code and forms
of administration would have prevailed from the lakes to the Pacific.

The lesson of this vital mistake is a pregnant one.  The laws regulating the ownership and
disposition of landed property not only affect the well-being but frequently the destiny of
a people. The system of primogeniture and entail adopted by the Southern States of our Union
favored the policy of great estates, and the ruinous system of landlordism and slavery which
finally laid waste the fairest and most fertile section of the republic and threatened its
life; while the New England States, in adopting a different system, laid the foundations of
their prosperity in the soil itself, and "took a bond of fate" for the welfare of unborn generations.
Their political institutions were the logical outcome of their laws respecting landed property,
which favored a great subdivision of the land and great equality among the people, thus promoting
prosperous cultivation, compact communities, general education, a healthy public opinion, democracy
in managing the affairs of the church, and that system of local self government which has since
prevailed over so many States.  So intimate and vital are the relations between a community
and the soil it occupies that in the nomenclature of politics the word "people" and "land"
are convertible terms; but no people can prosper under any system of land tenures which tolerates
a vexatious uncertainty of title, and thus prompts every man to become the enemy of his neighbor
in the scuffle for his rights.  Such a state of affairs is worse than pestilence or famine;
but the evil of uncertain titles puts on new and very aggravated forms in our gold-bearing
regions.  The business of mining naturally awakens the strongest passions.  It sharpens the
faculties and dulls the conscience.  It gives to cupidity its keenest edge.  Its prizes are
often rich and suddenly gained, and when they are sought through the forms of a law which compels
a man to choose between an expensive and hazardous litigation and robbery, human nature is
severely tried.  No situation could well be more deplorable than that which obliges a man to
pay heavy black- mail as the only means of saving his property from legal confiscation by another;
and the moral ravages of a code which allows this can not be computed.  It tempts civilized
men to become savages and savages to become devils.  It is not a mistake merely, but a great
misfortune, that our laws touching so delicate and vital a question as the ownership and transfer
of mineral lands were not so framed as to avert these frightful evils.  As far as the past
is concerned they are without remedy, and there is no positive safeguard for the future but
in a return to the time-honored principles which give to the owner of the surface all that
may be found within his lines, extended downward vertically, and refer all disputes to the
old-fashioned and familiar machinery of the General Land Office. This system gave order and
peace to the great lead and copper regions of the Northwest, and it would bring with it the
same inestimable blessings to the harassed and sorely tried regions of the Pacific slope.

About the same time the action of Congress supplied another example of hasty and slip-shod
legislation, which has been perhaps equally prolific of evil.  The State of California, soon
after her admission, had assumed the right to dispose of the public lands within her borders
according to her own peculiar wishes, and in disregard of the authority of the United States.
This led to such serious conflicts and complications, that a remedy was sought in a bill to
quiet land titles in that State.  It was a very questionable measure, inasmuch as the parties
claiming title under the State could only be relieved by recognizing her illegal acts as valid,
and at the expense of claimants under the laws of the United States.  It necessarily involved
the right of pre-emption, and this was distinctly presented in connection with what was known
as the Suscol Ranch in that State.  It contained about ninety thousand acres, and was covered
by an old Spanish grant which the Supreme Court of the United States in the year 1862 had pronounced
void, soon after which numerous settlers went upon the land as pre-emptors, as they had a right
to do.  Their claims as such, being disputed by parties asserting title under the void grant,
the General Land Office, on the reference of the question to that department, decided in favor
of the pre-emptors, upon which the opposing parties procured the submission of the question
to the Attorney-General.  That officer gave his opinion to the effect that a settler under
the pre-emption laws acquires no vested interest in the land he occupies by virtue of his settlement,
and can acquire no such interest, till he has taken all the legal steps necessary to perfect
an entrance in the Land Office, being, in the meantime, a mere tenant-at-will, who may be ejected
by the Government at any moment in favor of another party.  In pursuance of this opinion scores
of bona fide settlers were driven from their pre-emptions, which the laws of the United States
had offered them, on certain prescribed conditions, with which they were willing and anxious
to comply, and their homes, with the valuable improvements made upon them in good faith, were
handed over to speculators and monopolists.  The proceeding was as outrageous as the ruling
which authorized it was surprising to the whole country; and it naturally awakened uneasiness
and alarm among our pioneer settlers everywhere.  It seemed to me very proper, therefore, that
in a bill to quiet land titles in California, these troubles on this Ranch should be settled
by a fitting amendment, which should protect the rights of these pre-emptors against the effect
of the ruling referred to.  The opinions of the Attorney- General had completely overturned
the whole policy of the Government as popularly understood, and I simply proposed to restore
it by a proviso guarding the rights of bona fide settlers who were claiming title under the
laws of the United States; but to my perfect amazement I found the California delegation bitterly
opposed to this amendment.  The reading of it threw them into a spasm of rage, and showed that
they were less anxious to quiet titles in their State than to serve the monopolies and rings
which had trampled on the laws of the United States, and thus involved themselves in trouble.
The zeal and industry of the delegation in this opposition could only be paralleled by their
labors for the passage of their mineral land bill; and the same appeals were made in both cases.
They said this was a "local measure," and that they understood the interests of the Pacific
coast better than men from the old States, while they begged and button-holed members with
a pertinacity very rarely witnessed in any legislative body.  They turned the business of log-rolling
to such account that the amendment was defeated by a strong majority, while it proved the entering
wedge to other and greater outrages upon the rights of settlers which the country has since
witnessed, and was followed by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, fully
affirming the principle laid down in the opinion of the Attorney General.  This ruling, which
has been aptly styled "the Dred Scott decision of the American Pioneer," has been repeatedly
re-affirmed, while the claim of pre-emption, once universally regarded as a substantial right,
has faded away into a glamour or myth.

The fall elections of this year were complicated by the hostile influence of the Executive,
but the popular current was strongly on the side of Congress.  A few prominent Republican members
followed the President, but the great body of them stood firm.  In my own Congressional district
my majority was over 6,200, notwithstanding the formidable conservative opposition in my own
party, and its extraordinary efforts to divide the Republicans through the patronage of the
Administration.  Nearly all of my old opponents in the district and State were now Johnsonized,
except Gov. Morton, whose temporary desertion the year before was atoned for by a prudent and
timely repentance.  He was not, however, thoroughly reconstructed; for in the Philadelphia
Loyal Convention which met in September of this year to consider the critical state of the
country, he used his influence with the delegates from the South to prevent their espousal
of Negro Suffrage, and begged Theodore Tilton to prevail on Frederick Douglass to take the
first train of cars for home, in order to save the Republican party from detriment.  He was
still under the shadow of his early Democratic training; and he and his satellites, vividly
remembering my campaign for Negro Suffrage the year before, and finding me thoroughly intrenched
in my Congressional district, hit upon a new project for my political discomfiture. This was
the re-districting of the State at the ensuing session of the Indiana Legislature, which they
succeeded in accomplishing by disguising their real purpose.  There was neither reason nor
excuse for such a scheme at this time, apart from my political fortunes; and by the most shameless
Gerrymandering three counties of my district, which gave me a majority of 5,000, were taken
from me, and four others added in which I was personally but little acquainted, and which gave
an aggregate Democratic majority of about 1,500. This was preliminary to the next Congressional
race, and the success of the enterprise remained to be tested; but it furnished a curious illustration
of the state of Indiana Republicanism at that time.

On the meeting of Congress in December the signs of political progress since the adjournment
were quite noticeable.  The subject of impeachment began to be talked about, and both houses
seemed ready for all necessary measures.  Since mingling freely with their constituents, very
few Republican members insisted that the XIV Constitutional Amendment should be accepted as
a finality, or as an adequate solution of the problem of reconstruction.  The second section
of that amendment, proposing to abandon the colored race in the South on condition that they
should not be counted in the basis of representation, was now generally condemned, and if the
question had been a new one it could not have been adopted.  This enlightenment of Northern
representatives was largely due to the prompt and contemptuous rejection by the rebellious
States of the XIV Amendment as a scheme of reconstruction, and their enactment of black codes
which made the condition of the freedmen more deplorable than slavery itself.  In this instance,
as in that of Mr. Lincoln's Proclamation of Emancipation, it was rebel desperation which saved
the negro; for if the XIV Amendment had been at first accepted, the work of reconstruction
would have ended without conferring upon him the ballot.  This will scarcely be denied by any
one, and has been frankly admitted by some of the most distinguished leaders of the party.

The policy of treating these States as Territories seemed now to be rapidly gaining ground,
and commended itself as the only logical way out of the political dilemma in which the Government
was placed. But here again the old strife between radicalism and conservatism cropped out.
The former opposed all haste in the work of reconstruction.  It insisted that what the rebellious
districts needed was not an easy and speedy return to the places they had lost by their treasonable
conspiracy, but a probationary training, looking to their restoration when they should prove
their fitness for civil government as independent States.  It was insisted that they were not
prepared for this, and that with their large population of ignorant negroes and equally ignorant
whites, dominated by a formidable oligarchy of educated land-owners who despised the power
that had conquered them, while they still had the sympathy of their old allies in the North,
the withdrawal of Federal intervention and the unhindered operation of local supremacy would
as fatally hedge up the way of justice and equality as the rebel despotisms then existing.
The political and social forces of Southern society, if unchecked from without, were sure to
assert themselves, and the more decided anti-slavery men in both houses of Congress so warned
the country, and foretold that no theories of Democracy could avail unless adequately supported
by a healthy and intelligent public opinion.  They saw that States must grow, and could not
be suddenly constructed where the materials were wanting, and that forms are worthless in the
hands of an ignorant mob.  It was objected to the territorial theory that it was arbitrary,
and would lead to corruption and tyranny like the pro-consular system of Rome; but it was simply
the territorial system to which we had been accustomed from the beginning of the Government,
and could not prove worse than the hasty re-admission of ten conquered districts to the dignity
of States of the Union, involving, as it has done, the horrors of carpet-bag government, Ku
Klux outrages, and a system of pro-consular tyranny as inconsistent with the rights of these
States as it has been disgraceful to the very idea of free government and fatal to the best
interests of the colored race.

But the strange chaos of opinion which now prevailed was unfavorable to sound thinking or wise
acting.  Great and far-reaching interests were at stake, but they were made the sport of politicians,
and disposed of in the light of their supposed effect upon the ascendancy of the Republican
party.  Statesmanship was sacrificed to party management, and the final result was that the
various territorial bills which had been introduced in both Houses, and the somewhat incongruous
bills of Stevens and Ashley, were all superseded by the passage of the "Military bill," which
was vetoed by the President, but re-enacted in the face of his objections.  This bill was utterly
indefensible on principle.  It was completely at war with the genius and spirit of democratic
government.  Instead of furnishing the Rebel districts with civil governments, and providing
for a military force adequate to sustain them, it abolished civil government entirely, and
installed the army in its place.  It was a confession of Congressional incompetence to deal
with a problem which Congress alone had the right to solve.  Its provisions perfectly exposed
it to all the objections which could be urged to the plan of territorial reconstruction, while
they inaugurated a centralized military despotism in the place of that system of well-understood
local self- government which the territorial policy offered as a preparation for restoration.
The measure was analyzed and exposed with great ability by Henry J. Raymond, whose arguments
were unanswered and unanswerable; but nothing could stay the prevailing impatience of Congress
for speedy legislation looking to the early return of the rebel districts to their places in
the Union.  The bill was a legislative solecism.  It did not abrogate the existing Rebel State
governments.  It left the ballot in the hands of white Rebels, and did not confer it upon the
black loyalists.  It sought to conciliate the power it was endeavoring to coerce.  It provided
for negro suffrage as one of the fundamental conditions on which the rebellious States should
be restored to their places in the Union, but left the negro to the mercy of their black codes,
pending the decision of the question of their acceptance of the proposed conditions of restoration.
The freedmen were completely in the power of their old masters, so long as the latter might
refuse the terms of reconstruction that were offered; and they had the option to refuse them
entirely, if they saw fit to prefer their own mad ascendancy and its train of disorders to
compulsory restoration.  This perfectly inexcusable abandonment of negro suffrage was zealously
defended by a small body of conservative Republicans who were still lingering in the sunshine
of executive favor, and of whom Mr. Blaine was the chief; and it was through the timely action
of Mr. Shellabarger, of Ohio, which these conservatives opposed, that the scheme of reconstruction
was finally so amended as to make the Rebel State governments provisional only, and secure
the ballot to the negro during the period, whether long or short, which might intervene prior
to the work of re-admission.  This provision was absolutely vital, because it took from the
people of the insurrectionary districts every motive for refusing the acceptance of the terms
proposed, and settled the work of reconstruction by this exercise of absolute power by their
conquerors.  It was this provision which secured the support of the Radical Republicans in
Congress; but it did not meet their objections to this scheme of hasty military reconstruction,
while these objections have been amply justified by time.

Thaddeus Stevens never appeared to such splendid advantage as a parliamentary leader as in
this protracted debate on reconstruction. He was then nearly seventy-six, and was physically
so feeble that he could scarcely stand; but his intellectual resources seemed to be perfectly
unimpaired.  Eloquence, irony, wit, and invective, wre charmingly blended in the defense of
his positions and his attacks upon his opponents.  In dealing with the views of Bingham, Blaine,
and Banks, he was by no means complimentary.  He referred to them in his closing speech on
the bill, on the thirteenth of February, when he said, in response to an interruption by Mr.
Blaine, "What I am speaking of is this proposed step toward universal amnesty and universal
Andy-Johnsonism.  If this Congress so decides, it will give me great pleasure to join in the
io triumphe of the gentleman from Ohio in leading this House, possibly by forbidden paths,
into the sheep-fold or the goat-fold of the President."  In speaking of the amendment to the
bill offered by General Banks, he said, "It proposes to set up a contrivance at the mouth of
the Mississippi, and by hydraulic action to control all the States that are washed by the waters
of that great stream."  He declared that, "The amendment of the gentleman from Maine lets in
a vast number of Rebels, and shuts out nobody.  All I ask is that when the House comes to vote
upon that amendment, it shall understand that the adoption of it would be an entire surrender
of those States into the hands of the Rebels.

As a precautionary measure against executive usurpation, the Fortieth Congress was organized
in March, 1867, immediately after the adjournment of the Thirty-ninth.  After a brief session
it adjourned till the third of July to await the further progress of events. On re-assembling
I found the feeling in favor of impeachment had considerably increased, but was not yet strong
enough to prevail. All that could be done was the passage of a supplemental act on the subject
of reconstruction, which naturally provoked another veto, in which the President re-affirmed
the points of his message vetoing the original bill, and arraigned the action of Congress as
high-handed and despotic.  The message was construed by the Republicans as an open defiance,
and many of them felt that a great duty had been slighted in failing to impeach him months
before. The feeling against him became perfectly relentless, as I distinctly remember it, and
shared in it myself; but on referring to the message now, I am astonished at the comparative
moderation of its tone, and the strength of its positions.  Its logic, in the main, is impregnable,
if it be granted that the Rebel districts were not only States, but States in the Union, and
the Congress which was now so enraged at the President had itself refused to deal with them
as Territories or outlying possessions, and thereby invited the aggravating thrusts of the
message at the consistency of his assailants.

Just before the adjournment of this brief session of Congress, an amusing incident occurred
in connection with the introduction of the following resolution in the House:

"Resolved, That the doctrines avowed by the President of the United States, in his message
to Congress of the fifteenth instant, to the effect that the abrogation of the governments
of the Rebel States binds the Nation to pay the debts incurred prior to the late Rebellion,
is at war with the principles of international law, a deliberate stab at the national credit,
abhorrent to every sentiment of loyalty, and well-pleasing only to the vanquished traitors
by whose agency alone the governments of said States were overthrown and destroyed."

The resolution was adopted by yeas one hundred, nays eighteen, and the announcement of the
vote provoked the laughter of both sides of the House.  It gratified the Republicans, because
it was a thrust at Andrew Johnson, and perfectly accorded with their prevailing political mood,
which was constantly becoming more embittered toward him.  It equally gratified the Democrats,
because they at once accepted it as a telling shot at Gov. Morton, who had fathered the condemned
heresy nearly two years before in his famous Richmond speech, which he and his friends had
been doing their best to forget.  Party feeling had never before been more intense; but this
resolution performed its mediatorial office with such magical effect in playing with two utterly
diverse party animosities, that Republicans and Democrats were alike surprised to find themselves
suddenly standing on common ground, and joyfully shaking hands in token of this remarkable
display of their good fellowship.

Congress assembled again on the twenty-first of November, in consequence of the extraordinary
conduct of the President.  The popular feeling in favor of impeachment had now become formidable,
and on the twenty-fifth the Judiciary Committee of the House finally reported in favor of the
measure.  The galleries were packed, and the scene was one of great interest, while all the
indications seemed to point to success; but on the seventh of December, the proposition was
voted down by yeas fifty-seven, nays one hundred and eight.  The vote was a great surprise
and disappointment to the friends of impeachment, and was construed by them as a wanton surrender
by Congress, and the prelude to new acts of executive lawlessness.  These acts continued to
be multiplied, and the removal of Secretary Stanton finally so prepared the way that on the
twenty- fourth of February, 1868, the House, by a vote of one hundred and twenty-six to forty-seven,
declared in favor of impeachment.  The crowds in the galleries, in the lobbies, and on the
floor were unprecedented, and the excitement at high tide.  The fifty-seven who had voted for
impeachment in December, were now happy.  They felt, at last, that the country was safe.  The
whole land seemed to be electrified, as they believed it would have been at any previous time
if the House had had the nerve to go forward; and they rejoiced that the madness of Johnson
had at last compelled Congress to face the great duty.  A committee of seven was appointed
by the Speaker to prepare articles of impeachment, of whom Thaddeus Stevens was chairman. 
He was now rapidly failling in strength, and every morning had to be carried up stairs to his
seat in the House; but his humor never failed him, and on one of these occasions he said to
the young men who had him in charge, "I wonder, boys, who will carry me when you are dead and
gone."  He was very thin, pale and haggard.  His eye was bright, but his face was "scarred
by the crooked autograph of pain."  He was a constant sufferer, and during the session of the
Committee kept himself stimulated by sipping a little wine or brandy; but he was its ruling
spirit, and greatly speeded its work by the clearness of his perceptions and the strength of
his will.  His mental force seemed to defy the power of disease. The articles of impeachment
were ready for submission in a few days, and adopted by the House, on the second of March,
by a majority of considerably more than two thirds, when the case was transferred to the Senate.

The popular feeling against the President was now rapidly nearing its climax and becoming a
sort of frenzy.  Andrew Johnson was no longer merely a "wrong-headed and obstinate man," but
a "genius in depravity," whose hoarded malignity and passion were unfathomable. He was not
simply "an irresolute mule," as General Schenck had styled him, but was devil-bent upon the
ruin of his country; and his trial connected itself with all the memories of the war, and involved
the Nation in a new and final struggle for its life.

This fearful discharge of rhetorical fireworks at the President fitly voiced the general sentiment
of the Republicans.  Party madness was in the air, and quite naturally gave birth to the "hole
in the sky" in the agony of its effort to find expression.  No extravagance of speech or explosion
of wrath was deemed out of order during this strange dispensation in our politics.

The trial proceeded with unabated interest, and on the afternoon of the eleventh of May the
excitement reached its highest point. Reports came from the Senate, then in secret session,
that Grimes, Fessenden and Henderson were certainly for acquittal, and that other senators
were to follow them.  An indescribable gloom now prevailed among the friends of impeachment,
which increased during the afternoon, and at night when the Senate was again in session. At
the adjournment there was some hope of conviction, but it was generally considered very doubtful.
On meeting my old anti-slavery friend, Dr. Brisbane, he told me he felt as if he were sitting
up with a sick friend who was expected to die.  His face was the picture of despair.  To such
men it seemed that all the trials of the war were merged in this grand issue, and that it involved
the existence of Free Government on this continent.  The final vote was postponed till the
sixteenth, owing to Senator Howard's illness, and on the morning of that day the friends of
impeachment felt more confident.  The vote was first taken on the eleventh article.  The galleries
were packed, and an indescribable anxiety was written on every face.  Some of the members of
the House near me grew pale and sick under the burden of suspense.  Such stillness prevailed
that the breathing in the galleries could be heard at the announcement of each senator's vote.
This was quite noticeable when any of the doubtful senators voted, the people holding their
breath as the words "guilty" or "not guilty" were pronounced, and then giving it simultaneous
vent. The senator, in evident excitement, inadvertently answered "guilty," and thus lent a
momentary relief to the friends of impeachment; but this was immediately dissipated by correcting
his vote on the statement of the Chief Justice that he did not understand the senator's response
to the question.  Nearly all hope of conviction fled when Senator Ross, of Kansas, voted "not
guilty," and a long breathing of disappointment and despair followed the like vote of Van Winkle,
which settled the case in favor of the President.

It is impossible now to realize how perfectly overmastering was the excitement of these days.
The exercise of calm judgment was simply out of the question.  As I have already stated, passion
ruled the hour, and constantly strengthened the tendency to one- sidedness and exaggeration.
The attempt to impeach the President was undoubtedly inspired, mainly, by patriotic motives;
but the spirit of intolerance among Republicans toward those who differed with them in opinion
set all moderation and common sense at defiance. Patriotism and party animosity were so inextricably
mingled and confounded that the real merits of the controversy could only be seen after the
heat and turmoil of the strife had passed away. Time has made this manifest.  Andrew Johnson
was not the Devil- incarnate he was then painted, nor did he monopolize, entirely, the "wrong-headedness"
of the times.  No one will now dispute that the popular estimate of his character did him very
great injustice. It is equally certain that great injustice was done to Trumbull, Fessenden,
Grimes and other senators who voted to acquit the President, and gave proof of their honesty
and independence by facing the wrath and scorn of the party with which they had so long been
identified.  The idea of making the question of impeachment a matter of party discipline was
utterly indefensible and preposterous. "Those senators," as Horace Greeley declared, "were
sublimely in the right who maintained their independent judgment--whether it was correct or
erroneous, in a matter of this kind, and who indignantly refused all attempts to swerve them
from their duty as they had undertaken to perform it by solemn oaths."  The Chief Justice was
also cruelly and inexcusably wronged by imputing corrupt motives to his official action.  His
integrity and courage had been amply demonstrated through many long years of thorough and severe
trial; and yet many of his Republican friends, both in the Senate and House, who had known
him throughout his political career, denounced him as an apostate and a traitor, and even denied
him all social recognition.  Senator Howe, of Wisconsin, was especially abusive, and made himself
perfectly ridiculous by the extravagance and malignity of his assaults.  The judicial spirit
was everywhere wanting, and the elevation of Senator Wade to the Presidency in the midst of
so much passion and tumult, and with the peculiar political surroundings which the event foreshadowed,
would have been, to say the least, a very questionable experiment for the country.

The excitement attending the trial of the President soon subsided, but the Republicans continued
anxious about the state of the country. The work of reconstruction was only fairly begun, and
its completion was involved in the approaching presidential election.  Chase and Seward had
lost their standing in the party, and there was no longer any civilian in its ranks whose popularity
was especially commanding or at all over-shadowing.  Under these circumstances it was quite
natural to turn to the army, and to canvass the claims of Gen. Grant.  The idea of his nomination
was exceedingly distasteful to me.  I personally knew him to be intemperate.  In politics he
was a Democrat.  He did not profess to be a Republican, and the only vote he had ever given
was cast for James Buchanan in 1856, when the Republican party made its first grand struggle
to rescue the Government from the clutches of slavery.  Moreover, he had had no training whatever
in civil administration, and no one thought of him as a statesman.  But the plea of his availability
as a military chieftain was urged with great effect, and was made irresistible by the apprehension
that if not nominated by the Republicans the Democrats would appropriate him, and make him
a formidable instrument of mischief.  His nomination, however, was only secured by cautious
and timely diplomacy, and potent appeals to his sordidness, in the shape of assurances that
he should have the office for a second term.  But as the nominee of his party, fairly committed
to its principles and measures touching the unsettled questions of reconstruction and suffrage,
I saw no other practicable alternative than to give him my support.  I was still further reconciled
to this by the action of the Democrats in the nomination of Seymour and Blair, and the avowal
of the latter in his famous "Brodhead letter," that "we must have a President who will execute
the will of the people by trampling in the dust the usurpations of Congress known as the Reconstruction
Acts."

In my new Congressional district I was unanimously re-nominated by the Republicans, and entered
at once upon the canvass, though scarcely well enough to leave my bed.  The issue was doubtful,
and my old-time enemies put forth their whole power against me at the election.  They were
determined, this time, to win, and to make sure of this they embarked in a desperate and shameless
scheme of ballot-stuffing in the city of Richmond, which was afterward fully exposed; but in
spite of this enterprise of "Ku Klux Republicans," I was elected by a small majority.  The
result, however, foreshadowed the close of my congressional labors, which followed two years
later, just as the XV Constitutional Amendment had made voters of the colored men of the State;
but it was only made possible by my failing health, which had unfitted me for active leadership.
In my old district I had made myself absolutely invincible.  For twenty- one years in succession,
that is to say, from the year 1848 to the year 1868, both inclusive, I canvassed that district
by townships and neighborhoods annually on the stump.  In the beginning, public opinion was
overwhelmingly and fiercely against me, but I resolved, at whatever cost, to reconstruct it
in conformity with my own earnest convictions.  I literally wore myself out in the work, and
am perfectly amazed when I recall the amount of it I performed, and the complete abandon of
myself to the task.  From the beginning to the end of this struggle the politicians of the
district were against me, and they were numerous and formidable, and in every contest were
reinforced by the politicians of the State.  Although the ranks of my supporters were constantly
recruited and no man ever had more devoted friends, I was obliged, during all these years,
to stand alone as the champion of my cause in debate.  I believe no Congressional district
in the Union was ever the theatre of so much hard toil by a single man; but although it involved
the serious abridgement of health and life, the ruinous neglect of my private affairs, and
the sacrifice of many precious friendships, I was not without my reward.  I succeeded in my
work.  Step by step I saw my constituents march up to my position, and the district at last
completely disenthralled by the ceaseless and faithful administration of anti-slavery truth.
The tables were completely turned.  Almost everybody was an Abolitionist, and nobody any longer
made a business of swearing that he was not.  In canvassing my district it became the regular
order of business for a caravan of candidates for minor offices, who were sportively called
the "side show," to follow me from point to point, all vying with each other as to which had
served longest and most faithfully as my friends. They had always been opposed to slavery,
and men who had taken the lead in mobbing Abolitionists in earlier days and gained a livelihood
by slave-catching, were now active and zealous leaders in the Republican party.  It was a marvelous
change.  Slavery itself, greatly to the surprise and delight of its enemies, had perished;
but it was, after all, only one form of a world-wide evil.  The abolition of the chattel slavery
of the Southern negro was simply the introduction and prelude to the emancipation of all races
from all forms of servitude, and my Congressional record had been a practical illustration
of my faith in this truth.  The rights of man are sacred, whether trampled down by Southern
slave-drivers, the monopolists of the soil, the grinding power of corporate wealth, the legalized
robbery of a protective tariff, or the power of concentrated capital in alliance with labor-saving
machinery.

During the winter preceding the inauguration of the President I was besieged by place-hunters
more than ever before.  They thronged about me constantly, while I generally wrote from twenty
to thirty letters per day in response to inquiries about appointments from my district.  The
squabbles over post-office appointments were by far the most vexatious and unmanageable.  They
were singularly fierce, and I found it wholly impossible to avoid making enemies of men who
had supported me with zeal.  I was tormented for months about the post-office of a single small
town in Franklin county, where the rival parties pounced upon each other like cannibals, and
divided the whole community into two hostile camps.  I was obliged to give my days and nights
to this wretched business, and often received only curses for the sincerest endeavors to do
what I believed was right.  The experience became absolutely sickening, and could not be otherwise
than seriously damaging to me politically. Such matters were wholly foreign to the business
of legislation, and I wrote a very earnest letter to Mr. Jenckes, of Rhode Island, heartily
commending his measure proposed in the preceding Congress for the reform of our Civil Service,
and for which, as the real pioneer of this movement, he deserves a monument.  This was prior
to the ratification of the XV Amendment, and I so numbered the proposition; but on further
reflection I preferred an amendment in the exact form of the fifteenth, and early in the next
Congress I submitted it, being the first proposition offered for a sixteenth amendment to the
Constitution.  My opinions about woman suffrage, however, date much farther back.  The subject
was first brought to my attention in a brief chapter on the "political non-existence of woman,"
in Miss Martineau's book on "Society in America," which I read in 1847. She there pithily states
the substance of all that has since been said respecting the logic of woman's right to the
ballot, and finding myself unable to answer it, I accepted it.  On recently referring to this
chapter I find myself more impressed by its force than when I first read it.  "The most principled
Democratic writers on Government," she said, "have on this subject sunk into fallacies as disgraceful
as any advocate of despotism has adduced.  In fact, they have thus sunk, from being, for the
moment, advocates of despotism.  Jefferson in America, and James Mill at home, subside, for
the occasion, to the level of the Emperor of Russia's catechism for the young Poles."  This
she makes unanswerably clear; but my interest in the slavery question was awakened about the
same time. I regarded it as the previous question, and as less abstract and far more immediately
important and absorbing than that of suffrage for woman.  For the sake of the negro I accepted
Mr. Lincoln's philosophy of "one war at a time," though always ready to show my hand; but when
this was fairly out of the way, I was prepared to enlist actively in the next grand movement
in behalf of the sacredness and equality of human rights.

The inaugural speech of Gen. Grant was a feeble performance, and very unsatisfactory to his
friends.  When he announced his Cabinet, disappointment was universal among Republicans, and
was greatly increased when he asked Congress to relieve A. T. Stewart, his nominee for Secretary
of the Treasury, from the disability wisely imposed by the Act of Congress of 1789, forbidding
the appointment to that position of any one engaged "in carrying on the business of trade or
commerce."  Senator Sherman at once introduced a bill to repeal this enactment, but Mr. Sumner
vigorously opposed the measure, and the President soon afterward sent a message to the Senate
asking leave to withdraw his request as to Mr. Stewart.  It was doubtless the prompt and decided
stand taken by Mr. Sumner in this matter which laid the foundation for the President's personal
hostility to him, which so remarkably developed itself during the following years.  The seeds
of a party feud were thus planted, and as the Administration continued to show its hand, bore
witness to a vigorous growth.

In June of this year I made a trip to California in search of health, which I had lost through
overwork, and was now paying the penalty in a very distressing form of insomnia.  I took one
of the first through trains to the Pacific, and on reaching the State, I found sight-seeing
and travel so irresistible a temptation, that I lost the rest and quiet I so absolutely needed.
I was constantly on the wing; and I encountered at every point, the "settler," who was anxious
to talk over the land squabbles of the State, with which I had had much to do in Congress,
but now needed for a season to forget.  I found that the half had not been told me respecting
the ravages of land-grabbing under the Swamp Land Act of 1850, and the mal-administration of
Mexican and Spanish grants.  I was full of the subject, and was obliged, also, to give particular
attention to the pre-emption of J. M. Hutchings, in the Yosemite Valley, for the protection
of which I had reported a bill which was then pending; and I came near losing my life in the
valley through the fatigue I suffered in reaching it.  After a stay of over two months in California,
and a trip by steamer to Oregon and Washington Territory, I returned home early in September,
but in no better health than when I left; and a like experience attended a journey to Minnesota
soon afterward, where I was captured by leading railroad men who belabored me over the land-grant
to the St. Croix and Bayfield railroad, the revival of which I had aided in defeating at the
previous session of Congress.

I returned to Washington in December, but physically unfit for labor, spending most of the
session in New York under the care of a physician.  I deeply regretted this, for the railway
lobby was in Washington in full force, as it was during the closing session of the Forty-first
Congress, when I was equally unfit for business. I was not, however, without consolation. 
Under the popular reaction against the Land-grant system which I had done my part to create,
the huge pile of land bills on the Speaker's table failed, save the Texas Pacific project,
which was carried by the most questionable methods, and against such a general protest as clearly
indicated the end of this policy.  A vote of nearly two to one was carried in the House in
favor of a bill reported by the Land Committee defining swamp and overflowed lands, and guarding
against the enormous swindles that had disgraced the Land Department and afflicted honest settlers.
A like vote was secured in favor of the bill to prevent the further disposition of the public
lands save under the pre-emption and homestead laws, for which I had labored for years.  Many
thousands of acres had been saved from the clutches of monopolists by attaching to several
important grants the condition that the lands should be sold only to actual settlers, in quantities
not exceeding a quarter section, and for not more than two dollars and fifty cents per acre.
A very important reform, already referred to, had been made in our Indian treaty policy, by
which lands relinquished by any tribe would henceforth fall under the operation of our land
laws, instead of being sold in a body to some corporation or individual monopolist.  The Southern
Homestead law had dedicated to actual settlement millions of acres of the public domain in
the land States of the South, while the Homestead Act of 1862 was splendidly vindicating the
wisdom of its policy. Congress had declared forfeited and open to settlement a large grant
of lands in Louisiana for non-compliance with the conditions on which it was made, and the
public domain had been saved from frightful spoilation by the fortunate defeat of a scheme
of land bounties that would completely have overturned the policy of the pre-emption and homestead
laws, while practically mocking the claims of the soldiers.  The opportunity, now and then,
to strangle a legislative monster like this, or to further the passage of beneficent and far-reaching
measures, is one of the real compensations of public life.

The final ratification of the Fifteenth Constitutional Amendment, which was declared in force
on the thirtieth of March, 1870, perfectly consummated the mission of the Republican party,
and left its members untrammeled in dealing with new questions.  In fact, the Republican movement
in the beginning was a political combination, rather than a party.  Its action was inspired
less by a creed than an object, and that object was to dedicate our National Territories to
freedom, and denationalize slavery.  Aside from this object, the members of the combination
were hopelessly divided.  The organization was created to deal with this single question, and
would not have existed without it.  It was now regarded by many as a spent political force,
although it had received a momentum which threatened to outlast its mission; and if it did
not keep the promise made in its platform of 1868, to reform the corruptions of the preceding
Administration, and at the same time manfully wrestle with the new problems of the time, it
was morally certain to degenerate into a faction, led by base men, and held together by artful
appeals to the memories of the past.  Our tariff legislation called for a thorough revision.
Our Civil Service was becoming a system of political prostitution.  Roguery and plunder, born
of the multiplied temptations which the war furnished, had stealthily crept into the management
of public affairs, and claimed immunity from the right of search.  What the country needed
was not a stricter enforcement of party discipline, not military methods and the fostering
of sectional hate, but oblivion of the past, and an earnest, intelligent, and catholic endeavor
to grapple with the questions of practical administration.

But this, in the very nature of the case, was not to be expected. The men who agreed to stand
together in 1856, on a question which was now out of the way, and had postponed their differences
on current party questions for that purpose, were comparatively unfitted for the task of civil
administration in a time of peace.  They had had no preparatory training, and the engrossing
struggle through which they had passed had, in fact, disqualified them for the work. While
the issues of the war were retreating into the past the mercenary element of Republicanism
had gradually secured the ascendancy, and completely appropriated the President.  The mischiefs
of war had crept into the conduct of civil affairs, and a thorough schooling of the party in
the use of power had familiarized it with military ideas and habits, and committed it to loose
and indefensible opinions respecting the powers of the General Government.  The management
of the Civil Service was an utter mockery of political decency, while the animosities engendered
by the war were nursed and coddled as the appointed means of uniting the party and covering
up its misdeeds.  The demand for reform, as often as made, was instantly rebuked, and the men
who uttered it branded as enemies of the party and sympathizers with treason.  It is needless
to go into details; but such was the drift of general demoralization that the chief founders
and pre-eminent representatives of the party, Chase, Seward, Sumner and Greeley were obliged
to desert it more than a year before the end of Gen. Grant's first administration, as the only
means of maintaining their honor and self-respect.  My Congressional term expired a little
after Grant and Babcock had inaugurated the San Domingo project, and Sumner had been degraded
from the Chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to make room for Simon Cameron. 
The "irrepressible conflict" had just begun to develop itself between the element of honesty
and reform in the party, and the corrupt leadership which sought to make merchandise of its
good name, and hide its sins under the mantle of its past achievements.

After the adjournment of the Forty-first Congress in March, 1871, I visited New York, where
I called on Greeley.  We took a drive together, and spent the evening at the house of a mutual
friend, where we had a free political talk.  He denounced the Administration and the San Domingo
project in a style which commanded my decided approval, for my original dislike of Grant had
been ripening into disgust and contempt, and, like Greeley, I had fully made up my mind that
under no circumstance could I ever again give him my support.  After my return home I wrote
several articles for the Press in favor of a "new departure" in the principles of the party.
Mr. Vallandigham had just given currency to this phrase by employing it to designate his proposed
policy of Democratic acquiescence in the XIV and XV Constitutional Amendments, which was seconded
by the "Missouri Republican," and accepted by the party the following year.  The "new departure"
I commended to my own party was equally thorough, proposing the radical reform of its Tariff
and Land Policy, and its emancipation from the rule of great corporations and monopolies; a
thorough reform of its Civil Service, beginning with a declaration in favor of the "one-term
principle," and condemning the action of the President in employing the whole power and patronage
of his high office in securing his re-election for a second term by hurling from office honest,
capable and faithful men, simply to make places for scalawags and thieves; and the unqualified
repudiation of his conduct in heaping honors and emoluments upon his poor kin, while accepting
presents of fine houses and other tempting gifts from unworthy men, who were paid off in fat
places.  I did not favor the disbanding of the party, or ask that it should make war on Gen.
Grant, but earnestly protested against the policy that sought to Tammany-ize the organization
through his re-nomination.

Returning to Washington on the meeting of Congress in December, I conferred with Trumbull,
Schurz and Sumner, respecting the situation, and the duty of Republicans in facing the party
crisis which was evidently approaching.  During the session, I listened to the great debate
in the Senate on Sumner's resolution of inquiry as to the sale of arms to the French, and was
delighted with the replies of Schurz and Sumner to Conkling and Morton.  My dislike of the
President steadily increased, and his disgraceful conduct towards Sumner and alliance with
Morton, Conkling, Cameron, and their associates rendered it morally impossible for me any longer
to fight under his banner.  The situation became painfully embarrassing, since every indication
seemed to point to his re-nomination as a foregone conclusion.  But I clung to the hope that
events would in some way order it otherwise.  In February, I was strongly urged to become a
candidate for Congressman at large under the new Congressional apportionment; and although
failing health unfitted me for active politics, to which I had no wish to return, I really
wanted the compliment of the nomination.  The long-continued and wanton opposition which had
been waged against me in my own party led me to covet it, and in the hope that General Grant's
nomination might yet be averted I allowed my friends to urge my claims, and to believe I would
accept the honor if tendered, which I meant to do should this hope be realized.  I saw that
I could secure it.  My standing in my own party was better than ever before.  The "Indianapolis
Journal," for the first time, espoused my cause, along with other leading Republican papers
in different sections of the State.  The impolicy and injustice of the warfare which had long
been carried on against me in Indiana were so generally felt by all fair-minded Republicans
that Senator Morton himself, though personally quite as hostile as ever, was constrained to
call off his forces, and favor a policy of conciliation.  It was evident that my nomination
was assured if I remained in the field; but as time wore on I saw that the re-nomination of
General Grant had become absolutely inevitable; and, as I could not support him I could not
honorably accept a position which would commit me in his favor.  The convention was held on
the 22d of February, and on the day before I sent a telegram peremptorily refusing to stand
as a candidate; and I soon afterward formally committed myself to the Liberal Republican movement.
I could not aid in the re-election of Grant without sinning against decency and my own self-respect.
I deplored the fact, but there was no other alternative.  If it had been morally possible,
I would have supported him gladly.  I had no personal grievances to complain of, and most sincerely
regretted the necessity which compelled my withdrawal from political associations in which
I had labored many long years, and through seasons of great national danger.  If I had consulted
my own selfish ambition I would have chosen a different course, since I knew by painful experience
the cost of party desertion, while the fact was well known that the prizes of politics were
within my reach, if I had sought them through the machinery of the Republican organization
and the support of General Grant.  Had the party, having accomplished the work which called
it into being, applied itself to the living questions of the times, and resolutely set its
face against political corruption and plunder, and had it freely tolerated honest differences
of opinion in its own ranks, treating the question of Grant's re- nomination as an open one,
instead of making it a test of Republicanism and a cause for political excommunication, I could
have avoided a separation, at least at that time.  I made it with many keen pangs of regret,
for the history of the party had been honorable and glorious, and I had shared in its achievements.
My revolt against its discipline forcibly reminded me of the year 1848, and was by far the
severest political trial of my life.  My new position not only placed me in very strange relations
to the Democrats, whose misdeeds I had so earnestly denounced for years; but I could not fail
to see that the great body of my old friends would now become my unrelenting foes.  Their party
intolerance would know no bounds, and I was not unmindful of its power; but there was no way
of escape, and with a sad heart, but an unflinching purpose, I resolved to face the consequences
of my decision.  My chief regret was that impaired health deprived me of the strength and endurance
I would now sorely need in repelling wanton and very provoking assaults.

I attended the Liberal Republican Convention at Cincinnati on the first of May, where I was
delighted to meet troops of the old Free Soilers of 1848 and 1852.  It was a mass convention
of Republicans, suddenly called together without the power of money or the help of party machinery,
and prompted by a burning desire to rebuke the scandals of Gen. Grant's administration, and
rescue both the party and the country from political corruption and misrule.  It was a spontaneous
and independent movement, and its success necessarily depended upon the wisdom of its action
and not the force of party obligation.  There were doubtless political schemers and mercenaries
in attendance, but the rank and file were unquestionably conscientious and patriotic, and profoundly
in earnest.  I never saw a finer looking body assembled.  It was a more formidable popular
demonstration than the famous Convention at Buffalo, in 1848, and gave promise of more immediate
and decisive results.  There was a very widespread feeling that the Cincinnati ticket would
win, and the friends of Gen. Grant could not disguise their apprehension.  The thought seemed
to inspire every one that a way was now fortunately opened for hastening the end of sectional
strife and purifying the administration of public affairs.  The capital speech of Stanley Matthews,
on accepting the temporary chairmanship of the Convention, was but the echo of the feeling
of the Convention, and its confident prophecy of victory.  "Parties," said he, "can not live
on their reputations.  It was remarked, I believe, by Sir Walter Raleigh, in reference to the
strife of ancestry, that those who boasted most of their progenitors were like the plant he
had discovered in America, the best part was under ground."  He declared that "the time has
come when it is the voice of an exceedingly large and influential portion of the American people
that they will no longer be dogs to wear the collar of a party."  All that now seemed wanting
was wise leadership, and a fair expression of the real wish and purpose of the Convention.

The principal candidates were Charles Francis Adams, Horace Greeley, Lyman Trumbull, David
Davis, and B. Gratz Brown.  Mr. Chase still had a lingering form of the Presidential fever,
and his particular friends were lying in wait for a timely opportunity to bring him forward;
but his claims were not seriously considered.  The friends of Judge Davis did him much damage
by furnishing transportation and supplies for large Western delegations, who very noisily pressed
his claims in the Convention.  With prudent leadership his chances for the nomination would
have been good, and he would have been a very formidable candidate; but he was "smothered by
his friends." The really formidable candidates were Adams and Greeley, and during the first
and second days the chances were decidedly in favor of the former.  On the evening of the second
day Mr. Brown and Gen. Blair arrived in the city, pretending that they had come for the purpose
of arranging a trouble in the Missouri delegation; but their real purpose was to throw the
strength of Brown, who was found to have no chance for the first place, in favor of Greeley,
who had said some very flattering words of Brown some time before in a letter published in
a Missouri newspaper.  This new movement further included the nomination of Brown for the second
place on the ticket, and was largely aimed at Carl Schurz, who was an Adams man, and had refused,
though personally very friendly to Brown, to back his claims for the Presidential nomination.
It seemed to be a lucky hit for Greeley, who secured the nomination; but the real cause of
Mr. Adams' defeat, after all, was the folly of Trumbull's friends, who preferred Adams to Greeley,
in holding on to their man in the vain hope of his nomination.  They could have nominated Adams
on the fourth or fifth ballot, if they had given him their votes, as they saw when it was too
late.  Greeley regretted Brown's nomination, and afterward expressed his preference for another
gentleman from the West; and he had, of course, nothing to do with the movement which placed
him on the ticket.

I was woefully disappointed in the work of the Convention, having little faith in the success
of Greeley, and being entirely confident that Adams could be elected if nominated.  I still
think he would have been, and that the work of reform would thus have been thoroughly inaugurated,
and the whole current of American politics radically changed.  The time was ripe for it.  His
defeat was a wet blanket upon many of the leading spirits of the Convention and their followers.
The disappointment of some of these was unspeakably bitter and agonizing.  Stanley Matthews,
illustrating his proverbial instability in politics, and forgetting his brave resolve no longer
"to wear the collar of a party," abruptly deserted to the enemy. The "New York Nation" also
suddenly changed front, giving its feeble support to General Grant, and its malignant hostility
to Greeley. The leading Free Traders in the Convention who had enlisted zealously for Adams
became indifferent or hostile.  Many of the best informed of the Liberal leaders felt that
a magnificent opportunity to launch the work of reform and crown it with success had been madly
thrown away.  With the zealous friends of Mr. Adams it was a season of infinite vexation; but
for me there was no backward step.  The newborn movement had blundered, but Republicanism under
the lead of Grant remained as odious as ever.  It was still the duty of its enemies to oppose
it, and no other method of doing this was left them than through the organization just formed.
That a movement so suddenly extemporized should make mistakes was by no means surprising, while
there was a fairly implied obligation on the part of those who had joined in its organization
to abide by its action, if not wantonly recreant to the principles that had inspired it. The
hearts of the liberal masses were for Greeley, and if he could not be elected, which was by
no means certain, his supporters could at least make their organized protest against the mal-administration
of the party in power.

I attended the Democratic State Convention of Indiana on the twelfth of June, which was one
of the largest and most enthusiastic ever held in the State.  The masses seemed to have completely
broken away from their old moorings, and to be rejoicing in their escape, while their leaders,
many of them reluctantly, accepted the situation. Both were surprisingly friendly to me, and
their purpose was to nominate me as one of the candidates for Congressman-at-large, which they
would have done by acclamation if I had consented.  I was much cheered by such tokens of union
and fraternity in facing the common enemy.  The State campaign was finely opened at Indianapolis
on the eleventh of July, where I presented the issues of the canvass from the Liberal standpoint;
and I continued almost constantly on the stump till the State election in October, having splendid
audiences, and gathering strength and inspiration from the prevailing enthusiasm of the canvass.
The meetings toward the close were real ovations, strikingly reminding me of the campaign of
1856.  Up to the time of the North Carolina election I had strong hopes of victory; but owing
to the alarm which had seized the Grant men on account of Greeley's unexpected popularity,
and the lavish expenditure of their money which followed, the tide was turned, and was never
afterward checked in its course.  They became unspeakably bitter and venomous, and I never
before encountered such torrents of abuse and defamation, outstripping, as it seemed to me,
even the rabidness which confronted the Abolitionists in their early experience.  At one of
my appointments a number of colored men came armed with revolvers, and breathing the spirit
of war which Senator Morton was doing his utmost to kindle.  He had been telling the people
everywhere that Greeley and his followers were all Rebels, seeking to undo the work of the
war, to re-enslave the negro, and saddle upon the country the rebel debt; and these colored
men, heeding his logic, thought that killing Rebels now was as proper a business as during
the war, and would probably have begun their work of murder if they had not been restrained
by the more prudent counsel of their white brethren.  Even in one of the old towns in Eastern
Indiana which had been long known as the headquarters of Abolitionism, a large supply of eggs
was provided for my entertainment when I went there to speak for Greeley; and they were not
thrown at me simply because the fear of a reaction against the party would be the result. 
The Democrats in this canvass were rather handsomely treated; but the fierceness and fury of
the Grant men toward the Liberal Republicans were unrelieved by a single element of honor or
fair play.

This was pre-eminently true in Indiana, and especially so as to myself.  The leaders of Grant,
borrowing the spirit of the campaign, set all the canons of decency at defiance.  "Sore head,"
"Renegade," "Apostate," "Rebel," and "deadbeat," were the compliments constantly lavished.
Garbled extracts from my old war speeches were plentifully scattered over the State, as if
we had been still in the midst of the bloody conflict, and I had suddenly betrayed the country
to its enemies.  Garbled and forged letters were peddled and paraded over the State by windy
political blatherskites, who were hired to propagate the calumnies of their employers.  In
fact, my previous political experience supplied no precedent for this warfare of my former
Republican friends.  But I was not unprepared for it, and fully availed myself of the right
of self-defense and counter attack.  I would not make myself a blackguard, but I met my assailants
in every encounter with the weapons of argument and invective, and stretched them on the rack
of my ridicule; while their prolonged howl bore witness to the effectiveness of my work.  My
whole heart was in it.  The fervor and enthusiasm of earlier years came back to me, and a kindred
courage and faith armed me with the strength which the work of the canvass demanded.

The novelty of the canvass was indeed remarkable in all respects. The Liberal Republicans had
not changed any of their political opinions, nor deserted any principle they had ever espoused,
touching the questions of slavery and the war; and yet they were now in the fiercest antagonism
with the men who had been politically associated with them ever since the organization of the
party, and who had trusted and honored them through all the struggles of the past. They were
branded as "Apostates" from their anti-slavery faith; but slavery had perished forever, and
every man of them would have been found fighting it as before, if it had been practicable to
call it back to life; while many of their assailants had distinguished themselves by mobbing
Abolitionism in the day of its weakness. How could men apostatize from a cause which they had
served with unflinching fidelity until it was completely triumphant?  And how was it possible
to fall from political grace by withdrawing from the fellowship of the knaves and traders that
formed the body-guard of the President, and were using the Republican party as the instrument
of wholesale schemes of jobbery and pelf?  To charge the Liberal Republicans with apostasy
because they had the moral courage to disown and denounce these men was to invent a definition
of the term which would have made all the great apostates of history "honorable men."

They were called "Rebels"; but the war had been over seven years and a half, and if the clock
of our politics could have been set back and the bloody conflict re-instated, every Liberal
would have been shouting, as before, for its vigorous prosecution.  No man doubted this who
was capable of taking care of himself without the help of a guardian.

It was charged that "they changed sides" in politics; but the sides themselves had been changed
by events, and the substitution of new issues for the old, and nobody could deny this who was
not besotted by party devil-worship or the density of his political ignorance.

They were called "sore-heads" and "disappointed place-hunters;" but the Liberal leaders, in
rebelling against their party in the noon-day of its power, and when honors were within their
grasp, were obliged to "put away ambition" and taste political death, and thus courageously
illustrate the truth that "the duties of life are more than life."  The charge was as glaringly
stupid as it was flagrantly false.

But the novelty of this canvass was equally manifest in the political fellowships it necessitated.
While facing the savage warfare of their former friends Liberal Republicans were suddenly brought
into the most friendly and intimate relations with the men whose recreancy to humanity they
had unsparingly denounced for years.  They were now working with these men because the subjects
on which they had been divided were withdrawn, and the country had entered upon a new dispensation.
The mollifying influence of peace, aided, no doubt, by the organized roguery which in the name
of Republicanism held the Nation by the throat, unveiled to Liberals a new political horizon,
and they gladly exchanged the key-note of hate and war for that of fraternity and reunion.
They saw that the spirit of wrath which had so moved the Northern States during the conflict
was no longer in order.  The more they pondered the policy of amnesty and followed up the work
of the canvass the more thoroughly they became reconstructed in heart.  They discovered that
the men whom they had been denouncing with such hot indignation for so many years were, after
all, very much like other people.  Personally and socially they seemed quite as kindly and
as estimable as the men on the other side, while very many of them had undoubtedly espoused
the cause of slavery under a mistaken view of their constitutional obligations, and as a phase
of patriotism, while sincerely condemning it on principle.  Besides, Democrats had done a very
large and indispensable work in the war for the Union, and they now stood upon common ground
with the Republicans touching the questions on which they had differed.  On these questions
the party platforms were identical.  If their position was accepted as a necessity and not
from choice, they were only a little behind the Republicans, who, as a party, only espoused
the cause of the negro under the whip and spur of military necessity, and not the promptings
of humanity.  In the light of such considerations it was not strange that the Greeley men gladly
accepted their deliverance from the glamour which was blinding the eyes of their old associates
to the policy of reconciliation and peace, and blocking up the pathway of greatly needed reforms.

Soon after the State election I resumed my work on the stump, which included a series of appointment
in Kansas, where I addressed by far the most enthusiastic meetings of the campaign.  My welcome
to the State was made singularly cordial by the part I had played in Congress in opposing enormous
schemes of land monopoly and plunder, which had been concocted by some of her own public servants
in the interest of railway corporations and Indian rings.  On my return to Indiana the signs
of defeat in November became alarming, and they were justified by the result.  It was overwhelming
and stunning. Democrats and Liberals were completely dismayed and bewildered. The cause of
Mr. Greeley's defeat, speaking generally, was the perfectly unscrupulous and desperate hostility
of the party for which he had done more than any other man, living or dead; but the disaster
resulted, more immediately, from the stupid and criminal defection of the Bourbon element in
the Democratic party, which could not be rallied under the banner of an old anti-slavery chief.
Thousands of this class, who sincerely hated Abolitionism, and loved negro slavery more than
they loved their country, voted directly for Grant, while still greater numbers declined to
vote at all.

Greeley, however, received nearly three million votes, being considerably more than Governor
Seymour had received four years before; but General Grant, who had been unanimously nominated
by his party, was elected by two hundred and eighty-six electoral votes, and a popular majority
of nearly three quarters of a million, carrying thirty-one of the thirty-seven States.  To
the sincere friends of political reform the situation seemed hopeless.  The President was re-crowned
our King, and political corruption had now received so emphatic a premium that honesty was
tempted to give up the struggle in despair.  His champions were already talking about a "third
term," while the Republican party had become the representative and champion of great corporations,
and the instrument of organized political corruption and theft.

And yet this fight of Liberals and Democrats was not in vain.  They planted the seed which
ripened into a great popular victory four years later, while the policy of reconciliation for
which they battled against overwhelming odds was hastened by their labors, and has been finally
accepted by the country.  They were still further and more completely vindicated by the misdeeds
of the party they had sought to defeat.  The spectacle of our public affairs became so revolting
that before the middle of General Grant's second term all the great Republican States in the
North were lost to the party, while leading Republicans began to agitate the question of remanding
the States of the South to territorial rule, on account of their disordered condition.  At
the end of this term the Republican majority in the Senate had dwindled from fifty-four to
seventeen, while in the House the majority of one hundred and four had been wiped out to give
place to a Democratic majority of seventy-seven. No vindication of the maligned Liberals of
1872 could have been more complete, while it summoned to the bar of history the party whose
action had thus brought shame upon the Nation and a stain upon Republican institutions.

After the presidential election I went to Washington, where I met Chief Justice Chase in the
Supreme Court and accepted an invitation to dine with him.  He looked so wasted and prematurely
old that I scarcely knew him.  He was very genial, however, and our long political talk was
exceedingly enjoyable.  It seemed to afford him much satisfaction to show me a recently reported
dissenting opinion of his in which he re-asserted his favorite principle of State rights. 
I only met him once afterward, and this was at the inauguration of General Grant.  I called
on Mr. Sumner the same evening, and found him in a wretched state of health, which was aggravated
by the free use of poisonous drugs.  He seemed very much depressed, politically.  He had lost
caste with the great party that had so long idolized him, and which he had done so much to
create and inspire.  He had been deserted by the colored race, to whose service he had unselfishly
dedicated his life.  He had been degraded from his honored place at the head of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations, and for no other reason than the faithful and conscientious
performance of his public duty.  He had been rebuked by the Legislature of his own State. 
His case strikingly suggested that of John Quincy Adams in 1807, when the anathemas of Massachusetts
were showered upon him for leaving the Federalist party when it had accomplished its mission
and survived its character, and joining the supporters of Jefferson.  I sympathized with him
profoundly; but his case was not so infinitely sad as that of poor Greeley, over whose death,
however, the whole Nation seemed to be in mourning.  He had greatly overtaxed himself in his
masterly and brilliant campaign on the stump, in which he displayed unrivaled intellectual
resources and versatility.  He had exhausted himself in watching by the bedside of his dying
wife.  He had been assailed as the enemy of his country by the party which he had done more
than any man in the Nation to organize.  He had been hunted to his grave by political assassins
whose calumnies broke his heart.  He was scarcely less a martyr than Lincoln, or less honored
after his death, and his graceless defamers now seemed to think they could atone for their
crime by singing his praises.  It is easy to speak well of the dead.  It is very easy, even
for base and recreant characters, to laud a man's virtues after he has gone to his grave and
can no longer stand in their path.  It is far easier to praise the dead than do justice to
the living; and it was not strange, therefore, that eminent clergymen and doctors of divinity
who had silently witnessed the peltings of Mr. Greeley by demagogues and mercenaries during
the canvass now poured out their eloquence at his grave.  What he had sorely needed and was
religiously entitled to was the sympathy and succor of good men while he lived, and especially
in his heroic struggle for political reconciliation and reform.  The circumstances of his death
made it peculiarly touching and sacramental, and I was inexpressibly glad that I had fought
his battle so unflinchingly, and defended him everywhere against his conscienceless assailants.

In the early part of the period covered by the preceding chapters our political parties were
divided on mere questions of policy and methods of administration.  Trade, Currency, Internal
Improvements, and the Public Lands were the absorbing issues, while both parties took their
stand against the humanitarian movement which subsequently put those issues completely in abeyance,
and compelled the country to face a question involving not merely the policy of governing,
but the existence of the Government itself.  When the slavery question finally forced its way
into recognition it naturally brought to the front a new class of public men, and their numbers,
as I have shown, steadily increased in each Congress from the year 1845 till the outbreak of
the Rebellion in 1861.  The Congress which came into power with Mr. Lincoln did not fully represent
the anti-slavery spirit of the Northern States, but it was a decided improvement upon its predecessors.
In the Senate were such men as Collamer, Fessenden, Doolittle, Baker, Browning, Anthony, Grimes,
Hale, Harlan, Sherman, Trumbull, Sumner, Wade, Henry Wilson, Chandler, Lane of Indiana, Harris
of New York, Andrew Johnson, B. Gratz Brown and Howard.  In the House were Conkling, Bingham,
Colfax, Dawes, Grow, Hickman, Kelley, Potter, Lovejoy, Pike of Maine, Ashley, Rollins of Missouri,
Shellabarger, Thaddeus Stevens, Elihu B. Washburne, Isaac N. Arnold and James F. Wilson.

During the Rebellion and the years immediately following, Ferry of Connecticut, Creswell, Edmonds,
Conkling, Morgan, Morton, Yates, Carpenter, Hamlin, Henderson, Morrill of Maine, and Schurz,
were added to the prominent men of the Senate and Boutwell, Blair, Henry Winter Davis, Deming,
Jenckes, Garfield, Schenck, Banks, Orth, Raymond, Butler, Hoar, McCrary, to the list in the
House.  During this period the Democrats had in the Senate such men as Bayard, Garrett Davis,
Hicks, Saulsbury, Buckalew, Hendricks, Bright, Reverdy Johnson, Thurman, and F. P. Blair; and
in the House, S. S. Cox, Crittenden, Holman, Kerr, Pendleton, Richardson, Vallandigham, Niblack,
Voorhees, Brooks, Randall, and Woodward.  The men who controlled Congress during these years
of trial were not the intellectual equals of the famous leaders who figured in the great crisis
of 1850, but they were a different and generally a better type.  They were summoned to the
public service to deal with tremendous problems, and lifted up and ennobled by the great cause
they were commissioned to serve.  It did more for them than it was possible for them to do
for it.  It took hold on the very foundations of the Government, and electrified all the springs
of our national life; and although great mistakes were made, and the fervor of this period
was followed by a sickening dispensation of demoralized politics, it was a great privilege
to be permitted to share in the grand battle for the Nation's life, and the work of radical
re- adjustment which followed.

I have already referred to several of the conspicuous characters whose names I have grouped.
Such men as Collamer, Fessenden, Browning and Trumbull, were among the famous lawyers and conservatives
on the Republican side of the Senate.  They were conscientious and unflinching partisans, but
were studiously anxious to save the Union according to the Constitution, and deprecated all
extreme and doubtful measures.  Opposed to them stood Sumner, Wade, Chandler, and their radical
associates, who believed in saving the Union at all hazards, and that not even the Constitution
should be allowed to stay the arm of the Government in blasting the power of the Rebels.  It
was perhaps fortunate for the country that these divisions existed, and held each other in
check.  Mr. Collamer was the impersonation of logical force and the beau ideal of a lawyer
and judge.  There was a sort of majesty in the figure and brow of Fessenden when addressing
the Senate, and his sarcasm was as keen as it was inimitable; but his nature was kindly, and
his integrity perfect.  Trumbull was a less commanding figure, but he greatly honored his position
as chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, and his memory will be held in perpetual
remembrance as the author of the Civil Rights Bill and of the XIII Amendment to the Constitution.
Sumner, I think, was the purest man in the Senate, if not the ablest.  He was pre-eminently
the hero of duty, and the servant of what he believed to be the truth.  No man could have made
a more absolute surrender of himself to his country in the great conflict which threatened
its life.  His weary and jaded look always excited my sympathy, for he seemed to be sacrificing
all the joys of life, and life itself, in his zeal for the public service.  I knew Wade more
intimately than any man in the Senate, through my association with him as a member of the same
Committee for successive years, and was always interested in his personal traits and peculiarities.
He was "a man of uncommon downrightness." There was even a sort of fascination about his profanity.
It had in it a spontaniety and heartiness which made it almost seem the echo of a virtue. 
It was unlike the profane words of Thaddeus Stevens, which were frequently carried on the shafts
of his wit and lost in the laughter it provoked.  Edmunds, now so famous as a lawyer, and leader
in the Senate, and so well known by his reputed resemblance to St. Jerome, was simply respectable
on his first appearance; but his ability, industry, and constant devotion to his duties soon
gave him rank among the prominent men in that body. Grimes of Iowa was one of the really strong
men of this period, while Harlan, his colleague, possessed a vigor and grasp of mind which
I think the public never fully accorded him.  Lane of Indiana was full of patriotic ardor,
and like Baker of Oregon, had the rare gift of eloquent impromptu speech.  Henry Wilson earned
the gratitude of his country by his unswerving loyalty to freedom, and his great labors and
invaluable services as chairman of the Military Committee. Howard ranked among the first lawyers
and most faithful men in the body, and no man had a clearer grasp of the issues of the war.
Henderson was a strong man, whose integrity and political independence were afterward abundantly
proved.  Doolittle was a man of vigor, and made a good record as a Republican, but he naturally
belonged to the other side of the Senate, and finally found his way to it, through the quarrel
with Johnson.

Garrett Davis was always an interesting figure.  His volubility of talk bordered on the miraculous;
and whenever he began to swathe the Senate in his interminable rhetoric it awakened the laughter
or the despair of everybody on the floor or in the galleries. Bayard and Thurman were recognized
as the strong men on their side of the Senate in the Forty-first Congress.  Buckalew was one
of the really sterling men of his party, but he was a modest man, and only appreciated by those
who knew him intimately.  As a leading Democrat, Hendricks stood well in the Senate.  He was
so cautious and diplomatic in temper and so genial and conciliatory in his manner that he glided
smoothly through the rugged conflict of opinions in which his side of the chamber was unavoidably
involved. B. Gratz Brown was known as an intense radical, but he made little mark in this crisis.
He wrote out elaborate and scholarly essays which he read to the Senate, but they received
slight attention from members, and seemed to bear little fruit.  Carpenter, Schurz and Morton
took their seats after the war, and were not long in finding honorable recognition.  Carpenter
was as brilliant and versatile in intellect as he was naturally eloquent in speech and wayward
in morals.  Carl Schurz displayed ability in the famous debate with Morton and Conkling on
the sale of arms to the French, and his political independence in 1872 gave him great prominence
as a Liberal Republican leader; but that virtue has been less conspicuously illustrated in
later years.  Morton became famous soon after he entered the Senate.  The "logic of events"
had revolutionized the opinions so vigorously espoused by him only a few months before, and
his great speech on reconstruction, in which he avowed and defended his change of base, brought
him into great prominence, and multiplied his friends in every section of the country.

In the House, Roscoe Conkling was recognized as a man of considerable talent and great self-esteem.
I have elsewhere referred to his passage at arms with Blaine.  He never linked his name with
any important principle or policy, and was singularly wanting in the qualities of a party leader.
No one questioned his personal integrity, but in later years he was prompt and zealous in the
defense of the worst abuses which found shelter in his party.  Mr. Sherman was shrewd, wiry
and diplomatic, but gave little promise of the career he has since achieved through ambition,
industry and favoring conditions.  Shellabarger was one of the ablest men in the House, and
was so rated.  He was always faithful and vigilant, and I have before given an instance of
this in his timely action on the question of reconstruction.  Mr. Blaine, during the first
years of his service, showed little activity.  He spoke but seldom and briefly, but always
with vigor and effect.  He steadily grew into favor with his party in the House as a man of
force, but without seeming to strive for it.  I think his abilities were never fully appreciated
till he became speaker.  His personal magnetism was as remarkable as his readiness to serve
a friend was unfailing; but, like Mr. Conkling, he never identified himself with any great
legislative measure.

Henry Winter Davis was the most formidable debater in the House. He was full of resources,
while the rapidity of his utterance and the impetuosity of his speech bore down every thing
before it. The fire and force of his personality seemed to make him irresistible, and can only
be likened to the power displayed by Mr. Blaine in the House, in his later and palmier years.
When Gen. Garfield entered the Thirty-eighth Congress there was a winning modesty in his demeanor.
I was interested in his first effort on the floor, which was brief, and marked by evident diffidence.
He was not long, however, in recovering his self-possession, and soon engaged actively in general
debate.  His oratory, at first, was the reverse of winning, owing to the peculiar intonation
of his voice, but gradually improved, while his hunger for knowledge, unflagging industry,
and ambition for distinction, gradually revealed themselves as very clearly defined traits.
During the first years of his service the singular grasp of his mind was not appreciated, but
it was easy to see that he was growing, and that a man of his political ambition and great
industry could not be satisfied with any position of political mediocrity.  His situation as
a Representative of the Nineteenth Ohio District was exceedingly favorable to his aspirations,
as it was the custom of that district to continue a man in its service when once installed,
and its overwhelming majority relieved him of all concern about the result.  He could thus
give his whole time and thought to the study of politics, and the mastery of those historical
and literary pursuits which he afterward made so available in the finish and embellishment
of his speeches.

As a parliamentary leader, Mr. Stevens, of course, was always the central figure in the House.
No possible emergency could disconcert him.  Whether the attack came from friend or foe, or
in whatever form, he was ready, on the instant, to repel it and turn the tables completely
upon his assailant.  He exercised the most absolute freedom of speech, making his thrusts with
the same coolness at "unrighteous copperheads and self-righteous Republicans."  In referring
to the moderate and deprecatory views of Colfax and Olin, in January, 1863, he said he had
always been fifteen years in advance of his party, but never so far ahead that its members
did not overtake him.  His keenest thrusts were frequently made in such a tone and manner as
to disarm them of their sting, and create universal merriment.  When Whaley of West Virginia
begged him, importunately, to yield the floor a moment for a brief statement, while Mr. Stevens
was much engrossed with an important discussion, he finally gave way, saying, "Mr. Speaker,
I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia for a few feeble remarks."  When he lost his temper
and waged war in earnest his invective was absolutely remorseless, as in the example I have
given of it in a previous chapter.

I have before referred to the oratory of Bingham.  He was a reader of books and a master of
English.  He loved poetry, and was one of the most genial and companionable of men, but he
was irritable and crispy in temper, and a formidable customer in debate.  He had several angry
bouts with Butler, in one of which he spoke sneeringly of the "hero of Fort Fisher," to which
Butler replied that the gentleman from Ohio had shown his prowess in the hanging of Mrs. Surratt,
an innocent woman, upon the scaffold.  Bingham retorted that such a charge was "only fit to
come from a man who lives in a bottle, and is fed with a spoon."  He was often dogmatic and
lacking in coolness and balance, but in later years he showed uncommon tact in extricating
himself from the odium threatened by his connection with the Credit Mobilier scheme.

One of the really strong men in the House was John Hickman, of Pennsylvania, who had been a
prominent figure in Congress during Buchanan's administration.  He was a man of brains, courage,
and worth.  Potter was a true and brave man, whose acceptance of a challenge from Roger A.
Pryor, and choice of butcher knives as the weapons of warfare, had made him very popular at
the North.  Rollins of Missouri was an eloquent man, of superior ability and attainments, and
large political experience.  Pike of Maine was one of the first men in the House, but too honest
and independent to sacrifice his convictions for the sake of success.  Deming of Connecticut
was a man of real calibre, and on rare occasions electrified the House by his speeches, but
he lacked industry.  One of the finest debaters in the House was Henry J. Raymond.  He displayed
very decided power in the debate on Reconstruction, and very effectively exposed the weakness
of the Republicans in practically dealing with the Rebel States as if they were at once in
and out of the Union.  Among the most striking figures in the House were Butler and Cox, whose
contests were greatly relished.  They were well matched, and alternately carried off the prize
of victory.  Butler, in the first onset, achieved a decided triumph in his reply to a very
personal assault by Cox.  "As to the vituperation of the member from New York," said he, "he
will hear my answer to him by every boy that whistles it on the street, and every hand-organ,
'Shoo, fly, don't bodder me'!"  Cox, for the time, was extinguished, but patiently watched
his opportunity till he found his revenge, which Butler afterward frankly acknowledged.  For
a time there was bad blood between them, but they finally became friends, and I think so continued.

General Banks was always a notable personality.  His erect figure, military eye, and splendid
voice secured for him the admiring attention of the galleries whenever he addressed the House.
Ashley of Ohio who took the lead in the impeachment movement, in which he was so zealous that
he became known as "Impeachment Ashley," was another picturesque figure.  His fine physique,
frolicsome face, and luxuriant suit of curly brown hair singled him out among the bald heads
of the body as one of its most attractive members. Boutwell impressed the House as a man of
solid qualities, and a formidable debater.  He acquitted himself admirably in his defense of
Butler against a savage attack by Brooks.  Blair was a man of ability, independence, and courage,
of which his record in the House gave ample proof.  Wilson of Iowa was a young man when he
entered Congress, but soon gave proof of his ability, and took rank as one of the best lawyers
on the Judiciary Committee.  Judge Kelley, since known as the "Father of the House," and one
of the fathers of the Greenback movement, first attracted attention by the wonderful volume
and power of his voice.  It filled the entire Hall, and subdued all rival sounds; but to the
surprise of everybody, he met with more than his match when he was followed, one day, by Van
Wyck, of New York, who triumphantly carried off the palm. Kelley's voice was little more than
a zephyr, in comparison with the roar and thunder that followed it and called forth shouts
of laughter, while Kelley quietly occupied his seat as if in dumb amazement at what had happened.

James Brooks was always a conspicuous figure on the Democratic side of the House.  I first
knew him in the log cabin days of 1840, and afterward served with him in the Congress of 1849.
He was a man of ability, a genuine hater of the negro, and a bitter partisan; but I never saw
any reason to doubt his personal integrity, and I think the affair which threw so dark a cloud
over his reputation in later years was a surprise to all who knew him.  Michael C. Kerr was
one of the very first men in the House, and a man of rare purity and worth.  Randall, like
Garfield, was a growing man during the war, and through his ambition, natural abilities, and
Congressional training, he became one of the chief magnates of his party. Pendleton was counted
an able man, and made his mark as a Bourbon Democrat and the champion of hard money; but he
subsequently spoiled his financial record by his scheme for flooding the country with greenbacks.
Vallandigham was conspicuous for his intellectual vigor, passionate earnestness, and hatred
of Abolitionism.  He had the courage of his opinions.  The Republicans hated him consumedly.
He was a member of the House Committee on Public Lands, which reported the Homestead Bill,
and I remember that no Republican member, except the chairman, showed the slightest disposition
to recognize him.  After the war was ended, however, and the work of reconstruction was accomplished,
his temper and qualities seemed to have spent much of their force.  He was among the very first
to plead for acquiescence and the policy of reconciliation; and if his life had been spared
I believe his catholic spirit and active leadership in the "New Departure" would have re-instated
him in the sincere regard of men of all parties.  Lovejoy was the most impassioned orator in
the House.  His speeches were remarkable for their pungency and wit, and when the question
of slavery was under discussion his soul took fire.  He hated slavery with the animosity of
a regular Puritan, and when he talked about it everybody listened. Wickliffe of Kentucky was
one of the most offensive representatives of the Border State policy, and whenever he spoke
Lovejoy was sure to follow.  As often as Wickliffe got the floor it was noticed that Lovejoy's
brow was immediately darkened in token of the impending strife, while his friends and enemies
prepared themselves for the scene.  Wickliffe was a large, fierce-looking man, with a shrill
voice, and quite as belligerent as Lovejoy; and their contests were frequent, and always enjoyed
by the House, and for some time became a regular feature of its business.

Elihu B. Washburne was conspicuous as the champion of economy.  He rivaled Holman as the "watch-dog
of the treasury" and the enemy of land-grants.  He was a man of force, and rendered valuable
service to the country, but he assumed such airs of superior virtue, and frequently lectured
the House in so magisterial a tone as to make himself a little unpopular with members.  This
was strikingly illustrated in 1868, in his controversy with Donnelly of Minnesota against whom
he had made some dishonorable charges through a Minnesota newspaper.  Donnelly was an Irishman,
a wit, and an exceedingly versatile genius, and when it became known that he was to defend
himself in the House against Washburne's charges, and make a counter attack, every member was
in his seat, although the weather was intensely hot and no legislative business was to be transacted.
Donnelly had fully prepared himself, and such a castigation as he administered, has rarely,
if ever, been witnessed in a legislative body.  He kept a ceaseless and overwhelming fire of
wit, irony, and ridicule, for nearly two hours, during which the members frequently laughed
and sometimes applauded, while Washburne sat pale and mute under the infliction.  The tables
were turned upon him, although portions of Donnelly's tirade were unparliamentary, and indefensible
on the score of coarseness and bad taste.  No member, however, raised any point of order; but
the friends of Mr. Washburne afterward surrounded Donnelly, and by artful appeals to his good
nature prevailed upon him to suppress a portion of the speech, and to proffer statements which
tended to destroy its effect and to restore to Washburne the ground he had lost.  The House
had its fun, while Washburne deigned no reply except to re-affirm his charges, and Donnelly's
friends were vexed at his needless surrender of his vantage-ground.  It was an odd and unexpected
denouement of a very remarkable exhibition.

Oakes Ames was one of the members of the House with whom I was best acquainted.  I thought
I knew him well, and I never had the slightest reason to suspect his public or private integrity.
Personally and socially he was one of the kindliest men I ever knew, and I was greatly surprised
when I learned of his connection with the Credit Mobilier project.  It first found its way
into politics through a speech of Horace Greeley near the close of the canvass of 1872, but
it had been fully exposed by Washburn of Wisconsin in a speech in Congress in the year 1868.
The history of its connection with American politics and politicians forms an exceedingly interesting
and curious chapter.  The fate of the men involved in it seems like a perfect travesty of justice
and fair play.  Some of them have gone down under the waves of popular condemnation.  Others,
occupying substantially the same position, according to the evidence, have made their escape
and even been honored and trusted by the public, while still others are quietly whiling away
their lives under the shadow of suspicion.  The case affords a strange commentary upon the
principle of historic justice.

One of the most remarkable facts connected with the first years of the war was the descent
of the Abolitionists upon Washington.  They secured the hall of the Smithsonian Institute for
their meetings, which they held weekly, and at which the Rev. John Pierpont presided. It was
with much difficulty that the hall was procured, and one of the conditions of granting it was
that it should be distinctly understood and announced that the Smithsonian Institute was to
be in no way responsible for anything that might be said by the speakers.  This was very emphatically
insisted on by Professor Henry, and was duly announced at the first meeting.  At the following,
and each succeeding lecture, Mr. Pierpont regularly made the same announcement.  These gatherings
were largely attended and very enthusiastic; and as the anti-slavery tide constantly grew stronger,
the weekly announcement that "the Smithsonian Institute desires it to be distinctly understood
that it is not to be held responsible for the utterances of the speakers," awakened the sense
of the ludicrous, and called forth rounds of applause and explosions of laughter by the audience,
in front of which Professor Henry was seated.  Each meeting thus began with a frolic of good
humor, which Mr. Pierpont evidently enjoyed, for he made his announcement with a gravity which
naturally provoked the mirth which followed.  These meetings were addressed by Wendell Phillips,
Gerrit Smith, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Dr. Brownson, and other notable men, and were enjoyed as
a sort of jubilee by the men and women who attended them.

The services in the Hall of Representatives each Sabbath formed the fitting counterpart of
these proceedings.  The crowds in attendance filled every part of the floor and galleries,
and were full of enthusiasm.  The most terrific arraignment of slavery I ever listened to was
by Rev. Dr. George B. Cheever, in the course of these services.  He was a man of great ability,
unquenchable zeal, fervid eloquence, and an Old Testament Christian who was sometimes called
the Prophet Isaiah of the anti-slavery cause.  He carried his religion courageously into politics,
and while arraigning slavery as the grand rebel, he also severely criticised the management
of the war and the Border State policy of the President.  The most pronounced anti-slavery
sermons were also preached in the Capital by Dr. Boynton, Mr. Channing and others, while the
Hutchinson family occasionally entertained the public with their anti-slavery songs. All this
must have been sufficiently shocking to the slave-holding politics and theology of the city,
whose slumbers were thus rudely disturbed.

There was a peculiar fascination about life in Washington during the war.  The city itself
was unattractive.  Its ragged appearance, wretched streets, and sanitary condition were the
reproach of its citizens, who could have had no dream of the Washington of to-day; but it was
a great military as well as political center.  Our troops were pouring in from every loyal
State, and the drum-beat was heard night and day, while the political and social element hitherto
in the ascendant, was completely submerged by the great flood from the North.  The city was
surrounded, and in part occupied by hospitals, and for a time many of the principal churches
were surrendered to the use of our sick and wounded soldiers, whose numbers were fearfully
swelled after each great battle.  The imminent peril to which the Capital was repeatedly exposed,
and the constantly changing fortunes of the war, added greatly to the interest of the crisis,
and marked the alternations of hope and fear among the friends and enemies of the Union.  But
notwithstanding the seriousness of the times, there was a goodly measure of real social life.
Human nature demanded some relaxation from the dreadful strain and burden of the great conflict,
and this was partially found in the levees of the President and Cabinet ministers, and the
receptions of the Speaker, which were largely attended and greatly enjoyed; and this enjoyment
was doubtless much enhanced by the peculiar bond of union and feeling of brotherhood which
the state of the country awakened among its friends.  The most pleasant of these occasions,
however, were the weekly receptions of the Speaker.  Those of Speaker Grow were somewhat marred,
and sometimes interrupted, by his failing health, but the receptions of Mr. Colfax were singularly
delightful.  He discharged the duties of his great office with marked ability and fairness,
and was personally very popular; and there always gathered about him on these occasions an
assemblage of charming and congenial people, whose genuine cordiality was a rebuke to the insincerity
so often witnessed in social life.

But I need not further pursue these personal details, nor linger over the by-gones of a grand
epoch.  We have entered upon a new dispensation.  The withdrawal of the slavery question from
the strife of parties has changed the face of our politics as completely as did its introduction.
The transition from an abnormal and revolutionary period to the regular and orderly administration
of affairs, has been as remarkable as the intervention of the great question which eclipsed
every other till it compelled its own solution.  Although this transition has given birth to
an era of "slack-water politics," it has gradually brought the country face to face with new
problems, some of which are quite as vital to the existence and welfare of the Republic as
those which have taxed the statesmanship of the past.  The tyranny of industrial domination,
which borrows its life from the alliance of concentrated capital with labor-saving machinery,
must be overthrown.  Commercial feudalism, wielding its power through the machinery of great
corporations which are practically endowed with life officers and the right of hereditary succession
and control the makers and expounders of our laws, must be subordinated to the will of the
people.  The system of agricultural serfdom called Land Monopoly, which is now putting on new
forms of danger in the rapid multiplication of great estates and the purchase of vast bodies
of lands by foreign capitalists, must be resisted as a still more formidable foe of democratic
Government.  The legalized robbery now carried on in the name of Protection to American labor
must be overthrown.  The system of spoils and plunder must also be destroyed, in order that
freedom itself may be rescued from the perilous activities quickened into life by its own spirit,
and the conduct of public affairs inspired by the great moralities which dignify public life.

These are the problems which appeal to the present generation, and especially to the honorable
ambition of young men now entering upon public life.  Their solution is certain, because they
are directly in the path of progress, and progress is a law; but whether it shall be heralded
by the kindly agencies of peace or the harsh power of war, must depend upon the wise and timely
use of opportunities. The result is certain, since justice can not finally be defeated; but
the circumstances of the struggle and the cost of its triumph are committed to the people,
who can scarcely fail to find both instruction and warning in the story of the anti-slavery
conflict.
