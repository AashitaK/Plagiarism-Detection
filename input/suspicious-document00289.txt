DEDICATION

  To Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, Member of the Aulic Council, Author
  of the History of the Ottoman Empire.

  Dear Baron,--You have taken so warm an interest in my long, vast
  "History of French Manners in the Nineteenth Century," you have
  given me so much encouragement to persevere with my work, that you
  have given me a right to associate your name with some portion of
  it. Are you not one of the most important representatives of
  conscientious, studious Germany? Will not your approval win for me
  the approval of others, and protect this attempt of mine? So proud
  am I to have gained your good opinion, that I have striven to
  deserve it by continuing my labors with the unflagging courage
  characteristic of your methods of study, and of that exhaustive
  research among documents without which you could never have given
  your monumental work to the world of letters. Your sympathy with
  such labor as you yourself have bestowed upon the most brilliant
  civilization of the East, has often sustained my ardor through
  nights of toil given to the details of our modern civilization.
  And will not you, whose naive kindliness can only be compared with
  that of our own La Fontaine, be glad to know of this?

  May this token of my respect for you and your work find you at
  Dobling, dear Baron, and put you and yours in mind of one of your
  most sincere admirers and friends.

  DE BALZAC.

THE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUITIES

There stands a house at a corner of a street, in the middle of a town, in one of the least
important prefectures in France, but the name of the street and the name of the town must be
suppressed here. Every one will appreciate the motives of this sage reticence demanded by convention;
for if a writer takes upon himself the office of annalist of his own time, he is bound to touch
on many sore subjects. The house was called the Hotel d'Esgrignon; but let d'Esgrignon be considered
a mere fancy name, neither more nor less connected with real people than the conventional Belval,
Floricour, or Derville of the stage, or the Adalberts and Mombreuses of romance. After all,
the names of the principal characters will be quite as much disguised; for though in this history
the chronicler would prefer to conceal the facts under a mass of contradictions, anachronisms,
improbabilities, and absurdities, the truth will out in spite of him. You uproot a vine-stock,
as you imagine, and the stem will send up lusty shoots after you have ploughed your vineyard over.

The "Hotel d'Esgrignon" was nothing more nor less than the house in which the old Marquis lived;
or, in the style of ancient documents, Charles Marie Victor Ange Carol, Marquis d'Esgrignon.
It was only an ordinary house, but the townspeople and tradesmen had begun by calling it the
Hotel d'Esgrignon in jest, and ended after a score of years by giving it that name in earnest.

The name of Carol, or Karawl, as the Thierrys would have spelt it, was glorious among the names
of the most powerful chieftains of the Northmen who conquered Gaul and established the feudal
system there. Never had Carol bent his head before King or Communes, the Church or Finance.
Intrusted in the days of yore with the keeping of a French March, the title of marquis in their
family meant no shadow of imaginary office; it had been a post of honor with duties to discharge.
Their fief had always been their domain. Provincial nobles were they in every sense of the
word; they might boast of an unbroken line of great descent; they had been neglected by the
court for two hundred years; they were lords paramount in the estates of a province where the
people looked up to them with superstitious awe, as to the image of the Holy Virgin that cures
the toothache. The house of d'Esgrignon, buried in its remote border country, was preserved
as the charred piles of one of Caesar's bridges are maintained intact in a river bed. For thirteen
hundred years the daughters of the house had been married without a dowry or taken the veil;
the younger sons of every generation had been content with their share of their mother's dower
and gone forth to be captains or bishops; some had made a marriage at court; one cadet of the
house became an admiral, a duke, and a peer of France, and died without issue. Never would
the Marquis d'Esgrignon of the elder branch accept the title of duke.

"I hold my marquisate as His Majesty holds the realm of France, and on the same conditions,"
he told the Constable de Luynes, a very paltry fellow in his eyes at that time.

You may be sure that d'Esgrignons lost their heads on the scaffold during the troubles. The
old blood showed itself proud and high even in 1789. The Marquis of that day would not emigrate;
he was answerable for his March. The reverence in which he was held by the countryside saved
his head; but the hatred of the genuine sans-culottes was strong enough to compel him to pretend
to fly, and for a while he lived in hiding. Then, in the name of the Sovereign People, the
d'Esgrignon lands were dishonored by the District, and the woods sold by the Nation in spite
of the personal protest made by the Marquis, then turned forty. Mlle. d'Esgrignon, his half-sister,
saved some portions of the fief, thanks to the young steward of the family, who claimed on
her behalf the partage de presuccession, which is to say, the right of a relative to a portion
of the emigre's lands. To Mlle. d'Esgrignon, therefore, the Republic made over the castle itself
and a few farms. Chesnel [Choisnel], the faithful steward, was obliged to buy in his own name
the church, the parsonage house, the castle gardens, and other places to which his patron was
attached--the Marquis advancing the money.

The slow, swift years of the Terror went by, and the Marquis, whose character had won the respect
of the whole country, decided that he and his sister ought to return to the castle and improve
the property which Maitre Chesnel--for he was now a notary--had contrived to save for them
out of the wreck. Alas! was not the plundered and dismantled castle all too vast for a lord
of the manor shorn of all his ancient rights; too large for the landowner whose woods had been
sold piecemeal, until he could scarce draw nine thousand francs of income from the pickings
of his old estates?

It was in the month of October 1800 that Chesnel brought the Marquis back to the old feudal
castle, and saw with deep emotion, almost beyond his control, his patron standing in the midst
of the empty courtyard, gazing round upon the moat, now filled up with rubbish, and the castle
towers razed to the level of the roof. The descendant of the Franks looked for the missing
Gothic turrets and the picturesque weather vanes which used to rise above them; and his eyes
turned to the sky, as if asking of heaven the reason of this social upheaval. No one but Chesnel
could understand the profound anguish of the great d'Esgrignon, now known as Citizen Carol.
For a long while the Marquis stood in silence, drinking in the influences of the place, the
ancient home of his forefathers, with the air that he breathed; then he flung out a most melancholy
exclamation.

"Chesnel," he said, "we will come back again some day when the troubles are over; I could not
bring myself to live here until the edict of pacification has been published; they will not
allow me to set my scutcheon on the wall."

He waved his hand toward the castle, mounted his horse, and rode back beside his sister, who
had driven over in the notary's shabby basket-chaise.

The Hotel d'Esgrignon in the town had been demolished; a couple of factories now stood on the
site of the aristocrat's house. So Maitre Chesnel spent the Marquis' last bag of louis on the
purchase of the old-fashioned building in the square, with its gables, weather-vane, turret,
and dovecote. Once it had been the courthouse of the bailiwick, and subsequently the presidial;
it had belonged to the d'Esgrignons from generation to generation; and now, in consideration
of five hundred louis d'or, the present owner made it over with the title given by the Nation
to its rightful lord. And so, half in jest, half in earnest, the old house was christened the
Hotel d'Esgrignon.

In 1800 little or no difficulty was made over erasing names from the fatal list, and some few
emigres began to return. Among the very first nobles to come back to the old town were the
Baron de Nouastre and his daughter. They were completely ruined. M. d'Esgrignon generously
offered them the shelter of his roof; and in his house, two months later, the Baron died, worn
out with grief. The Nouastres came of the best blood in the province; Mlle. de Nouastre was
a girl of two-and-twenty; the Marquis d'Esgrignon married her to continue his line. But she
died in childbirth, a victim to the unskilfulness of her physician, leaving, most fortunately,
a son to bear the name of the d'Esgrignons. The old Marquis--he was but fifty-three, but adversity
and sharp distress had added months to every year--the poor old Marquis saw the death of the
loveliest of human creatures, a noble woman in whom the charm of the feminine figures of the
sixteenth century lived again, a charm now lost save to men's imaginations. With her death
the joy died out of his old age. It was one of those terrible shocks which reverberate through
every moment of the years that follow. For a few moments he stood beside the bed where his
wife lay, with her hands folded like a saint, then he kissed her on the forehead, turned away,
drew out his watch, broke the mainspring, and hung it up beside the hearth. It was eleven o'clock
in the morning.

"Mlle. d'Esgrignon," he said, "let us pray God that this hour may not prove fatal yet again
to our house. My uncle the archbishop was murdered at this hour; at this hour also my father
died----"

He knelt down beside the bed and buried his face in the coverlet; his sister did the same,
in another moment they both rose to their feet. Mlle. d'Esgrignon burst into tears; but the
old Marquis looked with dry eyes at the child, round the room, and again on his dead wife.
To the stubbornness of the Frank he united the fortitude of a Christian.

These things came to pass in the second year of the nineteenth century. Mlle. d'Esgrignon was
then twenty-seven years of age. She was a beautiful woman. An ex-contractor for forage to the
armies of the Republic, a man of the district, with an income of six thousand francs, persuaded
Chesnel to carry a proposal of marriage to the lady. The Marquis and his sister were alike
indignant with such presumption in their man of business, and Chesnel was almost heartbroken;
he could not forgive himself for yielding to the Sieur du Croisier's [du Bousquier] blandishments.
The Marquis' manner with his old servant changed somewhat; never again was there quite the
old affectionate kindliness, which might almost have been taken for friendship. From that time
forth the Marquis was grateful, and his magnanimous and sincere gratitude continually wounded
the poor notary's feelings. To some sublime natures gratitude seems an excessive payment; they
would rather have that sweet equality of feeling which springs from similar ways of thought,
and the blending of two spirits by their own choice and will. And Maitre Chesnel had known
the delights of such high friendship; the Marquis had raised him to his own level. The old
noble looked on the good notary as something more than a servant, something less than a child;
he was the voluntary liege man of the house, a serf bound to his lord by all the ties of affection.
There was no balancing of obligations; the sincere affection on either side put them out of
the question.

In the eyes of the Marquis, Chesnel's official dignity was as nothing; his old servitor was
merely disguised as a notary. As for Chesnel, the Marquis was now, as always, a being of a
divine race; he believed in nobility; he did not blush to remember that his father had thrown
open the doors of the salon to announce that "My Lord Marquis is served." His devotion to the
fallen house was due not so much to his creed as to egoism; he looked on himself as one of
the family. So his vexation was intense. Once he had ventured to allude to his mistake in spite
of the Marquis' prohibition, and the old noble answered gravely--"Chesnel, before the troubles
you would not have permitted yourself to entertain such injurious suppositions. What can these
new doctrines be if they have spoiled you?"

Maitre Chesnel had gained the confidence of the whole town; people looked up to him; his high
integrity and considerable fortune contributed to make him a person of importance. From that
time forth he felt a very decided aversion for the Sieur du Crosier; and though there was little
rancor in his composition, he set others against the sometime forage-contractor. Du Croisier,
on the other hand, was a man to bear a grudge and nurse a vengeance for a score of years. He
hated Chesnel and the d'Esgrignon family with the smothered, all-absorbing hate only to be
found in a country town. His rebuff had simply ruined him with the malicious provincials among
whom he had come to live, thinking to rule over them. It was so real a disaster that he was
not long in feeling the consequences of it. He betook himself in desperation to a wealthy old
maid, and met with a second refusal. Thus failed the ambitious schemes with which he had started.
He had lost his hope of a marriage with Mlle. d'Esgrignon, which would have opened the Faubourg
Saint-Germain of the province to him; and after the second rejection, his credit fell away
to such an extent that it was almost as much as he could do to keep his position in the second
rank.

In 1805, M. de la Roche-Guyon, the oldest son of an ancient family which had previously intermarried
with the d'Esgrignons, made proposals in form through Maitre Chesnel for Mlle. Marie Armande
Clair d'Esgrignon. She declined to hear the notary.

"You must have guessed before now that I am a mother, dear Chesnel," she said; she had just
put her nephew, a fine little boy of five, to bed.

The old Marquis rose and went up to his sister, but just returned from the cradle; he kissed
her hand reverently, and as he sat down again, found words to say:

"My sister, you are a d'Esgrignon."

A quiver ran through the noble girl; the tears stood in her eyes. M. d'Esgrignon, the father
of the present Marquis, had married a second wife, the daughter of a farmer of taxes ennobled
by Louis XIV. It was a shocking mesalliance in the eyes of his family, but fortunately of no
importance, since a daughter was the one child of the marriage. Armande knew this. Kind as
her brother had always been, he looked on her as a stranger in blood. And this speech of his
had just recognized her as one of the family.

And was not her answer the worthy crown of eleven years of her noble life? Her every action
since she came of age had borne the stamp of the purest devotion; love for her brother was
a sort of religion with her.

"I shall die Mlle. d'Esgrignon," she said simply, turning to the notary.

"For you there could be no fairer title," returned Chesnel, meaning to convey a compliment.
Poor Mlle. d'Esgrignon reddened.

"You have blundered, Chesnel," said the Marquis, flattered by the steward's words, but vexed
that his sister had been hurt. "A d'Esgrignon may marry a Montmorency; their descent is not
so pure as ours. The d'Esgrignons bear or, two bends, gules," he continued, "and nothing during
nine hundred years has changed their scutcheon; as it was at first, so it is to-day. Hence
our device, Cil est nostre, taken at a tournament in the reign of Philip Augustus, with the
supporters, a knight in armor or on the right, and a lion gules on the left."

"I do not remember that any woman I have ever met has struck my imagination as Mlle. d'Esgrignon
did," said Emile Blondet, to whom contemporary literature is indebted for this history among
other things. "Truth to tell, I was a boy, a mere child at the time, and perhaps my memory-pictures
of her owe something of their vivid color to a boy's natural turn for the marvelous.

"If I was playing with other children on the Parade, and she came to walk there with her nephew
Victurnien, the sight of her in the distance thrilled me with very much the effect of galvanism
on a dead body. Child as I was, I felt as though new life had been given me.

"Mlle. Armande had hair of tawny gold; there was a delicate fine down on her cheek, with a
silver gleam upon it which I loved to catch, putting myself so that I could see the outlines
of her face lit up by the daylight, and feel the fascination of those dreamy emerald eyes,
which sent a flash of fire through me whenever they fell upon my face. I used to pretend to
roll on the grass before her in our games, only to try to reach her little feet, and admire
them on a closer view. The soft whiteness of her skin, her delicate features, the clearly cut
lines of her forehead, the grace of her slender figure, took me with a sense of surprise, while
as yet I did not know that her shape was graceful, nor her brows beautiful, nor the outline
of her face a perfect oval. I admired as children pray at that age, without too clearly understanding
why they pray. When my piercing gaze attracted her notice, when she asked me (in that musical
voice of hers, with more volume in it, as it seemed to me, than all other voices), 'What are
you doing little one? Why do you look at me?'--I used to come nearer and wriggle and bite my
finger-nails, and redden and say, 'I do not know.' And if she chanced to stroke my hair with
her white hand, and ask me how old I was, I would run away and call from a distance, 'Eleven!'

"Every princess and fairy of my visions, as I read the Arabian Nights, looked and walked like
Mlle. d'Esgrignon; and afterwards, when my drawing-master gave me heads from the antique to
copy, I noticed that their hair was braided like Mlle. d'Esgrignon's. Still later, when the
foolish fancies had vanished one by one, Mlle. Armande remained vaguely in my memory as a type;
that Mlle. Armande for whom men made way respectfully, following the tall brown-robed figure
with their eyes along the Parade and out of sight. Her exquisitely graceful form, the rounded
curves sometimes revealed by a chance gust of wind, and always visible to my eyes in spite
of the ample folds of stuff, revisited my young man's dreams. Later yet, when I came to think
seriously over certain mysteries of human thought, it seemed to me that the feeling of reverence
was first inspired in me by something expressed in Mlle. d'Esgrignon's face and bearing. The
wonderful calm of her face, the suppressed passion in it, the dignity of her movements, the
saintly life of duties fulfilled,--all this touched and awed me. Children are more susceptible
than people imagine to the subtle influences of ideas; they never make game of real dignity;
they feel the charm of real graciousness, and beauty attracts them, for childhood itself is
beautiful, and there are mysterious ties between things of the same nature.

"Mlle. d'Esgrignon was one of my religions. To this day I can never climb the staircase of
some old manor-house but my foolish imagination must needs picture Mlle. Armande standing there,
like the spirit of feudalism. I can never read old chronicles but she appears before my eyes
in the shape of some famous woman of old times; she is Agnes Sorel, Marie Touchet, Gabrielle;
and I lend her all the love that was lost in her heart, all the love that she never expressed.
The angel shape seen in glimpses through the haze of childish fancies visits me now sometimes
across the mists of dreams."

Keep this portrait in mind; it is a faithful picture and sketch of character. Mlle. d'Esgrignon
is one of the most instructive figures in this story; she affords an example of the mischief
that may be done by the purest goodness for lack of intelligence.

Two-thirds of the emigres returned to France during 1804 and 1805, and almost every exile from
the Marquis d'Esgrignon's province came back to the land of his fathers. There were certainly
defections. Men of good birth entered the service of Napoleon, and went into the army or held
places at the Imperial court, and others made alliances with the upstart families. All those
who cast in their lots with the Empire retrieved their fortunes and recovered their estates,
thanks to the Emperor's munificence; and these for the most part went to Paris and stayed there.
But some eight or nine families still remained true to the proscribed noblesse and loyal to
the fallen monarchy. The La Roche-Guyons, Nouastres, Verneuils, Casterans, Troisvilles, and
the rest were some of them rich, some of them poor; but money, more or less, scarcely counted
for anything among them. They took an antiquarian view of themselves; for them the age and
preservation of the pedigree was the one all-important matter; precisely as, for an amateur,
the weight of metal in a coin is a small matter in comparison with clean lettering, a flawless
stamp, and high antiquity. Of these families, the Marquis d'Esgrignon was the acknowledged
head. His house became their cenacle. There His Majesty, Emperor and King, was never anything
but "M. de Bonaparte"; there "the King" meant Louis XVIII., then at Mittau; there the Department
was still the Province, and the prefecture the intendance.

The Marquis was honored among them for his admirable behavior, his loyalty as a noble, his
undaunted courage; even as he was respected throughout the town for his misfortunes, his fortitude,
his steadfast adherence to his political convictions. The man so admirable in adversity was
invested with all the majesty of ruined greatness. His chivalrous fair-mindedness was so well
known, that litigants many a time had referred their disputes to him for arbitration. All gently
bred Imperialists and the authorities themselves showed as much indulgence for his prejudices
as respect for his personal character; but there was another and a large section of the new
society which was destined to be known after the Restoration as the Liberal party; and these,
with du Croisier as their unacknowledged head, laughed at an aristocratic oasis which nobody
might enter without proof of irreproachable descent. Their animosity was all the more bitter
because honest country squires and the higher officials, with a good many worthy folk in the
town, were of the opinion that all the best society thereof was to be found in the Marquis
d'Esgrignon's salon. The prefect himself, the Emperor's chamberlain, made overtures to the
d'Esgrignons, humbly sending his wife (a Grandlieu) as ambassadress.

Wherefore, those excluded from the miniature provincial Faubourg Saint-Germain nicknamed the
salon "The Collection of Antiquities," and called the Marquis himself "M. Carol." The receiver
of taxes, for instance, addressed his applications to "M. Carol (ci-devant des Grignons),"
maliciously adopting the obsolete way of spelling.

"For my own part," said Emile Blondet, "if I try to recall my childhood memories, I remember
that the nickname of 'Collection of Antiquities' always made me laugh, in spite of my respect--my
love, I ought to say--for Mlle. d'Esgrignon. The Hotel d'Esgrignon stood at the angle of two
of the busiest thoroughfares in the town, and not five hundred paces away from the market place.
Two of the drawing-room windows looked upon the street and two upon the square; the room was
like a glass cage, every one who came past could look through it from side to side. I was only
a boy of twelve at the time, but I thought, even then, that the salon was one of those rare
curiosities which seem, when you come to think of them afterwards, to lie just on the borderland
between reality and dreams, so that you can scarcely tell to which side they most belong.

"The room, the ancient Hall of Audience, stood above a row of cellars with grated air-holes,
once the prison cells of the old court-house, now converted into a kitchen. I do not know that
the magnificent lofty chimney-piece of the Louvre, with its marvelous carving, seemed more
wonderful to me than the vast open hearth of the salon d'Esgrignon when I saw it for the first
time. It was covered like a melon with a network of tracery. Over it stood an equestrian portrait
of Henri III., under whom the ancient duchy of appanage reverted to the crown; it was a great
picture executed in low relief, and set in a carved and gilded frame. The ceiling spaces between
the chestnut cross-beams in the fine old roof were decorated with scroll-work patterns; there
was a little faded gilding still left along the angles. The walls were covered with Flemish
tapestry, six scenes from the Judgment of Solomon, framed in golden garlands, with satyrs and
cupids playing among the leaves. The parquet floor had been laid down by the present Marquis,
and Chesnel had picked up the furniture at sales of the wreckage of old chateaux between 1793
and 1795; so that there were Louis Quatorze consoles, tables, clock-cases, andirons, candle-sconces
and tapestry-covered chairs, which marvelously completed a stately room, large out of all proportion
to the house. Luckily, however, there was an equally lofty ante-chamber, the ancient Salle
des Pas Perdus of the presidial, which communicated likewise with the magistrate's deliberating
chamber, used by the d'Esgrignons as a dining-room.

"Beneath the old paneling, amid the threadbare braveries of a bygone day, some eight or ten
dowagers were drawn up in state in a quavering line; some with palsied heads, others dark and
shriveled like mummies; some erect and stiff, others bowed and bent, but all of them tricked
out in more or less fantastic costumes as far as possible removed from the fashion of the day,
with be-ribboned caps above their curled and powdered 'heads,' and old discolored lace. No
painter however earnest, no caricature however wild, ever caught the haunting fascination of
those aged women; they come back to me in dreams; their puckered faces shape themselves in
my memory whenever I meet an old woman who puts me in mind of them by some faint resemblance
of dress or feature. And whether it is that misfortune has initiated me into the secrets of
irremediable and overwhelming disaster; whether that I have come to understand the whole range
of human feelings, and, best of all, the thoughts of Old Age and Regret; whatever the reason,
nowhere and never again have I seen among the living or in the faces of the dying the wan look
of certain gray eyes that I remember, nor the dreadful brightness of others that were black.

"Neither Hoffmann nor Maturin, the two weirdest imaginations of our time, ever gave me such
a thrill of terror as I used to feel when I watched the automaton movements of those bodies
sheathed in whalebone. The paint on actors' faces never caused me a shock; I could see below
it the rouge in grain, the rouge de naissance, to quote a comrade at least as malicious as
I can be. Years had leveled those women's faces, and at the same time furrowed them with wrinkles,
till they looked like the heads on wooden nutcrackers carved in Germany. Peeping in through
the window-panes, I gazed at the battered bodies, and ill-jointed limbs (how they were fastened
together, and, indeed, their whole anatomy was a mystery I never attempted to explain); I saw
the lantern jaws, the protuberant bones, the abnormal development of the hips; and the movements
of these figures as they came and went seemed to me no whit less extraordinary than their sepulchral
immobility as they sat round the card-tables.

"The men looked gray and faded like the ancient tapestries on the wall, in dress they were
much more like the men of the day, but even they were not altogether convincingly alive. Their
white hair, their withered waxen-hued faces, their devastated foreheads and pale eyes, revealed
their kinship to the women, and neutralized any effects of reality borrowed from their costume.

"The very certainty of finding all these folk seated at or among the tables every day at the
same hours invested them at length in my eyes with a sort of spectacular interest as it were;
there was something theatrical, something unearthly about them.

"Whenever, in after times, I have gone through museums of old furniture in Paris, London, Munich,
or Vienna, with the gray-headed custodian who shows you the splendors of time past, I have
peopled the rooms with figures from the Collection of Antiquities. Often, as little schoolboys
of eight or ten we used to propose to go and take a look at the curiosities in their glass
cage, for the fun of the thing. But as soon as I caught sight of Mlle. Armande's sweet face,
I used to tremble; and there was a trace of jealousy in my admiration for the lovely child
Victurnien, who belonged, as we all instinctively felt, to a different and higher order of
being from our own. It struck me as something indescribably strange that the young fresh creature
should be there in that cemetery awakened before the time. We could not have explained our
thoughts to ourselves, yet we felt that we were bourgeois and insignificant in the presence
of that proud court."

The disasters of 1813 and 1814, which brought about the downfall of Napoleon, gave new life
to the Collection of Antiquities, and what was more than life, the hope of recovering their
past importance; but the events of 1815, the troubles of the foreign occupation, and the vacillating
policy of the Government until the fall of M. Decazes, all contributed to defer the fulfilment
of the expectations of the personages so vividly described by Blondet. This story, therefore,
only begins to shape itself in 1822.

In 1822 the Marquis d'Esgrignon's fortunes had not improved in spite of the changes worked
by the Restoration in the condition of emigres. Of all the nobles hardly hit by Revolutionary
legislation, his case was the hardest. Like other great families, the d'Esgrignons before 1789
derived the greater part of their income from their rights as lords of the manor in the shape
of dues paid by those who held of them; and, naturally, the old seigneurs had reduced the size
of the holdings in order to swell the amounts paid in quit-rents and heriots. Families in this
position were hopelessly ruined. They were not affected by the ordinance by which Louis XVIII.
put the emigres into possession of such of their lands as had not been sold; and at a later
date it was impossible that the law of indemnity should indemnify them. Their suppressed rights,
as everybody knows, were revived in the shape of a land tax known by the very name of domaines,
but the money went into the coffers of the State.

The Marquis by his position belonged to that small section of the Royalist party which would
hear of no kind of compromise with those whom they styled, not Revolutionaries, but revolted
subjects, or, in more parliamentary language, they had no dealings with Liberals or Constitutionnels.
Such Royalists, nicknamed Ultras by the opposition, took for leaders and heroes those courageous
orators of the Right, who from the very beginning attempted, with M. de Polignac, to protest
against the charter granted by Louis XVIII. This they regarded as an ill-advised edict extorted
from the Crown by the necessity of the moment, only to be annulled later on. And, therefore,
so far from co-operating with the King to bring about a new condition of things, the Marquis
d'Esgrignon stood aloof, an upholder of the straitest sect of the Right in politics, until
such time as his vast fortune should be restored to him. Nor did he so much as admit the thought
of the indemnity which filled the minds of the Villele ministry, and formed a part of a design
of strengthening the Crown by putting an end to those fatal distinctions of ownership which
still lingered on in spite of legislation.

The miracles of the Restoration of 1814, the still greater miracle of Napoleon's return in
1815, the portents of a second flight of the Bourbons, and a second reinstatement (that almost
fabulous phase of contemporary history), all these things took the Marquis by surprise at the
age of sixty-seven. At that time of life, the most high-spirited men of their age were not
so much vanquished as worn out in the struggle with the Revolution; their activity, in their
remote provincial retreats, had turned into a passionately held and immovable conviction; and
almost all of them were shut in by the enervating, easy round of daily life in the country.
Could worse luck befall a political party than this--to be represented by old men at a time
when its ideas are already stigmatized as old-fashioned?

When the legitimate sovereign appeared to be firmly seated on the throne again in 1818, the
Marquis asked himself what a man of seventy should do at court; and what duties, what office
he could discharge there? The noble and high-minded d'Esgrignon was fain to be content with
the triumph of the Monarchy and Religion, while he waited for the results of that unhoped-for,
indecisive victory, which proved to be simply an armistice. He continued as before, lord-paramount
of his salon, so felicitously named the Collection of Antiquities.

But when the victors of 1793 became the vanquished in their turn, the nickname given at first
in jest began to be used in bitter earnest. The town was no more free than other country towns
from the hatreds and jealousies bred of party spirit. Du Croisier, contrary to all expectation,
married the old maid who had refused him at first; carrying her off from his rival, the darling
of the aristocratic quarter, a certain Chevalier whose illustrious name will be sufficiently
hidden by suppressing it altogether, in accordance with the usage formerly adopted in the place
itself, where he was known by his title only. He was "the Chevalier" in the town, as the Comte
d'Artois was "Monsieur" at court. Now, not only had that marriage produced a war after the
provincial manner, in which all weapons are fair; it had hastened the separation of the great
and little noblesse, of the aristocratic and bourgeois social elements, which had been united
for a little space by the heavy weight of Napoleonic rule. After the pressure was removed,
there followed that sudden revival of class divisions which did so much harm to the country.

The most national of all sentiments in France is vanity. The wounded vanity of the many induced
a thirst for Equality; though, as the most ardent innovator will some day discover, Equality
is an impossibility. The Royalists pricked the Liberals in the most sensitive spots, and this
happened specially in the provinces, where either party accused the other of unspeakable atrocities.
In those days the blackest deeds were done in politics, to secure public opinion on one side
or the other, to catch the votes of that public of fools which holds up hands for those that
are clever enough to serve out weapons to them. Individuals are identified with their political
opinions, and opponents in public life forthwith became private enemies. It is very difficult
in a country town to avoid a man-to-man conflict of this kind over interests or questions which
in Paris appear in a more general and theoretical form, with the result that political combatants
also rise to a higher level; M. Laffitte, for example, or M. Casimir-Perier can respect M.
de Villele or M. de Payronnet as a man. M. Laffitte, who drew the fire on the Ministry, would
have given them an asylum in his house if they had fled thither on the 29th of July 1830. Benjamin
Constant sent a copy of his work on Religion to the Vicomte de Chateaubriand, with a flattering
letter acknowledging benefits received from the former Minister. At Paris men are systems,
whereas in the provinces systems are identified with men; men, moreover, with restless passions,
who must always confront one another, always spy upon each other in private life, and pull
their opponents' speeches to pieces, and live generally like two duelists on the watch for
a chance to thrust six inches of steel between an antagonist's ribs. Each must do his best
to get under his enemy's guard, and a political hatred becomes as all-absorbing as a duel to
the death. Epigram and slander are used against individuals to bring the party into discredit.

In such warfare as this, waged ceremoniously and without rancor on the side of the Antiquities,
while du Croisier's faction went so far as to use the poisoned weapons of savages--in this
warfare the advantages of wit and delicate irony lay on the side of the nobles. But it should
never be forgotten that the wounds made by the tongue and the eyes, by gibe or slight, are
the last of all to heal. When the Chevalier turned his back on mixed society and entrenched
himself on the Mons Sacer of the aristocracy, his witticisms thenceforward were directed at
du Croisier's salon; he stirred up the fires of war, not knowing how far the spirit of revenge
was to urge the rival faction. None but purists and loyal gentlemen and women sure one of another
entered the Hotel d'Esgrignon; they committed no indiscretions of any kind; they had their
ideas, true or false, good or bad, noble or trivial, but there was nothing to laugh at in all
this. If the Liberals meant to make the nobles ridiculous, they were obliged to fasten on the
political actions of their opponents; while the intermediate party, composed of officials and
others who paid court to the higher powers, kept the nobles informed of all that was done and
said in the Liberal camp, and much of it was abundantly laughable. Du Croisier's adherents
smarted under a sense of inferiority, which increased their thirst for revenge.

In 1822, du Croisier put himself at the head of the manufacturing interest of the province,
as the Marquis d'Esgrignon headed the noblesse. Each represented his party. But du Croisier,
instead of giving himself out frankly for a man of the extreme Left, ostensibly adopted the
opinions formulated at a later date by the 221 deputies.

By taking up this position, he could keep in touch with the magistrates and local officials
and the capitalists of the department. Du Croisier's salon, a power at least equal to the salon
d'Esgrignon, larger numerically, as well as younger and more energetic, made itself felt all
over the countryside; the Collection of Antiquities, on the other hand, remained inert, a passive
appendage, as it were, of a central authority which was often embarrassed by its own partisans;
for not merely did they encourage the Government in a mistaken policy, but some of its most
fatal blunders were made in consequence of the pressure brought to bear upon it by the Conservative
party.

The Liberals, so far, had never contrived to carry their candidate. The department declined
to obey their command knowing that du Croisier, if elected, would take his place on the Left
Centre benches, and as far as possible to the Left. Du Croisier was in correspondence with
the Brothers Keller, the bankers, the oldest of whom shone conspicuous among "the nineteen
deputies of the Left," that phalanx made famous by the efforts of the entire Liberal press.
This same M. Keller, moreover, was related by marriage to the Comte de Gondreville, a Constitutional
peer who remained in favor with Louis XVIII. For these reasons, the Constitutional Opposition
(as distinct from the Liberal party) was always prepared to vote at the last moment, not for
the candidate whom they professed to support, but for du Croisier, if that worthy could succeed
in gaining a sufficient number of Royalist votes; but at every election du Croisier was regularly
thrown out by the Royalists. The leaders of that party, taking their tone from the Marquis
d'Esgrignon, had pretty thoroughly fathomed and gauged their man; and with each defeat, du
Croisier and his party waxed more bitter. Nothing so effectually stirs up strife as the failure
of some snare set with elaborate pains.

In 1822 there seemed to be a lull in hostilities which had been kept up with great spirit during
the first four years of the Restoration. The salon du Croisier and the salon d'Esgrignon, having
measured their strength and weakness, were in all probability waiting for opportunity, that
Providence of party strife. Ordinary persons were content with the surface quiet which deceived
the Government; but those who knew du Croisier better, were well aware that the passion of
revenge in him, as in all men whose whole life consists in mental activity, is implacable,
especially when political ambitions are involved. About this time du Croisier, who used to
turn white and red at the bare mention of d'Esgrignon or the Chevalier, and shuddered at the
name of the Collection of Antiquities, chose to wear the impassive countenance of a savage.
He smiled upon his enemies, hating them but the more deeply, watching them the more narrowly
from hour to hour. One of his own party, who seconded him in these calculations of cold wrath,
was the President of the Tribunal, M. du Ronceret, a little country squire, who had vainly
endeavored to gain admittance among the Antiquities.

The d'Esgrignons' little fortune, carefully administered by Maitre Chesnel, was barely sufficient
for the worthy Marquis' needs; for though he lived without the slightest ostentation, he also
lived like a noble. The governor found by his Lordship the Bishop for the hope of the house,
the young Comte Victurnien d'Esgrignon, was an elderly Oratorian who must be paid a certain
salary, although he lived with the family. The wages of a cook, a waiting-woman for Mlle. Armande,
an old valet for M. le Marquis, and a couple of other servants, together with the daily expenses
of the household, and the cost of an education for which nothing was spared, absorbed the whole
family income, in spite of Mlle. Armande's economies, in spite of Chesnel's careful management,
and the servants' affection. As yet, Chesnel had not been able to set about repairs at the
ruined castle; he was waiting till the leases fell in to raise the rent of the farms, for rents
had been rising lately, partly on account of improved methods of agriculture, partly by the
fall in the value of money, of which the landlord would get the benefit at the expiration of
leases granted in 1809.

The Marquis himself knew nothing of the details of the management of the house or of his property.
He would have been thunderstruck if he had been told of the excessive precautions needed "to
make both ends of the year meet in December," to use the housewife's saying, and he was so
near the end of his life, that every one shrank from opening his eyes. The Marquis and his
adherents believed that a House, to which no one at Court or in the Government gave a thought,
a House that was never heard of beyond the gates of the town, save here and there in the same
department, was about to revive its ancient greatness, to shine forth in all its glory. The
d'Esgrignons' line should appear with renewed lustre in the person of Victurnien, just as the
despoiled nobles came into their own again, and the handsome heir to a great estate would be
in a position to go to Court, enter the King's service, and marry (as other d'Esgrignons had
done before him) a Navarreins, a Cadignan, a d'Uxelles, a Beausant, a Blamont-Chauvry; a wife,
in short, who should unite all the distinctions of birth and beauty, wit and wealth, and character.

The intimates who came to play their game of cards of an evening--the Troisvilles (pronounced
Treville), the La Roche-Guyons, the Casterans (pronounced Cateran), and the Duc de Verneuil--had
all so long been accustomed to look up to the Marquis as a person of immense consequence, that
they encouraged him in such notions as these. They were perfectly sincere in their belief;
and indeed, it would have been well founded if they could have wiped out the history of the
last forty years. But the most honorable and undoubted sanctions of right, such as Louis XVIII.
had tried to set on record when he dated the Charter from the one-and-twentieth year of his
reign, only exist when ratified by the general consent. The d'Esgrignons not only lacked the
very rudiments of the language of latter-day politics, to wit, money, the great modern relief,
or sufficient rehabilitation of nobility; but, in their case, too, "historical continuity"
was lacking, and that is a kind of renown which tells quite as much at Court as on the battlefield,
in diplomatic circles as in Parliament, with a book, or in connection with an adventure; it
is, as it were, a sacred ampulla poured upon the heads of each successive generation. Whereas
a noble family, inactive and forgotten, is very much in the position of a hard-featured, poverty-stricken,
simple-minded, and virtuous maid, these qualifications being the four cardinal points of misfortune.
The marriage of a daughter of the Troisvilles with General Montcornet, so far from opening
the eyes of the Antiquities, very nearly brought about a rupture between the Troisvilles and
the salon d'Esgrignon, the latter declaring that the Troisvilles were mixing themselves up
with all sorts of people.

There was one, and one only, among all these folk who did not share their illusions. And that
one, needless to say, was Chesnel the notary. "Deg, did you say?"

"Yes, sir."

The manufacturer seemed to hitch himself off toward his own side of the gig, gave another look at her, and
was silent.

The poor woman was somewhat astonished at his look and movement, and
was silent too.

After awhile Mr. Spires said again, "And do you hope to find friends
in Stockington?

Had you none where you came from?"

"None, sir, none in the world!" said the poor woman, and again her
feelings seemed too strong for her.

At length she added, "I was in service, sir, at Poole, in Dorsetshire,
when I married; my mother only was living, and while I was away with
my husband, she died.

When-when the news came from abroad--that when I was a widow, sir,
I went back to my native place, and the parish officers said I must
go to my husband's parish lest I and my child should become troublesome."

"You

asked relief
of them?"

"Never; Oh, God knows, no, never!

My family have never asked a penny of a parish.

They would die first, and so would I, sir; but they said I might
do it, and I had better go to my husband's parish at once--and they
offered me money to go."

"And you took it, of course?"

"No, sir; I had a little money, which I had earned by washing and
laundering, and I sold most of my things, as I could not carry them,
and came off.

I felt hurt, sir; my heart rose against the treatment of the parish,
and I thought I should be better amongst my friends--and my child
would, if anything happened to me; I had no friends of my own."

Mr. Spires looked at the woman in silence. "Did your husband tell you anything
of his friends? What sort of a man was he?"

"Oh, he was a gay young fellow, rather, sir; but not bad to me. He
always said his friends were well off in Stockington."

"He did!" said the manufacturer, with a great stare, and as if bolting
the words from his heart in a large gust of wonder.

The poor woman again looked at him with a strange look.

The manufacturer Whistled to himself, and giving his horse a smart cut with the whip, drove on faster than
ever. The night was fast settling down; it was numbing cold; a gray fog rose from the river as they
thundered over the old bridge; and tall engine chimneys, and black
smoky houses loomed through the dusk before them.

They were at Stockington.

As they slackened their pace up a hill at the entrance of the town,
Mr. Spires again opened his mouth.

"I should be sorry to hurt your feelings, Mrs. Deg," he said, "but
I have my fears that you are coming to this place with false expectations.

I fear your husband did not give you the truest possible account of
his family here."

"Oh, sir! what--what is it?" exclaimed the poor woman; "in God's name, tell me!"

"Why, nothing more than this," said the manufacturer, "that there are very
few of the Degs left here.

They are old, and on the parish, and can do nothing for you."

The poor woman gave a deep sigh, and was silent.

"But don't be cast down," said Mr. Spires.

He would not tell her what a pauper family really was, for he saw that she was a very feeling woman,
and he thought she would learn that soon enough. He felt that her husband had from vanity given her
a false account of his connections; and he was really sorry for her.

"Don't be cast down," he went on; "you can wash and iron, you say; you
are young and strong: those are your friends. Depend on them, and
they'll be better friends to you than any other."

The poor woman was silent, leaning her head down on her slumbering
child, and crying to herself; and thus they drove on, through many long
and narrow streets, with gas flaring from the shops, but with few
people in the streets, and these hurrying shivering along the pavement,
so intense was the cold.

Anon they stopped at a large pair of gates; the manufacturer rung a bell, which he could reach from
his gig, and the gates presently were flung open, and they drove into a spacious yard, with a large
handsome house, having a bright lamp burning before it, on one side
of the yard, and tall warehouses on the other.

"Show this poor woman and her child to Mrs. Craddock's, James," said
Mr. Spires, "and tell Mrs. Craddock to make them very comfortable;
and if you will come to my warehouse to-morrow," added he, addressing
the poor woman, "perhaps I can be of some use to you."

The poor woman poured out her heartfelt thanks, and following the
old man-servant, soon disappeared, hobbling over the pebbly pavement
with her living load, stiffened almost to stone by her fatigue and
her cold ride.

We must not pursue too minutely our narrative Mrs. Deg was engaged
to do the washing and getting up of Mr. Spires' linen, and the manner
in which she executed her task insured her recommendations to all
their friends.

Mrs. Deg was at once in full employ. She occupied a neat house in a
yard near the meadows below the town, and in those meadows she might
be seen spreading out her clothes to whiten on the grass, attended
by her stout little boy.

In the same yard lived a shoemaker, who had two or three children of about
the same age as Mrs. Deg's child. The children, as time went on, became
playfellows. Little Simon might be said to have the free run of the shoemaker's
house, and he was the more attracted thither by the shoemaker's birds,
and by his flute, on which he often played after his work was done.

Mrs. Deg took a great friendship for this shoemaker; and he and his
wife, a quiet, kind-hearted woman, were almost all the acquaintances
that she cultivated.

She had found out her husband's parents, but they were not of a description that at all pleased her. They
were old and infirm, but they were of the true pauper breed, a sort
of person whom Mrs. Deg had been taught to avoid and to despise.

They looked on her as a sort of second parish, and insisted that she should come and live with them,
and help to maintain them out of her earnings. But Mrs. Deg would rather her little boy had died than
have been familiarized with the spirit and habits of those old people. Despise them she struggled
hard not to do, and she agreed to allow them sufficient to maintain them on condition that they desisted
from any further application to the parish. It would be a long and
disgusting story to recount all the troubles, annoyance, and querulous
complaints, and even bitter accusations that she received from these
connections, whom she could never satisfy; but she considered it
one of the crosses in her life, and patiently bore it, seeing that
they suffered no real want, so long as they lived, which was for years;
but she would never allow her little Simon to be with them alone.

The shoemaker neighbor was a stout protection to her against the greedy
demands of these old people, and of others of the old Degs, and also
against another class of inconvenient visitors, namely, suitors,
who saw in Mrs. Deg a neat and comely young woman, with a flourishing
business and a neat and soon well-furnished house, a very desirable
acquisition.

But Mrs. Deg had resolved never again to marry, but to live for her
boy, and she kept her resolve in firmness and gentleness.

The shoemaker often took walks in the extensive town meadows, to gather
groundsell and plantain for his canaries and gorse-linnets, and little
Simon Deg delighted to accompany him with his own children.

There William Watson, the shoemaker, used to point out to the children
the beauty of the flowers, the insects, and other objects of nature;
and while he sat on a style and read in a little old book of poetry,
as he often used to do, the children sat on the summer grass, and enjoyed
themselves in a variety of plays.

The effect of these walks and the shoemaker's conversation on little
Simon Deg was such as never wore out of him through his whole life,
and soon led him to astonish the shoemaker by his extraordinary conduct.

He manifested the utmost uneasiness at their treading on the flowers
in the grass; he would burst with tears if they persisted in it; and
when asked why, he said they were so beautiful, that they must enjoy
the sunshine, and be very unhappy to die.

The shoemaker was amazed, but indulged the lad's fancy. One day he thought to give him a great treat, and when they
were out in the meadows, he drew from under his coat a bow and arrow,
and shot the arrow high up in the air.

He expected to see him in an ecstasy of delight: his own children clapped their hands in transport,
but Simon stood silent, and as if awe-struck.

"Shall I send up another?" asked the shoemaker.

"No, no," exclaimed the child, imploringly. "You say God lives up there, and he mayn't like it."

The
shoemaker laughed, but presently he said, as if to himself, "There
is too much imagination there.

There will be a poet, if we don't take care."

The shoemaker offered to teach Simon to read, and to solidify his
mind, as he termed it, by arithmetic, and then to teach him to work
at his trade.

His mother was very glad, and thought shoemaking would be a good trade
for the boy; and that with Mr. Watson she should have him always near
her.

He was growing now a great lad, and was especially strong, and of a frank and daring habit. He was especially
indignant at any act of oppression of the weak by the strong, and not seldom got into trouble by his championship
of the injured in such cases among the boys of the neighborhood.

He was now about twelve years of age; when, going one day with a basket
of clothes on his head to Mr. Spires's for his mother, he was noticed
by Mr. Spires himself from his counting-house window.

The great war was raging; there was much distress among the manufacturers; and the people were suffering
and exasperated against their masters. Mr. Spires, as a staunch tory, and supporter of the war,
was particularly obnoxious to the workpeople, who uttered violent
threats against him.

For this reason his premises were strictly guarded, and at the entrance
of his yard, just within the gates, was chained a huge and fierce
mastiff, his chain allowing him to approach near enough to intimidate
any stranger, though not to reach him.

The dog knew the people who came regularly about, and seemed not to
notice them, but on the entrance of a stranger, he rose up, barked
fiercely, and came to the length of his chain.

This always drew the attention of the porter, if he were away from his box, and few persons dared to
pass till he came.

Simon Deg was advancing with the basket of clean linen on his head,
when the dog rushed out, and barking loudly, came exactly opposite
to him, within a few feet.

The boy, a good deal startled at first, reared himself with his back against
the wall, but at a glance perceiving that the dog was at the length
of his tether, he seemed to enjoy his situation, and stood smiling
at the furious animal, and lifting his basket with both hands above
his head, nodded to him, as if to say, "Well, old boy, you'd like
to eat me, wouldn't you?"

Mr. Spires, who sat near his counting-house window at his books, was
struck with the bold and handsome bearing of the boy, and said to
a clerk:

"What boy is that?"

"It is Jenny Deg's," was the answer.

"Ha! that boy! Zounds! how boys do grow! Why that's the child that Jenny
Deg was carrying when she came to Stockington: and what a strong,
handsome, bright-looking fellow he is now!"

As the boy was returning, Mr. Spires called him to the counting-house
door, and put some questions to him as to what he was doing and learning,
and so on.

Simon, taking off his cap with much respect, answered in such a clear
and Modest way, and with a voice that had so much feeling and natural
music in it, that the worthy manufacturer was greatly taken with him.

"That's no Deg," said he, when he again entered the counting-house,
"not a bit of it.

He's all Goodrick, or whatever his mother's name was, every inch of
him."

The consequence of that interview was, that Simon Deg was very soon after
Perched on a stool in Mr. Spires's counting-house, where he continued till
he was twenty-two. Mr. Spires had no son, only a single daughter; and
such were Simon Deg's talents, attention to business, and genial disposition,
that at that age Mr. Spires gave him a share in the concern.

He was himself now getting less fond of exertion than he had been, and placed the most
implicit reliance on Simon's judgment and general management. Yet no two
men could be more unlike in their opinions beyond the circle of trade.

Mr. Spires was a staunch tory of the staunch old school. He was for
Church and King, and for things remaining forever as they had been. Simon,
on the other hand, had liberal and reforming notions. He was for the
improvement of the people, and their admission to many privileges.

Mr. Spires
was therefore liked by the leading men of the place, and disliked by the people.
Simon's estimation was precisely in the opposite direction.

But this did not disturb their friendship; it required another disturbing cause--and
that came.

Simon Deg and the daughter of Mr. Spires grew attached to each other;
and as the father had thought Simon worthy of becoming a partner in
the business, neither of the young people deemed that he would object
to a partnership of a more domestic description.

But here they made a tremendous mistake. No sooner was such a proposal
hinted at, than Mr. Spires burst forth with the fury of all the winds
from the bag of Ulysses.

"What! a Deg aspire to the hand of the sole heiress
of the enormously opulent Spires?"

The very thought almost cut the proud manufacturer off with an apoplexy.
The hosts of a thousand paupers rose up before him, and he was black
in the face.

It was only by a prompt and bold application of leeches and lancet
that the life of the great man was saved. But there was an end of
all further friendship between himself and the expectant Simon.

He insisted that
he should withdraw from the concern, and it was done. Simon, who felt
his own dignity deeply wounded too, for dignity he had, though the last of
a long line of paupers--his own dignity, not his ancestors'--took silently,
yet not unrespectfully, his share--a good, round sum, and entered
another house of business.

For several years there appeared to be a feud and a bitterness between the former
friends; yet it showed itself in no other manner than by a careful
avoidance of each other.

The continental war came to an end; the manufacturing distress increased
exceedingly.

There came troublous times, and a fierce warfare of politics.

Great Stockington was torn asunder by rival parties.

On one side stood preeminent, Mr. Spires;
on the other towered conspicuously, Simon Deg.

Simon was grown rich, and extremely popular.

He was on all occasions the advocate of the people.

He said that he had sprung from, and was one of them. He had bought
a large tract of land on one side of the town; and intensely fond of the
country and flowers himself, he had divided this into gardens, built little
summer-houses in them, and let them to the artisans.

In his factory he had introduced order, cleanliness, and ventilation.
He had set up a school for the children in the evenings, with a reading-room
and conversation-room for the work-people, and encouraged them to bring
their families there, and enjoy music, books, and lectures.

Accordingly, he was the idol of the people, and the horror of the
old school of manufacturers.

"A pretty upstart and demagogue I've nurtured," said Mr. Spires often,
to his wife and daughter, who only sighed, and were silent.

Then came a furious election.

The town, for a fortnight, more resembled the worst corner
of Tartarus than a Christian borough. Drunkenness, riot, pumping on one
another, spencering one another, all sorts of violence and abuse
ruled and raged till the blood of all Stockington was at boiling heat.

In the midst of the tempest were everywhere seen, ranged on the opposite
sides, Mr. Spires, now old and immensely corpulent, and Simon Deg,
active, buoyant, zealous, and popular beyond measure.

But popular though he was, the other and old tory side
still triumphed. The people were exasperated to madness; and when the
chairing of the successful candidate commenced, there was a terrific
attack made on the procession by the defeated party.

Down went the
chair, and the new member, glad to escape into an inn, saw his friends
mercilessly assailed by the populace. There was a tremendous tempest
of sticks, brickbats, paving-stones, and rotten eggs. In the midst
of all this, Simon Deg and a number of his friends, standing at the
upper window of an hotel, saw Mr. Spires knocked down and trampled
on by the crowd. In an instant, and before his friends had missed
him from amongst them, Simon Deg was seen darting through the raging
mass, cleaving his way with a surprising vigor, and gesticulating,
and no doubt shouting vehemently to the rioters, though his voice
was lost in the din.

In the next moment his hat was knocked off,
and himself appeared in imminent danger: but, another moment, and
there was a pause, and a group of people were bearing somebody from
the frantic mob into a neighboring shop. It was Simon Deg, assisting
in the rescue of his old friend and benefactor, Mr. Spires.

Mr. Spires was a good deal bruised, and wonderfully confounded and bewildered
by his fall. His clothes were one mass of mud, and his face was bleeding
copiously; but when he had had a good draught of water, and his face
washed, and had time to recover himself, it was found that he had
received no serious injury.

"They had like to have done for me, though," said he.

"Yes, and who saved you?" asked a gentleman.

"Ay, who was it? who
was it?" asked the really warm-hearted manufacturer; "let me know? I
owe him my life."

"There he is!" said several gentlemen, at the same instant, pushing forward
Simon Deg.

"What, Simon!" said Mr. Spires, starting to his feet. "Was it thee, my
boy?" He did more, he stretched out his hand; the young man clasped it
eagerly, and the two stood silent, and with a heart-felt emotion, which blended
all the past into forgetfulness, and the future into a union more
sacred than esteem.

A week hence, and Simon Deg was the son-in-law of Mr. Spires. Though Mr.
Spires had misunderstood Simon, and Simon had borne the aspect of
opposition to his old friend, in defense of conscientious principle,
the wife and daughter of the manufacturer had always understood him,
and secretly looked forward to some day of recognition and reunion.

Simon Deg was now the richest man in Stockington. His mother was still living
to enjoy his elevation. She had been his excellent and wise housekeeper,
and she continued to occupy that post still.

Twenty-five years afterward, when the worthy old Spires was dead, and
Simon Deg had himself two sons attained to manhood; when he had five
times been mayor of Stockington, and had been knighted on the presentation
of a loyal address; still his mother was living to see it; and William
Watson, the shoemaker, was acting as a sort of orderly at Sir Simon's
chief manufactory.

He occupied the lodge, and walked about,
and saw that all was safe, and moving on as it should do.

It was amazing how the most plebeian name of Simon Deg had slid, under
the hands of the heralds, into the really aristocratical one of Sir
Simon Degge.

They had traced him up a collateral
kinship, spite of his own consciousness, to a baronet of the same name
of the county of Stafford, and had given him a coat of arms that was
really astonishing.

It was some years before this, that Sir Roger Rockville had breathed his last.
His title and estate had fallen into litigation. Owing to two generations
having passed without any issue of the Rockville family except the
one son and heir, the claims, though numerous, were so mingled with
obscuring circumstance, and so equally balanced, that the lawyers raised
quibbles and difficulties enough to keep the property in Chancery,
till they had not only consumed all the ready money and rental, but
had made frightful inroads into the estate itself.

To save the remnant, the contending
parties came to a compromise. A neighboring squire, whose grandfather
had married a Rockville, was allowed to secure the title, on condition
that the rest carried off the residuum of the estate.

The woods and lands of
Rockville were announced for sale!

It was at
this juncture that old William Watson reminded Sir Simon Degge of a
conversation in the great grove of Rockville, which they had held
at the time that Sir Roger was endeavoring to drive the people thence.

"What a divine pleasure might this man enjoy," said Simon Deg to his
humble friend, "if he had a heart capable of letting others enjoy themselves."

"But
we talk without the estate," said William Watson; "what might we
do if we were tried with it?"

Sir Simon was silent for a moment; then observed that there was sound
philosophy in William Watson's remark. He said no more, but went away;
and the next day announced to the astonished old man that he had purchased
the groves and the whole ancient estate of Rockville!

Sir Simon Degge,
the last of a long line of paupers, was become the possessor of the
noble estate of Sir Roger Rockville, of Rockville, the last of a long
line of aristocrats! But that night, as he lay awake, he thought that
such doctrines as these were fatal in times when there was one law for everybody, and foresaw
the first beginnings of the ruin of the d'Esgrignons.

But for these explanations which depict one side of provincial life in the time of the Empire
and the Restoration, it would not be easy to understand the opening scene of this history,
an incident which took place in the great salon one evening towards the end of October 1822.
The card-tables were forsaken, the Collection of Antiquities--elderly nobles, elderly countesses,
young marquises, and simple baronesses--had settled their losses and winnings. The master of
the house was pacing up and down the room, while Mlle. Armande was putting out the candles
on the card-tables. He was not taking exercise alone, the Chevalier was with him, and the two
wrecks of the eighteenth century were talking of Victurnien. The Chevalier had undertaken to
broach the subject with the Marquis.

"Yes, Marquis," he was saying, "your son is wasting his time and his youth; you ought to send
him to court."

"I have always thought," said the Marquis, "that if my great age prevents me from going to
court--where, between ourselves, I do not know what I should do among all these new people
whom his Majesty receives, and all that is going on there--that if I could not go myself, I
could at least send my son to present our homage to His Majesty. The King surely would do something
for the Count--give him a company, for instance, or a place in the Household, a chance, in
short, for the boy to win his spurs. My uncle the Archbishop suffered a cruel martyrdom; I
have fought for the cause without deserting the camp with those who thought it their duty to
follow the Princes. I held that while the King was in France, his nobles should rally round
him.--Ah! well, no one gives us a thought; a Henry IV. would have written before now to the
d'Esgrignons, 'Come to me, my friends; we have won the day!'--After all, we are something better
than the Troisvilles, yet here are two Troisvilles made peers of France; and another, I hear,
represents the nobles in the Chamber." (He took the upper electoral colleges for assemblies
of his own order.) "Really, they think no more of us than if we did not exist. I was waiting
for the Princes to make their journey through this part of the world; but as the Princes do
not come to us, we must go to the Princes."

"I am enchanted to learn that you think of introducing our dear Victurnien into society," the
Chevalier put in adroitly. "He ought not to bury his talents in a hole like this town. The
best fortune that he can look for here is to come across some Norman girl" (mimicking the accent),
"country-bred, stupid, and rich. What could he make of her?--his wife? Oh! good Lord!"

"I sincerely hope that he will defer his marriage until he has obtained some great office or
appointment under the Crown," returned the gray-haired Marquis. "Still, there are serious difficulties
in the way."

And these were the only difficulties which the Marquis saw at the outset of his son's career.

"My son, the Comte d'Esgrignon, cannot make his appearance at court like a tatterdemalion,"
he continued after a pause, marked by a sigh; "he must be equipped. Alas! for these two hundred
years we have had no retainers. Ah! Chevalier, this demolition from top to bottom always brings
me back to the first hammer stroke delivered by M. de Mirabeau. The one thing needful nowadays
is money; that is all that the Revolution has done that I can see. The King does not ask you
whether you are a descendant of the Valois or a conquerer of Gaul; he asks whether you pay
a thousand francs in tailles which nobles never used to pay. So I cannot well send the Count
to court without a matter of twenty thousand crowns----"

"Yes," assented the Chevalier, "with that trifling sum he could cut a brave figure."

"Well," said Mlle. Armande, "I have asked Chesnel to come to-night. Would you believe it, Chevalier,
ever since the day when Chesnel proposed that I should marry that miserable du Croisier----"

"Ah! that was truly unworthy, mademoiselle!" cried the Chevalier.

"Unpardonable!" said the Marquis.

"Well, since then my brother has never brought himself to ask anything whatsoever of Chesnel,"
continued Mlle. Armande.

"Of your old household servant? Why, Marquis, you would do Chesnel honor--an honor which he
would gratefully remember till his latest breath."

"No," said the Marquis, "the thing is beneath one's dignity, it seems to me."

"There is not much question of dignity; it is a matter of necessity," said the Chevalier, with
the trace of a shrug.

"Never," said the Marquis, riposting with a gesture which decided the Chevalier to risk a great
stroke to open his old friend's eyes.

"Very well," he said, "since you do not know it, I will tell you myself that Chesnel has let
your son have something already, something like----"

"My son is incapable of accepting anything whatever from Chesnel," the Marquis broke in, drawing
himself up as he spoke. "He might have come to you to ask you for twenty-five louis----"

"Something like a hundred thousand livres," said the Chevalier, finishing his sentence.

"The Comte d'Esgrignon owes a hundred thousand livres to a Chesnel!" cried the Marquis, with
every sign of deep pain. "Oh! if he were not an only son, he should set out to-night for Mexico
with a captain's commission. A man may be in debt to money-lenders, they charge a heavy interest,
and you are quits; that is right enough; but Chesnel! a man to whom one is attached!----"

"Yes, our adorable Victurnien has run through a hundred thousand livres, dear Marquis," resumed
the Chevalier, flicking a trace of snuff from his waistcoat; "it is not much, I know. I myself
at his age---- But, after all, let us let old memories be, Marquis. The Count is living in
the provinces; all things taken into consideration, it is not so much amiss. He will not go
far; these irregularities are common in men who do great things afterwards----"

"And he is sleeping upstairs, without a word of this to his father," exclaimed the Marquis.

"Sleeping innocently as a child who has merely got five or six little bourgeoises into trouble,
and now must have duchesses," returned the Chevalier.

"Why, he deserves a lettre de cachet!"

"'They' have done away with lettres de cachet," said the Chevalier. "You know what a hubbub
there was when they tried to institute a law for special cases. We could not keep the provost's
courts, which M. de Bonaparte used to call commissions militaires."

"Well, well; what are we to do if our boys are wild, or turn out scapegraces? Is there no locking
them up in these days?" asked the Marquis.

The Chevalier looked at the heartbroken father and lacked courage to answer, "We shall be obliged
to bring them up properly."

"And you have never said a word of this to me, Mlle. d'Esgrignon," added the Marquis, turning
suddenly round upon Mlle. Armande. He never addressed her as Mlle. d'Esgrignon except when
he was vexed; usually she was called "my sister."

"Why, monsieur, when a young man is full of life and spirits, and leads an idle life in a town
like this, what else can you expect?" asked Mlle. d'Esgrignon. She could not understand her
brother's anger.

"Debts! eh! why, hang it all!" added the Chevalier. "He plays cards, he has little adventures,
he shoots,--all these things are horribly expensive nowadays."

"Come," said the Marquis, "it is time to send him to the King. I will spend to-morrow morning
in writing to our kinsmen."

"I have some acquaintance with the Ducs de Navarreins, de Lenoncourt, de Maufrigneuse, and
de Chaulieu," said the Chevalier, though he knew, as he spoke, that he was pretty thoroughly
forgotten.

"My dear Chevalier, there is no need of such formalities to present a d'Esgrignon at court,"
the Marquis broke in.--"A hundred thousand livres," he muttered; "this Chesnel makes very free.
This is what comes of these accursed troubles. M. Chesnel protects my son. And now I must ask
him.... No, sister, you must undertake this business. Chesnel shall secure himself for the
whole amount by a mortgage on our lands. And just give this harebrained boy a good scolding;
he will end by ruining himself if he goes on like this."

The Chevalier and Mlle. d'Esgrignon thought these words perfectly simple and natural, absurd
as they would have sounded to any other listener. So far from seeing anything ridiculous in
the speech, they were both very much touched by a look of something like anguish in the old
noble's face. Some dark premonition seemed to weigh upon M. d'Esgrignon at that moment, some
glimmering of an insight into the changed times. He went to the settee by the fireside and
sat down, forgetting that Chesnel would be there before long; that Chesnel, of whom he could
not bring himself to ask anything.

Just then the Marquis d'Esgrignon looked exactly as any imagination with a touch of romance
could wish. He was almost bald, but a fringe of silken, white locks, curled at the tips, covered
the back of his head. All the pride of race might be seen in a noble forehead, such as you
may admire in a Louis XV., a Beaumarchais, a Marechal de Richelieu, it was not the square,
broad brow of the portraits of the Marechal de Saxe; nor yet the small hard circle of Voltaire,
compact to overfulness; it was graciously rounded and finely moulded, the temples were ivory
tinted and soft; and mettle and spirit, unquenched by age, flashed from the brilliant eyes.
The Marquis had the Conde nose and the lovable Bourbon mouth, from which, as they used to say
of the Comte d'Artois, only witty and urbane words proceed. His cheeks, sloping rather than
foolishly rounded to the chin, were in keeping with his spare frame, thin legs, and plump hands.
The strangulation cravat at his throat was of the kind which every marquis wears in all the
portraits which adorn eighteenth century literature; it is common alike to Saint-Preux and
to Lovelace, to the elegant Montesquieu's heroes and to Diderot's homespun characters (see
the first editions of those writers' works).

The Marquis always wore a white, gold-embroidered, high waistcoat, with the red ribbon of a
commander of the Order of St. Louis blazing upon his breast; and a blue coat with wide skirts,
and fleur-de-lys on the flaps, which were turned back--an odd costume which the King had adopted.
But the Marquis could not bring himself to give up the Frenchman's knee-breeches nor yet the
white silk stockings or the buckles at the knees. After six o'clock in the evening he appeared
in full dress.

He read no newspapers but the Quotidienne and the Gazette de France, two journals accused by
the Constitutional press of obscurantist views and uncounted "monarchical and religious" enormities;
while the Marquis d'Esgrignon, on the other hand, found heresies and revolutionary doctrines
in every issue. No matter to what extremes the organs of this or that opinion may go, they
will never go quite far enough to please the purists on their own side; even as the portrayer
of this magnificent personage is pretty certain to be accused of exaggeration, whereas he has
done his best to soften down some of the cruder tones and dim the more startling tints of the
original.

The Marquis d'Esgrignon rested his elbows on his knees and leant his head on his hands. During
his meditations Mlle. Armande and the Chevalier looked at one another without uttering the
thoughts in their minds. Was he pained by the discovery that his son's future must depend upon
his sometime land steward? Was he doubtful of the reception awaiting the young Count? Did he
regret that he had made no preparation for launching his heir into that brilliant world of
court? Poverty had kept him in the depths of his province; how should he have appeared at court?
He sighed heavily as he raised his head.

That sigh, in those days, came from the real aristocracy all over France; from the loyal provincial
noblesse, consigned to neglect with most of those who had drawn sword and braved the storm
for the cause.

"What have the Princes done for the du Guenics, or the Fontaines, or the Bauvans, who never
submitted?" he muttered to himself. "They fling miserable pensions to the men who fought most
bravely, and give them a royal lieutenancy in a fortress somewhere on the outskirts of the
kingdom."

Evidently the Marquis doubted the reigning dynasty. Mlle. d'Esgrignon was trying to reassure
her brother as to the prospects of the journey, when a step outside on the dry narrow footway
gave them notice of Chesnel's coming. In another moment Chesnel appeared; Josephin, the Count's
gray-aired valet, admitted the notary without announcing him.

"Chesnel, my boy----" (Chesnel was a white-haired man of sixty-nine, with a square-jawed, venerable
countenance; he wore knee-breeches, ample enough to fill several chapters of dissertation in
the manner of Sterne, ribbed stockings, shoes with silver clasps, an ecclesiastical-looking
coat and a high waistcoat of scholastic cut.)

"Chesnel, my boy, it was very presumptuous of you to lend money to the Comte d'Esgrignon! If
I repaid you at once and we never saw each other again, it would be no more than you deserve
for giving wings to his vices."

There was a pause, a silence such as there falls at court when the King publicly reprimands
a courtier. The old notary looked humble and contrite.

"I am anxious about that boy, Chesnel," continued the Marquis in a kindly tone; "I should like
to send him to Paris to serve His Majesty. Make arrangements with my sister for his suitable
appearance at court.--And we will settle accounts----"

The Marquis looked grave as he left the room with a friendly gesture of farewell to Chesnel.

"I thank M. le Marquis for all his goodness," returned the old man, who still remained standing.

Mlle. Armande rose to go to the door with her brother; she had rung the bell, old Josephin
was in readiness to light his master to his room.

"Take a seat, Chesnel," said the lady, as she returned, and with womanly tact she explained
away and softened the Marquis' harshness. And yet beneath that harshness Chesnel saw a great
affection. The Marquis' attachment for his old servant was something of the same order as a
man's affection for his dog; he will fight any one who kicks the animal, the dog is like a
part of his existence, a something which, if not exactly himself, represents him in that which
is nearest and dearest--his sensibilities.

"It is quite time that M. le Comte should be sent away from the town, mademoiselle," he said
sententiously.

"Yes," returned she. "Has he been indulging in some new escapade?"

"No, mademoiselle."

"Well, why do you blame him?"

"I am not blaming him, mademoiselle. No, I am not blaming him. I am very far from blaming him.
I will even say that I shall never blame him, whatever he may do."

There was a pause. The Chevalier, nothing if not quick to take in a situation, began to yawn
like a sleep-ridden mortal. Gracefully he made his excuses and went, with as little mind to
sleep as to go and drown himself. The imp Curiosity kept the Chevalier wide awake, and with
airy fingers plucked away the cotton wool from his ears.

"Well, Chesnel, is it something new?" Mlle. Armande began anxiously.

"Yes, things that cannot be told to M. le Marquis; he would drop down in an apoplectic fit."

"Speak out," she said. With her beautiful head leant on the back of her low chair, and her
arms extended listlessly by her side, she looked as if she were waiting passively for her deathblow.

"Mademoiselle, M. le Comte, with all his cleverness, is a plaything in the hands of mean creatures,
petty natures on the lookout for a crushing revenge. They want to ruin us and bring us low!
There is the President of the Tribunal, M. de Ronceret; he has, as you know, a very great notion
of his descent----"

"His grandfather was an attorney," interposed Mlle. Armande.

"I know he was. And for that reason you have not received him; nor does he go to M. de Troisville's,
nor to M. le Duc de Verneuil's, nor to the Marquis de Casteran's; but he is one of the pillars
of du Croisier's salon. Your nephew may rub shoulders with young M. Fabien du Ronceret without
condescending too far, for he must have companions of his own age. Well and good. That young
fellow is at the bottom of all M. le Comte's follies; he and two or three of the rest of them
belong to the other side, the side of M. le Chevalier's enemy, who does nothing but breathe
threats of vengeance against you and all the nobles together. They all hope to ruin you through
your nephew. The ringleader of the conspiracy is this sycophant of a du Croisier, the pretended
Royalist. Du Croisier's wife, poor thing, knows nothing about it; you know her, I should have
heard of it before this if she had ears to hear evil. For some time these wild young fellows
were not in the secret, nor was anybody else; but the ringleaders let something drop in jest,
and then the fools got to know about it, and after the Count's recent escapades they let fall
some words while they were drunk. And those words were carried to me by others who are sorry
to see such a fine, handsome, noble, charming lad ruining himself with pleasure. So far people
feel sorry for him; before many days are over they will--I am afraid to say what----"

"They will despise him; say it out, Chesnel!" Mlle. Armande cried piteously.

"Ah! How can you keep the best people in the town from finding out faults in their neighbors?
They do not know what to do with themselves from morning to night. And so M. le Comte's losses
at play are all reckoned up. Thirty thousand francs have taken flight during these two months,
and everybody wonders where he gets the money. If they mention it when I am present, I just
call them to order. Ah! but--'Do you suppose' (I told them this morning), 'do you suppose that
if the d'Esgrignon family have lost their manorial rights, that therefore they have been robbed
of their hoard of treasure? The young Count has a right to do as he pleases; and so long as
he does not owe you a half-penny, you have no right to say a word.'"

Mlle, Armande held out her hand, and the notary kissed it respectfully.

"Good Chesnel!... But, my friend, how shall we find the money for this journey? Victurnien
must appear as befits his rank at court."

"Oh! I have borrowed money on Le Jard, mademoiselle."

"What? You have nothing left! Ah, heaven! what can we do to reward you?"

"You can take the hundred thousand francs which I hold at your disposal. You can understand
that the loan was negotiated in confidence, so that it might not reflect on you; for it is
known in the town that I am closely connected with the d'Esgrignon family."

Tears came into Mlle. Armande's eyes. Chesnel saw them, took a fold of the noble woman's dress
in his hands, and kissed it.

"Never mind," he said, "a lad must sow his wild oats. In great salons in Paris his boyish ideas
will take a new turn. And, really, though our old friends here are the worthiest folk in the
world, and no one could have nobler hearts than they, they are not amusing. If M. le Comte
wants amusement, he is obliged to look below his rank, and he will end by getting into low
company."

Next day the old traveling coach saw the light, and was sent to be put in repair. In a solemn
interview after breakfast, the hope of the house was duly informed of his father's intentions
regarding him--he was to go to court and ask to serve His Majesty. He would have time during
the journey to make up his mind about his career. The navy or the army, the privy council,
an embassy, or the Royal Household,--all were open to a d'Esgrignon, a d'Esgrignon had only
to choose. The King would certainly look favorably upon the d'Esgrignons, because they had
asked nothing of him, and had sent the youngest representative of their house to receive the
recognition of Majesty.

But young d'Esgrignon, with all his wild pranks, had guessed instinctively what society in
Paris meant, and formed his own opinions of life. So when they talked of his leaving the country
and the paternal roof, he listened with a grave countenance to his revered parent's lecture,
and refrained from giving him a good deal of information in reply. As, for instance, that young
men no longer went into the army or the navy as they used to do; that if a man had a mind to
be a second lieutenant in a cavalry regiment without passing through a special training in
the Ecoles, he must first serve in the Pages; that sons of the greatest houses went exactly
like commoners to Saint-Cyr and the Ecole polytechnique, and took their chances of being beaten
by base blood. If he had enlightened his relatives on these points, funds might not have been
forthcoming for a stay in Paris; so he allowed his father and Aunt Armande to believe that
he would be permitted a seat in the King's carriages, that he must support his dignity at court
as the d'Esgrignon of the time, and rub shoulders with great lords of the realm.

It grieved the Marquis that he could send but one servant with his son; but he gave him his
own valet Josephin, a man who can be trusted to take care of his young master, and to watch
faithfully over his interests. The poor father must do without Josephin, and hope to replace
him with a young lad.

"Remember that you are a Carol, my boy," he said; "remember that you come of an unalloyed descent,
and that your scutcheon bears the motto Cil est nostre; with such arms you may hold your head
high everywhere, and aspire to queens. Render grace to your father, as I to mine. We owe it
to the honor of our ancestors, kept stainless until now, that we can look all men in the face,
and need bend the knee to none save a mistress, the King, and God. This is the greatest of
your privileges."

Chesnel, good man, was breakfasting with the family. He took no part in counsels based on heraldry,
nor in the inditing of letters addressed to divers mighty personages of the day; but he had
spent the night in writing to an old friend of his, one of the oldest established notaries
of Paris. Without this letter it is not possible to understand Chesnel's real and assumed fatherhood.
It almost recalls Daedalus' address to Icarus; for where, save in old mythology, can you look
for comparisons worthy of this man of antique mould?

  "MY DEAR AND ESTIMABLE SORBIER,--I remember with no little
  pleasure that I made my first campaign in our honorable profession
  under your father, and that you had a liking for me, poor little
  clerk that I was. And now I appeal to old memories of the days
  when we worked in the same office, old pleasant memories for our
  hearts, to ask you to do me the one service that I have ever asked
  of you in the course of our long lives, crossed as they have been
  by political catastrophes, to which, perhaps, I owe it that I have
  the honor to be your colleague. And now I ask this service of you,
  my friend, and my white hairs will be brought with sorrow to the
  grave if you should refuse my entreaty. It is no question of
  myself or of mine, Sorbier, for I lost poor Mme. Chesnel, and I
  have no child of my own. Something more to me than my own family
  (if I had one) is involved--it is the Marquis d'Esgrignon's only
  son. I have had the honor to be the Marquis' land steward ever
  since I left the office to which his father sent me at his own
  expense, with the idea of providing for me. The house which
  nurtured me has passed through all the troubles of the Revolution.
  I have managed to save some of their property; but what is it,
  after all, in comparison with the wealth that they have lost? I
  cannot tell you, Sorbier, how deeply I am attached to the great
  house, which has been all but swallowed up under my eyes by the
  abyss of time. M. le Marquis was proscribed, and his lands
  confiscated, he was getting on in years, he had no child.
  Misfortunes upon misfortunes! Then M. le Marquis married, and his
  wife died when the young Count was born, and to-day this noble,
  dear, and precious child is all the life of the d'Esgrignon
  family; the fate of the house hangs upon him. He has got into debt
  here with amusing himself. What else should he do in the provinces
  with an allowance of a miserable hundred louis? Yes, my friend, a
  hundred louis, the great house has come to this.

  "In this extremity his father thinks it necessary to send the
  Count to Paris to ask for the King's favor at court. Paris is a
  very dangerous place for a lad; if he is to keep steady there, he
  must have the grain of sense which makes notaries of us. Besides,
  I should be heartbroken to think of the poor boy living amid such
  hardships as we have known.--Do you remember the pleasure with
  which we spent a day and a night there waiting to see The Marriage
  of Figaro? Oh, blind that we were!--We were happy and poor, but a
  noble cannot be happy in poverty. A noble in want--it is a thing
  against nature! Ah! Sorbier, when one has known the satisfaction
  of propping one of the grandest genealogical trees in the kingdom
  in its fall, it is so natural to interest oneself in it and to
  grow fond of it, and love it and water it and look to see it
  blossom. So you will not be surprised at so many precautions on my
  part; you will not wonder when I beg the help of your lights, so
  that all may go well with our young man.

  "Keep yourself informed of his movements and doings, of the
  company which he keeps, and watch over his connections with women.
  M. le Chevalier says that an opera dancer often costs less than a
  court lady. Obtain information on that point and let me know. If
  you are too busy, perhaps Mme. Sorbier might know what becomes of
  the young man, and where he goes. The idea of playing the part of
  guardian angel to such a noble and charming boy might have
  attractions for her. God will remember her for accepting the
  sacred trust. Perhaps when you see M. le Comte Victurnien, her
  heart may tremble at the thought of all the dangers awaiting him
  in Paris; he is very young, and handsome; clever, and at the same
  time disposed to trust others. If he forms a connection with some
  designing woman, Mme. Sorbier could counsel him better than you
  yourself could do. The old man-servant who is with him can tell
  you many things; sound Josephin, I have told him to go to you in
  delicate matters.

  "But why should I say more? We once were clerks together, and a
  pair of scamps; remember our escapades, and be a little bit young
  again, my old friend, in your dealings with him. The sixty
  thousand francs will be remitted to you in the shape of a bill on
  the Treasury by a gentlemen who is going to Paris," and so forth.

If the old couple to whom this epistle was addressed had followed out Chesnel's instructions,
they would have been compelled to take three private detectives into their pay. And yet there
was ample wisdom shown in Chesnel's choice of a depositary. A banker pays money to any one
accredited to him so long as the money lasts; whereas, Victurnien was obliged, every time that
he was in want of money, to make a personal visit to the notary, who was quite sure to use
the right of remonstrance.

Victurnien heard that he was to be allowed two thousand francs every month, and thought that
he betrayed his joy. He knew nothing of Paris. He fancied that he could keep up princely state
on such a sum.

Next day he started on his journey. All the benedictions of the Collection of Antiquities went
with him; he was kissed by the dowagers; good wishes were heaped on his head; his old father,
his aunt, and Chesnel went with him out of the town, tears filling the eyes of all three. The
sudden departure supplied material for conversation for several evenings; and what was more,
it stirred the rancorous minds of the salon du Croisier to the depths. The forage-contractor,
the president, and others who had vowed to ruin the d'Esgrignons, saw their prey escaping out
of their hands. They had based their schemes of revenge on a young man's follies, and now he
was beyond their reach.

The tendency in human nature, which often gives a bigot a rake for a daughter, and makes a
frivolous woman the mother of a narrow pietist; that rule of contraries, which, in all probability,
is the "resultant" of the law of similarities, drew Victurnien to Paris by a desire to which
he must sooner or later have yielded. Brought up as he had been in the old-fashioned provincial
house, among the quiet, gentle faces that smiled upon him, among sober servants attached to
the family, and surroundings tinged with a general color of age, the boy had only seen friends
worthy of respect. All of those about him, with the exception of the Chevalier, had example
of venerable age, were elderly men and women, sedate of manner, decorous and sententious of
speech. He had been petted by those women in gray gowns and embroidered mittens described by
Blondet. The antiquated splendors of his father's house were as little calculated as possible
to suggest frivolous thoughts; and lastly, he had been educated by a sincerely religious abbe,
possessed of all the charm of old age, which has dwelt in two centuries, and brings to the
Present its gifts of the dried roses of experience, the faded flowers of the old customs of
its youth. Everything should have combined to fashion Victurnien to serious habits; his whole
surroundings from childhood bade him continue the glory of a historic name, by taking his life
as something noble and great; and yet Victurnien listened to dangerous promptings.

For him, his noble birth was a stepping-stone which raised him above other men. He felt that
the idol of Noblesse, before which they burned incense at home, was hollow; he had come to
be one of the commonest as well as one of the worst types from a social point of view--a consistent
egoist. The aristocratic cult of the ego simply taught him to follow his own fancies; he had
been idolized by those who had the care of him in childhood, and adored by the companions who
shared in his boyish escapades, and so he had formed a habit of looking and judging everything
as it affected his own pleasure; he took it as a matter of course when good souls saved him
from the consequences of his follies, a piece of mistaken kindness which could only lead to
his ruin. Victurnien's early training, noble and pious though it was, had isolated him too
much. He was out of the current of the life of the time, for the life of a provincial town
is certainly not in the main current of the age; Victurnien's true destiny lifted him above
it. He had learned to think of an action, not as it affected others, nor relatively, but absolutely
from his own point of view. Like despots, he made the law to suit the circumstance, a system
which works in the lives of prodigal sons the same confusion which fancy brings into art.

Victurnien was quick-sighted, he saw clearly and without illusion, but he acted on impulse,
and unwisely. An indefinable flaw of character, often seen in young men, but impossible to
explain, led him to will one thing and do another. In spite of an active mind, which showed
itself in unexpected ways, the senses had but to assert themselves, and the darkened brain
seemed to exist no longer. He might have astonished wise men; he was capable of setting fools
agape. His desires, like a sudden squall of bad weather, overclouded all the clear and lucid
spaces of his brain in a moment; and then, after the dissipations which he could not resist,
he sank, utterly exhausted in body, heart, and mind, into a collapsed condition bordering upon
imbecility. Such a character will drag a man down into the mire if he is left to himself, or
bring him to the highest heights of political power if he has some stern friend to keep him
in hand. Neither Chesnel, nor the lad's father, nor Aunt Armande had fathomed the depths of
a nature so nearly akin on many sides to the poetic temperament, yet smitten with a terrible
weakness at its core.

By the time the old town lay several miles away, Victurnien felt not the slightest regret;
he thought no more about the father, who had loved ten generations in his son, nor of the aunt,
and her almost insane devotion. He was looking forward to Paris with vehement ill-starred longings;
in thought he had lived in that fairyland, it had been the background of his brightest dreams.
He imagined that he would be first in Paris, as he had been in the town and the department
where his father's name was potent; but it was vanity, not pride, that filled his soul, and
in his dreams his pleasures were to be magnified by all the greatness of Paris. The distance
was soon crossed. The traveling coach, like his own thoughts, left the narrow horizon of the
province for the vast world of the great city, without a break in the journey. He stayed in
the Rue de Richelieu, in a handsome hotel close to the boulevard, and hastened to take possession
of Paris as a famished horse rushes into a meadow.

He was not long in finding out the difference between country and town, and was rather surprised
than abashed by the change. His mental quickness soon discovered how small an entity he was
in the midst of this all-comprehending Babylon; how insane it would be to attempt to stem the
torrent of new ideas and new ways. A single incident was enough. He delivered his father's
letter of introduction to the Duc de Lenoncourt, a noble who stood high in favor with the King.
He saw the duke in his splendid mansion, among surroundings befitting his rank. Next day he
met him again. This time the Peer of France was lounging on foot along the boulevard, just
like any ordinary mortal, with an umbrella in his hand; he did not even wear the Blue Ribbon,
without which no knight of the order could have appeared in public in other times. And, duke
and peer and first gentleman of the bedchamber though he was, M. de Lenoncourt, in spite of
his high courtesy, could not repress a smile as he read his relative's letter; and that smile
told Victurnien that the Collection of Antiquities and the Tuileries were separated by more
than sixty leagues of road; the distance of several centuries lay between them.

The names of the families grouped about the throne are quite different in each successive reign,
and the characters change with the names. It would seem that, in the sphere of court, the same
thing happens over and over again in each generation; but each time there is a quite different
set of personages. If history did not prove that this is so, it would seem incredible. The
prominent men at the court of Louis XVIII., for instance, had scarcely any connection with
the Rivieres, Blacas, d'Avarays, Vitrolles, d'Autichamps, Pasquiers, Larochejaqueleins, Decazes,
Dambrays, Laines, de Villeles, La Bourdonnayes, and others who shone at the court of Louis
XV. Compare the courtiers of Henri IV. with those of Louis XIV.; you will hardly find five
great families of the former time still in existence. The nephew of the great Richelieu was
a very insignificant person at the court of Louis XIV.; while His Majesty's favorite, Villeroi,
was the grandson of a secretary ennobled by Charles IX. And so it befell that the d'Esgrignons,
all but princes under the Valois, and all-powerful in the time of Henri IV., had no fortune
whatever at the court of Louis XVIII., which gave them not so much as a thought. At this day
there are names as famous as those of royal houses--the Foix-Graillys, for instance, or the
d'Herouvilles--left to obscurity tantamount to extinction for want of money, the one power
of the time.

All which things Victurnien beheld entirely from his own point of view; he felt the equality
that he saw in Paris as a personal wrong. The monster Equality was swallowing down the last
fragments of social distinction in the Restoration. Having made up his mind on this head, he
immediately proceeded to try to win back his place with such dangerous, if blunted weapons,
as the age left to the noblesse. It is an expensive matter to gain the attention of Paris.
To this end, Victurnien adopted some of the ways then in vogue. He felt that it was a necessity
to have horses and fine carriages, and all the accessories of modern luxury; he felt, in short,
"that a man must keep abreast of the times," as de Marsay said--de Marsay, the first dandy
that he came across in the first drawing-room to which he was introduced. For his misfortune,
he fell in with a set of roues, with de Marsay, de Ronquerolles, Maxime de Trailles, des Lupeaulx,
Rastignac, Ajuda-Pinto, Beaudenord, de la Roche-Hugon, de Manerville, and the Vandenesses,
whom he met wherever he went, and a great many houses were open to a young man with his ancient
name and reputation for wealth. The Faubourg Saint-Germain has its provincial genealogies at
its fingers' ends; a great name once recognized and adopted therein is a passport which opens
many a door that will scarcely turn on its hinges for unknown names or the lions of a lower rank.

Victurnien found his relatives both amiable and ready to welcome him so long as he did not
appear as a suppliant; he saw at once that the surest way of obtaining nothing was to ask for
something. At Paris, if the first impulse moves people to protect, second thoughts (which last
a good deal longer) impel them to despise the protege. Independence, vanity, and pride, all
the young Count's better and worse feelings combined, led him, on the contrary, to assume an
aggressive attitude. And therefore the Ducs de Verneuil, de Lenoncourt, de Chaulieu, de Navarreins,
d'Herouville, de Grandlieu, and de Maufrigneuse, the Princes de Cadignan and de Blamont-Chauvry,
were delighted to present the charming survivor of the wreck of an ancient family at court.

Victurnien went to the Tuileries in a splendid carriage with his armorial bearings on the panels;
but his presentation to His Majesty made it abundantly clear to him that the people occupied
the royal mind so much that his nobility was like to be forgotten. The restored dynasty, moreover,
was surrounded by triple ranks of eligible old men and gray-headed courtiers; the young noblesse
was reduced to a cipher, and this Victurnien guessed at once. He saw that there was no suitable
place for him at court, nor in the government, nor the army, nor, indeed, anywhere else. So
he launched out into the world of pleasure. Introduced at the Elyess-Bourbon, at the Duchesse
d'Angouleme's, at the Pavillon Marsan, he met on all sides with the surface civilities due
to the heir of an old family, not so old but it could be called to mind by the sight of a living
member. And, after all, it was not a small thing to be remembered. In the distinction with
which Victurnien was honored lay the way to the peerage and a splendid marriage; he had taken
the field with a false appearance of wealth, and his vanity would not allow him to declare
his real position. Besides, he had been so much complimented on the figure that he made, he
was so pleased with his first success, that, like many other young men, he felt ashamed to
draw back. He took a suite of rooms in the Rue du Bac, with stables and a complete equipment
for the fashionable life to which he had committed himself. These preliminaries cost him fifty
thousand francs, which money, moreover, the young gentleman managed to draw in spite of all
Chesnel's wise precautions, thanks to a series of unforeseen events.

Chesnel's letter certainly reached his friend's office, but Maitre Sorbier was dead; and Mme.
Sorbier, a matter-of-fact person, seeing it was a business letter, handed it on to her husband's
successor. Maitre Cardot, the new notary, informed the young Count that a draft on the Treasury
made payable to the deceased would be useless; and by way of reply to the letter, which had
cost the old provincial notary so much thought, Cardot despatched four lines intended not to
reach Chesnel's heart, but to produce the money. Chesnel made the draft payable to Sorbier's
young successor; and the latter, feeling but little inclination to adopt his correspondent's
sentimentality, was delighted to put himself at the Count's orders, and gave Victurnien as
much money as he wanted.

Now those who know what life in Paris means, know that fifty thousand francs will not go very
far in furniture, horses, carriages, and elegance generally; but it must be borne in mind that
Victurnien immediately contracted some twenty thousand francs' worth of debts besides, and
his tradespeople at first were not at all anxious to be paid, for our young gentleman's fortune
had been prodigiously increased, partly by rumor, partly by Josephin, that Chesnel in livery.

Victurnien had not been in town a month before he was obliged to repair to his man of business
for ten thousand francs; he had only been playing whist with the Ducs de Navarreins, de Chaulieu,
and de Lenoncourt, and now and again at his club. He had begun by winning some thousands of
francs but pretty soon lost five or six thousand, which brought home to him the necessity of
a purse for play. Victurnien had the spirit that gains goodwill everywhere, and puts a young
man of a great family on a level with the very highest. He was not merely admitted at once
into the band of patrician youth, but was even envied by the rest. It was intoxicating to him
to feel that he was envied, nor was he in this mood very likely to think of reform. Indeed,
he had completely lost his head. He would not think of the means; he dipped into his money-bags
as if they could be refilled indefinitely; he deliberately shut his eyes to the inevitable
results of the system. In that dissipated set, in the continual whirl of gaiety, people take
the actors in their brilliant costumes as they find them, no one inquires whether a man can
afford to make the figure he does, there is nothing in worse taste than inquiries as to ways
and means. A man ought to renew his wealth perpetually, and as Nature does--below the surface
and out of sight. People talk if somebody comes to grief; they joke about a newcomer's fortune
till their minds are set at rest, and at this they draw the line. Victurnien d'Esgrignon, with
all the Faubourg Saint-Germain to back him, with all his protectors exaggerating the amount
of his fortune (were it only to rid themselves of responsibility), and magnifying his possessions
in the most refined and well-bred way, with a hint or a word; with all these advantages--to
repeat--Victurnien was, in fact, an eligible Count. He was handsome, witty, sound in politics;
his father still possessed the ancestral castle and the lands of the marquisate. Such a young
fellow is sure of an admirable reception in houses where there are marriageable daughters,
fair but portionless partners at dances, and young married women who find that time hangs heavy
on their hands. So the world, smiling, beckoned him to the foremost benches in its booth; the
seats reserved for marquises are still in the same place in Paris; and if the names are changed,
the things are the same as ever.

In the most exclusive circle of society in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Victurnien found the
Chevalier's double in the person of the Vidame de Pamiers. The Vidame was a Chevalier de Valois
raised to the tenth power, invested with all the prestige of wealth, enjoying all the advantages
of high position. The dear Vidame was a repositary for everybody's secrets, and the gazette
of the Faubourg besides; nevertheless, he was discreet, and, like other gazettes, only said
things that might safely be published. Again Victurnien listened to the Chevalier's esoteric
doctrines. The Vidame told young d'Esgrignon, without mincing matters, to make conquests among
women of quality, supplementing the advice with anecdotes from his own experience. The Vicomte
de Pamiers, it seemed, had permitted himself much that it would serve no purpose to relate
here; so remote was it all from our modern manners, in which soul and passion play so large
a part, that nobody would believe it. But the excellent Vidame did more than this.

"Dine with me at a tavern to-morrow," said he, by way of conclusion. "We will digest our dinner
at the Opera, and afterwards I will take you to a house where several people have the greatest
wish to meet you."

The Vidame gave a delightful little dinner at the Rocher de Cancale; three guests only were
asked to meet Victurnien--de Marsay, Rastignac, and Blondet. Emile Blondet, the young Count's
fellow-townsman, was a man of letters on the outskirts of society to which he had been introduced
by a charming woman from the same province. This was one of the Vicomte de Troisville's daughters,
now married to the Comte de Montcornet, one of those of Napoleon's generals who went over to
the Bourbons. The Vidame held that a dinner-party of more than six persons was beneath contempt.
In that case, according to him, there was an end alike of cookery and conversation, and a man
could not sip his wine in a proper frame of mind.

"I have not yet told you, my dear boy, where I mean to take you to-night," he said, taking
Victurnien's hands and tapping on them. "You are going to see Mlle. des Touches; all the pretty
women with any pretensions to wit will be at her house en petit comite. Literature, art, poetry,
any sort of genius, in short, is held in great esteem there. It is one of our old-world bureaux
d'esprit, with a veneer of monarchical doctrine, the livery of this present age."

"It is sometimes as tiresome and tedious there as a pair of new boots, but there are women
with whom you cannot meet anywhere else," said de Marsay.

"If all the poets who went there to rub up their muse were like our friend here," said Rastignac,
tapping Blondet familiarly on the shoulder, "we should have some fun. But a plague of odes,
and ballads, and driveling meditations, and novels with wide margins, pervades the sofas and
the atmosphere."

"I don't dislike them," said de Marsay, "so long as they corrupt girls' minds, and don't spoil
women."

"Gentlemen," smiled Blondet, "you are encroaching on my field of literature."

"You need not talk. You have robbed us of the most charming woman in the world, you lucky rogue;
we may be allowed to steal your less brilliant ideas," cried Rastignac.

"Yes, he is a lucky rascal," said the Vidame, and he twitched Blondet's ear. "But perhaps Victurnien
here will be luckier still this evening----"

"Already!" exclaimed de Marsay. "Why, he only came here a month ago; he has scarcely had time
to shake the dust of his old manor house off his feet, to wipe off the brine in which his aunt
kept him preserved; he has only just set up a decent horse, a tilbury in the latest style,
a groom----"

"No, no, not a groom," interrupted Rastignac; "he has some sort of an agricultural laborer
that he brought with him 'from his place.' Buisson, who understands a livery as well as most,
declared that the man was physically incapable of wearing a jacket."

"I will tell you what, you ought to have modeled yourself on Beaudenord," the Vidame said seriously.
"He has this advantage over all of you, my young friends, he has a genuine specimen of the
English tiger----"

"Just see, gentlemen, what the noblesse have come to in France!" cried Victurnien. "For them
the one important thing is to have a tiger, a thoroughbred, and baubles----"

"Bless me!" said Blondet. "'This gentleman's good sense at times appalls me.'--Well, yes, young
moralist, you nobles have come to that. You have not even left to you that lustre of lavish
expenditure for which the dear Vidame was famous fifty years ago. We revel on a second floor
in the Rue Montorgueil. There are no more wars with the Cardinal, no Field of the Cloth of
Gold. You, Comte d'Esgrignon, in short, are supping in the company of one Blondet, younger
son of a miserable provincial magistrate, with whom you would not shake hands down yonder;
and in ten years' time you may sit beside him among peers of the realm. Believe in yourself
after that, if you can."

"Ah, well," said Rastignac, "we have passed from action to thought, from brute force to force
of intellect, we are talking----"

"Let us not talk of our reverses," protested the Vidame; "I have made up my mind to die merrily.
If our friend here has not a tiger as yet, he comes of a race of lions, and can dispense with one."

"He cannot do without a tiger," said Blondet; "he is too newly come to town."

"His elegance may be new as yet," returned de Marsay, "but we are adopting it. He is worthy
of us, he understands his age, he has brains, he is nobly born and gently bred; we are going
to like him, and serve him, and push him----"

"Whither?" inquired Blondet.

"Inquisitive soul!" said Rastignac.

"With whom will he take up to-night?" de Marsay asked.

"With a whole seraglio," said the Vidame.

"Plague take it! What can we have done that the dear Vidame is punishing us by keeping his
word to the infanta? I should be pitiable indeed if I did not know her----"

"And I was once a coxcomb even as he," said the Vidame, indicating de Marsay.

The conversation continued pitched in the same key, charmingly scandalous, and agreeably corrupt.
The dinner went off very pleasantly. Rastignac and de Marsay went to the Opera with the Vidame
and Victurnien, with a view to following them afterwards to Mlle. des Touches' salon. And thither,
accordingly, this pair of rakes betook themselves, calculating that by that time the tragedy
would have been read; for of all things to be taken between eleven and twelve o'clock at night,
a tragedy in their opinion was the most unwholesome. They went to keep a watch on Victurnien
and to embarrass him, a piece of schoolboys's mischief embittered by a jealous dandy's spite.
But Victurnien was gifted with that page's effrontery which is a great help to ease of manner;
and Rastignac, watching him as he made his entrance, was surprised to see how quickly he caught
the tone of the moment.

"That young d'Esgrignon will go far, will he not?" he said, addressing his companion.

"That is as may be," returned de Marsay, "but he is in a fair way."

The Vidame introduced his young friend to one of the most amiable and frivolous duchesses of
the day, a lady whose adventures caused an explosion five years later. Just then, however,
she was in the full blaze of her glory; she had been suspected, it is true, of equivocal conduct;
but suspicion, while it is still suspicion and not proof, marks a woman out with the kind of
distinction which slander gives to a man. Nonentities are never slandered; they chafe because
they are left in peace. This woman was, in fact, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, a daughter of
the d'Uxelles; her father-in-law was still alive; she was not to be the Princesse de Cadignan
for some years to come. A friend of the Duchesse de Langeais and the Vicomtesse de Beauseant,
two glories departed, she was likewise intimate with the Marquise d'Espard, with whom she disputed
her fragile sovereignty as queen of fashion. Great relations lent her countenance for a long
while, but the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse was one of those women who, in some way, nobody knows
how, or why, or where, will spend the rents of all the lands of earth, and of the moon likewise,
if they were not out of reach. The general outline of her character was scarcely known as yet;
de Marsay, and de Marsay only, really had read her. That redoubtable dandy now watched the
Vidame de Pamiers' introduction of his young friend to that lovely woman, and bent over to
say in Rastignac's ear:

"My dear fellow, he will go up whizz! like a rocket, and come down like a stick," an atrociously
vulgar saying which was remarkably fulfilled.

The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse had lost her heart to Victurnien after first giving her mind to
a serious study of him. Any lover who should have caught the glance by which she expressed
her gratitude to the Vidame might well have been jealous of such friendship. Women are like
horses let loose on a steppe when they feel, as the Duchess felt with the Vidame de Pamiers,
that the ground is safe; at such moments they are themselves; perhaps it pleases them to give,
as it were, samples of their tenderness in intimacy in this way. It was a guarded glance, nothing
was lost between eye and eye; there was no possibility of reflection in any mirror. Nobody
intercepted it.

"See how she has prepared herself," Rastignac said, turning to de Marsay. "What a virginal
toilette; what swan's grace in that snow-white throat of hers! How white her gown is, and she
is wearing a sash like a little girl; she looks round like a madonna inviolate. Who would think
that you had passed that way?"

"The very reason why she looks as she does," returned de Marsay, with a triumphant air.

The two young men exchanged a smile. Mme. de Maufrigneuse saw the smile and guessed at their
conversation, and gave the pair a broadside of her eyes, an art acquired by Frenchwomen since
the Peace, when Englishwomen imported it into this country, together with the shape of their
silver plate, their horses and harness, and the piles of insular ice which impart a refreshing
coolness to the atmosphere of any room in which a certain number of British females are gathered
together. The young men grew serious as a couple of clerks at the end of a homily from headquarters
before the receipt of an expected bonus.

The Duchess when she lost her heart to Victurnien had made up her mind to play the part of
romantic Innocence, a role much understudied subsequently by other women, for the misfortune
of modern youth. Her Grace of Maufrigneuse had just come out as an angel at a moment's notice,
precisely as she meant to turn to literature and science somewhere about her fortieth year
instead of taking to devotion. She made a point of being like nobody else. Her parts, her dresses,
her caps, opinions, toilettes, and manner of acting were all entirely new and original. Soon
after her marriage, when she was scarcely more than a girl, she had played the part of a knowing
and almost depraved woman; she ventured on risky repartees with shallow people, and betrayed
her ignorance to those who knew better. As the date of that marriage made it impossible to
abstract one little year from her age without the knowledge of Time, she had taken it into
her head to be immaculate. She scarcely seemed to belong to earth; she shook out her wide sleeves
as if they had been wings. Her eyes fled to heaven at too warm a glance, or word, or thought.

There is a madonna painted by Piola, the great Genoese painter, who bade fair to bring out
a second edition of Raphael till his career was cut short by jealousy and murder; his madonna,
however, you may dimly discern through a pane of glass in a little street in Genoa.

A more chaste-eyed madonna than Piola's does not exist but compared with Mme. de Maufrigneuse,
that heavenly creature was a Messalina. Women wondered among themselves how such a giddy young
thing had been transformed by a change of dress into the fair veiled seraph who seemed (to
use an expression now in vogue) to have a soul as white as new fallen snow on the highest Alpine
crests. How had she solved in such short space the Jesuitical problem how to display a bosom
whiter than her soul by hiding it in gauze? How could she look so ethereal while her eyes drooped
so murderously? Those almost wanton glances seemed to give promise of untold languorous delight,
while by an ascetic's sigh of aspiration after a better life the mouth appeared to add that
none of those promises would be fulfilled. Ingenuous youths (for there were a few to be found
in the Guards of that day) privately wondered whether, in the most intimate moments, it were
possible to speak familiarly to this White Lady, this starry vapor slidden down from the Milky
Way. This system, which answered completely for some years at a stretch, was turned to good
account by women of fashion, whose breasts were lined with a stout philosophy, for they could
cloak no inconsiderable exactions with these little airs from the sacristy. Not one of the
celestial creatures but was quite well aware of the possibilities of less ethereal love which
lay in the longing of every well-conditioned male to recall such beings to earth. It was a
fashion which permitted them to abide in a semi-religious, semi-Ossianic empyrean; they could,
and did, ignore all the practical details of daily life, a short and easy method of disposing
of many questions. De Marsay, foreseeing the future developments of the system, added a last
word, for he saw that Rastignac was jealous of Victurnien.

"My boy," said he, "stay as you are. Our Nucingen will make your fortune, whereas the Duchess
would ruin you. She is too expensive."

Rastignac allowed de Marsay to go without asking further questions. He knew Paris. He knew
that the most refined and noble and disinterested of women--a woman who cannot be induced to
accept anything but a bouquet--can be as dangerous an acquaintance for a young man as any opera
girl of former days. As a matter of fact, the opera girl is an almost mythical being. As things
are now at the theatres, dancers and actresses are about as amusing as a declaration of the
rights of woman, they are puppets that go abroad in the morning in the character of respected
and respectable mothers of families, and act men's parts in tight-fitting garments at night.

Worthy M. Chesnel, in his country notary's office, was right; he had foreseen one of the reefs
on which the Count might shipwreck. Victurnien was dazzled by the poetic aureole which Mme.
de Maufrigneuse chose to assume; he was chained and padlocked from the first hour in her company,
bound captive by that girlish sash, and caught by the curls twined round fairy fingers. Far
corrupted the boy was already, but he really believed in that farrago of maidenliness and muslin,
in sweet looks as much studied as an Act of Parliament. And if the one man, who is in duty
bound to believe in feminine fibs, is deceived by them, is not that enough?

For a pair of lovers, the rest of their species are about as much alive as figures on the tapestry.
The Duchess, flattery apart, was avowedly and admittedly one of the ten handsomest women in
society. "The loveliest woman in Paris" is, as you know, as often met with in the world of
love-making as "the finest book that has appeared in this generation," in the world of letters.

The converse which Victurnien held with the Duchess can be kept up at his age without too great
a strain. He was young enough and ignorant enough of life in Paris to feel no necessity to
be upon his guard, no need to keep a watch over his lightest words and glances. The religious
sentimentalism, which finds a broadly humorous commentary in the after-thoughts of either speaker,
puts the old-world French chat of men and women, with its pleasant familiarity, its lively
ease, quite out of the question; they make love in a mist nowadays.

Victurnien was just sufficient of an unsophisticated provincial to remain suspended in a highly
appropriate and unfeigned rapture which pleased the Duchess; for women are no more to be deceived
by the comedies which men play than by their own. Mme. de Maufrigneuse calculated, not without
dismay, that the young Count's infatuation was likely to hold good for six whole months of
disinterested love. She looked so lovely in this dove's mood, quenching the light in her eyes
by the golden fringe of their lashes, that when the Marquise d'Espard bade her friend good-night,
she whispered, "Good! very good, dear!" And with those farewell words, the fair Marquise left
her rival to make the tour of the modern Pays du Tendre; which, by the way, is not so absurd
a conception as some appear to think. New maps of the country are engraved for each generation;
and if the names of the routes are different, they still lead to the same capital city.

In the course of an hour's tete-a-tete, on a corner sofa, under the eyes of the world, the
Duchess brought young d'Esgrignon as far as Scipio's Generosity, the Devotion of Amadis, and
Chivalrous Self-abnegation (for the Middle Ages were just coming into fashion, with their daggers,
machicolations, hauberks, chain-mail, peaked shoes, and romantic painted card-board properties).
She had an admirable turn, moreover, for leaving things unsaid, for leaving ideas in a discreet,
seeming careless way, to work their way down, one by one, into Victurnien's heart, like needles
into a cushion. She possessed a marvelous skill in reticence; she was charming in hypocrisy,
lavish of subtle promises, which revived hope and then melted away like ice in the sun if you
looked at them closely, and most treacherous in the desire which she felt and inspired. At
the close of this charming encounter she produced the running noose of an invitation to call,
and flung it over him with a dainty demureness which the printed page can never set forth.

"You will forget me," she said. "You will find so many women eager to pay court to you instead
of enlightening you.... But you will come back to me undeceived. Are you coming to me first?...
No. As you will.--For my own part, I tell you frankly that your visits will be a great pleasure
to me. People of soul are so rare, and I think that you are one of them.--Come, good-bye; people
will begin to talk about us if we talk together any longer."

She made good her words and took flight. Victurnien went soon afterwards, but not before others
had guessed his ecstatic condition; his face wore the expression peculiar to happy men, something
between an Inquisitor's calm discretion and the self-contained beatitude of a devotee, fresh
from the confessional and absolution.

"Mme. de Maufrigneuse went pretty briskly to the point this evening," said the Duchesse de
Grandlieu, when only half-a-dozen persons were left in Mlle. des Touches' little drawing-room--to
wit, des Lupeaulx, a Master of Requests, who at that time stood very well at court, Vandenesse,
the Vicomtesse de Grandlieu, Canalis, and Mme. de Serizy.

"D'Esgrignon and Maufrigneuse are two names that are sure to cling together," said Mme. de
Serizy, who aspired to epigram.

"For some days past she has been out at grass on Platonism," said des Lupeaulx.

"She will ruin that poor innocent," added Charles de Vandenesse.

"What do you mean?" asked Mlle. des Touches.

"Oh, morally and financially, beyond all doubt," said the Vicomtesse, rising.

The cruel words were cruelly true for young d'Esgrignon.

Next morning he wrote to his aunt describing his introduction into the high world of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain in bright colors flung by the prism of love, explaining the reception which met
him everywhere in a way which gratified his father's family pride. The Marquis would have the
whole long letter read to him twice; he rubbed his hands when he heard of the Vidame de Pamiers'
dinner--the Vidame was an old acquaintance--and of the subsequent introduction to the Duchess;
but at Blondet's name he lost himself in conjectures. What could the younger son of a judge,
a public prosecutor during the Revolution, have been doing there?

There was joy that evening among the Collection of Antiquities. They talked over the young
Count's success. So discreet were they with regard to Mme. de Maufrigneuse, that the one man
who heard the secret was the Chevalier. There was no financial postscript at the end of the
letter, no unpleasant reference to the sinews of war, which every young man makes in such a
case. Mlle. Armande showed it to Chesnel. Chesnel was pleased and raised not a single objection.
It was clear, as the Marquis and the Chevalier agreed, that a young man in favor with the Duchesse
de Maufrigneuse would shortly be a hero at court, where in the old days women were all-powerful.
The Count had not made a bad choice. The dowagers told over all the gallant adventures of the
Maufrigneuses from Louis XIII. to Louis XVI.--they spared to inquire into preceding reigns--and
when all was done they were enchanted.--Mme. de Maufrigneuse was much praised for interesting
herself in Victurnien. Any writer of plays in search of a piece of pure comedy would have found
it well worth his while to listen to the Antiquities in conclave.

Victurnien received charming letters from his father and aunt, and also from the Chevalier.
That gentleman recalled himself to the Vidame's memory. He had been at Spa with M. de Pamiers
in 1778, after a certain journey made by a celebrated Hungarian princess. And Chesnel also
wrote. The fond flattery to which the unhappy boy was only too well accustomed shone out of
every page; and Mlle. Armande seemed to share half of Mme. de Maufrigneuse's happiness.

Thus happy in the approval of his family, the young Count made a spirited beginning in the
perilous and costly ways of dandyism. He had five horses--he was moderate--de Marsay had fourteen!
He returned the Vidame's hospitality, even including Blondet in the invitation, as well as
de Marsay and Rastignac. The dinner cost five hundred francs, and the noble provincial was
feted on the same scale. Victurnien played a good deal, and, for his misfortune, at the fashionable
game of whist.

He laid out his days in busy idleness. Every day between twelve and three o'clock he was with
the Duchess; afterwards he went to meet her in the Bois de Boulogne and ride beside her carriage.
Sometimes the charming couple rode together, but this was early in fine summer mornings. Society,
balls, the theatre, and gaiety filled the Count's evening hours. Everywhere Victurnien made
a brilliant figure, everywhere he flung the pearls of his wit broadcast. He gave his opinion
on men, affairs, and events in profound sayings; he would have put you in mind of a fruit-tree
putting forth all its strength in blossom. He was leading an enervating life wasteful of money,
and even yet more wasteful, it may be of a man's soul; in that life the fairest talents are
buried out of sight, the most incorruptible honesty perishes, the best-tempered springs of
will are slackened.

The Duchess, so white and fragile and angel-like, felt attracted to the dissipations of bachelor
life; she enjoyed first nights, she liked anything amusing, anything improvised. Bohemian restaurants
lay outside her experience; so d'Esgrignon got up a charming little party at the Rocher de
Cancale for her benefit, asked all the amiable scamps whom she cultivated and sermonized, and
there was a vast amount of merriment, wit, and gaiety, and a corresponding bill to pay. That
supper led to others. And through it all Victurnien worshiped her as an angel. Mme. de Maufrigneuse
for him was still an angel, untouched by any taint of earth; an angel at the Varietes, where
she sat out the half-obscene, vulgar farces, which made her laugh; an angel through the cross-fire
of highly-flavored jests and scandalous anecdotes, which enlivened a stolen frolic; a languishing
angel in the latticed box at the Vaudeville; an angel while she criticised the postures of
opera dancers with the experience of an elderly habitue of le coin de la reine; an angel at
the Porte Saint-Martin, at the little boulevard theatres, at the masked balls, which she enjoyed
like any schoolboy. She was an angel who asked him for the love that lives by self-abnegation
and heroism and self-sacrifice; an angel who would have her lover live like an English lord,
with an income of a million francs. D'Esgrignon once exchanged a horse because the animal's
coat did not satisfy her notions. At play she was an angel, and certainly no bourgeoise that
ever lived could have bidden d'Esgrignon "Stake for me!" in such an angelic way. She was so
divinely reckless in her folly, that a man might well have sold his soul to the devil lest
this angel should lose her taste for earthly pleasures.

The first winter went by. The Count had drawn on M. Cardot for the trifling sum of thirty thousand
francs over and above Chesnel's remittance. As Cardot very carefully refrained from using his
right of remonstrance, Victurnien now learned for the first time that he had overdrawn his
account. He was the more offended by an extremely polite refusal to make any further advance,
since it so happened that he had just lost six thousand francs at play at the club, and he
could not very well show himself there until they were paid.

After growing indignant with Maitre Cardot, who had trusted him with thirty thousand francs
(Cardot had written to Chesnel, but to the fair Duchess' favorite he made the most of his so-called
confidence in him), after all this, d'Esgrignon was obliged to ask the lawyer to tell him how
to set about raising the money, since debts of honor were in question.

"Draw bills on your father's banker, and take them to his correspondent; he, no doubt, will
discount them for you. Then write to your family, and tell them to remit the amount to the banker."

An inner voice seemed to suggest du Croisier's name in this predicament. He had seen du Croisier
on his knees to the aristocracy, and of the man's real disposition he was entirely ignorant.
So to du Croisier he wrote a very offhand letter, informing him that he had drawn a bill of
exchange on him for ten thousand francs, adding that the amount would be repaid on receipt
of the letter either by M. Chesnel or by Mlle. Armande d'Esgrignon. Then he indited two touching
epistles--one to Chesnel, another to his aunt. In the matter of going headlong to ruin, a young
man often shows singular ingenuity and ability, and fortune favors him. In the morning Victurnien
happened on the name of the Paris bankers in correspondence with du Croisier, and de Marsay
furnished him with the Kellers' address. De Marsay knew everything in Paris. The Kellers took
the bill and gave him the sum without a word, after deducting the discount. The balance of
the account was in du Croisier's favor.

But the gaming debt was as nothing in comparison with the state of things at home. Invoices
showered in upon Victurnien.

"I say! Do you trouble yourself about that sort of thing?" Rastignac said, laughing. "Are you
putting them in order, my dear boy? I did not think you were so business-like."

"My dear fellow, it is quite time I thought about it; there are twenty odd thousand francs there."

De Marsay, coming in to look up d'Esgrignon for a steeplechase, produced a dainty little pocket-book,
took out twenty thousand francs, and handed them to him.

"It is the best way of keeping the money safe," said he; "I am twice enchanted to have won
it yesterday from my honored father, Milord Dudley."

Such French grace completely fascinated d'Esgrignon; he took it for friendship; and as to the
money, punctually forgot to pay his debts with it, and spent it on his pleasures. The fact
was that de Marsay was looking on with an unspeakable pleasure while young d'Esgrignon "got
out of his depth," in dandy's idiom; it pleased de Marsay in all sorts of fondling ways to
lay an arm on the lad's shoulder; by and by he should feel its weight, and disappear the sooner.
For de Marsay was jealous; the Duchess flaunted her love affair; she was not at home to other
visitors when d'Esgrignon was with her. And besides, de Marsay was one of those savage humorists
who delight in mischief, as Turkish women in the bath. So when he had carried off the prize,
and bets were settled at the tavern where they breakfasted, and a bottle or two of good wine
had appeared, de Marsay turned to d'Esgrignon with a laugh:

"Those bills that you are worrying over are not yours, I am sure."

"Eh! if they weren't, why should he worry himself?" asked Rastignac.

"And whose should they be?" d'Esgrignon inquired.

"Then you do not know the Duchess' position?" queried de Marsay, as he sprang into the saddle.

"No," said d'Esgrignon, his curiosity aroused.

"Well, dear fellow, it is like this," returned de Marsay--"thirty thousand francs to Victorine,
eighteen thousand francs to Houbigaut, lesser amounts to Herbault, Nattier, Nourtier, and those
Latour people,--altogether a hundred thousand francs."

"An angel!" cried d'Esgrignon, with eyes uplifted to heaven.

"This is the bill for her wings," Rastignac cried facetiously.

"She owes all that, my dear boy," continued de Marsay, "precisely because she is an angel.
But we have all seen angels in this position," he added, glancing at Rastignac; "there is this
about women that is sublime: they understand nothing of money; they do not meddle with it,
it is no affair of theirs; they are invited guests at the 'banquet of life,' as some poet or
other said that came to an end in the workhouse."

"How do you know this when I do not?" d'Esgrignon artlessly returned.

"You are sure to be the last to know it, just as she is sure to be the last to hear that you
are in debt."

"I thought she had a hundred thousand livres a year," said d'Esgrignon.

"Her husband," replied de Marsay, "lives apart from her. He stays with his regiment and practises
economy, for he has one or two little debts of his own as well, has our dear Duke. Where do
you come from? Just learn to do as we do and keep our friends' accounts for them. Mlle. Diane
(I fell in love with her for the name's sake), Mlle. Diane d'Uxelles brought her husband sixty
thousand livres of income; for the last eight years she has lived as if she had two hundred
thousand. It is perfectly plain that at this moment her lands are mortgaged up to their full
value; some fine morning the crash must come, and the angel will be put to flight by--must
it be said?--by sheriff's officers that have the effrontery to lay hands on an angel just as
they might take hold of one of us."

"Poor angel!"

"Lord! it costs a great deal to dwell in a Parisian heaven; you must whiten your wings and
your complexion every morning," said Rastignac.

Now as the thought of confessing his debts to his beloved Diane had passed through d'Esgrignon's
mind, something like a shudder ran through him when he remembered that he still owed sixty
thousand francs, to say nothing of bills to come for another ten thousand. He went back melancholy
enough. His friends remarked his ill-disguised preoccupation, and spoke of it among themselves
at dinner.

"Young d'Esgrignon is getting out of his depth. He is not up to Paris. He will blow his brains
out. A little fool!" and so on and so on.

D'Esgrignon, however, promptly took comfort. His servant brought him two letters. The first
was from Chesnel. A letter from Chesnel smacked of the stale grumbling faithfulness of honesty
and its consecrated formulas. With all respect he put it aside till the evening. But the second
letter he read with unspeakable pleasure. In Ciceronian phrases, du Croisier groveled before
him, like a Sganarelle before a Geronte, begging the young Count in future to spare him the
affront of first depositing the amount of the bills which he should condescend to draw. The
concluding phrase seemed meant to convey the idea that here was an open cashbox full of coin
at the service of the noble d'Esgrignon family. So strong was the impression that Victurnien,
like Sganarelle or Mascarille in the play, like everybody else who feels a twinge of conscience
at his finger-tips, made an involuntary gesture.

Now that he was sure of unlimited credit with the Kellers, he opened Chesnel's letter gaily.
He had expected four full pages, full of expostulation to the brim; he glanced down the sheet
for the familiar words "prudence," "honor," "determination to do right," and the like, and
saw something else instead which made his head swim.

  "MONSIEUR LE COMTE,--Of all my fortune I have now but two hundred
  thousand francs left. I beg of you not to exceed that amount, if
  you should do one of the most devoted servants of your family the
  honor of taking it. I present my respects to you.

                                                   "CHESNEL."

"He is one of Plutarch's men," Victurnien said to himself, as he tossed the letter on the table.
He felt chagrined; such magnanimity made him feel very small.

"There! one must reform," he thought; and instead of going to a restaurant and spending fifty
or sixty francs over his dinner, he retrenched by dining with the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse,
and told her about the letter.

"I should like to see that man," she said, letting her eyes shine like two fixed stars.

"What would you do?"

"Why, he should manage my affairs for me."

Diane de Maufrigneuse was divinely dressed; she meant her toilet to do honor to Victurnien.
The levity with which she treated his affairs or, more properly speaking, his debts fascinated him.

The charming pair went to the Italiens. Never had that beautiful and enchanting woman looked
more seraphic, more ethereal. Nobody in the house could have believed that she had debts which
reached the sum total mentioned by de Marsay that very morning. No single one of the cares
of earth had touched that sublime forehead of hers, full of woman's pride of the highest kind.
In her, a pensive air seemed to be some gleam of an earthly love, nobly extinguished. The men
for the most part were wagering that Victurnien, with his handsome figure, laid her under contribution;
while the women, sure of their rival's subterfuge, admired her as Michael Angelo admired Raphael,
in petto. Victurnien loved Diane, according to one of these ladies, for the sake of her hair--she
had the most beautiful fair hair in France; another maintained that Diane's pallor was her
principal merit, for she was not really well shaped, her dress made the most of her figure;
yet others thought that Victurnien loved her for her foot, her one good point, for she had
a flat figure. But (and this brings the present-day manner of Paris before you in an astonishing
manner) whereas all the men said that the Duchess was subsidizing Victurnien's splendor, the
women, on the other hand, gave people to understand that it was Victurnien who paid for the
angel's wings, as Rastignac said.

As they drove back again, Victurnien had it on the tip of his tongue a score of times to open
this chapter, for the Duchess' debts weighed more heavily upon his mind than his own; and a
score of times his purpose died away before the attitude of the divine creature beside him.
He could see her by the light of the carriage lamps; she was bewitching in the love-languor
which always seemed to be extorted by the violence of passion from her madonna's purity. The
Duchess did not fall into the mistake of talking of her virtue, of her angel's estate, as provincial
women, her imitators, do. She was far too clever. She made him, for whom she made such great
sacrifices, think these things for himself. At the end of six months she could make him feel
that a harmless kiss on her hand was a deadly sin; she contrived that every grace should be
extorted from her, and this with such consummate art, that it was impossible not to feel that
she was more an angel than ever when she yielded.

None but Parisian women are clever enough always to give a new charm to the moon, to romanticize
the stars, to roll in the same sack of charcoal and emerge each time whiter than ever. This
is the highest refinement of intellectual and Parisian civilization. Women beyond the Rhine
or the English Channel believe nonsense of this sort when they utter it; while your Parisienne
makes her lover believe that she is an angel, the better to add to his bliss by flattering
his vanity on both sides--temporal and spiritual. Certain persons, detractors of the Duchess,
maintain that she was the first dupe of her own white magic. A wicked slander. The Duchess
believed in nothing but herself.

By the end of the year 1823 the Kellers had supplied Victurnien with two hundred thousand francs,
and neither Chesnel nor Mlle. Armande knew anything about it. CHAPTER X

After nearly a year's captivity, the King engaged to pay
a ransom, and, until the terms could be arranged, his two sons were
to be placed as hostages in the hands of the Normans, whilst he returned
to his own domains.

 The insidious current of life in Paris was bringing a
dreadful catastrophe upon the great and noble house; and only one person was in the secret
of it. This was du Croisier. He rubbed his hands gleefully as he went past in the dark and
looked in at the Antiquities. He had good hope of attaining his ends; and his ends were not,
as heretofore, the simple ruin of the d'Esgrignons, but the dishonor of their house. He felt
instinctively at such times that his revenge was at hand; he scented it in the wind! He had
been sure of it indeed from the day when he discovered that the young Count's burden of debt
was growing too heavy for the boy to bear.

Du Croisier's first step was to rid himself of his most hated enemy, the venerable Chesnel.
The good old man lived in the Rue du Bercail, in a house with a steep-pitched roof. There was
a little paved courtyard in front, where the rose-bushes grew and clambered up to the windows
of the upper story. Behind lay a little country garden, with its box-edged borders, shut in
by damp, gloomy-looking walls. The prim, gray-painted street door, with its wicket opening
and bell attached, announced quite as plainly as the official scutcheon that "a notary lives here."

It was half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, at which hour the old man usually sat digesting
his dinner. He had drawn his black leather-covered armchair before the fire, and put on his
armor, a painted pasteboard contrivance shaped like a top boot, which protected his stockinged
legs from the heat of the fire; for it was one of the good man's habits to sit for a while
after dinner with his feet on the dogs and to stir up the glowing coals. He always ate too
much; he was fond of good living. Alas! if it had not been for that little failing, would he
not have been more perfect than it is permitted to mortal man to be? Chesnel had finished his
cup of coffee. His old housekeeper had just taken away the tray which had been used for the
purpose for the last twenty years. He was waiting for his clerks to go before he himself went
out for his game at cards, and meanwhile he was thinking--no need to ask of whom or what. A
day seldom passed but he asked himself, "Where is he? What is he doing?" He thought that the
Count was in Italy with the fair Duchesse de Maufrigneuse.

When every franc of a man's fortune has come to him, not by inheritance, but through his own
earning and saving, it is one of his sweetest pleasures to look back upon the pains that have
gone to the making of it, and then to plan out a future for his crowns. This it is to conjugate
the verb "to enjoy" in every tense. And the old lawyer, whose affections were all bound up
in a single attachment, was thinking that all the carefully-chosen, well-tilled land which
he had pinched and scraped to buy would one day go to round the d'Esgrignon estates, and the
thought doubled his pleasure. His pride swelled as he sat at his ease in the old armchair;
and the building of glowing coals, which he raised with the tongs, sometimes seemed to him
to be the old noble house built up again, thanks to his care. He pictured the young Count's
prosperity, and told himself that he had done well to live for such an aim. Chesnel was not
lacking in intelligence; sheer goodness was not the sole source of his great devotion; he had
a pride of his own; he was like the nobles who used to rebuild a pillar in a cathedral to inscribe
their name upon it; he meant his name to be remembered by the great house which he had restored.
Future generations of d'Esgrignons should speak of old Chesnel. Just at this point his old
housekeeper came in with signs of alarm in her countenance.

"Is the house on fire, Brigitte?"

"Something of the sort," said she. "Here is M. du Croisier wanting to speak to you----"

"M. du Croisier," repeated the old lawyer. A stab of cold misgiving gave him so sharp a pang
at the heart that he dropped the tongs. "M. du Croisier here!" thought he, "our chief enemy!"

Du Croisier came in at that moment, like a cat that scents milk in a dairy. He made a bow,
seated himself quietly in the easy-chair which the lawyer brought forward, and produced a bill
for two hundred and twenty-seven thousand francs, principal and interest, the total amount
of sums advanced to M. Victurnien in bills of exchange drawn upon du Croisier, and duly honored
by him. "No man could wish it, nor need he. Only, the blind man may take the
comfort of it."

"But you have not answered one point, Father.

Why does God rouse longings in our hearts which He never means to
fulfil?"

"Does God rouse them?"

"Are they sin, then?"

"No," answered the Prior, slowly, as if he were thinking out the
question, and had barely reached the answer.

"I dare not say that.
They are nature.

Some, I know, would have all that is nature to be sin; but I doubt
if God treats it thus in His Word.

Still, I question if He raises
those longings. He allows them. Man raises them."
"Does He never guide them?"

"Yes, that I think He does."

"Then
the question comes to the same thing. Why does God not guide us to
long for the thing that He means to give us?" The sale
was completed within two days. Poor Chesnel could not bear the thought of the son of the house
undergoing a five years' imprisonment for debt. So in a few days' time nothing remained to
him but his practice, the sums that were due to him, and the house in which he lived. Chesnel,
stripped of all his lands, paced to and fro in his private office, paneled with dark oak, his
eyes fixed on the beveled edges of the chestnut cross-beams of the ceiling, or on the trellised
vines in the garden outside. He was not thinking of his farms now, or of Le Jard, his dear
house in the country; not he.

"What will become of him? He ought to come back; they must marry him to some rich heiress,"
he said to himself; and his eyes were dim, his head heavy.

How to approach Mlle. Armande, and in what words to break the news to her, he did not know.
The man who had just paid the debts of the family quaked at the thought of confessing these
things. He went from the Rue du Bercail to the Hotel d'Esgrignon with pulses throbbing like
some girl's heart when she leaves her father's roof by stealth, not to return again till she
is a mother and her heart is broken.

Mlle. Armande had just received a charming letter, charming in its hypocrisy. Her nephew was
the happiest man under the sun. He had been to the baths, he had been traveling in Italy with
Mme. de Maufrigneuse, and now sent his journal to his aunt. Every sentence was instinct with
love. There were enchanting descriptions of Venice, and fascinating appreciations of the great
works of Venetian art; there were most wonderful pages full of the Duomo at Milan, and again
of Florence; he described the Apennines, and how they differed from the Alps, and how in some
village like Chiavari happiness lay all around you, ready made.

The poor aunt was under the spell. She saw the far-off country of love, she saw, hovering above
the land, the angel whose tenderness gave to all that beauty a burning glow. She was drinking
in the letter at long draughts; how should it have been otherwise? The girl who had put love
from her was now a woman ripened by repressed and pent-up passion, by all the longings continually
and gladly offered up as a sacrifice on the altar of the hearth. Mlle. Armande was not like
the Duchess. She did not look like an angel. She was rather like the little, straight, slim
and slender, ivory-tinted statues, which those wonderful sculptors, the builders of cathedrals,
placed here and there about the buildings. Wild plants sometimes find a hold in the damp niches,
and weave a crown of beautiful bluebell flowers about the carved stone. At this moment the
blue buds were unfolding in the fair saint's eyes. Mlle. Armande loved the charming couple
as if they stood apart from real life; she saw nothing wrong in a married woman's love for
Victurnien; any other woman she would have judged harshly; but in this case, not to have loved
her nephew would have been the unpardonable sin. Aunts, mothers, and sisters have a code of
their own for nephews and sons and brothers.

Mlle. Armande was in Venice; she saw the lines of fairy palaces that stand on either side of
the Grand Canal; she was sitting in Victurnien's gondola; he was telling her what happiness
it had been to feel that the Duchess' beautiful hand lay in his own, to know that she loved
him as they floated together on the breast of the amorous Queen of Italian seas. But even in
that moment of bliss, such as angels know, some one appeared in the garden walk. It was Chesnel!
Alas! the sound of his tread on the gravel might have been the sound of the sands running from
Death's hour-glass to be trodden under his unshod feet. The sound, the sight of a dreadful
hopelessness in Chesnel's face, gave her that painful shock which follows a sudden recall of
the senses when the soul has sent them forth into the world of dreams.

"What is it?" she cried, as if some stab had pierced to her heart.

"All is lost!" said Chesnel. "M. le Comte will bring dishonor upon the house if we do not set
it in order." He held out the bills, and described the agony of the last few days in a few
simple but vigorous and touching words.

"He is deceiving us! The miserable boy!" cried Mlle. Armande, her heart swelling as the blood
surged back to it in heavy throbs.

"Let us both say mea culpa, mademoiselle," the old lawyer said stoutly; "we have always allowed
him to have his own way; he needed stern guidance; he could not have it from you with your
inexperience of life; nor from me, for he would not listen to me. He has had no mother."

"Fate sometimes deals terribly with a noble house in decay," said Mlle. Armande, with tears
in her eyes.

The Marquis came up as she spoke. He had been walking up and down the garden while he read
the letter sent by his son after his return. Victurnien gave his itinerary from an aristocrat's
point of view; telling how he had been welcomed by the greatest Italian families of Genoa,
Turin, Milan, Florence, Venice, Rome, and Naples. This flattering reception he owed to his
name, he said, and partly, perhaps, to the Duchess as well. In short, he had made his appearance
magnificently, and as befitted a d'Esgrignon.

"Have you been at your old tricks, Chesnel?" asked the Marquis.

Mlle. Armande made Chesnel an eager sign, dreadful to see. They understood each other. The
poor father, the flower of feudal honor, must die with all his illusions. A compact of silence
and devotion was ratified between the two noble hearts by a simple inclination of the head.

"Ah! Chesnel, it was not exactly in this way that the d'Esgrignons went into Italy at the end
of the fourteenth century, when Marshal Trivulzio, in the service of the King of France, served
under a d'Esgrignon, who had a Bayard too under his orders. Other times, other pleasures. And,
for that matter, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse is at least the equal of a Marchesa di Spinola."

And, on the strength of his genealogical tree, the old man swung himself off with a coxcomb's
air, as if he himself had once made a conquest of the Marchesa di Spinola, and still possessed
the Duchess of to-day.

The two companions in unhappiness were left together on the garden bench, with the same thought
for a bond of union. They sat for a long time, saying little save vague, unmeaning words, watching
the father walk away in his happiness, gesticulating as if he were talking to himself.

"What will become of him now?" Mlle. Armande asked after a while.

"Du Croisier has sent instructions to the MM. Keller; he is not to be allowed to draw any more
without authorization."

"And there are debts," continued Mlle. Armande.

"I am afraid so."

"If he is left without resources, what will he do?"

"I dare not answer that question to myself."

"But he must be drawn out of that life, he must come back to us, or he will have nothing left."

"And nothing else left to him," Chesnel said gloomily. But Mlle. Armande as yet did not and
could not understand the full force of those words.

"Is there any hope of getting him away from that woman, that Duchess? Perhaps she leads him on."

"He would not stick at a crime to be with her," said Chesnel, trying to pave the way to an
intolerable thought by others less intolerable.

"Crime," repeated Mlle. Armande. "Oh, Chesnel, no one but you would think of such a thing!"
she added, with a withering look; before such a look from a woman's eyes no mortal can stand.
"There is but one crime that a noble can commit--the crime of high treason; and when he is
beheaded, the block is covered with a black cloth, as it is for kings."

"The times have changed very much," said Chesnel, shaking his head. Victurnien had thinned
his last thin, white hairs. "Our Martyr-King did not die like the English King Charles."

That thought soothed Mlle. Armande's splendid indignation; a shudder ran through her; but still
she did not realize what Chesnel meant.

"To-morrow we will decide what we must do," she said; "it needs thought. At the worst, we have
our lands."

"Yes," said Chesnel. "You and M. le Marquis own the estate conjointly; but the larger part
of it is yours. You can raise money upon it without saying a word to him."

The players at whist, reversis, boston, and backgammon noticed that evening that Mlle. Armande's
features, usually so serene and pure, showed signs of agitation.

"That poor heroic child!" said the old Marquise de Casteran, "she must be suffering still.
A woman never knows what her sacrifices to her family may cost her."

Next day it was arranged with Chesnel that Mlle. Armande should go to Paris to snatch her nephew
from perdition. If any one could carry off Victurnien, was it not the woman whose motherly
heart yearned over him? Mlle. Armande made up her mind that she would go to the Duchesse de
Maufrigneuse and tell her all. Still, some sort of pretext was necessary to explain the journey
to the Marquis and the whole town. At some cost to her maidenly delicacy, Mlle. Armande allowed
it to be thought that she was suffering from a complaint which called for a consultation of
skilled and celebrated physicians. Goodness knows whether the town talked of this or no! But
Mlle. Armande saw that something far more than her own reputation was at stake. She set out.
Chesnel brought her his last bag of louis; she took it, without paying any attention to it,
as she took her white capuchine and thread mittens.

"Generous girl! What grace!" he said, as he put her into the carriage with her maid, a woman
who looked like a gray sister.

Du Croisier had thought out his revenge, as provincials think out everything. For studying
out a question in all its bearings, there are no folk in this world like savages, peasants,
and provincials; and this is how, when they proceed from thought to action, you find every
contingency provided for from beginning to end. Diplomatists are children compared with these
classes of mammals; they have time before them, an element which is lacking to those people
who are obliged to think about a great many things, to superintend the progress of all kinds
of schemes, to look forward for all sorts of contingencies in the wider interests of human
affairs. Had de Croisier sounded poor Victurnien's nature so well, that he foresaw how easily
the young Count would lend himself to his schemes of revenge? Or was he merely profiting by
an opportunity for which he had been on the watch for years? One circumstance there was, to
be sure, in his manner of preparing his stroke, which shows a certain skill. Who was it that
gave du Croisier warning of the moment? Was it the Kellers? Or could it have been President
du Ronceret's son, then finishing his law studies in Paris?

Du Croisier wrote to Victurnien, telling him that the Kellers had been instructed to advance
no more money; and that letter was timed to arrive just as the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse was
in the utmost perplexity, and the Comte d'Esgrignon consumed by the sense of poverty as dreadful
as it was cunningly hidden. The wretched young man was exerting all his ingenuity to seem as
if he were wealthy!

Now in the letter which informed the victim that in future the Kellers would make no further
advances without security, there was a tolerably wide space left between the forms of an exaggerated
respect and the signature. It was quite easy to tear off the best part of the letter and convert
it into a bill of exchange for any amount. The diabolical missive had been enclosed in an envelope,
so that the other side of the sheet was blank. When it arrived, Victurnien was writhing in
the lowest depths of despair. After two years of the most prosperous, sensual, thoughtless,
and luxurious life, he found himself face to face with the most inexorable poverty; it was
an absolute impossibility to procure money. There had been some throes of crisis before the
journey came to an end. With the Duchess' help he had managed to extort various sums from bankers;
but it had been with the greatest difficulty, and, moreover, those very amounts were about
to start up again before him as overdue bills of exchange in all their rigor, with a stern
summons to pay from the Bank of France and the commercial court. All through the enjoyments
of those last weeks the unhappy boy had felt the point of the Commander's sword; at every supper-party
he heard, like Don Juan, the heavy tread of the statue outside upon the stairs. He felt an
unaccountable creeping of the flesh, a warning that the sirocco of debt is nigh at hand. He
reckoned on chance. For five years he had never turned up a blank in the lottery, his purse
had always been replenished. After Chesnel had come du Croisier (he told himself), after du
Croisier surely another gold mine would pour out its wealth. And besides, he was winning great
sums at play; his luck at play had saved him several unpleasant steps already; and often a
wild hope sent him to the Salon des Etrangers only to lose his winnings afterwards at whist
at the club. His life for the past two months had been like the immortal finale of Mozart's
Don Giovanni; and of a truth, if a young man has come to such a plight as Victurnien's, that
finale is enough to make him shudder. Can anything better prove the enormous power of music
than that sublime rendering of the disorder and confusion arising out of a life wholly give
up to sensual indulgence? that fearful picture of a deliberate effort to shut out the thought
of debts and duels, deceit and evil luck? In that music Mozart disputes the palm with Moliere.
The terrific finale, with its glow, its power, its despair and laughter, its grisly spectres
and elfish women, centres about the prodigal's last effort made in the after-supper heat of
wine, the frantic struggle which ends the drama. Victurnien was living through this infernal
poem, and alone. He saw visions of himself--a friendless, solitary outcast, reading the words
carved on the stone, the last words on the last page of the book that had held him spellbound--THE
END!

Yes; for him all would be at an end, and that soon. Already he saw the cold, ironical eyes
which his associates would turn upon him, and their amusement over his downfall. Some of them
he knew were playing high on that gambling-table kept open all day long at the Bourse, or in
private houses at the clubs, and anywhere and everywhere in Paris; but not one of these men
could spare a banknote to save an intimate. There was no help for it--Chesnel must be ruined.
He had devoured Chesnel's living.

He sat with the Duchess in their box at the Italiens, the whole house envying them their happiness,
and while he smiled at her, all the Furies were tearing at his heart. Indeed, to give some
idea of the depths of doubt, despair, and incredulity in which the boy was groveling; he who
so clung to life--the life which the angel had made so fair--who so loved it, that he would
have stooped to baseness merely to live; he, the pleasure-loving scapegrace, the degenerate
d'Esgrignon, had even taken out his pistols, had gone so far as to think of suicide. He who
would never have brooked the appearance of an insult was abusing himself in language which
no man is likely to hear except from himself.

He left du Croisier's letter lying open on the bed. Josephin had brought it in at nine o'clock.
Victurnien's furniture had been seized, but he slept none the less. After he came back from
the Opera, he and the Duchess had gone to a voluptuous retreat, where they often spent a few
hours together after the most brilliant court balls and evening parties and gaieties. Appearances
were very cleverly saved. Their love-nest was a garret like any other to all appearance; Mme.
de Maufrigneuse was obliged to bow her head with its court feathers or wreath of flowers to
enter in at the door; but within all the peris of the East had made the chamber fair. And now
that the Count was on the brink of ruin, he had longed to bid farewell to the dainty nest,
which he had built to realize a day-dream worthy of his angel. Presently adversity would break
the enchanted eggs; there would be no brood of white doves, no brilliant tropical birds, no
more of the thousand bright-winged fancies which hover above our heads even to the last days
of our lives. Alas! alas! in three days he must be gone; his bills had fallen into the hands
of the money-lenders, the law proceedings had reached the last stage.

An evil thought crossed his brain. He would fly with the Duchess; they would live in some undiscovered
nook in the wilds of North or South America; but--he would fly with a fortune, and leave his
creditors to confront their bills. To carry out the plan, he had only to cut off the lower
portion of that letter with du Croisier's signature, and to fill in the figures to turn it
into a bill, and present it to the Kellers. There was a dreadful struggle with temptation;
tears shed, but the honor of the family triumphed, subject to one condition. Victurnien wanted
to be sure of his beautiful Diane; he would do nothing unless she should consent to their flight.
So he went to the Duchess in the Rue Faubourg Saint-Honore, and found her in coquettish morning
dress, which cost as much in thought as in money, a fit dress in which to begin to play the
part of Angel at eleven o'clock in the morning.

Mme. de Maufrigneuse was somewhat pensive. Cares of a similar kind were gnawing her mind; but
she took them gallantly. Of all the various feminine organizations classified by physiologists,
there is one that has something indescribably terrible about it. Such women combine strength
of soul and clear insight, with a faculty for prompt decision, and a recklessness, or rather
resolution in a crisis which would shake a man's nerves. And these powers lie out of sight
beneath an appearance of the most graceful helplessness. Such women only among womankind afford
examples of a phenomenon which Buffon recognized in men alone, to wit, the union, or rather
the disunion, of two different natures in one human being. Other women are wholly women; wholly
tender, wholly devoted, wholly mothers, completely null and completely tiresome; nerves and
brain and blood are all in harmony; but the Duchess, and others like her, are capable of rising
to the highest heights of feelings, or of showing the most selfish insensibility. It is one
of the glories of Moliere that he has given us a wonderful portrait of such a woman, from one
point of view only, in that greatest of his full-length figures--Celimene; Celimene is the
typical aristocratic woman, as Figaro, the second edition of Panurge, represents the people.

So, the Duchess, being overwhelmed with debt, laid it upon herself to give no more than a moment's
thought to the avalanche of cares, and to take her resolution once and for all; Napoleon could
take up or lay down the burden of his thoughts in precisely the same way. The Duchess possessed
the faculty of standing aloof from herself; she could look on as a spectator at the crash when
it came, instead of submitting to be buried beneath. This was certainly great, but repulsive
in a woman. When she awoke in the morning she collected her thoughts; and by the time she had
begun to dress she had looked at the danger in its fullest extent and faced the possibilities
of terrific downfall. She pondered. Should she take refuge in a foreign country? Or should
she go to the King and declare her debts to him? Or again, should she fascinate a du Tillet
or a Nucingen, and gamble on the stock exchange to pay her creditors? The city man would find
the money; he would be intelligent enough to bring her nothing but the profits, without so
much as mentioning the losses, a piece of delicacy which would gloss all over. The catastrophe,
and these various ways of averting it, had all been reviewed quite coolly, calmly, and without
trepidation.

As a naturalist takes up some king of butterflies and fastens him down on cotton-wool with
a pin, so Mme. de Maufrigneuse had plucked love out of her heart while she pondered the necessity
of the moment, and was quite ready to replace the beautiful passion on its immaculate setting
so soon as her duchess' coronet was safe. She knew none of the hesitation which Cardinal Richelieu
hid from all the world but Pere Joseph; none of the doubts that Napoleon kept at first entirely
to himself. "Either the one or the other," she told herself.

She was sitting by the fire, giving orders for her toilette for a drive in the Bois if the
weather should be fine, when Victurnien came in.

The Comte d'Esgrignon, with all his stifled capacity, his so keen intellect, was in exactly
the state which might have been looked for in the woman. His heart was beating violently, the
perspiration broke out over him as he stood in his dandy's trappings; he was afraid as yet
to lay a hand on the corner-stone which upheld the pyramid of his life with Diane. So much
it cost him to know the truth. The cleverest men are fain to deceive themselves on one or two
points if the truth once known is likely to humiliate them in their own eyes, and damage themselves
with themselves. Victurnien forced his own irresolution into the field by committing himself.

"What is the matter with you?" Diane de Maufrigneuse had said at once, at the sight of her
beloved Victurnien's face.

"Why, dear Diane, I am in such a perplexity; a man gone to the bottom and at his last gasp
is happy in comparison."

"Pshaw! it is nothing," said she; "you are a child. Let us see now; tell me about it."

"I am hopelessly in debt. I have come to the end of my tether."

"Is that all?" said she, smiling at him. "Money matters can always be arranged somehow or other;
nothing is irretrievable except disasters in love."

Victurnien's mind being set at rest by this swift comprehension of his position, he unrolled
the bright-colored web of his life for the last two years and a half; but it was the seamy
side of it which he displayed with something of genius, and still more of wit, to his Diane.
He told his tale with the inspiration of the moment, which fails no one in great crises; he
had sufficient artistic skill to set it off by a varnish of delicate scorn for men and things.
It was an aristocrat who spoke. And the Duchess listened as she could listen.

One knee was raised, for she sat with her foot on a stool. She rested her elbow on her knee
and leant her face on her hand so that her fingers closed daintily over her shapely chin. Her
eyes never left his; but thoughts by myriads flitted under the blue surface, like gleams of
stormy light between two clouds. Her forehead was calm, her mouth gravely intent--grave with
love; her lips were knotted fast by Victurnien's lips. To have her listening thus was to believe
that a divine love flowed from her heart. Wherefore, when the Count had proposed flight to
this soul, so closely knit to his own, he could not help crying, "You are an angel!"

The fair Maufrigneuse made silent answer; but she had not spoken as yet.

"Good, very good," she said at last. (She had not given herself up to the love expressed in
her face; her mind had been entirely absorbed by deep-laid schemes which she kept to herself.)
"But that is not the question, dear." (The "angel" was only "that" by this time.) "Let us think
of your affairs. Yes, we will go, and the sooner the better. Arrange it all; I will follow
you. It is glorious to leave Paris and the world behind. I will set about my preparations in
such a way that no one can suspect anything."

I will follow you! Just so Mlle. Mars might have spoken those words to send a thrill through
two thousand listening men and women. When a Duchesse de Maufrigneuse offers, in such words,
to make such a sacrifice to love, she has paid her debt. How should Victurnien speak of sordid
details after that? He could so much the better hide his schemes, because Diane was particularly
careful not to inquire into them. She was now, and always, as de Marsay said, an invited guest
at a banquet wreathed with roses, a banquet which mankind, as in duty bound, made ready for her.

Victurnien would not go till the promise had been sealed. He must draw courage from his happiness
before he could bring himself to do a deed on which, as he inwardly told himself, people would
be certain to put a bad construction. Still (and this was the thought that decided him) he
counted on his aunt and father to hush up the affair; he even counted on Chesnel. Chesnel would
think of one more compromise. Besides, "this business," as he called it in his thoughts, was
the only way of raising money on the family estate. With three hundred thousand francs, he
and Diane would lead a happy life hidden in some palace in Venice; and there they would forget
the world. They went through their romance in advance.

Next day Victurnien made out a bill for three hundred thousand francs, and took it to the Kellers.
The Kellers advanced the money, for du Croisier happened to have a balance at the time; but
they wrote to let him know that he must not draw again on them without giving them notice.
Du Croisier, much astonished, asked for a statement of accounts. It was sent. Everything was
explained. The day of his vengeance had arrived.

When Victurnien had drawn "his" money, he took it to Mme. de Maufrigneuse. She locked up the
banknotes in her desk, and proposed to bid the world farewell by going to the Opera to see
it for the last time. Victurnien was thoughtful, absent, and uneasy. He was beginning to reflect.
He thought that his seat in the Duchess' box might cost him dear; that perhaps, when he had
put the three hundred thousand francs in safety, it would be better to travel post, to fall
at Chesnel's feet, and tell him all. But before they left the opera-house, the Duchess, in
spite of herself, gave Victurnien an adorable glance, her eyes were shining with the desire
to go back once more to bid farewell to the nest which she loved so much. And boy that he was,
he lost a night.

The next day, at three o'clock, he was back again at the Hotel de Maufrigneuse; he had come
to take the Duchess' orders for that night's escape. And, "Why should we go?" asked she; "I
have thought it all out. The Vicomtesse de Beauseant and the Duchesse de Langeais disappeared.
If I go too, it will be something quite commonplace. We will brave the storm. It will be a
far finer thing to do. I am sure of success." Victurnien's eyes dazzled; he felt as if his
skin were dissolving and the blood oozing out all over him.

"What is the matter with you?" cried the fair Diane, noticing a hesitation which a woman never
forgives. Your truly adroit lover will hasten to agree with any fancy that Woman may take into
her head, and suggest reasons for doing otherwise, while leaving her free exercise of her right
to change her mind, her intentions, and sentiments generally as often as she pleases. Victurnien
was angry for the first time, angry with the wrath of a weak man of poetic temperament; it
was a storm of rain and lightning flashes, but no thunder followed. The angel on whose faith
he had risked more than his life, the honor of his house, was very roughly handled.

"So," said she, "we have come to this after eighteen months of tenderness! You are unkind,
very unkind. Go away!--I do not want to see you again. I thought that you loved me. You do not."

"I do not love you?" repeated he, thunderstruck by the reproach.

"No, monsieur."

"And yet----" he cried. "Ah! if you but knew what I have just done for your sake!"

"And how have you done so much for me, monsieur? As if a man ought not to do anything for a
woman that has done so much for him."

"You are not worthy to know it!" Victurnien cried in a passion of anger.

"Oh!"

After that sublime, "Oh!" Diane bowed her head on her hand and sat, still, cold, and implacable
as angels naturally may be expected to do, seeing that they share none of the passions of humanity.
At the sight of the woman he loved in this terrible attitude, Victurnien forgot his danger.
Had he not just that moment wronged the most angelic creature on earth? He longed for forgiveness,
he threw himself before her, he kissed her feet, he pleaded, he wept. Two whole hours the unhappy
young man spent in all kinds of follies, only to meet the same cold face, while the great silent
tears dropping one by one, were dried as soon as they fell lest the unworthy lover should try
to wipe them away. The Duchess was acting a great agony, one of those hours which stamp the
woman who passes through them as something august and sacred.

Two more hours went by. By this time the Count had gained possession of Diane's hand; it felt
cold and spiritless. The beautiful hand, with all the treasures in its grasp, might have been
supple wood; there was nothing of Diane in it; he had taken it, it had not been given to him.
As for Victurnien, the spirit had ebbed out of his frame, he had ceased to think. He would
not have seen the sun in heaven. What was to be done? What course should he take? What resolution
should he make? The man who can keep his head in such circumstances must be made of the same
stuff as the convict who spent the night in robbing the Bibliotheque Royale of its gold medals,
and repaired to his honest brother in the morning with a request to melt down the plunder.
"What is to be done?" cried the brother. "Make me some coffee," replied the thief. Victurnien
sank into a bewildered stupor, darkness settled down over his brain. Visions of past rapture
flitted across the misty gloom like the figures that Raphael painted against a black background;
to these he must bid farewell. Inexorable and disdainful, the Duchess played with the tip of
her scarf. She looked in irritation at Victurnien from time to time; she coquetted with memories,
she spoke to her lover of his rivals as if anger had finally decided her to prefer one of them
to a man who could so change in one moment after twenty-eight months of love.

"Ah! that charming young Felix de Vandenesse, so faithful as he was to Mme. de Mortsauf, would
never have permitted himself such a scene! He can love, can de Vandenesse! De Marsay, that
terrible de Marsay, such a tiger as everyone thought him, was rough with other men; but like
all strong men, he kept his gentleness for women. Montriveau trampled the Duchesse de Langeais
under foot, as Othello killed Desdemona, in a burst of fury which at any rate proved the extravagance
of his love. It was not like a paltry squabble. There was rapture in being so crushed. Little,
fair-haired, slim, and slender men loved to torment women; they could only reign over poor,
weak creatures; it pleased them to have some ground for believing that they were men. The tyranny
of love was their one chance of asserting their power. She did not know why she had put herself
at the mercy of fair hair. Such men as de Marsay, Montriveau, and Vandenesse, dark-haired and
well grown, had a ray of sunlight in their eyes."

It was a storm of epigrams. Her speeches, like bullets, came hissing past his ears. Every word
that Diane hurled at him was triple-barbed; she humiliated, stung, and wounded him with an
art that was all her own, as half a score of savages can torture an enemy bound to a stake.

"You are mad!" he cried at last, at the end of his patience, and out he went in God knows what
mood. He drove as if he had never handled the reins before, locked his wheels in the wheels
of other vehicles, collided with the curbstone in the Place Louis-Quinze, went he knew not
whither. The horse, left to its own devices, made a bolt for the stable along the Quai d'Orsay;
but as he turned into the Rue de l'Universite, Josephin appeared to stop the runaway.

"You cannot go home, sir," the old man said, with a scared face; "they have come with a warrant
to arrest you."

Victurnien thought that he had been arrested on the criminal charge, albeit there had not been
time for the public prosecutor to receive his instructions. He had forgotten the matter of
the bills of exchange, which had been stirred up again for some days past in the form of orders
to pay, brought by the officers of the court with accompaniments in the shape of bailiffs,
men in possession, magistrates, commissaries, policemen, and other representatives of social
order. Like most guilty creatures, Victurnien had forgotten everything but his crime.

"It is all over with me," he cried.

"No, M. le Comte, drive as fast as you can to the Hotel du Bon la Fontaine, in the Rue de Grenelle.
Mlle. Armande is waiting there for you, the horses have been put in, she will take you with her."

Victurnien, in his trouble, caught like a drowning man at the branch that came to his hand;
he rushed off to the inn, reached the place, and flung his arms about his aunt. Mlle. Armande
cried as if her heart would break; any one might have thought that she had a share in her nephew's
guilt. They stepped into the carriage. A few minutes later they were on the road to Brest,
and Paris lay behind them. Victurnien uttered not a sound; he was paralyzed. And when aunt
and nephew began to speak, they talked at cross purposes; Victurnien, still laboring under
the unlucky misapprehension which flung him into Mlle. Armande's arms, was thinking of his
forgery; his aunt had the debts and the bills on her mind.

"You know all, aunt," he had said.

"Poor boy, yes, but we are here. I am not going to scold you just yet. Take heart."

"I must hide somewhere."

"Perhaps.... Yes, it is a very good idea."

"Perhaps I might get into Chesnel's house without being seen if we timed ourselves to arrive
in the middle of the night?"

"That will be best. We shall be better able to hide this from my brother.--Poor angel! how
unhappy he is!" said she, petting the unworthy child.

"Ah! now I begin to know what dishonor means; it has chilled my love."

"Unhappy boy; what bliss and what misery!" And Mlle. Armande drew his fevered face to her breast
and kissed his forehead, cold and damp though it was, as the holy women might have kissed the
brow of the dead Christ when they laid Him in His grave clothes. Following out the excellent
scheme suggested by the prodigal son, he was brought by night to the quiet house in the Rue
du Bercail; but chance ordered it that by so doing he ran straight into the wolf's jaws, as
the saying goes. That evening Chesnel had been making arrangements to sell his connection to
M. Lepressoir's head-clerk. M. Lepressoir was the notary employed by the Liberals, just as
Chesnel's practice lay among the aristocratic families. The young fellow's relatives were rich
enough to pay Chesnel the considerable sum of a hundred thousand francs in cash.

Chesnel was rubbing his hands. "A hundred thousand francs will go a long way in buying up debts,"
he thought. "The young man is paying a high rate of interest on his loans. We will lock him
up down here. I will go yonder myself and bring those curs to terms."

Chesnel, honest Chesnel, upright, worthy Chesnel, called his darling Comte Victurnien's creditors
"curs."

Meanwhile his successor was making his way along the Rue du Bercail just as Mlle. Armande's
traveling carriage turned into it. Any young man might be expected to feel some curiosity if
he saw a traveling carriage stop at a notary's door in such a town and at such an hour of the
night; the young man in question was sufficiently inquisitive to stand in a doorway and watch.
He saw Mlle. Armande alight.

"Mlle. Armande d'Esgrignon at this time of night!" said he to himself. "What can be going forward
at the d'Esgrignons'?"

At the sight of mademoiselle, Chesnel opened the door circumspectly and set down the light
which he was carrying; but when he looked out and saw Victurnien, Mlle. Armande's first whispered
word made the whole thing plain to him. He looked up and down the street; it seemed quite deserted;
he beckoned, and the young Count sprang out of the carriage and entered the courtyard. All
was lost. Chesnel's successor had discovered Victurnien's hiding place.

Victurnien was hurried into the house and installed in a room beyond Chesnel's private office.
No one could enter it except across the old man's dead body.

"Ah! M. le Comte!" exclaimed Chesnel, notary no longer.

"Yes, monsieur," the Count answered, understanding his old friend's exclamation. "I did not
listen to you; and now I have fallen into the depths, and I must perish."

"No, no," the good man answered, looking triumphantly from Mlle. Armande to the Count. "I have
sold my connection. I have been working for a very long time now, and am thinking of retiring.
By noon to-morrow I shall have a hundred thousand francs; many things can be settled with that.
Mademoiselle, you are tired," he added; "go back to the carriage and go home and sleep. Business
to-morrow."

"Is he safe?" returned she, looking at Victurnien.

"Yes."

She kissed her nephew; a few tears fell on his forehead. Then she went.

"My good Chesnel," said the Count, when they began to talk of business, "what are your hundred
thousand francs in such a position as mine? You do not know the full extent of my troubles,
I think."

Victurnien explained the situation. Chesnel was thunderstruck. But for the strength of his
devotion, he would have succumbed to this blow. Tears streamed from the eyes that might well
have had no tears left to shed. For a few moments he was a child again, for a few moments he
was bereft of his senses; he stood like a man who should find his own house on fire, and through
a window see the cradle ablaze and hear the hiss of the flames on his children's curls. He
rose to his full height--il se dressa en pied, as Amyot would have said; he seemed to grow
taller; he raised his withered hands and wrung them despairingly and wildly.

"If only your father may die and never know this, young man! To be a forger is enough; a parricide
you must not be. Fly, you say? No. They would condemn you for contempt of court! Oh, wretched
boy! Why did you not forge my signature? I would have paid; I should not have taken the bill
to the public prosecutor.--Now I can do nothing. You have brought me to a stand in the lowest
pit in hell!--Du Croisier! What will come of it? What is to be done?--If you had killed a man,
there might be some help for it. But forgery--forgery! And time--the time is flying," he went
on, shaking his fist towards the old clock. "You will want a sham passport now. One crime leads
to another. First," he added, after a pause, "first of all we must save the house of d'Esgrignon."

"But the money is still in Mme. de Maufrigneuse's keeping," exclaimed Victurnien.

"Ah!" exclaimed Chesnel. "Well, there is some hope left--a faint hope. Could we soften du Croisier,
I wonder, or buy him over? He shall have all the lands if he likes. I will go to him; I will
wake him and offer him all we have.--Besides, it was not you who forged that bill; it was I.
I will go to jail; I am too old for the hulks, they can only put me in prison."

"But the body of the bill is in my handwriting," objected Victurnien, without a sign of surprise
at this reckless devotion.

"Idiot!... that is, pardon, M. le Comte. Josephin should have been made to write it," the old
notary cried wrathfully. "He is a good creature; he would have taken it all on his shoulders.
But there is an end of it; the world is falling to pieces," the old man continued, sinking
exhausted into a chair. "Du Croisier is a tiger; we must be careful not to rouse him. What
time is it? Where is the draft? If it is at Paris, it might be bought back from the Kellers;
they might accommodate us. Ah! but there are dangers on all sides; a single false step means
ruin. Money is wanted in any case. But there! nobody knows you are here, you must live buried
away in the cellar if needs must. I will go at once to Paris as fast as I can; I can hear the
mail coach from Brest."

In a moment the old man recovered the faculties of his youth--his agility and vigor. He packed
up clothes for the journey, took money, brought a six-pound loaf to the little room beyond
the office, and turned the key on his child by adoption.

"Not a sound in here," he said, "no light at night; and stop here till I come back, or you
will go to the hulks. Do you understand, M. le Comte? Yes, to the hulks! if anybody in a town
like this knows that you are here."

With that Chesnel went out, first telling his housekeeper to give out that he was ill, to allow
no one to come into the house, to send everybody away, and to postpone business of every kind
for three days. He wheedled the manager of the coach-office, made up a tale for his benefit--he
had the makings of an ingenious novelist in him--and obtained a promise that if there should
be a place, he should have it, passport or no passport, as well as a further promise to keep
the hurried departure a secret. Luckily, the coach was empty when it arrived.

In the middle of the following night Chesnel was set down in Paris. At nine o'clock in the
morning he waited on the Kellers, and learned that the fatal draft had returned to du Croisier
three days since; but while obtaining this information, he in no way committed himself. Before
he went away he inquired whether the draft could be recovered if the amount were refunded.
Francois Keller's answer was to the effect that the document was du Croisier's property, and
that it was entirely in his power to keep or return it. Then, in desperation, the old man went
to the Duchess.

Mme. de Maufrigneuse was not at home to any visitor at that hour. Chesnel, feeling that every
moment was precious, sat down in the hall, wrote a few lines, and succeeded in sending them
to the lady by dint of wheedling, fascinating, bribing, and commanding the most insolent and
inaccessible servants in the world. The Duchess was still in bed; but, to the great astonishment
of her household, the old man in black knee-breeches, ribbed stockings, and shoes with buckles
to them, was shown into her room.

"What is it, monsieur?" she asked, posing in her disorder. "What does he want of me, ungrateful
that he is?"

"It is this, Mme. la Duchesse," the good man exclaimed, "you have a hundred thousand crowns
belonging to us."

"Yes," began she. "What does it signify----?"

"The money was gained by a forgery, for which we are going to the hulks, a forgery which we
committed for love of you," Chesnel said quickly. "How is it that you did not guess it, so
clever as you are? Instead of scolding the boy, you ought to have had the truth out of him,
and stopped him while there was time, and saved him."

At the first words the Duchess understood; she felt ashamed of her behavior to so impassioned
a lover, and afraid besides that she might be suspected of complicity. In her wish to prove
that she had not touched the money left in her keeping, she lost all regard for appearances;
and besides, it did not occur to her that the notary was a man. She flung off the eider-down
quilt, sprang to her desk (flitting past the lawyer like an angel out of one of the vignettes
which illustrate Lamartine's books), held out the notes, and went back in confusion to bed.

"You are an angel, madame." (She was to be an angel for all the world, it seemed.) "But this
will not be the end of it. I count upon your influence to save us."

"To save you! I will do it or die! Love that will not shrink from a crime must be love indeed.
Is there a woman in the world for whom such a thing has been done? Poor boy! Come, do not lose
time, dear M. Chesnel; and count upon me as upon yourself."

"Mme. la Duchesse! Mme. la Duchesse!" It was all that he could say, so overcome was he. He
cried, he could have danced; but he was afraid of losing his senses, and refrained.

"Between us, we will save him," she said, as he left the room.

Chesnel went straight to Josephin. Josephin unlocked the young Count's desk and writing-table.
Very luckily, the notary found letters which might be useful, letters from du Croisier and
the Kellers. Then he took a place in a diligence which was just about to start; and by dint
of fees to the postilions, the lumbering vehicle went as quickly as the coach. His two fellow-passengers
on the journey happened to be in as great a hurry as himself, and readily agreed to take their
meals in the carriage. Thus swept over the road, the notary reached the Rue du Bercail, after
three days of absence, an hour before midnight. And yet he was too late. He saw the gendarmes
at the gate, crossed the threshold, and met the young Count in the courtyard. Victurnien had
been arrested. If Chesnel had had the power, he would beyond a doubt have killed the officers
and men; as it was, he could only fall on Victurnien's neck.

"If I cannot hush this matter up, you must kill yourself before the indictment is made out,"
he whispered. But Victurnien had sunk into such stupor, that he stared back uncomprehendingly.

"Kill myself?" he repeated.

"Yes. If your courage should fail, my boy, count upon me," said Chesnel, squeezing Victurnien's
hand.

In spite of the anguish of mind and tottering limbs, he stood firmly planted, to watch the
son of his heart, the Comte d'Esgrignon, go out of the courtyard between two gendarmes, with
the commissary, the justice of the peace, and the clerk of the court; and not until the figures
had disappeared, and the sound of footsteps had died away into silence, did he recover his
firmness and presence of mind.

"You will catch cold, sir," Brigitte remonstrated.

"The devil take you!" cried her exasperated master.

Never in the nine-and-twenty years that Brigitte had been in his service had she heard such
words from him! Her candle fell out of her hands, but Chesnel neither heeded his housekeeper's
alarm nor heard her exclaim. He hurried off towards the Val-Noble.

"He is out of his mind," said she; "after all, it is no wonder. But where is he off to? I cannot
possibly go after him. What will become of him? Suppose that he should drown himself?"

And Brigitte went to waken the head-clerk and send him to look along the river bank; the river
had a gloomy reputation just then, for there had lately been two cases of suicide--one a young
man full of promise, and the other a girl, a victim of seduction. Chesnel went straight to
the Hotel du Croisier. There lay his only hope. The law requires that a charge of forgery must
be brought by a private individual. It was still possible to withdraw if du Croisier chose
to admit that there had been a misapprehension; and Chesnel had hopes, even then, of buying
the man over.

M. and Mme. du Croisier had much more company than usual that evening. Only a few persons were
in the secret. M. du Ronceret, president of the Tribunal; M. Sauvager, deputy Public Prosecutor;
and M. du Coudrai, a registrar of mortgages, who had lost his post by voting on the wrong side,
were the only persons who were supposed to know about it; but Mesdames du Ronceret and du Coudrai
had told the news, in strict confidence, to one or two intimate friends, so that it had spread
half over the semi-noble, semi-bourgeois assembly at M. du Croisier's. Everybody felt the gravity
of the situation, but no one ventured to speak of it openly; and, moreover, Mme. du Croisier's
attachment to the upper sphere was so well known, that people scarcely dared to mention the
disaster which had befallen the d'Esgrignons or to ask for particulars. The persons most interested
were waiting till good Mme. du Croisier retired, for that lady always retreated to her room
at the same hour to perform her religious exercises as far as possible out of her husband's sight.

Du Croisier's adherents, knowing the secret and the plans of the great commercial power, looked
round when the lady of the house disappeared; but there were still several persons present
whose opinions or interests marked them out as untrustworthy, so they continued to play. About
half past eleven all had gone save intimates: M. Sauvager, M. Camusot, the examining magistrate,
and his wife, M. and Mme. du Ronceret and their son Fabien, M. and Mme. du Coudrai, and Joseph
Blondet, the eldest of an old judge; ten persons in all.

It is told of Talleyrand that one fatal day, three hours after midnight, he suddenly interrupted
a game of cards in the Duchesse de Luynes' house by laying down his watch on the table and
asking the players whether the Prince de Conde had any child but the Duc d'Enghien.

"Why do you ask?" returned Mme. de Luynes, "when you know so well that he has not."

"Because if the Prince has no other son, the House of Conde is now at an end."

There was a moment's pause, and they finished the game.--President du Ronceret now did something
very similar. Perhaps he had heard the anecdote; perhaps, in political life, little minds and
great minds are apt to hit upon the same expression. He looked at his watch, and interrupted
the game of boston with:

"At this moment M. le Comte d'Esgrignon is arrested, and that house which has held its head
so high is dishonored forever."

"Then, have you got hold of the boy?" du Coudrai cried gleefully.

Every one in the room, with the exception of the President, the deputy, and du Croisier, looked
startled.

"He has just been arrested in Chesnel's house, where he was hiding," said the deputy public
prosecutor, with the air of a capable but unappreciated public servant, who ought by rights
to be Minister of Police. M. Sauvager, the deputy, was a thin, tall young man of five-and-twenty,
with a lengthy olive-hued countenance, black frizzled hair, and deep-set eyes; the wide, dark
rings beneath them were completed by the wrinkled purple eyelids above. With a nose like the
beak of some bird of prey, a pinched mouth, and cheeks worn lean with study and hollowed by
ambition, he was the very type of a second-rate personage on the lookout for something to turn
up, and ready to do anything if so he might get on in the world, while keeping within the limitations
of the possible and the forms of law. His pompous expression was an admirable indication of
the time-serving eloquence to be expected of him. Chesnel's successor had discovered the young
Count's hiding place to him, and he took great credit to himself for his penetration.

The news seemed to come as a shock to the examining magistrate, M. Camusot, who had granted
the warrant of arrest on Sauvager's application, with no idea that it was to be executed so
promptly. Camusot was short, fair, and fat already, though he was only thirty years old or
thereabouts; he had the flabby, livid look peculiar to officials who live shut up in their
private study or in a court of justice; and his little, pale, yellow eyes were full of the
suspicion which is often mistaken for shrewdness.

Mme. Camusot looked at her spouse, as who should say, "Was I not right?"

"Then the case will come on," was Camusot's comment.

"Could you doubt it?" asked du Coudrai. "Now they have got the Count, all is over."

"There is the jury," said Camusot. "In this case M. le Prefet is sure to take care that after
the challenges from the prosecution and the defence, the jury to a man will be for an acquittal.--My
advice would be to come to a compromise," he added, turning to du Croisier.

"Compromise!" echoed the President; "why, he is in the hands of justice."

"Acquitted or convicted, the Comte d'Esgrignon will be dishonored all the same," put in Sauvager.

"I am bringing an action,"[*] said du Croisier. "I shall have Dupin senior. We shall see how
the d'Esgrignon family will escape out of his clutches."

     [*] A trial for an offence of this kind in France is an
     action brought by a private person (partie civile) to
     recover damages, and at the same time a criminal prosecution
     conducted on behalf of the Government.--Tr.

"The d'Esgrignons will defend the case and have counsel from Paris; they will have Berryer,"
said Mme. Camusot. "You will have a Roland for your Oliver."

Du Croisier, M. Sauvager, and the President du Ronceret looked at Camusot, and one thought
troubled their minds. The lady's tone, the way in which she flung her proverb in the faces
of the eight conspirators against the house of d'Esgrignon, caused them inward perturbation,
which they dissembled as provincials can dissemble, by dint of lifelong practice in the shifts
of a monastic existence. Little Mme. Camusot saw their change of countenance and subsequent
composure when they scented opposition on the part of the examining magistrate. When her husband
unveiled the thoughts in the back of his own mind, she had tried to plumb the depths of hate
in du Croisier's adherents. She wanted to find out how du Croisier had gained over this deputy
public prosecutor, who had acted so promptly and so directly in opposition to the views of
the central power.

"In any case," continued she, "if celebrated counsel come down from Paris, there is a prospect
of a very interesting session in the Court of Assize; but the matter will be snuffed out between
the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal. It is only to be expected that the Government should
do all that can be done, below the surface, to save a young man who comes of a great family,
and has the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse for a friend. So I think that we shall have a 'sensation
at Landernau.'"

"How you go on, madame!" the President said sternly. "Can you suppose that the Court of First
Instance will be influenced by considerations which have nothing to do with justice?"

"The event proves the contrary," she said meaningly, looking full at Sauvager and the President,
who glanced coldly at her.

"Explain yourself, madame," said Sauvager, "you speak as if we had not done our duty."

"Mme. Camusot meant nothing," interposed her husband.

"But has not M. le President just said something prejudicing a case which depends on the examination
of the prisoner?" said she. "And the evidence is still to be taken, and the Court had not given
its decision?"

"We are not at the law-courts," the deputy public prosecutor replied tartly; "and besides,
we know all that."

"But the public prosecutor knows nothing at all about it yet," returned she, with an ironical
glance. "He will come back from the Chamber of Deputies in all haste. You have cut out his
work for him, and he, no doubt, will speak for himself."

The deputy prosecutor knitted his thick bushy brows. Those interested read tardy scruples in
his countenance. A great silence followed, broken by no sound but the dealing of the cards.
M. and Mme. Camusot, sensible of a decided chill in the atmosphere, took their departure to
leave the conspirators to talk at their ease.

"Camusot," the lady began in the street, "you went too far. Why lead those people to suspect
that you will have no part in their schemes? They will play you some ugly trick."

"What can they do? I am the only examining magistrate."

"Cannot they slander you in whispers, and procure your dismissal?"

At that very moment Chesnel ran up against the couple. The old notary recognized the examining
magistrate; and with the lucidity which comes of an experience of business, he saw that the
fate of the d'Esgrignons lay in the hands of the young man before him.

"Ah, sir!" he exclaimed, "we shall soon need you badly. Just a word with you.--Your pardon,
madame," he added, as he drew Camusot aside.

Mme. Camusot, as a good conspirator, looked towards du Croisier's house, ready to break up
the conversation if anybody appeared; but she thought, and thought rightly, that their enemies
were busy discussing this unexpected turn which she had given to the affair. Chesnel meanwhile
drew the magistrate into a dark corner under the wall, and lowered his voice for his companion's
ear.

"If you are for the house of d'Esgrignon," he said, "Mme. la Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, the
Prince of Cadignan, the Ducs de Navarreins and de Lenoncourt, the Keeper of the Seals, the
Chancellor, the King himself, will interest themselves in you. I have just come from Paris;
I knew all about this; I went post-haste to explain everything at Court. We are counting on
you, and I will keep your secret. If you are hostile, I shall go back to Paris to-morrow and
lodge a complaint with the Keeper of the Seals that there is a suspicion of corruption. Several
functionaries were at du Croisier's house to-night, and no doubt, ate and drank there, contrary
to law; and besides, they are friends of his."

Chesnel would have brought the Almighty to intervene if he had had the power. He did not wait
for an answer; he left Camusot and fled like a deer towards du Croisier's house. Camusot, meanwhile,
bidden to reveal the notary's confidences, was at once assailed with, "Was I not right, dear?"--a
wifely formula used on all occasions, but rather more vehemently when the fair speaker is in
the wrong. By the time they reached home, Camusot had admitted the superiority of his partner
in life, and appreciated his good fortune in belonging to her; which confession, doubtless,
was the prelude of a blissful night.

Chesnel met his foes in a body as they left du Croisier's house, and began to fear that du
Croisier had gone to bed. In his position he was compelled to act quickly, and any delay was
a misfortune.

"In the King's name!" he cried, as the man-servant was closing the hall door. He had just brought
the King on the scene for the benefit of an ambitious little official, and the word was still
on his lips. He fretted and chafed while the door was unbarred; then, swift as a thunderbolt,
dashed into the ante-chamber, and spoke to the servant.

"A hundred crowns to you, young man, if you can wake Mme. du Croisier and send her to me this
instant. Tell her anything you like."

Chesnel grew cool and composed as he opened the door of the brightly lighted drawing-room,
where du Croisier was striding up and down. For a moment the two men scanned each other, with
hatred and enmity, twenty years' deep, in their eyes. One of the two had his foot on the heart
of the house of d'Esgrignon; the other, with a lion's strength, came forward to pluck it away.

"Your humble servant, sir," said Chesnel. "Have you made the charge?"

"Yes, sir."

"When was it made?"

"Yesterday."

"Have any steps been taken since the warrant of arrest was issued?"

"I believe so."

"I have come to treat with you."

"Justice must take its course, nothing can stop it, the arrest has been made."

"Never mind that, I am at your orders, at your feet." The old man knelt before du Croisier,
and stretched out his hands entreatingly.

"What do you want? Our lands, our castle? Take all; withdraw the charge; leave us nothing but
life and honor. And over and besides all this, I will be your servant; command and I will obey."

Du Croisier sat down in an easy-chair and left the old man to kneel.

"You are not vindictive," pleaded Chesnel; "you are good-hearted, you do not bear us such a
grudge that you will not listen to terms. Before daylight the young man ought to be at liberty."

"The whole town knows that he has been arrested," returned du Croisier, enjoying his revenge.

"It is a great misfortune, but as there will be neither proofs nor trial, we can easily manage
that."

Du Croisier reflected. He seemed to be struggling with self-interest; Chesnel thought that
he had gained a hold on his enemy through the great motive of human action. At that supreme
moment Mme. du Croisier appeared.

"Come here and help me to soften your dear husband, madame?" said Chesnel, still on his knees.
Mme. du Croisier made him rise with every sign of profound astonishment. Chesnel explained
his errand; and when she knew it, the generous daughter of the intendants of the Ducs de Alencon
turned to du Croisier with tears in her eyes.

"Ah! monsieur, can you hesitate? The d'Esgrignons, the honor of the province!" she said.

"There is more in it than that," exclaimed du Croisier, rising to begin his restless walk again.

"More? What more?" asked Chesnel in amazement.

"France is involved, M. Chesnel! It is a question of the country, of the people, of giving
my lords your nobles a lesson, and teaching them that there is such a thing as justice, and
law, and a bourgeoisie--a lesser nobility as good as they, and a match for them! There shall
be no more trampling down half a score of wheat fields for a single hare; no bringing shame
on families by seducing unprotected girls; they shall not look down on others as good as they
are, and mock at them for ten whole years, without finding out at last that these things swell
into avalanches, and those avalanches will fall and crush and bury my lords the nobles. You
want to go back to the old order of things. You want to tear up the social compact, the Charter
in which our rights are set forth---"

"And so?"

"Is it not a sacred mission to open the people's eyes?" cried du Croisier. "Their eyes will
be opened to the morality of your party when they see nobles going to be tried at the Assize
Court like Pierre and Jacques. They will say, then, that small folk who keep their self-respect
are as good as great folk that bring shame on themselves. The Assize Court is a light for all
the world. Here, I am the champion of the people, the friend of law. You yourselves twice flung
me on the side of the people--once when you refused an alliance, twice when you put me under
the ban of your society. You are reaping as you have sown."

If Chesnel was startled by this outburst, so no less was Mme. du Croisier. To her this was
a terrible revelation of her husband's character, a new light not merely on the past but on
the future as well. Any capitulation on the part of the colossus was apparently out of the
question; but Chesnel in no wise retreated before the impossible.

"What, monsieur?" said Mme. du Croisier. "Would you not forgive? Then you are not a Christian."

"I forgive as God forgives, madame, on certain conditions."

"And what are they?" asked Chesnel, thinking that he saw a ray of hope.

"The elections are coming on; I want the votes at your disposal."

"You shall have them."

"I wish that we, my wife and I, should be received familiarly every evening, with an appearance
of friendliness at any rate, by M. le Marquis d'Esgrignon and his circle," continued du Croisier.

"I do not know how we are going to compass it, but you shall be received."

"I wish to have the family bound over by a surety of four hundred thousand francs, and by a
written document stating the nature of the compromise, so as to keep a loaded cannon pointed
at its heart."

"We agree," said Chesnel, without admitting that the three hundred thousand francs was in his
possession; "but the amount must be deposited with a third party and returned to the family
after your election and repayment."

"No; after the marriage of my grand-niece, Mlle. Duval. She will very likely have four million
francs some day; the reversion of our property (mine and my wife's) shall be settled upon her
by her marriage-contract, and you shall arrange a match between her and the young Count."

"Never!"

"Never!" repeated du Croisier, quite intoxicated with triumph. "Good-night!"

"Idiot that I am," thought Chesnel, "why did I shrink from a lie to such a man?"

Du Croisier took himself off; he was pleased with himself; he had enjoyed Chesnel's humiliation;
he had held the destinies of a proud house, the representatives of the aristocracy of the province,
suspended in his hand; he had set the print of his heel on the very heart of the d'Esgrignons;
and, finally, he had broken off the whole negotiation on the score of his wounded pride. He
went up to his room, leaving his wife alone with Chesnel. In his intoxication, he saw his victory
clear before him. He firmly believed that the three hundred thousand francs had been squandered;
the d'Esgrignons must sell or mortgage all that they had to raise the money; the Assize Court
was inevitable to his mind.

An affair of forgery can always be settled out of court in France if the missing amount is
returned. The losers by the crime are usually well-to-do, and have no wish to blight an imprudent
man's character. But du Croisier had no mind to slacken his hold until he knew what he was
about. He meditated until he fell asleep on the magnificent manner in which his hopes would
be fulfilled by the way of the Assize Court or by marriage. The murmur of voices below, the
lamentations of Chesnel and Mme. du Croisier, sounded sweet in his ears.

Mme. du Croisier shared Chesnel's views of the d'Esgrignons. She was a deeply religious woman,
a Royalist attached to the noblesse; the interview had been in every way a cruel shock to her
feelings. She, a staunch Royalist, had heard the roaring of that Liberalism, which, in her
director's opinion, wished to crush the Church. The Left benches for her meant the popular
upheaval and the scaffolds of 1793.

"What would your uncle, that sainted man who hears us, say to this?" exclaimed Chesnel. Mme.
du Croisier made no reply, but the great tears rolled down her checks.

"You have already been the cause of one poor boy's death; his mother will go mourning all her
days," continued Chesnel; he saw how his words told, but he would have struck harder and even
broken this woman's heart to save Victurnien. "Do you want to kill Mlle. Armande, for she would
not survive the dishonor of the house for a week? Do you wish to be the death of poor Chesnel,
your old notary? For I shall kill the Count in prison before they shall bring the charge against
him, and take my own life afterwards, before they shall try me for murder in an Assize Court."

"That is enough! that is enough, my friend! I would do anything to put a stop to such an affair;
but I never knew M. du Croisier's real character until a few minutes ago. To you I can make
the admission: there is nothing to be done."

"But what if there is?"

"I would give half the blood in my veins that it were so," said she, finishing her sentence
by a wistful shake of the head.

As the First Consul, beaten on the field of Marengo till five o'clock in the evening, by six
o'clock saw the tide of battle turned by Desaix's desperate attack and Kellermann's terrific
charge, so Chesnel in the midst of defeat saw the beginnings of victory. No one but a Chesnel,
an old notary, an ex-steward of the manor, old Maitre Sorbier's junior clerk, in the sudden
flash of lucidity which comes with despair, could rise thus, high as a Napoleon, nay, higher.
This was not Marengo, it was Waterloo, and the Prussians had come up; Chesnel saw this, and
was determined to beat them off the field.

"Madame," he said, "remember that I have been your man of business for twenty years; remember
that if the d'Esgrignons mean the honor of the province, you represent the honor of the bourgeoisie;
it rests with you, and you alone, to save the ancient house. Now, answer me; are you going
to allow dishonor to fall on the shade of your dead uncle, on the d'Esgrignons, on poor Chesnel?
Do you want to kill Mlle. Armande weeping yonder? Or do you wish to expiate wrongs done to
others by a deed which will rejoice your ancestors, the intendants of the dukes of Alencon,
and bring comfort to the soul of our dear Abbe? If he could rise from his grave, he would command
you to do this thing that I beg of you upon my knees."

"What is it?" asked Mme. du Croisier.

"Well. Here are the hundred thousand crowns," said Chesnel, drawing the bundles of notes from
his pocket. "Take them, and there will be an end of it."

"If that is all," she began, "and if no harm can come of it to my husband----"

"Nothing but good," Chesnel replied. "You are saving him from eternal punishment in hell, at
the cost of a slight disappointment here below."

"He will not be compromised, will he?" she asked, looking into Chesnel's face.

Then Chesnel read the depths of the poor wife's mind. Mme. du Croisier was hesitating between
her two creeds; between wifely obedience to her husband as laid down by the Church, and obedience
to the altar and the throne. Her husband, in her eyes, was acting wrongly, but she dared not
blame him; she would fain save the d'Esgrignons, but she was loyal to her husband's interests.

"Not in the least," Chesnel answered; "your old notary swears it by the Holy Gospels----"

He had nothing left to lose for the d'Esgrignons but his soul; he risked it now by this horrible
perjury, but Mme. du Croisier must be deceived, there was no other choice but death. Without
losing a moment, he dictated a form of receipt by which Mme. du Croisier acknowledged payment
of a hundred thousand crowns five days before the fatal letter of exchange appeared; for he
recollected that du Croisier was away from home, superintending improvements on his wife's
property at the time.

"Now swear to me that you will declare before the examining magistrate that you received the
money on that date," he said, when Mme. du Croisier had taken the notes and he held the receipt
in his hand.

"It will be a lie, will it not?"

"Venial sin," said Chesnel.

"I could not do it without consulting my director, M. l'Abbe Couturier."

"Very well," said Chesnel, "will you be guided entirely by his advice in this affair?"

"I promise that."

"And you must not give the money to M. du Croisier until you have been before the magistrate."

"No. Ah! God give me strength to appear in a Court of Justice and maintain a lie before men!"

Chesnel kissed Mme. du Croisier's hand, then stood upright, and majestic as one of the prophets
that Raphael painted in the Vatican.

"You uncle's soul is thrilled with joy," he said; "you have wiped out for ever the wrong that
you did by marrying an enemy of altar and throne"--words that made a lively impression on Mme.
du Croisier's timorous mind.

Then Chesnel all at once bethought himself that he must make sure of the lady's director, the
Abbe Couturier. He knew how obstinately devout souls can work for the triumph of their views
when once they come forward for their side, and wished to secure the concurrence of the Church
as early as possible. So he went to the Hotel d'Esgrignon, roused up Mlle. Armande, gave her
an account of that night's work, and sped her to fetch the Bishop himself into the forefront
of the battle.

"Ah, God in heaven! Thou must save the house of d'Esgrignon!" he exclaimed, as he went slowly
home again. "The affair is developing now into a fight in a Court of Law. We are face to face
with men that have passions and interests of their own; we can get anything out of them. This
du Croisier has taken advantage of the public prosecutor's absence; the public prosecutor is
devoted to us, but since the opening of the Chambers he has gone to Paris. Now, what can they
have done to get round his deputy? They have induced him to take up the charge without consulting
his chief. This mystery must be looked into, and the ground surveyed to-morrow; and then, perhaps,
when I have unraveled this web of theirs, I will go back to Paris to set great powers at work
through Mme. de Maufrigneuse."

So he reasoned, poor, aged, clear-sighted wrestler, before he lay down half dead with bearing
the weight of so much emotion and fatigue. And yet, before he fell asleep he ran a searching
eye over the list of magistrates, taking all their secret ambitions into account, casting about
for ways of influencing them, calculating his chances in the coming struggle. Chesnel's prolonged
scrutiny of consciences, given in a condensed form, will perhaps serve as a picture of the
judicial world in a country town.

Magistrates and officials generally are obliged to begin their career in the provinces; judicial
ambition there ferments. At the outset every man looks towards Paris; they all aspire to shine
in the vast theatre where great political causes come before the courts, and the higher branches
of the legal profession are closely connected with the palpitating interests of society. But
few are called to that paradise of the man of law, and nine-tenths of the profession are bound
sooner or later to regard themselves as shelved for good in the provinces. Wherefore, every
Tribunal of First Instance and every Court-Royal is sharply divided in two. The first section
has given up hope, and is either torpid or content; content with the excessive respect paid
to office in a country town, or torpid with tranquillity. The second section is made up of
the younger sort, in whom the desire of success is untempered as yet by disappointment, and
of the really clever men urged on continually by ambition as with a goad; and these two are
possessed with a sort of fanatical belief in their order.

At this time the younger men were full of Royalist zeal against the enemies of the Bourbons.
The most insignificant deputy official was dreaming of conducting a prosecution, and praying
with all his might for one of those political cases which bring a man's zeal into prominence,
draw the attention of the higher powers, and mean advancement for King's men. Was there a member
of an official staff of prosecuting counsel who could hear of a Bonapartist conspiracy breaking
out somewhere else without a feeling of envy? Where was the man that did not burn to discover
a Caron, or a Berton, or a revolt of some sort? With reasons of State, and the necessity of
diffusing the monarchical spirit throughout France as their basis, and a fierce ambition stirred
up whenever party spirit ran high, these ardent politicians on their promotion were lucid,
clear-sighted, and perspicacious. They kept up a vigorous detective system throughout the kingdom;
they did the work of spies, and urged the nation along a path of obedience, from which it had
no business to swerve.

Justice, thus informed with monarchical enthusiasm, atoned for the errors of the ancient parliaments,
and walked, perhaps, too ostentatiously hand in hand with religion. There was more zeal than
discretion shown; but justice sinned not so much in the direction of machiavelism as by giving
the candid expression to its views, when those views appeared to be opposed to the general
interests of a country which must be put safely out of reach of revolutions. But taken as a
whole, there was still too much of the bourgeois element in the administration; it was too
readily moved by petty liberal agitation; and as a result, it was inevitable that it should
incline sooner or later to the Constitutional party, and join ranks with the bourgeoisie in
the day of battle. In the great body of legal functionaries, as in other departments of the
administration, there was not wanting a certain hypocrisy, or rather that spirit of imitation
which always leads France to model herself on the Court, and, quite unintentionally, to deceive
the powers that be.

Officials of both complexions were to be found in the court in which young d'Esgrignon's fate
depended. M. le President du Ronceret and an elderly judge, Blondet by name, represented the
section of functionaries shelved for good, and resigned to stay where they were; while the
young and ambitious party comprised the examining magistrate M. Camusot, and his deputy M.
Michu, appointed through the interests of the Cinq-Cygnes, and certain of promotion to the
Court of Appeal of Paris at the first opportunity.

President du Ronceret held a permanent post; it was impossible to turn him out. The aristocratic
party declined to give him what he considered to be his due, socially speaking; so he declared
for the bourgeoisie, glossed over his disappointment with the name of independence, and failed
to realize that his opinions condemned him to remain a president of a court of the first instance
for the rest of his life. Once started in this track the sequence of events led du Ronceret
to place his hopes of advancement on the triumph of du Croisier and the Left. He was in no
better odor at the Prefecture than at the Court-Royal. He was compelled to keep on good terms
with the authorities; the Liberals distrusted him, consequently he belonged to neither party.
He was obliged to resign his chances of election to du Croisier, he exercised no influence,
and played a secondary part. The false position reacted on his character; he was soured and
discontented; he was tired of political ambiguity, and privately had made up his mind to come
forward openly as leader of the Liberal party, and so to strike ahead of du Croisier. His behavior
in the d'Esgrignon affair was the first step in this direction. To begin with, he was an admirable
representative of that section of the middle classes which allows its petty passions to obscure
the wider interests of the country; a class of crotchety politicians, upholding the government
one day and opposing it the next, compromising every cause and helping none; helpless after
they have done the mischief till they set about brewing more; unwilling to face their own incompetence,
thwarting authority while professing to serve it. With a compound of arrogance and humility
they demand of the people more submission than kings expect, and fret their souls because those
above them are not brought down to their level, as if greatness could be little, as if power
existed without force.

President du Ronceret was a tall, spare man with a receding forehead and scanty, auburn hair.
He was wall-eyed, his complexion was blotched, his lips thin and hard, his scarcely audible
voice came out like the husky wheezings of asthma. He had for a wife a great, solemn, clumsy
creature, tricked out in the most ridiculous fashion, and outrageously overdressed. Mme. la
Presidente gave herself the airs of a queen; she wore vivid colors, and always appeared at
balls adorned with the turban, dear to the British female, and lovingly cultivated in out-of-the-way
districts in France. Each of the pair had an income of four or five thousand francs, which
with the President's salary, reached a total of some twelve thousand. In spite of a decided
tendency to parsimony, vanity required that they should receive one evening in the week. Du
Croisier might import modern luxury into the town, M. and Mme. de Ronceret were faithful to
the old traditions. They had always lived in the old-fashioned house belonging to Mme. du Ronceret,
and had made no changes in it since their marriage. The house stood between a garden and a
courtyard. The gray old gable end, with one window in each story, gave upon the road. High
walls enclosed the garden and the yard, but the space taken up beneath them in the garden by
a walk shaded with chestnut trees was filled in the yard by a row of outbuildings. An old rust-devoured
iron gate in the garden wall balanced the yard gateway, a huge, double-leaved carriage entrance
with a buttress on either side, and a mighty shell on the top. The same shell was repeated
over the house-door.

The whole place was gloomy, close, and airless. The row of iron-gated openings in the opposite
wall, as you entered, reminded you of prison windows. Every passer-by could look in through
the railings to see how the garden grew; the flowers in the little square borders never seemed
to thrive there.

The drawing-room on the ground floor was lighted by a single window on the side of the street,
and a French window above a flight of steps, which gave upon the garden. The dining-room on
the other side of the great ante-chamber, with its windows also looking out into the garden,
was exactly the same size as the drawing-room, and all three apartments were in harmony with
the general air of gloom. It wearied your eyes to look at the ceilings all divided up by huge
painted crossbeams and adorned with a feeble lozenge pattern or a rosette in the middle. The
paint was old, startling in tint, and begrimed with smoke. The sun had faded the heavy silk
curtains in the drawing-room; the old-fashioned Beauvais tapestry which covered the white-painted
furniture had lost all its color with wear. A Louis Quinze clock on the chimney-piece stood
between two extravagant, branched sconces filled with yellow wax candles, which the Presidente
only lighted on occasions when the old-fashioned rock-crystal chandelier emerged from its green
wrapper. Three card-tables, covered with threadbare baize, and a backgammon box, sufficed for
the recreations of the company; and Mme. du Ronceret treated them to such refreshments as cider,
chestnuts, pastry puffs, glasses of eau sucree, and home-made orgeat. For some time past she
had made a practice of giving a party once a fortnight, when tea and some pitiable attempts
at pastry appeared to grace the occasion.

Once a quarter the du Roncerets gave a grand three-course dinner, which made a great sensation
in the town, a dinner served up in execrable ware, but prepared with the science for which
the provincial cook is remarkable. It was a Gargantuan repast, which lasted for six whole hours,
and by abundance the President tried to vie with du Croisier's elegance.

And so du Ronceret's life and its accessories were just what might have been expected from
his character and his false position. He felt dissatisfied at home without precisely knowing
what was the matter; but he dared not go to any expense to change existing conditions, and
was only too glad to put by seven or eight thousand francs every year, so as to leave his son
Fabien a handsome private fortune. Fabien du Ronceret had no mind for the magistracy, the bar,
or the civil service, and his pronounced turn for doing nothing drove his parent to despair.

On this head there was rivalry between the President and the Vice-President, old M. Blondet.
M. Blondet, for a long time past, had been sedulously cultivating an acquaintance between his
son and the Blandureau family. The Blandureaus were well-to-do linen manufacturers, with an
only daughter, and it was on this daughter that the President had fixed his choice of a wife
for Fabien. Now, Joseph Blondet's marriage with Mlle. Blandureau depended on his nomination
to the post which his father, old Blondet, hoped to obtain for him when he himself should retire.
But President du Ronceret, in underhand ways, was thwarting the old man's plans, and working
indirectly upon the Blandureaus. Indeed, if it had not been for this affair of young d'Esgrignon's,
the astute President might have cut them out, father and son, for their rivals were very much
richer.

M. Blondet, the victim of the machiavelian President's intrigues, was one of the curious figures
which lie buried away in the provinces like old coins in a crypt. He was at that time a man
of sixty-seven or thereabouts, but he carried his years well; he was very tall, and in build
reminded you of the canons of the good old times. The smallpox had riddled his face with numberless
dints, and spoilt the shape of his nose by imparting to it a gimlet-like twist; it was a countenance
by no means lacking in character, very evenly tinted with a diffused red, lighted up by a pair
of bright little eyes, with a sardonic look in them, while a certain sarcastic twitch of the
purpled lips gave expression to that feature.

Before the Revolution broke out, Blondet senior had been a barrister; afterwards he became
the public accuser, and one of the mildest of those formidable functionaries. Goodman Blondet,
as they used to call him, deadened the force of the new doctrines by acquiescing in them all,
and putting none of them in practice. He had been obliged to send one or two nobles to prison;
but his further proceedings were marked with such deliberation, that he brought them through
to the 9th Thermidor with a dexterity which won respect for him on all sides. As a matter of
fact, Goodman Blondet ought to have been President of the Tribunal, but when the courts of
law were reorganized he had been set aside; Napoleon's aversion for Republicans was apt to
reappear in the smallest appointments under his government. The qualification of ex-public
accuser, written in the margin of the list against Blondet's name, set the Emperor inquiring
of Cambaceres whether there might not be some scion of an ancient parliamentary stock to appoint
instead. The consequence was that du Ronceret, whose father had been a councillor of parliament,
was nominated to the presidency; but, the Emperor's repugnance notwithstanding, Cambaceres
allowed Blondet to remain on the bench, saying that the old barrister was one of the best jurisconsults
in France.

Blondet's talents, his knowledge of the old law of the land and subsequent legislation, should
by rights have brought him far in his profession; but he had this much in common with some
few great spirits: he entertained a prodigious contempt for his own special knowledge, and
reserved all his pretentions, leisure, and capacity for a second pursuit unconnected with the
law. To this pursuit he gave his almost exclusive attention. The good man was passionately
fond of gardening. He was in correspondence with some of the most celebrated amateurs; it was
his ambition to create new species; he took an interest in botanical discoveries, and lived,
in short, in the world of flowers. Like all florists, he had a predilection for one particular
plant; the pelargonium was his especial favorite. The court, the cases that came before it,
and his outward life were as nothing to him compared with the inward life of fancies and abundant
emotions which the old man led. He fell more and more in love with his flower-seraglio; and
the pains which he bestowed on his garden, the sweet round of the labors of the months, held
Goodman Blondet fast in his greenhouse. But for that hobby he would have been a deputy under
the Empire, and shone conspicuous beyond a doubt in the Corps Legislatif.

His marriage was the second cause of his obscurity. As a man of forty, he was rash enough to
marry a girl of eighteen, by whom he had a son named Joseph in the first year of their marriage.
Three years afterwards Mme. Blondet, then the prettiest woman in the town, inspired in the
prefect of the department a passion which ended only with her death. The prefect was the father
of her second son Emile; the whole town knew this, old Blondet himself knew it. The wife who
might have roused her husband's ambition, who might have won him away from his flowers, positively
encouraged the judge in his botanical tastes. She no more cared to leave the place than the
prefect cared to leave his prefecture so long as his mistress lived.

Blondet felt himself unequal at his age to a contest with a young wife. He sought consolation
in his greenhouse, and engaged a very pretty servant-maid to assist him to tend his ever-changing
bevy of beauties. So while the judge potted, pricked out, watered, layered, slipped, blended,
and induced his flowers to break, Mme. Blondet spent his substance on the dress and finery
in which she shone at the prefecture. One interest alone had power to draw her away from the
tender care of a romantic affection which the town came to admire in the end; and this interest
was Emile's education. The child of love was a bright and pretty boy, while Joseph was no less
heavy and plain-featured. The old judge, blinded by paternal affection loved Joseph as his
wife loved Emile.

For a dozen years M. Blondet bore his lot with perfect resignation. He shut his eyes to his
wife's intrigue with a dignified, well-bred composure, quite in the style of an eighteenth
century grand seigneur; but, like all men with a taste for a quiet life, he could cherish a
profound dislike, and he hated his younger son. When his wife died, therefore, in 1818, he
turned the intruder out of the house, and packed him off to Paris to study law on an allowance
of twelve hundred francs for all resource, nor could any cry of distress extract another penny
from his purse. Emile Blondet would have gone under if it had not been for his real father.

M. Blondet's house was one of the prettiest in the town. It stood almost opposite the prefecture,
with a neat little court in front. A row of old-fashioned iron railings between two brick-work
piers enclosed it from the street; and a low wall, also of brick, with a second row of railings
along the top, connected the piers with the neighboring house. The little court, a space about
ten fathoms in width by twenty in length, was cut in two by a brick pathway which ran from
the gate to the house door between a border on either side. Those borders were always renewed;
at every season of the year they exhibited a successful show of blossom, to the admiration
of the public. All along the back of the gardenbeds a quantity of climbing plants grew up and
covered the walls of the neighboring houses with a magnificent mantle; the brick-work piers
were hidden in clusters of honeysuckle; and, to crown all, in a couple of terra-cotta vases
at the summit, a pair of acclimatized cactuses displayed to the astonished eyes of the ignorant
those thick leaves bristling with spiny defences which seem to be due to some plant disease.

It was a plain-looking house, built of brick, with brick-work arches above the windows, and
bright green Venetian shutters to make it gay. Through the glass door you could look straight
across the house to the opposite glass door, at the end of a long passage, and down the central
alley in the garden beyond; while through the windows of the dining-room and drawing-room,
which extended, like the passage from back to front of the house, you could often catch further
glimpses of the flower-beds in a garden of about two acres in extent. Seen from the road, the
brick-work harmonized with the fresh flowers and shrubs, for two centuries had overlaid it
with mosses and green and russet tints. No one could pass through the town without falling
in love with a house with such charming surroundings, so covered with flowers and mosses to
the roof-ridge, where two pigeons of glazed crockery ware were perched by way of ornament.

M. Blondet possessed an income of about four thousand livres derived from land, besides the
old house in the town. He meant to avenge his wrongs legitimately enough. He would leave his
house, his lands, his seat on the bench to his son Joseph, and the whole town knew what he
meant to do. He had made a will in that son's favor; he had gone as far as the Code will permit
a man to go in the way of disinheriting one child to benefit another; and what was more, he
had been putting by money for the past fifteen years to enable his lout of a son to buy back
from Emile that portion of his father's estate which could not legally be taken away from him.

Emile Blondet thus turned adrift had contrived to gain distinction in Paris, but so far it
was rather a name than a practical result. Emile's indolence, recklessness, and happy-go-lucky
ways drove his real father to despair; and when that father died, a half-ruined man, turned
out of office by one of the political reactions so frequent under the Restoration, it was with
a mind uneasy as to the future of a man endowed with the most brilliant qualities.

Emile Blondet found support in a friendship with a Mlle. de Troisville, whom he had known before
her marriage with the Comte de Montcornet. His mother was living when the Troisvilles came
back after the emigration; she was related to the family, distantly it is true, but the connection
was close enough to allow her to introduce Emile to the house. She, poor woman, foresaw the
future. She knew that when she died her son would lose both mother and father, a thought which
made death doubly bitter, so she tried to interest others in him. She encouraged the liking
that sprang up between Emile and the eldest daughter of the house of Troisville; but while
the liking was exceedingly strong on the young lady's part, a marriage was out of the question.
It was a romance on the pattern of Paul et Virginie. Mme. Blondet did what she could to teach
her son to look to the Troisvilles, to found a lasting attachment on a children's game of "make-believe"
love, which was bound to end as boy-and-girl romances usually do. When Mlle. de Troisville's
marriage with General Montcornet was announced, Mme. Blondet, a dying woman, went to the bride
and solemnly implored her never to abandon Emile, and to use her influence for him in society
in Paris, whither the General's fortune summoned her to shine.

Luckily for Emile, he was able to make his own way. He made his appearance, at the age of twenty,
as one of the masters of modern literature; and met with no less success in the society into
which he was launched by the father who at first could afford to bear the expense of the young
man's extravagance. Perhaps Emile's precocious celebrity and the good figure that he made strengthened
the bonds of his friendship with the Countess. Perhaps Mme. de Montcornet, with the Russian
blood in her veins (her mother was the daughter of the Princess Scherbelloff), might have cast
off the friend of her childhood if he had been a poor man struggling with all his might among
the difficulties which beset a man of letters in Paris; but by the time that the real strain
of Emile's adventurous life began, their attachment was unalterable on either side. He was
looked upon as one of the leading lights of journalism when young d'Esgrignon met him at his
first supper party in Paris; his acknowledged position in the world of letters was very high,
and he towered above his reputation. Goodman Blondet had not the faintest conception of the
power which the Constitutional Government had given to the press; nobody ventured to talk in
his presence of the son of whom he refused to hear. And so it came to pass that he knew nothing
of Emile whom he had cursed and Emile's greatness.

Old Blondet's integrity was as deeply rooted in him as his passion for flowers; he knew nothing
but law and botany. He would have interviews with litigants, listen to them, chat with them,
and show them his flowers; he would accept rare seeds from them; but once on the bench, no
judge on earth was more impartial. Indeed, his manner of proceeding was so well known, that
litigants never went near him except to hand over some document which might enlighten him in
the performance of his duty, and nobody tried to throw dust in his eyes. With his learning,
his lights, and his way of holding his real talents cheap, he was so indispensable to President
du Ronceret, that, matrimonial schemes apart, that functionary would have done all that he
could, in an underhand way, to prevent the vice-president from retiring in favor of his son.
If the learned old man left the bench, the President would be utterly unable to do without him.

Goodman Blondet did not know that it was in Emile's power to fulfil all his wishes in a few
hours. The simplicity of his life was worthy of one of Plutarch's men. In the evening he looked
over his cases; next morning he worked among his flowers; and all day long he gave decisions
on the bench. The pretty maid-servant, now of ripe age, and wrinkled like an Easter pippin,
looked after the house, and they lived according to the established customs of the strictest
parsimony. Mlle. Cadot always carried the keys of her cupboards and fruit-loft about with her.
She was indefatigable. She went to market herself, she cooked and dusted and swept, and never
missed mass of a morning. To give some idea of the domestic life of the household, it will
be enough to remark that the father and son never ate fruit till it was beginning to spoil,
because Mlle. Cadot always brought out anything that would not keep. No one in the house ever
tasted the luxury of new bread, and all the fast days in the calendar were punctually observed.
The gardener was put on rations like a soldier; the elderly Valideh always kept an eye upon
him. And she, for her part, was so deferentially treated, that she took her meals with the
family, and in consequence was continually trotting to and fro between the kitchen and the
parlor at breakfast and dinner time.

Mlle. Blandureau's parents had consented to her marriage with Joseph Blondet upon one condition--the
penniless and briefless barrister must be an assistant judge. So, with the desire of fitting
his son to fill the position, old M. Blondet racked his brains to hammer the law into his son's
head by dint of lessons, so as to make a cut-and-dried lawyer of him. As for Blondet junior,
he spent almost every evening at the Blandureaus' house, to which also young Fabien du Ronceret
had been admitted since his return, without raising the slightest suspicion in the minds of
father or son.

Everything in this life of theirs was measured with an accuracy worthy of Gerard Dow's Money
Changer; not a grain of salt too much, not a single profit foregone; but the economical principles
by which it was regulated were relaxed in favor of the greenhouse and garden. "The garden was
the master's craze," Mlle. Cadot used to say. The master's blind fondness for Joseph was not
a craze in her eyes; she shared the father's predilection; she pampered Joseph; she darned
his stockings; and would have been better pleased if the money spent on the garden had been
put by for Joseph's benefit.

That garden was kept in marvelous order by a single man; the paths, covered with river-sand,
continually turned over with the rake, meandered among the borders full of the rarest flowers.
Here were all kinds of color and scent, here were lizards on the walls, legions of little flower-pots
standing out in the sun, regiments of forks and hoes, and a host of innocent things, a combination
of pleasant results to justify the gardener's charming hobby.

At the end of the greenhouse the judge had set up a grandstand, an amphitheatre of benches
to hold some five or six thousand pelargoniums in pots--a splendid and famous show. People
came to see his geraniums in flower, not only from the neighborhood, but even from the departments
round about. The Empress Marie Louise, passing through the town, had honored the curiously
kept greenhouse with a visit; so much was she impressed with the sight, that she spoke of it
to Napoleon, and the old judge received the Cross of the Legion of Honor. But as the learned
gardener never mingled in society at all, and went nowhere except to the Blandureaus, he had
no suspicion of the President's underhand manoeuvres; and others who could see the President's
intentions were far too much afraid of him to interfere or to warn the inoffensive Blondets.

As for Michu, that young man with his powerful connections gave much more thought to making
himself agreeable to the women in the upper social circles to which he was introduced by the
Cinq-Cygnes, than to the extremely simple business of a provincial Tribunal. With his independent
means (he had an income of twelve thousand livres), he was courted by mothers of daughters,
and led a frivolous life. He did just enough at the Tribunal to satisfy his conscience, much
as a schoolboy does his exercises, saying ditto on all occasions, with a "Yes, dear President."
But underneath the appearance of indifference lurked the unusual powers of the Paris law student
who had distinguished himself as one of the staff of prosecuting counsel before he came to
the provinces. He was accustomed to taking broad views of things; he could do rapidly what
the President and Blondet could only do after much thinking, and very often solved knotty points
for them. In delicate conjunctures the President and Vice-President took counsel with their
junior, confided thorny questions to him, and never failed to wonder at the readiness with
which he brought back a task in which old Blondet found nothing to criticise. Michu was sure
of the influence of the most crabbed aristocrats, and he was young and rich; he lived, therefore,
above the level of departmental intrigues and pettinesses. He was an indispensable man at picnics,
he frisked with young ladies and paid court to their mothers, he danced at balls, he gambled
like a capitalist. In short, he played his part of young lawyer of fashion to admiration; without,
at the same time, compromising his dignity, which he knew how to assert at the right moment
like a man of spirit. He won golden opinions by the manner in which he threw himself into provincial
ways, without criticising them; and for these reasons, every one endeavored to make his time
of exile endurable.

The public prosecutor was a lawyer of the highest ability; he had taken the plunge into political
life, and was one of the most distinguished speakers on the ministerialist benches. The President
stood in awe of him; if he had not been away in Paris at the time, no steps would have been
taken against Victurnien; his dexterity, his experience of business, would have prevented the
whole affair. At that moment, however, he was in the Chamber of Deputies, and the President
and du Croisier had taken advantage of his absence to weave their plot, calculating, with a
certain ingenuity, that if once the law stepped in, and the matter was noised abroad, things
would have gone too far to be remedied.

As a matter of fact, no staff of prosecuting counsel in any Tribunal, at that particular time,
would have taken up a charge of forgery against the eldest son of one of the noblest houses
in France without going into the case at great length, and a special reference, in all probability,
to the Attorney-General. In such a case as this, the authorities and the Government would have
tried endless ways of compromising and hushing up an affair which might send an imprudent young
man to the hulks. They would very likely have done the same for a Liberal family in a prominent
position, so long as the Liberals were not too openly hostile to the throne and the altar.
So du Croisier's charge and the young Count's arrest had not been very easy to manage. The
President and du Croisier had compassed their ends in the following manner.

M. Sauvager, a young Royalist barrister, had reached the position of deputy public prosecutor
by dint of subservience to the Ministry. In the absence of his chief he was head of the staff
of counsel for prosecution, and, consequently, it fell to him to take up the charge made by
du Croisier. Sauvager was a self-made man; he had nothing but his stipend; and for that reason
the authorities reckoned upon some one who had everything to gain by devotion. They visited museums
and manufactories, during which expeditions they were taught to observe, criticise, and find defects.
This was the first step taken in France in the eighteenth century toward a modern education.
Although it was superficial, in consequence of its great breadth, yet this education inculcated
manliness and courage.

In 1778 Mme. de Genlis published her moral teachings in Adèle et Théodore,
a work which created quite a little talk at the time, but which eventually
brought upon her the condemnation of the philosophers and Encyclopædists,
because in it she opposed liberty of conscience.

When, on the occasion of the first communion of the Duc de Valois, she wrote her Religion Considered
as the Only True Foundation of Happiness and of True Philosophy, all the Palais-Royal place hunters,
philosophers, and her political enemies, in a mass, opposed and ridiculed
her.

Rivarol declared that she had no sex, that heaven had refused the magic of talent to her productions,
as it had refused the charm of innocence to her childhood.

One of the best portraits of her is in the memoirs of the Baroness d'Oberkirch (it was she who disturbed Mme. de
Genlis and the Duc d'Orléans while they were walking in the gardens one night):

"I did not like her, in spite of her accomplishments and the charm of her conversation; she was too
systematic. She is a woman who has laid aside the flowing robes of her sex for the costume of a pedagogue.
Besides, nothing about her is natural; she is constantly in an attitude, as it were, thinking
that her portrait—physical or moral—is being taken by someone. One of the great follies of this masculine woman
is her harp, which she carries about with her; she speaks about it when
she hasn't it—she plays on a crust of bread and practises with a thread.
When she perceives that someone is looking at her, she rounds her
arm, purses up her mouth, assumes a sentimental expression and air,
and begins to move her fingers. Gracious! what a fine thing naturalness
is!... I spent a delightful evening at the Comtesse de La Massais's;
she had hired musicians whom she paid dear; but Mme. de Genlis sat
in the centre of the assembly, commanded, talked, commented, sang,
and would have put the entire concert in confusion, had not the Marquise
de Livry very drolly picked a quarrel with her about her harp, which
she had brought to her.

Decidedly, this young D'Orléans has a singular governor.

She holds too closely to her rôle, and never forgets her jupons [skirts] except when she ought most
to remember them."

During her visit to England she was petted by everyone; but even in
England there was a widespread prejudice against her—a feeling which
the mere sight of her immediately dissipated.

An English lady wrote about her:

"I saw her at first with a prejudice in her disfavor, from the cruel reports I had heard; but the moment
I looked at her it was removed.

There was a dignity with her sweetness and a frankness with her modesty,
that convinced me, beyond all power of contrary report, of her real
worth and innocence."

During the Revolution Mme. de Genlis travelled about Switzerland, Germany,
and England.

At Berlin, owing to her poverty, she supported herself by writing, making
trinkets, and teaching, until she was recalled to France, under the
Consulate.

In Paris she produced some of her best works—although they were written
to order.

Napoleon
gave her a pension of six thousand francs and handsome apartments at the Arsenal. To this liberal
pension, the wife of his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, added three thousand
francs.

From Mme. de Genlis, Napoleon received a letter fortnightly, in which
epistle she communicated to him her opinions and observations upon politics
and current events. Upon the return to power of the Orléans family,
she was put off with a meagre pension.

Like many other French women, she became more and more melancholy and misanthropic. She was unable to control
her wrath against the philosophers and some of the contemporary writers,
such as Lamartine, Mme. de Staël, Scott, and Byron.

Her death, in 1830, was announced in these words: "Mme. de Genlis has
ceased to write—which is to announce her death."

Throughout life she was so generous that as soon as she received her pensions, presents, or earnings
from her work, the money was distributed among the poor. When she died, she left nothing but
a few worn and homely dresses and articles of furniture. The diversity of her works and her conduct,
the politics in which she was steeped, the satires, the perfidious accusations that have pursued
her, have contributed to leave of her a rather doubtful portrait;
however, those who have written bitterly against her have done so
mostly from personal or political animosity.

She was so many-sided—a reformer, teacher, pietist, politician, actress—that a true estimate of
her character is difficult. A woman of all tastes and of various talents, she was a living encyclopædia
and mistress of all arts of pleasing. She had studied medicine, and took special delight in the art of
bleeding, which she practised upon the peasants, each one of whom she would present with thirty
sous (thirty cents), after the bleeding—and she never lacked patients. Mme. de Genlis was an expert rider
and huntress; also, she was graceful, with an elegant figure, great
affability, and a talent for quickly and accurately reading character;
and these gifts were stepping-stones to popularity.

She wrote incessantly, on all things, essaying every style, every subject. "She has discoursed for the
education of princes and of lackeys; prepared maxims for the throne and precepts for the pantry; you
might say she possessed the gift of universality. She was gifted with a singular confidence in her
own abilities, infinite curiosity, untiring industry, and never-ending and inexhaustible energy.
She wrote nearly as much as Voltaire, and barely excelled him in
the amount of unreadable work, which, if printed, would fill over
one hundred volumes."

"Let us remember," says Mr. Dobson, "her indefatigable industry and
untiring energy, her kindness to her relatives and admirers, her courage
and patience when in exile and poverty, her great talent, perseverance,
and rare facility."

In protesting vigorously against the universal neglect of physical
development, against the absence of the gymnasium and the lack of
practical knowledge in the education of her time, in advocating the
study of modern languages as a means of culture and discipline, in
applying to her pupils the principles of the modern experimental and
observational education, Mme. de Genlis will retain a place as one
of the great female educators—as a woman pedagogue, par excellence,
of the eighteenth century.

A great number of minor salons existed, which were partly literary, partly
social. From about 1750 to 1780 the amusements varied constantly,
from all-day parties in the country to cafés served by the great
women themselves, from playing proverbs to playing synonyms, from
impromptu compositions to questionable stories, from laughter to tears,
from Blind-man's-buff to Lotto.

Some of the proverbs were quite ingenious and required elaborate preparations; for example, at one place
Mme. de Lauzun dances with M. de Belgunce, in the simplest kind of a costume, which represented
the proverb: Bonne renommée vaut mieux que ceinture dorée [A good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches]. Mme. de Marigny danced with M. de Saint-Julien as a negro, passing her handkerchief
over her face in the various figures of the dance, meaning A laver la tête d'un More on perd sa lessive
[To wash a blackamoor white].

Among the social salons, the finest was the Temple of the Prince de Conti and
his mistress, the Countess de Boufflers.

It was a salon of pleasure, liberty, and unceremonious intimacy; his thés à l'anglaise were served
by the great ladies themselves, attired in white aprons.

The exclusive and élite of the social world made up his company. The most
elegant assembly was that of the Maréchale de Luxembourg; it will be
considered later on.

The salon of Mme.
de Beauvau rivalled that of the Maréchale de Luxembourg; she was mistress
of elegance and propriety, an authority on and model of the usages
of society. A manner perhaps superior to that of any other woman,
gave Mme. de Beauvau a particular politesse and constituted her one
of the women who contributed most to the acceptance of Paris as the
capital of Europe, by well-bred people of all countries.

Her politesse was kind and without sarcasm, and, by her own naturalness, she communicated ease. She was
not beautiful, but had a frank and open expression and a marvellous
gift of conversation, which was her delight and in which she gloried.

Her salon was conspicuous for its untarnished honor and for the example
it set of a pure conjugal love.

The salon of Mme. de Grammont, at Versailles, was visited at all hours
of the day and night by the highest officials, princes, lords, and
ladies.

It had activity, authority, the secret doors, veiled and redoubtable depths of a salon of the
mistress of a king.

Everybody went there for counsel, submitted plans, and confided projects to this lady who had willingly
exiled herself from Paris.

The house of M. de La Popelinière, at Passy, was noted for its unique entertainment;
there the celebrated Gossec and Gaïffre conducted the concerts, Deshayes,
master of the ballet at the Comédie-Italienne, managed the amusements.

It was a house like a theatre and with all the requisites of the latter; there artists and men of
letters, virtuosos and danseuses, ate, slept, and lodged as in a
hotel.

With Mme. de Blot, mistress of the Duke of Orléans, as hostess, the Palais-Royal ranked next to the
Temple of the Prince de Conti; it was open only to those who were presented; after that ceremony,
all those who were thus introduced could, without invitation, dine there on all days of the Grand
Opera. On the petits jours a select twenty gathered, who, when once invited, were so for all time. The
"Salon de Pomone," of Mme. de Marchais, received its name from Mme. du Deffand on account of the
exquisite fruits and magnificent flowers which the hostess cultivated
and distributed among her friends.

"La Paroisse," of Mme. Doublet de Persan, was the salon of the sceptics and
was under the constant surveillance of the police.

All the members arrived at the same time and each took possession of the
armchair reserved for him, above which hung his portrait. On a large
stand were two registers, in which the rumors of the day were noted—in
one the doubtful, in the other the accredited. On Saturday, a selection
was made, which went to the Grand Livre, which became a journal entitled
Nouvelles à la Main, kept by the valet-de-chambre of Mme.

Doublet. This book furnished the substance of the six volumes of the Mémoires Secrets, which began to
appear in 1770.

Besides these salons of the nobility, there were those of the financiers,
a profession which had risen into prominence within the last half
century, after the death of Louis XIV.

According to the Goncourt brothers, the greatest of these salons
was that of Mme. de Grimrod de La Reynière, who, by dint of shrewd
manœuvring, by unheard-of extravagances, excessive opulence in the
furnishings of her salon, and by the most gorgeous and rare fêtes
and suppers, had succeeded in attracting to her establishment a number
of the court and nobility.

The salon of M. de La Popelinière belonged to this class, although he was
ranked, more or less, among the nobility. There were the weekly suppers
of Mme. Suard, Mme. Saurin, the Abbé Raynal, and the luncheons of the
Abbé Morellet on the first Sunday of the month; to the latter functions
were invited all the celebrities of the other salons, as well as artists
and musicians—it was there that the famous quarrel of the Gluck
and Piccini parties originated.

The
Tuesday dinners of Helvétius became famous; it was at them that Franklin
was one of the favorites; after the death of Helvétius, he attempted
in vain to put an end to the widowhood of madame.

No man at that time was more popular than Franklin or had as much public
attention shown him.

There were a number of celebrated women whose reputations rest mainly
on their wit and conversational abilities; they may be classed as
society leaders, to distinguish them from salon leaders.

Chapter X

Social Classes

The belief generally prevails that devotion and constancy did not exist among French women of the
eighteenth century; but, in spite of the very numerous instances of infidelity which dot the pages
of the history of the French matrimonial relations of those days, many examples
of rare devotion are found, even among the nobility. Love of the king
and self-eliminating devotion to him were feelings to which women
aspired; yet we have one countess, the Countess of Perigord, who,
true to her wifehood, repels the advances of the king, preferring
a voluntary exile to the dishonor of a life of royal favors and attentions.

There is also the example of Mme. de Trémoille; having been stricken
with smallpox, she was ministered to by her husband, who voluntarily shared her
fate and died with her.

It would seem that the highest types of devotion are to be found in
the families of the ministers and men of state, where the wife was
intimately associated with the fortune and the success of her husband.

The Marquis de Croisy and his wife were married forty years; M. and Mme. de Maurepas lived together for
fifty years, without being separated one day. Instances are many in which reconciliations were effected
after years of unfaithfulness; these seldom occurred, however, until
the end of life was near.

The
normal type of married life among the higher classes still remained one of most ideal and beautiful
devotion, in spite of the great number of exceptions.

It must be observed that in the middle class the young girl grew up
with the mother and was given her most tender care; surrounded with
wholesome influences, she saw little or nothing of the world, and,
the constant companion of her mother, developed much like the average
young girl of to-day.

At the age of about eleven she was sent to a convent, where—after having spent some time in the pension,
where instruction in religion was given her—she was instructed by
the sisters for one year.

After her confirmation and her first communion, and the home visits to
all the relatives, she was placed in a maison religieuse, where the
sisters taught the daughters of the common people free of charge.
The young girl was also taught dancing, music, and other accomplishments
of a like nature, but there was nothing of the feverish atmosphere
of the convent in which the daughters of the nobility were reared;
these institutions for the middle classes were peaceful, silent, and
calm, fostering a serenity and quietude.

The days passed quickly, the Sundays being eagerly looked forward to because of the visits of
the parents, who took their daughters for drives and walks and indulged them in other innocent diversions.
Such a life had its after effects: the young girls grew up with a taste for system, discipline,
piety, and for a rigid devotion, which often led them to an instinctive
need of doctrine and sacrifice; consequently, in later life many
turned to Jansenism.

However, the young girls of this class who were not thus educated, because
their assistance was required at home, received an early training in social
as well as in domestic affairs; they had a solid and practical, if
uncouth, foundation, combined with a worldly and, often, a frivolous
temperament.

To them many privileges were opened: they were taken to the opera, to concerts
and to balls, to the salons of painting, and it often happened that they
developed a craving for the society to which only the nobly born demoiselle
was admitted.

When this craving went too far, it frequently led to seduction by
some of the chevaliers who make seduction a profession.

     The marriage customs in these circles differed little from those of to-day. The
suitor asked permission to call and to continue his visits; then followed the period
of present giving. The young girl was almost always absolute mistress of the
decision; if the father presented a name, the daughter insisted upon seeing,
receiving, and becoming intimately acquainted with the suitor, a
custom quite different from that practised among the nobility.

Instead of giving her rights as it did the girl of the nobility, marriage
imposed duties upon the girl of the middle class; it closed the world
instead of opening it to her; it ended her brilliant, gay, and easy
life, instead of beginning it, as was the case in the higher classes.

This she realized, therefore hesitated long before taking the final step which was to bind
her until death.

With her, becoming a wife meant infinitely more than it did to the
girl of the nobility; her husband had the management of her money,
and his vices were visited upon her and her children—in short, he
became her master in all things.

These disadvantages she was taught to consider deeply before entering
the marriage state.

This state of affairs developed distinctive physiognomies in the different
classes of the middle-class society: thus, "the wives of the financiers
are dignified, stern, severe; those of the merchants are seductive,
active, gossiping, and alert; those of the artists are free, easy,
and independent, with a strong taste for pleasure and gayety—and they
give the tone."

As we approach the end of the century, the bourgeoisie begins to assume
the airs, habits, extravagances, and even the immoralities, of the higher
classes.

Below the bourgeoise was the workingwoman, whose ideas were limited to those of
a savage and who was a woman only in sex. Her ideas of morality, decency, conjugal
happiness, children, education, were limited by quarrels, profanity,
blows, fights. At that time brandy was the sole consolation for those
women; it supplied their moral force and their moral resistance,
making them forget cold, hunger, fatigue, evil, and giving them courage
and patience; it was the fire that sustained, comforted, and incited
them.

These women were not much above the level of animals, but from them,
we find, often sprang the entertainers of the time, the queens of beauty
and gallantry—Laguerre, D'Hervieux, Sophie Arnould. Having lost
their virtue with maturity, these women had no sense of morality; in them,
nothing preserved the sense of honor—their religion consisted of a few
superstitious practices.

The constituents of duty and the virtue of women they could only vaguely
guess; marriage itself was presented to them under the most repugnant
image of constant contention.

It was in such an atmosphere as this that the daughters of these women grew
up. Their talents found opportunity for display at the public dances where
some of them would in time attract especial attention. Some became opera singers,
dancers, or actresses, and were very popular; others became influential,
and, through the efforts of some lover, allured about them a circle
of ambitious débauchés or aspirants for social favors.

Through their adventures they made their way up in the world to high society.

From
this element of prostitution was disentangled, to a large extent,
the great gallantry of the eighteenth century.

This was accomplished by adding an elegance to debauch, by clothing vice
with a sort of grandeur, and by adorning scandal with a semblance
of the glory and grace of the courtier of old. Possessing the fascination
of all gifts, prodigalities, follies, with all the appetites and
tendencies of the time, these women attracted the society of the period—the
poets, the artists, even the scientists, the philosophers, and the
nobility.

Their reputation increased with the number
and standing of their lovers. The genius of the eighteenth century circled
about these street belles—they represented the fortune of pleasure.

As the church would not countenance the marriage of an actress, she was
forced to renounce the theatre when she would marry, but once married
a permit to return to the stage was easily obtained. Society was not
so severe as the laws; it received actresses, sought out, and even
adored them; it received the women of the stage as equals, and many of them
were married by counts and dukes, given a title, and presented at court.
The regular type of the prostitute was tolerated and even received by
society; "a word of anger, malediction, or outrage, was seldom raised against
these women: on the contrary, pity and the commiseration of charity
and tenderness were felt for them and manifested." This was natural, for
many of them—through notoriety—reached society and, as mistresses of
the king, even the throne itself. "If such women as Mme. de Pompadour
were esteemed, what principles remained in the name of which to judge
without pity and to condemn the débauchés of the street," says Mme.
de Choiseul, one of the purest of women.

This class usually created and established the styles. There is a striking
contrast between the standards of beauty and fashions of the respective
periods of Louis XIV. and Louis XV.: "The stately figure, rich costume,
awe-inspiring peruke of the magnificent Louis XIV.—the satins, velvets,
embroideries, perfumes, and powder of the indolent and handsome Louis
XV., well illustrate the two epochs." The beauty of the Louis XIV. age
was more serious, more imposing, imperial, classic; later in the eighteenth
century, under Louis XV., she developed into a charming figure of finesse,
sveltesse et gracilité, with an extremely delicate complexion, a small
mouth and thin nose, as opposed to the strong, plump mouth and nez
léonin (leonine nose). More animated, the face was all movement,
the eyes talked; the esprit passed to the face. It was the type of Marivaux'
comedies, with an esprit mobile, animated and colored by all the
coquetries of grace.

Later in the century, the very opposite type prevailed; the aspiration
then became to leave an emotion ungratified rather than to seduce;
a languishing expression was cultivated; women sought to sweeten the
physiognomy, to make it tender and mild. The style of beauty changed
from the brunette with brown eyes—so much in vogue under Louis XV., to
the blonde with blue eyes under Louis XVI. Even the red which formerly
"dishonored France," became a favorite.
Well and good; now not only has there not been the slightest imprudence, but we are innocent
victims caught in a trap."

"I am curious to know how," said the examining magistrate.

"For the last two years, the Sieur du Croisier has regularly allowed M. le Comte d'Esgrignon
to draw upon him for very large sums," said Chesnel. "We are going to produce drafts for more
than a hundred thousand crowns, which he continually met; the amounts being remitted by me--bear
that well in mind--either before or after the bills fell due. M. le Comte d'Esgrignon is in
a position to produce a receipt for the sum paid by him, before this bill, this alleged forgery
was drawn. Can you fail to see in that case that this charge is a piece of spite and party
feeling? And a charge brought against the heir of a great house by one of the most dangerous
enemies of the Throne and Altar, what is it but an odious slander? There has been no more forgery
in this affair than there has been in my office. Summon Mme. du Croisier, who knows nothing
as yet of the charge of forgery; she will declare to you that I brought the money and paid
it over to her, so that in her husband's absence she might remit the amount for which he has
not asked her. Examine du Croisier on the point; he will tell you that he knows nothing of
my payment to Mme. du Croisier.

"You may make such assertions as these, sir, in M. d'Esgrignon's salon, or in any other house
where people know nothing of business, and they may be believed; but no examining magistrate,
unless he is a driveling idiot, can imagine that a woman like Mme. du Croisier, so submissive
as she is to her husband, has a hundred thousand crowns lying in her desk at this moment, without
saying a word to him; nor yet that an old notary would not have advised M. du Croisier of the
deposit on his return to town."

"The old notary, sir, had gone to Paris to put a stop to the young man's extravagance."

"I have not yet examined the Comte d'Esgrignon," Camusot began; "his answers will point out
my duty."

"Is he in close custody?"

"Yes."

"Sir," said Chesnel, seeing danger ahead, "the examination can be made in our interests or
against them. But there are two courses open to you: you can establish the fact on Mme. du
Croisier's deposition that the amount was deposited with her before the bill was drawn; or
you can examine the unfortunate young man implicated in this affair, and he in his confusion
may remember nothing and commit himself. You will decide which is the more credible--a slip
of memory on the part of a woman in her ignorance of business, or a forgery committed by a
d'Esgrignon."

"All this is beside the point," began Camusot; "the question is, whether M. le Comte d'Esgrignon
has or has not used the lower half of a letter addressed to him by du Croisier as a bill of
exchange."

"Eh! and so he might," a voice cried suddenly, as Mme. Camusot broke in, followed by the handsome
stranger, "so he might when M. Chesnel had advanced the money to meet the bill----"

She leant over her husband.

"You will have the first vacant appointment as assistant judge at Paris, you are serving the
King himself in this affair; I have proof of it; you will not be forgotten," she said, lowering
her voice in his ear. "This young man that you see here is the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse; you
must never have seen her, and do all that you can for the young Count boldly."

"Gentlemen," said Camusot, "even if the preliminary examination is conducted to prove the young
Count's innocence, can I answer for the view the court may take? M. Chesnel, and you also,
my sweet, know what M. le President wants."

"Tut, tut, tut!" said Mme. Camusot, "go yourself to M. Michu this morning, and tell him that
the Count has been arrested; you will be two against two in that case, I will be bound. Michu
comes from Paris, and you know he is devoted to the noblesse. Good blood cannot lie."

At that very moment Mlle. Cadot's voice was heard in the doorway. She had brought a note, and
was waiting for an answer. Camusot went out, and came back again to read the note aloud:

"M. le Vice-President begs M. Camusot to sit in audience to-day and for the next few days,
so that there may be a quorum during M. le President's absence."

"Then there is an end of the preliminary examination!" cried Mme. Camusot. "Did I not tell
you, dear, that they would play you some ugly trick? The President has gone off to slander
you to the public prosecutor and the President of the Court-Royal. You will be changed before
you can make the examination. Is that clear?"

"You will stay, monsieur," said the Duchess. "The public prosecutor is coming, I hope, in time."

"When the public prosecutor arrives," little Mme. Camusot said, with some heat, "he must find
all over.--Yes, my dear, yes," she added, looking full at her amazed husband.--"Ah! old hypocrite
of a President, you are setting your wits against us; you shall remember it! You have a mind
to help us to a dish of your own making, you shall have two served up to you by your humble
servant Cecile Amelie Thirion!--Poor old Blondet! It is lucky for him that the President has
taken this journey to turn us out, for now that great oaf of a Joseph Blondet will marry Mlle.
Blandureau. I will let Father Blondet have some seeds in return.--As for you, Camusot, go to
M. Michu's, while Mme. la Duchesse and I will go to find old Blondet. You must expect to hear
it said all over the town to-morrow that I took a walk with a lover this morning."

Mme. Camusot took the Duchess' arm, and they went through the town by deserted streets to avoid
any unpleasant adventure on the way to the old Vice-President's house. Chesnel meanwhile conferred
with the young Count in prison; Camusot had arranged a stolen interview. Cook-maids, servants,
and the other early risers of a country town, seeing Mme. Camusot and the Duchess taking their
way through the back streets, took the young gentleman for an adorer from Paris. That evening,
as Cecile Amelie had said, the news of her behavior was circulated about the town, and more
than one scandalous rumor was occasioned thereby. Mme. Camusot and her supposed lover found
old Blondet in his greenhouse. He greeted his colleague's wife and her companion, and gave
the charming young man a keen, uneasy glance.

"I have the honor to introduce one of my husband's cousins," said Mme. Camusot, bringing forward
the Duchess; "he is one of the most distinguished horticulturists in Paris; and as he cannot
spend more than one day with us, on his way back from Brittany, and has heard of your flowers
and plants, I have taken the liberty of coming early."

"Oh, the gentleman is a horticulturist, is he?" said the old Blondet.

The Duchess bowed.

"This is my coffee-plant," said Blondet, "and here is a tea-plant."

"What can have taken M. le President away from home?" put in Mme. Camusot. "I will wager that
his absence concerns M. Camusot."

"Exactly.--This, monsieur, is the queerest of all cactuses," he continued, producing a flower-pot
which appeared to contain a piece of mildewed rattan; "it comes from Australia. You are very
young, sir, to be a horticulturist."

"Dear M. Blondet, never mind your flowers," said Mme. Camusot. "You are concerned, you and
your hopes, and your son's marriage with Mlle. Blandureau. You are duped by the President."

"Bah!" said old Blondet, with an incredulous air.

"Yes," retorted she. "If you cultivated people a little more and your flowers a little less,
you would know that the dowry and the hopes you have sown, and watered, and tilled, and weeded
are on the point of being gathered now by cunning hands."

"Madame!----"

"Oh, nobody in the town will have the courage to fly in the President's face and warn you.
I, however, do not belong to the town, and, thanks to this obliging young man, I shall soon
be going back to Paris; so I can inform you that Chesnel's successor has made formal proposals
for Mlle. Claire Blandureau's hand on behalf of young du Ronceret, who is to have fifty thousand
crowns from his parents. As for Fabien, he has made up his mind to receive a call to the bar,
so as to gain an appointment as judge."

Old Blondet dropped the flower-pot which he had brought out for the Duchess to see.

"Oh, my cactus! Oh, my son! and Mlle. Blandureau!... Look here! the cactus flower is broken
to pieces."

"No," Mme. Camusot answered, laughing; "everything can be put right. If you have a mind to
see your son a judge in another month, we will tell you how you must set to work----"

"Step this way, sir, and you will see my pelargoniums, an enchanting sight while they are in
flower----" Then he added to Mme. Camusot, "Why did you speak of these matters while your cousin
was present."

"All depends upon him," riposted Mme. Camusot. "Your son's appointment is lost for ever if
you let fall a word about this young man."

"Bah!"

"The young man is a flower----"

"Ah!"

"He is the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, sent here by His Majesty to save young d'Esgrignon, whom
they arrested yesterday on a charge of forgery brought against him by du Croisier. Mme. la
Duchesse has authority from the Keeper of the Seals; he will ratify any promises that she makes
to us----"

"My cactus is all right!" exclaimed Blondet, peering at his precious plant.--"Go on, I am listening."

"Take counsel with Camusot and Michu to hush up the affair as soon as possible, and your son
will get the appointment. It will come in time enough to baffle du Ronceret's underhand dealings
with the Blandureaus. Your son will be something better than assistant judge; he will have
M. Camusot's post within the year. The public prosecutor will be here to-day. M. Sauvager will
be obliged to resign, I expect, after his conduct in this affair. At the court my husband will
show you documents which completely exonerate the Count and prove that the forgery was a trap
of du Croisier's own setting."

Old Blondet went into the Olympic circus where his six thousand pelargoniums stood, and made
his bow to the Duchess.

"Monsieur," said he, "if your wishes do not exceed the law, this thing may be done."

"Monsieur," returned the Duchess, "send in your resignation to M. Chesnel to-morrow, and I
will promise you that your son shall be appointed within the week; but you must not resign
until you have had confirmation of my promise from the public prosecutor. You men of law will
come to a better understanding among yourselves. Only let him know that the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse
had pledged her word to you. And not a word as to my journey hither," she added.

The old judge kissed her hand and began recklessly to gather his best flowers for her.

"Can you think of it? Give them to madame," said the Duchess. "A young man should not have
flowers about him when he has a pretty woman on his arm."

"Before you go down to the court," added Mme. Camusot, "ask Chesnel's successor about those
proposals that he made in the name of M. and Mme. du Ronceret."

Old Blondet, quite overcome by this revelation of the President's duplicity, stood planted
on his feet by the wicket gate, looking after the two women as they hurried away through by-streets
home again. The edifice raised so painfully during ten years for his beloved son was crumbling
visibly before his eyes. Was it possible? He suspected some trick, and hurried away to Chesnel's
successor.

At half-past nine, before the court was sitting, Vice-President Blondet, Camusot, and Michu
met with remarkable punctuality in the council chamber. Blondet locked the door with some precautions
when Camusot and Michu came in together.

"Well, Mr. Vice-President," began Michu, "M. Sauvager, without consulting the public prosecutor,
has issued a warrant for the apprehension of one Comte d'Esgrignon, in order to serve a grudge
borne against him by one du Croisier, an enemy of the King's government. It is a regular topsy-turvy
affair. The President, for his part, goes away, and thereby puts a stop to the preliminary
examination! And we know nothing of the matter. Do they, by any chance, mean to force our hand?"

"This is the first word I have heard of it," said the Vice-President. He was furious with the
President for stealing a march on him with the Blandureaus. Chesnel's successor, the du Roncerets'
man, had just fallen into a snare set by the old judge; the truth was out, he knew the secret.

"It is lucky that we spoke to you about the matter, my dear master," said Camusot, "or you
might have given up all hope of seating your son on the bench or of marrying him to Mlle. Blandureau."

"But it is no question of my son, nor of his marriage," said the Vice-President; "we are talking
of young Comte d'Esgrignon. Is he or is he not guilty?"

"It seems that Chesnel deposited the amount to meet the bill with Mme. du Croisier," said Michu,
"and a crime has been made of a mere irregularity. According to the charge, the Count made
use of the lower half of a letter bearing du Croisier's signature as a draft which he cashed
at the Kellers'."

"An imprudent thing to do," was Camusot's comment.

"But why is du Croisier proceeding against him if the amount was paid in beforehand?" asked
Vice-President Blondet.

"He does not know that the money was deposited with his wife; or he pretends that he does not
know," said Camusot.

"It is a piece of provincial spite," said Michu.

"Still it looks like a forgery to me," said old Blondet. No passion could obscure judicial
clear-sightedness in him.

"Do you think so?" returned Camusot. "But, at the outset, supposing that the Count had no business
to draw upon du Croisier, there would still be no forgery of the signature; and the Count believed
that he had a right to draw on Croisier when Chesnel advised him that the money had been placed
to his credit."

"Well, then, where is the forgery?" asked Blondet. "It is the intent to defraud which constitutes
forgery in a civil action."

"Oh, it is clear, if you take du Croisier's version for truth, that the signature was diverted
from its purpose to obtain a sum of money in spite of du Croisier's contrary injunction to
his bankers," Camusot answered.

"Gentlemen," said Blondet, "this seems to me to be a mere trifle, a quibble.--Suppose you had
the money, I ought perhaps to have waited until I had your authorization; but I, Comte d'Esgrignon,
was pressed for money, so I---- Come, come, your prosecution is a piece of revengeful spite.
Forgery is defined by the law as an attempt to obtain any advantage which rightfully belongs
to another. There is no forgery here, according to the letter of the Roman law, nor according
to the spirit of modern jurisprudence (always from the point of a civil action, for we are
not here concerned with the falsification of public or authentic documents). Between private
individuals the essence of a forgery is the intent to defraud; where is it in this case? In
what times are we living, gentlemen? Here is the President going away to balk a preliminary
examination which ought to be over by this time! Until to-day I did not know M. le President,
but he shall have the benefit of arrears; from this time forth he shall draft his decisions
himself. You must set about this affair with all possible speed, M. Camusot."

"Yes," said Michu. "In my opinion, instead of letting the young man out on bail, we ought to
pull him out of this mess at once. Everything turns on the examination of du Croisier and his
wife. You might summons them to appear while the court is sitting, M. Camusot; take down their
depositions before four o'clock, send in your report to-night, and we will give our decision
in the morning before the court sits."

"We will settle what course to pursue while the barristers are pleading," said Vice-President
Blondet, addressing Camusot.

And with that the three judges put on their robes and went into court.

At noon Mlle. Armande and the Bishop reached the Hotel d'Esgrignon; Chesnel and M. Couturier
were there to meet them. There was a sufficiently short conference between the prelate and
Mme. du Croisier's director, and the latter set out at once to visit his charge.

At eleven o'clock that morning du Croisier received a summons to appear in the examining magistrate's
office between one and two in the afternoon. Thither he betook himself, consumed by well-founded
suspicions. It was impossible that the President should have foreseen the arrival of the Duchesse
de Maufrigneuse upon the scene, the return of the public prosecutor, and the hasty confabulation
of his learned brethren; so he had omitted to trace out a plan for du Croisier's guidance in
the event of the preliminary examination taking place. Neither of the pair imagined that the
proceedings would be hurried on in this way. Du Croisier obeyed the summons at once; he wanted
to know how M. Camusot was disposed to act. So he was compelled to answer the questions put
to him. Camusot addressed him in summary fashion with the six following inquiries:--

"Was the signature on the bill alleged to be a forgery in your handwriting?--Had you previously
done business with M. le Comte d'Esgrignon?--Was not M. le Comte d'Esgrignon in the habit of
drawing upon you, with or without advice?--Did you not write a letter authorizing M. d'Esgrignon
to rely upon you at any time?--Had not Chesnel squared the account not once, but many times
already?--Were you not away from home when this took place?"

All these questions the banker answered in the affirmative. In spite of wordy explanations,
the magistrate always brought him back to a "Yes" or "No." When the questions and answers alike
had been resumed in the proces-verbal, the examining magistrate brought out a final thunderbolt.

"Was du Croisier aware that the money destined to meet the bill had been deposited with him,
du Croisier, according to Chesnel's declaration, and a letter of advice sent by the said Chesnel
to the Comte d'Esgrignon, five days before the date of the bill?"

That last question frightened du Croisier. He asked what was meant by it, and whether he was
supposed to be the defendant and M. le Comte d'Esgrignon the plaintiff? He called the magistrate's
attention to the fact that if the money had been deposited with him, there was no ground for
the action.

"Justice is seeking information," said the magistrate, as he dismissed the witness, but not
before he had taken down du Croisier's last observation.

"But the money, sir----"

"The money is at your house."

Chesnel, likewise summoned, came forward to explain the matter. The truth of his assertions
was borne out by Mme. du Croisier's deposition. The Count had already been examined. Prompted
by Chesnel, he produced du Croisier's first letter, in which he begged the Count to draw upon
him without the insulting formality of depositing the amount beforehand. The Comte d'Esgrignon
next brought out a letter in Chesnel's handwriting, by which the notary advised him of the
deposit of a hundred thousand crowns with M. du Croisier. With such primary facts as these
to bring forward as evidence, the young Count's innocence was bound to emerge triumphantly
from a court of law.

Du Croisier went home from the court, his face white with rage, and the foam of repressed fury
on his lips. His wife was sitting by the fireside in the drawing-room at work upon a pair of
slippers for him. She trembled when she looked into his face, but her mind was made up.

"Madame," he stammered out, "what deposition is this that you made before the magistrate? You
have dishonored, ruined, and betrayed me!"

"I have saved you, monsieur," answered she. "If some day you will have the honor of connecting
yourself with the d'Esgrignons by marrying your niece to the Count, it will be entirely owing
to my conduct to-day."

"A miracle!" cried he. "Balaam's ass has spoken. Nothing will astonish me after this. And where
are the hundred thousand crowns which (so M. Camusot tells me) are here in my house?"

"Here they are," said she, pulling out a bundle of banknotes from beneath the cushions of her
settee. "I have not committed mortal sin by declaring that M. Chesnel gave them into my keeping."

"While I was away?"

"You were not here."

"Will you swear that to me on your salvation?"

"I swear it," she said composedly.

"Then why did you say nothing to me about it?" demanded he.

"I was wrong there," said his wife, "but my mistake was all for your good. Your niece will
be Marquise d'Esgrignon some of these days, and you will perhaps be a deputy, if you behave
well in this deplorable business. You have gone too far; you must find out how to get back again."

Du Croisier, under stress of painful agitation, strode up and down his drawing-room; while
his wife, in no less agitation, awaited the result of this exercise. Du Croisier at length
rang the bell.

"I am not at home to any one to-night," he said, when the man appeared; "shut the gates; and
if any one calls, tell them that your mistress and I have gone into the country. We shall start
directly after dinner, and dinner must be half an hour earlier than usual."

The great news was discussed that evening in every drawing-room; little shopkeepers, working
folk, beggars, the noblesse, the merchant class--the whole town, in short, was talking of the
Comte d'Esgrignon's arrest on a charge of forgery. The Comte d'Esgrignon would be tried in
the Assize Court; he would be condemned and branded. Most of those who cared for the honor
of the family denied the fact. At nightfall Chesnel went to Mme. Camusot and escorted the stranger
to the Hotel d'Esgrignon. Poor Mlle. Armande was expecting him; she led the fair Duchess to
her own room, which she had given up to her, for his lordship the Bishop occupied Victurnien's
chamber; and, left alone with her guest, the noble woman glanced at the Duchess with most piteous
eyes.

"You owed help, indeed, madame, to the poor boy who ruined himself for your sake," she said,
"the boy to whom we are all of us sacrificing ourselves."

The Duchess had already made a woman's survey of Mlle. d'Esgrignon's room; the cold, bare,
comfortless chamber, that might have been a nun's cell, was like a picture of the life of the
heroic woman before her. The Duchess saw it all--past, present, and future--with rising emotion,
felt the incongruity of her presence, and could not keep back the falling tears that made answer
for her.

But in Mlle. Armande the Christian overcame Victurnien's aunt. "Ah, I was wrong; forgive me,
Mme. la Duchesse; you did not know how poor we were, and my nephew was incapable of the admission.
And besides, now that I see you, I can understand all--even the crime!"

And Mlle. Armande, withered and thin and white, but beautiful as those tall austere slender
figures which German art alone can paint, had tears too in her eyes.

"Do not fear, dear angel," the Duchess said at last; "he is safe."

"Yes, but honor?--and his career? Chesnel told me; the King knows the truth."

"We will think of a way of repairing the evil," said the Duchess.

Mlle. Armande went downstairs to the salon, and found the Collection of Antiquities complete
to a man. Every one of them had come, partly to do honor to the Bishop, partly to rally round
the Marquis; but Chesnel, posted in the antechamber, warned each new arrival to say no word
of the affair, that the aged Marquis might never know that such a thing had been. The loyal
Frank was quite capable of killing his son or du Croisier; for either the one or the other
must have been guilty of death in his eyes. It chanced, strangely enough, that he talked more
of Victurnien than usual; he was glad that his son had gone back to Paris. The King would give
Victurnien a place before very long; the King was interesting himself at last in the d'Esgrignons.
And his friends, their hearts dead within them, praised Victurnien's conduct to the skies.
Mlle. Armande prepared the way for her nephew's sudden appearance among them by remarking to
her brother that Victurnien would be sure to come to see them, and that he must be even then
on his way.

"Bah!" said the Marquis, standing with his back to the hearth, "if he is doing well where he
is, he ought to stay there, and not be thinking of the joy it would give his old father to
see him again. The King's service has the first claim."

Scarcely one of those present heard the words without a shudder. Justice might give over a
d'Esgrignon to the executioner's branding iron. There was a dreadful pause. The old Marquise
de Casteran could not keep back a tear that stole down over her rouge, and turned her head
away to hide it.

Next day at noon, in the sunny weather, a whole excited population was dispersed in groups
along the high street, which ran through the heart of the town, and nothing was talked of but
the great affair. Was the Count in prison or was he not?--All at once the Comte d'Esgrignon's
well-known tilbury was seen driving down the Rue Saint-Blaise; it had evidently come from the
Prefecture, the Count himself was on the box seat, and by his side sat a charming young man,
whom nobody recognized. The pair were laughing and talking and in great spirits. They wore
Bengal roses in their button-holes. Altogether, it was a theatrical surprise which words fail
to describe.

At ten o'clock the court had decided to dismiss the charge, stating their very sufficient reasons
for setting the Count at liberty, in a document which contained a thunderbolt for du Croisier,
in the shape of an inasmuch that gave the Count the right to institute proceedings for libel.
Old Chesnel was walking up the Grand Rue, as if by accident, telling all who cared to hear
him that du Croisier had set the most shameful of snares for the d'Esgrignons' honor, and that
it was entirely owing to the forbearance and magnanimity of the family that he was not prosecuted
for slander.

On the evening of that famous day, after the Marquis d'Esgrignon had gone to bed, the Count,
Mlle. Armande, and the Chevalier were left with the handsome young page, now about to return
to Paris. The charming cavalier's sex could not be hidden from the Chevalier, and he alone,
besides the three officials and Mme. Camusot, knew that the Duchess had been among them.

"The house is saved," began Chesnel, "but after this shock it will take a hundred years to
rise again. The debts must be paid now; you must marry an heiress, M. le Comte, there is nothing
left for you to do."

"And take her where you may find her," said the Duchess.

"A second mesalliance!" exclaimed Mlle. Armande.

The Duchess began to laugh.

"It is better to marry than to die," she said. As she spoke she drew from her waistcoat pocket
a tiny crystal phial that came from the court apothecary.

Mlle. Armande shrank away in horror. Old Chesnel took the fair Maufrigneuse's hand, and kissed
it without permission.

"Are you all out of your minds here?" continued the Duchess. "Do you really expect to live
in the fifteenth century when the rest of the world has reached the nineteenth? My dear children,
there is no noblesse nowadays; there is no aristocracy left! Napoleon's Code Civil made an
end of the parchments, exactly as cannon made an end of feudal castles. When you have some
money, you will be very much more of nobles than you are now. Marry anybody you please, Victurnien,
you will raise your wife to your rank; that is the most substantial privilege left to the French
noblesse. Did not M. de Talleyrand marry Mme. Grandt without compromising his position? Remember
that Louis XIV. took the Widow Scarron for his wife."

"He did not marry her for her money," interposed Mlle. Armande. 

I hope, therefore, I shall be excused for attempting some description, slight and unskilful as
it may be, of places and scenery where the human mind has exhibited some of
its most curious and powerful features, and which awaken reflections
of the deepest interest--I allude particularly to the monastery of La Trappe,
and to the country of La Vendée. The former had dwelt among the earliest
impressions of youth, with something like the wild and wonderful
force of a romantic tale; and I was anxious to become an eye-witness
of what had so long been one of the most powerful objects of my imagination.

The gloomy and almost inaccessible situation chosen by this strange
fraternity for their convent--their rigid separation from human intercourse--the
infringible taciturnity imposed upon themselves--and the terrible
severity of their penances, are certainly circumstances more resembling
the visionary indulgence of fantasy and fiction, than actual realities
to be met with among living men, and in the present day.

With regard to the department of La Vendée, whatever serves, trivial as it may be, to recall or illustrate the history
of its wars and the character of its inhabitants, must ever possess
a charm for those who delight to sympathize with the noble struggles
of a gallant people, conscientiously devoting themselves to the cause
of a fallen and persecuted monarchy, and resisting the cruel and destructive
ferocity of a licentious enemy, who had broken down the most sacred
fences of society, and trampled upon the dearest ties of human nature.

 While peril lasted, Diane could still see her lover in the young
Count; but out of danger, she despised him for the weakling that he was.

Six months afterwards, Camusot received the appointment of assistant judge at Paris, and later
he became an examining magistrate. Goodman Blondet was made a councillor to the Royal-Court;
he held the post just long enough to secure a retiring pension, and then went back to live
in his pretty little house. Joseph Blondet sat in his father's seat at the court till the end
of his days; there was not the faintest chance of promotion for him, but he became Mlle. Blandereau's
husband; and she, no doubt, is leading to-day, in the little flower-covered brick house, as
dull a life as any carp in a marble basin. Michu and Camusot also received the Cross of the
Legion of Honor, while Blondet became an Officer. As for M. Sauvager, deputy public prosecutor,
he was sent to Corsica, to du Croisier's great relief; he had decidedly no mind to bestow his
niece upon that functionary.

Du Croisier himself, urged by President du Ronceret, appealed from the finding of the Tribunal
to the Court-Royal, and lost his cause. The Liberals throughout the department held that little
d'Esgrignon was guilty; while the Royalists, on the other hand, told frightful stories of plots
woven by "that abominable du Croisier" to compass his revenge. A duel was fought indeed; the
hazard of arms favored du Croisier, the young Count was dangerously wounded, and his antagonist
maintained his words. This affair embittered the strife between the two parties; the Liberals
brought it forward on all occasions. Meanwhile du Croisier never could carry his election,
and saw no hope of marrying his niece to the Count, especially after the duel.

A month after the decision of the Tribunal was confirmed in the Court-Royal, Chesnel died,
exhausted by the dreadful strain, which had weakened and shaken him mentally and physically.
He died in the hour of victory, like some old faithful hound that has brought the boar to bay,
and gets his death on the tusks. He died as happily as might be, seeing that he left the great
House all but ruined, and the heir in penury, bored to death by an idle life, and without a
hope of establishing himself. That bitter thought and his own exhaustion, no doubt, hastened
the old man's end. One great comfort came to him as he lay amid the wreck of so many hopes,
sinking under the burden of so many cares--the old Marquis, at his sister's entreaty, gave
him back all the old friendship. The great lord came to the little house in the Rue du Bercail,
and sat by his old servant's bedside, all unaware how much that servant had done and sacrificed
for him. Chesnel sat upright, and repeated Simeon's cry.--The Marquis allowed them to bury
Chesnel in the castle chapel; they laid him crosswise at the foot of the tomb which was waiting
for the Marquis himself, the last, in a sense, of the d'Esgrignons.

And so died one of the last representatives of that great and beautiful thing, Service; giving
to that often discredited word its original meaning, the relation between feudal lord and servitor.
That relation, only to be found in some out-of-the-way province, or among a few old servants
of the King, did honor alike to a noblesse that could call forth such affection, and to a bourgeoisie
that could conceive it. Such noble and magnificent devotion is no longer possible among us.
Noble houses have no servitors left; even as France has no longer a King, nor an hereditary
peerage, nor lands that are bound irrevocably to an historic house, that the glorious names
of the nation may be perpetuated. Chesnel was not merely one of the obscure great men of private
life; he was something more--he was a great fact. In his sustained self-devotion is there not
something indefinably solemn and sublime, something that rises above the one beneficent deed,
or the heroic height which is reached by a moment's supreme effort? Chesnel's virtues belong
essentially to the classes which stand between the poverty of the people on the one hand, and
the greatness of the aristocracy on the other; for these can combine homely burgher virtues
with the heroic ideals of the noble, enlightening both by a solid education.

Victurnien was not well looked upon at Court; there was no more chance of a great match for
him, nor a place. His Majesty steadily refused to raise the d'Esgrignons to the peerage, the
one royal favor which could rescue Victurnien from his wretched position. It was impossible
that he should marry a bourgeoise heiress in his father's lifetime, so he was bound to live
on shabbily under the paternal roof with memories of his two years of splendor in Paris, and
the lost love of a great lady to bear him company. He grew moody and depressed, vegetating
at home with a careworn aunt and a half heart-broken father, who attributed his son's condition
to a wasting malady. Chesnel was no longer there.

The Marquis died in 1830. The great d'Esgrignon, with a following of all the less infirm noblesse
from the Collection of Antiquities, went to wait upon Charles X. at Nonancourt; he paid his
respects to his sovereign, and swelled the meagre train of the fallen king. It was an act of
courage which seems simple enough to-day, but, in that time of enthusiastic revolt, it was heroism.

"The Gaul has conquered!" These were the Marquis' last words.

By that time du Croisier's victory was complete. The new Marquis d'Esgrignon accepted Mlle.
Duval as his wife a week after his old father's death. His bride brought him three millions
of francs for du Croisier and his wife settled the reversion of their fortunes upon her in
the marriage-contract. Du Croisier took occasion to say during the ceremony that the d'Esgrignon
family was the most honorable of all the ancient houses in France.

Some day the present Marquis d'Esgrignon will have an income of more than a hundred thousand
crowns. You may see him in Paris, for he comes to town every winter and leads a jolly bachelor
life, while he treats his wife with something more than the indifference of the grand seigneur
of olden times; he takes no thought whatever for her.

"As for Mlle. d'Esgrignon," said Emile Blondet, to whom all the detail of the story is due,
"if she is no longer like the divinely fair woman whom I saw by glimpses in my childhood, she
is decidedly, at the age of sixty-seven, the most pathetic and interesting figure in the Collection
of Antiquities. She queens it among them still. I saw her when I made my last journey to my
native place in search of the necessary papers for my marriage. When my father knew who it
was that I had married, he was struck dumb with amazement; he had not a word to say until I
told him that I was a prefect.

"'You were born to it,' he said, with a smile.

"As I took a walk around the town, I met Mlle. Armande. She looked taller than ever. I looked
at her, and thought of Marius among the ruins of Carthage. Had she not outlived her creed,
and the beliefs that had been destroyed? Sentiment, indeed, underlies everything that is great or
lovely or enduring on this earth. It is the joy of festivals, the animating soul of patriotism,
the bond of families, the beauty of religious, political, and social
institutions.
