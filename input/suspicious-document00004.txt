This morning it rained so hard (though it was fair yesterday, and we thereupon in hopes of
having some fair weather, which we have wanted these three months) that it wakened Creed, who
lay with me last night, and me, and so we up and fell to discourse of the business of his accounts
now under dispute, in which I have taken much trouble upon myself and raised a distance between
Sir G. Carteret and myself, which troubles me, but I hope we have this morning light on an
expedient that will right all, that will answer their queries, and yet save Creed the L500
which he did propose to make of the exchange abroad of the pieces of eight which he disbursed.
Being ready, he and I by water to White Hall, where I left him before we came into the Court,
for fear I should be seen by Sir G. Carteret with him, which of late I have been forced to
avoid to remove suspicion.  Thence by water with Sir W. Batten to Trinity House, there to dine
with him, which we did; and after dinner we fell talking, Sir J. Minnes, Mr. Batten and I;
Mr. Batten telling us of a late triall of Sir Charles Sydly  the other day, before my Lord
Chief Justice Foster and the whole bench, for his debauchery a little while since at Oxford Kate's,

     [The details in the original are very gross.  The woman known as Oxford Kate appears to have
     kept the notorious Cock Tavern in Bow Street at this date.]

coming in open day into the Balcone and showed his nakedness, .  .  .  . and abusing of scripture
and as it were from thence preaching a mountebank sermon from the pulpit, saying that there
he had to sell such a powder as should make all the [women] in town run after him, 1000 people
standing underneath to see and hear him, and that being done he took a glass of wine .  . 
.  .  and then drank it off, and then took another and drank the King's health.  Thence home,
and my clerks being gone by my leave to see the East India ships that are lately come home,
I staid all alone within my office all the afternoon.  I received this morning a letter from
my wife, brought by John Gower to town, wherein I find a sad falling out between my wife and
my father and sister and Ashwell upon my writing to my father to advise Pall not to keep Ashwell
from her mistress, or making any difference between them.  Which Pall telling to Ashwell, and
she speaking some words that her mistress heard, caused great difference among them; all which
I am sorry from my heart to hear of, and I fear will breed ill blood not to be laid again.
So that I fear my wife and I may have some falling out about it, or at least my father and
I, but I shall endeavour to salve up all as well as I can, or send for her out of the country
before the time intended, which I would be loth to do.  In the evening by water to my coz.
Roger Pepys' chamber, where he was not come, but I found Dr. John newly come to town, and is
well again after his sickness; but, Lord! what a simple man he is as to any public matter of
state, and talks so sillily to his brother Dr. Tom.  What the matter is I know not, but he
has taken (as my father told me a good while since) such displeasure that he hardly would touch
his hat to me, and I as little to him. Thence to my brother's, and being vexed with his not
minding my father's business here in getting his Landscape done, I went away in an anger, and
walked home, and so up to my lute and then to bed.

2d.  Up betimes to my office, and there all the morning doing business, at noon to the Change,
and there met with several people, among others Captain Cox, and with him to a Coffee [House],
and drank with him and some other merchants.  Good discourse.  Thence home and to dinner, and,
after a little alone at my viol, to the office, where we sat all the afternoon, and so rose
at the evening, and then home to supper and to bed, after a little musique.  My mind troubled
me with the thoughts of the difference between my wife and my father in the country.  So home
and to my musique; and then comes Mr. Creed to me giving me an account of his accounts, how
he has now settled them fit for perusal the most strict, at which I am glad.  So he and I to
bed together.

3d.  Thence to the Change, and meeting Sir J. Minnes there, he and I walked to look upon Backwell's
design of making another alley from his shop through over against the Exchange door, which
will be very noble and quite put down the other two.

So home to dinner and then to the office, and entered in my manuscript book the Victualler's
contract, and then over the water and walked to see Sir W. Pen, and sat with him a while, and
so home late, and to my viall. So up comes Creed again to me and stays all night, to-morrow
morning being a hearing before the Duke.  So to bed full of discourse of his business.

4th.  Up by 4 o'clock and sent him to get matters ready, and I to my office looking over papers
and mending my manuscript by scraping out the blots and other things, which is now a very fine
book.  So to St. James's by water with Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten, I giving occasion to
a wager about the tide, that it did flow through bridge, by which Sir W. Batten won 5s. of
Sir J. Minnes.  At St. James's we staid while the Duke made himself ready.  The Duke being
ready, we retired with him, and there fell upon Mr. Creed's business, where the Treasurer did,
like a mad coxcomb, without reason or method run over a great many things against the account,
and so did Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten, which the Duke himself and Mr. Coventry and my
Lord Barkely and myself did remove, and Creed being called in did answer all with great method
and excellently to the purpose (myself I am a little conscious did not speak so well as I purposed
and do think I used to do, that is, not so intelligibly and persuasively, as I well hoped I
should), not that what I said was not well taken, and did carry the business with what was
urged and answered by Creed and Mr. Coventry, till the Duke himself did declare that he was
satisfied, and my Lord Barkely offered to lay L100 that the King would receive no wrong in
the account, and the two last knights held their tongues, or at least by not understanding
it did say what made for Mr. Creed, and so Sir G. Carteret was left alone, but yet persisted
to say that the account was not good, but full of corruption and foul dealing. And so we broke
up to his shame, but I do fear to the loss of his friendship to me a good while, which I am
heartily troubled for.

5th (Lord's day).  Lady Batten had sent twice to invite me to go with them to Walthamstow to-day,
Mrs. Martha' being married already this morning to Mr. Castle, at this parish church.  I could
not rise soon enough to go with them, but got myself ready, and so to Games's, where I got
a horse and rode thither very pleasantly, only coming to make water I found a stopping, which
makes me fearful of my old pain.  Being come thither, I was well received, and had two pair
of gloves, as the rest, and walked up and down with my Lady in the garden, she mighty kind
to me, and I have the way to please her.  A good dinner and merry, but methinks none of the
kindness nor bridall respect between the bridegroom and bride, that was between my wife and
I, but as persons that marry purely for convenience. After dinner to church by coach, and there
my Lady, Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Lemon, and I only, we, in spite to one another, kept one another
awake; and sometimes I read in my book of Latin plays, which I took in my pocket, thinking
to have walked it.  An old doting parson preached.  So home again, and by and by up and homewards,
calling in our way (Sir J. Minnes and I only) at Mr. Batten's (who with his lady and child
went in another coach by us), which is a very pretty house, and himself in all things within
and without very ingenious, and I find a very fine study and good books.  So set out, Sir J.
Minnes and I in his coach together, talking all the way of chymistry, wherein he do know something,
at least, seems so to me, that cannot correct him, Mr. Batten's man riding my horse, and so
home and to my office a while to read my vows, then home to prayers and to bed.

6th.  At noon Creed comes to me, who tells me how well he has sped with Sir G. Carteret after
all our trouble, that he had his tallys up and all the kind words possible from him, which
I believe is out of an apprehension what a fool he has made of himself hitherto in making so
great a stop therein.  But I find, and so my Lord Sandwich may, that Sir G. Carteret had a
design to do him a disgrace, if he could possibly, otherwise he would never have carried the
business so far after that manner, but would first have consulted my Lord and given him advice
what to do therein for his own honour, which he thought endangered.  Creed dined with me and
then walked a while, and so away, and I to my office at my morning's work till dark night,
and so with good content home.  To supper, a little musique, and then to bed.

7th.  Up by 4 o'clock and to my office, and there continued all the morning upon my Navy book
to my great content.  At noon down by barge with Sir J. Minnes (who is going to Chatham) to
Woolwich, in our way eating of some venison pasty in the barge, I having neither eat nor drank
to-day, which fills me full of wind.  Thence walked alone, only part of the way Deane walked
with me, complaining of many abuses in the Yard, to Greenwich, and so by water to Deptford,
where I found Mr. Coventry, and with him up and down all the stores, to the great trouble of
the officers, and by his help I am resolved to fall hard to work again, as I used to do.  So
thence he and I by water talking of many things, and I see he puts his trust most upon me in
the Navy, and talks, as there is reason, slightly of the two old knights, and I should be glad
by any drudgery to see the King's stores and service looked to as they ought, but I fear I
shall never understand half the miscarriages and tricks that the King suffers by.  So home,
and late at my office.  Thence home and to my musique.  This night Mr. Turner's house being
to be emptied out of my cellar, and therefore I think to sit up a little longer than ordinary.
This afternoon, coming from the waterside with Mr. Coventry, I spied my boy upon Tower Hill
playing with the rest of the boys; so I sent W. Griffin to take him, and he did bring him to
me, and so I said nothing to him, but caused him to be stripped (for he was run away with his
best suit), and so putting on his other, I sent him going, without saying one word hard to
him, though I am troubled for the rogue, though he do not deserve it.  Being come home I find
my stomach not well for want of eating to-day my dinner as I should do, and so am become full
of wind.  I called late for some victuals, and so to bed, leaving the men below in the cellar
emptying the vats up through Mr. Turner's own house, and so with more content to bed late.

8th.  Being weary, and going to bed late last night, I slept till 7 o'clock, it raining mighty
hard, and so did every minute of the day after sadly.  But I know not what will become of the
corn this year, we having had but two fair days these many months.  Up and to my office, where
all the morning busy, and then at noon home to dinner alone upon a good dish of eeles, given
me by Michell, the Bewpers' man, and then to my viall a little, and then down into the cellar
and up and down with Mr. Turner to see where his vault may be made bigger, or another made
him, which I think may well be.  And so to my office, where very busy all day setting things
in order my contract books and preparing things against the next sitting. In the evening I
received letters out of the country, among others from my wife, who methinks writes so coldly
that I am much troubled at it, and I fear shall have much ado to bring her to her old good
temper.  So home to supper and musique, which is all the pleasure I have of late given myself,
or is fit I should, others spending too much time and money.  Going in I stepped to Sir W.
Batten, and there staid and talked with him (my Lady being in the country), and sent for some
lobsters, and Mrs. Turner came in, and did bring us an umble pie hot out of her oven, extraordinary
good, and afterwards some spirits of her making, in which she has great judgment, very good,
and so home, merry with this night's refreshment.

9th.  Up.  Making water this morning, which I do every morning as soon as I am awake, with
greater plenty and freedom than I used to do, which I think I may impute to last night's drinking
of elder spirits.  Abroad, it raining, to Blackfriars, and there went into a little alehouse
and staid while I sent to the Wardrobe, but Mr. Moore was gone out.  Here I kissed three or
four times the maid of the house, who is a pretty girl, but very modest, and, God forgive me,
had a mind to something more.  Thence to my lawyer's; up and down to the Six Clerks' Office,
where I found my bill against Tom Trice dismissed, which troubles me, it being through my neglect,
and will put me to charges.  So to Mr. Phillips, and discoursed with him about finding me out
somebody that will let me have for money an annuity of about L100 per annum for two lives.
So home, and there put up my riding things against the evening, in case Mr. Moore should continue
his mind to go to Oxford, which I have little mind to do, the weather continuing so bad and
the waters high.  Dined at home, and Mr. Moore in the afternoon comes to me and concluded not
to go.  Sir W. Batten and I sat a little this afternoon at the office, and thence I by water
to Deptford, and there mustered the Yard, purposely, God forgive me, to find out Bagwell, a
carpenter, whose wife is a pretty woman, that I might have some occasion of knowing him and
forcing her to come to the office again, which I did so luckily that going thence he and his
wife did of themselves meet me in the way to thank me for my old kindness, but I spoke little
to her, but shall give occasion for her coming to me.  Her husband went along with me to show
me Sir W. Pen's lodging, which I knew before, but only to have a time of speaking to him and
sounding him.  So left and I went in to Sir W. Pen, who continues ill, and worse, I think,
than before.  He tells me my Lady Castlemaine was at Court, for all this talk this week, which
I am glad to hear; but it seems the King is stranger than ordinary to her. Thence walked home
as I used to do, and to bed presently, having taken great cold in my feet by walking in the
dirt this day in thin shoes or some other way, so that I begun to be in pain, and with warm
clothes made myself better by morning, but yet in pain.

10th.  Up to the Lobby, and there sent out for Mr. Coventry and Sir W. Batten, and told them
if they thought convenient I would go to Chatham today, Sir John Minnes being already there
at a Pay, and I would do such and such business there, which they thought well of, and so I
went home and prepared myself to go after, dinner with Sir W. Batten.  2d.  That Dunkirke was
also sold by his advice chiefly, so much to the damage of England. 3d.  After dinner I took
boat (H. Russell) and down to Gravesend in good time, and thence with a guide post to Chatham,
where I found Sir J. Minnes and Mr. Wayth walking in the garden, whom I told all this day's
news, which I left the town full of, and it is great news, and will certainly be in the consequence
of it.  By and by to supper, and after long discourse, Sir J. Minnes and I, he saw me to my
chamber, which not pleasing me, I sent word so to Mrs. Bradford, that I should be crowded into
such a hole, while the clerks and boarders of her own take up the best rooms.  However I lay
there and slept well.

11th.  Up early and to the Dock, and with the Storekeeper and other officers all the morning
from one office to another.  At noon to the Hill-house in Commissioner Pett's coach, and after
seeing the guard-ships, to dinner, and after dining done to the Dock by coach, it raining hard,
to see "The Prince" launched, which hath lain in the Dock in repairing these three years. 
I went into her and was launched in her. Thence by boat ashore, it raining, and I went to Mr.
Barrow's, where Sir J. Minnes and Commissioner Pett; we staid long eating sweetmeats and drinking,
and looking over some antiquities of Mr. Barrow's, among others an old manuscript Almanac,
that I believe was made for some monastery, in parchment, which I could spend much time upon
to understand.  Here was a pretty young lady, a niece of Barrow's, which I took much pleasure
to look on.  Thence by barge to St. Mary Creek; where Commissioner Pett (doubtful of the growing
greatness of Portsmouth by the finding of those creeks there), do design a wett dock at no
great charge, and yet no little one; he thinks towards L10,000.  And the place, indeed, is
likely to be a very fit place, when the King hath money to do it with.  Thence, it raining
as hard as it could pour down, home to the Hillhouse, and anon to supper, and after supper,
Sir J. Minnes and I had great discourse with Captain Cox and Mr. Hempson about business of
the yard, and particularly of pursers' accounts with Hempson, who is a cunning knave in that
point. So late to bed and, Mr. Wayth being gone, I lay above in the Treasurer's bed and slept
well.  About one or two in the morning the curtains of my bed being drawn waked me, and I saw
a man stand there by the inside of my bed calling me French dogg 20 times, one after another,
and I starting, as if I would get out of the bed, he fell a-laughing as hard as he could drive,
still calling me French dogg, and laid his hand on my shoulder. At last, whether I said anything
or no I cannot tell, but I perceived the man, after he had looked wistly upon me, and found
that I did not answer him to the names that he called me by, which was Salmon, Sir Carteret's
clerk, and Robt. Maddox, another of the clerks, he put off his hat on a suddaine, and forebore
laughing, and asked who I was, saying, "Are you Mr. Pepys?" I told him yes, and now being come
a little better to myself, I found him to be Tom Willson, Sir W. Batten's clerk, and fearing
he might be in some melancholy fit, I was at a loss what to do or say. At last I asked him
what he meant.  He desired my pardon for that he was mistaken, for he thought verily, not knowing
of my coming to lie there, that it had been Salmon, the Frenchman, with whom he intended to
have made some sport.  So I made nothing of it, but bade him good night, and I, after a little
pause, to sleep again, being well pleased that it ended no worse, and being a little the better
pleased with it, because it was the Surveyor's clerk, which will make sport when I come to
tell Sir W. Batten of it, it being a report that old Edgeborough, the former Surveyor, who
died here, do now and then walk.

12th (Lord's day).  Up, and meeting Tom Willson he asked my pardon again, which I easily did
give him, telling him only that it was well I was not a woman with child, for it might have
made me miscarry.  With Sir J. Minnes to church, where an indifferent good sermon.  Here I
saw Mrs. Becky Allen, who hath been married, and is this day churched, after her bearing a
child.  She is grown tall, but looks very white and thin, and I can find no occasion while
I am here to come to have her company, which I desire and expected in my coming, but only coming
out of the church I kissed her and her sister and mother-in-law.  So to dinner, Sir J. Minnes,
Commissioner Pett, and I, &c., and after dinner walked in the garden, it being a very fine
day, the best we have had this great while, if not this whole summer.  To church again, and
after that walked through the Rope-ground to the Dock, and there over and over the Dock and
grounds about it, and storehouses, &c., with the officers of the Yard, and then to Commissioner
Pett's and had a good sullybub and other good things, and merry.  Commissioner Pett showed
me alone his bodys as a secrett, which I found afterwards by discourse with Sir J. Minnes that
he had shown them him, wherein he seems to suppose great mystery in the nature of Lynes to
be hid, but I do not understand it at all.  Thence walked to the Hill-house, being myself much
dissatisfied, and more than I thought I should have been with Commissioner Pett, being, by
what I saw since I came hither, convinced that he is not able to exercise the command in the
Yard over the officers that he ought to do, or somebody else, if ever the service be well looked
after there.  Sat up and with Sir J. Minnes talking, and he speaking his mind in slighting
of the Commissioner, for which I wish there was not so much reason.  For I do see he is but
a man of words, though indeed he is the ablest man that we have to do service if he would or
durst.  Sir J. Minnes being gone to bed, I took Mr. Whitfield, one of the clerks, and walked
to the Dock about eleven at night, and there got a boat and a crew, and rowed down to the guard-ships,
it being a most pleasant moonshine evening that ever I saw almost. The guard-ships were very
ready to hail us, being no doubt commanded thereto by their Captain, who remembers how I surprised
them the last time I was here.  However, I found him ashore, but the ship in pretty good order,
and the arms well fixed, charged, and primed.  Thence to the Soveraign, where I found no officers
aboard, no arms fixed, nor any powder to prime their few guns, which were charged, without
bullet though.  So to the London, where neither officers nor any body awake; I boarded her,
and might have done what I would, and at last could find but three little boys; and so spent
the whole night in visiting all the ships, in which I found, for the most part, neither an
officer aboard, nor any men so much as awake, which I was grieved to find, specially so soon
after a great Larum, as Commissioner Pett brought us word that he [had] provided against, and
put all in a posture of defence but a week ago, all which I am resolved to represent to the Duke.

13th.  So, it being high day, I put in to shore and to bed for two hours just, and so up again,
and with the Storekeeper and Clerk of the Rope-yard up and down the Dock and Rope-house, and
by and by mustered the Yard, and instructed the Clerks of the Cheque in my new way of Callbook,
and that and other things done, to the Hill-house, and there we eat something, and so by barge
to Rochester, and there took coach hired for our passage to London, and Mrs. Allen, the clerk
of the Rope-yard's wife with us, desiring her passage, and it being a most pleasant and warm
day, we got by four o'clock home.  In our way she telling us in what condition Becky Allen
is married against all expectation a fellow that proves to be a coxcomb and worth little if
any thing at all, and yet are entered into a way of living above their condition that will
ruin them presently, for which, for the lady's sake, I am much troubled.  Thence by water to
Whitehall, and so walked to St. James's, but missed Mr. Coventry.  Here late, with much ado
I left to look upon them, and went away, and by water, in a boat with other strange company,
there being no other to be had, and out of him into a sculler half to the bridge, and so home
and to Sir W. Batten, where I staid telling him and Sir J. Minnes and Mrs. Turner, with great
mirth, my being frighted at Chatham by young Edgeborough, and so home to supper and to bed,
before I sleep fancying myself to sport with Mrs. Stewart with great pleasure.

14th.  Up a little late, last night recovering my sleepiness for the night before, which was
lost, and so to my office to put papers and things to right, and making up my journal from
Wednesday last to this day.  All the morning at my office doing of business; at noon Mr. Hunt
came to me, and he and I to the Exchange, and a Coffee House, and drank there, and thence to
my house to dinner, whither my uncle Thomas came, and he tells me that he is going down to
Wisbech, there to try what he can recover of my uncle Day's estate, and seems to have good
arguments for what he do go about, in which I wish him good speed.  I made him almost foxed,
the poor man having but a bad head, and not used I believe nowadays to drink much wine.  So
after dinner, they being gone, I to my office, and so home to bed.  Up and all the morning
at the office, among other things with Cooper the Purveyor, whose dullness in his proceeding
in his work I was vexed at, and find that though he understands it may be as much as other
men that profess skill in timber, yet I perceive that many things, they do by rote, and very
dully.  Thence by water to Westminster, and there spent a good deal of time walking in the
Hall, which is going to be repaired, and, God forgive me, had a mind to have got Mrs. Lane
abroad, or fallen in with any woman else (in that hot humour).  But it so happened she could
not go out, nor I meet with any body else, and so I walked homeward, and in my way did many
and great businesses of my own at the Temple among my lawyers and others to my great content,
thanking God that I did not fall into any company to occasion spending time and money. To supper,
and then to a little viall and to bed, sporting in my fancy with the Queen.

16th.  Up and dispatched things into the country and to my father's, and two keggs of Sturgeon
and a dozen bottles of wine to Cambridge for my cozen Roger Pepys, which I give him.  By and
by down by water on several Deall ships, and stood upon a stage in one place seeing calkers
sheathing of a ship.  Then at Wapping to my carver's about my Viall head.  So home, and thence
to my Viall maker's in Bishops, gate Street; his name is Wise, who is a pretty fellow at it.
Thence to the Exchange, and so home to dinner, and then to my office, where a full board, and
busy all the afternoon, and among other things made a great contract with Sir W. Warren for
40,000 deals Swinsound, at L3 17s. od. per hundred.  In the morning before I went on the water
I was at Thames Street about some pitch, and there meeting Anthony Joyce, I took him and Mr.
Stacy, the Tarr merchant, to the tavern, where Stacy told me many old stories of my Lady Batten's
former poor condition, and how her former husband broke, and how she came to her state.  At
night, after office done, I went to Sir W. Batten's, where my Lady and I [had] some high words
about emptying our house of office, where I did tell her my mind, and at last agreed that it
should be done through my office, and so all well.  So home to bed.

17th.  Up, and after doing some business at my office, Creed came to me, and I took him to
my viall maker's, and there I heard the famous Mr. Stefkins play admirably well, and yet I
found it as it is always, I over expected.  I took him to the tavern and found him a temperate
sober man, at least he seems so to me.  I commit the direction of my viall to him. Thence to
the Change, and so home, Creed and I to dinner, and after dinner Sir W. Warren came to me,
and he and I in my closet about his last night's contract, and from thence to discourse of
measuring of timber, wherein I made him see that I could understand the matter well, and did
both learn of and teach him something.  Creed being gone through my staying talking to him
so long, I went alone by water down to Redriffe, and so to sit and talk with Sir W. Pen, where
I did speak very plainly concerning my thoughts of Sir G. Carteret and Sir J. Minnes.  So as
it may cost me some trouble if he should tell them again, but he said as much or more to me
concerning them both, which I may remember if ever it should come forth, and nothing but what
is true and my real opinion of them, that they neither do understand to this day Creed's accounts,
nor do deserve to be employed in their places without better care, but that the King had better
give them greater salaries to stand still and do nothing.  Thence coming home I was saluted
by Bagwell and his wife (the woman I have a kindness for), and they would have me into their
little house, which I was willing enough to, and did salute his wife.  They had got wine for
me, and I perceive live prettily, and I believe the woman a virtuous modest woman. Her husband
walked through to Redriffe with me, telling me things that I asked of in the yard, and so by
water home, it being likely to rain again to-night, which God forbid.  To supper and to bed.

18th.  Up and to my office, where all the morning, and Sir J. Minnes and I did a little, and
but a little business at the office.  So I eat a bit of victuals at home, and so abroad to
several places, as my bookseller's, and then to Thomson the instrument maker's to bespeak a
ruler for my pocket for timber, &c., which I believe he will do to my mind.  So to the Temple,
Wardrobe, and lastly to Westminster Hall, where I expected some bands made me by Mrs. Lane,
and while she went to the starchers for them, I staid at Mrs. Howlett's, who with her husband
were abroad, and only their daughter (which I call my wife) was in the shop, and I took occasion
to buy a pair of gloves to talk to her, and I find her a pretty spoken girl, and will prove
a mighty handsome wench.  I could love her very well.  By and by Mrs. Lane comes, and my bands
not being done she and I posted and met at the Crown in the Palace Yard, where we eat a chicken
I sent for, and drank, and were mighty merry, and I had my full liberty of towzing her and
doing what I would, but the last thing of all .  .  .  .  Of which I am heartily ashamed, but
I do resolve never to do more so.  But, Lord! to see what a mind she has to a husband, and
how she showed me her hands to tell her her fortune, and every thing that she asked ended always
whom and when she was to marry.  And I pleased her so well, saying as.  I know she would have
me, and then she would say that she had been with all the artists in town, and they always
told her the same things, as that she should live long, and rich, and have a good husband,
but few children, and a great fit of sickness, and 20 other things, which she says she has
always been told by others.  Here I staid late before my bands were done, and then they came,
and so I by water to the Temple, and thence walked home, all in a sweat with my tumbling of
her and walking, and so a little supper and to bed, fearful of having taken cold.

19th (Lord's day).  Lay very long in pleasant dreams till Church time, and so up, and it being
foul weather so that I cannot walk as I intended to meet my Cozen Roger at Thomas Pepys's house
(whither he rode last night), to Hatcham, I went to church, where a sober Doctor made a good
sermon.  So home to dinner alone, and then to read a little, and so to church again, where
the Scot made an ordinary sermon, and so home to my office, and there read over my vows and
increased them by a vow against all strong drink till November next of any sort or quantity,
by which I shall try how I can forbear it.  God send it may not prejudice my health, and then
I care not.  Then I fell to read over a silly play writ by a person of honour (which is, I
find, as much as to say a coxcomb), called "Love a la Mode,"' and that being ended, home, and
played on my lute and sung psalms till bedtime, then to prayers and to bed.

20th.  Up and to my office, and then walked to Woolwich, reading Bacon's "Faber fortunae,"

     [Pepys may here refer either to Essay XLI. (of Fortune) or to a
     chapter' in the "Advancement of Learning."  The sentence, "Faber
     quisque fortunae propria," said to be by Appius Claudian, is quoted
     more than once in the "De Augmentis Scientiarum," lib. viii., cap.
     2.]

which the oftener I read the more I admire.  There found Captain Cocke, and up and down to
many places to look after matters, and so walked back again with him to his house, and there
dined very finely.  With much ado obtained an excuse from drinking of wine, and did only taste
a drop of Sack which he had for his lady, who is, he fears, a little consumptive, and her beauty
begins to want its colour.  It was Malago Sack, which, he says, is certainly 30 years old,
and I tasted a drop of it, and it was excellent wine, like a spirit rather than wine.  Thence
by water to the office, and taking some papers by water to White Hall and St. James's, but
there being no meeting with the Duke to-day, I returned by water and down to Greenwich, to
look after some blocks that I saw a load carried off by a cart from Woolwich, the King's Yard.
But I could not find them, and so returned, and being heartily weary I made haste to bed, and
being in bed made Will read and construe three or four Latin verses in the Bible, and chide
him for forgetting his grammar.  So to sleep, and sleep ill all the night, being so weary,
and feverish with it.

21st.  And so lay long in the morning, till I heard people knock at my door, and I took it
to be about 8 o'clock (but afterwards found myself a little mistaken), and so I rose and ranted
at Will and the maid, and swore I could find my heart to kick them down stairs, which the maid
mumbled at mightily.  It was my brother, who staid and talked with me, his chief business being
about his going about to build his house new at the top, which will be a great charge for him,
and above his judgment. By and by comes Mr. Deane, of Woolwich, with his draught of a ship,
and the bend and main lines in the body of a ship very finely, and which do please me mightily,
and so am resolved to study hard, and learn of him to understand a body, and I find him a very
pretty fellow in it, and rational, but a little conceited, but that's no matter to me.  At
noon, by my Lady Batten's desire, I went over the water to Mr. Castle's, who brings his wife
home to his own house to-day, where I found a great many good old women, and my Lady, Sir W.
Batten, and Sir J. Minnes.  A good, handsome, plain dinner, and then walked in the garden;
which is pleasant enough, more than I expected there, and so Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten,
and I by water to the office, and there sat, and then I by water to the Temple about my law
business, and back again home and wrote letters to my father and wife about my desire that
they should observe the feast at Brampton, and have my Lady and the family, and so home to
supper and bed, my head aching all the day from my last night's bad rest, and yesterday's distempering
myself with over walking, and to-day knocking my head against a low door in Mr. Castle's house.
This day the Parliament kept a fast for the present unseasonable weather.

22nd.  Up, and by and by comes my uncle Thomas, to whom I paid L10 for his last half year's
annuity, and did get his and his son's hand and seal for the confirming to us Piggott's mortgage,
which was forgot to be expressed in our late agreement with him, though intended, and therefore
they might have cavilled at it, if they would.  Thence abroad calling at several places upon
some errands, among others to my brother Tom's barber and had my hair cut, while his boy played
on the viallin, a plain boy, but has a very good genius, and understands the book very well,
but to see what a shift he made for a string of red silk was very pleasant.  I found by his
words that my Lord Sandwich finds some pleasure in the country where he now is, whether he
means one of the daughters of the house or no I know not, but hope the contrary, that he thinks
he is very well pleased with staying there, but yet upon breaking up of the Parliament, which
the King by a message to-day says shall be on Monday next, he resolves to go. Ned Pickering,
the coxcomb, notwithstanding all his hopes of my Lord's assistance, wherein I am sorry to hear
my Lord has much concerned himself, is defeated of the place he expected under the Queen. 
He came hither by and by and brought some jewells for my Lady Jem. to put on, with which and
her other clothes she looks passing well.  I staid and dined with my Lord Crew, who whether
he was not so well pleased with me as he used to be, or that his head was full of business,
as I believe it was, he hardly spoke one word to me all dinner time, we dining alone, only
young Jack Crew, Sir Thomas's son, with us.  After dinner I bade him farewell.  Sir Thomas
I hear has gone this morning ill to bed, so I had no mind to see him.  Thence homewards, and
in the way first called at Wotton's, the shoemaker's, who tells me the reason of Harris's'
going from Sir Wm.  Thence to my bookseller's, and found my Waggoners done.  The very binding
cost me 14s., but they are well done, and so with a porter home with them, and so by water
to Ratcliffe, and there went to speak with Cumberford the platt-maker, and there saw his manner
of working, which is very fine and laborious.  So down to Deptford, reading Ben Jonson's "Devil
is an asse," and so to see Sir W. Pen, who I find walking out of doors a little, but could
not stand long; but in doors and I with him, and staid a great while talking, I taking a liberty
to tell him my thoughts in things of the office; that when he comes abroad again, he may know
what to think of me, and to value me as he ought. Walked home as I used to do, and being weary,
and after some discourse with Mr. Barrow, who came to see and take his leave of me, he being
to-morrow to set out toward the Isle of Man, I went to bed.  This day I hear that the Moores
have made some attaques upon the outworks of Tangier; but my Lord Tiviott; with the loss of
about 200 men, did beat them off, and killed many of them.  To-morrow the King and Queen for
certain go down to Tunbridge.  But the King comes hack again against Monday to raise the Parliament.

23rd.  Up and to my office, and thence by information from, Mr. Ackworth I went down to Woolwich,
and mustered the three East India ships that lie there, believing that there is great-juggling
between the Pursers and Clerks of the Cheque in cheating the King of the wages and victuals
of men that do not give attendance, and I found very few on board.  So to the yard, and there
mustered the yard, and found many faults, and discharged several fellows that were absent from
their business.  I staid also at Mr. Ackworth's desire at dinner with him and his wife, and
there was a simple fellow, a gentleman I believe of the Court, their kinsmen, that threatened
me I could have little discourse or begin, acquaintance with Ackworth's wife, and so after
dinner away, with all haste home, and there found Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten at the office,
and by Sir W. Batten's testimony and Sir G. Carteret's concurrence was forced to consent to
a business of Captain Cocke's timber, as bad as anything we have lately disputed about, and
all through Mr. Coventry's not being with us.  So up and to supper with Sir W. Batten upon
a soused mullett, very good meat, and so home and to bed.

24th.  Up pretty early (though of late I have been faulty by an hour or two every morning of
what I should do) and by water to the Temple, and there took leave of my cozen Roger Pepys,
who goes out of town to-day. So to Westminster Hall, and there at Mrs. Michell's shop sent
for beer and sugar and drink, and made great cheer with it among her and Mrs. Howlett, her
neighbour, and their daughters, especially Mrs. Howlett's daughter, Betty, which is a pretty
girl, and one I have long called wife, being, I formerly thought, like my own wife.  After
this good neighbourhood, which I do to give them occasion of speaking well and commending me
in some company that now and then I know comes to their shop, I went to the Six clerks' office,
and there had a writ for Tom Trice, and paid 20s. for it to Wilkinson, and so up and down to
many places, among others to the viall maker's, and there saw the head, which now pleases me
mightily, and so home, and being sent for presently to Mr. Bland's, where Mr. Povy and Gauden
and I were invited to dinner, which we had very finely and great plenty, but for drink, though
many and good, I drank nothing but small beer and water, which I drank so much that I wish
it may not do me hurt. They had a kinswoman, they call daughter, in the house, a short, ugly,
red-haired slut, that plays upon the virginalls, and sings, but after such a country manner
I was weary of it, but yet could not but commend it.  So by and by after dinner comes Monsr.
Gotier, who is beginning to teach her, but, Lord! what a droll fellow it is to make her hold
open her mouth, and telling this and that so drolly would make a man burst, but himself I perceive
sings very well.  Anon we sat dawn again to a collacon of cheesecakes, tarts, custards, and
such like, very handsome, and so up and away home, where I at the office a while, till disturbed
by, Mr. Hill, of Cambridge, with whom I walked in the garden a while, and thence home and then
in my dining room walked, talking of several matters of state till 11 at night, giving him
a glass of wine.  I was not unwilling to hear him talk, though he is full of words, yet a man
of large conversation, especially among the Presbyters and Independents; he tells me that certainly,
let the Bishops alone, and they will ruin themselves, and he is confident that the King's declaration
about two years since will be the foundation of the settlement of the Church some time or other,
for the King will find it hard to banish all those that will appear Nonconformists upon this
Act that is coming out against them.  He being gone, I to bed.

25th.  Up and to my office setting papers in order for these two or three days, in which I
have been hindered a little, and then having intended this day to go to Banstead Downs to see
a famous race, I sent Will to get himself ready to go with me, and I also by and by home and
put on my riding suit, and being ready came to the office to Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten,
and did a little of course at the office this morning, and so by boat to White Hall, where
I hear that the race is put off, because the Lords do sit in Parliament to-day.  However, having
appointed Mr. Creed to come to me to Fox Hall, I went over thither, and after some debate,
Creed and I resolved to go to Clapham, to Mr. Gauden's, who had sent his coach to their place
for me because I was to have my horse of him to go to the race.  So I went thither by coach
and my Will by horse with me; Mr. Creed he went over back again to Westminster to fetch his
horse. When I came to Mr. Gauden's one first thing was to show me his house, which is almost
built, wherein he and his family live.  Besides, with the good husbandry in making his bricks
and other things I do not think it costs him so much money as people think and discourse. 
By and by to dinner, and in comes Mr. Creed.  After dinner by Mr. Gauden's motion we got Mrs.
Gauden and her sister to sing to a viall, on which Mr. Gauden's eldest son (a pretty man, but
a simple one methinks) played but very poorly, and the musique bad, but yet I commended it.
Only I do find that the ladies have been taught to sing and do sing well now, but that the
viall puts them out.  I took the viall and played some things from one of their books, Lyra
lessons, which they seemed to like well.  Thus we pass an hour or two after dinner and towards
the evening we bade them Adieu! and took horse; being resolved that, instead of the race which
fails us, we would go to Epsum.  So we set out, and being gone a little way I sent home Will
to look to the house, and Creed and I rode forward; the road being full of citizens going and
coming toward Epsum, where, when we came, we could hear of no lodging, the town so full; but
which was better, I went towards Ashted, my old place of pleasure; and there by direction of
one goodman Arthur, whom we met on the way, we went to Farmer Page's, at which direction he
and I made good sport, and there we got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright
in, but rather than go further to look we staid there, and while supper was getting ready I
took him to walk up and down behind my cozen Pepys's house that was, which I find comes little
short of what I took it to be when I was a little boy, as things use commonly to appear greater
than then when one comes to be a man and knows more, and so up and down in the closes, which
I know so well methinks, and account it good fortune that I lie here that I may have opportunity
to renew my old walks.  It seems there is one Mr. Rouse, they call him the Queen's Tailor,
that lives there now.  So to our lodging to supper, and among other meats had a brave dish
of cream, the best I ever eat in my life, and with which we pleased ourselves much, and by
and by to bed, where, with much ado yet good sport, we made shift to lie, but with little ease,
and a little spaniel by us, which has followed us all the way, a pretty dogg, and we believe
that follows my horse, and do belong to Mrs. Gauden, which we, therefore, are very careful of.

26th (Lord's-day).  Up and to the Wells,

     [Epsom medicinal wells were discovered about 1618, but they did not
     become fashionable until the Restoration.  John Toland, in his
     "Description of Epsom," says that he often counted seventy coaches in
     the Ring (the present racecourse on the Downs) on a Sunday evening;
     but by the end of the eighteenth century Epsom had entirely lost its
     vogue.]

where great store of citizens, which was the greatest part of the company, though there were
some others of better quality.  I met many that I knew, and we drank each of us two pots and
so walked away, it being very pleasant to see how everybody turns up his tail, here one and
there another, in a bush, and the women in their quarters the like.  So I led him to Ashted
Church (by the place where Peter, my cozen's man, went blindfold and found a certain place
we chose for him upon a wager), where we had a dull Doctor, one Downe, worse than I think even
parson King was, of whom we made so much scorn, and after sermon home, and staid while our
dinner, a couple of large chickens, were dressed, and a good mess of cream, which anon we had
with good content, and after dinner (we taking no notice of other lodgers in the house, though
there was one that I knew, and knew and spoke to me, one Mr. Rider, a merchant), he and I to
walk, and I led him to the pretty little wood behind my cozens house, into which we got at
last by clambering, and our little dog with us, but when we were among the hazel trees and
bushes, Lord! what a course did we run for an hour together, losing ourselves, and indeed I
despaired I should ever come to any path, but still from thicket to thicket, a thing I could
hardly have believed a man could have been lost so long in so small a room.  At last I found
out a delicate walk in the middle that goes quite through the wood, and then went out of the
wood, and holloed Mr. Creed, and made him hunt me from place to place, and at last went in
and called him into my fine walk, the little dog still hunting with us through the wood.  In
this walk being all bewildered and weary and sweating, Creed he lay down upon the ground, which
I did a little, but I durst not long, but walked from him in the fine green walk, which is
half a mile long, there reading my vows as I used to on Sundays.  We rode out of the town through
Yowell beyond Nonesuch House a mile, and there our little dogg, as he used to do, fell a-running
after a flock of sheep feeding on the common, till he was out of sight, and then endeavoured
to come back again, and went to the last gate that he parted with us at, and there the poor
thing mistakes our scent, instead of coming forward he hunts us backward, and runs as hard
as he could drive back towards Nonesuch, Creed and I after him, and being by many told of his
going that way and the haste he made, we rode still and passed him through Yowell, and there
we lost any further information of him.  However, we went as far as Epsum almost, hearing nothing
of him, we went back to Yowell, and there was told that he did pass through the town. We rode
back to Nonesuch to see whether he might be gone back again, but hearing nothing we with great
trouble and discontent for the loss of our dogg came back once more to Yowell, and there set
up our horses and selves for all night, employing people to look for the dogg in the town,
but can hear nothing of him.  So walked back again, and by and by our supper being ready, a
good leg of mutton boiled, we supped and to bed, upon two beds in the same room, wherein we
slept most excellently all night.

27th.  Up in the morning about 7 o'clock, and after a little study, resolved of riding to the
Wells to look for our dogg, which we did, but could hear nothing; but it being much a warmer
day than yesterday there was great store of gallant company, more than then, to my greater
pleasure.  There was at a distance, under one of the trees on the common, a company got together
that sung.  I, at the distance, and so all the rest being a quarter of a mile off, took them
for the Waytes, so I rode up to them, and found them only voices, some citizens met by chance,
that sung four or five parts excellently.  I have not been more pleased with a snapp of musique,
considering the circumstances of the time and place, in all my life anything so pleasant. 
We drank each of us, three cupps, and so, after riding up to the horsemen upon the hill, where
they were making of matches to run, we went away and to Yowell, where we found our breakfast,
the remains of our supper last night hashed, and by and by, after the smith had set on two
new shoes to Creed's horse, we mounted, and with little discourse, I being intent upon getting
home in time, we rode hard home, observing Mr. Gauden's house, but not calling there (it being
too late for me to stay, and wanting their dog too).  The house stands very finely, and has
a graceful view to the highway.  Here meeting Creed, he and I down to the Hall, and I having
at Michell's shop wrote a little letter to Mr. Gauden, to go with his horse, and excusing my
not taking leave or so much as asking after the old lady the widow when we came away the other
day from them, he and I over the water to Fox Hall, and there sent away the horse with my letter,
and then to the new Spring Garden, walking up and down, but things being dear and little attendance
to be had we went away, leaving much brave company there, and so to a less house hard by, where
we liked very well their Codlin tarts, having not time, as we intended, to stay the getting
ready of a dish of pease.  And there came to us an idle boy to show us some tumbling tricks,
which he did very well, and the greatest bending of his body that ever I observed in my life.
So to White Hall and by water to the Bridge, and so home to bed, weary and well pleased with
my journey in all respects.  Only it cost me about 20s., but it was for my health, and I hope
will prove so, only I do find by my riding a little swelling to rise just by my anus.  I had
the same the last time I rode, and then it fell again, and now it is up again about the bigness
of the bag of a silkworm, makes me fearful of a rupture.  But I will speak to Mr. Hollyard
about it, and I am glad to find it now, that I may prevent it before it goes too far.

28th.  Up after sleeping very well, and so to my office setting down the Journall of this last
three days, and so settled to business again, I hope with greater cheerfulness and success
by this refreshment.  At the office all the morning, and at noon to Wise's about my viall that
is a-doing, and so home to dinner and then to the office, where we sat all the afternoon till
night, and I late at it till after the office was risen.  Late came my Jane and her brother
Will: to entreat for my taking of the boy again, but I will not hear her, though I would yet
be glad to do anything for her sake to the boy, but receive him again I will not, nor give
him anything. She would have me send him to sea; which if I could I would do, but there is
no ship going out.  The poor girl cried all the time she was with me, and would not go from
me, staying about two hours with me till 10 or 11 o'clock, expecting that she might obtain
something of me, but receive him I will not.  So the poor girl was fain to go away crying and
saying little.  So from thence home, where my house of office was emptying, and I find they
will do, it with much more cleanness than I expected.  I went up and down among them a good
while, but knowing that Mr. Coventry was to call me in the morning, I went to bed and left
them to look after the people.  So to bed.

29th.  Up about 6 o'clock, and found the people to have just done, and Hannah not gone to bed
yet, but was making clean of the yard and kitchen. Will newly gone to bed.  So I to my office,
and having given some order to Tom Hater, to whom I gave leave for his recreation to go down
to Portsmouth this Pay, I went down to Wapping to Sir W. Warren, and there staid an hour or
two discoursing of some of his goods and then things in general relating to this office, &c.,
and so home, and there going to Sir William Batten (having no stomach to dine at home, it being
yet hardly clean of last night's [mess])and there I dined with my Lady and her daughter and
son Castle, and mighty kind she is and I kind to her, but, Lord!  how freely and plainly she
rails against Commissioner Pett, calling him rogue, and wondering that the King keeps such
a fellow in the Navy. Thence by and by walked to see Sir W. Pen at Deptford, reading by the
way a most ridiculous play, a new one, called "The Politician Cheated."  After a little sitting
with him I walked to the yard a little and so home again, my Will with me, whom I bade to stay
in the yard for me, and so to bed. This morning my brother Tom was with me, and we had some
discourse again concerning his country mistress, but I believe the most that is fit for us
to condescend to, will not content her friends.

30th.  Up and to the office to get business ready for our sitting, this being the first day
of altering it from afternoon during the Parliament sitting to the fore-noon again.  By and
by Mr. Coventry only came (Sir John Minnes and Sir William Batten being gone this morning to
Portsmouth to pay some ships and the yard there), and after doing a little business he and
I down to Woolwich, and there up and down the yard, and by and by came Sir G. Carteret and
we all looked into matters, and then by water back to Deptford, where we dined with him at
his house, a very good dinner and mightily tempted with wines of all sorts and brave French
Syder, but I drunk none.  By this means Sir G. Carteret hath married two daughters this year
both very well. After dinner into Deptford yard, but our bellies being full we could do no
great business, and so parted, and Mr. Coventry and I to White Hall by water, where we also
parted, and I to several places about business, and so calling for my five books of the Variorum
print bound according to my common binding instead of the other which is more gaudy I went
home.  Up early to my accounts this month, and I find myself worth clear L730, the most I ever
had yet, which contents me though I encrease but very little. Thence home, in my way meeting
Mr. Rawlinson, who tells me that my uncle Wight is off of his Hampshire purchase and likes
less of the Wights, and would have me to be kind and study to please him, which I am resolved
to do.  Being at home he sent for me to dinner to meet Mr. Moore, so I went thither and dined
well, but it was strange for me to refuse, and yet I did without any reluctancy to drink wine
in a tavern, where nothing else almost was drunk, and that excellent good.  Thence with Mr.
Moore to the Wardrobe, and there sat while my Lord was private with Mr. Townsend about his
accounts an hour or two, we reading of a merry book against the Presbyters called Cabbala,
extraordinary witty.  Thence walked home and to my office, setting papers of all sorts and
writing letters and putting myself into a condition to go to Chatham with Mr. Coventry to-morrow.
So, at almost 12 o'clock, and my eyes tired with seeing to write, I went home and to bed. 
Ending the month with pretty good content of mind, my wife in the country and myself in good
esteem, and likely by pains to become considerable, I think, with God's blessing upon my diligence.

                          DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.
                                 AUGUST
                                  1663

Aug.  1st.  Up betimes and got me ready, and so to the office and put things in order for my
going.  By and by comes Sir G. Carteret, and he and I did some business, and then Mr. Coventry
sending for me, he staying in the boat, I got myself presently ready and down to him, he and
I by water to Gravesend (his man Lambert with us), and there eat a bit and so mounted, I upon
one of his horses which met him there, a brave proud horse, all the way talking of businesses
of the office and other matters to good purpose.  Being come to Chatham, we put on our boots
and so walked to the yard, where we met Commissioner Pett, and there walked up and down looking
and inquiring into many businesses, and in the evening went to the Commissioner's and there
in his upper Arbor sat and talked, and there pressed upon the Commissioner to take upon him
a power to correct and suspend officers that do not their duty and other things, which he unwillingly
answered he would if we would own him in it.  Being gone thence Mr. Coventry and I did discourse
about him, and conclude that he is not able to do the same in that yard that he might and can
and it maybe will do in another, what with his old faults and the relations that he has to
most people that act there.  After an hour or two's discourse at the Hill-house before going
to bed, I see him to his and he me to my chamber, he lying in the Treasurer's and I in the
Controller's chambers.

2nd (Lord's day).  Up and after the barber had done he and I walked to the Docke, and so on
board the Mathias, where Commissioner Pett and he and I and a good many of the officers and
others of the yard did hear an excellent sermon of Mr. Hudson's upon "All is yours and you
are God's," a most ready, learned, and good sermon, such as I have not heard a good while,
nor ever thought he could have preached.  We took him with us to the Hill-house, and there
we dined, and an officer or two with us.  So after dinner the company withdrew, and we three
to private discourse and laid the matters of the yard home again to the Commissioner, and discoursed
largely of several matters.  Then to the parish church, and there heard a poor sermon with
a great deal of false Greek in it, upon these words, "Ye are my friends, if ye do these things
which I command you."  Thence to the Docke and by water to view St. Mary Creeke, but do not
find it so proper for a wet docks as we would have it, it being uneven ground and hard in the
bottom and no, great depth of water in many places. Returned and walked from the Docke home,
Mr. Coventry and I very much troubled to see how backward Commissioner Pett is to tell any
of the faults of the officers, and to see nothing in better condition here for his being here
than they are in other yards where there is none.  After some discourse to bed.  But I sat
up an hour after Mr. Coventry was gone to read my vows, it raining a wonderful hard showre
about 11 at night for an hour together.  So to bed.

3rd.  Up both of us very betimes and to the Yard, and see the men called over and choose some
to be discharged.  Then to the Ropehouses and viewed them all and made an experiment which
was the stronger, English or Riga hemp, the latter proved the stronger, but the other is very
good, and much better we believe than any but Riga.  We did many other things this morning,
and I caused the Timber measurer to measure some timber, where I found much fault and with
reason, which we took public notice of, and did give them admonition for the time to come.
At noon Mr. Pett did give us a very great dinner, too big in all conscience, so that most of
it was left untouched.  Here was Collonell Newman and several other gentlemen of the country
and officers of the yard.  After dinner they withdrew and Commissioner Pett, Mr. Coventry and
I sat close to our business all the noon in his parler, and there run through much business
and answered several people.  And then in the evening walked in the garden, where we conjured
him to look after the yard, and for the time to come that he would take the whole faults and
ill management of the yard upon himself, he having full power and our concurrence to suspend
or do anything else that he thinks fit to keep people and officers to their duty.  He having
made good promises, though I fear his performance, we parted (though I spoke so freely that
he could have been angry) good friends, and in some hopes that matters will be better for the
time to come.  So walked to the Hillhouse (which we did view and the yard about it, and do
think to put it off as soon as we can conveniently) and there made ourselves ready and mounted
and rode to Gravesend (my riding Coate not being to be found I fear it is stole) on our way
being overtaken by Captain Browne that serves the office of the Ordnance at Chatham.  All the
way, though he was a rogue and served the late times all along, yet he kept us in discourse
of the many services that he did for many of the King's party, lords and Dukes, and among others
he recovered a dog that was stolne from Mr. Cary (head-keeper of the buck-hounds to the King)
and preserved several horses of the Duke of Richmond's, and his best horse he was forst to
put out his eyes and keep him for a stallion to preserve him from being carried away. But he
gone at last upon my enquiry to tell us how (he having been here too for survey of the Ropeyard)
the day's work of the Rope-makers become settled, which pleased me very well.  Being come to
our Inn Mr. Coventry and I sat, and talked till 9 or 10 a-clock and then to bed.

4th.  We were called up about four a-clock, and being ready went and took a Gravesend boat,
and to London by nine a-clock.  By the way talking of several businesses of the navy.  So to
the office, where Sir Wm. Pen (the first time that he has been with us a great while, he having
been long sick) met us, and there we sat all the morning.  My brother John I find come to town
to my house, as I sent for him, on Saturday last; so at noon home and dined with him, and after
dinner and the barber been with me I walked out with him to my viall maker's and other places
and then left him, and I by water to Blackbury's, and there talked with him about some masts
(and by the way he tells me that Paul's is now going to be repaired in good earnest), and so
with him to his garden close by his house, where I eat some peaches and apricots; a very pretty
place.  So over the water to Westminster hall, and not finding Mrs. Lane, with whom I purposed
to be merry, I went to Jervas's and took him and his wife over the water to their mother Palmer's
(the woman that speaks in the belly, and with whom I have two or three years ago made good
sport with Mr. Mallard), thinking because I had heard that she is a woman of that sort that
I might there have lit upon some lady of pleasure (for which God forgive me), but blest be
God there was none, nor anything that pleased me, but a poor little house that she has set
out as fine as she can, and for her singing which she pretends to is only some old body songs
and those sung abominably, only she pretends to be able to sing both bass and treble, which
she do something like, but not what I thought formerly and expected now; nor do her speaking
in her belly take me now as it did then, but it may be that is because I know it and see her
mouth when she speaks, which should not be.  After I had spent a shilling there in wine I took
boat with Jervas and his wife and set them at Westminster, and it being late forbore Mrs. Lane
and went by water to the Old Swan by a boat, where I had good sport with one of the young men
about his travells as far as Voxhall, in mockery, which yet the fellow answered me most prettily
and traveller-like unto my very good mirth.  So home, and with my brother eat a bit of bread
and cheese, and so to bed, he with me.  This day I received a letter from my wife, which troubles
me mightily, wherein she tells me how Ashwell did give her the lie to her teeth, and that thereupon
my wife giving her a box on the eare, the other struck her again, and a deal of stir which
troubles me, and that my Lady has been told by my father or mother something of my wife's carriage,
which altogether vexes me, and I fear I shall find a trouble of my wife when she comes home
to get down her head again, but if Ashwell goes I am resolved to have no more, but to live
poorly and low again for a good while, and save money and keep my wife within bounds if I can,
or else I shall bid Adieu to all content in the world.  So to bed, my mind somewhat disturbed
at this, but yet I shall take care, by prudence, to avoid the ill consequences which I fear,
things not being gone too far yet, and this height that my wife is come to being occasioned
from my own folly in giving her too much head heretofore for the year past.

5th.  All the morning at the office, whither Deane of Woolwich came to me and discoursed of
the body of ships, which I am now going about to understand, and then I took him to the coffee-house,
where he was very earnest against Mr. Grant's report in favour of Sir W. Petty's vessel, even
to some passion on both sides almost.  So to the Exchange, and thence home to dinner with my
brother, and in the afternoon to Westminster hall, and there found Mrs. Lane, and by and by
by agreement we met at the Parliament stairs (in my way down to the boat who should meet us
but my lady Jemimah, who saw me lead her but said nothing to me of her, though I ought to speak
to her to see whether she would take notice of it or no) and off to Stangate and so to the
King's Head at Lambeth marsh, and had variety of meats and drinks, but I did so towse her and
handled her, but could get nothing more from her though I was very near it; but as wanton and
bucksome as she is she dares not adventure upon the business, in which I very much commend
and like her. Staid pretty late, and so over with her by water, and being in a great sweat
with my towsing of her durst not go home by water, but took coach, and at home my brother and
I fell upon Des Cartes, and I perceive he has studied him well, and I cannot find but he has
minded his book, and do love it.  This evening came a letter about business from Mr. Coventry,
and with it a silver pen he promised me to carry inke in, which is very necessary.  So to prayers
and to bed.

6th.  Up and was angry with my maid Hannah for keeping the house no better, it being more dirty
now-a-days than ever it was while my whole family was together.  So to my office, whither Mr.
Coventry came and Sir William Pen, and we sat all the morning.  This day Mr. Coventry borrowed
of me my manuscript of the Navy.  At noon I to the 'Change, and meeting with Sir W. Warren,
to a coffee-house, and there finished a contract with him for the office, and so parted, and
I to my cozen Mary Joyce's at a gossiping, where much company and good cheer.  There was the
King's Falconer, that lives by Paul's, and his wife, an ugly pusse, but brought him money.
He speaking of the strength of hawkes, which will strike a fowle to the ground with that force
that shall make the fowle rebound a great way from ground, which no force of man or art can
do, but it was very pleasant to hear what reasons he and another, one Ballard, a rich man of
the same Company of Leathersellers of which the Joyces are, did give for this.  Ballard's wife,
a pretty and a very well-bred woman, I took occasion to kiss several times, and she to carve,
drink, and show me great respect.  After dinner to talk and laugh.  I drank no wine, but sent
for some water; the beer not being good.  A fiddler was sent for, and there one Mrs. Lurkin,
a neighbour, a good, and merry poor woman, but a very tall woman, did dance and show such tricks
that made us all merry, but above all a daughter of Mr. Brumfield's, black, but well-shaped
and modest, did dance very well, which pleased me mightily.  I begun the Duchess with her,
but could not do it; but, however, I came off well enough, and made mighty much of her, kissing
and leading her home, with her cozen Anthony and Kate Joyce (Kate being very handsome and well,
that is, handsomely dressed to-day, and I grew mighty kind and familiar with her, and kissed
her soundly, which she takes very well) to their house, and there I left them, having in our
way, though nine o'clock at night, carried them into a puppet play in Lincolnes Inn Fields,
where there was the story of Holofernes, and other clockwork, well done.  There was at this
house today Mr. Lawrence, who did give the name, it seems, to my cozen Joyce's child, Samuel,
who is a very civil gentleman, and his wife a pretty woman, who, with Kate Joyce, were stewards
of the feast to-day, and a double share cost for a man and a woman came to 16s., which I also
would pay, though they would not by any means have had me do so.  I walked home very well contented
with this afternoon's work, I thinking it convenient to keep in with the Joyces against a bad
day, if I should have occasion to make use of them.  So I walked home, and after a letter to
my wife by the post and my father, I home to supper, and after a little talk with my brother
to bed.

7th.  Up and to my office a little, and then to Brown's for my measuring rule, which is made,
and is certainly the best and the most commodious for carrying in one's pocket, and most useful
that ever was made, and myself have the honour of being as it were the inventor of this form
of it.  Here I staid discoursing an hour with him and then home, and thither came Sir Fairbrother
to me, and we walked a while together in the garden and then abroad into the cittie, and then
we parted for a while and I to my Viall, which I find done and once varnished, and it will
please me very well when it is quite varnished.  Thence home and to study my new rule till
my head aked cruelly.  So by and by to dinner and the Doctor and Mr. Creed came to me.  The
Doctor's discourse, which (though he be a very good-natured man) is but simple, was some sport
to me and Creed, though my head akeing I took no great pleasure in it.  We parted after dinner,
and I walked to Deptford and there found Sir W. Pen, and I fell to measuring of some planks
that was serving into the yard, which the people took notice of, and the measurer himself was
amused at, for I did it much more ready than he, and I believe Sir W. Pen would be glad I could
have done less or he more.  By and by he went away and I staid walking up and down, discoursing
with the officers of the yard of several things, and so walked back again, and on my way young
Bagwell and his wife waylayd me to desire my favour about getting him a better ship, which
I shall pretend to be willing to do for them, but my mind is to know his wife a little better.
They being parted I went with Cadbury the mast maker to view a parcel of good masts which I
think it were good to buy, and resolve to speak to the board about it.  So home, and my brother
John and I up and I to my musique, and then to discourse with him, and I find him not so thorough
a philosopher, at least in Aristotle, as I took him for, he not being able to tell me the definition
of final nor which of the 4 Qualitys belonged to each of the 4 Elements.  So to prayers, and
to bed, among other things being much satisfied with my new rule.

8th.  Up and to my office, whither I search for Brown the mathematical instrument maker, who
now brought me a ruler for measuring timber and other things so well done and in all things
to my mind that I do set up my trust upon it that I cannot have a better, nor any man else
have so good for this purpose, this being of my own ordering.  It being the greatest trouble
to me, he says, in the world to see not only in the Navy, but in the greatest matters of State,
where he can lay his finger upon the soare (meaning this man's faults, and this man's office
the fault lies in), and yet dare or can not remedy matters.  Thence to the Exchange about several
businesses, and so home to dinner, and in the afternoon took my brother John and Will down
to Woolwich by water, and after being there a good while, and eating of fruit in Sheldon's
garden, we began our walk back again, I asking many things in physiques of my brother John,
to which he gives me so bad or no answer at all, as in the regions of the ayre he told me that
he knew of no such thing, for he never read Aristotle's philosophy and Des Cartes ownes no
such thing, which vexed me to hear him say.  But I shall call him to task, and see what it
is that he has studied since his going to the University.  It was late before we could get
from Greenwich to London by water, the tide being against us and almost past, so that to save
time and to be clear of anchors I landed at Wapping, and so walked home weary enough, walking
over the stones.  This night Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes returned [from] Portsmouth, but
I did not go see them.

9th (Lord's day).  So home and at my office reading my vowes, and so to Sir W. Batten to dinner,
being invited and sent for, and being willing to hear how they left things at Portsmouth, which
I found but ill enough, and are mightily for a Commissioner to be at seat there to keep the
yard in order.  Thence in the afternoon with my Lady Batten, leading her through the streets
by the hand to St. Dunstan's Church, hard by us (where by Mrs. Russell's means we were set
well), and heard an excellent sermon of one Mr. Gifford, the parson there, upon "Remember Lot's
wife."  So from thence walked back to Mrs. Russell's, and there drank and sat talking a great
while.  Among other things talked of young Dawes that married the great fortune, who it seems
has a Baronet's patent given him, and is now Sir Thos. Dawes, and a very fine bred man they
say he is.  Thence home, and my brother being abroad I walked to my uncle Wight's and there
staid, though with little pleasure, and supped, there being the husband of Mrs. Anne Wight,
who it seems is lately married to one Mr. Bentley, a Norwich factor.  Home, and staid up a
good while examining Will in his Latin below, and my brother along with him in his Greeke,
and so to prayers and to bed.  This afternoon I was amused at the tune set to the Psalm by
the Clerke of the parish, and thought at first that he was out, but I find him to be a good
songster, and the parish could sing it very well, and was a good tune.  But I wonder that there
should be a tune in the Psalms that I never heard of.

10th.  Up, though not so early this summer as I did all the last, for which I am sorry, and
though late am resolved to get up betimes before the season of rising be quite past.  To my
office to fit myself to wait on the Duke this day.  After dinner I took leave and went to Greatorex's,
whom I found in his garden, and set him to work upon my ruler, to engrave an almanac and other
things upon the brasses of it, which a little before night he did, but the latter part he slubbered
over, that I must get him to do it over better, or else I shall not fancy my rule, which is
such a folly that I am come to now, that whereas before my delight was in multitude of books,
and spending money in that and buying alway of other things, now that I am become a better
husband, and have left off buying, now my delight is in the neatness of everything, and so
cannot be pleased with anything unless it be very neat, which is a strange folly.  Hither came
W. Howe about business, and he and I had a great deal of discourse about my Lord Sandwich,
and I find by him that my Lord do dote upon one of the daughters of Mrs. [Becke] where he lies,
so that he spends his time and money upon her.  He tells me she is a woman of a very bad fame
and very impudent, and has told my Lord so, yet for all that my Lord do spend all his evenings
with her, though he be at court in the day time, and that the world do take notice of it, and
that Pickering is only there as a blind, that the world may think that my Lord spends his time
with him when he do worse, and that hence it is that my Lord has no more mind to go into the
country than he has.  In fine, I perceive my Lord is dabbling with this wench, for which I
am sorry, though I do not wonder at it, being a man amorous enough, and now begins to allow
himself the liberty that he says every body else at Court takes. Here I am told that my Lord
Bristoll is either fled or concealed himself; having been sent for to the King, it is believed
to be sent to the Tower, but he is gone out of the way.  Hence home and examined a piece of,
Latin of Will's with my brother, and so to prayers and to bed.  This evening I had a letter
from my father that says that my wife will come to town this week, at which I wonder that she
should come to town without my knowing more of it.  But I find they have lived very ill together
since she went, and I must use all the brains I have to bring her to any good when she do come
home, which I fear will be hard to do, and do much disgust me the thoughts of it.

11th.  Up and to my office, whither, by and by, my brother Tom came, and I did soundly rattle
him for his neglecting to see and please the Joyces as he has of late done.  I confess I do
fear that he do not understand his business, nor will do any good in his trade, though he tells
me that he do please every body and that he gets money, but I shall not believe it till I see
a state of his accounts, which I have ordered him to bring me before he sees me any more. Upon
the 'Change my brother, and Will bring me word that Madam Turner would come and dine with me
to-day, so I hasted home and found her and Mrs. Morrice there (The. Joyce being gone into the
country), which is the reason of the mother rambling.  I got a dinner for them, and after dinner
my uncle Thomas and aunt Bell came and saw me, and I made them almost foxed with wine till
they were very kind (but I did not carry them up to my ladies).  So they went away, and so
my two ladies and I in Mrs. Turner's coach to Mr. Povy's, who being not within, we went in
and there shewed Mrs. Turner his perspective and volary,

     [A large birdcage, in which the birds can fly about; French
     'voliere'.  Ben Jonson uses the word volary.]

and the fine things that he is building of now, which is a most neat thing.  Thence to the
Temple and by water to Westminster; and there Morrice and I went to Sir R. Ling's to have fetched
a niece of his, but she was not within, and so we went to boat again and then down to the bridge,
and there tried to find a sister of Mrs. Morrice's, but she was not within neither, and so
we went through bridge, and I carried them on board the King's pleasure-boat, all the way reading
in a book of Receipts of making fine meats and sweetmeats, among others to make my own sweet
water, which made us good sport.  So I landed them at Greenwich, and there to a garden, and
gave them fruit and wine, and so to boat again, and finally, in the cool of the evening, to
Lyon Kee,

     [Lion Key, Lower Thames Street, where the famous Duchess of Suffolk
     in the time of Bishop Gardiner's persecution took boat for the
     continent.  James, Duke of York, also left the country from this
     same place on the night of April 20th, 1648, when he escaped from
     St. James's Palace.]

the tide against us, and so landed and walked to the Bridge, and there took a coach by chance
passing by, and so I saw them home, and there eat some cold venison with them, and drunk and
bade them good night, having been mighty merry with them, and I think it is not amiss to preserve,
though it cost me a little, such a friend as Mrs. Turner.  So home and to bed, my head running
upon what to do to-morrow to fit things against my wife's coming, as to buy a bedstead, because
my brother John is here, and I have now no more beds than are used.

12th.  A little to my office, to put down my yesterday's journall, and so abroad to buy a bedstead
and do other things.  So home again, and having put up the bedstead and done other things in
order to my wife's coming, I went out to several places and to Mrs. Turner's, she inviting
me last night, and there dined; with her and Madam Morrice and a stranger we were very merry
and had a fine dinner, and thence I took leave and to White Hall, where my Lords Sandwich,
Peterborough, and others made a Tangier Committee; spent the afternoon in reading and ordering
with a great deal of alteration, and yet methinks never a whit the better, of a letter drawn
by Creed to my Lord Rutherford.  The Lords being against anything that looked to be rough,
though it was in matter of money and accounts, wherein their courtship may cost the King dear.
Only I do see by them, that speaking in matters distasteful to him that we write to, it is
best to do it in the plainest way and without ambages or reasoning, but only say matters of
fact, and leave the party to collect your meaning.  Thence by water to my brother's, and there
I hear my wife is come and gone home, and my father is come to town also, at which I wondered.
But I discern it is to give my brother advice about his business, and it may be to pacify me
about the differences that have been between my wife and him and my mother at her late being
with them.  Though by and by he coming to Mr. Holden's (where I was buying a hat) he took no
notice to me of anything.  I talked to him a little while and left him to lie at the end of
the town, and I home, where methought I found my wife strange, not knowing, I believe, in what
temper she could expect me to be in, but I fell to kind words, and so we were very kind, only
she could not forbear telling me how she had been used by them and her mayde, Ashwell, in the
country, but I find it will be best not to examine it, for I doubt she's in fault too, and
therefore I seek to put it off from my hearing, and so to bed and there entertained her with
great content, and so to sleep.

13th.  Lay long in bed with my wife talking of family matters, and so up and to the office,
where we sat all the' morning, and then home to dinner, and after dinner my wife and I to talk
again about getting of a couple of good mayds and to part with Ashwell, which troubles me for
her father's sake, though I shall be glad to have the charge taken away of keeping a woman.
Thence a little to the office, and so abroad with my wife by water to White Hall, and there
at my Lord's lodgings met my Lady Jemimah, with whom we staid a good while.  Here in the Park
I met with Mr. Coventry, where he sent for a letter he had newly writ to me, wherein he had
enclosed one from Commissioner Pett complaining of his being defeated in his attempt to suspend
two pursers, wherein the manner of his doing it, and complaint of our seeing him (contrary
to our promises the other day), deserted, did make us laugh mightily, and was good sport to
think how awkwardly he goes about a thing that he has no courage of his own nor mind to do.
Mr. Coventry answered it very handsomely, but I perceive Pett has left off his corresponding
with me any more.  Thence to fetch my wife from Mrs. Hunt's, where now he was come in, and
we eat and drunk, and so away (their child being at home, a very lively, but not pretty at
all), by water to Mrs. Turner's, and there made a short visit, and so home by coach, and after
supper to prayers and to bed, and before going to bed Ashwell began to make her complaint,
and by her I do perceive that she has received most base usage from my wife, which my wife
sillily denies, but it is impossible the wench could invent words and matter so particularly,
against which my wife has nothing to say but flatly to deny, which I am sorry to see, and blows
to have past, and high words even at Hinchinbrooke House among my Lady's people, of which I
am mightily ashamed.  I said nothing to either of them, but let them talk till she was gone
and left us abed, and then I told my wife my mind with great sobriety of grief, and so to sleep.

14th.  Awake, and to chide my wife again, and I find that my wife has got too great head to
be brought down soon, nor is it possible with any convenience to keep Ashwell longer, my wife
is so set and convinced, as she was in Sarah, to make her appear a Lyer in every small thing
that we shall have no peace while she stays.  So I up and to my office doing several businesses
in my study, and so home to dinner.  The time having outslipt me and my stomach, it being past,
two a-clock, and yet before we could sit down to dinner Mrs. Harper and her cousin Jane came,
and we treated and discoursed long about her coming to my wife for a chamber mayd, and I think
she will do well.  So they went away expecting notice when she shall come, and so we sat down
to dinner at four a-clock almost, and then I walked forth to my brother's, where I found my
father very discontented, and has no mind to come to my house, and would have begun some of
the differences between my wife and him, but I desired to hear none of them, and am sorry at
my folly in forcing it and theirs in not telling me of it at the beginning, and therefore am
resolved to make the best of a bad market, and to bring my wife to herself again as soon and
as well as I can.  So we parted very kindly, and he will dine with me to-morrow or next day.
Thence walked home, doing several errands by the way, and at home took my wife to visit Sir
W. Pen, who is still lame, and after an hour with him went home and supped, and with great
content to bed.

15th.  Lay pretty long in bed, being a little troubled with some pain got by wind and cold,
and so up with good peace of mind, hoping that my wife will mind her house and servants, and
so to the office, and being too soon to sit walked to my viail, which is well nigh done, and
I believe I may have it home to my mind next week.  So back to my office, and there we sat
all the morning, I till 2 o'clock before I could go to dinner again. After dinner walked forth
to my instrument maker, and there had my rule he made me lay now so perfected, that I think
in all points I have never need or desire a better, or think that any man yet had one so good
in all the several points of it for my use.  So by water down to Deptford, taking into my boat
with me Mr. Palmer, one whom I knew and his wife when I was first married, being an acquaintance
of my wife's and her friends lodging at Charing Cross during our differences.  He joyed me
in my condition, and himself it seems is forced to follow the law in a common ordinary way,
but seems to do well, and is a sober man, enough by his discourse.  He landed with me at Deptford,
where he saw by the officers' respect to me a piece of my command, and took notice of it, though
God knows I hope I shall not be elated with that, but rather desire to be known for serving
the King well, and doing my duty.  He gone I walked up and down the yard a while discoursing
with the officers, and so by water home meditating on my new Rule with great pleasure.  And
home to dinner very pleasant, only some angry, notwithstanding my wife could not forbear to
give Ashwell, and after dinner to church again, and there, looking up and down, I found Pembleton
to stand in the isle against us, he coming too late to get a pew.  Which, Lord! into what a
sweat did it put me!  I do not think my wife did see him, which did a little satisfy me.  But
it makes me mad to see of what a jealous temper I am and cannot helpe it, though let him do
what he can I do not see, as I am going to reduce my family, what hurt he can do me, there
being no more occasion now for my wife to learn of him.  Here preached a confident young coxcomb.
So home, and I staid a while with Sir J. Minnes, at Mrs. Turner's, hearing his parrat talk,
laugh, and crow, which it do to admiration.  So home and with my wife to see Sir W. Pen, and
thence to my uncle Wight, and took him at supper and sat down, where methinks my uncle is more
kind than he used to be both to me now, and my father tell me to him also, which I am glad
at.  After supper home, it being extraordinary dark, and by chance a lanthorn came by, and
so we hired it to light us home, otherwise were we no sooner within doors but a great showre
fell that had doused us cruelly if we had not been within, it being as dark as pitch.  So to
prayers and to bed.

17th.  Up, and then fell into discourse, my wife and I to Ashwell, and much against my will
I am fain to express a willingness to Ashwell that she should go from us, and yet in my mind
I am glad of it, to ease me of the charge.  So she is to go to her father this day.  And leaving
my wife and her talking highly, I went away by coach with Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten to
St. James's, and there attended of course the Duke.  And so to White Hall, where I met Mr.
Moore, and he tells me with great sorrow of my lord's being debauched he fears by this woman
at Chelsey, which I am troubled at, and resolve to speak to him of it if I can seasonably.
Thence home, where I dined, and after dinner comes our old mayde Susan to look for a gorgett
that she says she has lost by leaving it here, and by many circumstances it being clear to
me that Hannah, our present cook-mayde, not only has it, but had it on upon her necke when
Susan came in, and shifted it off presently upon her coming in, I did charge her so home with
it (having a mind to have her gone from us), that in a huff she told us she would be gone to-night
if I would pay her her wages, which I was glad and my wife of, and so fetched her her wages,
and though I am doubtful that she may convey some things away with her clothes, my wife searching
them, yet we are glad of her being so gone, and so she went away in a quarter of an hour's
time.  Being much amused at this to have never a maid but Ashwell, that we do not intend to
keep, nor a boy, and my wife and I being left for an hour, till my brother came in, alone in
the house, I grew very melancholy, and so my brother being come in I went forth to Mrs. Holden's,
to whom I formerly spoke about a girle to come to me instead of a boy, and the like I did to
Mrs. Standing and also to my brother Tom, whom I found at an alehouse in Popinjay ally drinking,
and I standing with him at the gate of the ally, Ashwell came by, and so I left Tom and went
almost home with her, talking of her going away.  I find that she is willing to go, and told
her (though behind my back my wife has told her that it was more my desire than hers that she
should go, which was not well), that seeing my wife and she could not agree I did choose rather
(was she my sister) have her gone, it would be better for us and for her too.  To which she
willing agreed, and will not tell me anything but that she do believe that my wife would have
some body there that might not be so liable to give me information of things as she takes her
to be.  But, however, I must later to prevent all that.  I parted with her near home, agreeing
to take no notice of my coming along with her, and so by and by came home after her.  Where
I find a sad distracted house, which troubles me.  However, to supper and prayers and to bed.
And while we were getting to bed my wife began to discourse to her, and plainly asked whether
she had got a place or no.  And the other answered that she could go if we would to one of
our own office, to which we agreed if she would.  She thereupon said no; she would not go to
any but where she might teach children, because of keeping herself in use of what things she
had earnt, which she do not here nor will there, but only dressing.  By which I perceive the
wench is cunning, but one very fit for such a place, and accomplished to be woman to any lady
in the land.  So quietly to sleep, it being a cold night.  But till my house is settled, I
do not see that I can mind my business of the office, which grieves me to the heart.  But I
hope all will over in a little time, and I hope to the best.  This day at Mrs. Holden's I found
my new low crowned beaver according to the present fashion made, and will be sent home to-morrow.

18th.  Up and to my office, where we sat all the morning.  And at noon home, and my father
came and dined with me, Susan being come and helped my wife to dress dinner.  After dinner
my father and I talked about our country-matters, and in fine I find that he thinks L50 per
ann. will go near to keep them all, which I am glad of.  He having taken his leave of me and
my wife without any mention of the differences between them and my wife in the country, I went
forth to several places about businesses, and so home again, and after prayers to bed.

19th.  Up betimes, and my wife up and about the house, Susan beginning to have her drunken
tricks, and put us in mind of her old faults and folly and distractednesse, which we had forgot,
so that I became mightily troubled with her.  This morning came my joyners to new lay the floors,
and begun with the dining room.  I out and see my viall again, and it is very well, and to
Mr. Hollyard, and took some pills of him and a note under his hand to drink wine with my beere,
without which I was obliged, by my private vowe, to drink none a good while, and have strictly
observed it, and by my drinking of small beere and not eating, I am so mightily troubled with
wind, that I know not what to do almost.  Thence to White Hall, and there met Mr. Moore, and
fell a-talking about my Lord's folly at Chelsey, and it was our discourse by water to London
and to the great coffee house against the Exchange, where we sat a good while talking; and
I find that my lord is wholly given up to this wench, who it seems has been reputed a common
strumpett.  I have little encouragement from Mr. Moore to meddle with it to tell my Lord, for
fear it may do him no good, but me hurt.  Thence homewards, taking leave of him, and met Tom
Marsh, my old acquaintance at Westminster, who talks mightily of the honour of his place, being
Clerke Assistant to the Clerke of the House of Commons, and I take him to be a coxcombe, and
so did give him half a pint of wine, but drink none myself, and so got shut of him.  So home,
and there found my wife almost mad with Susan's tricks, so as she is forced to let her go and
leave the house all in dirt and the clothes all wet, and gets Goody Taylour to do the business
for her till another comes. Here came Will Howe, and he and I alone in my chamber talking of
my Lord, who drives me out of love to my Lord to tell my Lord of the matter we discoursed of,
which tend so much to the ruin of his state, and so I resolved to take a good heart and do
whatever comes of it.  He gone, we sat down and eat a bit of dinner fetched from the cooke's,
and so up again and to my joyners, who will make my floors very handsome.  By and by comes
in Pembleton, which begun to make me sweat, but I did give him so little countenance, and declared
at one word against dancing any more, and bid him a short (God be with you) myself, and so
he took as short a leave of my wife and so went away, and I think without any time of receiving
any great satisfaction from my wife or invitation to come again.  To my office till it was
dark doing business, and so home by candle light to make up my accounts for my Lord and Mr.
Moore.  By and by comes Mr. Moore to me, and staid a good while with me making up his accounts
and mine, and we did not come to any end therein for want of his papers, and so put it off
to another time.  He supped with me in all my dirt and disorder, and so went away and we to
bed.  I discoursed with him a great while about my speaking to my Lord of his business, and
I apprehend from him that it is likely to prove perhaps of bad effect to me and no good to
him, and therefore I shall even let it alone and let God do his will, at least till my Lord
is in the country, and then we shall see whether he resolves to come to Chelsey again or no,
and so order the stopping of him therein if we can.

20th.  Up betimes and to my office (having first been angry with my brother John, and in the
heat of my sudden passion called him Asse and coxcomb, for which I am sorry, it being but for
leaving the key of his chamber with a spring lock within side of his door), and there we sat
all the morning, and at noon dined at home, and there found a little girl, which she told my
wife her name was Jinny, by which name we shall call her.  I think a good likely girl, and
a parish child of St. Bride's, of honest parentage, and recommended by the churchwarden.  After
dinner among my joyners laying my floors, which please me well, and so to my office, and we
sat this afternoon upon an extraordinary business of victualling. In the evening came Commissioner
Pett, who fell foule on mee for my carriage to him at Chatham, wherein, after protestation
of my love and good meaning to him, he was quiet; but I doubt he will not be able to do the
service there that any other man of his ability would. Home in the evening my viall (and lute
new strung being brought home too), and I would have paid Mr. Hunt for it, but he did not come
along with it himself, which I expected and was angry for it, so much is it against my nature
to owe anything to any body.  This evening the girle that was brought to me to-day for so good
a one, being cleansed of lice this day by my wife, and good, new clothes put on her back, she
run away from Goody Taylour that was shewing her the way to the bakehouse, and we heard no
more of her.  So to supper and to bed.

21st.  Up betimes and among my joyners, and to my office, where the joyners are also laying
mouldings in the inside of my closet. Thence to my brother's, and there told him how my girl
has served us which he sent me, and directed him to get my clothes again, and get the girl
whipped.  So to other places by the way about small businesses, and so home, and after looking
over all my workmen, I went by water and land to Deptford, and there found by appointment Sir
W. Batten, but he was got to Mr. Waith's to dinner, where I dined with him, a good dinner and
good discourse, and his wife, I believe, a good woman.  We fell in discourse of Captain Cocke,
and how his lady has lost all her fine linen almost, but besides that they say she gives out
she had L3000 worth of linen, which we all laugh at, and Sir W. Batten (who I perceive is not
so fond of the Captain as he used to be, and less of her, from her slight receiving of him
and his lady it seems once) told me how he should say that he see he must spend L700 per ann.
get it how he could, which was a high speech, and by all men's discover, his estate not good
enough to spend so much.  After dinner altered our design to go to Woolwich, and put it off
to to-morrow morning, and so went all to Greenwich (Mrs. Waith excepted, who went thither,
but not to the same house with us, but to her father's, that lives there), to the musique-house,
where we had paltry musique, till the master organist came, whom by discourse I afterwards
knew, having employed him for my Lord Sandwich, to prick out something (his name Arundell),
and he did give me a fine voluntary or two, and so home by water, and at home I find my girl
that run away brought by a bedel of St. Bride's Parish, and stripped her and sent her away,
and a newe one come, of Griffin's helping to, which I think will prove a pretty girl.  Her
name, Susan, and so to supper after having this evening paid Mr. Hunt L3 for my viall (besides
the carving which I paid this day 10s. for to the carver), and he tells me that I may, without
flattery, say, I have as good a Theorbo viall and viallin as is in England.  So to bed.

22nd.  Up by four o'clock to go with Sir W. Batten to Woolwich and Sir J. Minnes, which we
did, though not before 6 or 7 by their laying a-bed. Our business was to survey the new wharf
building there, in order to the giving more to him that do it (Mr. Randall) than contracted
for, but I see no reason for it, though it be well done, yet no better than contracted to be.
Here we eat and drank at the Clerke of the Cheques, and in taking water at the Tower gate,
we drank a cup of strong water, which I did out of pure conscience to my health, and I think
is not excepted by my oaths, but it is a thing I shall not do again, hoping to have no such
occasion. After breakfast Mr. Castle and I walked to Greenwich, and in our way met some gypsys,
who would needs tell me my fortune, and I suffered one of them, who told me many things common
as others do, but bade me beware of a John and a Thomas, for they did seek to do me hurt, and
that somebody should be with me this day se'nnight to borrow money of me, but I should lend
him none.  She got ninepence of me. And so I left them and to Greenwich and so to Deptford,
where the two knights were come, and thence home by water, where I find my closet done at my
office to my mind and work gone well on at home; and Ashwell gone abroad to her father, my
wife having spoken plainly to her.  After dinner to my office, getting my closet made clean
and setting some papers in order, and so in the evening home and to bed.  This day Sir W. Batten
tells me that Mr. Newburne (of whom the nickname came up among us forarse Tom Newburne) is
dead of eating cowcumbers, of which, the other day, I heard another, I think Sir Nicholas Crisp's
son.

23rd (Lord's day).  Up and to church without my wife, she being all dirty, as my house is.
God forgive me, I looked about to see if I could spy Pembleton, but I could not, which did
please me not a little.  Home to dinner, and then to walk up and down in my house with my wife,
discoursing of our family matters, and I hope, after all my troubles of mind and jealousy,
we shall live happily still.  So to supper.  No pleasure or discourse with Ashwell, with whom
for her neglect and unconcernment to do any thing in this time of dirt and trouble in the house,
but gadding abroad as she has been all this afternoon, I know not whither.  After supper to
prayers and to bed, having been, by a sudden letter coming to me from Mr. Coventry, been with
Sir W. Pen, to discourse with him about sending 500 soldiers into Ireland.  I doubt matters
do not go very right there.

24th.  Up very early, and my joyners came to work.  My Lord would have had me dine with him,
but I had a mind to go home to my workmen, and so took a kind good bye of him, and so with
Creed to St. James's, and, missing Mr. Coventry, walked to the New Exchange, and there drank
some whey, and so I by water home, and found my closett at my office made very clean and neat
to my mind mightily, and home to dinner, and then to my office to brush my books, and put them
and my papers in order again, and all the afternoon till late at night doing business there,
and so home to supper, and then to work in my chamber, making matters of this day's accounts
clear in my books, they being a little extraordinary, and so being very late I put myself to
bed, the rest being long ago gone.

25th.  Up very early and removed the things out of my chamber into the dining room, it being
to be new floored this day.  So the workmen being come and falling to work there, I to the
office, and thence down to Lymehouse to Phin. Pett's about masts, and so back to the office,
where we sat; and being rose, and Mr. Coventry being gone, taking his leave, for that he is
to go to the Bath with the Duke to-morrow, I to the 'Change and there spoke with several persons,
and lastly with Sir W. Warren, and with him to a Coffee House, and there sat two hours talking
of office business and Mr. Wood's knavery, which I verily believe, and lastly he tells me that
he hears that Captain Cocke is like to become a principal officer, either a Controller or a
Surveyor, at which I am not sorry so either of the other may be gone, and I think it probable
enough that it may be so. So home at 2 o'clock, and there I found Ashwell gone, and her wages
come to 50s., and my wife, by a mistake from me, did give her 20s. more; but I am glad that
she is gone and the charge saved. After dinner among my joyners, and with them till dark night,
and this night they made an end of all; and so having paid them 40s. for their six days' work,
I am glad they have ended and are gone, for I am weary and my wife too of this dirt.  My wife
growing peevish at night, being weary, and I a little vexed to see that she do not retain things
in her memory that belong to the house as she ought and I myself do, I went out in a little
seeming discontent to the office, and after being there a while, home to supper and to bed.
To-morrow they say the King and the Duke set out for the Bath.

26th.  So home to dinner, and Mr. Moore came and dined with me, and after dinner I paid him
some money which evened all reckonings between him and me to this day, and for my Lord also
I paid him some money, so that now my Lord owes me, for which I have his bond, just L700. 
After long discourse with him of the fitness of his giving me a receipt for this money, which
I for my security think necessary and he otherwise do not think so, at last, after being a
little angry, and I resolving not to let go my money without it, he did give me one.  Thence
I took him, and he and I took a pleasant walk to Deptford and back again, I doing much business
there.  He went home and I home also, indoors to supper, being very glad to see my house begin
to look like itself again, hoping after this is over not to be in any dirt a great while again,
but it is very handsome, and will be more when the floors come to be of one colour.  So weary
to bed.

27th.  Up, after much pleasant talke with my wife and a little that vexes me, for I see that
she is confirmed in it that all that I do is by design, and that my very keeping of the house
in dirt, and the doing of this and any thing else in the house, is but to find her employment
to keep her within and from minding of her pleasure, in which, though I am sorry to see she
minds it, is true enough in a great degree.  To my office, and there we sat and despatched
much business.  Home and dined with my wife well, and then up and made clean my closet of books,
and had my chamber a third time made very clean, so that it is now in a very fine condition.
Thence down to see some good plank in the river with Sir W. Batten and back again, it being
a very cold day and a cold wind.  Home again, and after seeing Sir W. Pen, to my office, and
there till late doing of business, being mightily encouraged by every body that I meet withal
upon the 'Change and every where else, that I am taken notice of for a man that do the King's
business wholly and well.  For which the Lord be praised, for I know no honour I desire more.
Home to supper, where I find my house very clean from top to bottom again to my great content.
I found a feacho (as he calls it) of fine sugar and a case of orange-flower water come from
Mr. Cocke, of Lisbon, the fruits of my last year's service to him, which I did in great justice
to the man, a perfect stranger.  He sends it me desiring that I would not let Sir J. Minnes
know it, from whom he expected to have found the service done that he had from me, from whom
he could expect nothing, and the other failed him, and would have done I am sure to this day
had not I brought it to some end. After supper to bed.

28th.  At the office betimes (it being cold all night and this morning, and a very great frost
they say abroad, which is much, having had no summer at all almost), where we sat, and in the
afternoon also about settling the establishment of the number of men borne on ships, &c., till
the evening, and after that in my closet till late, and quite tired with business, home to
supper and to bed.

29th.  Abroad with my wife by water to Westminster, and there left her at my Lord's lodgings,
and I to Jervas the barber's, and there was trimmed, and did deliver back a periwigg, which
he brought by my desire the other day to show me, having some thoughts, though no great desire
or resolution yet to wear one, and so I put it off for a while.  Thence to my wife, and calling
at both the Exchanges, buying stockings for her and myself, and also at Leadenhall, where she
and I, it being candlelight, bought meat for to-morrow, having never a mayde to do it, and
I myself bought, while my wife was gone to another shop, a leg of beef, a good one, for six
pense, and my wife says is worth my money.  So walked home with a woman carrying our things.
I am mightily displeased at a letter Tom sent me last night, to borrow L20 more of me, and
yet gives me no account, as I have long desired, how matters stand with him in the world. I
am troubled also to see how, contrary to my expectation, my brother John neither is the scholler
nor minds his studies as I thought would have done, but loiters away his time, so that I must
send him soon to Cambridge again.

31st.  Up and to my office all the morning, where Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes did pay the
short allowance money to the East India companies, and by the assistance of the City Marshall
and his men, did lay hold of two or three of the chief of the companies that were in the mutiny
the other day, and sent them to prison.  This noon came Jane Gentleman to serve my wife as
her chamber mayde.  I wish she may prove well.  So ends this month, with my mind pretty well
in quiett, and in good disposition of health since my drinking at home of a little wine with
my beer; but no where else do I drink any wine at all.  The King and Queen and the Court at
the Bath, my Lord Sandwich in the country newly gone.
