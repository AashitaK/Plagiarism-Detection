For a year after Zoe's flight Jean Jacques wrapped Sebastian Dolores round his neck like a
collar, and it choked him like a boaconstrictor.  But not Sebastian Dolores alone did that.
When things begin to go wrong in the life of a man whose hands have held too many things, the
disorder flutters through all the radii of his affairs, and presently they rattle away from
the hub of his control.

So it was with Jean Jacques.  To take his reprobate father-in-law to his lonely home would
have brought him trouble in any case; but as things were, the Spaniard became only the last
straw which broke his camel's back.  And what a burden his camel carried--flour-mill, saw-mill,
ash- factory, farms, a general store, lime-kilns, agency for lightning-rods and insurance,
cattle-dealing, the project for the new cheese-factory, and money-lending!

Money-lending?  It seemed strange that Jean Jacques should be able to lend money, since he
himself had to borrow, and mortgage also, from time to time.  When things began to go really
wrong with him financially, he mortgaged his farms, his flour-mill, and saw-mill, and then
lent money on other mortgages.  This he did because he had always lent money, and it was a
habit so associated with his prestige, that he tied himself up in borrowing and lending and
counter-mortgaging till, as the saying is, "a Philadelphia lawyer" could not have unravelled
his affairs without having been born again in the law.  That he was able to manipulate his
tangled affairs, while keeping the confidence of those from whom he borrowed, and the admiration
of those to whom he lent, was evidence of his capacity. "Genius of a kind" was what his biggest
creditor called it later.

After a personal visit to St. Saviour's, this biggest creditor and financial potentate--M.
Mornay--said that if Jean Jacques had been started right and trained right, he would have been
a "general in the financial field, winning big battles."

M. Mornay chanced to be a friend of Judge Carcasson, and when he visited Vilray he remembered
that the Judge had spoken often of his humble but learned friend, the Clerk of the Court, and
of his sister.  So M. Mornay made his way from the office of the firm of avocats whom he had
instructed in his affairs with Jean Jacques, to that of M. Fille.  Here he was soon engaged
in comment on the master-miller and philosopher.

"He has had much trouble, and no doubt his affairs have suffered," remarked M. Fille cautiously,
when the ice had been broken and the Big Financier had referred casually to the difficulties
among which Jean Jacques was trying to maintain equilibrium; "but he is a man who can do things
too hard for other men."

The Big Financier lighted another cigar and blew away several clouds of smoke before he said
in reply, "Yes, I know he has had family trouble again, but that is a year ago, and he has
had a chance to get another grip of things."

"He did not sit down and mope," explained M. Fille.  "He was at work the next day after his
daughter's flight just the same as before.  He is a man of great courage.  Misfortune does
not paralyse him."

M. Mornay's speech was of a kind which came in spurts, with pauses of thought between, and
the pause now was longer than usual.

"Paralysis--certainly not," he said at last.  "Physical activity is one of the manifestations
of mental, moral, and even physical shock and injury.  I've seen a man with a bullet in him
run a half-mile--anywhere; I've seen a man ripped up by a crosscut-saw hold himself together,
and walk--anywhere--till he dropped.  Physical and nervous activity is one of the forms which
shattered force takes.  I expect that your 'M'sieu' Jean Jacques' has been busier this last
year than ever before in his life. He'd have to be; for a man who has as many irons in the
fire as he has, must keep running from bellows to bellows when misfortune starts to damp him down."

The Clerk of the Court sighed.  He realized the significance of what his visitor was saying.
Ever Since Zoe had gone, Jean Jacques had been for ever on the move, for ever making hay on
which the sun did not shine. Jean Jacques' face these days was lined and changeful.  It looked
unstable and tired--as though disturbing forces were working up to the surface out of control.
The brown eyes, too, were far more restless than they had ever been since the Antoine was wrecked,
and their owner returned with Carmen to the Manor Cartier.  But the new restlessness of the
eyes was different from the old.  That was a mobility impelled by an active, inquisitive soul,
trying to observe what was going on in the world, and to make sure that its possessor was being
seen by the world. This activity was that of a mind essentially concerned to find how many
ways it could see for escape from a maze of things; while his vanity was taking new forms.
It was always anxious to discover if the world was trying to know how he was taking the blows
of fate and fortune.  He had been determined that, whatever came, it should not see him paralysed
or broken.

As M. Fille only nodded his head in sorrowful assent, the Big Financier became more explicit.
He was determined to lose nothing by Jean Jacques, and he was prepared to take instant action
when it was required; but he was also interested in the man who might have done really powerful
things in the world, had he gone about them in the right way.

"M. Barbille has had some lawsuits this year, is it not so?" he asked.

"Two of importance, monsieur, and one is not yet decided," answered M. Fille.

"He lost those suits of importance?"

"That is so, monsieur."

"And they cost him six thousand dollars--and over?"  The Big Financier seemed to be pressing
towards a point.

"Something over that amount, monsieur."

"And he may lose the suit now before the Courts?"

"Who can tell, monsieur!" vaguely commented the little learned official.

M. Mornay was not to be evaded.  "Yes, yes, but the case as it stands-- to you who are wise
in experience of legal affairs, does it seem at all a sure thing for him?"

"I wish I could say it was, monsieur," sadly answered the other.

The Big Financier nodded vigorously.  "Exactly.  Nothing is so unproductive as the law.  It
is expensive whether you win or lose, and it is murderously expensive when you do lose.  You
will observe, I know, that your Jean Jacques is a man who can only be killed once--eh?"

"Monsieur?"  M. Fille really did not grasp this remark.

M. Mornay's voice became precise.  "I will explain.  He has never created; he has only developed
what has been created.  He inherited much of what he has or has had.  His designs were always
affected by the fact that he had never built from the very bottom.  When he goes to pieces--"

"Monsieur--to pieces!" exclaimed the Clerk of the Court painfully.

"Well, put it another way.  If he is broken financially, he will never come up again.  Not
because of his age--I lost a second fortune at fifty, and have a third ready to lose at sixty--but
because the primary initiative won't be in him.  He'll say he has lost, and that there's an
end to it all.  His philosophy will come into play--just at the last. It will help him in one
way and harm him in another."

"Ah, then you know about his philosophy, monsieur?" queried M. Fille. Was Jean Jacques' philosophy,
after all, to be a real concrete asset of his life sooner or later?

The Big Financier smiled, and turned some coins over in his pocket rather loudly.  Presently
he said: "The first time I ever saw him he treated me to a page of Descartes.  It cost him
one per cent.  I always charge a man for talking sentiment to me in business hours.  I had
to listen to him, and he had to pay me for listening.  I've no doubt his general yearly expenditure
has been increased for the same reason--eh, Maitre Fille?  He has done it with others--yes?"
M. Fille waved a hand in deprecation, and his voice had a little acidity as he replied: "Ah,
monsieur, what can we poor provincials do--any of us--in dealing with men like you, philosophy
or no philosophy?  You get us between the upper and the nether mill stones.  You are cosmopolitan;
M. Jean Jacques Barbille is a provincial; and you, because he has soul enough to forget business
for a moment and to speak of things that matter more than money and business, you grind him
into powder."

M. Mornay shook his head and lighted his cigar again.  "There you are wrong, Maitre Fille.
It is bad policy to grind to powder, or grind at all, men out of whom you are making money.
It is better to keep them from between the upper and nether mill-stones.

"I have done so with your Barbille.  I could give him such trouble as would bring things crashing
down upon him at once, if I wanted to be merely vicious in getting my own; but that would make
it impossible for me to meet at dinner my friend Judge Carcasson.  So, as long as I can, I
will not press him.  But I tell you that the margin of safety on which he is moving now is
too narrow--scarce a foot-hold.  He has too much under construction in the business of his
life, and if one stone slips out, down may come the whole pile.  He has stopped building the
cheese- factory--that represents sheer loss.  The ash-factory is to close next week, the saw-mill
is only paying its way, and the flour-mill and the farms, which have to sustain the call of
his many interests, can't stand the drain.  Also, he has several people heavily indebted to
him, and if they go down--well, it depends on the soundness of the security he holds. If they
listened to him talk philosophy, encouraged him to do it, and told him they liked it, when
the bargain was being made, the chances are the security is inadequate."

The Clerk of the Court bridled up.  "Monsieur, you are very hard on a man who for twenty-five
years has been a figure and a power in this part of the province.  You sneer at one who has
been a benefactor to the place where he lives; who has given with the right hand and the left;
whose enterprise has been a source of profit to many; and who has got a savage reward for the
acts of a blameless and generous life.  You know his troubles, monsieur, and we who have seen
him bear them with fortitude and Christian philosophy, we resent--"

"You need resent nothing, Maitre Fille," interrupted the Big Financier, not unkindly.  "What
I have said has been said to his friend and the friend of my own great friend, Judge Carcasson;
and I am only anxious that he should be warned by someone whose opinions count with him; whom
he can trust--"

"But, monsieur, alas!" broke in the Clerk of the Court, "that is the trouble; he does not select
those he can trust.  He is too confiding. He believes those who flatter him, who impose on
his good heart. It has always been so."

"I judge it is so still in the case of Monsieur Dolores, his daughter's grandfather?" the Big
Financier asked quizzically.

"It is so, monsieur," replied M. Fille.  "The loss of his daughter shook him even more than
the flight of his wife; and it is as though he could not live without that scoundrel near him--a
vicious man, who makes trouble wherever he goes.  He was a cause of loss to M. Barbille years
ago when he managed the ash-factory; he is very dangerous to women--even now he is a danger
to the future of a young widow" (he meant the widow of Palass Poucette); "and he has caused
a scandal by perjury as a witness, and by the consequences--but I need not speak of that here.
He will do Jean Jacques great harm in the end, of that I am sure.  The very day Mademoiselle
Zoe left the Manor Cartier to marry the English actor, Jean Jacques took that Spanish bad-lot
to his home; and there he stays, and the old friends go--the old friends go; and he does not
seem to miss them."

There was something like a sob in M. Fille's voice.  He had loved Zoe in a way that in a mother
would have meant martyrdom, if necessary, and in a father would have meant sacrifice when needed;
and indeed he had sacrificed both time and money to find Zoe.  He had even gone as far as Winnipeg
on the chance of finding her, making that first big journey in the world, which was as much
to him in all ways as a journey to Bagdad would mean to most people of M. Mornay's world. 
Also he had spent money since in corresponding with lawyers in the West whom he engaged to
search for her; but Zoe had never been found.  She had never written but one letter to Jean
Jacques since her flight.  This letter said, in effect, that she would come back when her husband
was no longer "a beggar" as her father had called him, and not till then.  It was written en
route to Winnipeg, at the dictation of Gerard Fynes, who had a romantic view of life and a
mistaken pride, but some courage too--the courage of love.

"He thinks his daughter will come back--yes?" asked M. Mornay.  "Once he said to me that he
was sorry there was no lady to welcome me at the Manor Cartier, but that he hoped his daughter
would yet have the honour.  His talk is quite spacious and lofty at times, as you know."

"So--that is so, monsieur .  .  .  Mademoiselle Zoe's room is always ready for her.  At time
of Noel he sent cards to all the families of the parish who had been his friends, as from his
daughter and himself; and when people came to visit at the Manor on New Year's Day, he said
to each and all that his daughter regretted she could not arrive in time from the West to receive
them; but that next year she would certainly have the pleasure."

"Like the light in the window for the unreturning sailor," somewhat cynically remarked the
Big Financier.  "Did many come to the Manor on that New Year's Day?"

"But yes, many, monsieur.  Some came from kindness, and some because they were curious--"

"And Monsieur Dolores?"

The lips of the Clerk of the Court curled, "He went about with a manner as soft as that of
a young cure.  Butter would not melt in his mouth. Some of the women were sorry for him, until
they knew he had given one of Jean Jacques' best bear-skin rugs to Madame Palass Poucette for
a New Year's gift."

The Big Financier laughed cheerfully.  "It's an old way to popularity-- being generous with
other people's money.  That is why I am here.  The people that spend your Jean Jacques' money
will be spending mine too, if I don't take care."

M. Fille noted the hard look which now settled in M. Mornay's face, and it disturbed him. 
He rose and leaned over the table towards his visitor anxiously.

"Tell me, if you please, monsieur, is there any real and immediate danger of the financial
collapse of Jean Jacques?"

The other regarded M. Fille with a look of consideration.  He liked this Clerk of the Court,
but he liked Jean Jacques for the matter of that, and away now from the big financial arena
where he usually worked, his natural instincts had play.  He had come to St. Saviour's with
a bigger thing in his mind than Jean Jacques and his affairs; he had come on the matter of
a railway, and had taken Jean Jacques on the way, as it were. The scheme for the railway looked
very promising to him, and he was in good humour; so that all he said about Jean Jacques was
free from that general irritation of spirit which has sacrificed many a small man on a big
man's altar.  He saw the agitation he had caused, and he almost repented of what he had already
said; yet he had acted with a view to getting M. Fille to warn Jean Jacques.

"I repeat what I said," he now replied.  "Monsieur Jean Jacques' affairs are too nicely balanced.
A little shove one way or another and over goes the whole caboose.  If anyone here has influence
over him, it would be a kindness to use it.  That case before the Court of Appeal, for instance;
he'd be better advised to settle it, if there is still time.  One or two of the mortgages he
holds ought to be foreclosed, so that he may get out of them all the law will let him.  He
ought to pouch the money that's owing him; he ought to shave away his insurance, his lightning-rod,
and his horsedealing business; and he ought to sell his farms and his store, and concentrate
on the flour-mill and the saw-mill.  He has had his warnings generally from my lawyers, but
what he wants most is the gentle hand to lead him; and I should think that yours, M. Fille,
is the hand the Almighty would choose if He was concerned with what happens at St. Saviour's
and wanted an agent."

The Clerk of the Court blushed greatly.  This was a very big man indeed in the great commercial
world, and flattery from him had unusual significance; but he threw out his hands with a gesture
of helplessness, and said: "Monsieur, if I could be of use I would; but he has ceased to listen
to me; he--"

He got no further, for there was a sharp knock at the street door of the outer office, and
M. Fille hastened to the other room.  After a moment he came back, a familiar voice following him.

"It is Monsieur Barbille, monsieur," M. Fille said quietly, but with apprehensive eyes.

"Well--he wants to see me?" asked M. Mornay.  "No, no, monsieur. It would be better if he did
not see you.  He is in some agitation."

"Fille!  Maitre Fille--be quick now," called Jean Jacques' voice from the other room.

"What did I say, monsieur?" asked the Big Financier.  "The mind that's received a blow must
be moving--moving; the man with the many irons must be flying from bellows to bellows!"

"Come, come, there's no time to lose," came Jean Jacques' voice again, and the handle of the
door of their room turned.

M. Fille's hand caught the handle.  "Excuse me, Monsieur Barbille, --a minute please," he persisted
almost querulously.  "Be good enough to keep your manners .  .  .  monsieur!" he added to the
Financier, "if you do not wish to speak with him, there is a door"--he pointed--"which will
let you into the side-street."

"What is his trouble?" asked M. Mornay.

M. Fille hesitated, then said reflectively: "He has lost his case in the Appeal Court, monsieur;
also, his cousin, Auguste Charron, who has been working the Latouche farm, has flitted, leaving--"

"Leaving Jean Jacques to pay unexpected debts?"

"So, monsieur."

"Then I can be of no use, I fear," remarked M. Mornay dryly.

"Fille!  Fille !" came the voice of Jean Jacques insistently from the room.

"And so I will say au revoir, Monsieur Fille," continued the Big Financier.

A moment later the great man was gone, and M. Fille was alone with the philosopher of the Manor
Cartier.

"Well, well, why do you keep me waiting!  Who was it in there--anyone that's concerned with
my affairs?" asked Jean Jacques.

In these days he was sensitive when there was no cause, and he was credulous where he ought
to be suspicious.  The fact that the little man had held the door against him made him sure
that M. Fille had not wished him to see the departed visitor.

"Come, out with it--who was it making fresh trouble for me?" persisted Jean Jacques.

"No one making trouble for you, my friend," answered the Clerk of the Court, "but someone who
was trying to do you a good turn."

"He must have been a stranger then," returned Jean Jacques bitterly. "Who was it?"

M. Fille, after an instant's further hesitation, told him.

"Oh, him--M. Momay !" exclaimed Jean Jacques, with a look of relief, his face lighting.  "That's
a big man with a most capable and far-reaching mind.  He takes a thing in as the ocean mouths
a river.  If I had had men like that to deal with all my life, what a different ledger I'd
be balancing now!  Descartes, Kant, Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, Hegel--he has an ear for them
all.  That is the intellectual side of him; and in business"--he threw up a hand--"there he
views the landscape from the mountain-top.  He has vision, strategy, executive.  He is Napoleon
and Anacreon in one.  He is of the builders on the one hand, of the Illuminati and the Encyclopedistes
on the other."

Even the Clerk of the Court, with his circumscribed range of thought and experience, in that
moment saw Jean Jacques as he really was.  Here was a man whose house of life was beginning
to sway from an earthquake; who had been smitten in several deadly ways, and was about to receive
buffetings beyond aught he had yet experienced, philosophizing on the tight-rope-- Blondin
and Plato in one.  Yet sardonically piteous as it was, the incident had shown Jean Jacques
with the germ of something big in him. He had recognized in M. Mornay, who could level him
to the dust tomorrow financially, a master of the world's affairs, a prospector of life's fields,
who would march fearlessly beyond the farthest frontiers into the unknown.  Jean Jacques' admiration
of the lion who could, and would, slay him was the best tribute to his own character.

M. Fille's eyes moistened as he realized it; and he knew that nothing he could say or do would
make this man accommodate his actions to the hard rules of the business of life; he must for
ever be applying to them conceptions of a half-developed mind.

"Quite so, quite so, Jean Jacques," M. Fille responded gently, "but" --here came a firmer note
to his voice, for he had taken to heart the lesson M. Mornay had taught him, and he was determined
to do his duty now when the opportunity was in his hand--"but you have got to deal with things
as they are; not as they might have been.  If you cannot have the great men you have to deal
with the little men like me.  You have to prove yourself bigger than the rest of us by doing
things better.  A man doesn't fail only because of others, but also because of himself.  You
were warned that the chances were all against you in the case that's just been decided, yet
you would go on; you were warned that your cousin, Auguste Charron, was in debt, and that his
wife was mad to get away from the farm and go West, yet you would take no notice.  Now he has
gone, and you have to pay, and your case has gone against you in the Appellate Court besides.
.  .  .  I will tell you the truth, my friend, even if it cuts me to the heart.  You have not
kept your judgment in hand; you have gone ahead like a bull at a gate; and you pay the price.
You listen to those who flatter, and on those who would go through fire and water for you,
you turn your back--on those who would help you in your hour of trouble, in your dark day."

Jean Jacques drew himself up with a gesture, impatient, masterful and forbidding.  "I have
fought my fight alone in the dark day; I have not asked for any one's help," he answered. 
"I have wept on no man's shoulder.  I have been mauled by the claws of injury and shame, and
I have not flinched.  I have healed my own wounds, and I wear my scars without--"

He stopped, for there came a sharp rat-tat-tat at the door which opened into the street.  Somehow
the commonplace, trivial interruption produced on both a strange, even startling effect.  It
suddenly produced in their minds a feeling of apprehension, as though there was whispered in
their ears, "Something is going to happen--beware!"

Rat-tat-tat!  The two men looked at each other.  The same thought was in the mind of both.
Jean Jacques clutched at his beard nervously, then with an effort he controlled himself.  He
took off his hat as though he was about to greet some important person, or to receive sentence
in a court.  Instinctively he felt the little book of philosophy which he always carried now
in his breast-pocket, as a pietist would finger his beads in moments of fear or anxiety.  The
Clerk of the Court passed his thin hand over his hair, as he was wont to do in court when the
Judge began his charge to the Jury, and then with an action more impulsive than was usual with
him, he held out his hand, and Jean Jacques grasped it. Something was bringing them together
just when it seemed that, in the storm of Jean Jacques' indignation, they were about to fall
apart. M. Fille's eyes said as plainly as words could do, "Courage, my friend!"

Rat-tat-tat!  Rat-tat-tat!  The knocking was sharp and imperative now. The Clerk of the Court
went quickly forward and threw open the door.

There stepped inside the widow of Palass Poucette.  She had a letter in her hand.  "M'sieu',
pardon, if I intrude," she said to M. Fille; "but I heard that M'sieu' Jean Jacques was here.
I have news for him."

"News!" repeated Jean Jacques, and he looked like a man who was waiting for what he feared
to hear.  "They told me at the post-office that you were here.  I got the letter only a quarter
of an hour ago, and I thought I would go at once to the Manor Cartier and tell M'sieu' Jean
Jacques what the letter says.  I wanted to go to the Manor Cartier for something else as well,
but I will speak of that by and by.  It is the letter now."

She pulled off first one glove and then the other, still holding the letter, as though she
was about to perform some ceremony.  "It was a good thing I found out that M'sieu' Jean Jacques
was here.  It saves a four- mile drive," she remarked.

"The news--ah, nom de Dieu, the slowness of the woman--like a river going uphill!" exclaimed
Jean Jacques, who was finding it hard to still the trembling of his limbs.

The widow of Palass Poucette flushed, but she had some sense in her head, and she realized
that Jean Jacques was a little unbalanced at the moment. Indeed, Jean Jacques was not so old
that she would have found it difficult to take a well-defined and warm interest in him, were
circumstances propitious.  She held out the letter to him at once. "It is from my sister in
the West--at Shilah," she explained.  "There is nothing in it you can't read, and most of it
concerns you."  Jean Jacques took the letter, but he could not bring himself to read it, for
Virginie Poucette's manner was not suggestive of happy tidings.  After an instant's hesitation
he handed the letter to M. Fille, who pressed his lips with an air of determination, and put
on his glasses.

Jean Jacques saw the face of the Clerk of the Court flush and then turn pale as he read the
letter.  "There, be quick!" he said before M. Fille had turned the first page.

Then the widow of Palass Poucette came to him and, in a simple harmless way she had, free from
coquetry or guile, stood beside him, took his hand and held it.  He seemed almost unconscious
of her act, but his fingers convulsively tightened on hers; while she reflected that here was
one who needed help sorely; here was a good, warm-hearted man on whom a woman could empty out
affection like rain and get a good harvest.  She really was as simple as a child, was Virginie
Poucette, and even in her acquaintance with Sebastian Dolores, there had only been working
in her the natural desire of a primitive woman to have a man saying that which would keep alive
in her the things that make her sing as she toils; and certainly Virginie toiled late and early
on her farm.  She really was concerned for Jean Jacques.  Both wife and daughter had taken
flight, and he was alone and in trouble.  At this moment she felt she would like to be a sister
to him--she was young enough to be his daughter almost.  Her heart was kind.

"Now!" said Jean Jacques at last, as the Clerk of the Court's eyes reached the end of the last
page.  "Now, speak!  It is--it is my Zoe?"

"It is our Zoe," answered M. Fille.

"Figure de Christ, what do you wait for--she is not dead?" exclaimed Jean Jacques with a courage
which made him set his feet squarely.

The Clerk of the Court shook his head and began.  "She is alive. Madame Poucette's sister saw
her by chance.  Zoe was on her way up the Saskatchewan River to the Peace River country with
her husband.  Her husband's health was bad.  He had to leave the stage in the United States
where he had gone after Winnipeg.  The doctors said he must live the open-air life.  He and
Zoe were going north, to take a farm somewhere."

"Somewhere!  Somewhere!" murmured Jean Jacques.  The farther away from Jean Jacques the better--that
is what she thinks."

"No, you are wrong, my friend," rejoined M. Fille.  "She said to Madame Poucette's sister"--he
held up the letter--"that when they had proved they could live without anybody's help they
would come back to see you. Zoe thought that, having taken her life in her own hands, she ought
to justify herself before she asked your forgiveness and a place at your table.  She felt that
you could only love her and be glad of her, if her man was independent of you.  It is a proud
and sensitive soul--but there it is!"

"It is romance, it is quixotism--ah, heart of God, what quixotism!" exclaimed Jean Jacques.

"She gets her romance and quixotism from Jean Jacques Barbille," retorted the Clerk of the
Court.  "She does more feeling than thinking--like you."

Jean Jacques' heart was bleeding, but he drew himself up proudly, and caught his hand away
from the warm palm of Poucette's widow.  As his affairs crumbled his pride grew more insistent.
M. Fille had challenged his intellect--his intellect!

"My life has been a procession of practical things," he declared oracularly.  "I have been
a man of business who designs.  I am no dreamer.  I think.  I act.  I suffer.  I have been
the victim of romance, not its interpreter.  Mercy of God, what has broken my life, what but
romance--romance, first with one and then with another!  More feeling than thinking, Maitre
Fille--you say that?  Why the Barbilles have ever in the past built up life on a basis of thought
and action, and I have added philosophy--the science of thought and act.  Jean Jacques Barbille
has been the man of design and the man of action also.  Don Quixote was a fool, a dreamer,
but Jean Jacques is no Don Quixote.  He is a man who has done things, but also he is a man
who has been broken on the wheel of life.  He is a man whose heart-strings have been torn--"

He had worked himself up into a fit of eloquence and revolt.  He was touched by the rod of
desperation, which makes the soul protest that it is right when it knows that it is wrong.

Suddenly, breaking off his speech, he threw up his hands and made for the door.

"I will fight it out alone!" he declared with rough emotion, and at the door he turned towards
them again.  He looked at them both as though he would dare them to contradict him.  The restless
fire of his eyes seemed to dart from one to the other.

"That's the way it is," said the widow of Palass Poucette coming quickly forward to him.  "It's
always the way.  We must fight our battles alone, but we don't have to bear the wounds alone.
In the battle you are alone, but the hand to heal the wounds may be another's.  You are a philosopher
--well, what I speak is true, isn't it?"

Virginie had said the one thing which could have stayed the tide of Jean Jacques' pessimism
and broken his cloud of gloom.  She appealed to him in the tune of an old song.  The years
and the curses of years had not dispelled the illusion that he was a philosopher.  He stopped
with his hand on the door.

"That's so, without doubt that's so," he said.  "You have stumbled on a truth of life, madame."

Suddenly there came into his look something of the yearning and hunger which the lonely and
forsaken feel when they are not on the full tide of doing.  It was as though he must have companionship,
in spite of his brave announcement that he must fight his fight alone.  He had been wounded
in the battle, and here was one who held out the hand of healing to him.  Never since his wife
had left him the long lonely years ago had a woman meant anything to him except as one of a
race; but in this moment here a woman had held his hand, and he could feel still the warm palm
which had comforted his own agitated fingers.

Virginie Poucette saw, and she understood what was passing in his mind. Yet she did not see
and understand all by any means; and it is hard to tell what further show of fire there might
have been, but that the Clerk of the Court was there, saying harshly under his breath, "The
huzzy! The crafty huzzy!"

The Clerk of the Court was wrong.  Virginie was merely sentimental, not intriguing or deceitful;
for Jean Jacques was not a widower--and she was an honest woman and genuinely tender-hearted.

"I'm coming to the Manor Cartier to-morrow," Virginie continued.  "I have a rug of yours. 
By mistake it was left at my house by M'sieu' Dolores."

"You needn't do that.  I will call at your place tomorrow for it," replied Jean Jacques almost
eagerly.  "I told M'sieu' Dolores to-day never to enter my house again.  I didn't know it was
your rug.  It was giving away your property, not his own," she hurriedly explained, and her
face flushed.

"That is the Spanish of it," said Jean Jacques bitterly.  His eyes were being opened in many
directions to-day.

M. Fille was in distress.  Jean Jacques had had a warning about Sebastian Dolores, but here
was another pit into which he might fall, the pit digged by a widow, who, no doubt, would not
hesitate to marry a divorced Catholic philosopher, if he could get a divorce by hook or by
crook. Jean Jacques had said that he was going to Virginie Poucette's place the next day. 
That was as bad as it could be; yet there was this to the good, that it was to-morrow and not
to-day; and who could tell what might happen between to-day and to-morrow!

A moment later the three were standing outside the office in the street. As Jean Jacques climbed
into his red wagon, Virginie Poucette's eyes were attracted to the northern sky where a reddish
glow appeared, and she gave an exclamation of surprise.

"That must be a fire," she said, pointing.

"A bit of pine-land probably," said M. Fille--with anxiety, however, for the red glow lay in
the direction of St. Saviour's where were the Manor Cartier and Jean Jacques' mills.  Maitre
Fille was possessed of a superstition that all the things which threaten a man's life to wreck
it, operate awhile in their many fields before they converge like an army in one field to deliver
the last attack on their victim.  It would not have seemed strange to him, if out of the night
a voice of the unseen had said that the glow in the sky came from the Manor Cartier.  This
very day three things had smitten Jean Jacques, and, if three, why not four or five, or fifty!

With a strange fascination Jean Jacques' eyes were fastened on the glow. He clucked to his
horses, and they started jerkily away.  M. Fille and the widow Poucette said good-bye to him,
but he did not hear, or if he heard, he did not heed.  His look was set upon the red reflection
which widened in the sky and seemed to grow nearer and nearer.  The horses quickened their
pace.  He touched them with the whip, and they went faster.  The glow increased as he left
Vilray behind.  He gave the horses the whip again sharply, and they broke into a gallop.  Yet
his eyes scarcely left the sky.  The crimson glow drew him, held him, till his brain was afire
also.  Jean Jacques had a premonition and a conviction which was even deeper than the imagination
of M. Fille.

In Vilray, behind him, the telegraph clerk was in the street shouting to someone to summon
the local fire-brigade to go to St. Saviour's.

"What is it--what is it?" asked M. Fille of the telegraph clerk in marked agitation.

"It's M'sieu' Jean Jacques' flour-mill," was the reply.

Wagons and buggies and carts began to take the road to the Manor Cartier; and Maitre Fille
went also with the widow of Palass Poucette.

CHAPTER XVII

HIS GREATEST ASSET

Jean Jacques did not go to the house of the widow of Palass Poucette "next day" as he had proposed:
and she did not expect him.  She had seen his flour-mill burned to the ground on the-evening
when they met in the office of the Clerk of the evening Court, when Jean Jacques had learned
that his Zoe had gone into farther and farther places away from him. Perhaps Virginie Poucette
never had shed as many tears in any whole year of her life as she did that night, not excepting
the year Palass Poucette died, and left her his farm and seven horses, more or less sound,
and a threshing-machine in good condition.  The woman had a rare heart and there was that about
Jean Jacques which made her want to help him.  She had no clear idea as to how that could be
done, but she had held his hand at any rate, and he had seemed the better for it.  Virginie
had only an objective view of things; and if she was not material, still she could best express
herself through the medium of the senses.

There were others besides her who shed tears also--those who saw Jean Jacques' chief asset
suddenly disappear in flame and smoke and all his other assets become thereby liabilities of
a kind; and there were many who would be the poorer in the end because of it.  If Jean Jacques
went down, he probably would not go alone.  Jean Jacques had done a good fire- insurance business
over a course of years, but somehow he had not insured himself as heavily as he ought to have
done; and in any case the fire- policy for the mill was not in his own hands.  It was in the
safe-keeping of M. Mornay at Montreal, who had warned M. Fille of the crisis in the money-master's
affairs on the very day that the crisis came.

No one ever knew how it was that the mill took fire, but there was one man who had more than
a shrewd suspicion, though there was no occasion for mentioning it.  This was Sebastian Dolores.
He had not set the mill afire.  That would have been profitable from no standpoint, and he
had no grudge against Jean Jacques.  Why should he have a grudge?  Jean Jacques' good fortune,
as things were, made his own good fortune; for he ate and drank and slept and was clothed at
his son-in-law's expense.  But he guessed accurately who had set the mill on fire, and that
it was done accidentally.  He remembered that a man who smoked bad tobacco which had to be
lighted over and over again, threw a burning match down after applying it to his pipe.  He
remembered that there was a heap of flour- bags near where the man stood when the match was
thrown down; and that some loose strings for tying were also in a pile beside the bags.  So
it was easy for the thing to have happened if the man did not turn round after he threw the
match down, but went swaying on out of the mill, and over to the Manor Cartier, and up staggering
to bed; for he had been drinking potato-brandy, and he had been brought up on the mild wines
of Spain!  In other words, the man who threw down the lighted match which did the mischief
was Sebastian Dolores himself.

He regretted it quite as much as he had ever regretted anything; and on the night of the fire
there were tears in his large brown eyes which deceived the New Cure and others; though they
did not deceive the widow of Palass Poucette, who had found him out, and who now had no pleasure
at all in his aged gallantries.  But the regret Dolores experienced would not prevent him from
doing Jean Jacques still greater injury if, and when, the chance occurred, should it be to
his own advantage.

Jean Jacques shed no tears on the night that his beloved flour-mill became a blackened ruin,
and his saw-mill had a narrow escape.  He was like one in a dream, scarcely realizing that
men were saying kind things to him; that the New Cure held his hand and spoke to him more like
a brother than one whose profession it was to be good to those who suffered.  In his eyes was
the same half-rapt, intense, distant look which came into them when, at Vilray, he saw that
red reflection in the sky over against St. Saviour's, and urged his horses onward.

The world knew that the burning of the mill was a blow to Jean Jacques, but it did not know
how great and heavy the blow was.  First one and then another of his friends said he was insured,
and that in another six months the mill-wheel would be turning again.  They said so to Jean
Jacques when he stood with his eyes fixed on the burning fabric, which nothing could save;
but he showed no desire to speak.  He only nodded and kept on staring at the fire with that
curious underglow in his eyes. Some chemistry of the soul had taken place in him in the hour
when he drove to the Manor Cartier from Vilray, and it produced a strange fire, which merged
into the reflection of the sky above the burning mill. Later, came things which were strange
and eventful in his life, but that under-glow was for ever afterwards in his eyes.  It was
in singular contrast to the snapping fire which had been theirs all the days of his life till
now--the snapping fire of action, will and design.  It still was there when they said to him
suddenly that the wind had changed, and that the flame and sparks were now blowing toward the
saw-mill.  Even when he gave orders, and set to work to defend the saw-mill, arranging a line
of men with buckets on its roof, and so saving it, this look remained.  It was something spiritual
and unmaterial, something, maybe, which had to do with the philosophy he had preached, thought
and practised over long years.  It did not disappear when at last, after midnight, everyone
had gone, and the smouldering ruins of his greatest asset lay mournful in the wan light of
the moon.

Kind and good friends like the Clerk of the Court and the New Cure had seen him to his bedroom
at midnight, leaving him there with a promise that they would come on the morrow; and he had
said goodnight evenly, and had shut the door upon them with a sort of smile.  But long after
they had gone, when Sebastian Dolores and Seraphe Corniche were asleep, he had got up again
and left the house, to gaze at the spot where the big white mill with the red roof had been-the
mill which had been there in the days of the Baron of Beaugard, and to which time had only
added size and adornment.  The gold-cock weathervane of the mill, so long the admiration of
people living and dead, and indeed the symbol of himself, as he had been told, being so full
of life and pride, courage and vigour-it lay among the ruins, a blackened relic of the Barbilles.

He had said in M. Fille's office not many hours before, "I will fight it all out alone," and
here in the tragic quiet of the night he made his resolve a reality.  In appearance he was
not now like the "Seigneur" who sang to the sailors on the Antoine when she was fighting for
the shore of Gaspe; nevertheless there was that in him which would keep him much the same man
to the end.

Indeed, as he got into bed that fateful night he said aloud: "They shall see that I am not
beaten.  If they give me time up there in Montreal I'll keep the place till Zoe comes back--till
Zoe comes home."

As he lay and tried to sleep, he kept saying over to himself, "Till Zoe comes home."

He thought that if he could but have Zoe back, it all would not matter so much.  She would
keep looking at him and saying, "There's the man that never flinched when things went wrong;
there's the man that was a friend to everyone."

At last a thought came to him--the key to the situation as it seemed, the one thing necessary
to meet the financial situation.  He would sell the biggest farm he owned, which had been to
him in its importance like the flour-mill itself.  He had had an offer for it that very day,
and a bigger offer still a week before.  It was mortgaged to within eight thousand dollars
of what it could be sold for but, if he could gain time, that eight thousand dollars would
build the mill again.  M. Mornay, the Big Financier, would certainly see that this was his
due--to get his chance to pull things straight.  Yes, he would certainly sell the Barbille
farm to-morrow.  With this thought in his mind he went to sleep at last, and he did not wake
till the sun was high.

It was a sun of the most wonderful brightness and warmth.  Yesterday it would have made the
Manor Cartier and all around it look like Arcady. But as it shone upon the ruins of the mill,
when Jean Jacques went out into the working world again, it made so gaunt and hideous a picture
that, in spite of himself, a cry of misery came from his lips.

Through all the misfortunes which had come to him the outward semblance of things had remained,
and when he went in and out of the plantation of the Manor Cartier, there was no physical change
in the surroundings, which betrayed the troubles and disasters fallen upon its overlord. There
it all was just as it had ever been, and seeming to deny that anything had changed in the lives
of those who made the place other than a dead or deserted world.  When Carmen went, when Zoe
fled, when his cousin Auguste Charron took his flight, when defeats at law abashed him, the
house and mills, and stores and offices, and goodly trees, and well- kept yards and barns and
cattle-sheds all looked the same.  Thus it was that he had been fortified.  In one sense his
miseries had seemed unreal, because all was the same in the outward scene.  It was as though
it all said to him: "It is a dream that those you love have vanished, that ill- fortune sits
by your fireside.  One night you will go to bed thinking that wife and child have gone, that
your treasury is nearly empty; and in the morning you will wake up and find your loved ones
sitting in their accustomed places, and your treasury will be full to overflowing as of old."

So it was while the picture of his home scene remained unbroken and serene; but the hideous
mass of last night's holocaust was now before his eyes, with little streams of smoke rising
from the cindered pile, and a hundred things with which his eyes had been familiar lay distorted,
excoriated and useless.  He realized with sudden completeness that a terrible change bad come
in his life, that a cyclone had ruined the face of his created world.

This picture did more to open up Jean Jacques' eyes to his real position in life than anything
he had experienced, than any sorrow he had suffered.  He had been in torment in the past, but
he had refused to see that he was in Hades.  Now it was as though he had been led through the
streets of Hell by some dark spirit, while in vain he looked round for his old friends Kant
and Hegel, Voltaire and Rousseau and Rochefoucauld, Plato and Aristotle.

While gazing at the dismal scene, however, and unheeding the idlers who poked about among the
ruins, and watched him as one who was the centre of a drama, he suddenly caught sight of the
gold Cock of Beaugard, which had stood on the top of the mill, in the very centre of the ruins.

Yes, there it was, the crested golden cock which had typified his own life, as he went head
high, body erect, spurs giving warning, and a clarion in his throat ready to blare forth at
any moment.  There was the golden Cock of Beaugard in the cinders, the ashes and the dust.
His chin dropped on his breast, and a cloud like a fog on the coast of Gaspe settled round
him.  Yet even as his head drooped, something else happened--one of those trivial things which
yet may be the pivot of great things.  A cock crowed--almost in his very ear, it seemed.  He
lifted his head quickly, and a superstitious look flashed into his face.  His eyes fastened
on the burnished head of the Cock among the ruins.  To his excited imagination it was as though
the ancient symbol of the Barbilles had spoken to him in its own language of good cheer and
defiance.  Yes, there it was, half covered by the ruins, but its head was erect in the midst
of fire and disaster.  Brought low, it was still alert above the wreckage.  The child, the
dreamer, the optimist, the egoist, and the man alive in Jean Jacques sprang into vigour again.
It was as though the Cock of Beaugard had really summoned him to action, and the crowing had
not been that of a barnyard bantam not a hundred feet away from him. Jean Jacques' head went
up too.

"Me--I am what I always was, nothing can change me," he exclaimed defiantly.  "I will sell
the Barbille farm and build the mill again."

So it was that by hook or by crook, and because the Big Financier had more heart than he even
acknowledged to his own wife, Jean Jacques did sell the Barbille farm, and got in cash--in
good hard cash-eight thousand dollars after the mortgage was paid.  M. Mornay was even willing
to take the inadequate indemnity of the insurance policy on the mill, and lose the rest, in
order that Jean Jacques should have the eight thousand dollars to rebuild.  This he did because
Jean Jacques showed such amazing courage after the burning of the mill, and spread himself
out in a greater activity than his career had yet shown.  He shaved through this financial
crisis, in spite of the blow he had received by the loss of his lawsuits, the flitting of his
cousin, Auguste Charron, and the farm debts of this same cousin.  It all meant a series of
manipulations made possible by the apparent confidence reposed in him by M. Mornay.

On the day he sold his farm he was by no means out of danger of absolute insolvency--he was
in fact ruined; but he was not yet the victim of those processes which would make him legally
insolvent.  The vultures were hovering, but they had not yet swooped, and there was the Manor
saw-mill going night and day; for by the strangest good luck Jean Jacques received an order
for M. Mornay's new railway (Judge Carcasson was behind that) which would keep his saw-mill
working twenty-four hours in the day for six months.

"I like his pluck, but still, ten to one, he loses," remarked M. Mornay to Judge Carcasson.
"He is an unlucky man, and I agree with Napoleon that you oughtn't to be partner with an unlucky
man."

"Yet you have had to do with Monsieur Jean Jacques," responded the aged Judge.

M. Mornay nodded indulgently.

"Yes, without risk, up to the burning of the mill.  Now I take my chances, simply because I'm
a fool too, in spite of all the wisdom I see in history and in life's experiences.  I ought
to have closed him up, but I've let him go on, you see."

"You will not regret it," remarked the Judge.  "He really is worth it."

"But I think I will regret it financially.  I think that this is the last flare of the ambition
and energy of your Jean Jacques.  That often happens--a man summons up all his reserves for
one last effort.  It's partly pride, partly the undefeated thing in him, partly the gambling
spirit which seizes men when nothing is left but one great spectacular success or else be blotted
out.  That's the case with your philosopher; and I'm not sure that I won't lose twenty thousand
dollars by him yet."

"You've lost more with less justification," retorted the Judge, who, in his ninetieth year,
was still as alive as his friend at sixty.

M. Mornay waved a hand in acknowledgment, and rolled his cigar from corner to corner of his
mouth.  "Oh, I've lost a lot more in my time, Judge, but with a squint in my eye!  But I'm
doing this with no astigmatism.  I've got the focus."

The aged Judge gave a conciliatory murmur-he had a fine persuasive voice. "You would never
be sorry for what you have done if you had known his daughter--his Zoe.  It's the thought of
her that keeps him going.  He wants the place to be just as she left it when she comes back."

"Well, well, let's hope it will.  I'm giving him a chance," replied M. Mornay with his wineglass
raised.  "He's got eight thousand dollars in cash to build his mill again; and I hope he'll
keep a tight hand on it till the mill is up."

Keep a tight hand on it?

That is what Jean Jacques meant to do; but if a man wants to keep a tight hand on money he
should not carry it about in his pocket in cold, hard cash.  It was a foolish whim of Jean
Jacques that he must have the eight thousand dollars in cash--in hundred-dollar bills--and
not in the form of a cheque; but there was something childlike in him.  When, as he thought,
he had saved himself from complete ruin, he wanted to keep and gloat over the trophy of victory,
and his trophy was the eight thousand dollars got from the Barbille farm.  He would have to
pay out two thousand dollars in cash to the contractors for the rebuilding of the mill at once,--they
were more than usually cautious--but he would have six thousand left, which he would put in
the bank after he had let people see that he was well fortified with cash.

The child in him liked the idea of pulling out of his pocket a few thousand dollars in hundred-dollar
bills.  He had always carried a good deal of money loose in his pocket, and now that his resources
were so limited he would still make a gallant show.  After a week or two he would deposit six
thousand dollars in the bank; but he was so eager to begin building the mill, that he paid
over the stipulated two thousand dollars to the contractors on the very day he received the
eight thousand.  A few days later the remaining six thousand were housed in a cupboard with
an iron door in the wall of his office at the Manor Cartier.

"There, that will keep me in heart and promise," said Jean Jacques as he turned the key in
the lock.

CHAPTER XVIII

JEAN JACQUES HAS AN OFFER

The day after Jean Jacques had got a new lease of life and become his own banker, he treated
himself to one of those interludes of pleasure from which he had emerged in the past like a
hermit from his cave.  He sat on the hill above his lime-kilns, reading the little hand-book
of philosophy which had played so big a part in his life.  Whatever else had disturbed his
mind and diverted him from his course, nothing had weaned him from this obsession.  He still
interlarded all his conversation with quotations from brilliant poseurs like Chateaubriand
and Rochefoucauld, and from missionaries of thought like Hume and Hegel.

His real joy, however, was in withdrawing for what might be called a seance of meditation from
the world's business.  Some men make celebration in wine, sport and adventure; but Jean Jacques
made it in flooding his mind with streams of human thought which often tried to run uphill,
which were frequently choked with weeds, but still were like the pool of Siloam to his vain
mind.  They bathed that vain mind in the illusion that it could see into the secret springs
of experience.

So, on as bright a day as ever the New World offered, Jean Jacques sat reciting to himself
a spectacular bit of logic from one of his idols, wedged between a piece of Aristotle quartz
and Plato marble.  The sound of it was good in his ears.  He mouthed it as greedily and happily
as though he was not sitting on the edge of a volcano instead of the moss- grown limestone
on a hill above his own manor.

"The course of events in the life of a man, whatever their gravity or levity, are only to be
valued and measured by the value and measure of his own soul.  Thus, what in its own intrinsic
origin and material should in all outer reason be a tragedy, does not of itself shake the foundations
or make a fissure in the superstructure.  Again--"

Thus his oracle, but Jean Jacques' voice suddenly died down, for, as he sat there, the face
of a woman made a vivid call of recognition.  He slowly awakened from his self-hypnotism, to
hear a woman speaking to him; to see two dark eyes looking at him from under heavy black brows
with bright, intent friendliness.

"They said at the Manor you had come this way, so I thought I'd not have my drive for nothing,
and here I am.  I wanted to say something to you, M'sieu' Jean Jacques."

It was the widow of Palass Poucette.  She looked very fresh and friendly indeed, and she was
the very acme of neatness.  If she was not handsome, she certainly had a true and sweet comeliness
of her own, due to the deep rose-colour of her cheeks, the ivory whiteness round the lustrous
brown eyes, the regular shining teeth which showed so much when she smiled, and the look half
laughing, half sentimental which dominated all.

Before she had finished speaking Jean Jacques was on his feet with his hat off.  Somehow she
seemed to be a part of that abstraction, that intoxication, in which he had just been drowning
his accumulated anxieties.  Not that Virginie Poucette was logical or philosophical, or a child
of thought, for she was wholly the opposite-practical, sensuous, emotional, a child of nature
and of Eve.  But neither was Jean Jacques a real child of thought, though he made unconscious
pretence of it.  He also was a child of nature--and Adam.  He thought he had the courage of
his convictions, but it was only the courage of his emotions.  His philosophy was but the bent
or inclination of a mind with a capacity to feel things rather than to think them.  He had
feeling, the first essential of the philosopher, but there he stayed, an undeveloped chrysalis.

His look was abstracted still as he took the hand of the widow of Palass Poucette; but he spoke
cheerfully.  "It is a pleasure, madame, to welcome you among my friends," he said.

He made a little flourish with the book which had so long been his bosom friend, and added:
"But I hope you are in no trouble that you come to me --so many come to me in their troubles,"
he continued with an air of satisfaction.

"Come to you--why, you have enough troubles of your own!" she made answer.  "It's because you
have your own troubles that I'm here."

"Why you are here," he remarked vaguely.

There was something very direct and childlike in Virginie Poucette.  She could not pretend;
she wore her heart on her sleeve.  She travelled a long distance in a little while.

"I've got no trouble myself," she responded.  "But, yes, I have," she added.  "I've got one
trouble--it's yours.  It's that you've been having hard times--the flour-mill, your cousin
Auguste Charron, the lawsuits, and all the rest.  They say at Vilray that you have all you
can do to keep out of the Bankruptcy Court, and that--"

Jean Jacques started, flushed, and seemed about to get angry; but she put things right at once.

"People talk more than they know, but there's always some fire where there's smoke," she hastened
to explain.  "Besides, your father-in-law babbles more than is good for him or for you.  I
thought at first that M. Dolores was a first-class kind of man, that he had had hard times
too, and I let him come and see me; but I found him out, and that was the end of it, you may
be sure.  If you like him, I don't want to say anything more, but I'm sure that he's no real
friend to you-or to anybody.  If that man went to confession--but there, that's not what I've
come for. I've come to say to you that I never felt so sorry for anyone in my life as I do
for you.  I cried all night after your beautiful mill was burned down.  You were coming to
see me next day--you remember what you said in M. Fille's office--but of course you couldn't.
Of course, there was no reason why you should come to see me really--I've 'only got two hundred
acres and the house.  It's a good house, though--Palass saw to that--and it's insured; but
still I know you'd have come just the same if I'd had only two acres.  I know.  There's hosts
of people you've been good to here, and they're sorry for you; and I'm sorrier than any, for
I'm alone, and you're alone, too, except for the old Dolores, and he's no good to either of
us--mark my words, no good to you!  I'm sorry for you, M'sieu' Jean Jacques, and I've come
to say that I'm ready to lend you two thousand dollars, if that's any help.  I could make it
more if I had time; but sometimes money on the spot is worth a lot more than what's just crawling
to you--snailing along while you eat your heart out.  Two thousand dollars is two thousand
dollars--I know what it's worth to me, though it mayn't be much to you; but I didn't earn it.
It belonged to a first-class man, and he worked for it, and he died and left it to me. It's
not come easy, go easy with me.  I like to feel I've got two thousand cash without having to
mortgage for it.  But it belonged to a number-one man, a man of brains--I've got no brains,
only some sense --and I want another good man to use it and make the world easier for himself."

It was a long speech, and she delivered it in little gasps of oratory which were brightened
by her wonderfully kind smile and the heart--not to say sentiment--which showed in her face.
The sentiment, however, did not prejudice Jean Jacques against her, for he was a sentimentalist
himself. His feelings were very quick, and before she had spoken fifty words the underglow
of his eyes was flooded by something which might have been mistaken for tears.  It was, however,
only the moisture of gratitude and the soul's good feeling.

"Well there, well there," he said when she had finished, "I've never had anything like this
in my life before.  It's the biggest thing in the art of being a neighbour I've ever seen.
You've only been in the parish three years, and yet you've shown me a confidence immense, inspiring!
It is as the Greek philosopher said, 'To conceive the human mind aright is the greatest gift
from the gods.'  And to you, who never read a line of philosophy, without doubt, you have done
the thing that is greatest. It says, 'I teach neighbourliness and life's exchange.'  Madame,
your house ought to be called Neighbourhood House.  It is the epitome of the spirit, it is
the shrine of--"

He was working himself up to a point where he could forget all the things that trouble humanity,
in the inebriation of an idealistic soul which had a casing of passion, but the passion of
the mind and not of the body; for Jean Jacques had not a sensual drift in his organism.  If
there had been a sensual drift, probably Carmen would still have been the lady of his manor,
and he would still have been a magnate and not a potential bankrupt; for in her way Carmen
had been a kind of balance to his judgment in the business of life, in spite of her own material
and (at the very last) sensual strain.  It was a godsend to Jean Jacques to have such an inspiration
as Virginie Poucette had given him.  He could not in these days, somehow, get the fires of
his soul lighted, as he was wont to do in the old times, and he loved talking--how he loved
talking of great things!  He was really going hard, galloping strong, when Virginie interrupted
him, first by an exclamation, then, as insistently he repeated the words, "It is the epitome
of the spirit, the shrine of--"

She put out a hand, interrupting him, and said: "Yes, yes, M'sieu' Jean Jacques, that's as
good as Moliere, I s'pose, or the Archbishop at Quebec, but are you going to take it, the two
thousand dollars?  I made a long speech, I know, but that was to tell you why I come with the
money" --she drew out a pocketbook--"with the order on my lawyer to hand the cash over to you.
As a woman I had to explain to you, there being lots of ideas about what a woman should do
and what she shouldn't do; but there's nothing at all for you to explain, and Mere Langlois
and a lot of others would think I'm vain enough now without your compliments.  I'm a neighbour
if you like, and I offer you a loan.  Will you take it--that's all?"

He held out his hand in silence and took the paper from her.  Putting his head a little on
one side, he read it.  At first he seemed hardly to get the formal language clear in his mind;
however, or maybe his mind was still away in that abstraction into which he had whisked it
when he began his reply to her fine offer; but he read it out aloud, first quickly, then very
slowly, and he looked at the signature with a deeply meditative air.

"Virginie Poucette--that's a good name," he remarked; "and also good for two thousand dollars!"
He paused to smile contentedly over his own joke. "And good for a great deal more than that
too," he added with a nod.

"Yes, ten times as much as that," she responded quickly, her eyes fixed on his face.  She scarcely
knew herself what she was thinking when she said it; but most people who read this history
will think she was hinting that her assets might be united with his, and so enable him to wipe
out his liabilities and do a good deal more besides.  Yet, how could that be, since Carmen
Dolores was still his wife if she was alive; and also they both were Catholics, and Catholics
did not recognize divorce!

Truth is, Virginie Poucette's mind did not define her feelings at all clearly, or express exactly
what she wanted.  Her actions said one thing certainly; but if the question had been put to
her, whether she was doing this thing because of a wish to take the place of Carmen Dolores
in Jean Jacques' life she would have said no at once.  She had not come to that --yet.  She
was simply moved by a sentiment of pity for Jean Jacques, and as she had no child, or husband,
or sister, or brother, or father, or mother, but only relatives who tried to impose upon her,
she needed an objective for the emotions of her nature, for the overflow of her unused affection
and her unsatisfied maternal spirit.  Here, then, was the most obvious opportunity--a man in
trouble who had not deserved the bitter bad luck which had come to him.  Even old Mere Langlois
in the market-place at Vilray had admitted that, and had said the same later on in Virginie's home.

For an instant Jean Jacques was fascinated by the sudden prospect which opened out before him.
If he asked her, this woman would probably loan him five thousand dollars--and she had mentioned
nothing about security!

"What security do you want?" he asked in a husky voice.

"Security?  I don't understand about that," she replied.  "I'd not offer you the money if I
didn't think you were an honest man, and an honest man would pay me back.  A dishonest man
wouldn't pay me back, security or no security."

"He'd have to pay you back if the security was right to start with," Jean Jacques insisted.
"But you don't want security, because you think I'm an honest man!  Well, for sure you're right.
I am honest.  I never took a cent that wasn't mine; but that's not everything.  If you lend
you ought to have security.  I've lost a good deal from not having enough security at the start.
You are willing to lend me money without security--that's enough to make me feel thirty again,
and I'm fifty--I'm fifty," he added, as though with an attempt to show her that she could not
think of him in any emotional way; though the day when his flour-mill was burned he had felt
the touch of her fingers comforting and thrilling.

"You think Jean Jacques Barbille's word as good as his bond?" he continued.  "So it is; but
I'm going to pull this thing through alone. That's what I said to you and Maitre Fille at his
office.  I meant it too --help of God, it is the truth!"

He had forgotten that if M. Mornay had not made it easy for him, and had not refrained from
insisting on his pound of flesh, he would now be insolvent and with no roof over him.  Like
many another man Jean Jacques was the occasional slave of formula, and also the victim of phases
of his own temperament.  In truth he had not realized how big a thing M. Mornay had done for
him.  He had accepted the chance given him as the tribute to his own courage and enterprise
and integrity, and as though it was to the advantage of his greatest creditor to give him another
start; though in reality it had made no difference to the Big Financier, who knew his man and,
with wide-open eyes, did what he had done.

Virginie was not subtle.  She did not understand, was never satisfied with allusions, and she
had no gift for catching the drift of things. She could endure no peradventure in her conversation.
She wanted plain speaking and to be literally sure.

"Are you going to take it?" she asked abruptly.

He could not bear to be checked in his course.  He waved a hand and smiled at her.  Then his
eyes seemed to travel away into the distance, the look of the dreamer in them; but behind all
was that strange, ruddy underglow of revelation which kept emerging from shadows, retreating
and emerging, yet always there now, in much or in little, since the burning of the mill.

"I've lent a good deal of money without security in my time," he reflected, "but the only people
who ever paid me back were a deaf and dumb man and a flyaway--a woman that was tired of selling
herself, and started straight and right with the money I lent her.  She had been the wife of
a man who studied with me at Laval.  She paid me back every penny, too, year by year for five
years.  The rest I lent money to never paid; but they paid, the dummy and the harlot that was,
they paid!  But they paid for the rest also!  If I had refused these two because of the others,
I'd not be fit to visit at Neighbourhood House where Virginie Poucette lives."

He looked closely at the order she had given him again, as though to let it sink in his mind
and be registered for ever.  "I'm going to do without any further use of your two thousand
dollars," he continued cheer fully. "It has done its work.  You've lent it to me, I've used
it"--he put the hand holding it on his breast--"and I'm paying it back to you, but without
interest."  He gave the order to her.

"I don't see what you mean," she said helplessly, and she looked at the paper, as though it
had undergone some change while it was in his hand.

"That you would lend it me is worth ten times two thousand to me, Virginie Poucette," he explained.
"It gives me, not a kick from behind --I've not had much else lately--but it holds a light
in front of me. It calls me.  It says, 'March on, Jean Jacques--climb the mountain.' It summons
me to dispose my forces for the campaign which will restore the Manor Cartier to what it has
ever been since the days of the Baron of Beaugard.  It quickens the blood at my heart.  It
restores--"

Virginie would not allow him to go on.  "You won't let me help you? Suppose I do lose the money--I
didn't earn it; it was earned by Palass Poucette, and he'd understand, if he knew.  I can live
without the money, if I have to, but you would pay it back, I know.  You oughtn't to take any
extra risks.  If your daughter should come back and not find you here, if she returned to the
Manor Cartier, and--"

He made an insistent gesture.  "Hush!  Be still, my friend--as good a friend as a man could
have.  If my Zoe came back I'd like to feel--I'd like to feel that I had saved things alone;
that no woman's money made me safe.  If Zoe or if--"

He was going to say, "If Carmen came back," for his mind was moving in past scenes; but he
stopped short and looked around helplessly.  Then presently, as though by an effort, he added
with a bravura note in his voice:

"The world has been full of trouble for a long time, but there have always been men to say
to trouble, 'I am master, I have the mind to get above it all.'  Well, I am one of them."

There was no note of vanity or bombast in his voice as he said this, and in his eyes that new
underglow deepened and shone.  Perhaps in this instant he saw more of his future than he would
speak of to anyone on earth.  Perhaps prevision was given him, and it was as the Big Financier
had said to Maitre Fille, that his philosophy was now, at the last, to be of use to him.  When
his wife had betrayed him, and his wife and child had left him, he had said, "Moi je suis philosophe!"
but he was a man of wealth in those days, and money soothes hurts of that kind in rare degree.
Would he still say, whatever was yet to come, that he was a philosopher?

"Well, I've done what I thought would help you, and I can't say more than that," Virginie remarked
with a sigh, and there was despondency in her eyes.  Her face became flushed, her bosom showed
agitation; she looked at him as she had done in Maitre Fille's office, and a wave of feeling
passed over him now, as it did then, and he remembered, in response to her look, the thrill
of his fingers in her palm.  His face now flushed also, and he had an impulse to ask her to
sit down beside him.  He put it away from him, however, for the present, at any rate-who could
tell what to-morrow might bring forth!--and then he held out his hand to her.  His voice shook
a little when he spoke; but it cleared, and began to ring, before he had said a dozen words.

"I'll never forget what you've said and done this morning, Virginie Poucette," he declared;
"and if I break the back of the trouble that's in my way, and come out cock o' the walk again"--the
gold Cock of Beaugard in the ruins near and the clarion of the bantam of his barnyard were
in his mind and ears--"it'll be partly because of you.  I hug that thought to me."

"I could do a good deal more than that," she ventured, with a tremulous voice, and then she
took her warm hand from his nervous grasp, and turned sharply into the path which led back
towards the Manor.  She did not turn around, and she walked quickly away.

There was confusion in her eyes and in her mind.  It would take some time to make the confusion
into order, and she was now hot, now cold, in all her frame, when at last she climbed into
her wagon.

This physical unrest imparted itself to all she did that day.  First her horses were driven
almost at a gallop; then they were held down to a slow walk; then they were stopped altogether,
and she sat in the shade of the trees on the road to her home, pondering--whispering to herself
and pondering.

As her horses were at a standstill she saw a wagon approaching. Instantly she touched her pair
with the whip, and moved on.  Before the approaching wagon came alongside, she knew from the
grey and the darkbrown horses who was driving them, and she made a strong effort for composure.
She succeeded indifferently, but her friend, Mere Langlois, did not notice this fact as her
wagon drew near.  There was excitement in Mere Langlois' face.

"There's been a shindy at the 'Red Eagle' tavern," she said.  "That father-in-law of M'sieu'
Jean Jacques and Rocque Valescure, the landlord, they got at each other's throats.  Dolores
hit Valescure on the head with a bottle."

"He didn't kill Valescure, did he?"

"Not that--no.  But Valescure is hurt bad--as bad.  It was six to one and half a dozen to the
other--both no good at all.  But of course they'll arrest the old man--your great friend! 
He'll not give you any more fur- robes, that's sure.  He got away from the tavern, though,
and he's hiding somewhere.  M'sieu' Jean Jacques can't protect him now; he isn't what he once
was in the parish.  He's done for, and old Dolores will have to go to trial.  They'll make
it hot for him when they catch him.  No more fur- robes from your Spanish friend, Virginie
!  You'll have to look somewhere else for your beaux, though to be sure there are enough that'd
be glad to get you with that farm of yours, and your thrifty ways, if you keep your character."

Virginie was quite quiet now.  The asperity and suggestiveness of the other's speech produced
a cooling effect upon her.

"Better hurry, Mere Langlois, or everybody won't hear your story before sundown.  If your throat
gets tired, there's Brown's Bronchial Troches--" She pointed to an advertisement on the fence
near by.  "M. Fille's cook says they cure a rasping throat."

With that shot, Virginie Poucette whipped up her horses and drove on. She did not hear what
Mere Langlois called after her, for Mere Langlois had been slow to recover from the unexpected
violence dealt by one whom she had always bullied.

"Poor Jean Jacques!" said Virginie Poucette to herself as her horses ate up the ground.  "That's
another bit of bad luck.  He'll not sleep to- night.  Ah, the poor Jean Jacques--and all alone--not
a hand to hold; no one to rumple that shaggy head of his or pat him on the back!  His wife
and Ma'm'selle Zoe, they didn't know a good thing when they had it.  No, he'll not sleep to-night-ah,
my dear Jean Jacques!"

CHAPTER XIX

SEBASTIAN DOLORES DOES NOT SLEEP

But Jean Jacques did sleep well that night; though it would have been better for him if he
had not done so.  The contractor's workmen had arrived in the early afternoon, he had seen
the first ton of debris removed from the ruins of the historic mill, and it was crowned by
the gold Cock of Beaugard, all grimy with the fire, but jaunty as of yore. The cheerfulness
of the workmen, who sang gaily an old chanson of mill- life as they tugged at the timbers and
stones, gave a fillip to the spirits of Jean Jacques, to whom had come a red-letter day.

Like Mirza on the high hill of Bagdad he had had his philosophic meditations; his good talk
with Virginie Poucette had followed; and the woman of her lingered in the feeling of his hand
all day, as something kind and homelike and true.  Also in the evening had come M. Fille, who
brought him a message from Judge Carcasson, that he must make the world sing for himself again.

Contrary to what Mere Langlois had thought, he had not been perturbed by the parish noise about
the savage incident at "The Red Eagle," and the desperate affair which would cause the arrest
of his father-in-law.  He was at last well inclined to be rid of Sebastian Dolores, who had
ceased to be a comfort to him, and who brought him hateful and not kindly memories of his lost
women, and the happy hours of the past they represented.

M. Fille had come to the Manor in much alarm, lest the news of the miserable episode at "The
Red Eagle" should bring Jean Jacques down again to the depths.  He was infinitely relieved,
however, to find that the lord of the Manor Cartier seemed only to be grateful that Sebastian
Dolores did not return, and nodded emphatically when M. Fille remarked that perhaps it would
be just as well if he never did return.

As M. Fille sat with his host at the table in the sunset light, Jean Jacques seemed quieter
and steadier of body and mind than he had been for a long, long time.  He even drank three
glasses of the cordial which Mere Langlois had left for him, with the idea that it might comfort
him when he got the bad news about Sebastian Dolores; and parting with M. Fille at the door,
he waved a hand and said: "Well, good-night, master of the laws.  Safe journey!  I'm off to
bed, and I'll sleep without rocking, that's very sure and sweet."

He stood and waved his hand several times to M. Fille--till he was out of sight indeed; and
the Clerk of the Court smiled to himself long afterwards, recalling Jean Jacques' cheerful
face as he had seen it at their parting in the gathering dusk.  As for Jean Jacques, when he
locked up the house at ten o'clock, with Dolores still absent, he had the air of a man from
whose shoulders great weights had fallen.

"Now I've shut the door on him, it'll stay shut," he said firmly.  "Let him go back to work.
He's no good here to me, to himself, or to anyone. And that business of the fur-robe and Virginie
Poucette--ah, that!"

He shook his head angrily, then seeing the bottle of cordial still uncorked on the sideboard,
he poured some out and drank it very slowly, till his eyes were on the ceiling above him and
every drop had gone home. Presently, with the bedroom lamp in his hand, he went upstairs, humming
to himself the chanson the workmen had sung that afternoon as they raised again the walls of
the mill:

                   "Distaff of flax flowing behind her
                    Margatton goes to the mill
                    On the old grey ass she goes,
                    The flour of love it will blind her
                    Ah, the grist the devil will grind her,
                    When Margatton goes to the mill!
                    On the old grey ass she goes,
                    And the old grey ass, he knows!"

He liked the sound of his own voice this night of his Reconstruction Period--or such it seemed
to him; and he thought that no one heard his singing save himself.  There, however, he was
mistaken.  Someone was hidden in the house--in the big kitchen-bunk which served as a bed or
a seat, as needed.  This someone had stolen in while Jean Jacques and M. Fille were at supper.
His name was Dolores, and he had a horse just over the hill near by, to serve him when his
work was done, and he could get away.

The constables of Vilray had twice visited the Manor to arrest him that day, but they had been
led in another direction by a clue which he had provided; and afterwards in the dusk he had
doubled back and hid himself under Jean Jacques' roof.  He had very important business at the
Manor Cartier.

Jean Jacques' voice ceased one song, and then, after a silence, it took up another, not so
melodious.  Sebastian Dolores had impatiently waited for this later "musicale" to begin--he
had heard it often before; and when it was at last a regular succession of nasal explosions,
he crawled out and began to do the business which had brought him to the Manor Cartier.

He did it all alone and with much skill; for when he was an anarchist in Spain, those long
years ago, he had learned how to use tools with expert understanding.  Of late, Spain had been
much in his mind.  He wanted to go back there.  Nostalgia had possessed him ever since he had
come again to the Manor Cartier after Zoe had left.  He thought much of Spain, and but little
of his daughter.  Memory of her was only poignant, in so far as it was associated with the
days preceding the wreck of the Antoine. He had had far more than enough of the respectable
working life of the New World; but there never was sufficient money to take him back to Europe,
even were it safe to go.  Of late, however, he felt sure that he might venture, if he could
only get cash for the journey.  He wanted to drift back to the idleness and adventure and the
"easy money" of the old anarchist days in Cadiz and Madrid.  He was sick for the patio and
the plaza, for the bull-fight, for the siesta in the sun, for the lazy glamour of the gardens
and the red wine of Valladolid, for the redolent cigarette of the roadside tavern.  This cold
iron land had spoiled him, and he would strive to get himself home again before it was too
late.  In Spain there would always be some woman whom he could cajole; some comrade whom he
could betray; some priest whom he could deceive, whose pocket he could empty by the recital
of his troubles.  But if, peradventure, he returned to Spain with money to spare in his pocket,
how easy indeed it would all be, and how happy he would find himself amid old surroundings
and old friends!

The way had suddenly opened up to him when Jean Jacques had brought home in hard cash, and
had locked away in the iron-doored cupboard in the officewall, his last, his cherished, eight
thousand dollars.  Six thousand of that eight were still left, and it was concern for this
six thousand which had brought Dolores to the Manor this night when Jean Jacques snored so
loudly.  The events of the day at "The Red Eagle" had brought things to a crisis in the affairs
of Carmen's father.  It was a foolish business that at the tavern--so, at any rate, he thought,
when it was all over, and he was awake to the fact that he must fly or go to jail.  From the
time he had, with a bottle of gin, laid Valescure low, Spain was the word which went ringing
through his head, and the way to Spain was by the Six Thousand Dollar Route, the New World
terminal of which was the cupboard in the wall at the Manor Cartier.

Little cared Sebastian Dolores that the theft of the money would mean the end of all things
for Jean Jacques Barbille-for his own daughter's husband.  He was thinking of himself, as he
had always done.

He worked for two whole hours before he succeeded in quietly forcing open the iron door in
the wall; but it was done at last.  Curiously enough, Jean Jacques' snoring stopped on the
instant that Sebastian Dolores' fingers clutched the money; but it began cheerfully again when
the door in the wall closed once more.

Five minutes after Dolores had thrust the six thousand dollars into his pocket, his horse was
galloping away over the hills towards the River St. Lawrence.  If he had luck, he would reach
it by the morning.  As it happened, he had the luck.  Behind him, in the Manor Cartier, the
man who had had no luck and much philosophy, snored on till morning in unconscious content.

It was a whole day before Jean Jacques discovered his loss.  When he had finished his lonely
supper the next evening, he went to the cupboard in his office to cheer himself with the sight
of the six thousand dollars. He felt that he must revive his spirits.  They had been drooping
all day, he knew not why.

When he saw the empty pigeon-hole in the cupboard, his sight swam.  It was some time before
it cleared, but, when it did, and he knew beyond peradventure the crushing, everlasting truth,
not a sound escaped him. His heart stood still.  His face filled with a panic confusion.  He
seemed like one bereft of understanding.

CHAPTER XX

"AU 'VOIR, M'SIEU' JEAN JACQUES"

It is seldom that Justice travels as swiftly as Crime, and it is also seldom that the luck
is more with the law than with the criminal.  It took the parish of St. Saviour's so long to
make up its mind who stole Jean Jacques' six thousand dollars, that when the hounds got the
scent at last the quarry had reached the water--in other words, Sebastian Dolores had achieved
the St. Lawrence.  The criminal had had near a day's start before a telegram was sent to the
police at Montreal, Quebec, and other places to look out for the picaroon who had left his
mark on the parish of St. Saviour's.  The telegram would not even then have been sent had it
not been for M. Fille, who, suspecting Sebastian Dolores, still refrained from instant action.
This he did because he thought Jean Jacques would not wish his beloved Zoe's grandfather sent
to prison.  But when other people at last declared that it must have been Dolores, M. Fille
insisted on telegrams being sent by the magistrate at Vilray without Jean Jacques' consent.
He had even urged the magistrate to "rush" the wire, because it came home to him with stunning
force that, if the money was not recovered, Jean Jacques would be a beggar.  It was better
to jail the father-in-law, than for the little money-master to take to the road a pauper, or
stay on at St. Saviour's as an underling where he had been overlord.

As for Jean Jacques, in his heart of hearts he knew who had robbed him. He realized that it
was one of the radii of the comedy-tragedy which began on the Antoine, so many years before;
and it had settled in his mind at last that Sebastian Dolores was but part of the dark machinery
of fate, and that what was now had to be.

For one whole day after the robbery he was like a man paralysed-- dispossessed of active being;
but when his creditors began to swarm, when M. Mornay sent his man of business down to foreclose
his mortgages before others could take action, Jean Jacques waked from his apathy.  He began
an imitation of his old restlessness, and made essay again to pull the strings of his affairs.
They were, however, so confused that a pull at one string tangled them all.

When the constables and others came to him, and said that they were on the trail of the robber,
and that the rogue would be caught, he nodded his head encouragingly; but he was sure in his
own mind that the flight of Dolores would be as successful as that of Carmen and Zoe.

This is the way he put it: "That man--we will just miss finding him, as I missed Zoe at the
railroad junction when she went away, as I missed catching Carmen at St. Chrisanthine.  When
you are at the shore, he will be on the river; when you are getting into the train, he will
be getting out.  It is the custom of the family.  At Bordeaux, the Spanish detectives were
on the shore gnashing their teeth, when he was a hundred yards away at sea on the Antoine.
They missed him like that; and we'll miss him too.  What is the good!  It was not his fault--that
was the way of his bringing up beyond there at Cadiz, where they think more of a toreador than
of John the Baptist.  It was my fault.  I ought to have banked the money.  I ought not to have
kept it to look at like a gamin with his marbles.  There it was in the wall; and there was
Dolores a long way from home and wanting to get back.  He found the way by a gift of the tools;
and I wish I had the same gift now; for I've got no other gift that'll earn anything for me."

These were the last dark or pessimistic words spoken at St. Saviour's by Jean Jacques; and
they were said to the Clerk of the Court, who could not deny the truth of them; but he wrung
the hand of Jean Jacques nevertheless, and would not leave him night or day.  M. Fille was
like a little cruiser protecting a fort when gunboats swarm near, not daring to attack till
their battleship heaves in sight.  The battleship was the Big Financier, who saw that a wreck
was now inevitable, and was only concerned that there should be a fair distribution of the
assets.  That meant, of course, that he should be served first, and then that those below the
salt should get a share.

Revelation after revelation had been Jean Jacques' lot of late years, but the final revelation
of his own impotence was overwhelming.  When he began to stir about among his affairs, he was
faced by the fact that the law stood in his way.  He realized with inward horror his shattered
egotism and natural vanity; he saw that he might just as well be in jail; that he had no freedom;
that he could do nothing at all in regard to anything he owned; that he was, in effect, a prisoner
of war where he had been the general commanding an army.

Yet the old pride intervened, and it was associated with some innate nobility; for from the
hour in which it was known that Sebastian Dolores had escaped in a steamer bound for France,
and could not be overhauled, and the chances were that he would never have to yield up the
six thousand dollars, Jean Jacques bustled about cheerfully, and as though he had still great
affairs of business to order and regulate.  It was a make-believe which few treated with scorn.
Even the workmen at the mill humoured him, as he came several times every day to inspect the
work of rebuilding; and they took his orders, though they did not carry them out. No one really
carried out any of his orders except Seraphe Corniche, who, weeping from morning till night,
protested that there never was so good a man as M'sieu' Jean Jacques; and she cooked his favourite
dishes, giving him no peace until he had eaten them.

The days, the weeks went on, with Jean Jacques growing thinner and thinner, but going about
with his head up like the gold Cock of Beaugard, and even crowing now and then, as he had done
of yore.  He faced the inevitable with something of his old smiling volubility; treating nothing
of his disaster as though it really existed; signing off this asset and that; disposing of
this thing and that; stripping himself bare of all the properties on his life's stage, in such
a manner as might have been his had he been receiving gifts and not yielding up all he owned.
He chatted as his belongings were, figuratively speaking, being carried away--as though they
were mechanical, formal things to be done as he had done them every day of a fairly long life;
as a clerk would check off the boxes or parcels carried past him by the porters.  M. Fille
could hardly bear to see him in this mood, and the New Cure hovered round him with a mournful
and harmlessly deceptive kindness.  But the end had to come, and practically all the parish
was present when it came.  That was on the day when the contents of the Manor were sold at
auction by order of the Court.  One thing Jean Jacques refused absolutely and irrevocably to
do from the first--refused it at last in anger and even with an oath: he would not go through
the Bankruptcy Court.  No persuasion had any effect. The very suggestion seemed to smirch his
honour.  His lawyer pleaded with him, said he would be able to save something out of the wreck,
and that his creditors would be willing that he should take advantage of the privileges of
that court; but he only said in reply:

"Thank you, thank you altogether, monsieur, but it is impossible--'non possumus, non possumus,
my son,' as the Pope said to Bonaparte.  I owe and I will pay what I can; and what I can't
pay now I will try to pay in the future, by the cent, by the dollar, till all is paid to the
last copper.  It is the way with the Barbilles.  They have paid their way and their debts in
honour, and it is in the bond with all the Barbilles of the past that I do as they do.  If
I can't do it, then that I have tried to do it will be endorsed on the foot of the bill."

No one could move him, not even Judge Carcasson, who from his armchair in Montreal wrote a
feeble-handed letter begging him to believe that it was "well within his rights as a gentleman"--this
he put in at the request of M. Mornay--to take advantage of the privileges of the Bankruptcy
Court. Even then Jean Jacques had only a few moments' hesitation.  What the Judge said made
a deep impression; but he had determined to drink the cup of his misfortune to the dregs. 
He was set upon complete renunciation; on going forth like a pilgrim from the place of his
troubles and sorrows, taking no gifts, no mercies save those which heaven accorded him.

When the day of the auction came everything went.  Even his best suit of clothes was sold to
a blacksmith, while his fur-coat was bought by a horse-doctor for fifteen dollars.  Things
that had been part of his life for a generation found their way into hands where he would least
have wished them to go--of those who had been envious of him, who had cheated or deceived him,
of people with whom he had had nothing in common.  The red wagon and the pair of little longtailed
stallions, which he had driven for six years, were bought by the owner of a rival flour-mill
in the parish of Vilray; but his best sleigh, with its coon-skin robes, was bought by the widow
of Palass Poucette, who bought also the famous bearskin which Dolores had given her at Jean
Jacques' expense, and had been returned by her to its proper owner.  The silver fruitdish,
once (it was said) the property of the Baron of Beaugard, which each generation of Barbilles
had displayed with as much ceremony as though it was a chalice given by the Pope, went to Virginie
Poucette.  Virginie also bought the furniture from Zoe's bedroom as it stood, together with
the little upright piano on which she used to play.  The Cure bought Jean Jacques' writing-desk,
and M. Fille purchased his armchair, in which had sat at least six Barbilles as owners of the
Manor.  The beaver-hat which Jean Jacques wore on state occasions, as his grandfather had done,
together with the bonnet rouge of the habitant, donned by him in his younger days --they fell
to the nod of Mere Langlois, who declared that, as she was a cousin, she would keep the things
in the family.  Mere Langlois would have bought the fruit-dish also if she could have afforded
to bid against Virginie Poucette; but the latter would have had the dish if it had cost her
two hundred dollars.  The only time she had broken bread in Jean Jacques' house, she had eaten
cake from this fruit-dish; and to her, as to the parish generally, the dish so beautifully
shaped, with its graceful depth and its fine-chased handles, was symbol of the social caste
of the Barbilles, as the gold Cock of Beaugard was sign of their civic and commercial glory.

Jean Jacques, who had moved about all day with an almost voluble affability, seeming not to
realize the tragedy going on, or, if he realized it, rising superior to it, was noticed to
stand still suddenly when the auctioneer put up the fruit-dish for sale.  Then the smile left
his face, and the reddish glow in his eyes, which had been there since the burning of the mill,
fled, and a touch of amazement and confusion took its place.  All in a moment he was like a
fluttered dweller of the wilds to whom comes some tremor of danger.

His mouth opened as though he would forbid the selling of the heirloom; but it closed again,
because he knew he had no right to withhold it from the hammer; and he took on a look like
that which comes to the eyes of a child when it faces humiliating denial.  Quickly as it came,
however, it vanished, for he remembered that he could buy the dish himself.  He could buy it
himself and keep it.  .  .  .  Yet what could he do with it?  Even so, he could keep it.  It
could still be his till better days came.

The auctioneer's voice told off the value of the fruitdish--"As an heirloom, as an antique;
as a piece of workmanship impossible of duplication in these days of no handicraft; as good
pure silver, bearing the head of Louis Quinze--beautiful, marvellous, historic, honourable,"
and Jean Jacques made ready to bid.  Then he remembered he had no money-- he who all his life
had been able to take a roll of bills from his pocket as another man took a packet of letters.
His glance fell in shame, and the words died on his lips, even as M. Manotel, the auctioneer,
was about to add another five-dollar bid to the price, which already was standing at forty dollars.

It was at this moment Jean Jacques heard a woman's voice bidding, then two women's voices.
Looking up he saw that one of the women was Mere Langlois and the other was Virginie Poucette,
who had made the first bid. For a moment they contended, and then Mere Langlois fell out of
the contest, and Virginie continued it with an ambitious farmer from the next county, who was
about to become a Member of Parliament.  Presently the owner of a river pleasure-steamer entered
into the costly emulation also, but he soon fell away; and Virginie Poucette stubbornly raised
the bidding by five dollars each time, till the silver symbol of the Barbilles' pride had reached
one hundred dollars.  Then she raised the price by ten dollars, and her rival, seeing that
he was face to face with a woman who would now bid till her last dollar was at stake, withdrew;
and Virginie was left triumphant with the heirloom.

At the moment when Virginie turned away with the handsome dish from M. Manotel, and the crowd
cheered her gaily, she caught Jean-Jacques' eye, and she came straight towards him.  She wanted
to give the dish to him then and there; but she knew that this would provide annoying gossip
for many a day, and besides, she thought he would refuse.  More than that, she had in her mind
another alternative which might in the end secure the heirloom to him, in spite of all.  As
she passed him, she said:

"At least we keep it in the parish.  If you don't have it, well, then..."

She paused, for she did not quite know what to say unless she spoke what was really in her
mind, and she dared not do that.

"But you ought to have an heirloom," she added, leaving unsaid what was her real thought and
hope.  With sudden inspiration, for he saw she was trying to make it easy for him, he drew
the great silver-watch from his pocket, which the head of the Barbilles had worn for generations,
and said:

"I have the only heirloom I could carry about with me.  It will keep time for me as long as
I'll last.  The Manor clock strikes the time for the world, and this watch is set by the Manor
clock."

"Well said--well and truly said, M'sieu' Jean Jacques," remarked the lean watchmaker and so-called
jeweller of Vilray, who stood near.  "It is a watch which couldn't miss the stroke of Judgment
Day."

It was at that moment, in the sunset hour, when the sale had drawn to a close, and the people
had begun to disperse, that the avocat of Vilray who represented the Big Financier came to
Jean Jacques and said:

"M'sieu', I have to say that there is due to you three hundred and fifty dollars from the settlement,
excluding this sale, which will just do what was expected of it.  I am instructed to give it
to you from the creditors.  Here it is."

He took out a roll of bills and offered it to Jean Jacques.

"What creditors?" asked Jean Jacques.

"All the creditors," responded the other, and he produced a receipt for Jean Jacques to sign.
"A formal statement will be sent you, and if there is any more due to you, it will be added
then.  But now--well, there it is, the creditors think there is no reason for you to wait."

Jean Jacques did not yet take the roll of bills.  "They come from M. Mornay?" he asked with
an air of resistance, for he did not wish to be under further obligations to the man who would
lose most by him.

The lawyer was prepared.  M. Mornay had foreseen the timidity and sensitiveness of Jean Jacques,
had anticipated his mistaken chivalry--for how could a man decline to take advantage of the
Bankruptcy Court unless he was another Don Quixote!  He had therefore arranged with all the
creditors for them to take responsibility with 'himself, though he provided the cash which
manipulated this settlement.

"No, M'sieu' Jean Jacques," the lawyer replied, this comes from all the creditors, as the sum
due to you from all the transactions, so far as can be seen as yet.  Further adjustment may
be necessary, but this is the interim settlement."

Jean Jacques was far from being ignorant of business, but so bemused was his judgment and his
intelligence now, that he did not see there was no balance which could possibly be his, since
his liabilities vastly exceeded his assets.  Yet with a wave of the hand he accepted the roll
of bills, and signed the receipt with an air which said, "These forms must be observed, I suppose."

What he would have done if the three hundred and fifty dollars had not been given him, it would
be hard to say, for with gentle asperity he had declined a loan from his friend M. Fille, and
he had but one silver dollar in his pocket, or in the world.  Indeed, Jean Jacques was living
in a dream in these dark days--a dream of renunciation and sacrifice, and in the spirit of
one who gives up all to some great cause.  He was not yet even face to face with the fulness
of his disaster.  Only at moments had the real significance of it all come to him, and then
he had shivered as before some terror menacing his path.  Also, as M. Mornay had said, his
philosophy was now in his bones and marrow rather than in his words. It had, after all, tinctured
his blood and impregnated his mind.  He had babbled and been the egotist, and played cock o'
the walk; and now at last his philosophy was giving some foundation for his feet.  Yet at this
auction-sale he looked a distracted, if smiling, whimsical, rather bustling figure of misfortune,
with a tragic air of exile, of isolation from all by which he was surrounded.  A profound and
wayworn loneliness showed in his figure, in his face, in his eyes.

The crowd thinned in time, and yet very many lingered to see the last of this drama of lost
fortunes.  A few of the riff-raff, who invariably attend these public scenes, were now rather
the worse for drink, from the indifferent liquor provided by the auctioneer, and they were
inclined to horseplay and coarse chaff.  More than one ribald reference to Jean Jacques had
been checked by his chivalrous fellow-citizens; indeed, M. Fille had almost laid himself open
to a charge of assault in his own court by raising his stick at a loafer, who made insulting
references to Jean Jacques.  But as the sale drew to a close, an air of rollicking humour among
the younger men would not be suppressed, and it looked as though Jean Jacques' exit would be
attended by the elements of farce and satire.

In this world, however, things do not happen logically, and Jean Jacques made his exit in a
wholly unexpected manner.  He was going away by the train which left a new railway junction
a few miles off, having gently yet firmly declined M. Fille's invitation, and also the invitations
of others--including the Cure and Mere Langlois--to spend the night with them and start off
the next day.  He elected to go on to Montreal that very night, and before the sale was quite
finished he prepared to start. His carpet-bag containing a few clothes and necessaries had
been sent on to the junction, and he meant to walk to the station in the cool of the evening.

M. Manotel, the auctioneer, hoarse with his heavy day's work, was announcing that there were
only a few more things to sell, and no doubt they could be had at a bargain, when Jean Jacques
began a tour of the Manor.  There was something inexpressibly mournful in this lonely pilgrimage
of the dismantled mansion.  Yet there was no show of cheap emotion by Jean Jacques; and a wave
of the hand prevented any one from following him in his dry-eyed progress to say farewell to
these haunts of childhood, manhood, family, and home.  There was a strange numbness in his
mind and body, and he had a feeling that he moved immense and reflective among material things.
Only tragedy can produce that feeling. Happiness makes the universe infinite and stupendous,
despair makes it small and even trivial.

It was when he had reached the little office where he had done the business of his life--a
kind of neutral place where he had ever isolated himself from the domestic scene--that the
final sensation, save one, of his existence at the Manor came to him.  Virginie Poucette had
divined his purpose when he began the tour of the house, and going by a roundabout way, she
had placed herself where she could speak with him alone before he left the place for ever--if
that was to be.  She was not sure that his exit was really inevitable--not yet.

When Jean Jacques saw Virginie standing beside the table in his office where he lead worked
over so many years, now marked Sold, and waiting to be taken away by its new owner, he started
and drew back, but she held out her hand and said:

"But one word, M'sieu' Jean Jacques; only one word from a friend--indeed a friend."

"A friend of friends," he answered, still in abstraction, his eyes having that burnished light
which belonged to the night of the fire; but yet realizing that she was a sympathetic soul
who had offered to lend him money without security.

"Oh, indeed yes, as good a friend as you can ever have!" she added.

Something had waked the bigger part of her, which had never been awake in the days of Palass
Poucette.  Jean Jacques was much older than she, but what she felt had nothing to do with age,
or place or station.  It had only to do with understanding, with the call of nature and of
a motherhood crying for expression.  Her heart ached for him.

"Well, good-bye, my friend," he said, and held out his hand.  "I must be going now."

"Wait," she said, and there was something insistent and yet pleading in her voice.  "I've got
something to say.  You must hear it.  .  .  .  Why should you go?  There is my farm--it needs
to be worked right.  It has got good chances.  It has water-power and wood and the best flax
in the province--they want to start a flax-mill on it--I've had letters from big men in Montreal.
Well, why shouldn't you do it instead?  There it is, the farm, and there am I a woman alone.
I need help.  I've got no head. I have to work at a sum of figures all night to get it straight.
.  .  . Ah, m'sieu', it is a need both sides!  You want someone to look after you; you want
a chance again to do things; but you want someone to look after you, and it is all waiting
there on the farm.  Palass Poucette left behind him seven sound horses, and cows and sheep,
and a threshing- machine and a fanning-mill, and no debts, and two thousand dollars in the
bank.  You will never do anything away from here.  You must stay here, where--where I can look
after you, Jean Jacques."

The light in his eyes flamed up, died down, flamed up again, and presently it covered all his
face, as he grasped what she meant.

"Wonder of God, do you forget?" he asked.  "I am married--married still, Virginie Poucette.
There is no divorce in the Catholic Church--no, none at all.  It is for ever and ever."

"I said nothing about marriage," she said bravely, though her face suffused.

"Hand of Heaven, what do you mean?  You mean to say you would do that for me in spite of the
Cure and--and everybody and everything?"

"You ought to be taken care of," she protested.  "You ought to have your chance again.  No
one here is free to do it all but me.  You are alone. Your wife that was--maybe she is dead.
I am alone, and I'm not afraid of what the good God will say.  I will settle with Him myself.
Well, then, do you think I'd care what--what Mere Langlois or the rest of the world would say?
.  .  .  I can't bear to think of you going away with nothing, with nobody, when here is something
and somebody--somebody who would be good to you.  Everybody knows that you've been badly used--
everybody.  I'm young enough to make things bright and warm in your life, and the place is
big enough for two, even if it isn't the Manor Cartier."

"Figure de Christ, do you think I'd let you do it--me?" declared Jean Jacques, with lips trembling
now and his shoulders heaving.  Misfortune and pain and penalty he could stand, but sacrifice
like this and--and whatever else it was, were too much for him.  They brought him back to the
dusty road and everyday life again; they subtracted him from his big dream, in which he had
been detached from the details of his catastrophe.

"No, no, no," he added.  "You go look another way, Virginie.  Turn your face to the young spring,
not to the dead winter.  To-morrow I'll be gone to find what I've got to find.  I've finished
here, but there's many a good man waiting for you--men who'll bring you something worth while
besides themselves.  Make no mistake, I've finished.  I've done my term of life.  I'm only
out on ticket-of-leave now--but there, enough, I shall always want to think of you.  I wish
I had something to give you--but yes, here is something."  He drew from his pocket a silver
napkin-ring. "I've had that since I was five years old.  My uncle Stefan gave it to me.  I've
always used it.  I don't know why I put it in my pocket this morning, but I did.  Take it.
It's more than money.  It's got something of Jean Jacques about it.  You've got the Barbille
fruit-dish-that is a thing I'll remember.  I'm glad you've got it, and--"

"I meant we should both eat from it," she said helplessly.

"It would cost too much to eat from it with you, Virginie--"

He stopped short, choked, then his face cleared, and his eyes became steady.

"Well then, good-bye, Virginie," he said, holding out his hand.

"You don't think I'd say to any other living man what I've said to you?" she asked.

He nodded understandingly.  "That's the best part of it.  It was for me of all the world,"
he answered.  "When I look back, I'll see the light in your window--the light you lit for the
lost one--for Jean Jacques Barbille."

Suddenly, with eyes that did not see and hands held out before him, he turned, felt for the
door and left the room.

She leaned helplessly against the table.  "The poor Jean Jacques--the poor Jean Jacques!" she
murmured.  "Cure or no Cure, I'd have done it," she declared, with a ring to her voice.  "Ah,
but Jean Jacques, come with me!" she added with a hungry and compassionate gesture, speaking
into space.  "I could make life worth while for us both."

A moment later Virginie was outside, watching the last act in the career of Jean Jacques in
the parish of St. Saviour's.

This was what she saw.

The auctioneer was holding up a bird-cage containing a canary-Carmen's bird-cage, and Zoe's
canary which had remained to be a vocal memory of her in her old home.

"Here," said the rhetorical, inflammable auctioneer, "here is the choicest lot left to the
last.  I put it away in the bakery, meaning to sell it at noon, when everybody was eating-food
for the soul and food for the body.  I forgot it.  But here it is, worth anything you like
to anybody that loves the beautiful, the good, and the harmonious.  What do I hear for this
lovely saffron singer from the Elysian fields?  What did the immortal poet of France say of
the bird in his garret, in 'L'Oiseau de Mon Crenier'?  What did he say:

                   'Sing me a song of the bygone hour,
                    A song of the stream and the sun;
                    Sing of my love in her bosky bower,
                    When my heart it was twenty-one.'

"Come now, who will renew his age or regale her youth with the divine notes of nature's minstrel?
Who will make me an offer for this vestal virgin of song--the joy of the morning and the benediction
of the evening?  What do I hear?  The best of the wine to the last of the feast! What do I
hear?--five dollars--seven dollars--nine dollars--going at nine dollars--ten dollars--Well,
ladies and gentlemen, the bird can sing--ah, voila !"

He stopped short for a moment, for as the evening sun swept its veil of rainbow radiance over
the scene, the bird began to sing.  Its little throat swelled, it chirruped, it trilled, it
called, it soared, it lost itself in a flood of ecstasy.  In the applausive silence, the emotional
recess of the sale, as it were, the man to whom the bird and the song meant most, pushed his
way up to the stand where M. Manotel stood.  When the people saw who it was, they fell back,
for there was that in his face which needed no interpretation.  It filled them with a kind of awe.

He reached up a brown, eager, affectionate hand--it had always been that --fat and small, but
rather fine and certainly emotional, though not material or sensual.

"Go on with your bidding," he said.

He was going to buy the thing which had belonged to his daughter, was beloved by her--the living
oracle of the morning, the muezzin of his mosque of home.  It had been to the girl who had
gone as another such a bird had been to the mother of the girl, the voice that sang, "Praise
God," in the short summer of that bygone happiness of his.  Even this cage and its homebird
were not his; they belonged to the creditors.

"Go on.  I buy--I bid," Jean Jacques said in a voice that rang.  It had no blur of emotion.
It had resonance.  The hammer that struck the bell of his voice was the hammer of memory, and
if it was plaintive it also was clear, and it was also vibrant with the silver of lost hopes.

M. Manotel humoured him, while the bird still sang.  "Four dollars--five dollars: do I hear
no more than five dollars?--going once, going twice, going three times--gone!" he cried, for
no one had made a further bid; and indeed M. Manotel would not have heard another voice than
Jean Jacques' if it had been as loud as the falls of the Saguenay.  He was a kind of poet in
his way, was M. Manotel.  He had been married four times, and he would be married again if
he had the chance; also he wrote verses for tombstones in the churchyard at St. Saviour's,
and couplets for fetes and weddings.

He handed the cage to Jean Jacques, who put it down on the ground at his feet, and in an instant
had handed up five dollars for one of the idols of his own altar.  Anyone else than M. Manotel,
or perhaps M. Fille or the New Cure, would have hesitated to take the five dollars, or, if
they had done so, would have handed it back; but they had souls to understand this Jean Jacques,
and they would not deny him his insistent independence.  And so, in a moment, he was making
his way out of the crowd with the cage in his hand, the bird silent now.

As he went, some one touched his arm and slipped a book into his hand. It was M. Fille, and
the book was his little compendium of philosophy which his friend had retrieved from his bedroom
in the early morning.

"You weren't going to forget it, Jean Jacques?" M. Fille said reproachfully.  "It is an old
friend.  It would not be happy with any one else."

Jean Jacques looked M. Fille in the eyes.  "Moi--je suis philosophe," he said without any of
the old insistence and pride and egotism, but as one would make an affirmation or repeat a creed.

"Yes, yes, to be sure, always, as of old," answered M. Fille firmly; for, from that formula
might come strength, when it was most needed, in a sense other and deeper far than it had been
or was now.  "You will remember that you will always know where to find us--eh?" added the
little Clerk of the Court.

The going of Jean Jacques was inevitable; all persuasion had failed to induce him to stay--even
that of Virginie; and M. Fille now treated it as though it was the beginning of a new career
for Jean Jacques, whatever that career might be.  It might be he would come back some day,
but not to things as they were, not ever again, nor as the same man.

"You will move on with the world outside there," continued M. Fille, "but we shall be turning
on the same swivel here always; and whenever you come--there, you understand.  With us it is
semper fidelis, always the same."

Jean Jacques looked at M. Fille again as though to ask him a question, but presently he shook
his head in negation to his thought.

"Well, good-bye," he said cheerfully--"A la bonne heure!"

By that M. Fille knew that Jean Jacques did not wish for company as he went--not even the company
of his old friend who had loved the bright whimsical emotional Zoe; who had hovered around
his life like a protecting spirit.

"A bi'tot," responded M. Fille, declining upon the homely patois.

But as Jean Jacques walked away with his little book of philosophy in his pocket, and the bird-cage
in his hand, someone sobbed.  M. Fille turned and saw.  It was Virginie Poucette.  Fortunately
for Virginie other women did the same, not for the same reason, but out of a sympathy which
was part of the scene.

It had been the intention of some friends of Jean Jacques to give him a cheer when he left,
and even his sullen local creditors, now that the worst had come, were disposed to give him
a good send-off; but the incident of the canary in its cage gave a turn to the feeling of the
crowd which could not be resisted.  They were not a people who could cut and dry their sentiments;
they were all impulse and simplicity, with an obvious cocksure shrewdness too, like that of
Jean Jacques--of the old Jean Jacques.  He had been the epitome of all their faults and all
their virtues.

No one cheered.  Only one person called, "Au 'voir, M'sieu' Jean Jacques!" and no one followed
him--a curious, assertive, feebly-brisk, shock-headed figure in the brown velveteen jacket,
which he had bought in Paris on his Grand Tour.

"What a ridiculous little man!" said a woman from Chalfonte over the water, who had been buying
freely all day for her new "Manor," her husband being a member of the provincial legislature.

The words were no sooner out of her mouth than two women faced her threateningly.

"For two pins I'd slap your face," said old Mere Langlois, her great breast heaving.  "Popinjay--you,
that ought to be in a cage like his canary."

But Virginie Poucette also was there in front of the offender, and she also had come from Chalfonte--was
born in that parish; and she knew what she was facing.

"Better carry a bird-cage and a book than carry swill to swine," she said; and madame from
Chalfonte turned white, for it had been said that her father was once a swine-herd, and that
she had tried her best to forget it when, with her coarse beauty, she married the well-to-do
farmer who was now in the legislature.

"Hold your tongues, all of you, and look at that," said M. Manotel, who had joined the agitated
group.  He was pointing towards the departing Jean Jacques, who was now away upon his road.

Jean Jacques had raised the cage on a level with his face, and was evidently speaking to the
bird in the way birds love--that soft kissing sound to which they reply with song.

Presently there came a chirp or two, and then the bird thrust up its head, and out came the
full blessedness of its song, exultant, home-like, intimate.

Jean Jacques walked on, the bird singing by his side; and he did not look back.

CHAPTER XXI

IF SHE HAD KNOWN IN TIME

Nothing stops when we stop for a time, or for all time, except ourselves. Everything else goes
on--not in the same way; but it does go on.  Life did not stop at St. Saviour's after Jean
Jacques made his exit.  Slowly the ruined mill rose up again, and very slowly indeed the widow
of Palass Poucette recovered her spirits, though she remained a widow in spite of all appeals;
but M. Fille and his sister never were the same after they lost their friend.  They had great
comfort in the dog which Jean Jacques had given to them, and they roused themselves to a malicious
pleasure when Bobon, as he had been called by Zoe, rushed out at the heels of an importunate
local creditor who had greatly worried Jean Jacques at the last.  They waited in vain for a
letter from Jean Jacques, but none came; nor did they hear anything from him, or of him, for
a long, long time.

Jean Jacques did not mean that they should.  When he went away with his book of philosophy
and his canary he had but one thing in his mind, and that was to find Zoe and make her understand
that he knew he had been in the wrong.  He had illusions about starting life again, in which
he probably did not believe; but the make-believe was good for him.  Long before the crash
came, in Zoe's name--not his own--he had bought from the Government three hundred and twenty
acres of land out near the Rockies and had spent five hundred dollars in improvements on it.

There it was in the West, one remaining asset still his own--or rather Zoe's--but worth little
if he or she did not develop it.  As he left St. Saviour's, however, he kept fixing his mind
on that "last domain," as he called it to himself.  If this was done intentionally, that he
might be saved from distraction and despair, it was well done; if it was a real illusion--the
old self-deception which had been his bane so often in the past--it still could only do him
good at the present.  It prevented him from noticing the attention he attracted on the railway
journey from St. Saviour's to Montreal, cherishing his canary and his book as he went.

He was not so self-conscious now as in the days when he was surprised that Paris did not stop
to say, "Bless us, here is that fine fellow, Jean Jacques Barbille of St. Saviour's!" He could
concentrate himself more now on things that did not concern the impression he was making on
the world.  At present he could only think of Zoe and of her future.

When a patronizing and aggressive commercial traveller in the little hotel on a side-street
where he had taken a room in Montreal said to him, "Bien, mon vieux" (which is to say, "Well,
old cock"), "aren't you a long way from home?" something of a new dignity came into Jean Jacques'
bearing, very different from the assurance of the old days, and in reply he said:

"Not so far that I need be careless about my company."  This made the landlady of the little
hotel laugh quite hard, for she did not like the braggart "drummer" who had treated her with
great condescension for a number of years.  Also Madame Glozel liked Jean Jacques because of
his canary.  She thought there must be some sentimental reason for a man of fifty or more carrying
a bird about with him; and she did not rest until she had drawn from Jean Jacques that he was
taking the bird to his daughter in the West.  There, however, madame was stayed in her search
for information.  Jean Jacques closed up, and did but smile when she adroitly set traps for
him, and at last asked him outright where his daughter was.

Why he waited in Montreal it would be hard to say, save that it was a kind of middle place
between the old life and the new, and also because he must decide what was to be his plan of
search.  First the West--first Winnipeg, but where after that?  He had at last secured information
of where Zoe and Gerard Fynes had stayed while in Montreal; and now he followed clues which
would bring him in touch with folk who knew them. He came to know one or two people who were
with Zoe and Gerard in the last days they spent in the metropolis, and he turned over and over
in his mind every word said about his girl, as a child turns a sweetmeat in its mouth.  This
made him eager to be off; but on the very day he decided to start at once for the West, something
strange happened.

It was towards the late afternoon of a Saturday, when the streets were full of people going
to and from the shops in a marketing quarter, that Madame Glozel came to him and said:

"M'sieu', I have an idea, and you will not think it strange, for you have a kind heart.  There
is a woman--look you, it is a sad, sad story hers. She is ill and dying in a room a little
way down the street.  But yes, I am sure she is dying--of heart disease it is.  She came here
first when the illness took her, but she could not afford to stay.  She went to those cheaper
lodgings down the street.  She used to be on the stage over in the States, and then she came
back here, and there was a man-- married to him or not I do not know, and I will not think.
Well, the man--the brute--he left her when she got ill--but yes, forsook her absolutely!  He
was a land-agent or something like that, and all very fine to your face, to promise and to
pretend--just make-believe.  When her sickness got worse, off he went with 'Au revoir, my dear--I
will be back to supper.'  Supper!  If she'd waited for her supper till he came back, she'd
have waited as long as I've done for the fortune the gipsy promised me forty years ago.  Away
he went, the rogue, without a thought of her, and with another woman.  That's what hurt her
most of all. Straight from her that could hardly drag herself about--ah, yes, and has been
as handsome a woman as ever was!--straight from her he went to a slut.  She was a slut, m'sieu'--did
I not know her?  Did Ma'm'selle Slut not wait at table in this house and lead the men a dance
here night and day-day and night till I found it out!  Well, off he went with the slut, and
left the lady behind.  .  .  .  You men, you treat women so."

Jean Jacques put out a hand as though to argue with her.  "Sometimes it is the other way,"
he retorted.  "Most of us have seen it like that."

"Well, for sure, you're right enough there, m'sieu'," was the response. "I've got nothing to
say to that, except that it's a man that runs away with a woman, or that gets her to leave
her husband when she does go. There's always a man that says, 'Come along, I'm the better chap
for you.'"

Jean Jacques wearily turned his head away towards the cage where his canary was beginning to
pipe its evening lay.

"It all comes to the same thing in the end," he said pensively; and then he who had been so
quiet since he came to the little hotel--Glozel's, it was called--began to move about the room
excitedly, running his fingers through his still bushy hair, which, to his credit, was always
as clean as could be, burnished and shiny even at his mid-century period. He began murmuring
to himself, and a frown settled on his fore head. Mme. Glozel saw that she had perturbed him,
and that no doubt she had roused some memories which made sombre the sunny little room where
the canary sang; where, to ravish the eyes of the pessimist, was a picture of Louis XVI.  going
to heaven in the arms of St. Peter.

When started, however, the good woman could no more "slow down" than her French pony would
stop when its head was turned homewards from market. So she kept on with the history of the
woman down the street.

"Heart disease," she said, nodding with assurance and finality; "and we know what that is--a
start, a shock, a fall, a strain, and pht! off the poor thing goes.  Yes, heart disease, and
sometimes with such awful pain. But so; and yesterday she told me she had only a hundred dollars
left. 'Enough to last me through,' she said to me.  Poor thing, she lifted up her eyes with
a way she has, as if looking for something she couldn't find, and she says, as simple as though
she was asking about the price of a bed-tick, 'It won't cost more than fifty dollars to bury
me, I s'pose?' Well, that made me squeamish, for the poor dear's plight came home to me so
clear, and she young enough yet to get plenty out of life, if she had the chance.  So I asked
her again about her people--whether I couldn't send for someone belonging to her.  'There's
none that belongs to me,' she says, 'and there's no one I belong to.'

"I thought very likely she didn't want to tell me about herself; perhaps because she had done
wrong, and her family had not been good to her.  Yet it was right I should try and get her
folks to come, if she had any folks.  So I said to her, 'Where was your home?'  And now, what
do you think she answered, m'sieu'?'  'Look there,' she said to me, with her big eyes standing
out of her head almost--for that's what comes to her sometimes when she is in pain, and she
looks more handsome then than at any other time--'Look there,' she said to me, 'it was in heaven,
that's where--my home was; but I didn't know it.  I hadn't been taught to know the place when
I saw it.'

"Well, I felt my skin go goosey, for I saw what was going on in her mind, and how she was remembering
what had happened to her some time, somewhere; but there wasn't a tear in her eyes, and I never
saw her cry- never once, m'sieu'--well, but as brave as brave.  Her eyes are always dry--burning.
They're like two furnaces scorching up her face.  So I never found out her history, and she
won't have the priest.  I believe that's because she wants to die unknown, and doesn't want
to confess. I never saw a woman I was sorrier for, though I think she wasn't married to the
man that left her.  But whatever she was, there's good in her--I haven't known hundreds of
women and had seven sisters for nothing.  Well, there she is--not a friend near her at the
last; for it's coming soon, the end--no one to speak to her, except the woman she pays to come
in and look after her and nurse her a bit.  Of course there's the landlady too, Madame Popincourt,
a kind enough little cricket of a woman, but with no sense and no head for business.  And so
the poor sick thing has not a single pleasure in the world.  She can't read, because it makes
her head ache, she says; and she never writes to any one.  One day she tried to sing a little,
but it seemed to hurt her, and she stopped before she had begun almost.  Yes, m'sieu', there
she is without a single pleasure in the long hours when she doesn't sleep."

"There's my canary--that would cheer her up," eagerly said Jean Jacques, who, as the story
of the chirruping landlady continued, became master of his agitation, and listened as though
to the tale of some life for which he had concern.  "Yes, take my canary to her, madame.  It
picked me up when I was down.  It'll help her--such a bird it is!  It's the best singer in
the world.  It's got in its throat the music of Malibran and Jenny Lind and Grisi, and all
the stars in heaven that sang together. Also, to be sure, it doesn't charge anything, but just
as long as there's daylight it sings and sings, as you know."

"M'sieu'--oh, m'sieu', it was what I wanted to ask you, and I didn't dare!" gushingly declared
madame.  "I never heard a bird sing like that --just as if it knew how much good it was doing,
and with all the airs of a grand seigneur.  It's a prince of birds, that.  If you mean it,
m'sieu', you'll do as good a thing as you have ever done."

"It would have to be much better, or it wouldn't be any use," remarked Jean Jacques.

The woman made a motion of friendliness with both hands.  "I don't believe that.  You may be
queer, but you've got a kind eye.  It won't be for long she'll need the canary, and it will
cheer her.  There certainly was never a bird so little tied to one note.  Now this note, now
that, and so amusing.  At times it's as though he was laughing at you."

"That's because, with me for his master, he has had good reason to laugh," remarked Jean Jacques,
who had come at last to take a despondent view of himself.

"That's bosh," rejoined Mme. Glozel; "I've seen several people odder than you."

She went over to the cage eagerly, and was about to take it away. "Excuse me," interposed Jean
Jacques, "I will carry the cage to the house.  Then you will go in with the bird, and I'll
wait outside and see if the little rascal sings."

"This minute?" asked madame.

"For sure, this very minute.  Why should the poor lady wait?  It's a lonely time of day, this,
the evening, when the long night's ahead."

A moment later the two were walking along the street to the door of Mme. Popincourt's lodgings,
and people turned to look at the pair, one carrying something covered with a white cloth, evidently
a savoury dish of some kind--the other with a cage in which a handsome canary hopped about,
well pleased with the world.

At Mme.  Popincourt's door Mme.  Glozel took the cage and went upstairs. Jean Jacques, left
behind, paced backwards and forwards in front of the house waiting and looking up, for Mme.
Glozel had said that behind the front window on the third floor was where the sick woman lived.
He had not long to wait.  The setting sun shining full on the window had roused the bird, and
he began to pour out a flood of delicious melody which flowed on and on, causing the people
in the street to stay their steps and look up.  Jean Jacques' face, as he listened, had something
very like a smile.  There was that in the smile belonging to the old pride, which in days gone
by had made him say when he looked at his domains at the Manor Cartier--his houses, his mills,
his store, his buildings and his lands--"It is all mine.  It all belongs to Jean Jacques Barbille."

Suddenly, however, there came a sharp pause in the singing, and after that a cry--a faint,
startled cry.  Then Mme.  Glozel's head was thrust out of the window three floors up, and she
called to Jean Jacques to come quickly.  As she bade him come, some strange premonition flashed
to Jean Jacques, and with thumping heart he hastened up the staircase.  Outside a bedroom door,
Mme.  Glozel met him.  She was so excited she could only whisper.

"Be very quiet," she said.  "There is something strange.  When the bird sang as it did--you
heard it--she sat like one in a trance.  Then her face took on a look glad and frightened too,
and she stared hard at the cage.  'Bring that cage to me,' she said.  I brought it.  She looked
sharp at it, then she gave a cry and fell back.  As I took the cage away I saw what she had
been looking at--a writing at the bottom of the cage. It was the name Carmen."

With a stifled cry Jean Jacques pushed her aside and entered the room. As he did so, the sick
woman in the big armchair, so pale yet so splendid in her death-beauty, raised herself up.
With eyes that Francesca might have turned to the vision of her fate, she looked at the opening
door, as though to learn if he who came was one she had wished to see through long, relentless
days.

"Jean Jacques--ah, my beautiful Jean Jacques!" she cried out presently in a voice like a wisp
of sound, for she had little breath; and then with a smile she sank back, too late to hear,
but not too late to know, what Jean Jacques said to her.
