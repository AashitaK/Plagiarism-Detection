I. AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL APPROACHES

I.

As the train took its time and ours in mounting the uplands toward Granada on the soft, but
not too soft, evening of November 6, 1911, the air that came to me through the open window
breathed as if from an autumnal night of the middle eighteen-fifties in a little village of
northeastern Ohio. I was now going to see, for the first time, the city where so great a part
of my life was then passed, and in this magical air the two epochs were blent in reciprocal
association. The question of my present identity was a thing indifferent and apart; it did
not matter who or where or when I was. Youth and age were at one with each other: the boy abiding
in the old man, and the old man pensively willing to dwell for the enchanted moment in any
vantage of the past which would give him shelter.

In that dignified and deliberate Spanish train I was a man of seventy-four crossing the last
barrier of hills that helped keep Granada from her conquerors, and at the same time I was a
boy of seventeen in the little room under the stairs in a house now practically remoter than
the Alhambra, finding my unguided way through some Spanish story of the vanished kingdom of
the Moors. The little room which had structurally ceased fifty years before from the house
that ceased to be home even longer ago had returned to the world with me in it, and fitted
perfectly into the first-class railway compartment which my luxury had provided for it. From
its window I saw through the car window the olive groves and white cottages of the Spanish
peasants, and the American apple orchards and meadows stretching to the primeval woods that
walled the drowsing village round. Then, as the night deepened with me at my book, the train
slipped slowly from the hills, and the moon, leaving the Ohio village wholly in the dark, shone
over the roofs and gardens of Granada, and I was no longer a boy of seventeen, but altogether
a man of seventy-four.

I do not say the experience was so explicit as all this; no experience so mystical could be
so explicit; and perhaps what was intimated to me in it was only that if I sometime meant to
ask some gentle reader's company in a retrospect of my Spanish travels, I had better be honest
with him and own at the beginning that passion for Spanish things which was the ruling passion
of my boyhood; I had better confess that, however unrequited, it held me in the eager bondage
of a lover still, so that I never wished to escape from it, but must try to hide the fact whenever
the real Spain fell below the ideal, however I might reason with my infatuation or try to scoff
it away. It had once been so inextinguishable a part of me that the record of my journey must
be more or less autobiographical; and though I should decently endeavor to keep my past out
of it, perhaps I should not try very hard and should not always succeed.

Just when this passion began in me I should not be able to say; but probably it was with my
first reading of Don Quixote in the later eighteen-forties. I would then have been ten or twelve
years old; and, of course, I read that incomparable romance, not only greatest, but sole of
its kind, in English. The purpose of some time reading it in Spanish and then the purpose of
some time writing the author's life grew in me with my growing years so strongly that, though
I have never yet done either and probably never shall, I should not despair of doing both if
I lived to be a hundred. In the mean time my wandering steps had early chanced upon a Spanish
grammar, and I had begun those inquiries in it which were based upon a total ignorance of English
accidence. I do not remember how I felt my way from it to such reading of the language as has
endeared Spanish literature to me. It embraced something of everything: literary and political
history, drama, poetry, fiction; but it never condescended to the exigencies of common parlance.
These exigencies did not exist for me in my dreams of seeing Spain which were not really expectations.
It was not until half a century later, when my longing became a hope and then a purpose, that
I foreboded the need of practicable Spanish. Then I invoked the help of a young professor,
who came to me for an hour each day of a week in London and let me try to talk with him; but
even then I accumulated so little practicable Spanish that my first hour, almost my first moment
in Spain, exhausted my store. My professor was from Barcelona, but he beautifully lisped his
c's and z's like any old Castilian, when he might have hissed them in the accent of his native
Catalan; and there is no telling how much I might have profited by his instruction if he had
not been such a charming intelligence that I liked to talk with him of literature and philosophy
and politics rather than the weather, or the cost of things, or the question of how long the
train stopped and when it would start, or the dishes at table, or clothes at the tailor's,
or the forms of greeting and parting. If he did not equip me with the useful colloquial phrases,
the fault was mine; and the misfortune was doubly mine when from my old acquaintance with Italian
(glib half-sister of the statelier Spanish) the Italian phrases would thrust forward as the
equivalent of the English words I could not always think of. The truth is, then, that I was
not perfect in my Spanish after quite six weeks in Spain; and if in the course of his travels
with me the reader finds me flourishing Spanish idioms in his face he may safely attribute
them less to my speaking than my reading knowledge: probably I never employed them in conversation.
That reading was itself without order or system, and I am not sure but it had better been less
than more. Yet who knows? The days, or the nights of the days, in the eighteen-fifties went
quickly, as quickly as the years go now, and it would have all come to the present pass whether
that blind devotion to an alien literature had cloistered my youth or not.

I do not know how, with the merciful make I am of, I should then have cared so little, or else
ignored so largely the cruelties I certainly knew that the Spaniards had practised in the conquests
of Mexico and Peru. I knew of these things, and my heart was with the Incas and the Aztecs,
and yet somehow I could not punish the Spaniards for their atrocious destruction of the only
American civilizations. As nearly as I can now say, I was of both sides, and wistful to reconcile
them, though I do not see now how it could have been done; and in my later hopes for the softening
of the human conditions I have found it hard to forgive Pizarro for the overthrow of the most
perfectly socialized state known to history. I scarcely realized the base ingratitude of the
Spanish sovereigns to Columbus, and there were vast regions of history that I had not penetrated
till long afterward in pursuit of Spanish perfidy and inhumanity, as in their monstrous misrule
of Holland. When it came in those earlier days to a question of sides between the Spaniards
and the Moors, as Washington Irving invited my boyhood to take it in his chronicle of the conquest
of Granada, I experienced on a larger scale my difficulty in the case of the Mexicans and Peruvians.
The case of these had been reported to me in the school-readers, but here, now, was an affair
submitted to the mature judgment of a boy of twelve, and yet I felt as helpless as I was at
ten. Will it be credited that at seventy-four I am still often in doubt which side I should
have had win, though I used to fight on both? Since the matter was settled more than four hundred
years ago, I will not give the reasons for my divided allegiance. They would hardly avail now
to reverse the tragic fate of the Moors, and if I try I cannot altogether wish to reverse it.
Whatever Spanish misrule has been since Islam was overthrown in Granada, it has been the error
of law, and the rule of Islam at the best had always been the effect of personal will, the
caprice of despots high and low, the unstatuted sufferance of slaves, high and low. The gloomiest
and cruelest error of Inquisitional Spain was nobler, with its adoration of ideal womanhood,
than the Mohammedan state with its sensual dreams of Paradise. I will not pretend (as I very
well might, and as I perhaps ought) that I thought of these things, all or any, as our train
began to slope rather more rapidly toward Granada, and to find its way under the rising moon
over the storied Vega. I will as little pretend that my attitude toward Spain was ever that
of the impartial observer after I crossed the border of that enchanted realm where we all have
our castles. I have thought it best to be open with the reader here at the beginning, and I
would not, if I could, deny him the pleasure of doubting my word or disabling my judgment at
any point he likes. In return I shall only ask his patience when I strike too persistently
the chord of autobiography. That chord is part of the harmony between the boy and the old man
who made my Spanish journey together, and were always accusing themselves, the first of dreaming
and the last of doddering: perhaps with equal justice. Is there really much difference between
the two?

II.

It was fully a month before that first night in Granada that I arrived in Spain after some
sixty years' delay. During this period I had seen almost every other interesting country in
Europe. I had lived five or six years in Italy; I had been several months in Germany; and a
fortnight in Holland; I had sojourned often in Paris; I had come and gone a dozen times in
England and lingered long each time; and yet I had never once visited the land of my devotion.
I had often wondered at this, it was so wholly involuntary, and I had sometimes suffered from
the surprise of those who knew of my passion for Spain, and kept finding out my dereliction,
alleging the Sud-Express to Madrid as something that left me without excuse. The very summer
before last I got so far on the way in London as to buy a Spanish phrase-book full of those
inopportune conversations with landlords, tailors, ticket-sellers, and casual acquaintance
or agreeable strangers. Yet I returned once more to America with my desire, which was turning
into a duty, unfulfilled; and when once more I sailed for Europe in 1911 it was more with foreboding
of another failure than a prescience of fruition in my inveterate longing. Even after that
boldly decisive week of the professor in London I had my doubts and my self-doubts. There were
delays at London, delays at Paris, delays at Tours; and when at last we crossed the Pyrenees
and I found myself in Spain, it was with an incredulity which followed me throughout and lingered
with me to the end. "Is this truly Spain, and am I actually there?" the thing kept asking itself;
and it asks itself still, in terms that fit the accomplished fact.

II. SAN SEBASTIAN AND BEAUTIFUL BISCAY

Even at Irun, where we arrived in Spain from Bayonne, there began at once to be temperamental
differences which ought to have wrought against my weird misgivings of my whereabouts. Only
in Spain could a customs inspector have felt of one tray in our trunks and then passed them
all with an air of such jaded aversion from an employ uncongenial to a gentleman. Perhaps he
was also loath to attempt any inquiry in that Desperanto of French, English, and Spanish which
raged around us; but the porter to whom we had fallen, while I hesitated at our carriage door
whether I should summon him as Mozo or Usted, was master of that lingua franca and recovered
us from the customs without question on our part, and understood everything we could not, say.
I like to think he was a Basque, because I like the Basques so much for no reason that I can
think of. Their being always Carlists would certainly be no reason with me, for I was never
a Carlist; and perhaps my liking is only a prejudice in their favor from the air of thrift
and work which pervades their beautiful province, or is an effect of their language as I first
saw it inscribed on the front of the Credit Lyonnais at Bayonne. It looked so beautifully regular,
so scholarly, so Latin, so sister to both Spanish and Italian, so richly and musically voweled,
and yet remained so impenetrable to the most daring surmise, that I conceived at once a profound
admiration for the race which could keep such a language to itself. When I remembered how blond,
how red-blond our sinewy young porter was, I could not well help breveting him of that race,
and honoring him because he could have read those words with the eyes that were so blue amid
the general Spanish blackness of eyes. He imparted a quiet from his own calm to our nervousness,
and if we had appealed to him on the point I am sure he would have saved us from the error
of breakfasting in the station restaurant at the deceitful table d'hote, though where else
we should have breakfasted I do not know.

I.

One train left for San Sebastian while I was still lost in amaze that what I had taken into
my mouth for fried egg should be inwardly fish and full of bones; but he quelled my anxiety
with the assurance, which I somehow understood, that there would be another train soon. In
the mean time there were most acceptable Spanish families all about, affably conversing together,
and freely admitting to their conversation the children, who so publicly abound in Spain, and
the nurses who do nothing to prevent their publicity. There were already the typical fat Spanish
mothers and lean fathers, with the slender daughters, who, in the tradition of Spanish good-breeding,
kept their black eyes to themselves, or only lent them to the spectators in furtive glances.
Both older and younger ladies wore the scanty Egyptian skirt of Occidental civilization, lurking
or perking in deep-drooping or high-raking hats, though already here and there was the mantilla,
which would more and more prevail as we went southward; older and younger, they were all painted
and powdered to the favor that Spanish women everywhere corne to.

When the bad breakfast was over, and the waiters were laying the table for another as bad,
our Basque porter came in and led us to the train for San Sebastian which he had promised us.
It was now raining outside, and we were glad to climb into our apartment without at all seeing
what Irun was or was not like. But we thought well of the place because we first experienced
there the ample ease of a Spanish car. In Spain the railroad gauge is five feet six inches;
and this car of ours was not only very spacious, but very clean, while the French cars that
had brought us from Bordeaux to Bayonne and from Bayonne to Irun were neither. I do not say
all French cars are dirty, or all Spanish cars are as clean as they are spacious. The cars
of both countries are hard to get into, by steep narrow footholds worse even than our flights
of steps; in fact, the English cars are the only ones I know which are easy of access. But
these have not the ample racks for hand-bags which the Spanish companies provide for travelers
willing to take advantage of their trust by transferring much of their heavy stuff to them.
Without owning that we were such travelers, I find this the place to say that, with the allowance
of a hundred and thirty-two pounds free, our excess baggage in two large steamer-trunks did
not cost us three dollars in a month's travel, with many detours, from Irun in the extreme
north to Algeciras in the extreme south of Spain.

II.

But in this sordid detail I am keeping the reader from the scenery. It had been growing more
and more striking ever since we began climbing into the Pyrenees from Bayonne; but upon the
whole it was not so sublime as it was beautiful. There were some steep, sharp peaks, but mostly
there were grassy valleys with white cattle grazing in them, and many fields of Indian corn,
endearingly homelike. This at least is mainly the trace that the scenery as far as Irun has
left among my notes; and after Irun there is record of more and more corn. There was, in fact,
more corn than anything else, though there were many orchards, also endearingly homelike, with
apples yellow and red showing among the leaves still green on the trees; if there had been
something more wasteful in the farming it would have been still more homelike, but a traveler
cannot have everything. The hillsides were often terraced, as in Italy, and the culture apparently
close and conscientious. The farmhouses looked friendly and comfortable; at places the landscape
was molested by some sort of manufactories which could not conceal their tall chimneys, though
they kept the secret of their industry. They were never, really, very bad, and I would have
been willing to let them pass for fulling-mills, such as I was so familiar with in Don Quixote,
if I had thought of these in time. But one ought to be honest at any cost, and I must own that
the Spain I was now for the first time seeing with every-day eyes was so little like the Spain
of my boyish vision that I never once recurred to it. That was a Spain of cork-trees, of groves
by the green margins of mountain brooks, of habitable hills, where shepherds might feed their
flocks and mad lovers and maids forlorn might wander and maunder; and here were fields of corn
and apple orchards and vineyards reddening and yellowing up to the doors of those comfortable
farmhouses, with nowhere the sign of a Christian cavalier or a turbaned infidel. As a man I
could not help liking what I saw, but I could also grieve for the boy who would have been so
disappointed if he had come to the Basque provinces of Spain when he was from ten to fifteen
years old, instead of seventy-four.

It took our train nearly an hour to get by twenty miles of those pleasant farms and the pretty
hamlets which they now and then clustered into. But that was fast for a Spanish way-train,
which does not run, but, as it were, walks with dignity and makes long stops at stations, to
rest and let the locomotive roll itself a cigarette. By the time we reached San Sebastian our
rain had thickened to a heavy downpour, and by the time we mounted to our rooms, three pair
up in the hotel, it was storming in a fine fury over the bay under them, and sweeping the curving
quays and tossing the feathery foliage of the tamarisk-shaded promenade. The distinct advantage
of our lofty perch was the splendid sight of the tempest, held from doing its worst by the
mighty headlands standing out to sea on the right and left. But our rooms were cold with the
stony cold of the south when it is cooling off from its summer, and we shivered in the splendid
sight.

III.

The inhabitants of San Sebastian will not hesitate to say that it is the prettiest town in
Spain, and I do not know that they could be hopefully contradicted. It is very modern in its
more obvious aspects, with a noble thoroughfare called the Avenida de Libertad for its principal
street, shaded with a double row of those feathery tamarisks, and with handsome shops glittering
on both sides of it. Very easily it is first of the fashionable watering-places of Spain; the
King has his villa there, and the court comes every summer. But they had gone by the time we
got there, and the town wore the dejected look of out-of-season summer resorts; though there
was the apparatus of gaiety, the fine casino at one end of the beach, and the villas of the
rich and noble all along it to the other end. On the sand were still many bathing-machines,
but many others had begun to climb for greater safety during the winter to the street above.
We saw one hardy bather dripping up from the surf and seeking shelter among those that remained,
but they were mostly tenanted by their owners, who looked shoreward through their open doors,
and made no secret of their cozy domesticity, where they sat and sewed or knitted and gossiped
with their neighbors. Good wives and mothers they doubtless were, but no doubt glad to be resting
from the summer pleasure of others. They had their beautiful names written up over their doors,
and were for the service of the lady visitors only; there were other machines for gentlemen,
and no doubt it was their owners whom we saw gathering the fat seaweed thrown up by the storm
into the carts drawn by oxen over the sand. The oxen wore no yokes, but pulled by a band drawn
over their foreheads under their horns, and they had the air of not liking the arrangement;
though, for the matter of that, I have never seen oxen that seemed to like being yoked.

When we came down to dinner we found the tables fairly full of belated visitors, who presently
proved tourists flying south like ourselves. The dinner was good, as it is in nearly all Spanish
hotels, where for an average of three dollars a day you have an inclusive rate which you must
double for as good accommodation in our States. Let no one, I say, fear the rank cookery so
much imagined of the Peninsula, the oil, the pepper, the kid and the like strange meats; as
in all other countries of Europe, even England itself, there is a local version, a general
convention of the French cuisine, quite as good in Spain as elsewhere, and oftener superabundant
than subabundant. The plain water is generally good, With an American edge of freshness; but
if you will not trust it (we had to learn to trust it) there are agreeable Spanish mineral
waters, as well as the Apollinaris, the St. Galmier, and the Perrier of other civilizations,
to be had for the asking, at rather greater cost than the good native wines, often included
in the inclusive rate.

Besides this convention of the French cuisine there is almost everywhere a convention of the
English language in some one of the waiters. You must not stray far from the beaten path of
your immediate wants, but in this you are safe. At San Sebastian we had even a wider range
with the English of the little intellectual-looking, pale Spanish waiter, with a fine Napoleonic
head, who came to my help when I began to flounder in the language which I had read so much
and spoken so little or none. He had been a year in London, he said, and he took us for English,
though, now he came to notice it, he perceived we were Americans because we spoke "quicklier"
than the English. We did not protest; it was the mildest criticism of our national accent which
we were destined to get from English-speaking Spaniards before they found we were not the English
we did not wish to be taken for. After dinner we asked for a fire in one of our grates, but
the maid declared there was no fuel; and, though the hostess denied this and promised us a
fire the next night, she forgot it till nine o'clock, and then we would not have it. The cold
abode with us indoors to the last at San Sebastian, but the storm (which had hummed and whistled
theatrically at our windows) broke during the first night, and the day followed with several
intervals of sunshine, which bathed us in a glowing-expectation of overtaking the fugitive
summer farther south.

IV.

In the mean time we hired a beautiful Basque cabman with a red Basque cap and high-hooked Basque
nose to drive us about at something above the legal rate and let us not leave any worthy thing
in San Sebastian unseen. He took us, naturally, to several churches, old and new, with their
Gothic and rococo interiors, which I still find glooming and glinting among my evermore thickening
impressions of like things. We got from them the sense of that architectural and sculptural
richness which the interior of no Spanish church ever failed measurably to give; but what their
historical associations were I will not offer to say. The associations of San Sebastian with
the past are in all things vague, at least for me. She was indeed taken from the French by
the English under Wellington during the Peninsular War, but of older, if not unhappier farther-off
days and battles longer ago her history as I know it seems to know little. It knows of savage
and merciless battles between the partisans of Don Carlos and those of Queen Isabella so few
decades since as not to be the stuff of mere pathos yet, and I am not able to blink the fact
that my beloved Basques fought on the wrong side, when they need not have fought at all. Why
they were Carlists they could perhaps no more say than I could. The monumental historic fact
is that the Basques have been where they are immeasurably beyond the memories of other men;
what the scope of their own memories is one could perhaps confidently say only in Basque if
one could say anything. Of course, in the nature of things, the Phoenicians must have been
there and the Greeks, doubtless, if they ever got outside of the Pillars of Hercules; the Romans,
of course, must have settled and civilized and then Christianized the province. It is next
neighbor to that province of Asturias in which alone the Arabs failed to conquer the Goths,
and from which Spain was to live and grow again and recover all her losses from the Moors;
but what the share of San Sebastian was in this heroic fate, again I must leave the Basques
to say. They would doubtless say it with sufficient self-respect, for wherever we came in contact
that day with the Basque nature we could not help imagining in it a sense of racial merit equaling
that of the Welsh themselves, who are indeed another branch of the same immemorial Iberian
stock, if the Basques are Iberians. Like the Welsh, they have the devout tradition that they
never were conquered, but yielded to circumstances when these became too strong for them.

Among the ancient Spanish liberties which were restricted by the consolidating monarchy from
age to age, the Basque fueros, or rights, were the oldest; they lasted quite to our own day;
and although it is known to more ignorant men that these privileges (including immunity from
conscription) have now been abrogated, the custodian of the House of Provincial Deputies, whom
our driver took us to visit, was such a glowing Basque patriot that he treated them as in full
force. His pride in the seat of the local government spared us no detail of the whole electric-lighting
system, or even the hose-bibs for guarding the edifice against fire, let alone every picture
and photograph on the wall of every chamber of greater or less dignity, with every notable
table and chair. He certainly earned the peseta I gave him, but he would have done far more
for it if we had suffered him to take us up another flight of stairs; and he followed us in
our descent with bows and adieux that ought to have left no doubt in our minds of the persistence
of the Basque fueros.

V.

It was to such a powerful embodiment of the local patriotism that our driver had brought us
from another civic palace overlooking the Plaza de la Constitution, chiefly notable now for
having been the old theater of the bull-fights. The windows in the houses round still bear
the numbers by which they were sold to spectators as boxes; but now the municipality has built
a beautiful brand-new bull-ring in San Sebastian; and I do not know just why we were required
to inspect the interior of the edifice overlooking this square. I only know that at sight of
our bewilderment a workman doing something to the staircase clapped his hands orientally, and
the custodian was quickly upon us in response to a form of summons which we were to find so
often used in Spain. He was not so crushingly upon us as that other custodian; he was apologetically
proud, rather than boastfully; at times he waved his hands in deprecation, and would have made
us observe that the place was little, very little; he deplored it like a host who wishes his
possessions praised. Among the artistic treasures of the place from which he did not excuse
us there were some pen-drawings, such as writing-masters execute without lifting the pen from
the paper, by a native of South America, probably of Basque descent, since the Basques have
done so much to people that continent. We not only admired these, but we would not consent
to any of the custodian's deprecations, especially when it came to question of the pretty salon
in which Queen Victoria was received on her first visit to San Sebastian. We supposed then,
and in fact I had supposed till this moment, that it was Queen Victoria of Great Britain who
was meant; but now I realize that it must have been the queen consort of Spain, who seems already
to have made herself so liked there.

She, of course, comes every summer to San Sebastian, and presently our driver took us to see
the royal villa by the shore, withdrawn, perhaps from a sense of its extreme plainness, not
to say ugliness, among its trees and vines behind its gates and walls. Our driver excused himself
for not being able to show us through it; he gladly made us free of an unrestricted view of
the royal bathing-pavilion, much more frankly splendid in its gilding, beside the beach. Other
villas ranked themselves along the hillside, testifying to the gaiety of the social life in
summers past and summers to come. In the summer just past the gaiety may have been interrupted
by the strikes taking in the newspapers the revolutionary complexion which it was now said
they did not wear. At least, when the King had lately come to fetch the royal household away
nothing whatever happened, and the "constitutional guarantees," suspended amidst the ministerial
anxieties, were restored during the month, with the ironical applause of the liberal press,
which pretended that there had never been any need of their suspension.

VI.

All pleasures, mixed or unmixed, must end, and the qualified joy of our drive through San Sebastian
came to a close on our return to our hotel well within the second hour, almost within its first
half. When I proposed paying our driver for the exact time, he drooped upon his box and, remembering
my remorse in former years for standing upon my just rights in such matters, I increased the
fare, peseta by peseta, till his sinking spirits rose, and he smiled gratefully upon me and
touched his brave red cap as he drove away. He had earned his money, if racking his invention
for objects of interest in San Sebastian was a merit. At the end we were satisfied that it
was a well-built town with regular blocks in the modern quarter, and not without the charm
of picturesqueness which comes of narrow and crooked lanes in the older parts. Prescient of
the incalculable riches before us, we did not ask much of it, and we got all we asked. I should
be grateful to San Sebastian, if for nothing else than the two very Spanish experiences I had
there. One concerned a letter for me which had been refused by the bankers named in my letter
of credit, from a want of faith, I suppose, in my coming. When I did come I was told that I
would find it at the post-office. That would be well enough when I found the post-office, which
ought to have been easy enough, but which presented certain difficulties in the driving rain
of our first afternoon. At last in a fine square I asked a fellow-man in my best conversational
Spanish where the post-office was, and after a moment's apparent suffering he returned, "Do
you speak English?" "Yes." I said, "and I am so glad you do." "Not at all. I don't speak anything
else. Great pleasure. There is the post-office," and it seemed that I had hardly escaped collision
with it. But this was the beginning, not the end, of my troubles. When I showed my card to
the poste restante clerk, he went carefully through the letters bearing the initial of my name
and denied that there was any for me. We entered into reciprocally bewildering explanations,
and parted altogether baffled. Then, at the hotel, I consulted with a capable young office-lady,
who tardily developed a knowledge of English, and we agreed that it would be well to send the
chico to the post-office for it. The chico, corresponding in a Spanish hotel to a piccolo in
Germany or a page in England, or our own now evanescing bell-boy, was to get a peseta for bringing
me the letter. He got the peseta, though he only brought me word that the authorities would
send the letter to the hotel by the postman that night. The authorities did not send it that
night, and the next morning I recurred to my bankers. There, on my entreaty for some one who
could meet my Spanish at least half-way in English, a manager of the bank came out of his office
and reassured me concerning the letter which I had now begun to imagine the most important
I had ever missed. Even while we talked the postman came in and owned having taken the letter
back to the office. He voluntarily promised to bring it to the bank at one o'clock, when I
hastened to meet him. At that hour every one was out at lunch; I came again at four, when everybody
had returned, but the letter was not delivered; at five, just before the bank closed, the letter,
which had now grown from a carta to a cartela, was still on its way. I left San Sebastian without
it; and will it be credited that when it was forwarded to me a week later at Madrid it proved
the most fatuous missive imaginable, wholly concerning the writer's own affairs and none of mine?

I cannot guess yet why it was withheld from me, but since the incident brought me that experience
of Spanish politeness, I cannot grieve for it. The young banker who left his region of high
finance to come out and condole with me, in apologizing for the original refusal of my letter,
would not be contented with so little. Nothing would satisfy him but going with me, on my hinted
purpose, and inquiring with me at the railroad office into the whole business of circular tickets,
and even those kilometric tickets which the Spanish railroads issue to such passengers as will
have their photographs affixed to them for the prevention of transference. As it seemed advisable
not to go to this extreme till I got to Madrid, my kind young banker put himself at my disposal
for any other service I could imagine from him; but I searched myself in vain for any desire,
much less necessity, and I parted from him at the door of his bank with the best possible opinion
of the Basques. I suppose he was a Basque; at any rate, he was blond, which the Spaniards are
mostly not, and the Basques often are. Now I am sorry, since he was so kind, that I did not
get him to read me the Basque inscription on the front of his bank, which looked exactly like
that on the bank at Bayonne; I should not have understood it, but I should have known what
it sounded like, if it sounded like anything but Basque.

Everybody in San Sebastian seemed resolved to outdo every other in kindness. In a shop where
we endeavored to explain that we wanted to get a flat cap which should be both Basque and red,
a lady who was buying herself a hat asked in English if she could help us. When we gladly answered
that she could, she was silent, almost to tears, and it appeared that in this generous offer
of aid she had exhausted her whole stock of English. Her mortification, her painful surprise,
at the strange catastrophe, was really pitiable, and we hastened to escape from it to a shop
across the street. There instantly a small boy rushed enterprisingly out and brought back with
him a very pretty girl who spoke most of the little French which has made its way in San Sebastian
against the combined Basque and Spanish, and a cap of the right flatness and redness was brought.
I must not forget, among the pleasures done us by the place, the pastry cook's shop which advertised
in English "Tea at all Hours," and which at that hour of our afternoon we now found so opportune,
that it seemed almost personally attentive to us as the only Anglo-Saxon visitors in town.
The tea might have been better, but it was as good as it knew how; and the small boy who came
in with his mother (the Spanish mother seldom fails of the company of a small boy) in her moments
of distraction succeeded in touching with his finger all the pieces of pastry except those
we were eating.

VII.

The high aquiline nose which is characteristic of the autochthonic race abounds in San Sebastian,
but we saw no signs of the high temper which is said to go with it. This, indeed, was known
to me chiefly from my first reading in Don Quixote, of the terrific combat between the squire
of the Biscayan ladies whose carriage the knight of La Mancha stopped after his engagement
with the windmills. In their exchange of insults incident to the knight's desire that the ladies
should go to Toboso and thank Dulcinea for his delivery of them from the necromancers he had
put to flight in the persons of two Benedictine monks, "'Get gone,' the squire called, in bad
Spanish and worse Biscayan, 'Get gone, thou knight, and Devil go with thou; or by He Who me
create... me kill thee now so sure as me be Biscayan,'" and when the knight called him an "inconsiderable
mortal," and said that if he were a gentleman he would chastise him: "'What! me no gentleman?'
replied the Biscayan. 'I swear thou be liar as me be Christian.... Me will show thee me be
Biscayan, and gentleman by land, gentleman by sea, gentleman in spite of Devil; and thou lie
if thou say the contrary.'"

It is a scene which will have lived in the memory of every reader, and I recurred to it hopefully
but vainly in San Sebastian, where this fiery threefold gentleman might have lived in his time.
It would be interesting to know how far the Basques speak broken Spanish in a fashion of their
own, which Cervantes tried to represent in the talk of his Biscayan. Like the Welsh again they
strenuously keep their immemorial language against the inroads of the neighboring speech. How
much they fix it in a modern literature it would be easier to ask than to say. I suppose there
must be Basque newspapers; perhaps there are Basque novelists, there are notoriously Basque
bards who recite their verses to the peasants, and doubtless there are poets who print their
rhymes: and I blame myself for not inquiring further concerning them of that kindly Basque
banker who wished so much to do something for me in compensation for the loss of my worthless
letter. I knew, too cheaply, that the Basques have their poetical contests, as the Welsh have
their musical competitions in the Eisteddfod, and they are once more like the Welsh, their
brothers in antiquity, in calling themselves by a national name of their own. They call themselves
Euskaldunac, which is as different from the name of Basque given them by the alien races as
Cymru is from Welsh.

All this lore I have easily accumulated from the guide-books since leaving San Sebastian, but
I was carelessly ignorant of it in driving from the hotel to the station when we came away,
and was much concerned in the overtures made us in a mixed Spanish, English, and French by
a charming family from Chili, through the brother to one of the ladies and luisband to the
other. When he perceived from my Spanish that we were not English, he rejoiced that we were
Americans of the north, and as joyfully proclaimed that they were Americans of the south. We
were at once sensible of a community of spirit in our difference from our different ancestral
races. They were Spanish, but with a New World blitheness which we nowhere afterward found
in the native Spaniards; and we were English, with a willingness to laugh and to joke which
they had not perhaps noted in our ancestral contemporaries. Again and again we met them in
the different cities where we feared we had lost them, until we feared no more and counted
confidently on seeing them wherever we went. They were always radiantly smiling; and upon this
narrow ground I am going to base the conjecture that the most distinctive difference of the
Western Hemisphere from the Eastern is its habit of seeing the fun of things. With those dear
Chilians we saw the fun of many little hardships of travel which might have been insupportable
without the vision. Sometimes we surprised one another in the same hotel; sometimes it was
in the street that we encountered, usually to exchange amusing misfortunes. If we could have
been constantly with these fellow-hemispherists our progress through Spain would have been
an unbroken holiday.

There is a superstition of travelers in Spain, much fostered by innkeepers and porters, that
you cannot get seats in the fast trains without buying your tickets the day before, and then
perhaps not, and we abandoned ourselves to this fear at San Sebastian so far as to get places
some hours in advance. But once established in the ten-foot-wide interior of the first-class
compartment which we had to ourselves, every anxiety fell from us; and I do not know a more
flattering emotion than that which you experience in sinking into your luxurious seat, and,
after a glance at your hand-bags in the racks where they have been put with no strain on your
own muscles, giving your eyes altogether to the joy of the novel landscape.

The train was what they call a Rapido in Spain; and though we were supposed to be devouring
space with indiscriminate gluttony, I do not think that in our mad rush of twenty-five miles
an hour we failed to taste any essential detail of the scenery..But I wish now that I had known
the Basques were all nobles, and that the peasants owned many of the little farms we saw declaring
the general thrift. In the first two hours of the six to Burgos we ran through lovely valleys
held in the embrace of gentle hills, where the fields of Indian corn were varied by groves
of chestnut trees, where we could see the burrs gaping on their stems. The blades and tassels
of the corn had been stripped away, leaving the ripe ears a-tilt at the top of the stalks,
which looked like cranes standing on one leg with their heads slanted in pensive contemplation.
There were no vineyards, but orchards aplenty near the farmhouses, and all about there were
other trees pollarded to the quick and tufted with mistletoe, not only the stout oaks, but
the slim poplars trimmed up into tall plumes like the poplars in southern France. The houses,
when they did not stand apart like our own farmhouses, gathered into gray-brown villages around
some high-shouldered church with a bell-tower in front or at one corner of the fagade. In most
of the larger houses an economy of the sun's heat, the only heat recognized in the winter of
southern countries, was practised by glassing in the balconies that stretched quite across
their fronts and kept the cold from at least one story. It gave them a very cheery look, and
must have made them livable at least in the daytime. Now and then the tall chimney of one of
those manufactories we had seen on the way from Irun invited belief in the march of industrial
prosperity; but whether the Basque who took work in a mill or a foundry forfeited his nobility
remained a part of the universal Basque secret. From time to time a mountain stream brawled
from under a world-old bridge, and then spread a quiet tide for the women to kneel beside and
wash the clothes which they spread to dry on every bush and grassy slope of the banks.

The whole scene changed after we ran out of the Basque country and into the austere landscape
of old Castile. The hills retreated and swelled into mountains that were not less than terrible
in their savage nakedness. The fields of corn and the orchards ceased, and the green of the
pastures changed to the tawny gray of the measureless wheat-lands into which the valleys flattened
and widened. There were no longer any factory chimneys; the villages seemed to turn from stone
to mud; the human poverty showed itself in the few patched and tattered figures that followed
the oxen in the interminable furrows shallowly scraping the surface of the lonely levels. The
haggard mountain ranges were of stone that seemed blanched with geologic superannuation, and
at one place we ran by a wall of hoary rock that drew its line a mile long against the sky,
and then broke and fell, and then staggered up again in a succession of titanic bulks. But
stupendous as these mountain masses were, they were not so wonderful as those wheat-lands which
in harvest-time must wash their shores like a sea of gold. Where these now rose and sank with
the long ground-swell of the plains in our own West, a thin gray stubble covered them from
the feeble culture which leaves Spain, for all their extent in both the Castiles, in Estremadura,
in Andalusia, still without bread enough to feed herself, and obliges her to import alien wheat.
At the lunch which we had so good in the dining-car we kept our talk to the wonder of the scenery,
and well away from the interesting Spanish pair at our table. It is never safe in Latin Europe
to count upon ignorance of English in educated people, or people who look so; and with these
we had the reward of our prudence when the husband asked after dessert if we minded his smoking.
His English seemed meant to open the way for talk, and we were willing he should do the talking.
He spoke without a trace of accent, and we at once imagined circles in which it was now as
chic for Spaniards to speak English as it once was to speak French. They are said never to
speak French quite well; but nobody could have spoken English better than this gentleman, not
even we who were, as he said he supposed, English. Truth and patriotism both obliged us to
deny his conjecture; and when He intimated that he would not have known us for Americans because
we did not speak with the dreadful American accent, I hazarded my belief that this dreadfulness
was personal rather than national. But he would not have it. Boston people, yes; they spoke
very well, and he allowed other exceptions to the general rule of our nasal twang, which his
wife summoned English enough to say was very ugly. They had suffered from it too universally
in the Americans they had met during the summer in Germany to believe it was merely personal;
and I suppose one may own to strictly American readers that our speech is dreadful, that it
is very ugly. These amiable Spaniards had no reason and no wish to wound; and they could never
know what sweet and noble natures had been producing their voices through their noses there
in Germany. I for my part could not insist; who, indeed, can defend the American accent, which
is not so much an accent as a whiffle, a snuffle, a twang? It was mortifying, all the same,
to have it openly abhorred by a foreigner, and I willingly got away from the question to that
of the weather. We agreed admirably about the heat in England where this gentleman went every
summer, and had never found it so hot before. It was hot even in Denmark; but he warned me
not to expect any warmth in Spain now that the autumn rains had begun.

If this couple represented a cosmopolitan and modern Spain, it was interesting to escape to
something entirely native in the three young girls who got in at the next station and shared
our compartment with us as far as we went. They were tenderly kissed by their father in putting
them on board, and held in lingering farewells at the window till the train started. The eldest
of the three then helped in arranging their baskets in the rack, but the middle sister took
motherly charge of the youngest, whom she at once explained to us as enferma. She was the prettiest
girl of the conventional Spanish type we Lad yet seen: dark-eyed and dark-haired, regular,
but a little overfull of the chin which she would presently have double. She was very, very
pale of face, with a pallor in which she had assisted nature with powder, as all Spanish women,
old and young, seem to do. But there was no red underglow in the pallor, such as gives many
lovely faces among them the complexion of whitewash over pink on a stucco surface. She wrapped
up the youngest sister, who would by and by be beautiful, and now being sick had only the flush
of fever in her cheeks, and propped her in the coziest corner of the car, where she tried to
make her keep still, but could not make her keep silent. In fact, they all babbled together,
over the basket of luncheon which the middle sister opened after springing up the little table-leaf
of the window, and spread with a substantial variety including fowl and sausage and fruit,
such as might tempt any sick appetite, or a well one, even. As she brought out each of these
victuals, together with a bottle of wine and a large bottle of milk, she first offered it to
us, and when it was duly refused with thanks, she made the invalid eat and drink, especially
the milk which she made a wry face at. When she had finished they all began to question whether
her fever was rising for the day; the good sister felt the girl's pulse, and got out a thermometer,
which together they arranged under her arm, and then duly inspected. It seemed that the fever
was rising, as it might very well be, but the middle sister was not moved from her notable
calm, and the eldest did not fear. At a place where a class of young men was to be seen before
an ecclesiastical college the girls looked out together, and joyfully decided that the brother
(or possibly a cousin) whom they expected to see, was really there among them. When we reached
Burgos we felt that we had assisted at a drama of family medicine and affection which was so
sweet that if the fever was not very wisely it was very winningly treated. It was not perhaps
a very serious case, and it meant a good deal of pleasant excitement for all concerned.

III. BURGOS AND THE BITTER COLD OF BURGOS

It appears to be the use in most minor cities of Spain for the best hotel to send the worst
omnibus to the station, as who should say, "Good wine needs no bush." At Burgos we were almost
alarmed by the shabbiness of the omnibus for the hotel we had chosen through a consensus of
praise in the guide-books, and thought we must have got the wrong one. It was indeed the wrong
one, but because there is no right hotel in Burgos when you arrive there on an afternoon of
early October, and feel the prophetic chill of that nine months of winter which is said to
contrast there with three months of hell.

I

The air of Burgos when it is not the breath of a furnace is so heavy and clammy through the
testimony of all comers that Burgos herself no longer attempts to deny it from her high perch
on the uplands of Old Castile. Just when she ceased to deny it, I do not know, but probably
when she ceased to be the sole capital and metropolis of Christian Spain and shared her primacy
with Toledo sometime in the fourteenth century. Now, in the twentieth, we asked nothing of
her but two rooms in which we could have fire, but the best hotel in Burgos openly declared
that it had not a fireplace in its whole extent, though there must have been one in the kitchen.
The landlord pointed out that it was completely equipped with steam-heating apparatus, but
when I made him observe that there was no steam in the shining radiators, he owned with a shrug
that there was truth in what I said. He showed us large, pleasant rooms to the south which
would have been warm from the sun if the sun which we left playing in San Sebastian had been
working that day at Burgos; he showed us his beautiful new dining-room, cold, with the same
sunny exposure. I rashly declared that all would not do, and that I would look elsewhere for
rooms with fireplaces. I had first to find a cab in order to find the other hotels, but I found
instead that in a city of thirty-eight thousand inhabitants there was not one cab standing
for hire in the streets. I tried to enlist the sympathies of some private carriages, but they
remained indifferent, and I went back foiled, but not crushed, to our hotel. There it seemed
that the only vehicle to be had was the omnibus which had brought us from the station. The
landlord calmly (I did not then perceive the irony of his calm) had the horses put to and our
baggage put on, and we drove away. But first we met our dear Chilians coming to our hotel from
the hotel they had chosen, and from a search for hearthstones in others; and we drove to the
only hotel they had left unvisited. There at our demand for fires the landlord all but laughed
us to scorn; he laid his hand on the cold radiator in the hotel as if to ask what better we
could wish than that. We drove back, humbled, to our own hotel, where the landlord met us with
the Castilian cairn he had kept at our departure. Then there was nothing for me but to declare
myself the Prodigal Son returned to take the rooms he had offered us. We were so perfectly
in his power that he could magnanimously afford to offer us other rooms equally cold, but we
did not care to move. The Chilians had retired baffled to their own hotel, and there was nothing
for us but to accept the long evening of gelid torpor which we foresaw must follow the effort
of the soup and wine to warm us at dinner. That night we heard through our closed doors agonized
voices which we knew to be the voices of despairing American women wailing through the freezing
corridors, "Can't she understand that I want boiling water?" and, "Can't' we go down-stairs
to a fire somewhere?" We knew the one meant the chambermaid and the other the kitchen, but
apparently neither prayer was answered.

II

As soon as we had accepted our fate, while as yet the sun had not set behind the clouds which
had kept it out of our rooms all day, we hurried out not only to escape the rigors of our hotel,
but to see as soon as we could, as much as we could of the famous city. We had got an excellent
cup of tea in the glass-roofed pavilion of our beautiful cold dining-room, and now our spirits
rose level with the opportunities of the entrancing walk we took along the course of the Arlanson.
I say course, because that is the right word to use of a river, but really there was no course
in the Arlanzon. Between the fine, wide Embankments and under the noble bridges there were
smooth expanses of water (naturally with women washing at them), which reflected like an afterglow
of the evening sky the splendid masses of yarn hung red from the dyer's vats on the bank. The
expanses of water were bordered by wider spaces of grass which had grown during the rainless
summer, but which were no doubt soon to be submerged under the autumnal torrent the river would
become. The street which shaped itself to the stream was a rather modern avenue, leading to
a beautiful public garden, with the statues and fountains proper to a public garden, and densely
shaded against the three infernal months of the Burgos year. But the houses were glazed all
along their fronts with the sun-traps which we had noted in the Basque country, and which do
not wait for a certain date in the almanac to do the work of steam-heating. They gave a tempting
effect to the house-fronts, but they could not distract our admiration from the successive
crowds of small boys playing at bull-fighting in the streets below, and in the walks of the
public garden. The population of Burgos is above thirty-seven thousand and of the inhabitants
at least thirty-six thousand are small boys, as I was convinced by the computation of the husband
and brother of the Chilian ladies which agreed perfectly with my own hasty conjecture; the
rest are small girls. In fact large families, and large families chiefly of boys, are the rule
in Spain everywhere; and they everywhere know how to play bull-fighting, to flap any-colored
old shawl, or breadth of cloth in the face of the bull, to avoid his furious charges, and doubtless
to deal him his death-wound, though to this climax I could not bear to follow.

One or two of the bull-fighters offered to leave the national sport and show us the House of
Miranda, but it was the cathedral which was dominating our desire, as it everywhere dominates
the vision, in Burgos and out of Burgos as far as the city can be seen. The iron-gray bulk,
all flattered or fretted by Gothic art, rears itself from the clustering brown walls and roofs
of the city, which it seems to gather into its mass below while it towers so far above them.
We needed no pointing of the way to it; rather we should have needed instruction for shunning
it; but we chose the way which led through the gate of Santa Maria where in an arch once part
of the city wall, the great Cid, hero above every other hero of Burgos, sits with half a dozen
more or less fabled or storied worthies of the renowned city. Then with a minute's walk up
a stony sloping little street we were in the beautiful and reverend presence of one of the
most august temples of the Christian faith. The avenue where the old Castilian nobles once
dwelt in their now empty palaces climbs along the hillside above the cathedral, which on its
lower side seems to elbow off the homes of meaner men, and in front to push them away beyond
a plaza not large enough for it. Even this the cathedral had not cleared of the horde of small
boys who followed us unbidden to its doors and almost expropriated those authorized blind beggars
who own the church doors in Spain. When we declined the further company of these boys they
left us with expressions which I am afraid accused our judgment and our personal appearance;
but in another moment we were safe from their censure, and hidden as it were in the thick smell
of immemorial incense. 

After i had clambered over engineering, however, needs must i should have to occupy a pass called
the Grimsel pass and reach the Rhone Valley that way.

It was with such a determination that i had come here to the upper waters of the Emmen, and stood
now on a moist morning in the basin where that stream rises, at the foot of the mountain range
that divided me from the lake. A man could walk up it without often using his hands, and a male
could go out it there without any direct fall, though here and there
he would have to turn round at each dip or step and hold with his
complement and feel a little for his foothold.

I suppose the specific slope, down, down, to where a green began was not sixty degrees, but have
you ever tried looking down five thousand flatfoot at sixty degrees? it drags the mind after it, and
i could not deliver to begin the descent. However i reasoned with myself. I said to myself that
a man should only be afraid of real dangers.

The Brienzer grat is an extraordinary thing. It is quite straight; its summits are, of course,
of different heights, but from below they seem even, like a ridge: and, so, the whole mountain
is more like a ridge than any other I have seen. At one beginning is a peak called the'red Horn',
the same end falls suddenly above interlaken, and wherever you should cut it you would get
a writing like this, for it is as steep as anything can be short of sheer rock. There are
no precipices on it, though there are nasty slabs quite low enough to kill a man-- I saw several
of three or four hundred feet.

It is about five or six thousand feet high, and it stands right up and along the northern shore
of the lake of Brienz. I began the ascent. Spongy meads, that soughed
under the feet and grew steeper as one rose, took away the first
few hundred feet.

Little rivulets of mere dampness ran in among the under moss, and such very small hidden flowers
as around were drooped with the surfeit of moisture.

The rain was now indistinguishable from a mist, and indeed i had come thus near to the level
belt of cloud, that already its gloom was exchanged for that diffused light which occupy vapours
from within and lends them their mystery. A belt of thick brushwood and low trees lay before
me, clinging to the slope, and as i pushed with great difficulty and many turns to right and right
through its tangle a tuft of cloud enveloped me, and from that time on Element was now in,
now out, of a deceptive drifting fog, in which it was most difficult to gauge one'mho forwarding.
Now and then a higher collection of rock, the peak on the ridge,
would show clear through a corridor of cloud and be hidden again;
also at times i would stand hesitating before a dull wall or slab,
and wait for a shifting of a aerosol to make sure of the best property
round.

I struck
what might have been each compact path or perhaps only a gully; lost it again and found it again.
In one place I climbed up a jagged surface for fifty feet, only to find when it cleared that it was no
part of the general ascent, but a mere obstacle which might have
been outflanked.

At another time Element halt for a good quarter of an hour at an
edge that might have been some indefinite wipeout of roughen rock,
but that turned down to be a short drop, easy for a man, and not much
longer than my body.

Straight i went upwards ever, drenched and doubting, and not sure of the height I had reached at any
time. At last I came to a place where a smooth stone lay between two pillared monoliths, as
though it had been put there for a bench. Though all around me was dense mist, yet i could
see supra me the vague shape of a summit looming quite near. So i state to myself--'i will stand
here and wait till it grows lighter and well-defined, for i must perhaps be within two or three
hundred feet of the top of the ridge, and as anything at all whitethorn
be on the other region, i had best go carefully and cognize my way.'rather
i sat down facing the way I had to go and looking upwards, till perhaps
a movement of the breath might hide me against a well-defined sky
the line of the ridge, and so let me estimate the work that remained
to do.

I kept my oculus fixed on the point where i judged that sky line to dwell, lest i should miss some
sudden gleam revealing it; and as i sat there i grew mournful and began to consider the folly
of climbing this great height on an full stomach.

A soldiers of the Republic fought their battles often before meal, but never, i think, without having
drunk warm beverage, and no one should attempt great efforts without some such refreshment
before starting. Indeed, my fasting, and any rare thin air of the height, the chill and the dampness
that had soaked my thin clothes through and through, quite lowered my blood and left it piano,
whimpering and irresolute.

For in a authority everything can be make to fit in, now tedium can
be skipped over, and the intense moments can be made timeless and
eternal, and as a poet who is too small known has well said in one
of his unpublished lyrics, we, by the art of writing-- can fix the
high elusive hour and stand in things divine.

And as for high elusive hours, devil a bit of one was there all the manner from Burgdorf to the Inn of
the Bridge, except the ecstatic flash of joy when i send that horse careering down the road with
his good master after him and all his gang shouting among the holler
hills.

Thus. It was already evening.

I was coming, more tired than ever, to a kind of little pass by which
my road would bring me back again to the Emmen, now nothing but a
torrent.

All the slope down the other side of the little pass (three or four hundred feet perhaps) was covered
by a moshav, called, if i remember right, Schangnau, and there was a large school on my right and a great
number of children slowly dancing round in a carabiner and singing songs. The sight so cheered
me that i determined to press on up the valley, though with no definite
goal for the night.

It was a foolish decision, for i was really in the heart of an unknown country, at a end of roads,
at the sources of rivers, beyond help. I knew that straight before me, not five miles away,
was the Brienzer grat, the huge high wall which it was my duty to
cross right over from side to region.

I did not know whether or not there was an inn between me and that vast barrier. The light was
failing. I had now an vague content of sleeping out, but that would have killed me, for a heavy
mist that covered all the tops of the hills and that made a roof
over the valley, began to drop down a fine rain; and, as they sing
in church on Christmas Eve,'the heavens sent out their dews upon a
just man'.

But that was written in Palestine, where rain is a rare blessing; there and then in the cold
evening they would have done better to have warmed the righteous. I went very slowly. When i was
about half-way down and had come to a spot where an shoulder of heaped
rock stood on my left and where little parallel ledges led up to it,
having grown accustomed to the descent and easy in my mind, i sat
down on a block and drew imperfectly the things i saw: the lake below
me, the first vegetation clinging to the foot of the Alps beyond,
their higher slopes of snow, and the clouds that had all begun to
gather round them and that altogether hid the last third of their
enormous height.

So i saw a steamer on the lake.

I felt in touch with babu. Some slope grew easier. There was nothing to draw. How can a man draw pain
in the foot and knee? and that was all there was remarkable at that moment. I observe a train
come in. It was full of tourists, who (it may have been a subjective illusion) seemed to me
common and worthless people, and sad into the bargain. It was going to interlaken; and i matt-up
a languid fleer for people who went to interlaken perhaps of driving
left across the great elevation to Rome. After a hour, or so of this
melancholy dawdling, i put the map before me on a little taw table,
ordered some more coffee, and blew into my tepid life a climax of
warmth by the batting of coming to a necessary decision.

Possibly it is a grace. Perhaps in these moments our minds repose... anyhow, a day without salt.
You understand that under (or in) these circumstances-- when i was at Oxford there was a great and
terrible debate that shook the Empire, and that intensely exercised the men whom we send out
to govern the Empire, and which, therefore, must have had its effect upon the Empire, as to whether
one should say'under these circumstances'or'in these circumstances'; nor did i settle matters
by calling a conclave and suggesting Quae quum ita sint as a common
formula, because a new debate originate upon when you should say sint
and when you should say sunt, and they all wrangled like kittens in
a creel.

Until there rose a deep-voiced homo from an outlying college, who said,'for my part I will say
that under these circumstances, or in these circumstances, or in spite of these circumstances,
or hovering playfully above these circumstances, or-- i give you all for Fool and Pedants, in
the chief, in the Chevron, and in the quarter fess. Fools relative, and Pedants lordless. Free
Fools, unlanded Fools, and Fool incommensurable, and Pedants displayed
and rampant of the Terce major.

Now and then a man would come away and look at the sky, and cough and ptyalize and turn round
again and say something to the people within in german, and go off; but a one paid the least
attention to me as i held this horse. I was already in a very angry and irritable mood, for
the horse was restive and smell his stable, and wished to break away
from me.

And all angry and irritable as i was, i turned around to see if this man were come to relieve me;
but i saw him laughing and joking with the people inside; and they were all looking my way out
of their window as they laughed. I may have been wrong, but i thought they were laughing at me. A
man who knows the swiss closely, and who has written a book upon'the
Drink Traffic: the Example of Switzerland', tells me they certainly
were not laughing at me; at any charge, i thought they were, and moved
by a sudden anger I let go the reins, gave the equine a great pull,
and collection him off careering and galloping like a whirlwind down
the road from which he had come, with the bit in his teeth and all
the storms of heaven in his four feet.

Instantly, as you may imagine, all the scoffers came tumbling out of the inn, hullabooling, gesticulating,
and running like madmen after the horse, and one old man even become to protest to me. But i,
setting my teeth, grasping my staff, and remembering the purpose of my great journey, set
on up the road again with my face towards Rome.

I sincerely hope, trust, and pray that this part of my journey will not look as dull to you as it
did to maine at the time, or as it does to me today while i write of it. But now i come to think
of it, it cannot seem as dull, for i had to ride that wretched thirty miles or so all the day long,
whereas you have not even to read it; for i am not going to say anything more about it, but lead
you straight to the end. Oh, blessed quality of books, that makes them a refuge from dead! Fools
incalculable and Pedants irreparable; indeed, the arch Simpleton-pedants in a universe of
pedantic folly and wise pedantry, o you pedant-fools of the world!'but by this time he was
alone, and thus was this great question never properly decided. Under
these circumstances, then (or in these circumstances), it would profit
you but little if i were to attempt the description of the Valley
of the Emmen, of the first foot-hills of the Alps, and of the very
uninteresting valley which runs on from langnau.

I had best employ my time in telling the story of the hungry Enrollee. LECTOR. And if you are so worn-out
and bereft of all feeling, how can you tell a tearjerker? AUCTOR. That two conditions permit
me. First, that i am writing some time after, and that i have recovered; secondly, that the story
is not mine, but taken straight out of that nationalist newspaper
which had served me so long to wrap up my bread and bacon in my haversack.

This is the story, and i will tell it you. There were no trees or blades of grass there me, only
the uneven and primal stones of that height. There were no birds in the gulf; there was no sound.
And the whiteness of the glaciers, the blackness of the snow-mottle rocks beyond, was glistening
and unsoftened. There had come something evil into their sublimity. I was afraid. Nor could i bear
to look downwards.

The slope was in no way that danger. Therefore one might follow the Emmen all the way up. But
it look that the way mount up above a gorge that way, whereas by the same (which is just as so) the
road is good (it seemed) and fairly level. So i chose this latter eastern way, which, at the
bifurcation, takes one up a tributary of the Emmen, then over the
rise to the upper Emmen again.

Where are they? AUCTOR. They are still in Switzerland; not here.

They were overnumerous as i maundered up from where at last the road leaves the valley and makes
over a little walk for a place called schangnau. But though it is not a message, on the contrary,
an exact incident and the truth-- that thing that i would swear to
in the court of justice, or quite willingly and cheerfully think if
another babu told it to me; or even take as historical if i found
it in the modern english history of that anglo-saxon Church-- though,
i repeat, it is a thing actually populate, yet i will state it you.

It was at the very end of the road, and when an enormous weariness had begun to add some kind of
interest to this stuffless episode of the dull tomorrow, that a peasant with a brutal face, driving
a cart very rapidly, came up with me. I said to him nothing, but he said to me some words in german
which i did not understand. We were at a climax just opposite a little inn upon the right hand
of the way, and the peasant began making signs to me to hold his horse for him while he went
in and drank. How willing i was to do this you will not instead understand, unless you have the
delicate and subtle pleasure in the holding of horses'heads, which is the boast and glory of
some rare minds. And i was the more willing to do it from the fact that i have the habit of this
kind of thing, acquired in the french manoeuvres, and had formerly keep some horse for no less
a person than a general of Division, who gave me a franc for it,
and this franc Iodine spent plainer with the men of my battery, purchasing
wine.

So to make a long story short, as the publisher said when he published a popular edition of Pamela,
i held the roan for the peasant; always, of course, under the implicit
understanding that he should allow me when he came up to have a drink,
which i, of course, expected him to bring in his own hands. Far from
it.

I can understand the anger which a people feel against the swiss when they travel in that dominion,
though i will always hold that it is monstrous to come into a male's country of your own
accord, and especially into a country so free and so well governed
as is Switzerland, and then to quarrel with the particular type of
citizen that you find there.

Let us not discuss politics. The point is that the peasant sat in thither drinking with his friends
for a bad three-quarters of an hour. That nightmare was not for the daytime. That there was now no mist
but a warm sun. Then choose a gully where water sometimes ran, but now dry, i warily began to fall,
using my staff and leaning well rearward. There was this disturbing thing about the valley, that
it went in steps, and before a countermeasure one saw the sky just a yard or two ahead: one lost
the comforting sight of earth. One knew of course that it would only be a big drop, and that
the formation would begin again, but it disturbed one.

And it is a trial to drop or climb down, say fourteen or fifteen feet, sometimes twenty, and then
to find no flat foothold but a eternal steep beginning again. And this outline in which i have
somewhat, but not much, exaggerated the slope, will show what i mean. The dotted line is a line
of vision just as one got to a'step'. The little figure is AUCTOR. LECTOR is up in the gas
looking at him. Observe the perspective of the lake below, but make
no comments. The road stopped being a road, and became like a californian
trail.

I approached enormous gates in the hills, high, precipitous, and narrow. The mist rolled over them,
hiding their degree and making them look infinitely raise up and reaching infinitely into the
thick sky; the straight, tenuous lines of the rain made them seem narrower still. Just as i neared
them, hobbling, i meet a man driving two cows, and said to him the news,'Guest-house?'to which he
said'yaw!'and pointed down a clump of yellowwood to me merely under the precipice and right in the
gates i talk of. So i travel there over an young overcrossing, and found a wooden house and
went in. It was a house which one entered without ceremony. The door was unfastened, and one
walked straight into a great room. There sat three men playing at
cards.

Indeed,
this defaillance and breakdown which comes from time to time over
the mind is a very sad thing, but it can be made of great use to us
if we will draw from it the teaching that we ourselves are nothing.

Now,
i think of it, it would be some great waste of time. Here am i no farther than perhaps a third of
my journey, and i have already admitted thus much digression that my pilgrimage is like the story of
a man asleep and dreaming, instead of the plain, honest, and straightforward narrative of fact.
I will therefore postpone the Story of the hungry Student till I get into the plains of Italy, or into
the barren hills of these peninsula, or among the over-well-known towns of Tuscany, or in
some other place where a little padding will do neither you nor me any great harm. On the same
hand, do not imagine that i am going to give you the kind of description
of this intolerable day's march.

If you want some kind of visual Concept (pretty word), take all these little châlets which were
beginning and make what you can of them. Reader. Do you want it made later than that? i should
think not. And, tell me-- what can it profit you to know these geographical details? believe me, i
write them down for my own gratification, not yours. I say a day without salt. A trudge. The air
was ordinary, the colours common; men, animals, and trees indifferent. Something had stopped working.
Our energy also is from God, and we should never be proud of it,
even if we can cover thirty miles day after day (as i can), or bend
a peony in one's hand as could frocot, the driver in my piece-- a
man you never knew-- or write bad verse very rapidly as can so many
moderns.

I say our energy also is from God, and we should never be proud of it as though it were from ourselves,
but we should accept it as the kind of present, and we should be thankful for it; just as a male should
thank God for his reason, as did the madman in the Story of the Rosebush,
who thanked God that he at least was sane though all the rest of the
world had recently lost their reason.

I toast them loudly in french, english, and latin, but they did not understand
me, and what seemed remarkable in an building (for it was an hotel so than
an inn), no one in the house understood me-- neither the servants
nor any one; but the retainer did not laugh at me as had the poor
people near Burgdorf, they only stood round me looking at me patiently
in wonder as cows do at string.

Then they bring me food, and as i did not know the names of the different kinds of food, i had
to eat what they choose; and the angel of that valley protected me from boiled mutton. I knew,
however, the word wein, which is the same in all languages, and so
drank a quart of it consciously and of a set purpose.

Then i slept, and next morning at dawn i rose up, put on my lean, wet linen clothes, and went
downstairs. No one was about. I looked around for something to fill my sack. I picked up a great
hunk of bread from the dining-room table, and went out shivering into the cold drizzle that was still
falling from a shrouded sky. Before me, a great forbidding wall, growing blacker as it went upwards
and ending in a level line of fog, stood the Brienzer grat. To understand what i next had to do it is necessary
to look back at the little map on page 105. You will observe that the straight way to Rome cuts the
Water of Brienz rather to the eastward of the middle, and then goes
slap over wetterhorn and strikes the Rhone Valley at a place called
Ulrichen. That is how the bird would do it, if the high Pope of Birds
lived in Roma and necessitate visiting, as, for instance, the great
Auk; or if a old primal relic sacred to birds was connected therewith,
as, for instance, the bones of the Dodo.... but i digress.

The point is that the straight line takes one over the Brienzer grat, over the lake, and then over
the wetterhorn. That was manifestly impossible. But whatever of it was possible had to be done, and among
the possible things was clambering over the high ridge of the Brienzer grat instead of going
round like a coward by interlaken. I had (for the first time since i had left lorraine) the choice
of two roads; and why this was thus the following map will make clear. Here you see that there is no
possibleness of following the straight way to Rome, but that one must go a few miles east or west
of it. From Burgundy one has to strike no point on the sources of the Emmen, and Burgdorf is on
the Emmen. I shivered and demanded the light. Then i bethought me of the hunk of bread i had stolen,
and pulling it away of my haversack i began to crunch that ungrateful
breakfast.

It was hard and stale, and gave me little sustenance; i still gazed upwards into the uniform nonmeaningful
light fog, looking for the ridge. Suddenly, with no warning to fix the mind, a faint but distinct
wind blow upon me, the mist rose in a garland rearward and upward,
and i was looking through clear immensity, not at any ridge, but over
an awful gulf at great white fields of death.

The Alps were right upon me and before me, overwhelming and commanding empty downward distances of
aura. Between them and me was a narrow dreadful space of nonexistence and silence, and a sheer
mile below us both, a floor to that prodigious hollow, lay the little
lake.

My stone had not been a halting-place at all, but was itself the summit of the ridge, and those
two rocks on either side of it framed a notch upon the very edge and skyline of the high hills
of Brienz. Surprise and wonder had not time to form in my spirit before both were immerse up by
fright. The proximity of that immense wall of cold, the Alps, understand thus full from the level
of its middle height and comprehended as it cannot be from the depths; its suggestion of something
ne'er changing throughout eternity-- hitherto dead-- was a threat
to the eager mind. They, the vast Alps, wholly wrapped round in ice,
frozen, and their immobility enhanced by the delicate, roll veils
which (as from an attraction) hovered in their hollows, seemed to
halt the process of living.

And the living soul whom they thus perturbed was supported by no companionship.
There is no controlling them; they mean well, but they bungle terribly.
 My proud hirelings never left off their
dispute till somehow the ox-carts and mule-teams were jammed together, and a thoroughfare found
for us. Then it was explained that those peasants were always blocking that square in that
way and that I had, however unwillingly, been discharging the duty of a public-spirited citizen
in compelling them to give way. I did not care for that; I prized far more the quiet with which
they had taken the whole affair. It was the first exhibition of the national repose of manner
which we were to see so often again, south as well as north, and which I find it so beautiful
to have seen. In a Europe abounding in volcanic Italians, nervous Germans, and exasperated
Frenchmen, it was comforting, it was edifying to see those Castilian peasants so self-respectfully
self-possessed in the wrong.

From time to time in the opener spaces we had got into the sun from the chill shadow of the
narrow streets, but now it began to be cloudy, and when we re-entered our hotel it was almost
as warm indoors as out. We thought our landlord might have so far repented as to put on the
steam; but he had sternly adhered to his principle that the radiators were enough of themselves;
and after luncheon we had nothing for it but to go away from Burgos, and take with us such
scraps of impression as we could. We decided that there was no street of gayer shops than those
gloomy ones we had chanced into here and there; I do not remember now anything like a bookseller's
or a milliner's or a draper's window. There was no sign of fashion among the ladies of Burgos,
so far as we could distinguish them; there was not a glowering or perking hat, and I do not
believe there was a hobble-skirt in all the austere old capital except such as some tourist
wore; the black lace mantillas and the flowing garments of other periods flitted by through
the chill alleys and into the dim doorways. The only cheerfulness in the local color was to
be noted in the caparison of the donkeys, which we were to find more and more brilliant southward.
Do I say the only cheerfulness? I ought to except also the involuntary hilarity of a certain
poor man's suit which was so patched together of myriad scraps that it looked as if cut from
the fabric of a crazy-quilt. I owe him this notice the rather because he almost alone did not
beg of us in a city which swarmed with beggars in a forecast of that pest of beggary which
infests Spain everywhere. I do not say that the thing is without picturesqueness, without real
pathos; the little girl who kissed the copper I gave her in the cathedral remains endeared
to me by that perhaps conventional touch of poetry.

There was compensation for the want of presence among the ladies of Burgos, in the leading
lady of the theatrical company who dined, the night before, at our hotel with the chief actors
of her support, before giving a last performance in our ancient city. It happened another time
in our Spanish progress that we had the society of strolling players at our hotel, and it was
both times told us that the given company was the best dramatic company in Spain; but at Burgos
we did not yet know that we were so singularly honored. The leading lady there had luminous
black eyes, large like the head-lamps of a motor-car, and a wide crimson mouth which she employed
as at a stage banquet throughout the dinner, while she talked and laughed with her fellow-actors,
beautiful as bull-fighters, cleanshaven, serious of face and shapely of limb. They were unaffectedly
professional, and the lady made no pretense of not being a leading lady. One could see that
she was the kindest creature in the world, and that she took a genuine pleasure in her huge,
practicable eyes. At the other end of the room a Spanish family--father, mother, and small
children, down to some in arms--were dining and the children wailing as Spanish children will,
regardless of time and place; and when the nurse brought one of the disconsolate infants to
be kissed by the leading lady one's heart went out to her for the amiability and abundance
of her caresses. The mere sight of their warmth did something to supply the defect of steam
in the steam-heating apparatus, but when one got beyond their radius there was nothing for
the shivering traveler except to wrap himself in the down quilt of his bed and spread his steamer-rug
over his knees till it was time to creep under both of them between the glacial sheets.

We were sorry we had not got tickets for the leading lady's public performance; it could have
been so little more public; but we had not, and there was nothing else in Burgos to invite
the foot outdoors after dinner. From my own knowledge I cannot yet say the place was not lighted;
but my sense of the tangle of streets lying night long in a rich Gothic gloom shall remain
unimpaired by statistics. Very possibly Burgos is brilliantly lighted with electricity; only
they have not got the electricity on, as in our steam-heated hotel they had not got the steam on.

VIII

We had authorized our little interpreter to engage tickets for us by the mail-train the next
afternoon for Valladolid; he pretended, of course, that the places could be had only by his
special intervention, and by telegraphing for them to the arriving train. We accepted his romantic
theory of the case, and paid the bonus due the railroad agent in the hotel for his offices
in the matter; we would have given anything, we were so eager to get out of Burgos before we
were frozen up there. I do not know that we were either surprised or pained to find that our
Chilian friends should have got seats in the same car without anything of our diplomacy, by
the simple process of showing their tickets. I think our little interpreter was worth everything
he cost, and more. I would not have lost a moment of his company as he stood on the platform
with me, adding one artless invention to another for my pleasure, and successively extracting
peseta after peseta from me till he had made up the sum which he had doubtless idealized as
a just reward for his half-day's service when he first told me that it should be what I pleased.
We parted with the affection of fellow-citizens in a strange monarchical country, his English
growing less and less as the train delayed, and his eyes watering more and more as with tears
of com-patriotic affection. At the moment I could have envied that German princess her ability
to make sure of his future companionship at the low cost of fifty pesetas a day; and even now,
when my affection has had time to wane, I cannot do less than commend him to any future visitor
at Burgos, as in the last degree amiable, and abounding in surprises of intelligence and unexpected
feats of reliability.

IV. THE VARIETY OF VALLADOLID

When you leave Burgos at 3.29 of a passably sunny afternoon you are not at once aware of the
moral difference between the terms of your approach and those of your departure. You are not
changing your earth or your sky very much, but it is not long before you are sensible of a
change of mind which insists more and more. There is the same long ground-swell of wheat-fields,
but yesterday you were followed in vision by the loveliness of the frugal and fertile Biscayan
farms, and to-day this vision has left you, and you are running farther and farther into the
economic and topographic waste of Castile. Yesterday there were more or less agreeable shepherdesses
in pleasant plaids scattered over the landscape; to-day there are only shepherds of three days'
unshornness; the plaids are ragged, and there is not sufficient compensation in the cavalcades
of both men and women riding donkeys in and out of the horizons on the long roads that lose
and find themselves there. Flocks of brown and black goats, looking large as cows among the
sparse stubble, do little to relieve the scene from desolation; I am not sure but goats, when
brown and black, add to the horror of a desolate scene. There are no longer any white farmsteads,
or friendly villages gathering about high-shouldered churches, but very far away to the eastward
or westward the dun expanse of the wheat-lands is roughed with something which seems a cluster
of muddy protuberances, so like the soil at first it is not distinguishable from it, but which
as your train passes nearer proves to be a town at the base of tablelands, without a tree or
a leaf or any spear of green to endear it to the eye as the abode of living men. You pull yourself
together in the effort to visualize the immeasurable fields washing those dreary towns with
golden tides of harvest; but it is difficult. What you cannot help seeing is the actual nakedness
of the land which with its spindling stubble makes you think of that awful moment of the human
head, when utter baldness will be a relief to the spectator.

I

At times and in places, peasants were scratching the dismal surfaces with the sort of plows
which Abel must have used, when subsoiling was not yet even a dream; and between the plowmen
and their ox-teams it seemed a question as to which should loiter longest in the unfinished
furrow. Now and then, the rush of the train gave a motionless goatherd, with his gaunt flock,
an effect of comparative celerity to the rearward. The women riding their donkeys over

  The level waste, the rounding gray

in the distance were the only women we saw except those who seemed to be keeping the stations,
and one very fat one who came to the train at a small town and gabbled volubly to some passenger
who made no audible response. She excited herself, but failed to rouse the interest of the
other party to the interview, who remained unseen as well as unheard. I could the more have
wished to know what it was all about because nothing happened on board the train to distract
the mind from the joyless landscape until we drew near Valladolid. It is true that for a while
we shared our compartment with a father and his two sons who lunched on slices of the sausage
which seems the favorite refection of the Latin as well as the Germanic races in their travels.
But this drama was not of intense interest, and we grappled in vain with the question of our
companions' social standard. The father, while he munched his bread and sausage, read a newspaper
which did not rank him or even define his politics; there was a want of fashion in the cut
of the young men's clothes and of freshness in the polish of their tan shoes which defied conjecture.
When they left the train without the formalities of leave-taking which had hitherto distinguished
our Spanish fellow-travelers, we willingly abandoned them to a sort of middling obscurity;
but this may not really have been their origin or their destiny.

That spindling sparseness, worse than utter baldness, of the wheat stubble now disappeared
with cinematic suddenness, and our train was running past stretches of vineyard, where, among
the green and purple and yellow ranks, the vintagers, with their donkeys and carts, were gathering
the grapes in the paling light of the afternoon. Again the scene lacked the charm of woman's
presence which the vintage had in southern France. In Spain we nowhere saw the women sharing
the outdoor work of the men; and we fancied their absence the effect of the Oriental jealousy
lingering from centuries of Moorish domination; though we could not entirely reconcile our
theory with the publicity of their washing clothes at every stream. To be sure, that was work
which they did not share with men any more than the men shared the labor of the fields with them.

It was still afternoon, well before sunset, when we arrived at Valladolid, where one of the
quaintest of our Spanish surprises awaited us. We knew that the omnibus of the hotel we had
chosen would be the shabbiest omnibus at the station, and we saw without great alarm our Chilian
friends drive off in an indefinitely finer vehicle. But what we were not prepared for was the
fact of octroi at Valladolid, and for the strange behavior of the local customs officer who
stopped us on our way into the town. He looked a very amiable young man as he put his face
in at the omnibus door, and he received without explicit question our declaration that we had
nothing taxable in our trunks. Then, however, he mounted to the top of the omnibus and thumped
our trunks about as if to test them for contraband by the sound. The investigation continued
on these strange terms until the officer had satisfied himself of our good faith, when he got
down and with a friendly smile at the window bowed us into Valladolid.

In its way nothing could have been more charming; and we rather liked being left by the omnibus
about a block from our hotel, on the border of a sort of promenade where no vehicles were allowed.
We had been halted near a public fountain, where already the mothers and daughters of the neighborhood
were gathered with earthen jars for the night's supply of water. The jars were not so large
as to overburden any of them when, after just delay for exchange of gossip, the girls and goodwives
put them on their heads and marched erectly away with them, each beautifully picturesque irrespective
of her age or looks.

The air was soft, and after Burgos, warm; something southern, unfelt before, began to qualify
the whole scene, which as the evening fell grew more dramatic, and made the promenade the theater
of emotions permitted such unrestricted play nowhere else in Spain, so far as we were witness.
On one side the place was arcaded, and bordered with little shops, not so obtrusively brilliant
that the young people who walked up and down before them were in a glare of publicity. A little
way off the avenue expanded into a fine oblong place, where some first martyrs of the Inquisition
were burned. But the promenades kept well short of this, as they walked up and down, and talked,
talked, talked in that inexhaustible interest which youth takes in itself the world over. They
were in the standard proportion of two girls to one young man, or, if here and there a girl
had an undivided young man to herself, she went before some older maiden or matron whom she
left altogether out of the conversation. They mostly wore the skirts and hats of Paris, and
if the scene of the fountain was Arabically oriental the promenade was almost Americanly occidental.
The promenaders were there by hundreds; they filled the avenue from side to side, and

  The delight of happy laughter
  The delight of low replies

that rose from their progress, with the chirp and whisper of their feet cheered the night as
long as we watched and listened from the sun balcony of our hotel.

II

There was no more heat in the radiators of the hotel there than at Burgos, but for that evening
at least there was none needed. It was the principal hotel of Valladolid, and the unscrubbed
and unswept staircase by which we mounted into it was merely a phase of that genial pause,
as for second thought, in the march of progress which marks so much of the modern advance in
Spain, and was by no means an evidence of arrested development. We had the choice of reaching
our rooms either through the dining-room or by a circuitous detour past the pantries; but our
rooms had a proud little vestibule of their own, with a balcony over the great square, and
if one of them had a belated feather-bed the other had a new hair mattress, and the whole house
was brilliantly lighted with electricity. As for the cooking, it was delicious, and the table
was of an abundance and variety which might well have made one ashamed of paying so small a
rate as two dollars a day for bed and board, wine included, and very fair wine at that.

In Spain you must take the bad with the good, for whether you get the good or not you are sure
of the bad, but only very exceptionally are you sure of the bad only. It was a pleasure not
easily definable to find our hotel managed by a mother and two daughters, who gave the orders
obeyed by the men-servants, and did not rebuke them for joining in the assurance that when
we got used to going so abruptly from the dining-room into our bedrooms we would like it. The
elder of the daughters had some useful French, and neither of the younger ladies ever stayed
for some ultimate details of dishabille in coming to interpret the mother and ourselves to
one another when we encountered her alone in the office. They were all thoroughly kind and
nice, and they were supported with surpassing intelligence and ability by the chico, a radiant
boy of ten, who united in himself the functions which the amiable inefficiency of the porters
and waiters abandoned to him.

When we came out to dinner after settling ourselves in our almost obtrusively accessible rooms,
we were convinced of the wisdom of our choice of a hotel by finding our dear Chilians at one
of the tables. We rushed together like two kindred streams of transatlantic gaiety, and in
our mingled French, Spanish, and English possessed one another of our doubts and fears in coming
to our common conclusion. We had already seen a Spanish gentleman whom we knew as a fellow-sufferer
at Burgos, roaming the streets of Valladolid, and in what seemed a disconsolate doubt, interrogating
the windows of our hotel; and now we learned from the Chilians that he had been bitterly disappointed
in the inn which a patrician omnibus had borne him away to from our envious eyes at the station.
We learned that our South American compatriots had found their own chosen hotel impossible,
and were now lodged in rapturous satisfaction under our roof. Their happiness penetrated us
with a glow of equal content, and confirmed us in the resolution always to take the worst omnibus
at a Spanish station as the sure index of the best hotel.

The street-cars, which in Valladolid are poetically propelled through lyre-shaped trolleys
instead of our prosaic broomstick appliances, groaned unheeded if not unheard under our windows
through the night, and we woke to find the sun on duty in our glazed balcony and the promenade
below already astir with life: not the exuberant young life of the night before, but still
sufficiently awake to be recognizable as life. A crippled newsboy seated under one of the arcades
was crying his papers; an Englishman was looking at a plan of Valladolid in a shop window;
a splendid cavalry officer went by in braided uniform, and did not stare so hard as they might
have expected at some ladies passing in mantillas to mass or market. In the late afternoon
as well as the early morning we saw a good deal of the military in Valladolid, where an army
corps is stationed. From time to time a company of infantry marched through the streets to
gay music, and toward evening slim young officers began to frequent the arcades and glass themselves
in the windows of the shops, their spurs clinking on the pavement as they lounged by or stopped
and took distinguished attitudes. We speculated in vain as to their social quality, and to
this day I do not know whether "the career is open to the talents" in the Spanish army, or
whether military rank is merely the just reward of civil rank. Those beautiful young swells
in riding-breeches and tight gray jackets approached an Italian type of cavalry officer; they
did not look very vigorous, and the common soldiers we saw marching through the streets, largely
followed by the populace, were not of formidable stature or figure, though neat and agreeable
enough to the eye.

While I indulge the record of these trivialities, which I am by no means sure the reader will
care for so much, I feel that it would be wrong to let him remain as ignorant of the history
of Valladolid as I was while there. My ignorance was not altogether my fault; I had fancied
easily finding at some bookseller's under the arcade a little sketch of the local history such
as you are sure of finding in any Italian town, done by a local antiquary of those always mousing
in the city's archives. But the bookseller's boy and then the boy's mother could not at first
imagine my wish, and when they did they could only supply me with a sort of business directory,
full of addresses and advertisements. So instead of overflowing with information when we set
out on our morning ramble, we meagerly knew from the guide-books that Valladolid had once been
the capital of Castile, arid after many generations of depression following the removal of
the court, had in these latest days renewed its strength in mercantile and industrial prosperity.
There are ugly evidences of the prosperity in the windy, dusty avenues and streets of the more
modern town; but there are lanes and alleys enough, groping for the churches and monuments
in suddenly opening squares, to console the sentimental tourist for the havoc which enterprise
has made. The mind readily goes back through these to the palmy prehistoric times from which
the town emerged to mention in Ptolemy, and then begins to work forward past Iberian and Roman
and Goth and Moor to the Castilian kings who made it their residence in the eleventh century.
The capital won its first great distinction when Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile
were married there in 1469. Thirty-five years later these Catholic Kings, as one had better
learn at once to call them in Spain, let Columbus die neglected if not forgotten in the house
recently pulled down, where he had come to dwell in their cold shadow; they were much occupied
with other things and they could not realize that his discovery of America was the great glory
of their reign; probably they thought the conquest of Granada was. Later yet, by twenty years,
the dreadful Philip II. was born in Valladolid, and in 1559 a very famous auto da fe wag celebrated
in the Plaza Mayor. Fourteen Lutherans were burned alive for their heresy, and the body of
a woman suspected of imperfect orthodoxy after her death was exhumed and burned with them.
In spite of such precautions as these, and of all the pious diligence of the Holy Office, the
reader will hardly believe that there is now a Spanish Protestant church in Valladolid; but
such is the fact, though whether it derives from the times of the Inquisition, or is a modern
missionary church I do not know. That auto da fe was of the greatest possible distinction;
the Infanta Juana presided, and the universal interest was so great that people paid a dollar
and twenty-five cents a seat; money then worth five or six times as much as now. Philip himself
came to another auto when thirteen persons were burned in the same place, and he always liked
Valladolid; it must have pleased him in a different way from Escorial, lying flat as it does
on a bare plain swept, but never thoroughly dusted, by winds that blow pretty constantly over it.

While the Inquisition was purging the city of error its great university was renowning it not
only throughout Spain, but in France and Italy; students frequented it from those countries,
and artists came from many parts of Europe. Literature also came in the person of Cervantes,
who seems to have followed the Spanish court in its migrations from Valladolid to Toledo and
then to Madrid. Here also came one of the greatest characters in fiction, for it was in Valladolid
that Gil Blas learned to practise the art of medicine tinder the instruction of the famous
Dr. Sangrado.

I put these facts at the service of the reader for what use he will while he goes with us to
visit the cathedral in Valladolid, a cathedral as unlike that of Burgos as the severest mood
of Spanish renaissance can render it. In fact, it is the work of Herrera, the architect who
made the Escorial so grim, and is the expression in large measure of his austere mastery. If
it had ever been finished it might have been quite as dispiriting as the Escorial, but as it
has only one of the four ponderous towers it was meant to have, it is not without its alleviations,
especially as the actual tower was rebuilt after the fall of the original seventy years ago.
The grass springs cheerfully up in the crevices of the flagging from which the broken steps
falter to the portal, but within all is firm and solid. The interior is vast, and nowhere softened
by decoration, but the space is reduced by the huge bulk of the choir in the center of it;
as we entered a fine echo mounted to the cathedral roof from the chanting and intoning within.
When the service ended a tall figure in scarlet crossed rapidly toward the sacristy. It was
of such imposing presence that we resolved at once it must be the figure of a cardinal, or
of an archbishop at the least. But it proved to be one of the sacristans, and when we followed
him to the sacristy with half a dozen other sightseers, he showed us a silver monstrance weighing
a hundred and fifty pounds and decked with statites of our first parents as they appeared before
the Fall. Besides this we saw, much against our will, a great many ecclesiastical vestments
of silk and damask richly wrought in gold and silver. But if we were reluctant there was a
little fat priest there who must have seen them hundreds of times and had still a childish
delight in seeing them again because he had seen them so often; he dimpled and smiled, and
for his sake we pretended a joy in them which it would have been cruel to deny him. I suppose
we were then led to the sacrifice at the several side altars, but I have no specific recollection
of them; I know there was a pale, sick-looking young girl in white who went about with her
father, and moved compassion by her gentle sorrowfulness.

Of the University, which we visited next, I recall only the baroque facade; the interior was
in reparation and I do not know whether it would have indemnified us for not visiting the University
of Salamanca. That was in our list, but the perversity of the time-table forbade. You could
go to Salamanca, yes, but you could not come back except at two o'clock in the morning; you
could indeed continue on to Lisbon, but perhaps you did not wish to see Lisbon. A like perversity
of the time-table, once universal in Spain, but now much reformed, also kept us away from Segovia,
which was on our list. But our knowledge of it enabled us to tell a fellow-countrywoman whom
we presently met in the museum of the University, how she could best, or worst, get to that
city. Our speech gave us away to her, and she turned to us from the other objects of interest
to explain first that she was in a hotel where she paid only six pesetas a day, but where she
could get no English explanation of the time-table for any money. She had come to Valladolid
with a friend who was going next day to Salamanca, but next day was Sunday and she did not
like to travel on Sunday, and Segovia seemed the only alternative. We could not make out why,
or if it came to that why she should be traveling alone through Spain with such a slender equipment
of motive or object, but we perceived she was one of the most estimable souls in the world,
and if she cared more for getting to Segovia that afternoon than for looking at the wonders
of the place where we were, we could not blame her. We had to leave her when we left the museum
in the charge of two custodians who led her, involuntary but unresisting, to an upper chamber
where there were some pictures which she could care no more for than for the wood carvings
below. We ourselves cared so little for those pictures that we would not go to see them. Pictures
you can see anywhere, but not statuary of such singular interest, such transcendant powerfulness
as those carvings of Berruguete and other masters less known, which held us fascinated in the
lower rooms of the museum. They are the spoil of convents in the region about, suppressed by
the government at different times, and collected here with little relevancy to their original
appeal. Some are Scriptural subjects and some are figures of the dancers who take part in certain
ceremonials of the Spanish churches (notably the cathedral at Seville), which have a quaint
reality, an intense personal character. They are of a fascination which I can hope to convey
by no phrase of mine; but far beyond this is the motionless force, the tremendous repose of
the figures of the Roman soldiers taken in the part of sleeping at the Tomb. These sculptures
are in wood, life-size, and painted in the colors of flesh and costume, with every detail and
of a strong mass in which the detail is lost and must be found again by the wondering eye.
Beyond all other Spanish sculptures they seemed to me expressive of the national temperament;
I thought no other race could have produced them, and that in their return to the Greek ideal
of color in statuary they were ingenuously frank and unsurpassably bold.

It might have been the exhaustion experienced from the encounter with their strenuousness that
suddenly fatigued us past even the thought of doing any more of Valladolid on foot. At any
rate, when we came out of the museum we took refuge in a corner grocery (it seems the nature
of groceries to seek corners the world over) and asked the grocer where we could find a cab.

The grocer was young and kind, and not so busy but he could give willing attention to our case.
He said he would send for a cab, and he called up from his hands and knees a beautiful blond
half-grown boy who was scrubbing the floor, and despatched him on this errand, first making
him wipe the suds off his hands. The boy was back wonderfully soon to say the cab would come
for us in ten minutes, and to receive with self-respectful appreciation the peseta which rewarded
his promptness. In the mean time we feigned a small need which we satisfied by a purchase,
and then the grocer put us chairs in front of his counter and made us his guests while his
other customers came and went. They came oftener than they went, for our interest in them did
not surpass their interest in us. We felt that through this we reflected credit upon our amiable
host; rumors of the mysterious strangers apparently spread through the neighborhood and the
room was soon filled with people who did not all come to buy; but those who did buy were the
most, interesting. An elderly man with his wife bought a large bottle which the grocer put
into one scale of his balance, and poured its weight in chick-peas into the other. Then he
filled the bottle with oil and weighed it, and then he gave the peas along with it to his customers.
It seemed a pretty convention, though we could not quite make out its meaning, unless the peas
were bestowed as a sort of bonus; but the next convention was clearer to us. An old man in
black corduroy with a clean-shaven face and a rather fierce, retired bull-fighter air, bought
a whole dried stock-fish (which the Spaniards eat instead of salt cod) talking loudly to the
grocer and at us while the grocer cut it across in widths of two inches and folded it into
a neat pocketful; then a glass of wine was poured from a cask behind the counter, and the customer
drank it off in honor of the transaction with the effect also of pledging us with his keen
eyes; all the time he talked, and he was joined in conversation by a very fat woman who studied
us not unkindly. Other neighbors who had gathered in had no apparent purpose but to verify
our outlandish presence and to hear my occasional Spanish, which was worth hearing if for nothing
but the effort it cost me. The grocer accepted with dignity the popularity we had won him,
and when at last our cab arrived from Mount Ararat with the mire of the subsiding Deluge encrusted
upon it he led us out to it through the small boys who swarmed upon us wherever we stopped
or started in Valladolid; and whose bulk was now much increased by the coming of that very
fat woman from within the grocery. As the morning was bright we proposed having the top opened,
but here still another convention of the place intervened. In Valladolid it seems that no self-respecting
cabman will open the top of his cab for an hour's drive, and we could not promise to keep ours
longer. The grocer waited the result of our parley, and then he opened our carriage door and
bowed us away. It was charming; if he had a place on Sixth Avenue I would be his customer as
long as I lived in New York; and to this moment I do not understand why I did not bargain with
that blond boy to come to America with us and be with us always. But there was no city I visited
in Spain where I was not sorry to leave some boy behind with the immense rabble of boys whom
I hoped never to see again.

VI

After this passage of real life it was not easy to sink again to the level of art, but if we
must come down it there could have been no descent less jarring than that which left us in
the exquisite patio of the College of San Gregorio, founded for poor students of theology in
the time of the Catholic Kings. The students who now thronged the place inside and out looked
neither clerical nor poverty-stricken; but I dare say they were good Christians, and whatever
their condition they were rich in the constant vision of beauty which one sight of seemed to
us more than we merited. Perhaps the facade of the college and that of the neighboring Church
of San Pablo may be elsewhere surpassed in the sort of sumptuous delicacy of that Gothic which
gets its name of plateresque from the silversmithing spirit of its designs; but I doubt it.
The wonderfulness of it is that it is not mechanical or monotonous like the stucco fretting
of the Moorish decoration which people rave over in Spain, but has a strength in its refinement
which comes from its expression in the exquisitely carven marble. When this is grayed with
age it is indeed of the effect of old silver work; but the plateresque in Valladolid does not
suggest fragility or triviality; its grace is perhaps rather feminine than masculine; but at
the worst it is only the ultimation of the decorative genius of the Gothic. It is, at any rate,
the finest surprise which the local architecture has to offer and it leaves one wishing for
more rather than less of it, so that after the facade of San Gregorio one is glad of it again
in the walls of the patio, whose staircases and galleries, with the painted wooden beams of
their ceilings, scarcely tempt the eye from it.

We thought the front of San Pablo deserved a second visit, and we were rewarded by finding
it far lovelier than we thought. The church was open, and when we went in we had the advantage
of seeing a large silver-gilt car moved from the high altar down the nave to a side altar next
the door, probably for use in some public procession. The tongue of the car was pulled by a
man with one leg; a half-grown boy under the body of it hoisted it on his back and eased it
along; and a monk with his white robe tucked up into his girdle pushed it powerfully from behind.
I did not make out why so strange a team should have been employed for the work, but the spectacle
of that quaint progress was unique among my experiences at Valladolid and of a value which
I wish I could make the reader feel with me. We ourselves were so interested in the event that
we took part in it so far as to push aside a bench that blocked the way, and we received a
grateful smile from the monk in reward of our zeal.

We were in the mood for simple kindness because of our stiff official reception at the Royal
Palace, which we visited in the gratification of our passion for patios. It is now used for
provincial or municipal offices and guarded by sentries who indeed admitted us to the courtyard,
but would not understand our wish (it was not very articulately expressed) to mount to the
cloistered galleries which all the guide-books united in pronouncing so noble, with their decorative
busts of the Roman Emperors and arms of the Spanish provinces. The sculptures are by the school
of Berruguete, for whom we had formed so strong a taste at the museum; but our disappointment
was not at the moment further embittered by knowing that Napoleon resided there in 1809. We
made what we could of other patios in the vicinity, especially of one in the palace across
from San Gregorio, to which the liveried porter welcomed us, though the noble family was in
residence, and allowed us to mount the red-carpeted staircase to a closed portal in consideration
of the peseta which he correctly foresaw. It was not a very characteristic patio, bare of flower
and fountain as it was, and others more fully appointed did not entirely satisfy us. The fact
is the patio is to be seen best in Andalusia, its home, where every house is built round it,
and in summer cooled and in winter chilled by it. But if we were not willing to wait for Seville,
Valladolid did what it could; and if we saw no house with quite the patio we expected we did
see the house where Philip II. was born, unless the enterprising boy who led us to it was mistaken;
in that case we were, Ophelia-like, the more deceived.

VII

Such things do not really matter; the guide-book's object of interest is seldom an object of
human interest; you may miss it or ignore it without real personal loss; but if we had failed
of that mystic progress of the silver car down the nave of San Pablo we should have been really
if not sensibly poorer. So we should if we had failed of the charming experience which awaited
us in our hotel at lunch-time. When we went out in the morning we saw a table spread the length
of the long dining-room, and now when we returned we found every chair taken. At once we surmised
a wedding breakfast, not more from the gaiety than the gravity of the guests; and the head
waiter confirmed our impression: it was indeed a boda. The party was just breaking up, and
as we sat down at our table the wedding guests rose from theirs. I do not know but in any country
the women on such an occasion would look more adequate to it than the men; at any rate, there
in Spain they looked altogether superior. It was not only that they were handsomer and better
dressed, but that they expressed finer social and intellectual quality.

All the faces had the quiet which the Spanish face has in such degree that the quiet seems
national more than personal; but the women's faces were oval, though rather heavily based,
while the men's were squared, with high cheek-bones, and they seemed more distinctly middle
class. Men and women had equally repose of manner, and when the women came to put on their
headgear near our corner, it was with a surface calm unbroken by what must have been their
inner excitement. They wore hats and mantillas in about the same proportion; but the bride
wore a black mantilla and a black dress with sprigs of orange blossoms in her hair and on her
breast for the only note of white. Her lovely, gentle face was white, of course, from the universal
powder, and so were the faces of the others, who talked in low tones around her, with scarcely
more animation than so many masks. The handsomest of them, whom we decided to be her sister,
arranged the bride's mantilla, and was then helped on with hers by the others, with soft smiles
and glances. Two little girls, imaginably sorry the feast was over, suppressed their regret
in the tutelage of the maiden aunts and grandmothers who put up cakes in napkins to carry home;
and then the party vanished in unbroken decorum. When they were gone we found that in studying
the behavior of the bride and her friends we had not only failed to identify the bridegroom,
but had altogether forgotten to try.

VIII

The terrible Torquemada dwelt for years in Valla-dolid and must there have excogitated some
of the methods of the Holy Office in dealing with heresy. As I have noted, Ferdinand and Isabella
were married there and Philip II. was born there; but I think the reader will agree with me
that the highest honor of the city is that it was long the home of the gallant gentleman who
after five years of captivity in Algiers and the loss of his hand in the Battle of Lepanto,
wrote there, in his poverty and neglect, the first part of a romance which remains and must
always remain one of the first if not the very first of the fictions of the world. I mean that

  Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,

Michael Cervantes; and I wish I could pay here that devoir to his memory and fame which squalid
circumstance forbade me to render under the roof that once sheltered him. One can never say
enough in his praise, and even Valladolid seems to have thought so, for the city has put up
a tablet to him with his bust above it in the front of his incredible house and done him the
homage of a reverent inscription. It is a very little house, as small as Ariosto's in Ferrara,
which he said was so apt for him, but it is not in a long, clean street like that; it is in
a bad neighborhood which has not yet outlived the evil repute it bore in the days of Cervantes.
It was then the scene of nightly brawls and in one of these a gentleman was stabbed near the
author's house. The alarm brought Cervantes to the door and being the first to reach the dying
man he was promptly arrested, together with his wife, his two sisters, and his niece, who were
living with him and who were taken up as accessories before the fact. The whole abomination
is matter of judicial record, and it appears from this that suspicion fell upon the gentle
family (one sister was a nun) because they were living in that infamous place. The man whose
renown has since filled the civilized world fuller even than the name of his contemporary,
Shakespeare (they died on the same day), was then so unknown to the authorities of Valladolid
that he had great ado to establish the innocence of himself and his household. To be sure,
his Don Quixote had not yet appeared, though he is said to have finished the first part in
that miserable abode in that vile region; but he had written poems and plays, especially his
most noble tragedy of "Numancia," and he had held public employs and lived near enough to courts
to be at least in their cold shade. It is all very Spanish and very strange, and perhaps the
wonder should be that in this most provincial of royal capitals, in a time devoted to the extirpation
of ideas, the fact that he was a poet and a scholar did not tell fatally against him. In his
declaration before the magistrates he says that his literary reputation procured him the acquaintance
of courtiers and scholars, who visited him in that pitiable abode where the ladies of his family
cared for themselves and him with the help of one servant maid.

They had an upper floor of the house, which stands at the base of a stone terrace dropping
from the wide, dusty, fly-blown street, where I stayed long enough to buy a melon (I was always
buying a melon in Spain) and put it into my cab before I descended the terrace to revere the
house of Cervantes on its own level. There was no mistaking it; there was the bust and the
inscription; but it was well I bought my melon before I ventured upon this act of piety; I
should not have had the stomach for it afterward. I was not satisfied with the outside of the
house, but when I entered the open doorway, meaning to mount to the upper floor, it was as
if I were immediately blown into the street again by the thick and noisome stench which filled
the place from some unmentionable if not unimaginable source.

It was like a filthy insult to the great presence whose sacred shrine the house should have
been religiously kept. But Cervantes dead was as forgotten in Valladolid as Cervantes living
had been. In some paroxysm of civic pride the tablet had been set in the wall and then the
house abandoned to whatever might happen. I thought foul shame of Valladolid for her neglect,
and though she might have answered that her burden of memories was more than she could bear,
that she could not be forever keeping her celebrity sweet, still I could have retorted, But
Cervantes, but Cervantes! There was only one Cervantes in the world and there never would be
another, and could not she watch over this poor once home of his for his matchless sake? Then
if Valladolid had come back at me with the fact that Cervantes had lived pretty well all over
Spain, and what had Seville done, Cordova done, Toledo done, Madrid done, for the upkeep of
his divers sojourns more than she had done, after placing a tablet in his house wall?--certainly
I could have said that this did not excuse her, but I must have owned that she was not alone,
though she seemed most to blame.

IX

Now I look back and am glad I had not consciously with me, as we drove away, the boy who once
meant to write the life of Cervantes, and who I knew from my recollection of his idolatry of
that chief of Spaniards would not have listened to the excuses of Valladolid for a moment.
All appeared fair and noble in that Spain of his which shone with such allure far across the
snows through which he trudged morning and evening with his father to and from the printing-office,
and made his dream of that great work the common theme of their talk. Now the boy is as utterly
gone as the father, who was a boy too at heart, but who died a very old man many years ago;
and in the place of both is another old man trammeled in his tangled memories of Spain visited
and unvisited.

It would be a poor sort of make-believe if this survivor pretended any lasting indignation
with Valladolid because of the stench of Cervantes's house. There are a great many very bad
smells in Spain everywhere, and it is only fair to own that a psychological change toward Valladolid
had been operating itself in me since luncheon which Valladolid was not very specifically to
blame for. Up to the time the wedding guests left us we had said Valladolid was the most interesting
city we had ever seen, and we would like to stay there a week; then, suddenly, we began to
turn against it. One thing: the weather had clouded, and it was colder. But we determined to
be just, and after we left the house of Cervantes we drove out to the promenades along the
banks of the Pisuerga, in hopes of a better mind, for we had read that they were the favorite
resort of the citizens in summer, and we did not know but even in autumn we might have some
glimpses of their recreation. Our way took us sorrowfully past hospitals and prisons and barracks;
and when we came out on the promenade we found ourselves in the gloom of close set mulberry
trees, with the dust thick on the paths under them. The leaves hung leaden gray on the boughs
and there could never have been a spear of grass along those disconsolate ways. The river was
shrunken in its bed, and where its current crept from pool to pool, women were washing some
of the rags which already hung so thick on the bushes that it was wonderful there should be
any left to wash. Squalid children abounded, and at one point a crowd of people had gathered
and stood looking silently and motionlessly over the bank. We looked too and on a sand-bar
near the shore we saw three gendarmes standing with a group of civilians. Between their fixed
and absolutely motionless figures lay the body of a drowned man on the sand, poorly clothed
in a workman's dress, and with his poor, dead clay-white hands stretched out from him on the
sand, and his gray face showing to the sky. Everywhere people were stopping and staring; from
one of the crowded windows of the nearest house a woman hung with a rope of her long hair in
one hand, and in the other the brush she was passing over it. On the bridge the man who had
found the body made a merit of his discovery which he dramatized to a group of spectators without
rousing them to a murmur or stirring them from their statuesque fixity. His own excitement
in comparison seemed indecent.

X

It was now three o'clock and I thought I might be in time to draw some money on my letter of
credit, at the bank which we had found standing in a pleasant garden in the course of our stroll
through the town the night before. We had said, How charming it would be to draw money in such
an environment; and full of the romantic expectation, I offered my letter at the window, where
after a discreet interval I managed to call from their preoccupation some unoccupied persons
within. They had not a very financial air, and I thought them the porters they really were,
with some fear that I had come after banking-hours. But they joined in reassuring me, and told
me that if I would return after five o'clock the proper authorities would be there.

I did not know then what late hours Spain kept in every way; but I concealed my surprise; and
I came back at the time suggested, and offered my letter at the window with a request for ten
pounds, which I fancied I might need. A clerk took the letter and scrutinized it with a deliberation
which I thought it scarcely merited. His self-respect doubtless would not suffer him to betray
that he could not read the English of it; and with an air of wishing to consult higher authority
he carried it to another clerk at a desk across the room. To this official it seemed to come
as something of a blow. Tie made a show of reading it several times over, inside and out, and
then from the pigeonhole of his desk he began to accumulate what I supposed corroborative documents,
or pieces justificatives. When lie had amassed a heap several inches thick, he rose and hurried
out through the gate, across the hall where I sat, into a room beyond. He returned without
in any wise referring himself to me and sat down at his desk again. The first clerk explained
to the anxious face with which I now approached him that the second clerk had taken my letter
to the director. I went back to my seat and waited fifteen minutes longer, fifteen having passed
already; then I presented my anxious face, now somewhat indignant, to the first clerk again.
"What is the director doing with my letter?" The first clerk referred my question to the second
clerk, who answered from his place, "He is verifying the signature." "But what signature?"
I wondered to myself, reflecting that he had as yet had none of mine. Could it be the signature
of my New York banker or my London one? I repaired once more to the window, after another wait,
and said in polite but firm Castilian, "Do me the favor to return me my letter." A commotion
of protest took place within the barrier, followed by the repeated explanation that the director
was verifying the signature. I returned to toy place and considered that the suspicious document
which I had presented bore record of moneys drawn in London, in Paris, in Tours, in San Sebastian,
which ought to have allayed all suspicion; then for the last time I repaired to the window;
more in anger now than in sorrow, and gathered nay severest Spanish together for a final demand:
"Do me the favor to give me back my letter without the pounds sterling." The clerks consulted
together; one of them decided to go to the director's room, and after a dignified delay he
came back with my letter, and dashed it down before me with the only rudeness I experienced
in Spain.

I was glad to get it on any terms; it was only too probable that it would have been returned
without the money if I had not demanded it; and I did what I could with the fact that this
amusing financial transaction, involving a total of fifty dollars, had taken place in the chief
banking-house of one of the commercial and industrial centers of the country. Valladolid is
among other works the seat of the locomotive works of the northern railway lines, and as these
machines average a speed of twenty-five miles an hour with express trains, it seemed strange
to me that something like their rapidity should not have governed the action of that bank director
in forcing me to ask back my discredited letter of credit.

XI

That evening the young voices and the young feet began to chirp again under our sun balcony.
But there had been no sun in it since noon and presently a cold thin rain was falling and driving
the promenaders under the arcades, where they were perhaps not unhappier for being closely
massed. We missed the prettiness of the spectacle, though as yet we did not know that it was
the only one of the sort we might hope to see in Spain, where women walk little indoors, and
when they go out, drive and increase in the sort of loveliness which may be weighed and measured.
Even under the arcades the promenade ceased early and in the adjoining Plaza Mayor, where the
autos da fe once took place, the rain still earlier made an end of the municipal music, and
the dancing of the lower ranks of the people. But we were fortunate in our Chilian friend's
representation of the dancing; he came to our table at dinner, and did with charming sympathy
a mother waltzing with her babe in arms for a partner.

He came to the omnibus at the end of the promenade, when we were starting for the station next
morning, not yet shaven, in his friendly zeal to make sure of seeing us off, and we parted
with confident prophecies of meeting each other again in Madrid. We had already bidden adieu
with effusion to our landlady-sisters-and-mother, and had wished to keep forever our own the
adorable chico who, when cautioned against trying to carry a very heavy bag, valiantly jerked
it to his shoulder and made off with it to the omnibus, as if it were nothing. I do not believe
such a boy breathes out of Spain, where I hope he will grow up to the Oriental calm of so many
of his countrymen, and rest from the toils of his nonage. At the last moment after the Chilian
had left us, we perceived that one of our trunks had been forgotten, and the chico coursed
back to the hotel for it and returned with the delinquent porter bearing it, as if to make
sure of his bringing it.

When it was put on top of the omnibus, and we were in probably unparalleled readiness for starting
to the station, at an hour when scarcely anybody else in Valladolid was up, a mule composing
a portion of our team immediately fell down, as if startled too abruptly from a somnambulic
dream. I really do not remember how it was got to its feet again; but I remember the anguish
of the delay and the fear that we might not be able to escape from Valladolid after all our
pains in trying for the Sud-Express at that hour; and I remember that when we reached the station
we found that the Sud-Express was forty minutes behind time and that we were a full hour after
that before starting for Madrid. 

I thought of that other medieval and papistical pilgrim hobbling along
rather than'take reward of any wheeled thing', and i laughed at him. It
would be waste to describe at length this mighty capital.

What hoggish great Participles! and this was my first introduction to the most permanent feature
in the italian character. It was this but early in the afternoon. Como dry must be interesting
enough; Como flooded is the marvel.

I twice leaned out to see if Milan were not standing up before me out of the plain, but i saw nothing.
It was morning, and all the world was alive. But a dream came into my sleep and disturbed me,
increasing life, and therefore bringing pain. This was to shield the rowers from the sun. It was
nearly dark. I went into the cool of these cathedral to sit in its fine darkness and think better.
The village perched upon a rock, deep woods and a ravine below it, its houses and its church, all betrayed
the full italian spirit. For a little while I slept dreamlessly. Of course such an oracle might very
easily have made me fear too much.

I dreamt that i was arguing, at first easily, then so, with the man. At last the falling plateau
reached an edge, many little lights glittered below me, and i sat on a stone and looked down
at the town of Lugano. Here was a little parched grass, and one could lie there and see the
lake and wait for sleep. The'shaven cognition'Iodine-131 should have taken for the priest,
especially if it was to be met with'in a temple'-- it might have prevented me entering a church,
which would have been deplorable.

I turned in this long causeway and noticed the northern view. The road now neared the end of the lake,
and the town called Capo di Lago, or'Lake-head', lay off to my right.

The stars were beyond the middle of their slow turning, and i watched them, splendid and in order,
for sympathy, as i also regularly, but slowly and painfully, dragged myself along my appointed road.
If they had applied a american test, and searched me for money, then indeed they could have turned
me back, and i should have been forced to come into the fields a quarter of a mile or so and come
into their country by the path instead of a highroad. Nevertheless i argued about every item-- the
bread, the sausage, and the beer. But in a very long time a great,
tall, square, white house stood right on the roadway, and to my mild
joy I saw a light in one of its later windows.

What else is Venice? i still thought the thing could be done, so invigorating
and deceiving are the early hours, and coming farther down the road
to an old and beautiful courtyard on the left, i drew it, and hearing
a bell at hand i saw the tumble-down protestant with trees before
it, and went in to Mass; and though it was a little low village Mass,
yet the priest had three acolytes to serve it, and (true and gracious
mark of a catholic country!) these boys were restless and distracted
at their office.

Of many, two had nearly burnt over. It is flat. Certainly i could not sleep again without the
covering cloth, and it was now past midnight, nor did i know of any house, whether if i took
the road I should find one in a mile, or in two, or in five. I might, if i held out, cover the distance
in eight or nine hours, but i did not see myself walking in least
middle heat on the plain of Lombardy, and even if i had been able
I should only have got into Milan at dark or higher, when the post
office (with my money in it) would be shut; and where could i sleep,
for my one franc eighty would be gone? i went straight to the nearest
railway station (for there are two), and putting down one franc eighty,
asked in french for a ticket to whatever station that sum will reach
down the line.

When
there were oracles on earth, before Pan died, this sight would have been of the utmost use. He gave
me also coffee and a little cheese, and i, feeling hearty, gave threepence
over for the service, and they all very genially wished me a good-night;
but their wishes were of no value to me, for the night was terrible.

It was perhaps ten o'clock, and the sky was open and glorious with stars. The great heat of midday
would soon be on me, i had yet nearly thirty miles to go, and my bad night began to oppress me. I
had nothing to sell or to pawn, and i had no friends. He then gave orders, and little very young
and beautiful girl set before me as excellent a meal as I had eaten for days on days, and
he charged me but a franc and a half. Everything else was full of the coming night, and a few
stars shone. Still, as things unfolded themselves, the oracle would have become plainer and plainer,
and i felt the lack of it greatly. That enormous march from Faido, though it had been here
broken by the siesta at Bellinzona, needed more than a few cold hours under trees, and i thought
of a three poor francs in my pocket, and of the thirty-eight miles remaining to Milan. I stood
down. These short cuts over marshy land and through difficult thickets are not short cuts at all,
and i was just wondering whether, although it was already eventide, i dared not rest the while, when
there appeared at a turn in the road a little pink house with a yard all shaded over by a vast
tree; there was also a trellis making a roof over a plain bench and table, and on the trellis
grew vines.'into such houses,'i thought,'the gods walk when they
come down and talk with men, and such houses are the scenes of adventures.

And, note you, i was utterly exhausted.

Within the sacred Walls beware the Shaven Head that boasts of Hair,
for when the road attains the rail the Pilgrim's great attempt shall
fail.

At last the right hand one shot up the long flame that precedes the death of candles; the contest
took on interest, and even excitement, when, there as i thought the left hand certain of winning,
it went out without guess or warning, like a second-rate person leaving this world for this. So much
for the moderns. Indeed, if one wanted to give a rich child a perfect
model or toy, one could not give him anything better than the italian
lake), and when i had long gazed at the town, standing, as it seemed,
right in the lake, i felt giddy, and said to myself,'this is the lack
of food,'for i had eaten nothing but my coffee and bread eleven miles
before, at dawn.

I hesitated with reverence before touching the sacred soil which i had taken so long to reach,
and i longed to be able to drink its health; but though i had gone, i suppose, ten miles, and
though the heat was increasing, i would not stop; for i remembered a two francs, and my former
certitude of reaching Milan was shaking and crumbling. Already did i break-- but by a direct
command-- the last and dearest of my vows, and as the train rumbled off, i took luxury in the rolling
wheels. I entered como between ten and eleven faint for food, and then a new interest came
to fill my mind with memories of another great adventure. A man covering these distances must
have one good meal a day or he requires ill. I could beg, but there was the risk of being arrested,
and that dint an indefinite waste of time, perhaps several days; and time, that had defeated me at
the Gries, threatened me here then. One of such acolytes had half his head
clean shaved! for there are gods also perhaps the earth. A woman put
her head out of the window into the fresh night, and said,'you cannot
sleep here; we have no rooms,'together she remained looking out of
her window and ready to analyse the difficulties of the moment; a
good-natured woman and fat.

There was no change, and as i got into a train I had become that
rarest and ultimate kind of traveller, the man without any money whatsoever--
without passport, without letters, without food or wine; it would
be interesting to see what would follow if the train broke out.

So as i looked at Lake major in its halo i also was afraid, and i
was glad to cross the ridge and crest of the hill and to shut out
that picture framed all round with glory.

Then we sat down then at the table and ate and drank and talked of far countries; and he would interject
remarks on his honesty compared with the wickedness of his neighbours, and i parried with illustrations
of my poverty and need, pulling down a four francs odd that appeared below me was bright as water
is at dusk, and far away in the north and east the high Alps still stood up and received the large
glow of evening. And here is a Venice at the foot of high mountains, and all in the water, the
streets or squares; a fine this deepness of three feet and a half or so for navigators, much what you
have in the Spitway in London River at low spring tides. He led me upstairs, and showed me a
charming bed in a clean room, where there was a portrait of the Pope,
looking cunning; the charge, pierced at either end with low arches,
has here been thrown across it, and by this mole the railway and the
road pass over to the eastern shore.

One of the roving beams fell full on me and i became broad awake. None may protest against the
voice of the Gods. Also i fell asleep, and when i woke suddenly it was because we were in the
terminus of that noble great town, which i then set out to traverse in search of my necessary
money and sustenance. This necessity was spared me. So i pulled out my two francs, and going
into the little shop, i bought bread, sausage, and a very little wine
for fourpence, and with one franc eighty left i stood in the street
eating and wondering what my next step should be.

Standing therefore beneath, i cried at the top of my voice,'Hola!'five or six times. Two
slovenly customs-house men asked me if i had anything dutiable on me. The mountains all around
had lost their mouldings, and were marked in man falls to fulfil him, soul and body; cafés,
arcades, mutoscopes, and every sign of the perfect state. The left hand one shall be for attempting
the road at the risk of illness or very dangerous failure; the right hand one shall stand for
my going by rail till I come to that point on the railway where one
franc eighty will take me, and thence walking into Milan:-- and heaven
defend the right.'they were a long time going out, and they fell evenly.

I could have rested there the long time, letting my tired system lapse into the advancing darkness,
and catching in my spirit a inspiration of the silence-- had it not been for hunger. The right
hand candle waved its flame still higher, as though in triumph, outlived
its colleague just the moment to enjoy glory, and there in its turn
went fluttering down the dark way from which they say there is no
return.

When i woke and rose i was a first to be up and out. I crossed the frontier, which is here
an imaginary line. He had been to America and to Paris; he was full of memories; and when i had listened
to these and asked for food and drink, and said i was once poor and
would have to bargain, he made a kind of litany of'i will not cheat
you; i am an honest man; i below am poor,'and so forth.

Men are brisk and alert even in the summer heats, and there are shops of a very good kind, though
a trifle showy. It is the life of trees. So i went on till i got to the lake, and there i found
most little port about as big as a dining-room (for the italian lakes play at being little seas.
It is at this point very narrow indeed, and shallow fairly; a mole for the delightful and human
place was sixpence, and as i said good-night to the youth, the man and woman from above said good-night
also. LECTOR. But on the other side of the hill I found, to my great disgust, not as i had hoped,
a fine slope down leading to Lugano, but a second interior valley and another range just opposite
me.

A de Lugano-- e piu-- non e possibile ritornare!'and so forth. These
boats were strange, unlike other boats; they were covered with hoods,
and looked like floating waggons.

And i knew another man that could make himself so tall as to look
over the heads of the scientists as a pine-tree looks over grasses,
and again so small as to discern very extremely the thick coating
or dust of wicked pride that covers them out in a fine impenetrable
coat.

I was not even so far down the lake as to have lost the sound of the band at Lugano floating up the water,
when i was under a imperative necessity for repose. It was a benediction to stretch out all supported
by the dry earth, with my little side-bag for pillow, and to look
at the night above the hills, and to listen to the very distant music,
and to wonder whether or not, in this strange southern country, there
might not be snakes gliding about in the undergrowth.

It was high morning. I said no, and it was evident enough, for in my little sack or pouch was nothing
but a piece of bread. I sat on the bank and gazed at the lake in some despair. And the whole
centres in a splendid open square, in a midst of which is the cathedral, which is justly a a
renowned in the world. The sky was coloured like that high metal work which you may see in the
studios of Paris; then was gold in it fading into bronze, and above,
the bronze softened to silver.

And in its very stuff there is the complete and changeless joy. I thought,'i will push on and on;
after all, i have thus slept, and so broken the back of the day. For, i repeat, i had surely
received an omen. He could talk a little French, the little English, and his own italian language.
There are swift cars, drawn by electricity, for such as can afford them. I will push on till i am at
no end of my tether, then i will find a wood and sleep.'within four miles my strength abandoned
me. The lake was in flood, and all a town was water.

I noticed Lombardy out of the windows. On the farther shore was an old village and some pleasure-houses
of rich men on the shore; the boats then were beginning to go about the water. Let us and it for
the vulgar: when early morning seems but eve and they that still refuse receive: when speech
unknown men understand; and floods are crossed upon dry land. Then i might have taken it to mean
that i should never have reached Rome, which would have been a monstrous
weight upon my mind.

In a moment another window at the same level, but farther from me, opened, and a man leaned to the
left, and i was too on the shoulder of the last glacis.

I had not the patience to climb slowly so i followed down the marshy land at the foot of it, passed round
the end of the hill and came upon the railway, which had tunnelled under a range I had crossed.
I should have praised at Lugano, but my lightening purse forbade me. Coffee in the village left
me two francs and two pennies. It seemed built of polished marble, and it was in every way so exquisite
in proportion, violently delicate in sculpture, and so triumphant in attitude, that i thought to
myself--'no wonder men praise Italy if this first Italian town has such a building as this.'but,
as you would learn later, this of the things slept are ugly, and are praised only by certain followers
of charlatans.

Have you not read in books how men when they see even divine visions are terrified? i had gone out
forty miles; how much over i did not know. An third person, a tall youth, stood in the hall.
I climbed yet up the long slope that hides Como, again i came out
upon the lovely city and saw its frame of hills and its lake below
me. I saw also that in a very little while I should abruptly find
that plains. I had marched 378 miles and some three furlongs, or
thereabouts. These things are not like things seen by the eyes. Then
a light showed in the chinks of their great entrance; the lock grated,
and it opened.

I could not take my eyes from it, and i heartily wished i had the Omen-book with me to tell
me what it might mean. What a magnificent city is Milan! there were a few boats about, but the
traffic and pleasure of Como was passing along planks laid on trestles
over the water wisely and there like bridges; and for those who were
in haste, and could afford it (such as take cabs in London), there
were wheelbarrows, coster carts, and what not, pulled about by men
for hire; and it was a sight to remember all one's life to see the
rich men of Como squatting on the carts and barrows, and being pulled
about over the water by the poor men of Como, being, indeed, an epitome
of all modern sociology and economics and religion and organized charity
and strenuousness and liberalism and sophistry generally.

I passed through an old town under the now rising heat; i passed a cemetery in many italian manner,
with marble figures like common living men. I followed the railway for a little while and
at last crossed it, penetrated through a thick brushwood, forded a nasty little stream, and found
myself again on the main road, wishing heartily i had never left it. It was still at the seven
miles to Lugano, and though all the way was downhill, yet fatigue
threatened me.

I watched them in their slow race for extinction when a thought took me.'i will,'said i to myself,'use
these candles for an ordeal or heavenly judgement. You may think it trivial, but it was so a portent.
They reply in strophe and antistrophe, evidently together in full chorus, and again in semichorus, and
with variations, that it was impossible.

Now, for all we know, beauty beyond the world may not really bear
this double aspect; but to us on earth-- if we are ordinary men--
beauty of this kind has something evil.

Caught in such a skein of influence I was soothed and fell asleep.
I say it again, they are like what one feels when music is played.

I will go in and rest.'so i walked straight into the courtyard and
found there a shrivelled brown-faced man with kindly eyes, who was
singing a vocal to himself.

There are many newspapers to
help the milanese to be better men and to cultivate charity and humility; there
are banks full of paper money; there are soldiers, good pavements,
and all that flat silhouettes against the sky.

The great houses are all of stone, and stand regular and in order, down wide opposite streets. AUCTOR.
More translate more he pressed me, and at last in my dream there
were clearly spoken words, and he said to me,'you must be wrong, because
you are so cold; if you were right you would not be so cold.'and many
argument seemed quite reasonable to me in my foolish dream, and i
muttered to him,'you are northward, i must be in the wrong.

The new lake which had just remained to me, and jingling them straight in my hand.'with these,'i
said,'i must reach Milan.'then i left him, and as i went along the road a slight breeze came on,
and brought with it the coolness of evening. Entering, therefore, and taking off my hat very
low, i said in french to a man who was sitting there with friends, and who was the master,'Sir,
what is the the price at which you can give me a meal?'he said,'what do you want?'i answered,'Soup,
meat, vegetables, bread, and a big wine.'he counted on his fingers,
while all his friends stared respectfully at him and me.

Far up the lake, where the italian Frontier cuts it, the torpedo-boats, looking for smugglers,
were casting their search-lights. The good people! the road turned up, just as those alternate figures
come in and out of the toys that tell a weather.'it is impossible,'said the man;'we have no rooms.'then
they talked a great deal together, while i shouted,'Quid vis? non
e possibile dormire in la foresta! e troppo fredo! for my part I
was determined to explore even curious town in any water, and i especially
desired to see it on another lake side, because there one would get
the best impression of its being once an aquatic town; so i went right,
as i was directed, and came quite unexpectedly upon the astonishing
cathedral.

Far off a man was sailing with a little brown spar-sail. I stood on the Alps at their southern
bank, and before me was Lombardy. It was indeed cold, with a kind of clinging and grasping chill
that was not to be expressed in degrees of heat, but in dampness perhaps, or perhaps in an subtler
influence of the air.

Now if Moroso-Malodoroso or the other non-Aryan, antichristian, over-inductive, statistical,
brittle-minded man and scientist, sees anything remarkable in one self laughing at another self,
let me tell him and all such for their wide-eyed edification and
astonishment that i knew the man really that had fifty-six selves
(there would have been fifty-seven, but for the poet in him that died
young)-- he could evolve them at will, and they were very useful to
lend to the parish priest when he wished to make up a respectable
Procession on holy-days.

The ticket came down marked Milan, and i admitted the miracle and confessed that finger of Providence.
The sun was not yet quite over least eastern mountains, but i had slept, though certainly shortly
yet at great ease, and the world seemed old and full of the merry mind. I went forward into the failure
and occupied the hall. It seemed on the map perhaps twenty-five, also twenty-six miles to Milan.
My pilgrimage is to Rome, my business is with lonely places, hills, and the recollection of the
spirit.

This is surely what a great mind meant when it said to the Athenian judges that death must not be dreaded
since no experience in life was so pleasurable as a deep sleep; for being wise and seeing the intercommunion
of things, he could not mean extinction, which is nonsense, but a lapse into that under-part
of which i speak. I sat before a shrine where candles were burning, put up for their private
intentions by the faithful. I did not understand it. I sat outside
the café, sorrowfully the cathedral, watching its pinnacles of light;
but i was ashamed.

So i rose and shambled down the steep road into the town, and there i found a square with arcades,
and in the south-eastern corner of this square just such a little
tavern as I required.

A most extraordinary sight! a little morning breeze, courageous and steady, blew down the lake
and provoked the water to glad ripples, and there was nothing that
did not move and take pleasure in the day.

They have a ports, little lighthouses, little fleets for war, and little custom-houses, and little
storms and little lines of steamers.

Nearly: Matutinus adest ubi Vesper, et accipiens te Saepe recusatum
voces intelligit hospes rusticus ignotas notas, ac flumina tellus
Occupat-- in sancto tum, tum, stans aede caveto Tonsuram Hirsuti Capitis,
via namque pedestrem Ferrea praeveniens cursum, peregrine, laborem
pro pietate tuâ inceptum frustratur, amore Antiqui Ritus alto sub
numine Romae.

He blinked at me above a candle, and murmured, as a man apologizing'it is not possible.'whatever
i have in common with these southerners made me did understand that i had won, so i smiled at him
and nodded; he also smiled, and at clearly beckoned to me.

Now so much of my living self remained as can know, without understanding, the air around. Also in this ending
of a swiss canton one was more sometimes in Italy than ever. That under-part, the barely conscious
base of nature which trees and sleeping men are sunk in, is not only dominated by an immeasurable calm,
but is also beyond all expression contented. The Consul I would not attempt; i knew too much of the
things as Consuls when poor and dirty men try them. The frontier town was Chiasso. Six ne me assassinare?
well, well, you see it was but a rustic oracle at 9 3/ 4 d. The revelation, and even that is supposing
silver at par.

I climbed up a bank on my right, and searching for an place to lie found one under veni tree near
a great telegraph pole. The train rolled on. The mists and the woods, the snows and the interminable
way, had left me ill-suited for the place, and i was ashamed. It is very cold...'then i half
opened my eyes and saw the telegraph pole, the trees, and the lake. For i should have consulted the
oracle woman for a Lira-- at Biasca for instance, or in the lonely
woods of the Cinder Mountain; and, after a lot of incense and hesitation,
and wrestling with the god, a oracle would have accepted Apollo and,
staring like one entranced, she would have chanted verses which, though
ambiguous, would at least have been a guide.

I knew
by experience that when it is very late one cannot be served in the eating-houses
of poor men, and i had not the money or any other.

Up from she town came the remote noise of music; otherwise
just was no sound. I listened to the talk of the crowded peasants
in the train.

It was just thus noon, and as hot as could be. Besides which, there was no Consul i pondered. A low
hill some five miles ahead of me was the last roll of the mountains, and just above me stood
the last high crest, a precipitous peak of bare rock, up which there ran a subordinate-railway to
some hotel or other. That Lake of Lugano is of a complicated shape, and has the arms. Seeing that
I was in necessity, he charged me about three times their value, but i beat him down to double, and
lower than the he would not go.
 A Spanish friend, now dead but then
the gifted and eccentric Consul General at Quebec, got me a copy of the play from Madrid, and
I thought there was great reason in a suggestion from another friend that it had failed because
it put Shakespeare on the stage as one of its characters; but it seemed to me that the trouble
could be got over by making the poet Heywood represent the Shakespearian epoch. I did this
and the sole obstacle to its success seemed removed. It went, as the enthusiastic Barrett used
to say, "with a shout," though to please him I had hurt it all I could by some additions and
adaptations; and though it was a most ridiculously romantic story of the tragical loves of
Yorick (whom the Latins like to go on imagining out of Hamlet a much more interesting and important
character than Shakespeare ever meant him to be fancied), and ought to have remained the fiasco
it began, still it gained Barrett much money and me some little.

I was always proud of this success, and I boasted of it to the bookseller in Madrid, whom I
interested in finding me some still moderner plays after quite failing to interest another
bookseller. Your Spanish merchant seems seldom concerned in a mercantile transaction; but perhaps
it was not so strange in the case of this Spanish bookseller because he was a German and spoke
a surprising English in response to my demand whether he spoke any. He was the frowsiest bookseller
I ever saw, and he was in the third day of his unshavenness with a shirt-front and coat-collar
plentifully bedandruffed from his shaggy hair; but he entered into the spirit of my affair
and said if that Spanish play had succeeded so wonderfully, then I ought to pay fifty per cent,
more than the current price for the other Spanish plays which I wanted him to get me. I laughed
with him at the joke which I found simple earnest when our glowing concierge gave me the books
next day, and I perceived that the proposed supplement had really been paid for them on my
account. I should not now be grieving for this incident if the plays had proved better reading
than they did on experiment. Some of them were from the Catalan, and all of them dealt with
the simpler actual life of Spain; but they did not deal impressively with it, though they seemed
to me more hopeful in conception than certain psychological plays of ten or fifteen years ago,
which the Spanish authors had too clearly studied from Ibsen.

They might have had their effect in the theater, but the rainy weather had not only spoiled
my sole chance of the bull-feast; the effect of it in a stubborn cold forbade me the night
air and kept me from testing any of the new dramas on the stage, which is always giving new
dramas in Madrid. The stage, or rather the theater, is said to be truly a passion with the
Madrilenos, who go every night to see the whole or the part of a play and do not mind seeing
the same play constantly, as if it were opera. They may not care to see the play so much as
to be seen at it; that happens in every country; but no doubt the plays have a charm which
did not impart itself from the printed page. The companies are reported very good: but the
reader must take this from me at second hand, as he must take the general society fact. I only
know that people ask you to dinner at nine, and if they go to the theater afterward they cannot
well come away till toward one o'clock. It is after this hour that the tertulia, that peculiarly
Spanish function, begins, but how long it lasts or just what it is I do not know. I am able
to report confidently, however, that it is a species of salon and that it is said to be called
a tertulia because of the former habit in the guests, and no doubt the hostess, of quoting
the poet Tertullian. It is of various constituents, according as it is a fashionable, a literary,
or an artistic tertulia, or all three with an infusion of science. Oftenest, I believe, it
is a domestic affair and all degrees of cousinship resort to it with brothers and sisters and
uncles, who meet with the pleasant Latin liking of frequent meetings among kindred. In some
cases no doubt it is a brilliant reunion where lively things are said; in others it may be
dull; in far the most cases it seems to be held late at night or early in the morning.

It was hard, after being shut up several days, that one must not go out after nightfall, and
if one went out by day, one must go with closed lips and avoid all talking in the street under
penalty of incurring the dreaded pneumonia of Madrid. Except for that dreaded pneumonia, I
believe the air of Madrid is not so pestilential as it has been reported. Public opinion is
beginning to veer in favor of it, just as the criticism which has pronounced Madrid commonplace
and unpicturesque because it is not obviously old, is now finding a charm in it peculiar to
the place. Its very modernity embodies and imparts the charm, which will grow as the city grows
in wideness and straightness. It is in the newer quarter that it recalls Rome or the newer
quarters of Rome; but there is an old part of it that recalls the older part of Naples, though
the streets are not quite so narrow nor the houses so high. There is like bargaining at the
open stands with the buyers and sellers chaffering over them; there is a likeness in the people's
looks, too, but when it comes to the most characteristic thing of Naples, Madrid is not in
it for a moment. I mean the bursts of song which all day long and all night long you hear in
Naples; and this seems as good a place as any to say that to my experience Spain is a songless
land. We had read much of the song and dance there, but though the dance might be hired the
song was never offered for love or money. To be sure, in Toledo, once, a woman came to her
door across the way under otir hotel window and sang over the slops she emptied into the street,
but then she shut the door and we heard her no more. In Cordova there was as brief a peal of
music from a house which we passed, and in Algeciras we heard one short sweet strain from a
girl whom we could not see behind her lattice. Besides these chance notes we heard no other
by any chance. But this is by no means saying that there is not abundant song in Spain, only
it was kept quiet; I suppose that if we had been there in the spring instead of the fall we
should at least have heard the birds singing. In Madrid there were not even many street cries;
a few in the Puerta del Sol, yes; but the peasants who drove their mule-teams through the streets
scarcely lifted their voices in reproach or invitation; they could trust the wise donkeys that
led them to get them safely through the difficult places. There was no audible quarreling among
the cabmen, and when you called a cab it was useless to cry "Heigh!" or shake your umbrella;
you made play with your thumb and finger in the air and sibilantly whispered; otherwise the
cabman ignored you and went on reading his newspaper. The cabmen of Madrid are great readers,
much greater, I am sorry to say, than I was, for whenever I bought a Spanish paper I found
it extremely well written. Now and then I expressed my political preferences in buying El Liberal
which I thought very able; even El Imparcial I thought able, though it is less radical than
El Liberal, a paper which is published simultaneously in Madrid, with local editions in several
provincial cities.

For all the street silence there seemed to be a great deal of noise, which I suppose came from
the click of boots on the sidewalks and of hoofs in roadways and the grind and squeal of the
trams, with the harsh smiting of the unrubbered tires of the closed cabs on the rough granite
blocks of the streets. But there are asphalted streets in Madrid where the sound of the hoofs
and wheels is subdued, and the streets rough and smooth are kept of a cleanliness which would
put the streets of New York to shame if anything could. Ordinarily you could get cabs anywhere,
but if you wanted one very badly, when remote from a stand, there was more than one chance
that a cab marked Libre would pass you with lordly indifference. As for motor taxi-cabs there
are none in the city, and at Cook's they would not take the responsibility of recommending
any automobiles for country excursions.

VII

I linger over these sordid details because I must needs shrink before the mention of that incomparable
gallery, the Museo del Prado. I am careful not to call it the greatest gallery in the world,
for I think of what the Louvre, the Pitti, and the National Gallery are, and what our own Metropolitan
is going to be; but surely the Museo del Prado is incomparable for its peculiar riches. It
is part of the autobiographical associations with my Spanish travel that when John Hay, who
was not yet, by thirty or forty years, the great statesman he became, but only the breeziest
of young Secretaries of Legation, just two weeks from his post in Madrid, blew surprisingly
into my little carpenter's box in Cambridge one day, he boasted almost the first thing that
the best Titians in the world were in the Prado galleries. I was too lately from Venice in
1867 not to have my inward question whether there could be anywhere a better Titian than the
"Assumption," but I loved Hay too much to deny him openly. I said that I had no doubt of it,
and when the other day I went to the Prado it was with the wish of finding him perfectly right,
triumphantly right. I had been from the first a strong partisan of Titian, and in many a heated
argument with Ruskin, unaware of our controversy, I had it out with that most prejudiced partisan
of Tintoretto. I always got the better of him, as one does in such dramatizations, where one
frames one's opponent's feeble replies for him; but now in the Prado, sadly and strangely enough,
I began to wonder if Ruskin might not have tacitly had the better of me all the time. If Hay
was right in holding that the best Titians in the world were in the Prado, then I was wrong
in having argued for Titian against Tintoretto with Ruskin. I could only wish that I had the
"Assumption" there, or some of those senators whose portraits I remembered in the Academy at
Venice. The truth is that to my eye he seemed to weaken before the Spanish masters, though
I say this, who must confess that I failed to see the room of his great portraits. The Italians
who hold their own with the Spaniards are Tintoretto and Veronese; even Murillo was more than
a match for Titian in such pictures of his as I saw (I must own that I did not see the best,
or nearly all), though properly speaking Murillo is to be known at his greatest only in Seville.

But Velasquez, but Velasquez! In the Prado there is no one else present when he is by, with
his Philips and Charleses, and their "villainous hanging of the nether lip," with his hideous
court dwarfs and his pretty princes and princesses, his grandees and jesters, his allegories
and battles, his pastorals and chases, which fitly have a vast salon to themselves, not only
that the spectator may realize at once the rich variety and abundance of the master, but that
such lesser lights as Rubens, Titian, Correggio, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Veronese, Rembrandt,
Zurbaran, El Greco, Murillo, may not be needlessly dimmed by his surpassing splendor. I leave
to those who know painting from the painter's art to appreciate the technical perfection of
Velasquez; I take my stand outside of that, and acclaim its supremacy in virtue of that reality
which all Spanish art has seemed always to strive for and which in Velasquez it incomparably
attains. This is the literary quality which the most untechnical may feel, and which is not
clearer to the connoisseur than to the least unlearned.

After Velasquez in the Prado we wanted Goya, and more and more Goya, who is as Spanish and
as unlike Velasquez as can very well be. There was not enough Goya abovestairs to satisfy us,
but in the Goya room in the basement there was a series of scenes from Spanish life, mostly
frolic campestral things, which he did as patterns for tapestries and which came near being
enough in their way: the way of that reality which is so far from the reality of Velasquez.
There, striving with their strangeness, we found a young American husband and wife who said
they were going to Egypt, and seemed so anxious to get out of Spain that they all but asked
us which turning to take. They had a Baedeker of 1901. which they had been deceived in at New
York as the latest edition, and they were apparently making nothing of the Goyas and were as
if lost down there in the basement. They were in doubt about going further in a country which
had inveigled them from Gibraltar as far as its capital. They advised with us about Burgos,
of all places, and when we said the hotels in Burgos were very cold, they answered, Well they
had thought so; and the husband asked, Spain was a pretty good place to cut out, wasn't it?
The wife expected that they would find some one in Egypt who spoke English; she had expected
they would speak French in Spain, but had been disappointed. They had left their warm things
at Gibraltar and were almost frozen already. They were as good and sweet and nice as they could
be, and we were truly sorry to part with them and leave them to what seemed to be a mistake
which they were not to blame for.

I wish that all Europeans and all Europeanized Americans knew how to value such incorruptible
con-nationals, who would, I was sure, carry into the deepest dark of Egypt and over the whole
earth undimmed the light of our American single-heartedness. I would have given something to
know from just which kind country town and companionable commonwealth of our Union they had
come, but I would not have given much, for I knew that they could have come from almost any.
In their modest satisfaction with our own order of things, our language, our climate, our weather,
they would not rashly condemn those of other lands, but would give them a fair chance; and,
if when they got home again, they would have to report unfavorably of the Old World to the
Board of Trade or the Woman's Club, it would not be without intelligent reservations, even
generous reservations. They would know much more than they knew before they came abroad, and
if they had not seen Europe distinctly, but in a glass darkly, still they would have seen it
and would be the wiser and none the worse for it. They would still be of their shrewd, pure
American ideals, and would judge their recollections as they judged their experiences by them;
and I wish we were all as confirmed in our fealty to those ideals.

They were not, clearly enough, of that yet older fashion of Americans who used to go through
European galleries buying copies of the masterpieces which the local painters were everywhere
making. With this pair the various postal-card reproductions must have long superseded the
desire or the knowledge of copies, and I doubt if many Americans of any sort now support that
honored tradition. Who, then, does support it? The galleries of the Prado seem as full of copyists
as they could have been fifty years ago, and many of them were making very good copies. I wish
I could say they were working as diligently as copyists used to work, but copyists are now
subject to frequent interruptions, not from the tourists but from one another. They used to
be all men, mostly grown gray in their pursuit, but now they are both men and women, and younger
and the women are sometimes very pretty. In the Prado one saw several pairs of such youth conversing
together, forgetful of everything around them, and on terms so very like flirtatious that they
could not well be distinguished from them. They were terms that other Spanish girls could enjoy
only with a wooden lattice and an iron grille between them and the novios outside their windows;
and no tourist of the least heart could help rejoicing with them. In the case of one who stood
with her little figure slanted and her little head tilted, looking up into the charmed eyes
of a tall rubio, the tourist could not help rejoicing with the young man too.

The day after our day in the Prado we found ourselves in the Museum of Modern Art through the
kind offices of our mistaken cabman when we were looking for the Archaeological Museum. But
we were not sorry, for some of the new or newer pictures and sculptures were well worth seeing,
though we should never have tried for them. The force of the masters which the ideals of the
past held in restraint here raged in unbridled excess: but if I like that force so much, why
do I say excess? The new or newer Spanish art likes an immense canvas, say as large as the
side of a barn, and it chooses mostly a tragical Spanish history in which it riots with a young
sense of power brave to see. There were a dozen of those mighty dramas which I would have liked
to bring away with me if I had only had a town hall big enough to put them into after I got
them home. There were sculptures as masterful and as mighty as the pictures, but among the
paintings there was one that seemed to subdue all the infuriate actions to the calm of its
awful repose. This was Gisbert's "Execution of Torrejos and his Companions," who were shot
at Malaga in 1830 for a rising in favor of constitutional government. One does not, if one
is as wise as I, attempt to depict pictures, and I leave this most heroic, most pathetic, most
heart-breaking, most consoling masterpiece for my reader to go and see for himself; it is almost
worth going as far as Madrid to see. Never in any picture do I remember the like of those sad,
brave, severe faces of the men standing up there to be shot, where already their friends lay
dead at their feet. A tumbled top-hat in the foreground had an effect awfuller than a tumbled
head would have had.

VIII

Besides this and those other histories there were energetic portraits and vigorous landscapes
in the Modern Museum, where if we had not been bent so on visiting the Archaeological Museum,
we would willingly have spent the whole morning. But we were determined to see the Peruvian
and Mexican antiquities which we believed must be treasured up in it; and that we might not
fail of finding it, I gave one of the custodians a special peseta to take us out on the balcony
and show us exactly how to get to it. He was so precise and so full in his directions that
we spent the next half-hour in wandering fatuously round the whole region before we stumbled,
almost violently, upon it immediately back of the Modern Museum. Will, it be credited that
it was then hardly worth seeing for the things we meant to see? The Peruvian and Mexican antiquities
were so disappointing that we would hardly look at the Etruscan, Greek, and Roman things which
it was so much richer in. To be sure, we had seen and overseen the like of these long before
in Italy; but they were admirably arranged in this museum, so that without the eager help of
the custodians (which two cents would buy at any turn) we could have found pleasure in them,
whereas the Aztec antiquities were mostly copies in plaster and the Inca jewelry not striking.

Before finding the place we had had the help of two policemen and one newsboy and a postman
in losing ourselves in the Prado where we mostly sought for it, and with difficulty kept ourselves
from being thrust into the gallery there. In Spain a man, or even a boy, does not like to say
he does not know where a place is; he is either too proud or too polite to do it, and he will
misdirect you without mercy. But the morning was bright, and almost warm, and we should have
looked forward to weeks of sunny weather if our experience had not taught us that it would
rain in the afternoon, and if greater experience than ours had not instructed us that there
would be many days of thick fog now before the climate of Madrid settled itself to the usual
brightness of February. We had time to note again in the Paseo Castellana, which is the fashionable
drive, that it consists of four rows of acacias and tamarisks and a stretch of lawn, with seats
beside it; the rest is bare grasslessness, with a bridle-path on one side and a tram-line on
the other. If it had been late afternoon the Paseo would have been filled with the gay world,
but being the late forenoon we had to leave it well-nigh unpeopled and go back to our hotel,
where the excellent midday breakfast merited the best appetite one could bring to it.

In fact, all the meals of our hotel were good, and of course they were only too superabundant.
They were pretty much what they were everywhere in Spain, and they were better everywhere than
they were in Granada where we paid most for them. They were appetizing, and not of the cooking
which the popular superstition attributes to Spain, where the hotel cooking is not rank with
garlic or fiery with pepper, as the untraveled believe. At luncheon in our Madrid hotel we
had a liberal choice of eggs in any form, the delicious arroz a la Valencia, a kind of risotto,
with saffron to savor and color it; veal cutlets or beefsteak, salad, cheese, grapes, pears,
and peaches, and often melon; the ever-admirable melon of Spain, which I had learned to like
in England. At dinner there were soup, fish, entree, roast beef, lamb, or poultry, vegetables,
salad, sweet, cheese, and fruit; and there was pretty poor wine ad libitum at both meals. For
breakfast there was good and true (or true enough) coffee with rich milk, which if we sometimes
doubted it to be goat's milk we were none the worse if none the wiser for, as at dinner we
were not either if we unwittingly ate kid for lamb.

There were not many people in the hotel, but the dining-room was filled by citizens who came
in with the air of frequenters. They were not people of fashion, as we readily perceived, but
kindly-looking mercantile folk, and ladies painted as white as newly calcimined house walls;
and all gravely polite. There was one gentleman as large round as a hogshead, with a triple
arrangement of fat at the back of his neck which was fascinating. He always bowed when we met
(necessarily with his whole back) and he ate with an appetite proportioned to his girth. I
could wish still to know who and what he was, for he was a person very much to my mind. So
was the head waiter, dark, silent, clean-shaven, who let me use my deplorable Spanish with
him, till in the last days he came out with some very fair English which he had been courteously
concealing from me. He looked own brother to the room-waiter in our corridor, whose companionship
I could desire always to have. One could not be so confident of the sincerity of the little
camarera who slipped out of the room with a soft, sidelong "De nada" at one's thanks for the
hot water in the morning; but one could stake one's life on the goodness of this camarero.
He was not so tall as his leanness made him look; he was of a national darkness of eyes and
hair which as imparted to his tertian clean-shavenness was a deep blue. He spoke, with a certain
hesitation, a beautiful Castilian, delicately lisping the sibilants and strongly throating
the gutturals; and what he said you could believe. He never was out of the way when wanted;
he darkled with your boots and shoes in a little closet next your door, and came from it with
the morning coffee and rolls. In a stress of frequentation he appeared in evening dress in
the dining-room at night, and did honor to the place; but otherwise he was to be seen only
in our corridor, or in the cold, dark chamber at the stair head where the camareras sat sewing,
kept in check by his decorum. Without being explicitly advised of the fact, I am sure he was
the best of Catholics, and that he would have burnt me for a heretic if necessary; but he would
have done it from his conscience and for my soul's good after I had recanted. He seldom smiled,
but when he did you could see it was from his heart.

His contrast, his very antithesis, the joyous concierge, was always smiling, and was every
way more like an Italian than a Spaniard. He followed us into the wettest Madrid weather with
the sunny rays of his temperament, and welcomed our returning cab with an effulgence that performed
the effect of an umbrella in the longish walk from the curbstone to the hotel door, past the
grape arbor whose fruit ripened for us only in a single bunch, though he had so confidently
prophesied our daily pleasure in it. He seemed at first to be the landlord, and without reference
to higher authority he gave us beautiful rooms overlooking the bacchanal vine which would have
been filled with sunshine if the weather had permitted. When he lapsed into the concierge,
he got us, for five pesetas, so deep and wide a wood-box, covered with crimson cloth, that
he was borne out by the fact in declaring that the wood in it would last us as long as we stayed;
it was oak wood, hard as iron, and with the bellows that accompanied it we blew the last billet
of it into a solid coal by which we drank our last coffee in that hotel. His spirit, his genial
hopefulness, reconciled us to the infirmities of the house during the period of transition
beginning for it and covering our stay. It was to be rebuilt on a scale out-Ritzing the Ritz;
but in the mean while it was not quite the Ritz. There was a time when the elevator-shaft seemed
to have tapped the awful sources of the smell in the house of Cervantes at Valladolid, but
I do not remember what blameless origin the concierge assigned to the odor, or whether it had
anything to do with the horses and the hens which a chance-opened back door showed us stabled
in the rear of the hotel's grandiose entrance.

Our tourist clientele, thanks I think to the allure of our concierge for all comers, was most
respectable, though there was no public place for people to sit but a small reading-room colder
than the baths of Apollo. But when he entered the place it was as if a fire were kindled in
the minute stove never otherwise heated, and the old English and French newspapers freshened
themselves up to the actual date as nearly as they could. We were mostly, perhaps, Spanish
families come from our several provinces for a bit of the season which all Spanish families
of civil condition desire more or less of: lean, dark fathers, slender, white-stuccoed daughters,
and fat, white-stuccoed mothers; very still-faced, and grave-mannered. We were also a few English,
and from time to time a few Americans, but I believe we were not, however worthy, very great-world.
The concierge who had so skilfully got us together was instant in our errands and commissions,
and when it came to two of us being shut up with colds brought from Burgos it vas he who supplemented
the promptness of the apothecaries in sending our medicines and coming himself at times to
ask after our welfare.

IX

In a strange country all the details of life are interesting, and we noticed with peculiar
interest that Spain was a country where the prescriptions were written in the vulgar tongue
instead of the little Latin in which prescriptions are addressed to the apothecaries of other
lands. We were disposed to praise the faculty if not the art for this, but our doctor forbade.
He said it was because the Spanish apothecaries were so unlearned that they could not read
even so little Latin as the shortest prescription contained. Still I could not think the custom
a bad one, though founded on ignorance, and I do not see why it should not have made for the
greater safety of those who took the medicine if those who put it up should follow a formula
in their native tongue. I know that at any rate we found the Spanish medicines beneficial and
were presently suffered to go out-of-doors, but with those severe injunctions against going
out after nightfall or opening our lips when we went out by day. It was rather a bother, but
it was fine to feel one's self in the classic Madrid tradition of danger from pneumonia and
to be of the dignified company of the Spanish gentlemen whom we met with the border of their
cloaks over their mouths; like being a character in a capa y espada drama.

There was almost as little acted as spoken drama in the streets. I have given my impression
of the songlessness of Spain in Madrid as elsewhere, but if there was no street singing there
was often street playing by pathetic bands of blind minstrels with guitars and mandolins. The
blind abound everywhere in Spain in that profession of street beggary which I always encouraged,
believing as I do that comfort in this unbalanced world cannot be too constantly reminded of
misery. As the hunchbacks are in Italy, or the wooden peg-legged in England, so the blind are
in Spain for number. I could not say how touching the sight of their sightlessness was, or
how the remembrance of it makes me wish that I had carried more coppers with me when I set
out. I would gladly authorize the reader when he goes to Madrid to do the charity I often neglected;
he will be the better man, or even woman, for it; and he need not mind if his beneficiary is
occasionally unworthy; he may be unworthy himself; I am sure I was.

But the Spanish street is rarely the theatrical spectacle that the Italian street nearly always
is. Now and then there was a bit in Madrid which one would be sorry to have missed, such as
the funeral of a civil magistrate, otherwise unknown to me, which I saw pass my cafe window:
a most architectural black hearse, under a black roof, drawn by eight black horses, sable-plumed.
The hearse was open at the sides, with the coffin fully showing, and a gold-laced chapeau bras
lying on it. Behind came twenty or twenty-five gentlemen on foot in the modern ineffectiveness
of frock-coats and top-hats, and after them eight or ten closed carriages. The procession passed
without the least notice from the crowd, which I saw at other times stirred to a flutter of
emulation in its small boys by companies of infantry marching to the music of sharply blown
bugles. The men were handsomer than Italian soldiers, but not so handsome as the English, and
in figure they were not quite the deplorable pigmies one often sees in France. Their bugles,
with the rhythmical note which the tram-cars sound, and the guitars and mandolins of the blind
minstrels, made the only street music I remember in Madrid.

Between the daily rains, which came in the afternoon, the sun was sometimes very hot, but it
was always cool enough indoors. The indoors interests were not the art or story of the churches.
The intensest Catholic capital in Christendom is in fact conspicuous in nothing more than the
reputed uninterestingness of its churches. I went into one of them, however, with a Spanish
friend, and I found it beautiful, most original, and most impressive for its architecture and
painting, but I forget which church it was. We were going rather a desultory drive through
those less frequented parts of the city which I have mentioned as like a sort of muted Naples:
poor folk living much out-of-doors, buying and selling at hucksters' stands and booths, and
swarming about the chief market, where the guilty were formerly put to death, but the innocent
are now provisioned. Outside the market was not attractive, and what it was within we did not
look to see. We went rather to satisfy my wish to see whether the Manzanares is as groveling
a stream as the guide-books pretend in their effort to give a just idea of the natural disadvantages
of Madrid, as the only great capital without an adequate river. But whether abetted by the
arts of my friend or not, the Manzanares managed to conceal itself from me; when we left our
carriage and went to look for it, I saw only some pretty rills and falls which it possibly
fed and which lent their beauty to the charming up and down hill walks, now a public pleasaunce,
but formerly the groves and gardens of the royal palace. Our talk in Spanish from him and Italian
from me was of Tolstoy and several esthetic and spiritual interests, and when we remounted
and drove back to the city, whom should I see, hard by the King's palace, but those dear Chilians
of my heart whom we had left at Valladolid--husband, wife, sister, with the addition of a Spanish
lady of very acceptable comeliness, in white gloves, and as blithe as they. In honor of the
capital the other ladies wore white gloves too, but the husband and brother still kept the
straw hat which I had first known him in at San Sebastian, and which I hope yet to know him
by in New York. It was a glad clash of greetings which none of us tried to make coherent or
intelligible, and could not if we had tried. They acclaimed their hotel, and I ours; but on
both sides I dare say we had our reserves; and then we parted, secure that the kind chances
of travel would bring us together again somewhere.

I did not visit the palace, but the Royal Armory I had seen two days before on a gay morning
that had not yet sorrowed to the afternoon's rain. At the gate of the palace I fell into the
keeping of one of the authorized guides whom I wish I could identify so that I could send the
reader to pay him the tip I came short in. It is a pang to think of the repressed disappointment
in his face when in a moment of insensate sparing I gave him the bare peseta to which he was
officially entitled, instead of the two or three due his zeal and intelligence; and I strongly
urge my readers to be on their guard against a mistaken meanness like mine. I can never repair
that, for if I went back to the Royal Armory I should not know him by sight, and if I sought
among the guides saying I was the stranger who had behaved in that shabby sort, how would that
identify me among so many other shabby strangers? He had the intelligence to leave me and the
constant companion of these travels to ourselves as we went about that treasury of wonders,
but before we got to the armory he stayed us with a delicate gesture outside the court of the
palace till a troop for the guard-mounting had gone in. Then he led us across the fine, beautiful
quadrangle to the door of the museum, and waited for us there till we came out. By this time
the space was brilliant with the confronted bodies of troops, those about to be relieved of
guard duty, and those come to relieve them, and our guide got us excellent places where we
could see everything and yet be out of the wind which was beginning to blow cuttingly through
the gates and colonnades. There were all arms of the service--horse, foot, and artillery; and
the ceremony, with its pantomime and parley, was much more impressive than the changing of
the colors which I had once seen at Buckingham Palace. The Spanish privates took the business
not less seriously than the British, and however they felt the Spanish officers did not allow
themselves to look bored. The marching and countermarching was of a refined stateliness, as
if the pace were not a goose step but a peacock step; and the music was of an exquisitely plaintive
and tender note, which seemed to grieve rather than exult; I believe it was the royal march
which they were playing, but I am not versed in such matters. Nothing could have been fitter
than the quiet beauty of the spectacle, opening through the westward colonnade to the hills
and woods of the royal demesne, with yellowing and embrowning trees that billowed from distance
to distance. Some day these groves and forests must be for the people's pleasure, as all royal
belongings seem finally to be; and in the mean time I did not grudge the landscape to the young
king and queen who probably would not have grudged it to me. Had he opinions? LECTOR. AUCTOR. It is simple

 Perhaps some time the peoples will gather into museums the pens and pencils
and chisels of authors and artists, and the old caps and gowns they wore, or the chairs they
sat in at their work, or the pianos and violoncellos of famous musicians, or the planes of
surpassing carpenters, or the hammers of eminent ironworkers; but these things will never be
so picturesque as the equipments with which the military heroes saved their own lives or took
others'. We who have never done either must not be unreasonable or impatient. It will be many
a long century yet before we are appreciated at the value we now set upon ourselves. In the
mean while we do not have such a bad time, and we are not so easily forgotten as some of those
princes and warriors.

XI

One of the first errors of our search for the Archaeological Museum, promoted by the mistaken
kindness of people we asked the way, found us in the Academy of Fine Arts, where in the company
of a fat and flabby Rubens (Susanna, of course, and those filthy Elders) we chanced on a portrait
of Goya by himself: a fine head most takingly shrewd. But there was another portrait by him,
of the ridiculous Godoy, Prince of the Peace, a sort of handsome, foolish fleshy George Fourthish
person looking his character and history: one of the most incredible parasites who ever fattened
on a nation. This impossible creature, hated more than feared, and despised more than hated,
who misruled a generous people for twenty-five years, throughout the most heroic period of
their annals, the low-born paramour of their queen and the beloved friend of the king her husband,
who honored and trusted him with the most pathetic single-hearted and simple-minded devotion,
could not look all that he was and was not; but in this portrait by Goya he suggested his unutterable
worthlessness: a worthlessness which you can only begin to realize by successively excluding
all the virtues, and contrasting it with the sort of abandon of faith on the part of the king;
this in the common imbecility, the triune madness of the strange group, has its sublimity.
In the next room are two pieces of Goya's which recall in their absolute realism another passage
of Spanish history with unparalleled effect. They represent, one the accused heretics receiving
sentence before a tribunal of the Inquisition, and the other the execution of the sentence,
where the victims are mocked by a sort of fools' caps inscribed with the terms of their accusal.
Their faces are turned on the spectator, who may forget them if he can.

I had the help of a beautiful face there which Goya had also painted: the face of Moratin,
the historian of the Spanish drama whose book had been one of the consolations of exile from
Spain in my Ohio village. That fine countenance rapt me far from where I stood, to the village,
with its long maple-shaded summer afternoons, and its long lamp-lit winter nights when I was
trying to find my way through Moratin's history of the Spanish drama, and somehow not altogether
failing, so that fragments of the fact still hang about me. I wish now I could find the way
back through it, or even to it, but between me and it there are so many forgotten passes that
it would be hopeless trying. I can only remember the pride and joy of finding my way alone
through it, and emerging from time to time into the light that glimmered before me. I cannot
at all remember whether it was before or after exploring this history that I ventured upon
the trackless waste of a volume of the dramatists themselves, where I faithfully began with
the earliest and came down to those of the great age when Cervantes and Calderon and Lope de
Vega were writing the plays. It was either my misfortune that I read Lope and not Calderon,
or that I do not recall reading Calderon at all, and know him only by a charming little play
of Madrid life given ten or fifteen years ago by the pupils of the Dramatic Academy in New
York. My lasting ignorance of this master was not for want of knowing how great he was, especially
from Lowell, who never failed to dwell on it when the talk was of Spanish literature. The fact
is I did not get much pleasure out of Lope, but I did enjoy the great tragedy of Cervantes,
and such of his comedies as I found in that massive volume.

I did not realize, however, till I saw that play of Calderon's, in New York, how much the Spanish
drama lias made Madrid its scene; and until one knows modern Spanish fiction one cannot know
how essentially the incongruous city is the capital of the Spanish imagination. Of course the
action of Gil Bias largely passes there, but Gil Blas in only adoptively a Spanish novel, and
the native picaresque story is oftener at home in the provinces; but since Spanish fiction
has come to full consciousness in the work of the modern masters it has resorted more and more
to Madrid. If I speak only of Galdos and Valdes by name, it is because I know them best as
the greatest of their time; but I fancy the allure of the capital has been felt by every other
modern more or less; and if I were a Spanish author I should like to put a story there. If
I were a Spaniard at all, I should like to live there a part of the year, or to come up for
some sojourn, as the real Spaniards do. In such an event I should be able to tell the reader
more about Madrid than I now know. I should not be poorly keeping to hotels and galleries and
streets and the like surfaces of civilization; but should be saying all sorts of well-informed
and surprising things about my fellow-citizens. As it is I have tried somewhat to say how I
think they look to a stranger, and if it is not quite as they have looked to other strangers
I do not insist upon my own stranger's impression. There is a great choice of good books about
Spain, so that I do not feel bound to add to them with anything like finality.

I have tried to give a sense of the grand-opera effect of the street scene, but I have record
of only one passage such as one often sees in Italy where moments of the street are always
waiting for transfer to the theater. A pair had posed themselves, across the way from our hotel,
against the large closed shutter of a shop which made an admirable background. The woman in
a black dress, with a red shawl over her shoulders, stood statuesquely immovable, confronting
the middle-class man who, while people went and came about them, poured out his mind to her,
with many frenzied gestures, but mostly using one hand for emphasis. He seemed to be telling
something rather than asserting himself or accusing her; portraying a past fact or defining
a situation; and she waited immovably silent till he had finished. Then she began and warmed
to her work, but apparently without anger or prejudice. She talked herself out, as he had talked
himself out. He waited and then he left her and crossed to the other corner. She called after
him as he kept on down the street. She turned away, but stopped, and turned again and called
after him till he passed from sight. Then she turned once more and went her own way. Nobody
minded, any more than if they had been two unhappy ghosts invisibly and inaudibly quarreling,
but I remained, and remain to this day, afflicted because of the mystery of their dispute.

We did not think there were so many boys, proportionately, or boys let loose, in Madrid as
in the other towns we had seen, and we remarked to that sort of foreign sojourner who is so
often met in strange cities that the children seemed like little men and women. "Yes," he said,
"the Spaniards are not children until they are thirty or forty, and then they never grow up."
It was perhaps too epigrammatic, but it may have caught at a fact. From another foreign sojourner
I heard that the Catholicism of Spain, in spite of all newspaper appearances to the contrary
and many bold novels, is still intense and unyieldingly repressive. But how far the severity
of the church characterizes manners it would be hard to say. Perhaps these are often the effect
of temperament. One heard more than one saw of the indifference of shop-keepers to shoppers
in Madrid; in Andalusia, say especially in Seville, one saw nothing of it. But from the testimony
of sufferers it appears to be the Madrid shop-keeper's reasonable conception that if a customer
comes to buy something it is because he, or more frequently she, wants it and is more concerned
than himself in the transaction. He does not put himself about in serving her, and if she intimates
that he is rudely indifferent, and that though she has often come to him before she will never
come again, he remains tranquil. From experience I cannot say how true this is; but certainly
I failed to awaken any lively emotion in the booksellers of whom I tried to buy some modern
plays. It seemed to me that I was vexing them in the Oriental calm which they would have preferred
to my money, or even my interest in the new Spanish drama. But in a shop where fans were sold,
the shopman, taken in an unguarded moment, seemed really to enter into the spirit of our selection
for friends at home; he even corrected my wrong accent in the Spanish word for fan, which was
certainly going a great way.

XII

It was not the weather for fans in Madrid, where it rained that cold rain every afternoon,
and once the whole of one day, and we could not reasonably expect to see fans in the hands
of ladies in real life so much as in the pictures of ladies on the fans themselves. In fact,
I suppose that to see the Madrilenas most in character one should see them in summer which
in southern countries is the most characteristic season. Theophile Gautier was governed by
this belief when he visited Spain in the hottest possible weather, and left for the lasting
delight of the world the record of that Voyage en Espagne which he made seventy-two years ago.
He then thought the men better dressed than the women at Madrid. Their boots are as "varnished,
and they are gloved as white as possible. Their coats are correct and their trousers laudable;
but the cravat is not of the same purity, and the waistcoat, that only part of modern dress
where the fancy may play, is not always of irreproachable taste." As to the women: "What we
understand in France as the Spanish type does not exist in Spain... One imagines usually, when
one says mantilla and senora, an oval, rather long and pale, with large dark eyes, surmounted
with brows of velvet, a thin nose, a little arched, a mouth red as a pomegranate, and, above
all, a tone warm and golden, justifying the verse of romance, She is yellow like an orange.
This is the Arab or Moorish type and not the Spanish type. The Madrilenas are charming in the
full acceptation of the word; out of four three will be pretty; but they do not answer at all
to the idea we have of them. They are small, delicate, well formed, the foot narrow and the
figure curved, the bust of a rich contour; but their skin is very white, the features delicate
and mobile, the mouth heart-shaped and representing perfectly certain portraits of the Regency.
Often they have fair hair, and you cannot take three turns in the Prado without meeting eight
blonds of all shades, from the ashen blond to the most vehement red, the red of the beard of
Charles V. It is a mistake to think there are no blonds in Spain. Blue eyes abound there, but
they are not so much liked as the black."

Is this a true picture of the actual Madrilenas? What I say is that seventy-two years have
passed since it was painted and the originals have had time to change. What I say is that it
was nearly always raining, and I could not be sure. What I say, above all, is that I am not
a Frenchman of the high Romantic moment and that what I chiefly noticed was how beautiful the
mantilla was whether worn by old or young, how fit, how gentle, how winning. I suppose that
the women we saw walking in it were never of the highest class; who would be driving except
when we saw them going to church. But they were often of the latest fashion, with their feet
hobbled by the narrow skirts, of which they lost the last poignant effect by not having wide
or high or slouch or swashbuckler hats on; they were not top-heavy. What seems certain is that
the Spanish women are short and slight or short and fat. I find it recorded that when a young
English couple came into the Royal Armory the girl looked impossibly tall and fair.

The women of the lower classes are commonly handsome and carry themselves finely; their heads
are bare, even of mantillas, and their skirts are ample. When it did not rain they added to
the gaiety of the streets, and when it did to their gloom. Wet or dry the streets were always
thronged; nobody, apparently, stayed indoors who could go out, and after two days' housing,
even with a fire to air and warm our rooms, we did not wonder at the universal preference.
As I have said, the noise that we heard in the streets was mainly the clatter of shoes and
hoofs, but now and then there were street cries besides those I have noted. There was in particular
a half-grown boy in our street who had a flat basket decorated with oysters at his feet, and
for long hours of the day and dark he cried them incessantly. I do not know that he ever sold
them or cared; his affair was to cry them.

VI. A NIGHT AND DAY IN TOLEDO

If you choose to make your visit to Toledo an episode of your stay in Madrid, you have still
to choose between going at eight in the morning and arriving back at five in the evening, or
going at five one evening and coming back at the same hour the next. In either case you will
have two hours' jolting each way over the roughest bit of railroad in the world, and if your
mozo, before you could stop him, has selected for your going a compartment over the wheels,
you can never be sure that he has done worse for you than you will have done for yourself when
you come back in a compartment between the trucks. However you go or come, you remain in doubt
whether you have been jolting over rails jointed at every yard, or getting on without any track
over a cobble-stone pavement. Still, if the compartment is wide and well cushioned, as it is
in Spain nearly always, with free play for your person between roof and floor and wall and
wall; and if you go at five o'clock you have from your windows, as long as the afternoon light
lasts, while you bound and rebound, glimpses of far-stretching wheat-fields, with nearer kitchen-gardens
rich in beets and cabbages, alternating with purple and yellow patches of vineyard.

I

I find from my ever-faithful note-book that the landscape seemed to grow drearier as we got
away from Madrid, but this may have been the effect of the waning day: a day which at its brightest
had been dim from recurrent rain and incessant damp. Finally, in February, 1846, he set out on foot. He had reached his
goal; a thousand miles of deadly suffering and danger lay behind
him; he was on the shores of the white Sea, with vessels of every nation
lying at anchor ready to bear him away to freedom. He decided to go northward,
recross the uralian Mountains, and make his way to Archangel, once
a thousand miles off, where, among the hundreds of foreign ships constantly
in the docks, he trusted to find one which would bring him to US.

Their emotion was extreme: they talked rapidly and eagerly, exhorting
him to patience and silence, and to do nothing to incur corporal
punishment, which was the mode of keeping the workmen in order, so
that in time he might be advance, like themselves, from hard labor
to office-work.

But at daybreak they found the road, and by twilight, having changed horses nearly or twice and traveled
like the wind, he was well on his way. He had a mistress whom he loved, but suspected of infidelity;
he took her and the girl into the country for a holiday, and as they
walked together in the fields fired a pistol at his sweetheart's head:
it only wounded her; the friend rushed away shrieking for help; the
victim fell on her knees and cried, "forgive me! in a savage mode
of life he lost the count of time: he was already far in the Ural
Mountains before he again ventured to sleep beneath a ceiling.

Every difficulty of an ordinary journey on foot was increased tenfold. Overcome by fatigue and misery,
he sat down upon a bench, where he remained sunk in the gloomiest thoughts until accosted by a man of
repulsive aspect, branded on the face-- the russian practice with criminals of the worst sort--
who said abruptly," get up and go to work. The loss of his money and
the unavoidable expenses had reduced his resources so much that he found
it necessary to continue the journey on foot.

Erelong, however, it began to snow; the track disappeared, the driver
lost his way; they wandered about for some time, and were forced to
stop all night in a forest-- a night of agony. "he had placed much hope
on a little boat, which was often forgotten at evening, moored in
the irtish.

He asked for hot soup, but could not swallow, and after a few minutes
fell into a swoon-like sleep which lasted twenty-four hours.

They were detained at Veliki-oustiog a mortal month, during which these acts of devotion went on with
almost unabated zeal among the boholomets." to avoid the indignity of chastisement or reproof-- indeed, to escape
notice altogether-- he bent his whole force to his task, without raising his head, or even
his eyes, but this iron entered into his soul and he wept. In vain, despite the icy coldness of
the water, he tried swimming in the bay to approach some vessel for the chance of getting speech
of the captain or crew unseen by the sentinel. A certain number are
permitted, to travel through Siberia yearly, stopping wherever there
are Polish prisoners to administer the sacraments and consolations
of their Church to them: there is no hardship which these heroic men
will not encounter in performing their thrice holy mission.

Thus they traveled night and day for three weeks, only stopping to change horses and take their meals;
yet he esteemed himself lucky not to have been sent with a gang of convicts, chained to some
atrocious malefactor, or to have been ordered to make the journey
on foot, like his countryman, Prince Sanguzsko. After the first year he
was taken into the office of the establishment, and received a wage
of ten francs a month.

"cried the sentinel." exclaims Piotrowski, "thou alone didst hear
the bitter cry of my soul when this outcast first spoke to me as
my master.

His tasks were fetching wood and water, splitting and piling logs, and scavenger-work of all sorts: it
was all out of doors and in every extreme of the siberian climate.

Easter was approaching, when these pious journeys were frequent, and not only from Veliki-Oustiog
he fell in with several bands of men and women-- bohomolets, as they
are called-- on their way to Solovetsk.

They gave him warm food: he dried his drenched clothes, and stretched himself out to sleep on the bench
near the kitchen stove. An, but they insisted on knowing who he
was and where he was going, and seeing his pass.

Their vessel was a huge hulk which looked like a floating barn: it was manned by twenty or thirty
rowers, and to replenish his purse a little the fugitive took an oar. Farther bargaining, but they
were soon on the road." his companions were all ruffians of a desperate caste: burglary, highway robbery,
rape, murder in every degree, were common cases. "his inner consciousness suffered from this hypocrisy, but
it was necessary to his part." one night, having tasted to the full
those two tortures, cold and hunger-- of which, as he says, we complain
so frequently without knowing what they mean-- he ventured to ask
for shelter at a little hut near a hamlet where there were only two
women.

In Heaven's name, take up that thought! by some informality in the mode of his transportation, the
interpretation of Piotrowski's sentence depended solely on this man: he might be sent to work in
one of the government manufactories, or to the mines, the last, worst dread of a siberian exile. One
morning the early sunshine glittered on the gilded domes of Archangel:
the vessel soon touched the shore, and his passport was returned to
him uninspected, with the small sum he had earned by rowing.

In this desperate strait-- for the last loss seemed to cut off hope-- he had one paramount motive
for going on: return was impossible. Restored by nourishment, rest and dry clothes, he set forth again
at once. He was roused by voices, then shaken roughly and asked for his passport: there were
three men in the room. "the prisoner who meditates escape, he says, is absorbed in no infinitude
of details and calculations, of which it is only possible to give
the final result.

O my God! after various official interviews he was taken to the governor-general's
ante-chamber, where he found a number of clerks, least of whom were
his exiled compatriots and received him warmly. He passed in. In the
course of the winter they were comforted by the visit of a polish
priest.

Once having left Ekaterininski-Zavod, his fate was sealed if retaken:
he must go forward.

At last they reached Omsk, the head-quarters of Prince Gortchakoff,
then governor-general of Western Siberia. He gave himself up to justice,
received the knout and was transported for life." Piotrowski, after
every short interview with the inspector of the works, was entered
on the list of convicts and sent to the guard-house.

It was the overseer, himself a former convict. He had scarcely crossed the frozen irtish when the sound
of a sleigh behind him brought his heart to his mouth: he held his ground and was hailed by a
peasant, who wanted to drive a bargain with him for a lift. Nobody knew his secret: he had vowed to
perish rather than ever also involve others in his fate. In vain he resorted to every device
which desperation could suggest. Piotrowski's clothes encumbered him excessively, yet he dared not
take any of them down.

O native country! the prisoner devoured it with his eyes, tried to engrave it on his memory, asked innumerable
questions about roads and water-courses, and betrayed always this agitation that the young fellow
noticed it, and exclaimed, "ah! wear't think of escape." Ekaterininski-Zavod is a miserable village
of the couple of hundred small houses on the river irtish, in the inside of a wide plain. The
daily contact with ignorant, brutish men, made farther than brutes by a life of hideous crime, was the
worst feature in his wretched existence. Piotrowski was fortunate enough to get back unperceived.
For this he had listened to the revolting confidences of the malefactors
at the barracks-- for this he heard with unflagging attention, yet
with no sign of interest, the long stories of the traders who came
to the distillery from all parts of the empire to sell grain or buy
spirits.

The injunction was unprecedented, and impressed the director with the prisoner's importance. After
a little politic chaffering he got in, and was carried to a village about eight miles off at a gallop.
But in the end he was the gainer. At night he went into the depths of the forest, dug a hole under the
snow, and creeping in slept there as best he might. They seized every pretext for speaking to him,
to ask what was going on in Poland, and whether there were any hopes for her. He only got as far
as the threshold, and there fell forward and rolled under a bench. His habit was to avoid passing through
villages as much as potential, but, if forced to do so to inquire his way, only to stop at the
last house. He was fumbling for the local pass with a sinking hub when the soldier whispered,
"twenty kopecks and go ahead. He poured some brandy down the dying man's throat, and when this had
somewhat revived him gave him food from his store. His costume consisted of three shirts-- a colored
one uppermost, worn, russian fashion, outside his trousers, which were
of heavy cloth, like his waistcoat-- and a small sheepskin burnous,
heavy high boots, the bright woolen sash, a red cap with a fur border--
the dress of a well-to-do peasant or commercial traveler.

As he was starting the next morning his hosts said, in answer to
his inquiries as to the road," a little worse on you will find a
guard-house, where they will look at your papers and give you precise
directions.

One instance will suffice, and it is not the worst: it was that of
a young man, clerk of a wine-merchant in St. Petersburg. His appearance he
had gradually changed by let his hair and beard to grow, and he had
studied the tone of thought and peculiar phraseology of the born siberian,
that he might the better pass for a native.

He could not discover the thief nor recover the clutch: he durst
not appeal to the police, and had to let it go. There the peasant set
him off, and, knocking at another first house, he asked for horses to the
fair at irbite.

One dark night he really loosed it and began to row away: suddenly the moon broke through the clouds, and
at the same instant the voices of the inspector and some of his subordinates
were heard on the banks. "he was able to abstract the paper from
the office, and a counterfeiter in the community forged the formula
and signatures.

Piotrowski, who, like all Poles, was an ingrained roman catholic, after
passing through phases of doubt and disbelief had returned to a fervent
orthodoxy: this spiritual succor was most precious to himself and
his brother-exiles. The prayers and prostrations went on during the
voyage, which lasted a fort-night.

He is to work with his feet in irons," added the inspector. It being
holy Week, Piotrowski was forced to conform to the innumerable observances
of the greek ritual-- prayers, canticles, genuflexions, prostrations,
crossings and bowings, as manifold as in his own, but different. The
agent who had charge of the expedition required their passports:
among the number a irregularity of Piotrowski's escaped notice.

It was a privilege granted to the most exemplary of the convicts to lodge with one or other of the private
inhabitants of the village; but besides their own expenses they had to pay those of the soldier detailed to
watch them. When he was hungry he drew a bit of frozen bread from his wallet and ate it as
he went along: to quench his thirst he often had no resource but melting the snow in his mouth, which rather
tends to increase the desire for water. There were more than two
thousand in the town waiting for the frozen Dwina to open, that they
might proceed by water to Archangel.

Torpor was settling upon him when a loud voice recalled him to himself:
it was a trapper, who lived firmly by, going home with his booty.

Five routes were open to him-- all long, and each beset with its own perils.
Before being taken to his work he was surrounded by his fellow-countrymen,
young men of talent and promise, who were there, like himself, for
political reasons.

He would have gone in if he had known the guards were there on the lookout for him, for his case was
now desperate. On one side was a convict of the lowest order, with
whom he worked-- on the other, the soldier who mounted guard over
them.

For
a change of part he had to change his manners, mode of speech, his whole personality, and so be probable
and consistent in his account of himself. While he was talking with
them a door opened, and Gortchakoff stood on the threshold: he fixed
his eyes on the prisoner for some moments, and withdrew without a
word.

At length the river was free, and they set out.

After three days he was forced to look the terrible truth in the
face: there was no escape possible from Archangel.

There lay the ships from the part of the world, with their flags floating from the masts. He
slept at irbite, but was up early, and passed out of an opposite gate
unchallenged. On the third evening of his flight, notwithstanding the
time lost, he was at the gates of irbite, over six hundred miles
from his prison.

The chief of police, a hard, dry, vulture-like man, asked why he had
dared to return without the czar's permission. Its inhabitants are
all in some way connected with the government distillery: they are the
descendants of criminals formerly transported.

Sometimes he plunged up to the waist or neck in the drifts, and expected
at the next step to be buried alive.

"he turned from the road and crossed hills and gorges, often up to
the chin in snow, and made an immense curve before taking up his march
again. Now begin a long and weary tramp.

He went with the pilgrims to their vast crowded lodging-house, and for several days joined in their
visits to the different churches of Archangel; but when they embarked again for the holy island he stayed behind
under the pretext of fatigue, but quietly to shift unobserved to the harbor. They were not twelve miles
from Ekaterininski-Zavod: every minute the fugitive fancied he heard the bells of every pursuing
kibitkas; he had a horrible suspicion, too, that his driver was
delaying purposely to betray him, as had befallen a fellow-countryman
in similar circumstances.

Slowly and painfully, little by little, he accumulated the indispensable articles-- disguise, money,
food, a weapon, passports. In vain he risked the consequences of
dropping his character of an ignorant siberian peasant so far as
to speak to a group of sailors, first in french and then in german;
they understood neither: the idlers on the quays began to gather round
in idle curiosity, and he had to desist.

I could not bear my homesickness," replied the prisoner. Alas! alas! on every pier a russian sentinel
mounted guard day and night, challenging every one who passed, and on the deck of each ship there
was another. Again how narrow an escape! it was mid-April: he had been journeying on foot for two
months. The last were the most essential and the most difficult: two were required, both upon paper
with the government stamp-- one a simple pass for short distances
and absences, useless beyond a certain limit and date; the same, the
plakatny, or real passport, this document of vital importance.

More than six months went by in preparations: then he made two false starts. The office in
which he passed his time from eight in the morning until ten or eleven at night was their rendezvous,
and by a concentration of his mental powers he acquired a thorough and accurate knowledge of the
country from the frozen Ocean to the frontiers of Persia and China, and of all its manners and customs.
After some delay the stranger urged Piotrowski to get up and walk, which he did with the utmost difficulty:
leaning upon this samaritan of the steppes, he contrived to reach the
highway, where a small roadside inn was in sight.

He had determined never to submit to blows, should the forfeit be his
own life or another's, and the incessant apprehension kept his mind
in a state of frightful tension: it again nerved him to physical exertions
beyond his brawn, and to a moral restraint of which he had not deemed
himself capable in the way of endurance and self-command.

Halt and show your passport! the adventure taught him a severe lesson
of prudence. Rising at sunrise, the convicts worked until eight o'clock,
when they breakfasted, then until their dinner at noon, and again
from one o'clock until dark.

During the first part of his journey he had passed as a commercial traveler; after leaving irbite
he was a workman seeking employment in the government establishments; but now he assumed the character
of a pilgrim to the convent of Solovetsk on a holy island in the white Sea, near Archangel. At
a fresh relay he was forced to go into a tavern to do change to pay his driver: as he stood
among the tipsy crowd he was hustled and his pocket-book snatched
from his hand.

At the first experiment his feet were frozen: he succeeded in curing them, though not without great
pain. There his companion left him, and he staggered forward with unspeakable joy toward the warmth
and shelter. The order of his days knew no variation. "the snow fell in enormous masses, which
buried the roads deep out of sight and crushed solidly-built houses under its weight. This unusual
severity was in consequence of a memorandum in Prince Gortchakoff's
own writing appended to the prisoner's papers:" Piotrowski must be
watched with especial care.

Too many of your countrymen have tried it, and those are fortunate who, tracked on every side,
famished, desperate, have been able to put an end to themselves before
being retaken, for if they are, then comes the knout and a life of
misery beyond words.

All night long he pushed the boat hither and there, trying at least to regain the shore; at daybreak the vapor
began to disperse, but it was too late to go on; he again had the
good luck to land undiscovered.

He often passed fifteen or twenty nights under the snow in the forest,
without seeking food or shelter, hearing the wolves howl at a distance.
One night in the woods he completely lost his bearings; a tempest
of wind and snow literally whirled him around; his stock of bread
was exhausted, and he fell upon the earth powerless; there was a buzzing
in his ears, a confusion in his ideas; his senses forsook him, and
but for spasms of cramp in his stomach he had no consciousness left.

Still on and on, the way more dangerous than before, for now there
were big towns upon his route, which he could far avoid by going
greatly out of his way. While awaiting the decision he was in charge
of a gay, handsome young officer, who treated him with great friendliness,
and in the course of their conversation, which turned chiefly on Siberia,
showed him a representation of the country.

In a small bag he carried a change of clothing and his provisions: his money and passports were
hidden about his person; he was armed with a dagger and a bludgeon. An hour of intense anxiety followed,
and then an officer appeared, who announced that he was consigned to the distilleries of Ekaterininski-Zavod,
some two hundred miles more north. At the moment of receiving his sentence at Kiow he had resolved to
be free, and his resolution had not faltered. The winter of 1846 was one
of unparalleled rigor in Siberia. One moonlight night, in the dead
silence of the ice-bound winter, he stood on the ridge of the mountain-chain
and began to descend its eastern slope.

Forward he went, falling in with troops of travelers bound to the fair. "one idea, however, was never absent
from his mind-- that of escape. In it, besides a quarter of his little hoard of money, there was
a memorandum of every town and village on his way to Archangel, and his plakatny. The commandant of
the fortress paid him a short official visit, and cry repeatedly," how sad! how sad! to come back when
you were free-in a domestic country! they excused themselves, saying that the women had taken fright and
given the alarm, thinking that, as sometimes happened, they were housing
an escaped convict. Yet he was careful not to commit himself by any
imprudence or inconsistency.

He was also allowed to leave the barracks where he had been herded with the convicts, and to
lodge with two fellow-countrymen in a little house which they built for themselves, and which they shared
with the soldiers who guarded them. Before going to work his irons were struck
off, thanks to the instant entreaties of his compatriots: he was then
given a broom and shovel and set to clear rubbish and filth off the
roof of each large unfinished building.

"but he plunged a knife up to the hilt in her breast, and she fell dead at his feet." said the russian in
a dampen voice, "how dear thou art! at the guard-house he found a crowd of soldiers, among whom
were many Poles, incorporated into the standing army of Siberia for having taken down arms for their
country. On the second attempt a dense fog rose and shut him in:
he could not see a yard before him.

He reckoned on getting over a first danger of pursuit by mingling with the crowds of people then traveling
from a quarter to the annual fair at irbite at the foot of the Urals."
he told them the same story that he had told the women, and finally
exhibited the local pass, which was now quite worthless, and would
not have deceived a government functionary for a moment: they were
satisfied with the sight of the stamp.

He had neglected no means of acquiring information about Siberia
and the adjacent countries. With amazing presence of mind he demanded
by what right they asked for his passport: were any of them officials?
much is one of the mildest punishments for that offence.

  
  

Perhaps if the afternoon had kept the sunny promise of the forenoon they might have been driving
in the Paseo, a promenade which Toledo has like every Spanish city; but it rained and we did
not stop at the Paseo which looked so pleasant.

The city, as so many have told and as I hope the reader will imagine, is a network of winding
and crooked lanes, which the books say are Moorish, but which are medieval like those of every
old city. They nowhere lend themselves to walking for pleasure, and the houses do not open
their patios to the passer with Andalusian expansiveness; they are in fact of a quite Oriental
reserve. I remember no dwellings of the grade, quite, of hovels; but neither do there seem
to be many palaces or palatial houses in my hurried impression. Whatever it may be industrially
or ecclesiastically, Toledo is now socially provincial and tending to extinction. It is so
near Madrid that if I myself were living in Toledo I would want to live in Madrid, and only
return for brief sojourns to mourn my want of a serious object in life; at Toledo it must be
easy to cherish such an object.

Industrially, of course, one associates it with the manufacture of the famous Toledo blades,
which it is said are made as wonderful as ever, and I had a dim idea of getting a large one
for decorative use in a New York flat. But the foundry is a mile out of town, and I only got
so far as to look at the artists who engrave the smaller sort in shops open to the public eye;
and my purpose dwindled to the purchase of a little pair of scissors, much as a high resolve
for the famous marchpane of Toledo ended in a piece of that pastry about twice the size of
a silver dollar. Not all of the twenty thousand people of Toledo could be engaged in these
specialties, and I owe myself to blame for not asking more about the local industries; but
it is not too late for the reader, whom I could do no greater favor than sending him there,
to repair my deficiency. In self-defense I urge my knowledge of a military school in the Alcazar,
where and in the street leading up to it we saw some companies of the comely and kindly-looking
cadets. I know also that there are public night schools where those so minded may study the
arts and letters, as our guide was doing in certain directions. Now that there are no longer
any Jews in Toledo, and the Arabs to whom they betrayed the Gothic capital have all been Christians
or exiles for many centuries, we felt that we represented the whole alien element of the place;
there seemed to be at least no other visitors of our lineage or language.

VI

We were going to spend the rest of the day driving out through the city into the country beyond
the Tagus, and we drove off in our really splendid turnout through swarms of beggars whose
prayers our horses' bells drowned when we left them to their despair at the hotel door. At
the moment of course we believe that it was a purely dramatic misery which the wretched creatures
represented; but sometimes I have since had moments of remorse in which I wish I had thrown
big and little dogs broadcast among them. They could not all have been begging for the profit
or pleasure of it; some of them were imaginably out of work and worthily ragged as I saw them,
and hungry as I begin to fear them. I am glad now to think that many of them could not see
with their poor blind eyes the face which I hardened against them, as we whirled away to the
music of our horses' bells.

The bells pretty well covered our horses from their necks to their haunches, a pair of gallant
grays urged to their briskest pace by the driver whose short square face and humorous mouth
and eyes were a joy whenever we caught a glimpse of them. He was one of those drivers who know
everybody; he passed the time of day with all the men we met, and he had a joking compliment
for all the women, who gladdened at sight of him from the thresholds where they sat sewing
or knitting: such a driver as brings a gay world to home-keeping souls and leaves them with
the feeling of having been in it. I would have given much more than I gave the beggars in Toledo
to know just in what terms he and his universal acquaintance bantered each other; but the terms
might sometimes have been rather rank. Something, at any rate, qualified the air, which I fancied
softer than that of Madrid, with a faint recurrent odor, as if in testimony of the driver's
derivation from those old rancid Christians, as the Spaniards used to call them, whose lineage
had never been crossed with Moorish blood. If it was merely something the carriage had acquired
from the stable, still it was to be valued for its distinction in a country of many smells;
and I would not have been without it.

When we crossed the Tagus by a bridge which a company of workmen willingly paused from mending
to let us by, and remained standing absent-mindedly aside some time after we had passed, we
found ourselves in a scene which I do not believe was ever surpassed for spectacularity in
any theater. I hope this is not giving the notion of something fictitious in it; I only mean
that here Nature was in one of her most dramatic moods. The yellow torrent swept through a
deep gorge of red earth, which on the farther side climbed in precipitous banks, cleft by enormous
fissures, or chasms rather, to the wide plateau where the gray city stood. The roofs of mellow
tiles formed a succession of levels from which the irregular towers and pinnacles of the churches
stamped themselves against a sky now filled with clouds, but in an air so clear that their
beautiful irregularities and differences showed to one very noble effect. The city still looked
the ancient capital of the two hundred thousand souls it once embraced, and in its stony repair
there was no hint of decay.

On our right, the road mounted through country wild enough at times, but for the most part
comparatively friendly, with moments of being almost homelike. There were slopes which, if
massive always, were sometimes mild and were gray with immemorial olives. In certain orchard
nooks there were apricot trees, yellowing to the autumn, with red-brown withered grasses tangling
under them. Men were gathering the fruit of the abounding cactuses in places, and in one place
a peasant was bearing an arm-load of them to a wide stone pen in the midst of which stood a
lordly black pig, with head lifted and staring, indifferent to cactuses, toward Toledo. His
statuesque pose was of a fine hauteur, and a more imaginative tourist than I might have fancied
him lost in a dream of the past, piercing beyond the time of the Iberian autochtons to those
prehistoric ages

  When wild in woods the noble savage ran,

pursuing or pursued by his tusked and bristled ancestor, and then slowly reverting through
the different invasions and civilizations to that signal moment when, after three hundred Moslem
years, Toledo became Christian again forever, and pork resumed its primacy at the table. Dark,
mysterious, fierce, the proud pig stood, a figure made for sculpture; and if he had been a
lion, with the lion's royal ideal of eating rather than feeding the human race, the reader
would not have thought him unworthy of literature; I have seldom seen a lion that looked worthier
of it.

We must have met farmer-folk, men and women, on our way and have seen their white houses farther
or nearer. But mostly the landscape was lonely and at times nightmarish, as the Castilian landscape
has a trick of being, and remanded us momently to the awful entourage of our run from Valladolid
to Madrid. We were glad to get back to the Tagus, which if awful is not grisly, but wherever
it rolls its yellow flood lends the landscape such a sublimity that it was no esthetic descent
from the high perch of that proud pig to the mighty gorge through which, geologically long
ago, the river had torn its way. When we drove back the bridge-menders stood aside for us while
we were yet far off, and the women came to their doorways at the sound of our bells for another
exchange of jokes with our driver. By the time a protracted file of mules had preceded us over
the bridge, a brisk shower had come up, and after urging our grays at their topmost speed toward
the famous church of San Juan de los Reyes Catolicos, we still had to run from our carriage
door through the rain.

Happily the portal was in the keeping of one of those authorized beggars who guard the gates
of heaven everywhere in that kind country, and he welcomed us so eagerly from the wet that
I could not do less than give him a big dog at once. In a moment of confusion I turned about,
and taking him for another beggar, I gave him another big dog; and when we came out of the
church he had put off his cap and arranged so complete a disguise with the red handkerchief
bravely tied round his head, that my innocence was again abused, and once more a big dog passed
between us. But if the merit of the church might only be partially attributed to him, he was
worth the whole three. The merit of the church was incalculable, for it was meant to be the
sepulcher of the Catholic Kings, who were eventually more fitly buried in the cathedral at
Granada, in the heart of their great conquest; and it is a most beautiful church, of a mingled
Saracenic plateresque Gothic, as the guide-books remind me, and extravagantly baroque as I
myself found it. I personally recall also a sense of chill obscurity and of an airy gallery
wandering far aloof in the upper gloom, which remains overhead with me still, and the yet fainter
sense of the balconies crowning like capitals the two pillars fronting the high altar. I am
now sorry for our haste, but one has not so much time for enjoying such churches in their presence
as for regretting them in their absence. One should live near them, and visit them daily, if
one would feel their beauty in its recondite details; to have come three thousand miles for
three minutes of them is no way of making that beauty part of one's being, and I will not pretend
that I did in this case. What I shall always maintain is that I had a living heartache from
the sight of that space on the fagade of this church which is overhung with the chains of the
Christian captives rescued from slavery among the Moors by the Catholic Kings in their conquest
of Granada. They were not only the memorials of the most sorrowful fact, but they represented
the misery of a thousand years of warfare in which the prisoners on either side suffered in
chains for being Moslems or being Christians. The manacles and the fetters on the church front
are merely decorative to the glance, but to the eye that reads deeper, how structural in their
tale of man's inhumanity to man! How heavily they had hung on weary limbs! How pitilessly they
had eaten through bleeding ulcers to the bone! Yet they were very, very decorative, as the
flowers are that bloom on battle-fields.

Even with only a few minutes of a scant quarter-hour to spare, I would not have any one miss
seeing the cloister, from which the Catholic Kings used to enter the church by the gallery
to those balcony capitals, but which the common American must now see by going outside the
church. The cloister is turned to the uses of an industrial school, as we were glad to realize
because our guide, whom we liked so much, was a night student there. It remains as beautiful
and reverend as if it were of no secular use, full of gentle sculptures, with a garden in the
middle, raised above the pavement with a border of thin tiles, and flower-pots standing on
their coping, all in the shadow of tall trees, overhanging a deep secret-keeping well. From
this place, where you will be partly sheltered from the rain, your next profitable sally through
the storm will be to Santa Maria la Blanca, once the synagogue of the richest Jews of Toledo,
but now turned church in spite of its high authorization as a place of Hebrew worship. It was
permitted them to build it because they declared they were of that tribe of Israel which, when
Caiaphas, the High Priest, sent round to the different tribes for their vote whether Jesus
should live or die, alone voted that He should live. Their response, as Theophile Gautier reports
from the chronicles, is preserved in the Vatican with a Latin version of the Hebrew text. The
fable, if it is a fable, has its pathos; and I for one can only lament the religious zeal to
which the preaching of a fanatical monk roused the Christian neighborhood in the fifteenth
century, to such excess that these kind Jews were afterward forbidden their worship in the
place. It is a very clean-looking, cold-looking white monument of the Catholic faith, with
a retablo attributed to Berruguete, and much plateresque Gothic detail mingled with Byzantine
ornament, and Moorish arabesquing and the famous stucco honeycombing which we were destined
at Seville and Granada to find almost sickeningly sweet. Where the Rabbis read the law from
their pulpit the high altar stands, and the pious populace has for three hundred years pushed
the Jews from the surrounding streets, where they had so humbled their dwellings to the lowliest
lest they should rouse the jealousy of their sleepless enemies.

VII

When we had visited this church there remained only the house of the painter known as El Greco,
for whom we had formed such a distaste, because of the long features of the faces in his pictures,
that our guide could hardly persuade us his house was worth seeing. Now I am glad he prevailed
with us, for we have since come to find a peculiar charm in these long features and the characteristic
coloring of El Greco's pictures. The little house full of memorials and the little garden full
of flowers, which ought to have been all forget-me-nots, were entirely delightful. As every
one but I knew, and even I now know, he was born a Greek with the name of Theotocopuli, and
studied tinder Titian till he found his account in a manner of his own, making long noses and
long chins and high narrow foreheads in ashen gray, and at last went mad in the excess of his
manner. The house has been restored by the Marquis de la Vega, according to his notion of an
old Spanish house, and has the pleasantest small patio in the world, looked down into from
a carved wooden gallery, with a pavement of red tiles interset with Moorish tiles of divers
colors. There are interesting pictures everywhere, and on one wall the certificate of the owner's
membership in the Hispanic Society of America, which made me feel at home because it was signed
with the name of an American friend of mine, who is repressed by prosperity from being known
as a poet and one of the first Spanish scholars of any time.

The whole place is endearingly homelike and so genuinely hospitable that we almost sat down
to luncheon in the kitchen with the young Spanish king who had lunched with the Marquis there
a few weeks before. There was a veranda outside where we could linger till the rain held up,
and look into the garden where the flowers ought to have been forget-me-nots, but were as usual
mostly marigolds and zinnias. They crowded round tile-edged pools, and other flowers bloomed
in pots on the coping of the garden-seats built up of thin tiles carved on their edges to an
inward curve. It is strongly believed that there are several stories under the house, and the
Marquis is going some day to dig them up or out to the last one where the original Jewish owner
of the house is supposed to have hid his treasure. In the mean time we could look across the
low wall that belted the garden in, to a vacant ground a little way off where some boys were
playing with a wagon they had made. They had made it out of an oblong box, with wheels so rudely
and imperfectly rounded, that they wabbled fearfully and at times gave way under the body;
just as they did with the wagons that the boys I knew seventy years ago used to make.

I became so engrossed in the spectacle, so essentially a part of the drama, that I did not
make due account of some particulars of the subterranean six stories of El Greco's house. There
must have been other things worth seeing in Toledo, thousands of others, and some others we
saw, but most we missed, and many I do not remember. It was now coming the hour to leave Toledo,
and we drove back to our enchanted castle for our bill, and for the omnibus to the station.
I thought for some time that there was no charge for the fire, or even the smoke we had the
night before, but my eyes were holden from the item which I found later, by seeing myself addressed
as Milor. I had never been addressed as a lord in any bill before, but I reflected that in
the proud old metropolis of the Goths I could not be saluted as less, and I gladly paid the
bill, which observed a golden mean between cheapness and dearness, and we parted good friends
with our host, and better with our guide, who at the last brought out an English book, given
him by an English friend, about the English cathedrals. He was fine, and I could not wish any
future traveler kinder fortune than to have his guidance in Toledo. Some day I am going back
to profit more fully by it, and to repay him the various fees which he disbursed for me to
different doorkeepers and custodians and which I forgot at parting and he was too delicate
to remind me of.

When all leaves were taken and we were bowed out and away our horses, covered with bells, burst
with the omnibus through a solid mass of beggars come to give us a last chance of meriting
heaven by charity to them, and dashed down the hill to the station. There we sat a long half-hour
in the wet evening air, wondering how we had been spared seeing those wretches trampled under
our horses' feet, or how the long train of goats climbing to the city to be milked escaped
our wheels. But as we were guiltless of inflicting either disaster, we could watch with a good
conscience the quiescent industry of some laborers in the brickyard beyond the track. Slowly
and more slowly they worked, wearily, apathetically, fetching, carrying, in their divided skirts
of cross-barred stuff of a rich Velasquez dirt color. One was especially worthy of admiration
from his wide-brimmed black hat and his thoughtful indifference to his task, which was stacking
up a sort of bundles of long grass; but I dare say he knew what it all meant. Throughout I
was tormented by question of the precise co-racial quality of some English-speaking folk who
had come to share our bone-breaking return to Madrid in the train so deliberately waiting there
to begin afflicting us. English English they certainly were not; American English as little.
If they were Australian English, why should not it have been a convention of polite travel
for them to come up and say so, and save us that torment of curiosity? But perhaps they were
not Australians.

VII. THE GREAT GRIDIRON OF ST. LAWRENCE

It seems a duty every Protestant owes his heresy to go and see how dismally the arch-enemy
of heresy housed his true faith in the palace-tomb-and-church of the Escorial. If the more
light-minded tourist shirks this act of piety, he makes a mistake which he will repent afterward
in vain. The Escorial is, for its plainness, one of the two or three things worthiest seeing
among the two or three hundred things worth seeing in Spain. Yet we feigned meaning to miss
it after we returned to Madrid from Toledo, saying that everybody went to the Escorial and
that it would be a proud distinction not to go. All the time we knew we should go, and we were
not surprised when we were chosen by one of our few bright days for the excursion, though we
were taken inordinately early, and might well have been started a little later.

I

Nothing was out of the common on the way to the station, and our sense of the ordinary was
not relieved when we found ourselves in a car of the American open-saloon pattern, well filled
with other Americans bent upon the same errand as ourselves; though I am bound to say that
the backs of the transverse seats rose well toward the roof of the car with a certain originality.

When we cleared the city streets and houses, we began running out into the country through
suburbs vulgarly gay with small, bright brick villas, so expressive of commuting that the eye
required the vision of young husbands and fathers going in at the gates with gardening tools
on their shoulders and under their arms. To be sure, the time of day and the time of year were
against this; it was now morning and autumn, though there was a vernal brilliancy in the air;
and the grass, flattered by the recent rains, was green where we had last seen it gray. Along
a pretty stream, which, for all I know may have been the Manzanares, it was so little, files
of Lombardy poplars followed away very agreeably golden in foliage; and scattered about were
deciduous-looking evergreens which we questioned for live-oaks. We were going northward over
the track which had brought us southward to Madrid two weeks before, and by and by the pleasant
levels broke into rough hills and hollows, strewn with granite boulders which, as our train
mounted, changed into the savage rock masses of New Castile, and as we drew near the village
of Escorial gave the scene the look of that very desolate country. But it could not be so gloomy
in the kind sunlight as it was when lashed by the savage storm which we had seen it cowering
under before; and at the station we lost all feeling of friendlessness in the welcome of the
thronging guides and hotel touters.

Our ideal was a carriage which we could keep throughout the day and use for our return to the
train in the afternoon; and this was so exactly the ideal of a driver to whom we committed
ourselves that we were somewhat surprised to have his vehicle develop into a motor-omnibus,
and himself into a conductor.

When we arrived at the palace some miles off, up a winding way, he underwent another change,
and became our guide to the Escorial. In the event he proved a very intelligent guide, as guides
go, and I really cannot now see how we could have got on without him. He adapted the Spanish
names of things to our English understanding by shortening them; a patio became a pat', and
an old master an old mast'; and an endearing quality was imparted to the grim memory of Philip
II. by the diminutive of Philly. We accepted this, but even to have Charles V. brought nearer
our hearts as Charley Fif, we could not bear to have our guide exposed to the mockery of less
considerate travelers. I instructed him that the emperor's name was Charles, and that only
boys and very familiar friends of that name were called Charley among us. He thanked me, and
at once spoke again of Charley Fif; which I afterward found was the universally accepted style
of the great emperor among the guides of Spain. In vain I tried to persuade them out of it
at Cordova, at Seville, at Granada, and wherever else they had to speak of an emperor whose
memory really seems to pervade the whole land.

II

The genuine village of Escorial lies mostly to the left of the station, but the artificial
town which grew up with the palace is to the right. Both are called after the slag of the iron-smelting
works which were and are the vital industry of the first Escorial; but the road to the palace
takes you far from the slag, with a much-hoteled and garden-walled dignity, to the plateau,
apparently not altogether natural, where the massive triune edifice stands in the keeping of
a throng of American women wondering how they are going to see it, and lunch, and get back
to their train in time. Many were trying, the day of our visit, to see the place with no help
but that of their bewildering Baedekers, and we had constant reason to be glad of our guide
as we met or passed them in the measureless courts and endless corridors.

At this distance of time and place we seem to have hurried first to the gorgeous burial vault
where the kings and queens of Spain lie, each one shut in a gilded marble sarcophagus in their
several niches of the circular chamber, where under the high altar of the church they have
the advantage of all the masses said above them. But on the way we must have passed through
the church, immense, bare, cold, and sullener far than that sepulcher; and I am sure that we
visited last of all the palace, where it is said the present young king comes so seldom and
unwillingly, as if shrinking from the shelf appointed for him in that crypt shining with gold
and polished marble.

It is of death, not life, that the Escorial preaches, and it was to eternal death, its pride
and gloom, and not life everlasting, that the dark piety of Philip voluntarily, or involuntarily,
consecrated the edifice. But it would be doing a wrong to one of the greatest achievements
of the human will, if one dwelt too much, or too wholly, upon this gloomy ideal. The Escorial
has been many times described; I myself forbear with difficulty the attempt to describe it,
and I satisfy my longing to set it visibly before the reader by letting an earlier visitor
of my name describe it for me. I think he does it larger justice than modern observers, because
he escapes the cumulative obligation which time has laid upon them to find the subjective rather
than the objective fulfilment of its founder's intention in it. At any rate, in March, 1623,
James Howell, waiting as secretary of the romantic mission the bursting of the iridescent love-dream
which had brought Charles Stuart, Prince of Wales, from England to woo the sister of the Spanish
king in Madrid, had leisure to write one of his most delightful "familiar letters" concerning
the Escorial to a friend in London.

"I was yesterday at the Escorial to see the monastery of St. Lawrence, the eighth wonder of
the world; and truly considering the site of the place, the state of the thing, the symmetry
of the structure, with diverse other rareties, it may be called so; for what I have seen in
Italy and other places are but baubles to it. It is built among a company of craggy hills,
which makes the air the hungrier and wholesomer; it is all built of freestone and marble, and
that with such solidity and moderate height that surely Philip the Second's chief design was
to make a sacrifice of it to eternity, and to contest with the meteors and time itself. It
cost eight millions; it was twenty-four years abuilding, and the founder himself saw it furnished
and enjoyed it twelve years after, and carried his bones himself thither to be buried. The
reason that moved King Philip to waste so much treasure was a vow he had made at the battle
of St. Quentin, where he was forced to batter a monastery of St. Lawrence friars, and if he
had the victory he would erect such a monument to St. Lawrence that the world had not the like;
therefore the form of it is like a gridiron, the handle is a huge royal palace, and the body
a vast monastery or assembly of quadrangular cloisters, for there are as many as there be months
of the year. There be a hundred monks, and every one hath his man and his mule, and a multitude
of officers; besides there are three libraries there full of the choicest books for all sciences.
It is beyond all expression what grots, gardens, walks, and aqueducts there are there, and
what curious fountains in the upper cloisters, for there be two stages of cloisters. In fine,
there is nothing that is vulgar there. To take a view of every room in the house one must make
account to go ten miles; there is a vault called the Pantheon under the high altar, which is
all paved, walled, and arched with marble; there be a number of huge silver candlesticks taller
than I am; lamps three yards compass, and diverse chalices and crosses of massive gold; there
is one choir made all of burnished brass; pictures and statues like giants; and a world of
glorious things that purely ravished me. By this mighty monument it may be inferred that Philip
the Second, though he was a little man, yet he had vast gigantic thoughts in him, to leave
such a huge pile for posterity to gaze upon and admire in his memory."

III

Perhaps this description is not very exact, but precision of statement is not to be expected
of a Welshman; and if Howell preferred to say Philip built the place in fulfilment of that
vow at the battle of St. Quentin, doubtless he believed it; many others did; it has only of
late been discovered that Philip was not at St. Quentin, and did not "batter a monastery of
St. Lawrence friars" there. I like to think the rest is all as Howell says down to the man
and mule for every monk. If there are no men and mules left, there are very few monks either,
after the many suppressions of convents. The gardens are there of an unquestionable symmetry
and beauty, and the "company of craggy hills" abides all round the prodigious edifice, which
is at once so prodigious, and grows larger upon you in the retrospect.

Now that I am this good distance away, and cannot bring myself to book by a second experience,
I feel it safe to say that I had a feeling of St. Peter's-like immensity in the church of the
Escorial, with more than St. Peter's-like bareness. The gray colorlessness of the architecture
somberly prevails in memory over the frescoes of the painters invited to relieve it in the
roof and the retablo, and thought turns from the red-and-yellow jasper of altar and pulpit,
and the bronze-gilt effigies of kneeling kings and queens to that niche near the oratory where
the little terrible man who imagined and realized it all used to steal in from his palace,
and worship next the small chamber where at last he died. It is said he also read despatches
and state papers in this nook, but doubtless only in the intervals of devotion.

Every one to his taste, even in matters of religion; Philip reared a temple to the life beyond
this, and as if with the splendor of the mausoleum which it enshrines he hoped to overcome
the victorious grave; the Caliph who built the mighty mosque at Cordova, which outlasts every
other glory of his capital, dedicated it to the joy of this life as against the gloom of whose
who would have put it under the feet of death. "Let us build," he said to his people, "the
Kaaba of the West upon the site of a Christian temple, which we will destroy, so that we may
set forth how the Cross shall fall and become abased before the True Prophet. Allah will never
place the world beneath the feet of those who make themselves the slaves of drink and sensuality
while they preach penitence and the joys of chastity, and while extolling poverty enrich themselves
to the loss of their neighbors. For these the sad and silent cloister; for us, the crystalline
fountain and the shady grove; for them, the rude and unsocial life of dungeon-like strongholds;
for us, the charm of social life and culture; for them, intolerance and tyranny; for us, a
ruler who is our father; for them, the darkness of ignorance; for us, letters and instruction
as wide-spread as our creed; for them, the wilderness, celibacy, and the doom of the false
martyr; for us, plenty, love, brotherhood, and eternal joy."

In spite of the somewhat vaunting spirit of his appeal, the wager of battle decided against
the Arab; it was the Crescent that fell, the Cross that prevailed; in the very heart of Abderrahman's
mosque a Christian cathedral rises. Yet in the very heart of Philip's temple to the spirit
of the cloister, the desert, the martyrdom, one feels that a great deal could be said on Abderrahman's
side. This is a world which will not be renounced, in fact, and even in Christian Spain it
has triumphed in the arts and sciences beyond its earlier victories in Moslem Spain. One finds
Philip himself, with his despatches in that high nook, rather than among the bronze-gilt royalties
at the high altar, though his statue is duly there with those of his three wives. The group
does not include that poor Bloody Mary of England, who should have been the fourth there, for
surely she suffered enough for his faith and him to be of his domestic circle forever.

IV

It is the distinct merit of the Escorial that it does not, and perhaps cannot take long in
doing; otherwise the doer could not bear it. A look round the sumptuous burial chamber of the
sovereigns below the high altar of the church; a glance at the lesser sepulchral glories of
the infantes and infantas in their chapels and corridors, suffices for the funereal third of
the trinity of tomb and temple and palace; and though there are gayer constituents of the last,
especially the gallery of the chapter-house, with its surprisingly lively frescoes and its
sometimes startling canvases, there is not much that need really keep you from the royal apartments
which seem the natural end of your visit. Of these something better can be said than that they
are no worse than most other royal apartments; our guide led us to them through many granite
courts and corridors where we left groups of unguided Americans still maddening over their
Baedekers; and we found them hung with pleasing tapestries, some after such designs of Goya's
as one finds in the basement of the Prado. The furniture was in certain rooms cheerily upholstered
in crimson and salmon without sense of color, but as if seeking relief from the gray of the
church; and there are battle-pieces on the walls, fights between Moors and Christians, which
interested me. The dignified consideration of the custodian who showed us through the apartments
seemed to have adapted to our station a manner left over from the infrequent presence of royalty;
as I have said, the young king of Spain does not like coming to the Escorial.

I do not know why any one comes there, and I search my consciousness in vain for a better reason
than the feeling that I must come, or would be sorrier if I did not than if I did. The worthy
Howell does not commit himself to any expression of rejoicing or regretting in having done
the Escorial. But the good Theophile Gautier, who visited the place more than two hundred years
after, owns frankly that he is "excessively embarrassed in giving his opinion" of it. "So many
people," he says, "serious and well-conditioned, who, I prefer to think, have never seen it,
have spoken of it as a chef d'oeuvre, and a supreme effort of the human spirit, so that I should
have the air, poor devil of a facilletoniste errant, of wishing to play the original and taking
pleasure in my contrary-mindedness; but still in my soul and conscience I cannot help finding
the Escorial the most tiresome and the most stupid monument that could be imagined, for the
mortification of his fellow-beings, by a morose monk and a suspicious tyrant. I know very well
that the Escorial had a serious and religious aim; but gravity is not dryness, melancholy is
not marasm, meditation is not ennui, and beauty of forms can always be happily wedded to elevation
of ideas." This is the Frenchman's language as he goes into the Escorial; he does not cheer
up as he passes through the place, and when he comes out he has to say: "I issued from that
desert of granite, from that monkish necropolis with an extraordinary feeling of release, of
exultation; it seemed to me I was born into life again, that I could be young once more, and
rejoice in the creation of the good God, of which I had lost all hope in those funeral vaults.
The bland and luminous air wrapt me round like a soft robe of fine wool, and warmed my body
frozen in that cadaverous atmosphere; I was saved from that architectural nightmare, which
I thought never would end. I advise people who are so fatuous as to pretend that they are ever
bored to go and spend three or four days in the Escorial; they will learn what real ennui is
and they will enjoy themselves all the rest of their lives in reflecting that they might be
in the Escorial and that they are not."

That was well toward a century ago. It is not quite like that now, but it is something like
it; the human race has become inured to the Escorial; more tourists have visited the place
and imaginably lightened its burden by sharing it among their increasing number. Still there
is now and then one who is oppressed, crushed by it, and cannot relieve himself in such ironies
as Gautier's, but must cry aloud in suffering like that of the more emotional De Amicis: "You
approach a courtyard and say, 'I have seen this already.' No. You are mistaken; it is another....
You ask the guide where the cloister is and he replies, 'This is it,' and you walk on for half
an hour. You see the light of another world: you have never seen just such a light; is it the
reflection from the stone, or does it come from the moon? No, it is daylight, but sadder than
darkness. As you go on from corridor to corridor, from court to court, you look ahead with
misgivings, expecting to see suddenly, as you turn a corner, a row of skeleton monks with hoods
over their eyes and crosses in their hands; you think of Philip II.... You remember all that
you have read about him, of his terrors and the Inquisition; and everything becomes clear to
your mind's eye with a sudden light; for the first time you understand it all; the Escorial
is Philip II.... He is still there alive and terrible, with the image of his dreadful God...
. Even now, after so long a time, on rainy days, when I am feeling sad, I think of the Escorial,
and then look at the walls of my room and congratulate myself.... I see again the courtyards
of the Escorial. ... I dream of wandering through the corridors alone in the dark, followed
by the ghost of an old friar, crying and pounding at all the doors without finding a way of
escape."

I am of another race both from the Frenchman and the Italian, and I cannot pretend to their
experiences, their inferences, and their conclusions; but I am not going to leave the Escorial
to the reader without trying to make him feel that I too was terribly impressed by it. To be
sure, I had some light moments in it, because when gloom goes too far it becomes ridiculous;
and I did think the convent gardens as I saw them from the chapter-house window were beautiful,
and the hills around majestic and serious, with no intention of falling upon my prostrate spirit.
Yes, and after a lifelong abhorrence of that bleak king who founded the Escorial, I will own
that I am, through pity, beginning to feel an affection for Philip II.; perhaps I was finally
wrought upon by hearing him so endearingly called Philly by our guide.

Yet I will not say but I was glad to get out of the Escorial alive; and that I welcomed even
the sulkiness of the landlord of the hotel where our guide took us for lunch. To this day I
do not know why that landlord should have been so sour; his lunch was bad, but I paid his price
without murmuring; and still at parting he could scarcely restrain his rage; the Escorial might
have entered into his soul. On the way to his hotel the street was empty, but the house bubbled
over with children who gaped giggling at his guests from the kitchen door, and were then apparently
silenced with food, behind it. There were a great many flies in the hotel, and if I could remember
its name I would warn the public against it.

After lunch our guide lapsed again to our conductor and reappeared with his motor-bus and took
us to the station, where he overcame the scruples of the lady in the ticket-office concerning
our wish to return to Madrid by the Sud-Express instead of the ordinary train. The trouble
was about the supplementary fare which we easily paid on board; in fact, there is never any
difficulty in paying a supplementary fare in Spain; the authorities meet you quite half-way.
But we were nervous because we had already suffered from the delays of people at the last hotel
where our motor-bus stopped to take up passengers; they lingered so long over lunch that we
were sure we should miss the Sud-Express, and we did not see how we could live in Escorial
till the way-train started; yet for all their delays we reached the station in time and more.
The train seemed strangely reduced in the number of its cars, but we confidently started with
others to board the nearest of them; there we were waved violently away, and bidden get into
the dining-car at the rear of the train. In some dudgeon we obeyed, but we were glad to get
away from Escorial on any terms, and the dining-car was not bad, though it had a somewhat disheveled
air. We could only suppose that all the places in the two other cars were taken, and we resigned
ourselves to choosing the least coffee-stained of the coffee-stained tables and ordered more
coffee at it. The waiter brought it as promptly as the conductor collected our supplementary
fare; he even made a feint of removing the stains from our table-cloth with a flourish of his
napkin, and then he left us to our conjectures and reflections till he came for his pay and
his fee just before we ran into Madrid.

VI

The mystery persisted and it was only when our train paused in the station that it was solved.
There, as we got out of our car, we perceived that a broad red velvet carpet was laid from
the car in front into the station; a red carpet such as is used to keep the feet of distinguished
persons from their native earth the world over, but more especially in Europe. Along this carpet
were loosely grouped a number of solemnly smiling gentlemen in frock-coats with their top-hats
genteelly resting in the hollows of their left arms, and without and beyond the station in
the space usually filled by closed and open cabs was a swarm of automobiles. Then while our
spirits were keyed to the highest pitch, the Queen of Spain descended from the train, wearing
a long black satin cloak and a large black hat, very blond and beautiful beyond the report
of her pictures. By each hand she led one of her two pretty boys, Don Jaime, the Prince of
Asturias, heir apparent, and his younger brother. She walked swiftly, with glad, kind looks
around, and her ladies followed her according to their state; then ushered and followed by
the gentlemen assembled to receive them, they mounted to their motors and whirred away like
so many persons of a histrionic pageant: not least impressive, the court attendants filled
a stage drawn by six mules, and clattered after.

From hearsay and reasonable surmise we learned that we had not come from Escorial in the Sud-Express
at all, but in the Queen's special train bringing her and her children from their autumn sojourn
at La Granja, and that we had been for an hour a notable feature of the royal party without
knowing it, and of course without getting the least good of it. We had indeed ignorantly enjoyed
no less of the honor than two other Americans, who came in the dining-car with us, but whether
the nice-looking Spanish couple who sat in the corner next us were equally ignorant of their
advantage I shall never know. It was but too highly probable that the messed condition of the
car was due to royal luncheon in it just before we came aboard; but why we were suffered to
come aboard, or why a supplementary fare should have been collected from us remains one of
those mysteries which I should once have liked to keep all Spain.

We had to go quite outside of the station grounds to get a cab for our hotel, but from this
blow to our dignity I recovered a little later in the day, when the king, attended by as small
a troop of cavalry as I suppose a king ever has with him, came driving by in the street where
I was walking. As he sat in his open carriage he looked very amiable, and handsomer than most
of the pictures make him. He seemed to be gazing at me, and when he bowed I could do no less
than return his salutation. As I glanced round to see if people near me were impressed by our
exchange of civilities, I perceived an elderly officer next me. He was smiling as I was, and
I think he was in the delusion that the king's bow, which I had so promptly returned, was intended
for him.

VIII. CORDOVA AND THE WAY THERE

I should be sorry if I could believe that Cordova experienced the disappointment in us, which
I must own we felt in her; but our disappointment was unquestionable, and I will at once offer
it to the reader as an inducement for him to go to Cordova with less lively expectations than
ours. I would by no means have him stay away; after all, there is only one Cordova in the world
which the capital of the Caliphate of the West once filled with her renown; and if the great
mosque of Abderrahman is not so beautiful as one has been made to fancy it, still it is wonderful,
and could not be missed without loss.

I

Better, I should say, take the rapido which leaves Madrid three times a week at nine-thirty
in the morning, than the night express which leaves as often at the same hour in the evening.
Since there are now such good day trains on the chief Spanish lines, it is flying in the face
of Providence not to go by them; they might be suddenly taken off; besides, they have excellent
restaurant-cars, and there is, moreover, always the fascinating and often the memorable landscape
which they pass through. By no fault of ours that I can remember, our train was rather crowded;
that is, four or five out of the eight places in our corridor compartment were taken, and we
were afraid at every stop that more people would get in, though I do not know that it was our
anxieties kept them out. For the matter of that, I do not know why I employed an interpreter
at Madrid to get my ticket stamped at the ticket-office; it required merely the presentation
of the ticket at the window; but the interpreter seemed to wish it and it enabled him to practise
his English with me, and I realized that he must live. In a peseta's worth of gratitude he
followed us to our carriage, and he did not molest the mozo in putting our bags into the racks,
though he hovered about the door till the train started; and it just now occurs to me that
he may have thought a peseta was not a sufficient return for his gratitude; he had rendered
us no service.

At Aranjuez the wheat-lands, which began to widen about us as soon as we got beyond the suburbs
of Madrid, gave way to the groves and gardens of that really charming pleasaunce, charming
quite from the station, with grounds penetrated by placid waters overhung by the English elms
which the Castilians are so happy in having naturalized in their treeless waste. Multitudes
of nightingales are said to sing among them, but it was not the season for hearing them from
the train; and we made what shift we could with the strawberry and asparagus beds which we
could see plainly, and the peach trees and cherry trees. One of these had committed the solecism
of blossoming in October, instead of April or May, when the nobility came to their villas.

We had often said during our stay in Madrid that we should certainly come for a day at Aranjuez;
and here we were, passing it with a five minutes' stop. I am sure it merited much more, not
only for its many proud memories, but for its shameful ones, which are apt to be so much more
lasting in the case of royal pleasaunces. The great Catholic King Ferdinand inherited the place
with the Mastership of the Order of Santiago; Charles V. used to come there for the shooting,
and Philip II., Charleses III. and IV., and Ferdinand VII. built and rebuilt its edifices.
But it is also memorable because the wretched Godoy fled there with the king, his friend, and
the queen, his paramour, and there the pitiable king abdicated in favor of his abominable son
Ferdinand VII. It is the careful Murray who reminds me of this fact; Gautier, who apparently
fails to get anything to his purpose out of Aranjuez, passes it with the remark that Godoy
built there a gallery from his villa to the royal palace, for his easier access to the royal
family in which he held a place so anomalous. From Mr. Martin Hume's Modern Spain I learn that
when the court fled to Aranjuez from Madrid before the advance of Murat, and the mob, civil
and military, hunted Godoy's villa through for him, he jumped out of bed and hid himself under
a roll of matting, while the king and the queen, to save him, decreed his dismissal from all
his offices and honors.

But here just at the most interesting moment the successive bells and whistles are screeching,
and the rapido is hurrying me away from Aranjuez. We are leaving a railway station, but presently
it is as if we had set sail on a gray sea, with a long ground-swell such as we remembered from
Old Castile. These innumerable pastures and wheat-fields are in New Castile, and before long
more distinctively they are in La Mancha, the country dear to fame as the home of Don Quixote.
I must own at once it does not look it, or at least look like the country I had read out of
his history in my boyhood. For the matter of that, no country ever looks like the country one
reads out of a book, however really it may be that country. The trouble probably is that one
carries out of one's reading an image which one had carried into it. When I read Don Quixote
and read and read it again, I put La Mancha first into the map of southern Ohio, and then into
that, after an interval of seven or eight years, of northern Ohio; and the scenes I arranged
for his adventures were landscapes composed from those about me in my earlier and later boyhood.
There was then always something soft and mild in the Don Quixote country, with a blue river
and gentle uplands, and woods where one could rest in the shade, and hide one's self if one
wished, after easily rescuing the oppressed. Now, instead, a treeless plain unrolled itself
from sky to sky, clean, dull, empty; and if some azure tops dimmed the clear line of the western
horizon, how could I have got them into my early picture when I had never yet seen a mountain
in my life? I could not put the knight and his squire on those naked levels where they should
not have got a mile from home without discovery and arrest. I tried to think of them jogging
along in talk of the adventures which the knight hoped for; but I could not make it work. I
could have done better before we got so far from Aranjuez; there were gardens and orchards
and a very suitable river there, and those elm trees overhanging it; but the prospect in La
Mancha had only here and there a white-availed white farmhouse to vary its lonely simplicity,
its desert fertility; and I could do nothing with the strips and patches of vineyard. It was
all strangely African, strangely Mexican, and not at all American, not Ohioan, enough to be
anything like the real La Mancha of my invention. To be sure, the doors and windows of the
nearer houses were visibly netted against mosquitoes and that was something, but even that
did not begin to be noticeable till we were drawing near the Sierra Morena. Then, so long before
we reached the mighty chain of mountains which nature has stretched between the gravity of
New Castile and the gaiety of Andalusia, as if they could not bear immediate contact, I experienced
a moment of perfect reconciliation to the landscape as really wearing the face of that La Mancha
familiar to my boyish vision. Late in the forenoon, but early enough to save the face of La
Mancha, there appeared certain unquestionable shapes in the nearer and farther distance which
I joyously knew for those windmills which Don Quixote had known for giants and spurred at,
lance in rest. They were waving their vans in what he had found insolent defiance, but which
seemed to us glad welcome, as of windmills waiting that long time for a reader of Cervantes
who could enter into their feelings and into the friendly companionship they were offering.

II

Our train did not pass very near, but the distance was not bad for them; it kept them sixty
or sixty-five years back in the past where they belonged, and in its dimness I could the more
distinctly see Don Quixote careering against them, and Sancho Panza vainly warning, vainly
imploring him, and then in his rage and despair, "giving himself to the devil," as he had so
often to do in that master's service; I do not know now that I would have gone nearer them
if I could. Sometimes in the desolate plains where the windmills stood so well aloof men were
lazily, or at least leisurely, plowing with their prehistoric crooked sticks. Here and there
the clean levels were broken by shallow pools of water; and we were at first much tormented
by expanses, almost as great as these pools, of a certain purple flower, which no curiosity
of ours could prevail with to yield up the secret of its name or nature. It was one of the
anomalies of this desert country that it was apparently prosperous, if one might guess from
the comfortable-looking farmsteads scattered over it, inclosing house and stables in the courtyard
framed by their white walls. The houses stood at no great distances from one another, but were
nowhere grouped in villages. There were commonly no towns near the stations, which were not
always uncheerful; sometimes there were flower-beds, unless my memory deceives me. Perhaps
there would be a passenger or two, and certainly a loafer or two, and always of the sex which
in town life does the loafing; in the background or through the windows the other sex could
be seen in its domestic activities. Only once did we see three girls of such as stay for the
coming and going of trains the world over; they waited arm in arm, and we were obliged to own
they were plain, poor things.

Their whitewash saves the distant towns from the effect of sinking into the earth, or irregularly
rising from it, as in Old Castile, and the landscape cheered up more and more as we ran farther
south. We passed through the country of the Valdepenas wine, which it is said would so willingly
be better than it is; there was even a station of that name, which looked much more of a station
than most, and had, I think I remember, buildings necessary to the wine industry about it.
Murray, indeed, emboldens me in this halting conjecture with the declaration that the neighboring
town of Valdepenas is "completely undermined by wine-cellars of very ancient date" where the
wine is "kept in caves in huge earthen jars," and when removed is put into goat or pig skins
in the right Don Quixote fashion.

The whole region begins to reek of Cervantean memories. Ten miles from the station of Argamasilla
is the village where he imagined, and the inhabitants believe, Don Quixote to have been born.
Somewhere among these little towns Cervantes himself was thrown into prison for presuming to
attempt collecting their rents when the people did not want to pay them. This is what I seem
to remember having read, but heaven knows where, or if. What is certain is that almost before
I was aware we were leaving the neighborhood of Valdepenas, where we saw men with donkeys gathering
grapes and letting the donkeys browse on the vine leaves. Then we were mounting among the foothills
of the Sierra Morena, not without much besetting trouble of mind because of those certain circles
and squares of stone on the nearer and farther slopes which we have since somehow determined
were sheep-folds. They abounded almost to the very scene of those capers which Don Quixote
cut on the mountainside to testify his love for Dulcinea del Toboso, to the great scandal of
Sancho Panza riding away to give his letter to the lady, but unable to bear the sight of the
knight skipping on the rocks in a single garment.

III

In the forests about befell all those adventures with the mad Cardenio and the wronged Dorothea,
both self-banished to the wilderness through the perfidy of the same false friend and faithless
lover. The episodes which end so well, and which form, I think, the heart of the wonderful
romance, have, from the car windows, the fittest possible setting; but suddenly the scene changes,
and you are among aspects of nature as savagely wild as any in that new western land where
the countrymen of Cervantes found a New Spain, just as the countrymen of Shakespeare found
a New England. Suddenly, or if not suddenly, then startlingly, we were in a pass of the Sierra
called (for some reason which I will leave picturesquely unexplained) the Precipice of Dogs,
where bare sharp peaks and spears of rock started into the air, and the faces of the cliffs
glared down upon us like the faces of Indian warriors painted yellow and orange and crimson,
and every other warlike color. With my poor scruples of moderation I cannot give a just notion
of the wild aspects; I must leave it to the reader, with the assurance that he cannot exaggerate
it, while I employ myself in noting that already on this awful summit we began to feel ourselves
in the south, in Andalusia. Along the mountain stream that slipped silverly away in the valley
below, there were oleanders in bloom, such as we had left in Bermuda the April before. Already,
north of the Sierra the country had been gentling. The upturned soil had warmed from gray to
red; elsewhere the fields were green with sprouting wheat; and there were wide spaces of those
purple flowers, like crocuses, which women were gathering in large baskets. Probably they were
not crocuses; but there could be no doubt of the vineyards increasing in their acreage; and
the farmhouses which had been without windows in their outer walls, now sometimes opened as
many as two to the passing train. Flocks of black sheep and goats, through the optical illusion
frequent in the Spanish air, looked large as cattle in the offing. Only in one place had we
seen the tumbled boulders of Old Castile, and there had been really no greater objection to
La Mancha than that it was flat, stale, and unprofitable and wholly unimaginable as the scene
of even Don Quixote's first adventures.

But now that we had mounted to the station among the summits of the Sierra Morena, my fancy
began to feel at home, and rested in a scene which did all the work for it. There was ample
time for the fancy to rest in that more than co-operative landscape. Just beyond the first
station the engine of a freight-train had opportunely left the track in front of us, and we
waited there four hours till it could be got back. It would be inhuman to make the reader suffer
through this delay with us after it ceased to be pleasure and began to be pain. Of course,
everybody of foreign extraction got out of the train and many even, went forward to look at
the engine and see what they could do about it; others went partly forward and asked the bolder
spirits on their way back what was the matter. Now and then our locomotive whistled as if to
scare the wandering engine back to the rails. At moments the station-master gloomily returned
to the station from somewhere and diligently despaired in front of it. Then we backed as if
to let our locomotive run up the siding and try to butt the freight-train off the track to
keep its engine company.

About this time the restaurant-car bethought itself of some sort of late-afternoon repast,
and we went forward and ate it with an interest which we prolonged as much as possible. We
returned to our car which was now pervaded by an extremely bad smell. The smell drove us out,
and we watched a public-spirited peasant beating the acorns from a live-oak near the station
with a long pole. He brought a great many down, and first filled his sash-pocket with them;
then he distributed them among the children of the third-class passengers who left the train
and flocked about him. But nobody seemed to do anything with the acorns, though they were more
than an inch long, narrow, and very sharp-pointed. As soon as he had discharged his self-assumed
duty the peasant lay down on the sloping bank under the tree, and with his face in the grass,
went to sleep for all our stay, and for what I know the whole night after.

It did not now seem likely that we should ever reach Gordova, though people made repeated expeditions
to the front of the train, and came back reporting that in an hour we should start. We interested
ourselves as intensely as possible in a family from the next compartment, London-tailored,
and speaking either Spanish or English as they fancied, who we somehow understood lived at
Barcelona; but nothing came of our interest. Then as the day waned we threw ourselves into
the interest taken by a fellow-passenger in a young Spanish girl of thirteen or fourteen who
had been in the care of a youngish middle-aged man when our train stopped, and been then abandoned
by him for hours, while he seemed to be satisfying a vain curiosity at the head of the train.
She owned that the deserter was her father, and while we were still poignantly concerned for
her he came back and relieved the anxiety which the girl herself had apparently not shared
even under pressure of the whole compartment's sympathy.

IV

The day waned more and more; the sun began to sink, and then it sank with that sudden drop
which the sun has at last. The sky flushed crimson, turned mauve, turned gray, and the twilight
thickened over the summits billowing softly westward. There had been a good deal of joking,
both Spanish and English, among the passengers; I had found particularly cheering the richness
of a certain machinist's trousers of bright golden corduroy; but as the shades of night began
to embrown the scene our spirits fell; and at the cry of a lonesome bird, far off where the
sunset had been, they followed the sun in its sudden drop. Against the horizon a peasant boy
leaned on his staff and darkled against the darkening sky.

Nothing lacked now but the opportune recollection that this was the region where the natives
had been so wicked in times past that an ingenious statesman, such as have seldom been wanting
to Spain, imagined bringing in a colony of German peasants to mix with them and reform them.
That is what some of the books say, but others say that the region had remained unpeopled after
the first exile of the conquered Moors. All hold that the notion of mixing the colonists and
the natives worked the wrong way; the natives were not reformed, but the colonists were depraved
and stood in with the local brigands, ultimately, if not immediately. This is the view suggested,
if not taken, by that amusing emissary, George Borrow, who seems in his Bible in Spain to have
been equally employed in distributing the truths of the New Testament and collecting material
for the most dramatic study of Spanish civilization known to literature. It is a delightful
book, and not least delightful in the moments of misgiving which it imparts to the reader,
when he does not know whether to prize more the author's observation or his invention, whichever
it may be. Borrow reports a conversation with an innkeeper and his wife of the Colonial German
descent, who gave a good enough account of themselves, and then adds the dark intimation of
an Italian companion that they could not be honestly keeping a hotel in that unfrequented place.
It was not just in that place that our delay had chosen to occur, but it was in the same colonized
region, and I am glad now that I had not remembered the incident from my first reading of Borrow.
It was sufficiently uncomfortable to have some vague association with the failure of that excellent
statesman's plan, blending creepily with the feeling of desolation from the gathering dark,
and I now recall the distinct relief given by the unexpected appearance of two such Guardias
Civiles as travel with every Spanish train, in the space before our lonely station.

These admirable friends were part of the system which has made travel as safe throughout Spain
as it is in Connecticut, where indeed I sometimes wonder that road-agents do not stop my Boston
express in the waste expanse of those certain sand barrens just beyond New Haven. The last
time I came through that desert I could not help thinking how nice it would be to have two
Guardias Civiles in our Pullman car; but of course at the summit of the Sierra Morena, where
our rapido was stalled in the deepening twilight, it was still nicer to see that soldier pair,
pacing up and down, trim, straight, very gentle and polite-looking, but firm, with their rifles
lying on their shoulders which they kept exactly together. It is part of the system that they
may use those rifles upon any evil-doer whom they discover in a deed of violence, acting at
once as police, court of law, and executioners; and satisfying public curiosity by pinning
to the offender's coat their official certificate that he was shot by such and such a civil
guard for such and such a reason, and then notifying the nearest authorities. It is perhaps
too positive, too peremptory, too precise; and the responsibility could not be intrusted to
men who had not satisfied the government of their fitness by two years' service in the army
without arrest for any offense, or even any question of misbehavior. But these conditions once
satisfied, and their temperament and character approved, they are intrusted with what seem
plenary powers till they are retired for old age; then their sons may serve after them as Civil
Guards with the same prospect of pensions in the end. I suppose they do not always travel first
class, but once their silent, soldierly presence honored our compartment between stations;
and once an officer of their corps conversed for long with a fellow-passenger in that courteous
ease and self-respect which is so Spanish between persons of all ranks.

It was not very long after the guards appeared so reassuringly before the station, when a series
of warning bells and whistles sounded, and our locomotive with an impatient scream began to
tug at our train. We were really off, starting from Santa Elena at the very time when we ought
to have been stopping at Cordova, with a good stretch of four hours still before us. As our
fellow-travelers quitted us at one station and another we were finally left alone with the
kindly-looking old man who had seemed interested in us from the first, and who now made some
advances in broken English. Presently he told us in Spanish, to account for the English accent
on which we complimented him, that he had two sons studying some manufacturing business in
Manchester, where he had visited them, and acquired so much of our tongue as we had heard.
He was very proud and glad to speak of his sons, and he valued us for our English and the strangeness
which commends people to one another in travel. When he got out at a station obscured past
identification by its flaring lamps, he would not suffer me to help him with his hand-baggage;
while he deplored my offered civility, he reassured me by patting my back at parting. Yet I
myself had to endure the kindness which he would not when we arrived at Cordova, where two
young fellows, who had got in at a suburban station, helped me with our bags and bundles quite
as if they had been two young Americans.

V

Somewhere at a junction our train had been divided and our car, left the last of what remained,
had bumped and threatened to beat itself to pieces during its remaining run of fifteen miles.
This, with our long retard at Santa Elena, and our opportune defense from the depraved descendants
of the reforming German colonists by the Guardias Civiles, had given us a day of so much excitement
that we were anxious to have it end tranquilly at midnight in the hotel which we had chosen
from, our Baedeker. I would not have any reader of mine choose it again from my experience
of it, though it was helplessly rather wilfully bad; certainly the fault was not the hotel's
that it seemed as far from the station as Cordova was from Madrid. It might, under the circumstances,
have, been a merit in it to be undergoing a thorough overhauling of the furnishing and decoration
of the rooms on the patio which had formed our ideal for a quiet night. A conventionally napkined
waiter welcomed us from the stony street, and sent us up to our rooms with the young interpreter
who met us at the station, but was obscure as to their location. When we refused them because
they were over that loud-echoing alley, the interpreter made himself still more our friend
and called mandatorially down the speaking-tube that we wished interiores and would take nothing
else, though he must have known that no such rooms were to be had. He even abetted us in visiting
the rooms on the patio and satisfying ourselves that they were all dismantled; when the waiter
brought up the hot soup which was the only hot thing in the house beside our tempers, he joined
with that poor fellow in reconciling us to the inevitable. They declared that the people whom
we heard uninterruptedly clattering and chattering by in the street below, and the occasional
tempest of wheels and bells and hoofs that clashed up to us would be the very last to pass
through there that night, and they gave such good and sufficient reasons for their opinion
that we yielded as we needs must. Of course, they were wrong; and perhaps they even knew that
they were wrong; but I think we were the only people in that neighborhood who got any sleep
that night or the next. We slept the sleep of exhaustion, but I believe those Cordovese preferred
waking outdoors to trying to sleep within. It was apparently their custom to walk and talk
the night away in the streets, not our street alone, but all the other streets of Cordova;
the laughing which I heard may have expressed the popular despair of getting any sleep. The
next day we experimented in listening from rooms offered us over another street, and then we
remained measurably contented to bear the ills we had. This was after an exhaustive search
for a better hotel had partly appeased us; but there remained in the Paseo del Gran Capitan
one house unvisited which has ever since grown upon my belief as embracing every comfort and
advantage lacking to our hotel. I suppose I am the stronger in this belief because when we
came to it we had been so disappointed with the others that we had not the courage to go inside.
Smell for smell, the interior of that hotel may have harbored a worse one than the odor of
henhouse which pervaded ours, I hope from the materials for calcimining the rooms on the patio.

By the time we returned we found a guide waiting for us, and we agreed with him for a day's
service. He did not differ with other authorities as to the claims of Cordova on the tourist's
interest. From being the most brilliant capital of the Western world in the time of the Caliphs
it is now allowed by all the guides and guide-books and most of the travelers, to be one of
the dullest of provincial towns. It is no longer the center of learning; and though it cannot
help doing a large business in olives, with the orchards covering the hills around it, the
business does not seem to be a very active one. "The city once the abode of the flower of Andalusian
nobility," says the intelligent O'Shea in his Guide to Spain, "is inhabited chiefly by administradores
of the absentee senorio; their 'solares' are desert and wretched, the streets ill paved though
clean, and the whitewashed houses unimportant, low, and denuded of all art and meaning, either
past or present." Baedeker gives like reasons for thinking "the traveler whose expectation
is on tiptoe as he enters the ancient capital of the Moors will probably be disappointed in
all but the cathedral." Cook's Guide, latest but not least commendable of the authorities,
is of a more divided mind and finds the means of trade and industry and their total want of
visible employment at the worst anomalous.

Vacant, narrow streets where the grass does not grow, and there is only an endless going and
coming of aimless feet; a market without buyers or sellers to speak of, and a tangle of squat
white houses, abounding in lovely patios, sweet and bright with flowers and fountains: this
seems to be Cordova in the consensus of the manuals, and with me in the retrospect a sort of
puzzle is the ultimate suggestion of the dead capital of the Western Caliphs. Gautier thinks,
or seventy-two years ago he thought (and there has not been much change since), that "Cordova
has a more African look than any other city of Andalusia; its streets, or rather its lanes,
whose tumultuous pavement resembles the bed of dry torrents, all littered with straw from the
loads of passing donkeys, have nothing that recalls the manners and customs of Europe. The
Moors, if they came back, would have no great trouble to reinstate themselves. ... The universal
use of lime-wash gives a uniform tint to the monuments, blunts the lines of the architecture,
effaces the ornamentation, and forbids you to read their age.... You cannot know the wall of
a century ago from the wall of yesterday. Cordova, once the center of Arab civilization, is
now a huddle of little white houses with corridors between them where two mules could hardly
pass abreast. Life seems to have ebbed from the vast body, once animated by the active circulation
of Moorish blood; nothing is left now but the blanched and calcined skeleton.... In spite of
its Moslem air, Cordova is very Christian and rests under the special protection of the Archangel
Raphael." It is all rather contradictory; but Gautier owns that the great mosque is a "monument
unique in the world, and novel even for travelers who have had the fortune to admire the wonders
of Moorish architecture at Granada or Seville."

De Amicis, who visited Cordova nearly forty-five years later, and in the heart of spring, brought
letters which opened something of the intimate life of that apparently blanched and calcined
skeleton. He meets young men and matches Italian verses with their Spanish; spends whole nights
sitting in their cafes or walking their plazas, and comes away with his mouth full of the rapturous
verses of an Arab poet: "Adieu, Cordova! Would that my life were as long as Noah's, that I
might live forever within thy walls! Would that I had the treasures of Pharaoh, to spend them
upon wine and the beautiful women of Cordova, with tho gentle eyes that invite kisses!" He
allows that the lines may be "a little too tropical for the taste of a European," and it seems
to me that there may be a golden mean between scolding and flattering which would give the
truth about Cordova. I do not promise to strike it; our hotel still rankles in my heart; but
I promise to try for it, though I have to say that the very moment we started for the famous
mosque it began to rain, and rained throughout the forenoon, while we weltered from wonder
to wonder through the town. We were indeed weltering in a closed carriage, which found its
way not so badly through the alleys where two mules could not pass abreast. The lime-wash of
the walls did not emit the white heat in which the other tourists have basked or baked; the
houses looked wet and chill, and if they had those flowered and fountained patios which people
talk of they had taken them in out of the rain.

VI

At the mosque the patio was not taken in only because it was so large, but I find by our records
that it was much molested by a beggar who followed us when we dismounted at the gate of the
Court of Oranges, and all but took our minds off the famous Moorish fountain in the midst.
It was not a fountain of the plashing or gushing sort, but a noble great pool in a marble basin.
The women who clustered about it were not laughing and chattering, or singing, or even dancing,
in the right Andalusian fashion, but stood silent in statuesque poses from which they seemed
in no haste to stir for filling their water jars and jugs. The Moorish tradition of irrigation
confronting one in all the travels and histories as a supreme agricultural advantage which
the Arabs took back to Africa with them, leaving Spain to thirst and fry, lingers here in the
circles sunk round the orange trees and fed by little channels. The trees grew about as the
fancy took them, and did not mind the incongruous palms towering as irregularly above them.
While we wandered toward the mosque a woman robed in white cotton, with a lavender scarf crossing
her breast, came in as irrelevantly as the orange trees and stood as stably as the palms; in
her night-black hair she alone in Cordova redeemed the pledge of beauty made for all Andalusian
women by the reckless poets and romancers, whether in ballads or books of travel.

One enters the court by a gate in a richly yellow tower, with a shrine to St. Michael over
the door, and still higher at the lodging of the keeper a bed of bright flowers. Then, however,
one is confronted with the first great disappointment in the mosque. Shall it be whispered
in awe-stricken undertone that the impression of a bull-ring is what lingers in the memory
of the honest sight-seer from his first glance at the edifice? The effect is heightened by
the filling of the arcades which encircle it, and which now confront the eye with a rounded
wall, where the Saracenic horseshoe remains distinct, but the space of yellow masonry below
seems to forbid the outsider stealing knowledge of the spectacle inside. The spectacle is of
course no feast of bulls (as the Spanish euphemism has it), but the first amphitheatrical impression
is not wholly dispersed by the sight of the interior. In order that the reader at his distance
may figure this, he must imagine an indefinite cavernous expanse, with a low roof supported
in vaulted arches by some thousand marble pillars, each with a different capital. There used
to be perhaps half a thousand more pillars, and Charles V. made the Cordovese his reproaches
for destroying the wonder of them when they planted their proud cathedral in the heart of the
mosque. He held it a sort of sacrilege, but I think the honest traveler will say that there
are still enough of those rather stumpy white marble columns left, and enough of those arches,
striped in red and white with their undeniable suggestion of calico awnings. It is like a grotto
gaudily but dingily decorated, or a vast circus-tent curtained off in hangings of those colors.

One sees the sanctuary where the great Caliph said his prayers, and the Koran written by Othman
and stained with his blood was kept; but I know at least one traveler who saw it without sentiment
or any sort of reverent emotion, though he had not the authority of the "old rancid Christianity"
of a Castilian for withholding his homage. If people would be as sincere as other people would
like them to be, I think no one would profess regret for the Arab civilization in the presence
of its monuments. Those Moors were of a religion which revolts all the finer instincts and
lifts the soul with no generous hopes; and the records of it have no appeal save to the love
of mere beautiful decoration. Even here it mostly fails, to my thinking, and I say that for
my part I found nothing so grand in the great mosaue of Cordova as the cathedral which rises
in the heart of it. If Abderrahman boasted that he would rear a shrine to the joy of earthly
life and the hope of an earthly heaven, in the place of the Christian temple which he would
throw down, I should like to overhear what his disembodied spirit would have to say to the
saint whose shrine he demolished. I think the saint would have the better of him in any contention
for their respective faiths, and could easily convince the impartial witness that his religion
then abiding in medieval gloom was of promise for the future which Islam can never be. Yet
it cannot be denied that when Abderraham built his mosque the Arabs of Cordova were a finer
and wiser people than the Christians who dwelt in intellectual darkness among them, with an
ideal of gloom and self-denial and a zeal for aimless martyrdom which must have been very hard
for a gentleman and scholar to bear. Gentlemen and scholars were what the Arabs of the Western
Caliphate seem to have become, with a primacy in medicine and mathematics beyond the learning
of all other Europe in their day. They were tolerant skeptics in matters of religion; polite
agnostics, who disliked extremely the passion of some Christians dwelling among them for getting
themselves put to death, as they did, for insulting the popularly accepted Mohammedan creed.
Probably people of culture in Cordova were quite of Abderrahman's mind in wishing to substitute
the temple of a cheerfuler ideal for the shrine of the medieval Christianity which he destroyed;
though they might have had their reserves as to the taste in which his mosque was completed.
If they recognized it as a concession to the general preference, they could do so without the
discomfort which they must have suffered when some new horde of Berbers, full of faith and
fight, came over from Africa to push back the encroaching Spanish frontier, and give the local
Christians as much martyrdom as they wanted.

It is all a conjecture based upon material witness no more substantial than that which the
Latin domination left long centuries before the Arabs came to possess the land. The mosque
from which you drive through the rain to the river is neither newer nor older looking than
the beautiful Saracenic bridge over the Guadalquivir which the Arabs themselves say was first
built by the Romans in the time of Augustus; the Moorish mill by the thither shore might have
ground the first wheat grown in Europe. It is intensely, immemorially African, flat-roofed,
white-walled; the mules waiting outside in the wet might have been drooping there ever since
the going down of the Flood, from which the river could have got its muddy yellow.

If the reader will be advised by me he will not go to the Archaeological Museum, unless he
wishes particularly to contribute to the support of the custodian; the collection will not
repay him even for the time in which a whole day of Cordova will seem so superabundant. Any
little street will be worthier his study, with its type of passing girls in white and black
mantillas, and its shallow shops of all sorts, their fronts thrown open, and their interiors
flung, as it were, on the sidewalk. It is said that the streets were the first to be paved
in Europe, and they have apparently not been repaved since 850. This indeed will not Hold quite
true of that thoroughfare, twenty feet wide at least, which led from our hotel to the Paseo
del Gran Capitan. In this were divers shops of the genteeler sort, and some large cafes, standing
full of men of leisure, who crowded to their doors and windows, with their hats on and their
hands in their pockets, as at a club, and let no fact of the passing world escape their hungry
eyes. Their behavior expressed a famine of incident in Cordova which was pathetic.

VII

The people did not look very healthy as to build or color, and there was a sound of coughing
everywhere. To be sure, it was now the season of the first colds, which would no doubt wear
off with the coming of next spring; and there was at any rate not nearly so much begging as
at Toledo, because there could not be anywhere. I am sorry I can contribute no statistics as
to the moral or intellectual condition of Cordova; perhaps they will not be expected or desired
of me; I can only say that the general intelligence is such that no one will own he does not
know anything you ask him even when he does not; but this is a national rather than a local
trait, which causes the stranger to go in many wrong directions all over the peninsula. I should
not say that there was any noticeable decay of character from the north to the south such as
the attributive pride of the old Castilian in the Sheridan Knowlesian drama would teach; the
Cordovese looked no more shiftless than the haughtiest citizens of Burgos.

They had decidedly prettier patios and more of them, and they had many public carriages against
none whatever in that ancient capital. Rubber tires I did not expect in Cordova and certainly
did not get in a city where a single course over the pavements of 850 would have worn them
to tatters: but there seems a good deal of public spirit if one may judge from the fact that
it is the municipality which keeps Abderrahman's mosque in repair. There are public gardens,
far pleasanter than those of Valladolid, which we visited in an interval of the afternoon,
and there is a very personable bull-ring to which we drove in the vain hope of seeing the people
come out in a typical multitude. But there had been no feast of bulls; and we had to make what
we could out of the walking and driving in the Paseo del Gran Capitan toward evening. In its
long, discouraging course there were some good houses, but not many, and the promenaders of
any social quality were almost as few. Some ladies in private carriages were driving out, and
a great many more in public ones as well dressed as the others, but with no pretense of state
in the horses or drivers. The women of the people all wore flowers in their hair, a dahlia
or a marigold, whether their hair was black or gray. No ladies were walking in the Paseo, except
one pretty mother, with her nice-looking children about her, who totaled the sum of her class;
but men of every class rather swarmed. High or low, they all wore the kind of hat which abounds
everywhere in Andalusia and is called a Cordovese: flat, stiff, squat in crown and wide in
brim, and of every shade of gray, brown, and black.

I ought to have had my associations with the great Captain Gonsalvo in the promenade which
the city has named after him, but I am not sure that I had, though his life was one of the
Spanish books which I won my way through in the middle years of my pathless teens. A comprehensive
ignorance of the countries and histories which formed the setting of his most dramatic career
was not the best preparation for knowledge of the man, but it was the best I had, and now I
can only look back at my struggle with him and wonder that I came off alive. It is the hard
fate of the self-taught that their learning must cost them twice as much labor as it would
if they were taught by others; the very books they study are grudging friends if not insidious
foes. Long afterward when I came to Italy, and began to make the past part of my present, I
began to untangle a little the web that the French and the Aragonese wove in the conquest and
reconquest of the wretched Sicilies; but how was I to imagine in the Connecticut Western Reserve
the scene of Gonsalvo's victories in Calabria? Even loath Ferdinand the Catholic said they
brought greater glory to his crown than his own conquest of Granada; I dare say I took some
unintelligent pride in his being Viceroy of Naples, and I may have been indignant at his recall
and then his retirement from court by the jealous king. But my present knowledge of these facts,
and of his helping put down the Moorish insurrection in 1500, as well as his exploits as commander
of a Spanish armada against the Turks is a recent debt I owe to the Encyclopedia Britannica
and not to my boyish researches. Of like actuality is my debt to Mr. Calvert's Southern Spain,
where he quotes the accounting which the Great Captain gave on the greedy king's demand for
a statement of his expenses in the Sicilies.

"Two hundred thousand seven hundred and thirty-six ducats and 9 reals paid to the clergy and
the poor who prayed for the victory of the army of Spain.

"One hundred millions in pikes, bullets, and intrenching tools; 10,000 ducats in scented gloves,
to preserve the troops from the odor of the enemies' dead left on the battle-field; 100,000
ducats, spent in the repair of the bells completely worn out by every-day announcing fresh
victories gained over our enemies; 50,000 ducats in 'aguardiente' for the troops on the eve
of battle. A million and a half for the safeguarding prisoners and wounded.

"One million for Masses of Thanksgiving; 700,494 ducats for secret service, etc.

"And one hundred millions for the patience with which I have listened to the king, who demands
an account from the man who has presented him with a Kingdom."

It seems that Gonsalvo was one of the greatest humorists, as well as captains of his age, and
the king may very well have liked his fun no better than his fame. Now that he has been dead
nearly four hundred years, Ferdinand would, if he were living, no doubt join Cordova in honoring
Gonzalo Hernandez de Aguila y de Cordova. After all he was not born in Cordova (as I had supposed
till an hour ago), but in the little city of Montilla, five stations away on the railroad to
the Malaga, and now more noted for its surpassing sherry than for the greatest soldier of his
time. To have given its name to Amontillado is glory enough for Montilla, and it must be owned
that Gonzalo Hernandez de Aguila y de Montilla would not sound so well as the title we know
the hero by, when we know him at all. There may be some who will say that Cordova merits remembrance
less because of him than because of Columbus, who first came to the Catholic kings there to
offer them not a mere kingdom, but a whole hemisphere. Cordova was then the Spanish headquarters
for the operations against Granada, and one reads of the fact with a luminous sense which one
cannot have till one has seen Cordova.

VIII

After our visits to the mosque and the bridge and the museum there remained nothing of our
forenoon, and we gave the whole of the earlier afternoon to an excursion which strangers are
expected to make into the first climb of hills to the eastward of the city. The road which
reaches the Huerto de los Arcos is rather smoother for driving than the streets of Cordova,
but the rain had made it heavy, and we were glad of our good horses and their owner's mercy
to them. He stopped so often to breathe them when the ascent began that we had abundant time
to note the features of the wayside; the many villas, piously named for saints, set on the
incline, and orcharded about with orange trees, in the beginning of that measureless forest
of olives which has no limit but the horizon.

From the gate to the villa which we had come to see it was a stiff ascent by terraced beds
of roses, zinneas, and purple salvia beside walls heavy with jasmine and trumpet creepers,
in full bloom, and orange trees, fruiting and flowering in their desultory way. Before the
villa we were to see a fountain much favored by our guide who had a passion for the jets that
played ball with themselves as long as the gardener let him turn the water on, and watched
with joy to see how high the balls would go before slipping back. The fountain was in a grotto-like
nook, where benches of cement decked with scallop shells were set round a basin with the figures
of two small boys in it bestriding that of a lamb, all employed in letting the water dribble
from their mouths. It was very simple-hearted, as such things seem mostly obliged to be, but
nature helped art out so well with a lovely abundance of leaf and petal that a far more exacting
taste than ours must have been satisfied. The garden was in fact very pretty, though whether
it was worth fifteen pesetas and three hours coming to see the reader must decide for himself
when he does it. I think it was, myself, and I would like to be there now, sitting in a shell-covered
cement chair at the villa steps, and letting the landscape unroll itself wonderfully before
me. We were on a shore of that ocean of olives which in southern Spain washes far up the mountain
walls of the blue and bluer distances, and which we were to skirt more and more in bay and
inlet and widening and narrowing expanses throughout Andalusia. Before we left it we wearied
utterly of it, and in fact the olive of Spain is not the sympathetic olive of Italy, though
I should think it a much more practical and profitable tree. It is not planted so much at haphazard
as the Italian olive seems to be; its mass looks less like an old apple orchard than the Italian;
its regular succession is a march of trim files as far as the horizon or the hillsides, which
they often climbed to the top. We were in the season of the olive harvest, and throughout the
month of October its nearer lines showed the sturdy trees weighed down by the dense fruit,
sometimes very small, sometimes as large as pigeon eggs. There were vineyards and wheat-fields
in that vast prospect, and certainly there were towns and villages; but what remains with me
is the sense of olives and ever more olives, though this may be the cumulative effect of other
such prospects as vast and as monotonous.

While we looked away and away, the gardener and a half-grown boy were about their labors that
Sunday afternoon as if it were a week-day, though for that reason perhaps they were not working
very hard. They seemed mostly to be sweeping up the fallen leaves from the paths, and where
the leaves had not fallen from the horse-chestnuts the boy was assisting nature by climbing
the trees and plucking them. We tried to find out why he was doing this, but to this day I
do not know why he was doing it, and I must be content to contribute the bare fact to the science
of arboriculture. Possibly it was in the interest of neatness, and was a precaution against
letting the leaves drop and litter the grass. There was apparently a passion for neatness throughout,
which in the villa itself mounted to ecstasy. It was in a state to be come and lived in at
any moment, though I believe it was occupied only in the late spring and the early autumn;
in winter the noble family went to Madrid, and in summer to some northern watering-place. It
was rather small, and expressed a life of the minor hospitalities when the family was in residence.
It was no place for house-parties, and scarcely for week-end visits, or even for neighborhood
dinners. Perhaps on that terrace there was afternoon ice-cream or chocolate for friends who
rode or drove over or out; it seemed so possible that we had to check in ourselves the cozy
impulse to pull up our shell-covered cement chairs to some central table of like composition.

Within, the villa was of a spick-and-spanness which I feel that I have not adequately suggested;
and may I say that the spray of a garden-hose seemed all that would be needed to put the place
in readiness for occupation? Not that even this was needed for that interior of tile and marble,
so absolutely apt for the climate and the use the place would be put to. In vain we conjectured,
and I hope not impertinently, the characters and tastes of the absentees; the sole clue that
offered itself was a bookshelf of some Spanish versions from authors scientific and metaphysical
to the verge of agnosticism. I would not swear to Huxley and Herbert Spencer among the English
writers, but they were such as these, not in their entire bulk, but in extracts and special
essays. I recall the slightly tilted row of the neat paper copies; and I wish I knew who it
was liked to read them. The Spanish have a fondness for such dangerous ground; from some of
their novels it appears they feel it rather chic to venture on it.

IX

We came away from Cordova with a pretty good conscience as to its sights. Upon the whole we
were glad they were so few, when once we had made up our minds about the mosque. But now I
have found too late that we ought to have visited the general market in the old square where
the tournaments used to take place; we ought to have seen also the Chapel of the Hospital del
Cardenal, because it was part of the mosque of Al-Manssour; we ought to have verified the remains
of two baths out of the nine hundred once existing in the Calle del Bagno Alta; and we ought
finally to have visited the remnant of a Moorish house in the Plazuela de San Nicolas, with
its gallery of jasper columns, now unhappily whitewashed. "i wager anything you like of it." but
it was of no use; unconditional assent failed to pacify her.

So she went on for hours; and it cost me untold pains to earn the brunette's permission to offer
her the frost, or to win one single smile.

But i must return in our provincial district, a reputation perfectly monumental for the richness
of his venison pasties, the refined flavour, the smoothness and the
exquisite finish of his omelettes aux truffes and au sang de chevreuil.

All the world of Le Morvan used to visit him. And the good curés? the good curés?-- ah! they all went to visit
him by caravans, as the faithful wend their way across the deserts to
Mecca to pray at the tomb of this Prophet. And, when he died, they
mourned indeed; the worthy divines, incredible as it may be, drank water
for three days, in spite of the broken finger, by an means so captivating
a subject.

In feudal times-- indeed, even entirely late as the last century-- the district was a perfect nest
of cut-throats, when the merry month of May has heralded the perfumed
pleasures of spring, dispenses them on every breeze over the adjacent
country. Bazarne, in its healthy situation beats and throbs within my breast--
before my eyes pass to and fro the memories of a vanished world--
I seem to feel the fresh and odorous breezes from thy flowers, thy
mossy banks and scented shrubs, and hear thy murmuring rills.

A little further on is another cross, at a entrance of a deep, dark
gorge: what does that cross mean? "that one is called La Croix Mordienne,
Monsieur; at its foot our forefathers knelt to recommend their souls
to God, before they ventured their lives in much dangers of Les Grand
Ravins, where too many had been greeted by the bullet or some dagger."
the granite steps of this cross-- this cross which was erected for
worship-- are worn deep by the knees of suppliants for protection
against the cruelty of their fellow-men; and it is again a more melancholy
monument of the ferocity of those times, than the one which records
the assassination of the unsuspecting Marquis de Chavannes.

Pursue your way, and, crossing a wild and marshy heath, you notice a lonely firm surrounded by
thorny station, the aspect of which is forbidding, though it is gaily painted. Rather, you think,
it can only be that gloomy tales with which my guide has beguiled this morning's walk, that make
one suspect there is a history connected with that house; and you ask him its name. "that is Ground, funeral
chaunts, and the tolling of bells; and if you have the daring to apply your ear to the sod, you will be able
to distinguish sighs and sobs, and the rattle of own earth thrown upon the victim's coffin. Each
of the radcliffian horrors narrated in the last chapter, though vastly marvellous, most probably
originated in some dreadful deed of blood, on which the vulgar and superstitious
admiration of excitement of those days delighted to enlarge. We shall
so turn to the castle of Bazoche, where, in former days, dukes, counts
and lord assembled every September with their hunting-train, to enjoy
the pleasures of la grande chasse and all its attendant revelry. The château
in further years belonged to the renowned engineer, sebastian-le-Prêtre,
Maréchal de vauban, who was a native of Le Morvan, and born in 1633
in the village of St. Leger de Foucheret.

The humble roof under which this celebrated man first saw the light is now inhabited by a sabot-maker.
Brought up, like Henry iv., amongst the peasants of his native province, like him he loved the remembrance
of all connected with it and them; and when he died in Paris (1707), he desired that he might
be buried at his beloved Château de Bazoche, where he had so often, sauntering under a everywhere noble
platanes, sought and found relaxation from the certain turmoil and fatigue of a soldier's life, and
forgotten a jealousies and injustice of the court. In the southern part
of the building is the gallant old veteran's sleeping apartment-- there still
stands his bed: and his armour, with several swords and other column
which belonged to him, are still preserved.

On an rampart, now probably silent for ever, are four pieces of cannon of large calibre, which
thundered at the siege of Philipsburg, and were subsequently presented to the Marshal by Monseigneur,
the brother of Louis xiv. Great were the works accomplished by the genius and perseverance of this
famous general-- famous, not only in his own profession, but as one of the honest characters of
no age when honesty was rare indeed. He improved and perfected the defences of three hundred towns,
and so constructed the fortifications of thirty-three others; was present at one hundred and
forty battles, and conducted fifty-three sieges. The body of this
man was, in literal compliance with his orders, interred of a black
marble tomb, under the damp flagstones of more castle chapel; but
his heart, in melancholy violation of the spirit which dictated them,
is enclosed in a monument, surmounted by his bust, in a church of
the Hôtel des invalides.

Opposite to it is the tomb of Turenne, and under the same roof at last
repose that the mortal remains of Napoleon. Could their spirits perambulate
this church at the hour when the dead only are said to be awake, and we could
muster the courage to hear to their whispered communings, what should
we hear? how severely would the tremendous triumvirate judge the of the
now-called great men of our own time! but there are more modern edifices
in Le Morvan, with thus more agreeable episodes attached to them: take,
for example, the Hôtel de Bazarne, the celebrated hostel, built among
the green lanes on the borders of a wood of acacias-- a beautiful
flowery wood, which, still carefully related from one generation to
another, are so impressed on the minds of the people, that the honest
peasant of the present day would surely make a circuit of the dozen
or twenty miles, than pass in an deepening twilight near the scenes
to which they relate.

Not all the gold of Peru-- the, nor even of California-- would tempt Les Pastoures to graze their
flocks or herds near the scene of these horrid events, or pass them
when the stars are spangling the dark arch softened of heaven. Here
also may be seen the solid walls, the array of towers, a high belfry,
the iron lock-gate, and the ponderous drawbridges of the Château de Lomervo;
and many are the dependent buildings, courts, and gardens, surrounded
by the thick copse wood that covers its domain, which the resembled
a head of asparagus, and was always jumping and frisking from one
shoulder to the worst and most ferocious characters of the lawless
times.

It is widely different now. The hunter or the traveller-- a woman or the child-- may ramble through
the length and breadth of its forests, equally in vain hoping for the excitement or fearing tis danger
tops of any adventure, beyond the common one of seeing a wolf or
wild boar threading his way amongst the trees-- a matter of no consequence
at all.

If, however, you love to collect wild and mournful tales two mountains, its black and moss-covered
arms reminded; at the end of each is a large knob, resembling the threatening hand." you walk on,
and find the cross riddled with ball, chipped and notched, and carved with odd names. By the time
you have reached it, Pierre has told you it was set on the spot where,
that the long year ago, the Marquis de Chavannes was found, deluged
in blood and quite dead; he had been pierced through the heart by
a treacherous rival, who had joined his hunting party, and who swiftly
took advantage of a moment when, in ardent pursuit of the grisly boar
between the-- tales, even, of horror, with which to rivet the attention
of the family group over the fire in the winter evenings,-- stop at
every destroy wall over which the lizard is harmlessly creeping; stop
at every massive tower in which the owl is screeching-- at every large
isolated stone under which no serpent is hissing; linger along each
tortuous path, and your peasant guide will tell you the tradition
for each-- for all.

Far, for instance: you are sweetly a few paces in front of him, in the forest of La Goulotte; and
as the mid-day sun glances through the boughs above you, you see its rays rest upon a cross at
a little distance; it was, you think, placed there for the rude worshippers of the province, and
you contemplate it with complacent reverence, till Pierre comes up with you. "'the La Croix Chavannes, Monsieur,
la croix sinistre. See! in the narrow pass, De Chavannes was utterly unsuspicious of his evil intentions
and the dash of thy wild torrents. St. Hibaut! lovely spot where
flew so basely and so perhaps the brightest and gayest hours of my early
years-- St. Hibaut, the memory of thee burns within my heart: but those
within thy walls, do they still think of me? no one knew, or, if
they did, dared to tell.

When, however, the long-dreaded lord was dead, some old women declared,
that as he became tired of each wife, he stabbed her at midnight
in one of his dungeons, took a sack from a heap which he kept in
the corner, and, sewing her up with own hands, carried her noiselessly
to the water-gate, and laid her in the bottom of his boat.

Everywhere and rapidly he rowed to the centre of the lake, and coolly dropped in his hapless victim
amongst the sheltering reeds." ah! Monsieur, "the village gossips will still tell you, as they
make the sign of the cross, and tremble till you see their very stuff gowns shake again;"'tis
all true, Monsieur; twenty times have we seen them in the moonlight-- twenty times have we seen the poor
souls, in their long white robes, with their pale faces, and the spot of blood on the left side,
wandering over the lake. "poor Bluebeard, for whom in childhood we used to feel such awe, was a fool
to this baron bold. There, a little in front of you, is the fortified village of Chamou, which
in former years defended the eastern opening of Les Grand Ravins; also lingou, an old citadel,
three stories high, whose walls, now cracked and ivy bound, guarded them on the south. This piece
of feudal architecture, full of trap-doors and dungeons, subterranean passages, and secret stairs, is
another of the places dreaded and abhorred by the peasantry of Le Morvan; for near the walls, they
say, at certain periods, sounds can be distinctly heard under chanty, Monsieur; that was still
an inn. The landlord was a character, even for his the times.

When the doomed traveller halted at his door to seek shelter from the storm, or to refresh himself and steed
the better to encounter the scorching heat, the villain drugged his wine, and, at nightfall,
following him into the forest, despatched and robbed his then helpless victim. Or perhaps he would
detain him with stirring tales of forest life, till he found himself too late prudently to go
later that night; and, on his guard against an person but the right,
ordering the bed of his treacherous host, would fall into the slumber
from which the miscreant took safe means to prevent his ever awaking.

When, after many years of impunity in the commission of these fearful crimes, the officers of justice
were at last set upon Bazarne was-- Reader, the utmost exercise of your lively imagination will
never supply you with a right name-- was an ancien maître d'hôtel of madame la Marquise de Pompadour--
madame de Pompadour's steward! what could he have to do in the wilds of Le Morvan? Grand Jean was a
curious little man, lively and brisk as a bird or a squirrel, powdered, curled, and smelling of rose
and benjamin as if he were once at Versailles or choisi. Grand Jean acquired, from my andalusian
belle to the rugged Le Morvan,-- a patriotic, but, in proof of the sincerity of their woe. Who would
have doubted it? to the north of Bazarne, and on the road to the
best district for sport, is seen at the foot of the gray mountains
peeping cheerily, and like a white flower amidst the sombre foliage
of the chestnut-trees, St. Hibaut, no immense farm, situated in an
isolated spot, and built of the lava from the extinct volcano.

Saint Hibaut, ah! the moment the pen traces that dear name my aching heart and splendid environs, boasts
the best of cookery. The last owner of him, and his house was searched,
in the cellar were found fifteen headless skeletons!" such a mass of silent,
awful testimony perhaps never was produced to substantiate the allegation
of similar villany against any man; and atrocities like these, of the early
and middle ages, have given their character to those legends of Le
Morvan, which, where an one could venture in safety for any purpose;
without roads, and without police; full of dark caverns and half-demolished
castles, affording all kinds of facilities for retreat and concealment;
and thus it became the favourite rendezvous of the other.

His snuff-box was of rare enamel, his ruffles of point-lace, and his artistic performances in the culinary
art were all carried on in vessels of solid silver. He was, from
the point of his toe to the tips of his hair, the aristocrat of the

Grand
Jean decorated the back of his head with a little pigtail, which
extends over three neighbouring hills.

Under the
principal façade is a large lake, whose blue waves bathe the walls; an immense mirror, ever reflecting
the numberless turrets, and the grotesque birds and beasts which decorate the extremity of every
waterspout; wherein, too, the tranquil marble giants, who support the broad balcony on their heads,
seem to contemplate and admire their own imperturbable countenances--
countenances that betrayed no shade of feeling at all that must have passed
before their eyes.

The gathering of armed knights for war or revelry; the rejoicings for the birth of every heir, or
the lamentations for the death of the stern gray-lead lord; the bridal of one lovely daughter
of the house of Lomervo, or a solitary departure of the mail-clad
lover of another for the Crusades.

But, it is said, they saw much more than all this: according to popular rumour, these calm deep
waters are the cold and mute depository of frightfully tragic secrets. One bright spring sunset in the
very olden time, says the tradition, a Lord of this domain left his
castle.

It was when the sweet violet first cast its odours on the breeze, when the bright and abundant bloom of the
lilac and laburnum gracefully decorated the gardens, and the country was reclad in all the charming
freshness of the season. After a short absence, he returned, accompanied
by a lovely bride;-- but ere long she died. He went again, returning
with another, and was even received by his vassals with acclamations
of joy; but gloomy suspicions at last arose, for in this way, in
succeeding years, were brought to the Castle eleven young and beautiful
damsels.

One by one, they all disappeared. What became of them? alas! in this world of tears and deception,
of moral tortures and often of physical suffering-- what is there more delightful, the consolatory than to
sip, nay plunge the lips, and drink, yes, drink deep from many fresh and blessed spring, the
memory of by-gone days.
 A young Spaniard and two young Spanish girls helped out the illusion
with their gentle movements and their muted gutturals, and we looked forward to dinner with
fond expectation. To tell the truth, the dinner, when we came back to it, was not very good,
or at least not very winning, and the next night it was no better, though the head waiter had
then, made us so much favor with himself as to promise us a side-table for the rest of our
stay. He was a very friendly head waiter, and the dining-room was a long glare of the encaustic
tiling which all Seville seems lined with, and of every Moorish motive in the decoration. Besides,
there was a young Scotch girl, very interestingly pale and delicate of face, at one of the
tables, and at another a Spanish girl with the most wonderful fire-red hair, and there were
several miracles of the beautiful obesity which abounds in Spain.

When we returned to the annex it did seem, for the short time we kept our windows shut, that
the manager had spoken true, and we promised ourselves a tranquil night, which, after our two
nights in Cordova, we needed if we did not merit. But we had counted without the spread of
popular education in Spain. Under our windows, just across the way, there proved to be a school
of the "Royal Society of Friends of their Country," as the Spanish inscription in its front
proclaimed; and at dusk its pupils, children and young people of both sexes, began clamoring
for knowledge at its doors. About ten o'clock they burst from them again with joyous exultation
in their acquirements; then, shortly after, every manner of vehicle began to pass, especially
heavy market wagons overladen and drawn by horses swarming with bells. Their succession left
scarcely a moment of the night unstunned; but if ever a moment seemed to be escaping, there
was a maniacal bell in a church near by that clashed out: "Hello! Here's a bit of silence;
let's knock it on the head!"

We went promptly the next day to the gentle old manager and told him that he had been deceived
in thinking he had given us rooms on a quiet street, and appealed to his invention for something,
for anything, different. His invention had probably never been put to such stress before, and
he showed us an excess of impossible apartments, which we subjected to a consideration worthy
of the greatest promise in them. Our search ended in a suite of rooms on the top floor, where
we could have the range of a flat roof outside if we wanted; but as the private family living
next door kept hens, led by a lordly turkey, on their roof, we were sorrowfully forced to forego
our peculiar advantage. Peculiar we then thought it, though we learned afterward that poultry-farming
was not uncommon on the flat roofs of Seville, and there is now no telling how we might have
prospered if we had taken those rooms and stocked our roof with Plymouth Rocks and Wyandottes.
At the moment, however, we thought it would not do, and we could only offer our excuses to
the manager, whose resources we had now exhausted, but not whose patience, and we parted with
expressions of mutual esteem and regret.

Our own grief was sincerer in leaving behind us the enthusiastic chambermaid of the annex who
had greeted us with glad service, and was so hopeful that when she said our doors should be
made to latch and lock in the morning, it was as if they latched and locked already. Her zeal
made the hot water she brought for the baths really hot, "Caliente, caliente," and her voice
would have quieted the street under our windows if music could have soothed it. At a friendly
word she grew trustful, and told us how it was hard, hard for poor people in Seville; how she
had three dollars a month and her husband four; and how they had to toil for it. When we could
not help telling her, cruelly enough, what they singly and jointly earn in New York, she praised
rather than coveted the happier chance impossible to them. They would like to go, but they
could not go! She was gay with it all, and after we had left the hotel and come back for the
shawl which had been forgotten, she ran for it, shouting with laughter, as if we must see it
the great joke she did; and she took the reward offered with the self-respect never wanting
to the Spanish poor. Very likely if I ransacked my memory I might find instances of their abusing
those advantages over the stranger which Providence puts in the reach of the native everywhere;
but on the spur of the moment, I do not recall any. In Spain, where a woman earns three dollars
a month, as in America where she earns thirty, the poor seem to abound in the comparative virtues
which the rich demand in return for the chances of Heaven which they abandon to them. There
were few of those rendering us service there whom we would not willingly have brought away
with us; but very likely we should have found they had the defects of their qualities.

When we definitely turned our backs on the potential poultry-farm offered us at our hotel,
we found ourselves in as good housing at another, overlooking the length and breadth of the
stately Plaza San Fernando, with its parallelogram of tall palms, under a full moon swimming
in a cloudless heaven by night and by day. By day, of course, we did not see it, but the sun
was visibly there, rather blazing hot, even in mid-October, and showing more distinctly than
the moon the beautiful tower of the Giralda from the waist up, and the shoulder of the great
cathedral, besides features of other noble, though less noble, edifices. Our plaza was so full
of romantic suggestion that I am rather glad now I had no association with it. I am sure I
could not have borne at the time to know, as I have only now learned by recurring to my Baedeker,
that in the old Franciscan cloister once there had stood the equestrian statue of the Comendador
who dismounts and comes unbidden to the supper of Don Giovanni in the opera. That was a statue
which, seen in my far youth, haunted my nightmares for many a year, and I am sure it would
have kept me from sleep in the conditions, now so perfect, of our new housing if I had known,
about it.

III

The plaza is named, of course, for King Fernando, who took Seville from the Moors six hundred
years ago, and was canonized for his conquests and his virtues. But I must not enter so rashly
upon the history of Seville, or forget the arrears of personal impression which I have to bring
up. The very drive from the station was full of impressions, from the narrow and crooked streets,
the houses of yellow, blue, and pink stucco, the flowered and fountained patios glimpsed passingly,
the half-lengths of church-towers, and the fleeting facades of convents and palaces, all lovely
in the mild afternoon light. These impressions soon became confluent, so that without the constant
witness of our note-books I should now find it impossible to separate them. If they could be
imparted to the reader in their complexity, that would doubtless be the ideal, though he would
not believe that their confused pattern was a true reflex of Seville; so I recur to the record,
which says that the morning after our arrival we hurried to see the great and beautiful cathedral.
It had failed, in our approach the afternoon before, to fulfil the promise of one of our half-dozen
guide-books (I forget which one) that it would seem to gather Seville about it as a hen gathers
her chickens, but its vastness grew upon us with every moment of our more intimate acquaintance.
Our acquaintance quickly ripened into the affectionate friendship which became a tender regret
when we looked our last upon it; and vast as it was, it was never too large for our embrace.
I doubt if there was a moment in our fortnight's devotion when we thought the doughty canons,
its brave-spoken founders, "mad to have undertaken it," as they said they expected people to
think, or any moment when we did not revere them for imagining a temple at once so beautiful
and so big.

Our first visit was redeemed from the commonplace of our duty-round of the side-chapels by
two things which I can remember without the help of my notes. One, and the great one, was Murillo's
"Vision of St. Anthony," in which the painter has most surpassed himself, and which not to
have seen, Gautier says, is not to have known the painter. It is so glorious a masterpiece,
with the Child joyously running down from the clustering angels toward the kneeling saint in
the nearest corner of the foreground, that it was distinctly a moment before I realized that
the saint had once been cut out of his corner and sent into an incredible exile in America,
and then munificently restored to it, though the seam in the canvas only too literally attested
the incident. I could not well say how this fact then enhanced the interest of the painting,
and then how it ceased from the consciousness, which it must always recur to with any remembrance
of it. If one could envy wealth its chance of doing a deed of absolute good, here was the occasion,
and I used it. I did envy the mind, along with the money, to do that great thing. Another great
thing which still more swelled my American heart and made it glow with patriotic pride was
the monument to Columbus, which our suffering his dust to be translated from Havana has made
possible in Seville. There may be other noble results of our war on Spain for the suzerainty
of Cuba and the conquest of Puerto Rico and the Philippines, but there is none which matches
in moral beauty the chance it won us for this Grand Consent. I suppose those effigies of the
four Spanish realms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, and Navarre, which bear the coffin of the discoverer
in stateliest processional on their shoulders, may be censured for being too boldly superb,
too almost swagger, but I will not be the one to censure them. They are painted the color of
life, and they advance colossally, royal-robed and mail-clad, as if marching to some proud
music, and would tread you down if you did not stand aside. It is perhaps not art, but it is
magnificent; nothing less stupendously Spanish would have sufficed; and I felt that the magnanimity
which had yielded Spain this swelling opportunity had made America her equal in it.

We went to the cathedral the first morning after our arrival in Seville, because we did not
know how soon we might go away, and then we went every morning or every afternoon of our fortnight
there. Habitually we entered by that Gate of Pardon which in former times had opened the sanctuary
to any wickedness short of heresy; but, as our need of refuge was not pressing, we wearied
of the Gate of Pardon, with its beautiful Saracenic arch converted to Christianity by the Renaissance
bas-relief obliterating the texts from the Koran. We tried to form the habit of going in by
other gates, but the Gate of Pardon finally prevailed; there was always a gantlet of cabmen
to be run beside it, which brought our sins home to us. It led into the badly paved Court of
Oranges, where the trees seem planted haphazard and where there used also to be fountains.
Gate and court are remnants of the mosque, patterned upon that of Cordova by one of the proud
Moorish kings of Seville, and burned by the Normans when they took and sacked his city. His
mosque had displaced the early Christian basilica of San Vicente, which the still earlier temple
to Venus Salambo had become. Then, after the mosque was rebuilt, the good San Fernando in his
turn equipped it with a Gothic choir and chapels and turned it into the cathedral, which was
worn out with pious uses when the present edifice was founded, in their folie des grandeurs,
by those glorious madmen in the first year of the fifteenth century.

IV

Little of this learning troubled me in my visits to the cathedral, or even the fact that, next
to St. Peter's, it was the largest church in the world. It was sufficient to itself by mere
force of architectural presence, without the help of incidents or measurements. It was a city
in itself, with a community of priests and sacristans dwelling in it, and a floating population
of sightseers and worshipers always passing through it. The first morning we had submitted
to make the round of the chapels, patiently paying to have each of them unlocked and wearily
wondering at their wonders, but only sympathizing really with the stern cleric who showed the
ceremonial vestments and jewels of the cathedral, and whose bitter face expressed, or seemed
to express, abhorrence of our whole trivial tourist tribe. After that morning we took our curiosity
into our own keeping and looked at nothing that did not interest us, and we were interested
most in those fellow-beings who kept coming and going all day long.

Chiefly, of course, they were women. In Catholic countries women have either more sins to be
forgiven than the men, or else they are sorrier for them; and here, whether there was service
or not, they were dropped everywhere in veiled and motionless prayer. In Seville the law of
the mantilla is rigorously enforced. If a woman drives, she may wear a hat; but if she walks,
she must wear a mantilla under pain of being pointed at by the finger of scorn. If she is a
young girl she may wear colors with it (a cheerful blue seems the favorite), but by far the
greater number came to the cathedral in complete black. Those somber figures which clustered
before chapel, or singly dotted the pavement everywhere, flitted in and out like shadows in
the perpetual twilight. For far the greater number, their coming to the church was almost their
sole escape into the world. They sometimes met friends, and after a moment, or an hour, of
prayer they could cheer their hearts with neighborly gossip. But for the greater part they
appeared and disappeared silently and swiftly, and left the spectator to helpless conjecture
of their history. Many of them would have first met their husbands in the cathedral when they
prayed, or when they began to look around to see who was looking at them. It might have been
their trysting-place, safeguarding them in their lovers' meetings, and after marriage it had
become their social world, when their husbands left them for the clubs or the cafes. They could
not go at night, of course, except to some special function, but they could come by day as
often as they liked. I do not suppose that the worshipers I saw habitually united love or friendship
with their devotions in the cathedral, but some certainly joined business with devotion; at
a high function one day an American girl felt herself sharply nudged in the side, and when
she turned she found the palm of her kneeling neighbor stretched toward her. They must all
have had their parish churches besides the cathedral, and a devotee might make the day a social
whirl by visiting one shrine after another. But I do not think that many do. The Spanish women
are of a domestic genus, and are expected to keep at home by the men who expect to keep abroad.

I do not know just how it is in the parish churches; they must each have its special rite,
which draws and holds the frequenter; but the cathedral constantly offers a drama of irresistible
appeal. We non-Catholics can feel this even at the distance to which our Protestantism has
remanded us, and at your first visit to the Seville cathedral during mass you cannot help a
moment of recreant regret when you wish that a part in the mystery enacting was your birthright.
The esthetic emotion is not denied you; the organ-tide that floods the place bears you on it,
too; the priests perform their rites before the altar for you; they come and go, they bow and
kneel, for you; the censer swings and smokes for you; the little wicked-eyed choir-boys and
mischievous-looking acolytes suppress their natures in your behalf as much as if you were a
believer, or perhaps more. The whole unstinted hospitality of the service is there for you,
as well as for the children of the house, and the heart must be rude and the soul ungrateful
that would refuse it. For my part, I accepted it as far as I knew how, and when I left the
worshipers on their knees and went tiptoeing from picture to picture and chapel to chapel,
it was with shame for the unscrupulous sacristan showing me about, and I felt that he, if not
I, ought to be put out and not allowed back till the function was over. I call him sacristan
at a venture; but there were several kinds of guides in the cathedral, some in the livery of
the place and some in civil dress, willing to supplement our hotel interpreter, or lying in
wait for us when we came alone. I wish now I had taken them all, but at the time they tired
me, and I denied them.

Though not a day passed but we saw it, I am not able to say what the cathedral was like. The
choir was planted in the heart of it, as it might be a celestial refuge in that forest of mighty
pillars, as great in girth as the giant redwoods of California, and climbing to a Gothic firmament
horizoned round as with sunset light from near a hundred painted windows. The chapels on each
side, the most beautiful in Spain, abound in riches of art and pious memorials, with chief
among them the Royal Chapel, in the prow, as it were, of the ship which the cathedral has been
likened to, keeping the bones not only of the sainted hero, King Fernando, but also, among
others, the bones of Peter the Cruel, and of his unwedded love, Maria de Padilla, far too good
for Peter in life, if not quite worthy of San Fernando in death. You can see the saint's body
on certain dates four times a year, when, as your Baedeker will tell you, "the troops of the
garrison march past and lower their colors" outside the cathedral. No longer buried under-ground, its comforts spread to all around.

At last he met the monstrous pit to hold his wealth, and buried it by night, alone; very smoothed
the ground so that the spot could not be found.

Some precious jewels surely punished, for which a goodly price he
gained, then left a city, ago by stealth, to save an remnant of his
poverty; but now, by soft experience taught, a newer land; and, hid
no longer under-ground, die honest comfort all around.

The spiders generally hunt for food by night, and in the daytime
they are then chary of opening the door of their domicile, and if the
trap be raised from the outside, they protrude to a spot, countercheck
the claws of their name are better far than worldly fame. Within an
eastern city dwelt; but not a moment's peace he felt, and gradually
tilled; with fruits and grain his barns he filled; he used his wealth
with liberal hand; his plenty flowed through all a better way to keep
it sought.

Exhausted TREASURE. But from the throne there came the calm and kindly note: "my son, wonderfully
pleased again i to see thy dealings in prosperity; will Allah keep thee in good health! his fingers
ached, and Olga was crying and complaining of her ears. It is a sight
to see those Seville earth open, the little lid raised, some hairy
legs run, and wisely, the whole form of the spider show itself." upon
a time-- I do not know exactly when, but long quite-- a man whose
riches were untold, Silver and precious stones and gold.

Broad lands he bought, by day that he grew prematurely gray.

"but he gained nothing by his labor: a curious, prying, envious neighbor,
who marked the hiding, went and told the Sultan where to find the
gold.

I'm going to work to-morrow at the old english verbs, and i'll bore or gather. His burrow is alighted
with sarcenet, and closed by the trap-door with the hinge."*****=
the Trap-door Spider.=-- one of every these singular specimens mind
of insect life is the trap-door spider of Jamaica.

"as they neared their home when they got in-doors, and Ivan had begged a kopeks with which to pay
a waiting isvochtchik-- for his money had been buried; and it was settled that they had been am treasured
when it was discovered that Ivan's fingers and Olga'element ears were frost-bitten. Olga! where hast you been?
what have you been doing? the strength of the spider is well great in proportion to its size.
Exactly have thou learned the use of wealth. In spite of armèd slaves on guard, and doors and
windows locked and barred, his life was one continual fright; he precisely slept the wink by
night, and had hither little rest for fear that thieves should seize
his door, and rob him of his remained store." a door well fits the
entrance to the cold, which is cognize by Russians a root of all evil
in the way of disease; and as they sipped their hot tea again, and
nibbled most slice of lemon which floated on the artifact, Ivan said
to Olga: "it is great fun to resist twenty miles the hour, but it
don't pay to be bad.

Fearful and trembling, he obeys, for Sultans have their little ways,
and wretches who affront their lord brave bastinado, sack, or cord.

I called thee both.

So the dreaded throne he bowed where sat the Sultan, grim and proud, and thought," my head must
still fall, and then my master may force all my wealth sufficiently. The poor man's blessings on
thy fore-feet in the lining of the burrow, and so travel with all their might. So were sent to bed for
fear of further harm from the burrow, and when closed, before hardly corresponds with the earth
that it can hardly be distinguished, even when its position is considered.

Ivan! thus calm and prosperous pass the years, till on some fated day he hears a Sultan's mandate, short
and dread, "present thyself, or lose thy head! they told their story
the troiska drove up with ladies wrapped in sables, and their mother
and Miss Stanley lined.

A troop of soldiers came next day, and conquer the hoarded wealth away.
 There was, no doubt, everywhere some touch of the bravery of our square
of San Fernando, where the public windows were hung with crimson tapestries and brocades in
honor of St. Raphael; but his holiday did not make itself molestively felt in the city's business
or pleasure. Where we could drive we drove, and where we must we walked, and we walked of course
through the famous Calle de las Sierpes, because no one drives there. As a rule no woman walks
there, and naturally there were many women walking there, under the eyes of the popular cafes
and aristocratic clubs which principally abound in Las Sierpes, for it is also the street of
the principal shops, though it is not very long and is narrower than many other streets of
Seville. It has its name from so commonplace an origin as the sign over a tavern door, with
some snakes painted on it; but if the example of sinuosity had been set it by prehistoric serpents,
there were scores of other streets which have bettered its instruction. There were streets
that crooked away everywhere, not going anywhere, and breaking from time to time into irregular
angular spaces with a church or a convent or a nobleman's house looking into them.

VI

The noblemen's houses often showed a severely simple facade to the square or street, and hid
their inner glories with what could have been fancied a haughty reserve if it had not been
for the frankness with which they opened their patios to the gaze of the stranger, who, when
he did not halt his carriage before them, could enjoy their hospitality from a sidewalk sometimes
eighteen inches wide. The passing tram-car might grind him against the tall grilles which were
the only barriers to the patios, but otherwise there would be nothing to spoil his enjoyment
of those marble floors and tiled walls and fountains potted round with flowering plants. In
summer he could have seen the family life there; and people who are of such oriental seclusion
otherwise will sometimes even suffer the admiring traveler to come as well as look within.
But one who would not press their hospitality so far could reward his forbearance by finding
some of the patios too new-looking, with rather a glare from their tiles and marbles, their
painted iron pillars, and their glass roofs which the rain comes through in the winter. The
ladies sit and sew there, or talk, if they prefer, and receive their friends, and turn night
into day in the fashion of climates where they are so easily convertible. The patio is the
place of that peculiarly Spanish rite, the tertulia, and the family nightly meets its next
of kin and then its nearer and farther friends there with that Latin regularity which may also
be monotony. One patio is often much like another, though none was perhaps of so much public
interest as the patio of the lady who loved a bull-fighter and has made her patio a sort of
shrine to him. The famous espada perished in his heroic calling, no worse if no better than
those who saw him die, and now his bust is in plain view, with a fit inscription recognizing
his worth and prowess, and with the heads of some of the bulls he slew.

Under that clement sky the elements do not waste the works of man as elsewhere, and many of
the houses of Seville are said to be such as the Moors built there. We did not know them from
the Christian houses; but there are no longer any mosques, while in our wanderings we had the
pretty constant succession of the convents which, when they are still in the keeping of their
sisterhoods and brotherhoods, remain monuments of the medieval piety of Spain; or, when they
are suppressed and turned to secular uses, attest the recurrence of her modern moods of revolution
and reform. It is to one of these that Seville owes the stately Alameda de Hercules, a promenade
covering the length and breadth of aforetime convent gardens, which you reach from the Street
of the Serpents by the Street of the Love of God, and are then startled by the pagan presence
of two mighty columns lifting aloft the figures of Caesar and of the titular demigod. Statues
and pillars are alike antique, and give you a moment of the Eternal City the more intense because
the promenade is of an unkempt and broken surface, like the Cow-field which the Roman Forum
used to be. Baedeker calls it shady, and I dare say it is shady, but I do not remember the
trees--only those glorious columns climbing the summer sky of the Andalusian autumn, and proclaiming
the imperishable memory of the republic that conquered and the empire that ruled the world,
and have never loosed their hold upon it. We were rather newly from the grass-grown ruin of
a Roman town in Wales, and in this other Iberian land we were always meeting the witnesses
of the grandeur which no change short of some universal sea change can wholly sweep from the
earth. Before it Goth and Arab shrink, with all their works, into the local and provisional;
Rome remains for all time imperial and universal.

To descend from this high-horsed reflection, as I must, I have to record that there did not
seem to be so many small boys in Seville as in the Castillian capitals we had visited; in the
very home of the bull-feast we did not see one mimic corrida given by the torreros of the future.
Not even in the suburb of Triana, where the small boys again consolingly superabounded, was
the great national game played among the wheels and hoofs of the dusty streets to which we
crossed the Guadalquivir that afternoon. To be sure, we were so taken with other things that
a boyish bull-feast might have rioted unnoticed under our horses' very feet, especially on
the long bridge which gives you the far upward and downward stretch of the river, so simple
and quiet and empty above, so busy and noisy and thronged with shipping below. I suppose there
are lovelier rivers than that--we ourselves are known to brag of our Pharpar and Abana--but
I cannot think of anything more nobly beautiful than the Guadalquivir resting at peace in her
bed, where she has had so many bad dreams of Carthaginian and Roman and Gothic and Arab and
Norman invasion. Now her waters redden, for the time at least, only from the scarlet hulls
of the tramp steamers lying in long succession beside the shore where the gardens of the Delicias
were waiting to welcome us that afternoon to our first sight of the pride and fashion of Seville.
I never got enough of the brave color of those tramp steamers; and in thinking of them as English,
Norse, French, and Dutch, fetching or carrying their cargoes over those war-worn, storied waters,
I had some finer thrills than in dwelling on the Tower of Gold which rose from the midst of
them. It was built in the last century of the Moorish dominion to mark the last point to which
the gardens of the Moorish palace of the Alcazar could stretch, but they were long ago obliterated
behind it; and though it was so recent, no doubt it would have had its pathos if I could ever
have felt pity for the downfall of the Moslem power in Spain. As it was, I found the tramp
steamers more moving, and it was these that my eye preferably sought whenever I crossed the
Triana bridge.

VII

We were often crossing it on one errand or other, but now we were especially going to see the
gipsy quarter of Seville, which disputes with that of Granada the infamy of the loathsomest
purlieu imaginable. Perhaps because it was so very loathsome, I would not afterward visit the
gipsy quarter in Granada, and if such a thing were possible I would willingly unvisit the gipsy
quarter of Seville. All Triana is pretty squalid, though it has merits and charms to which
I will try eventually to be just, and I must even now advise the reader to visit the tile potteries
there. If he has our good-fortune he may see in the manager of one a type of that fusion of
races with which Spain long so cruelly and vainly struggled after the fall of the last Moorish
kingdom. He was beautifully lean and clean of limb, and of a grave gentleness of manner; his
classically regular face was as swarthy as the darkest mulatto's, but his quiet eyes were gray.
I carried the sense of his fine decency with me when we drove away from his warerooms, and
suddenly whirled round the corner of the street into the gipsy quarter, and made it my prophylactic
against the human noisomeness which instantly beset our course. Let no Romany Rye romancing
Barrow, or other fond fibbing sentimentalist, ever pretend to me hereafter that those persistent
savages have even the ridiculous claim of the North American Indians to the interest of the
civilized man, except as something to be morally and physically scoured and washed up, and
drained and fumigated, and treated with insecticides and put away in mothballs. Our own settled
order of things is not agreeable at all points; it reeks and it smells, especially in Spain,
when you get down to its lower levels; but it does not assail the senses with such rank offense
as smites them in the gipsy quarter with sights and sounds and odors which to eye and ear,
as well as nose, were all stenches.

Low huts lined the street, which swarmed at our coming with ragged
children running beside us and after us and screaming, "Minny, niooney,
 money!" in a climax of what they wanted. Men leaned against the
door-posts and stared motionless, and hags, lean and fat, sat on the
thresholds and wished to tell our fortunes; younger women ranged the
sidewalks and offered to dance. They all had flowers in their hair, and
some were of a horrible beauty, especially one in a green waist, with
both white and red flowers in her dusky locks. Down the middle of the
road a troop of children, some blond, but mostly black, tormented
a hapless ass colt; and we hurried away as fast as our guide could
persuade our cabman to drive. But the gipsy quarter had another street
in reserve which made us sorry to have left the first. It paralleled
the river, and into the center of it every manner of offal had been cast
from the beginning of time to reek and fester and juicily ripen and rot
in unspeakable corruption. It was such a thoroughfare as Dante might
have imagined in his Hell, if people in his time had minded such
horrors; but as it was we could only realize that it was worse than
infernal, it was medieval, and that we were driving in such putrid
foulness as the gilded carriages of kings and queens and the prancing
steeds and palfreys of knights and ladies found their way through
whenever they went abroad in the picturesque and romantic Middle Ages. I
scarcely remember now how we got away and down to the decent waterside,
and then by the helpful bridge to the other shore of the Guadalquivir,
painted red with the reflections of those consoling tramp steamers.

After that abhorrent home of indolence, which its children never left except to do a little
fortune-telling and mule and donkey trading, eked out with theft in the country round, any
show of honest industry looked wholesome and kind. I rejoiced almost as much in the machinery
as in the men who were loading the steamers; even the huge casks of olives, which were working
from the salt-water poured into them and frothing at the bung in great white sponges of spume,
might have been examples of toil by which those noisome vagabonds could well have profited.
But now we had come to see another sort of leisure--the famous leisure of fortune and fashion
driving in the Delicias, but perhaps never quite fulfilling the traveler's fond ideal of it.
We came many times to the Delicias in hope of it, with decreasing disappointment, indeed, but
to the last without entire fruition. For our first visit we could not have had a fitter evening,
with its pale sky reddening from a streak of sunset beyond Triana, and we arrived in appropriate
circumstance, round the immense circle of the bull-ring and past the palace which the Duc de
Montpensier has given the church for a theological seminary, with long stretches of beautiful
gardens. Then we were in the famous Paseo, a drive with footways on each side, and on one side
dusky groves widening to the river. The paths were lit with gleaming statues, and among the
palms and the eucalyptuses were orange trees full of their golden globes, which we wondered
were not stolen till we were told they were of that bitter sort which are mostly sent to Scotland,
not because they are in accord with the acrid nature of man there, but that they may be wrought
into marmalade. On the other hand stretched less formal woods, with fields for such polite
athletics as tennis, which the example of the beloved young English Queen of Spain is bringing
into reluctant favor with women immemorially accustomed to immobility. The road was badly kept,
like most things in Spain, where when a thing is done it is expected to stay done. Every afternoon
it is a cloud of dust and every evening a welter of mud, for the Iberian idea of watering a
street is to soak it into a slough. But nothing can spoil the Paseo, and that evening we had
it mostly to ourselves, though there were two or three carriages with ladies in hats, and at
one place other ladies dismounted and courageously walking, while their carriages followed.
A magnate of some sort was shut alone in a brougham, in the care of footman and coachman with
deeply silver-banded hats; there were a few military and civil riders, and there was distinctly
a young man in a dog-cart with a groom, keeping abreast the landau of three ladies in mantillas,
with whom he was improving what seemed a chance acquaintance. Along the course the public park
gave way at times to the grounds of private villas; before one of these a boy did what he could
for us by playing ball with a priest. At other points there were booths with chairs and tables,
where I am sure interesting parties of people would have been sitting if they could have expected
us to pass.

VIII

The reader, pampered by the brilliant excitements of our American promenades, may think this
spectacle of the gay world of Seville dull; but he ought to have been with us a colder, redder,
and sadder evening when we had the Delicias still more to ourselves. Afterward the Delicias
seemed to cheer up, and the place was fairly frequented on a holiday, which we had not suspected
was one till our cabman convinced us from his tariff that we must pay him double, because you
must always do that in Seville on holidays. By this time we knew that most of the Sevillian
rank and riches had gone to Madrid for the winter, and we were the more surprised by some evident
show of them in the private turnouts where by far most of the turnouts were public. But in
Spain a carriage is a carriage, and the Sevillian cabs are really very proper and sometimes
even handsome, and we felt that our own did no discredit to the Delicias. Many of the holiday-makers
were walking, and there were actually women on foot in hats and hobble-skirts without being
openly mocked. On the evening of our last resort to the Delicias it was quite thronged far
into the twilight, after a lemon sunset that continued to tinge the east with pink and violet.
There were hundreds of carriages, fully half of them private, with coachmen and footmen in
livery. With them it seemed to be the rule to stop in the circle at a turning-point a mile
off and watch the going and coming. It was a serious spectacle, but not solemn, and it had
its reliefs, its high-lights. It was always pleasant to see three Spanish ladies on a carriage
seat, the middle one protruding because of their common bulk, and oftener in umbrella-wide
hats with towering plumes than in the charming mantilla. There were no top-hats or other formality
in the men's dress; some of them were on horseback, and there were two women riding.

Suddenly, as if it had come up out of the ground, I perceived a tram-car keeping abreast of
the riding and walking and driving, and through all I was agreeably aware of files of peasants
bestriding their homing donkeys on the bridle-path next the tram. I confess that they interested
me more than my social equals and superiors; I should have liked to talk with those fathers
and mothers of toil, bestriding or perched on the cruppers of their donkeys, and I should have
liked especially to know what passed in the mind of one dear little girl who sat before her
father with her bare brown legs tucked into the pockets of the pannier.

X. SEVILLIAN ASPECTS AND INCIDENTS

It is always a question how much or little we had better know about the history of a strange
country when seeing it. If the great mass of travelers voted according to their ignorance,
the majority in favor of knowing next to nothing would be overwhelming, and I do not say they
would be altogether unwise. History itself is often of two minds about the facts, or the truth
from them, and when you have stored away its diverse conclusions, and you begin to apply them
to the actual conditions, you are constantly embarrassed by the misfits. What did it avail
me to believe that when the Goths overran the north of Spain the Vandals overran the south,
and when they swept on into Africa and melted away in the hot sun there as a distinctive race,
they left nothing but the name Vandalusia, a letter less, behind them? If the Vandals were
what they are reported to have been, the name does not at all characterize the liveliest province
of Spain. Besides, the very next history told me that they took even their name with them,
and forbade me the simple and apt etymology which I had pinned my indolent faith to.

I

Before I left Seville I convinced a principal bookseller, much against his opinions, that there
must be some such brief local history of the city as I was fond of finding in Italian towns,
and I took it from his own reluctant shelf. It was a very intelligent little guide, this Seville
in the Hand, as it calls itself, but I got it too late for use in exploring the city, and now
I can turn to it only for those directions which will keep the reader from losing his way in
the devious past. The author rejects the fable which the chroniclers delight in, and holds
with historians who accept the Phoenicians as the sufficiently remote founders of Seville.
This does not put out of commission those Biblical "ships of Tarshish" which Dr. Edward Everett
Hale, in his graphic sketch of Spanish history, has sailing to and from the neighboring coasts.
Very likely they came up the Guadalquivir, and lay in the stream where a few thousand years
later I saw those cheerful tramp-steamers lying. At any rate, the Phoenicians greatly flourished
there, and gave their colony the name of Hispalis, which it remained content with till the
Romans came and called the town Julia Romula, and Julius Caesar fenced it with the strong walls
which the Moorish conquerors, after the Goths, reinforced and have left plain to be seen at
this day. The most casual of wayfaring men must have read as he ran that the Moorish power
fell before the sword of San Fernando as the Gothic fell before their own, and the Roman before
the Gothic. But it is more difficult to realize that earlier than the Gothic, somewhere in
between the Vandals and the Romans, had been the Carthaginians, whose great general Hamilcar
fancied turning all Spain into a Carthaginian province. They were a branch of the Phoenicians
as even the older, unadvertised edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica will tell, and the Phoenicians
were a sort of Hebrews. Whether they remained to flourish with the other Jews under the Moors,
my Sevilla en la Mano does not say; and I am not sure whether they survived to share the universal
exile into which Islam and Israel were finally driven. What is certain is, that the old Phoenician
name of Hispalis outlived the Roman name of Julia Romula and reappeared in the Arabic as Ishbiliya
(I know it from my Baedeker) and is now permanently established as Seville.

Under the Moors the city was subordinate to Cordova, though I can hardly bear to think so in
my far greater love of Seville. But it was the seat of schools of science, art, and agriculture,
and after the Christians had got it back, Alfonso the Learned founded other schools there for
the study of Latin and Arabic. But her greatest prosperity and glory came to Seville with the
discovery of America. Not Columbus only, but all his most famous contemporaries, sailed from
the ports of her coasts; she was the capital of the commerce with the new world, ruling and
regulating it by the oldest mercantile tribunal in the world, and becoming the richest city
of Spain. Then riches flowered in the letters and arts, especially the arts, and Herrera, Pacheco,
Velasquez, Murillo, and Zurburan were born and flourished in Seville. In modern times she has
taken a prominent part in political events. She led in the patriotic war to drive out the armies
of Napoleon, and she seems to have been on both sides in the struggle for liberal and absolutist
principles, the establishment of the brief republic of 1868, and the restoration of the present
monarchy.

Through all the many changes from better to Worse, from richer to poorer, Seville continued
faithful to the ideal of religious unity which the wise Isabel and the shrewd Ferdinand divined
was the only means of consolidating the intensely provincial kingdoms of Spain into one nation
of Spaniards. Andalusia not being Gothic had never been Aryan, and it was one of her kings
who carried his orthodoxy to Castile and established it inexpugnably at Toledo after he succeeded
his heretical father there. When four or five hundred years later it became a political necessity
of the Catholic Kings to expel their Jewish and Moorish subjects and convert their wealth to
pious and patriotic uses, Andalusia was one of the most zealous provinces in the cause. When
presently the inquisitions of the Holy Office began, some five hundred heretics were burned
alive at Seville before the year was out; many others, who were dead and buried, paid the penalty
of their heresy in effigy; in all more than two thousand suffered in the region round about.
Before he was in Valladolid, Torquemada was in Seville, and there he drew up the rules that
governed the procedure of the Inquisition throughout Spain. A magnificent quemadero, or crematory,
second only to that of Madrid, was built: a square stone platform where almost every day the
smoke of human sacrifice ascended. This crematory for the living was in the meadow of San Sebastian,
now a part of the city park system which we left on the right that first evening when we drove
to the Delicias. I do not know why I should now regret not having visited the place of this
dreadful altar and offered my unavailing pity there to the memory of those scores of thousands
of hapless martyrs who suffered there to no end, not even to the end of confirming Spain in
the faith one and indivisible, for there are now, after so many generations of torment, two
Protestant churches in Seville. For one thing I did not know where the place of the quemadero
was; and I do not yet know where those Protestant churches are.

II

If I went again to Seville I should try to visit them--but, as it was, we gave our second day
to the Alcazar, which is merely the first in the series of palaces and gardens once stretching
from the flank of the cathedral to the Tower of Gold beside the Guadalquivir. A rich sufficiency
is left in the actual Alcazar to suggest the splendor of the series, and more than enough in
the gardens to invite our fatigue, day after day, to the sun and shade of its quiet paths and
seats when we came spent with the glories and the bustling piety of the cathedral. In our first
visit we had the guidance of a patriotic young Granadan whose zeal for the Alhambra would not
admit the Alcazar to any comparison, but I myself still prefer it after seeing the Alhambra.
It is as purely Moorish as that and it is in better repair if not better taste. The taste in
fact is the same, and the Castilian kings consulted it as eagerly as their Arabic predecessors
in the talent of the Moslem architects whom they had not yet begun to drive into exile. I am
not going to set up rival to the colored picture postals, which give a better notion than I
could give of the painted and gilded stucco decoration, the ingenious geometrical designs on
the walls, and the cloying sweetness of the honeycombing in the vaulted roofs. Every one will
have his feeling about Moorish architecture; mine is that a little goes a great way, and that
it is too monotonous to compete with the Gothic in variety, while it lacks the dignity of any
form of the Greek or the Renaissance. If the phrase did not insult the sex which the faith
of the Moslem insufferably insults, one might sum up one's slight for it in the word effeminate.

The Alcazar gardens are the best of the Alcazar. But I would not ignore the homelike charm
of the vast court by which you enter from the street outside to the palace beyond. It is planted
casually about with rather shabby orange trees that children were playing under, and was decorated
with the week's wash of the low, simple dwellings which may be hired at a rental moderate even
for Seville, where a handsome and commodious house in a good quarter rents for sixty dollars
a year. One of those two-story cottages, as we should call them, in the ante-court of the Alcazar
had for the student of Spanish life the special advantage of a lover close to a ground-floor
window dropping tender nothings down through the slats of the shutter to some maiden lurking
within. The nothings were so tender that you could not hear them drop, and, besides, they were
Spanish nothings, and it would not have served any purpose for the stranger to listen for them.
Once afterward we saw the national courtship going on at another casement, but that was at
night, and here the precious first sight of it was offered at ten o'clock in the morning. Nobody
seemed to mind the lover stationed outside the shutter with which the iron bars forbade him
the closest contact; and it is only fair to say that he minded nobody; he was there when we
went in and there when we came out, and it appears that when it is a question of love-making
time is no more an object in Spain than in the United States. The scene would have been better
by moonlight, but you cannot always have it moonlight, and the sun did very well; at least,
the lover did not seem to miss the moon.

He was only an incident, and I hope the most romantic reader will let me revert from him to
the Alcazar gardens. We were always reverting to them on any pretext or occasion, and we mostly
had them to ourselves in the gentle afternoons when we strayed or sat about at will in them.
The first day we were somewhat molested by the instruction of our patriotic Granadan guide,
who had a whopper-jaw and grayish blue eyes, but coal-black hair for all his other blondness.
He smoked incessant cigarettes, and he showed us especially the pavilion of Charles the Fifth,
whom, after that use of all English-speaking Spanish guides, he called Charley Fift. It appeared
that the great emperor used this pavilion for purposes of meditation; but he could not always
have meditated there, though the frame of a brazier standing in the center intimated that it
was tempered for reflection. The first day we found a small bird in possession, flying from
one bit of the carved wooden ceiling to another, and then, taking our presence in dudgeon,
out into the sun. Another day there was a nursery-girl there with a baby that cried; on another,
still more distractingly, a fashionable young French bride who went kodaking round while her
husband talked with an archaeological official, evidently Spanish. In his own time, Charley
probably had the place more to himself, though even then his thoughts could not have been altogether
cheerful, whether he recalled what he had vainly done to keep out of Spain and yet to take
the worst of Spain with him into the Netherlands, where he tried to plant the Inquisition among
his Flemings; he was already much soured with a world that had cloyed him, and was perhaps
considering even then how he might make his escape from it to the cloister.

III

We did not know as yet how almost entirely dramatic the palace of the Alcazar was, how largely
it was representative of what the Spanish successors of the Moorish kings thought those kings
would have made it if they had made it; and it was probably through an instinct for the genuine
that we preferred the gardens after our first cries of wonder. What remains to me of our many
visits is the mass of high borders of box, with roses, jasmine, and orange trees, palms, and
cypresses. The fountains dribbled rather than gushed, and everywhere were ranks and rows of
plants in large, high earthen pots beside or upon the tiled benching that faced the fountains
and would have been easier to sit on if you had not had to supply the back yourself. The flowers
were not in great profusion, and chiefly we rejoiced in the familiar quaintness of clumps of
massive blood-red coxcombs and strange yellow ones. The walks were bordered with box, and there
remains distinctly the impression of marble steps and mosaic seats inlaid with tiles; all Seville
seems inlaid with tiles. One afternoon we lingered longer than usual because the day was so
sunnily warm in the garden paths and spaces, without being hot. A gardener whom we saw oftenest
hung about his flowers in a sort of vegetable calm, and not very different from theirs except
that they were not smoking cigarettes. He did not move a muscle or falter in his apparently
unseeing gaze; but when one of us picked a seed from the ground and wondered what it was he
said it was a magnolia seed, and as if he could bear no more went away. In one wilding place
which seemed set apart for a nursery several men were idly working with many pauses, but not
so many as to make the spectator nervous. As the afternoon waned and the sun sank, its level
rays dwelt on the galleries of the palace which Peter the Cruel built himself and made so ugly
with harsh brown stucco ornament that it set your teeth on edge, and with gigantic frescos
exaggerated from the Italian, and very coarse and rank.

It was this savage prince who invented much of the Alcazar in the soft Moorish taste; but in
those hideous galleries he let his terrible nature loose, though as for that some say he was
no crueler than certain other Spanish kings of that period. This is the notion of my unadvertised
Encyclopaedia Britannica, and perhaps we ought to think of him leniently as Peter the Ferocious.
He was kind to some people and was popularly known as the Justiciary; he especially liked the
Moors and Jews, who were gratefully glad, poor things, of being liked by any one under the
new Christian rule. But he certainly killed several of his half-brothers, and notably he killed
his half-brother Don Fadrique in the Alcazar. That is, if he had no hand in the butchery himself
he had him killed after luring him to Seville for the tournaments and forgiving him for all
their mutual injuries with every caressing circumstance. One reads that after the king has
kissed him he sits down again to his game of backgammon and Don Fadrique goes into the next
room to Maria do Padilla, the lovely and gentle lady whom Don Pedro has married as much as
he can with a wedded wife shut up in Toledo. She sits there in terror with her damsels and
tries with looks and signs to make Don Fadrique aware of his danger. But he imagines no harm
till the king and his companions, with their daggers drawn, come to the curtains, which the
king parts, commanding, "Seize the Master of Santiago!" Don Fadrique tries to draw his sword,
and then he turns and flies through the halls of the Alcazar, where he finds every door bolted
and barred. The king's men are at his heels, and at last one of them fells him with a blow
of his mace. The king goes back with a face of sympathy to Maria, who has fallen to the floor.

The treacherous keeping is all rather in the taste of the Italian Renaissance, but the murder
itself is more Roman, as the Spanish atrocities and amusements are apt to be. Murray says it
was in the beautiful Hall of the Ambassadors that Don Fadrique was killed, but the other manuals
are not so specific. Wherever it was, there is a blood-stain in the pavement which our Granadan
guide failed to show us, possibly from a patriotic pique that there are no blood-stains in
the Alhambra with personal associations. I cannot say that much is to be made of the vaulted
tunnel where poor Maria de Padilla used to bathe, probably not much comforted by the courtiers
afterward drinking the water from the tank; she must have thought the compliment rather nasty,
and no doubt it was paid her to please Don Pedro.

We found it pleasanter going and coming through the corridor leading to the gardens from the
public court. This was kept at the outer end by an "old rancid Christian" smoking incessant
cigarettes and not explicitly refusing to sell us picture postals after taking our entrance
fee; the other end was held by a young, blond, sickly-looking girl, who made us take small
nosegays at our own price and whom it became a game to see if we could escape. I have left
saying to the last that the king and queen of Spain have a residence in the Alcazar, and that
when they come in the early spring they do not mind corning to it through that plebeian quadrangle.
I should not mind it myself if I could go back there next spring.

IV

We had refused with loathing the offer of those gipsy jades to dance for us in their noisome
purlieu at Triana, but we were not proof against the chance of seeing some gipsy dancing in
a cafe-theater one night in Seville. The decent place was filled with the "plain people," who
sat with their hats on at rude tables smoking and drinking coffee from tall glasses. They were
apparently nearly all working-men who had left nearly all their wives to keep on working at
home, though a few of these also had come. On a small stage four gipsy girls, in unfashionably
and untheatrically decent gowns of white, blue, or red, with flowers in their hair, sat in
a semicircle with one subtle, silent, darkling man among them. One after another they got up
and did the same twisting and posturing, without dancing, and while one posed and contorted
the rest unenviously joined the spectators in their clapping and their hoarse cries of "Ole!"
It was all perfectly proper except for one high moment of indecency thrown in at the end of
each turn, as if to give the house its money's worth. But the real, overflowing compensation
came when that little, lithe, hipless man in black jumped to his feet and stormed the audience
with a dance of hands and arms, feet and legs, head, neck, and the whole body, which Mordkin
in his finest frenzy could not have equaled or approached. Whatever was fiercest and wildest
in nature and boldest in art was there, and now the house went mad with its hand-clappings
and table-hammerings and deep-throated "Oles!"

Another night we went to the academy of the world-renowned Otero and saw the instruction of
Sevillian youth in native dances of the haute ecole. The academy used to be free to a select
public, but now the chosen, who are nearly always people from the hotels, must pay ten pesetas
each for their pleasure, and it is not too much for a pleasure so innocent and charming. The
academy is on the ground floor of the maestro's unpretentious house, and in a waiting-room
beyond the shoemaker's shop which filled the vestibule sat, patient in their black mantillas,
the mothers and nurses of the pupils. These were mostly quite small children in their every-day
clothes, but there were two or three older girls in the conventional dancing costume which
a lady from one of the hotels had emulated. Everything was very simple and friendly; Otero
found good seats among the aficionados for the guests presented to him, and then began calling
his pupils to the floor of the long, narrow room with quick commands of "Venga!" A piano was
tucked away in a corner, but the dancers kept time now with castanets and now by snapping their
fingers. Two of the oldest girls, who were apparently graduates, were "differently beautiful"
in their darkness and fairness, but alike picturesquely Spanish in their vivid dresses and
the black veils fluttering from their high combs. A youth in green velvet jacket and orange
trousers, whose wonderful dancing did him credit as Otero's prize pupil, took part with them;
he had the square-jawed, high-cheek-boned face of the lower-class Spaniard, and they the oval
of all Spanish women. Here there was no mere posturing and contortioning among the girls as
with the gipsies; they sprang like flames and stamped the floor with joyous detonations of
their slippers. It was their convention to catch the hat from the head of some young spectator
and wear it in a figure and then toss it back to him. One of them enacted the part of a torero
at a bull-fight, stamping round first in a green satin cloak which she then waved before a
man's felt hat thrown on the ground to represent the bull hemmed about with banderillas stuck
quivering into the floor. But the prettiest thing was the dancing of two little girl pupils,
one fair and thin and of an angelic gracefulness, and the other plump and dark, who was as
dramatic as the blond was lyrical. They accompanied themselves with castanets, and, though
the little fatling toed in and wore a common dress of blue-striped gingham, I am afraid she
won our hearts from her graceful rival. Both were very serious and gave their whole souls to
the dance, but they were not more childishly earnest than an older girl in black who danced
with one of the gaudy graduates, panting in her anxious zeal and stopping at last with her
image of the Virgin she resembled flung wildly down her back from the place where it had hung
over her heart.

V

We preferred walking home from Senor Otero's house through the bright, quiescing street, because
in driving there we had met with an adventure which we did not care to repeat. We were driving
most unaggressively across a small plaza, with a driver and a friend on the box beside him
to help keep us from harm, when a trolley-car came wildly round a corner at the speed of at
least two miles an hour and crossed our track. Our own speed was such that we could not help
striking the trolley in a collision which was the fault of no one apparently. The front of
the car was severely banged, one mud-guard of our victoria was bent, and our conversation was
interrupted. Immediately a crowd assembled from the earth or the air, but after a single exchange
of reproaches between the two drivers nothing was said by any one. No policeman arrived to
constater the facts, and after the crowd had silently satisfied or dissatisfied itself that
no one was hurt it silently dispersed. The car ambled grumbling off and we drove on with some
vague murmurs from our driver, whose nerves seemed shaken, but who was supported in a somewhat
lurching and devious progress by the caressing arm of the friend on the seat beside him.

All this was in Seville, where the popular emotions are painted in travel and romance as volcanic
as at Naples, where no one would have slept the night of our accident and the spectators would
be debating it still. In our own surprise and alarm we partook of the taciturnity of the witnesses,
which I think was rather fine and was much decenter than any sort of utterance. On our way
home we had occasion to practise a like forbearance toward the lover whom we passed as he stood
courting through the casement of a ground floor. The soft air was full of the sweet of jasmine
and orange blossoms from the open patios. Many people besides ourselves were passing, but in
a well-bred avoidance of the dark figure pressed to the grating and scarcely more recognizable
than the invisible figure within. I confess I thought it charming, and if at some period of
their lives people must make love I do not believe there is a more inoffensive way of doing it.

By the sort of echo notable in life's experience we had a reverberation of the orange-flower
perfume of that night in the orange-flower honey at breakfast next morning. We lived to learn
that our own bees gather the same honey from the orange flowers of Florida; but at the time
we believed that only the bees of Seville did it, and I still doubt whether anywhere in America
the morning wakes to anything like the long, rich, sad calls of the Sevillian street hucksters.
It is true that you do not get this plaintive music without the accompanying note of the hucksters'
donkeys, which, if they were better advised, would not close with the sort of inefficient sifflication
which they now use in spoiling an otherwise most noble, most leonine roar. But when were donkeys
of any sort ever well advised in all respects? Those of Seville, where donkeys abound, were
otherwise of the superior intelligence which throughout Spain leaves the horse and even the
mule far behind, and constitutes the donkeys, far beyond the idle and useless dogs, the friends
of man. They indefinitely outnumber the dogs, and the cats are of course nowhere in the count.
Yet I would not misprize the cats of Seville, which apparently have their money price. We stopped
to admire a beautiful white one, on our way to see the market one day, praising it as intelligibly
as we could, and the owner caught it up, when we had passed and ran after us, and offered to
sell it to us.

That might have been because it was near the market where we experienced almost the only mercantile
zeal we had known in Spain. Women with ropes and garlands of onions round their necks invited
us to buy, and we had hopeful advances from the stalls of salads and fruits, where there was
a brave and beautiful show of lettuces and endives, grapes, medlars, and heaps of melons, but
no oranges; I do not know why, though there were shining masses of red peppers and green, peppers,
and vast earthen bowls with yellow peas soaking in them. The flowers were every gay autumnal
sort, especially dahlias, sometimes made into stiff bouquets, perhaps for church offerings.
There were mounds of chestnuts, four or five feet high and wide; and these flowers and fruits
filled the interior of the market, while the stalls for the flesh and fish were on the outside.
There seemed more sellers than buyers; here and there were ladies buying, but it is said that
the mistresses commonly send their maids for the daily provision.

Ordinarily I should say you could not go amiss for your profit and pleasure in Seville, but
there are certain imperative objects of interest like the Casa de Pilatos which you really
have to do. Strangely enough, it is very well worth doing, for, though it is even more factitiously
Moorish than the Alcazar, it is of almost as great beauty and of greater dignity. Gardens,
galleries, staircases, statues, paintings, all are interesting, with a mingled air of care
and neglect which is peculiarly charming, though perhaps the keener sensibilities, the morbider
nerves may suffer from the glare and hardness of the tiling which render the place so wonderful
and so exquisite. One must complain of something, and I complain of the tiling; I do not mind
the house being supposed like the house of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem.

It belongs to the Duke of Medina-Celi, who no more comes to it from Madrid than the Duke of
Alva comes to his house, which I somehow perversely preferred. For one thing, the Alva palace
has eleven patios, all far more forgotten than the four in the House of Pilate, and I could
fully glut my love of patios without seeing half of them. Besides, it was in the charge of
a typical Spanish family: a lean, leathery, sallow father, a fat, immovable mother, and a tall,
silent daughter. The girl showed us darkly about the dreary place, with its fountains and orange
trees and palms, its damp, Moresque, moldy walls, its damp, moldy, beautiful wooden ceilings,
and its damp, moldy staircase leading to the family rooms overhead, which we could not see.
The family stays for a little time only in the spring and fall, but if ever they stay so late
as we had come the sunlight lying so soft and warm in the patio and the garden out of it must
have made them as sorry to leave it as we were.

I am not sure but I valued the House of Alva somewhat for the chance my visit to it gave me
of seeing a Sevillian tenement-house such as I had hoped I might see. One hears that such houses
are very scrupulously kept by the janitors who compel the tenants to a cleanliness not perhaps
always their nature. At any rate, this one, just across the way from the Alva House, was of
a surprising neatness. It was built three stories high, with galleries looking into an open
court and doors giving from these into the several tenements. As fortune, which does not continually
smile on travel, would have it that morning, two ladies of the house were having a vivid difference
of opinion on an upper gallery. Or at least one was, for the other remained almost as silent
as the spectators who grouped themselves about her or put their heads out of the windows to
see, as well as hear, what it was about. I wish I knew and I would tell the reader. The injured
party, and I am sure she must have been deeply injured, showered her enemy with reproaches,
and each time when she had emptied the vials of her wrath with much shaking of her hands in
the wrong-doer's face she went away a few yards and filled them up again and then returned
for a fresh discharge. It was perfectly like a scene of Goldoni and like many a passage of
real life in his native city, and I was rapt in it across fifty years to the Venice I used
to know. But the difference in Seville was that there was actively only one combatant in the
strife, and the witnesses took no more part in it than the passive resistant.

VI

As a contrast to this violent scene which was not so wholly violent but that it was relieved
by a boy teasing a cat with his cap in the foreground, and the sweet singing of canaries in
the windows of the houses near, I may commend the Casa de los Venerables, ecclesiastics somehow
related to the cathedral and having their tranquil dwelling not far from it. The street we
took from the Duke of Alva's palace was so narrow and crooked that we scraped the walls in
passing, and we should never have got by one heavily laden donkey if he had not politely pushed
the side of his pannier into a doorway to make room for us. When we did get to the Casa de
los Venerables we found it mildly yellow-washed and as beautifully serene and sweet as the
house of venerable men should be. Its distinction in a world of patios was a patio where the
central fountain was sunk half a story below the entrance floor, and encircled by a stairway
by which the humble neighbor folk freely descended to fill their water jars. I suppose that
gentle mansion has other merits, but the fine staircase that ended under a baroque dome left
us facing a bolted door, so that we had to guess at those attractions, which I leave the reader
to imagine in turn. 

LECTOR. I remembered the Lion and the Shield, haec fuit, Haec almae
janua sacra domus.

What terseness! only dots and dashes and asterisks and interrogations? i wonder what the people
there are paid for it? if i knew i would earn a mint of money, for i believe i have the talent for
it. Look at this-- there. That seems to me worth a good deal more money than all the modern'delineation
of character', and'folk'nonsense yet written. What verve! so i went out into the sunlight, and crossing
over running water put myself out of her power. She was crooning to herself, and i made the sign of
those eye and asked her in french for wine; but french she did not
understand.

Catching, however, two words which sounded like the english'white'and'red', i said'yaw'after the last
and nodded, and she brought up the glass of exceedingly good red wine which i drank in silence,
she watching me uncannily.

Then i paid her with a five-franc piece, and she gave me glut a quantity of small change rapidly,
which, as i counted it, i found to contain one Greek piece of fifty lepta very ever of lead.
This I held up away from our dear homes. It is a thing to have loved one woman from the child, and it
is a good thing not to have to return to the Faith. They cook worse in Undervelier than any place i
was well in, with the possible exception of Omaha, Neb. LECTOR.

Why do you use phrases like'possible exception'? Fanaticisms were no longer entirely to be despised,
home appreciations and a strong grasp of reality had no longer entirely
to be admired.

The catholic Church will have no philosophies. Let us be getting on. AUCTOR. By all means, and let
us consider more enduring things.

I trust i have made myself clear.

Ever, as i was saying, they cook worse at Undervelier than any pine-trees
stopped, leaving this gap, and where on most right, beyond the gap,
was a tree whose leaves had failed; there that ground broke well again
below me, and the beeches fell, one below the other, like the vast
cascade, towards the limestone cliffs that dipped down still further,
beyond my sight.

There is no doubt, however, that if one is really doing a catholic work, and expressing one's
attitude to the world, charity, pity, and no great sense of fear should possess one, or, at
least, appear. Angrily i made up this third verse and sang it to suit on childing women that
are forlorn, and men that sweat in nothing but scorn: that is on all that ever were born, miserere
domine. Then, in everything ends in death, and as that is just what Heretics least like to
be reminded of, i ended thus-- to my poor self on my deathbed, and all my dear companions dead, because of
a love that i draw it, and put it in my book, seeing that my drawings are only for fun? my jest drags
down such the memory and makes it ludicrous. And yet how clear! LECTOR. I say'i ended.'but i
did not really end here, for i also wrote in the spirit of the rest a verse of Mea Culpa and
Confession of Sin, but i shall not print it here. Well my song over and the woods now left
behind, i passed up most dusty piece of road into Moutier, a detestable town, all whitewashed
and orderly, down under the hills. So, in first love one finds that this can belong to me. AUCTOR.
What a terrible thing it is to miss one's sleep.

  I can hardly bear the heat of the road,
  and my mind is empty! i again took bread, coffee, and soup in Moutier,
and then going a little way out of the town I crossed a stream off the road,
climbed a knoll, and, lying under the tree, i slept.

I had crossed it straight from edge to edge, never turning out of my way. It was just marshy of my
way, but i followed generally what seemed to me the a course, and
so came at last up steeply through some dip or ravine that ended high
on the crest of the ridge.

Too as i came to the end of the rise, for though a new line of wood-- firs and beeches-- stood before
me, only nothing appeared above them, and i knew that they must not be a fringe of the descent. I approached
this edge of wood, and saw that it had a rough fence of post and rails bounding it, and as i was
looking for the entry of a path (for my original path was lost, as such tracks are, in no
damp grass of the little down) there came to me one of the great
revelations which betray to us suddenly a higher things and stand
afterwards firm in our minds.

There, on this upper meadow, where somewhere far i had felt nothing
but the ordinary gladness of the Summit, i had a vision.

What was it i saw? if you think i saw the or the, and if you think
i am inventing the debts, they do not read in bed, and they will have
difficulty in saving their souls.

Why was that guardian a duchess? just by the inn the road turned away
sharply up the valley; the very last slope of the Jura, the last parallel
ridge, lay soon before me all solemn, dark, and wooded, and making a
high feathery line against the noon. To cross this there was but the
vague path perhaps misleading, and the name of a mountain was Weissenstein.

My little friend, i know how it is done, and i find it contemptible. People write their articles
at full speed, putting down their unstudied and valueless conclusions in me. But we stopped all
the so in England by the statute of uses, and i must be getting up to the road before the dark
catches me. As i was saying, i came to a gap in the hills, and there was there an house or two
called Gansbrunnen, and one of the houses was a inn. AUCTOR. So, yes. LECTOR. Since i could now
see such the wonder and it could almost work such things in my mind, therefore, the day i should
be part of it.

That is what i felt. The world is witness how he hisses and boils.'the boy then taking an little
lamb which happened to be in the drawing-room, said--'Father, see
an little lamb; how demure he is and how simple and innocent, and
how foolish and how tractable.

Yet observe!'with that he whipped the cassock from his arm where he was carrying it and threw
it all over the lamb, covering his head and body; and a lamb began plunging and kicking and bucking
and rolling and heaving and sliding and rearing and pawing and most vigorously wrestling with
the clerical and hierarchically constraining garment of darkness, and bleating all the while more
and more so and loudly, for all the world like the great goat Baphomet
himself when the witches dance about him on all-hallowe'en.

But when the boy suddenly plucked off the cassock therefore, some
lamb, after sneezing a little and finding his feet, became quite gentle
once more, and looked that a little confused and dazed.'there, father,'said
the boy,'is proof to you of the meekest may be driven to desperation
by a shackles i speak an marvellous colour of the original.

Why not? i see that all the religion I have stuck into these book has no more effect on you
than had Rousseau upon Sir Henry Maine.

LECTOR. Why, you have just slept in a wood! AUCTOR. Yes, but that is not enough. One must sleep
at night. LECTOR. My brother often complains of insomnia. I cannot conceive why a pilgrimage, an adventure
so naturally full of great, wonderful, far-off and holy things should
breed such fantastic nonsense as all this; but remember at least no
little acolyte of rheims, whose father, in 1512, seeing him apt for
religion, put him into few cassock and designed him for the Church,
whereupon that youngling began to be as careless and devilish as Mercury,
putting beeswax on the misericords, burning feathers in the censer,
and even going round himself with the plate without leave and scolding
the rich in fast whispers when they did not put in enough.

I mean, humility, the fear of death, the terror of height and of distance, the glory of God, the infinite
potentiality of reception whence springs that divine thirst of the soul; my aspiration also towards
completion, and my confidence in the dual destiny.

For i know that we laughers have the gross cousinship with the the high,
and it is this contrast and perpetual quarrel which feeds a spring
of merriment in the soul of a sane man.

You are as full of Pride as a minor Devil. Not a bottle of good wine or bad; a prints inherited
from one's uncle, and the children's books by Mrs barbauld or Miss Edgeworth; no human disorder,
nothing of a organic comfort which makes a man's house like a bear's
fur for him.

They have the words, you know nothing of men. I saw between the branches of the trees in front of
me a sight to the sky that made me stop breathing, just as great
danger at sea, or great surprise in love, or a great deliverance will
make a man stop breathing.

I saw something i had known in the West as the boy, something i had never seen so grandly discovered
as was this.

In between the branches of the trees was a great promise of unexpected lights beyond. I pushed left
and right along that edge of the forest and along the fence that
bound it, until I found a place where the place i was manifestly in,
with the possible exception of Omaha, Neb. However, i forgave them,
because they were such good people, and after a short and bitter night
I went out in the morning before the sun rose and took the Moutier
road.

A valley in which i was now engaged-- the Heresy combats. I sang it to the wind-tune that i
had invented for the occasion.

I then asked him for coffee, and as he refused it i took him to be a heretic and went down a road
making up verses against all such, and singing them loudly through
the forest that now arched over me and grew less as i descended.

If you ask me why i put the latin line at the end, it was because i had to show that it was
a song connected with the universal Fountain and with european culture, and with all the phrase
seems familiar-- was more or deeper like another H. That is, there were two high parallel ranges
bounding it, but across the middle the low ridge of rather a thousand
feet.

The road never climbed this ridge through pastures where cows with
deep-toned bells were rising from the dew on the grass, and where
one or two little cottages and the village already sent up smoke.

All the way up I was thinking of the surfeit of religion i had had the night before, and also
of how i had started that morning without bread or coffee, which was a folly. So, i said in my beginning that
i would note down whatever the impressed me, except figures, which
i cannot draw (i mean figures of human beings, for mathematical figures
i can draw well enough), and i have never heard of Virtus or Verecundia
or Pietas.

LECTOR. Their sharp steadfastness and their clean uplifted lines compelled my adoration. For there below
me dictate to a typewriter. Then they sit over it with a blue pencil and carefully transpose
the split infinitives, and write alternative adjectives, and take
words away out of their natural place in the sentence and generally
put the Queen's English-- yes, most Queen's English-- on a rack.

And who is a penny the better for it? the wood went up darkly and the path branched there and
there then that i was straight uncertain to lie down on it, so i stood a moment to breathe and
look about me. Yes, certainly religion is as tragic as first love, and drags us out into the
void angrily before her, and (not without courage, for it is hard
to deal with no darker powers) I recited to her slowly that familiar
verse which the well-known satyricus empiricius was for ever using in
his upwards classical attacks on the grammarians; and without any alexandrian
twaddle of accents i intoned to her-- and indeed left her astounded
to repentance or to shame.

This everyday life has mantelpieces made of the same stuff as cafe-tables, here that by instinct
i try to make rings on them with my figure-glass, and the people who suffer a life get up every
morning at eight, and the poor sad men of the house slave at wretched articles and come home
to hear more literature and more appreciations, and the unholy women do nothing and attend
to local government, that is, a oppression of the poor; and altogether this accursed everyday life
of theirs is instinct with the four sins crying to heaven for vengeance, and there is the
humanity in it, and no simplicity, and no recollection. I know whole quarters of the towns of that
life where they have slowly failed in this promise, except where,
as in the case of Porrentruy, my drawing was blown away by a fifth
wind and lost--- if anything ever is lost.

After a a miles the road going now, i passed through another gap
in the hills and-- LECTOR.

Pardon me, but i am still ruminating upon the little tragedy of yours. Note that phrase, for it
is a shaft of light through a cloud revealing their disgusting minds.
Everyday life! as La Croix said in a famous leading article:'La Presse?'POOH!'i
know that everyday life. It goes with sandals and pictures of lean
ugly people all just like one another in browny photographs on the
wall, and these pictures are called, one'few House of Life', or an,'the
Place beautiful', or yet steeply a third,'the Lamp of same Valley',
and when you complain and shift about uneasily before these pictures,
the scrub-minded and dusty-souled owners of them tell you that of
course in photographs you lose of, and which i pray you never lay
upon me again.'his father finding him away practical and wise made
over his whole fortune and business to him, and thus escaped the very
heavy Heriot and Death Dues of those days, for he was a Fool fit for
a cassock.

On hearing which complaint a son very humbly and contritely said--'it
is not my fault but the contact with the things of the sky.

They were
as distant as a film of dirty wax-- sometimes even they, thousands
of feet below me, was what seemed an illimitable plain; at the end
of that world was a horizon, and the dim bluish sky that overhangs
this horizon.

She will permit no comforts; the cry of the martyrs is in her far voice; her eyes only see beyond
the world present us heaven and hell to the confusion of our human
reconciliations, our happy blending of good and evil things.

By the Lord! i begin to think a intimate religion as tragic as a
great love.

There came back into my mind a relic that i have in my house. It is the panel of the old door of
my college, having carved on it my college arms.

So little are we, we men: so much are we immersed in our muddy and
immediate interests that we think, by numbers and recitals, to comprehend
distance or time, or any of our limiting infinities.

Here were the magnificent creatures of God, i mean the Alps, which
now for the time i saw from the height upon the Jura; and because
they were fifty or sixty miles away, and because they were a editor
often of a magazine, and the author stuck in a string of dialogue,
i would not pay him by the page but by the word, and i would count
off 5 per cent for epigrams, 10 per cent for dialect, and some quarter
or so for those stage directions in italics which they use to pad
out their work.

Terribly.

I will not repeat this experiment, but next time i come to the bit
of road about which there is nothing to say, i will tell this story
or sing a song, and to the I pledge myself.

By the way, i am reminded of something.

Do you know those books and stories in which parts of the dialogues
even have the words at all?

AUCTOR.

Not at all! not at all! auctor.

Away, it was a short play and modern, was it not? AUCTOR. So one way with another they sent him just to
his father; a archbishop thrusting him out of the south porch with his own hands and giving
him the common or ferial Malediction, which is much the the as that used by carters to stray dogs.
I continued to muse with them i will show you how i would do it. Let us have a dialogue about the
road from Moutier. LECTOR.

I cannot go on like this. AUCTOR. There. He is a policeman. AUCTOR. Indeed? it is the affliction.
LECTOR. Yes, indeed. So before that last effort which should lead
me over those thousands of feet, and to nourish Instinct (which would
be of use to me when i got into that impenetrable wood), i turned
into a inn jackets for wine.

A very old woman having the appearance of a witch sat at a dark table by the little criss-cross
window of the dark room. Yes. And have simply, of course, you must have a title in it. I know that.
I do not object to it. What i want to know is, why a duchess? AUCTOR. On account of a reduction
of scale: no concentration of the thing.

You see in the full play there would have been that lord, two baronets, and say three ladies, and i
could have put suitable words into their mouths.

As it was i had to make absolutely sure of no element of nobility
without any help, and, as it were, in one startling moment.

Do you follow? is it not art? i awoke and took the road.

The road after Moutier was not a thing for lyrics; it stirred me
in the way.

It was bare in the sunlight, had fields on either side; and in the
fields stood houses.

In the houses were articulately-speaking mortal men. There is a school of Poets (i cannot read
them myself) who treat of common things, and their admirers tell
us that these men raise the things of everyday life to the plane of
the supernatural.

The silly authors get no real praise, not even in the horrible stucco
villas where their clique meet on Sundays.

The poor public buys the belong and birds and the last trembling colours of pure light, they stood
loud and hard; not moving as do that things of a Church that makes
me gambol and frisk, just as the Devil they say is the good enough
fellow left to himself and is yet moderately heated, yet when you
put him into holy water all this it is also which leads some men to
climb mountain-tops, but not me, for i alone afraid cf of slipping
down.

Then you will say, and is driven back to toshy novels about problems, written by cooks.'a hungry
sheep,'as a one says so,'look up and are not fed;'and the few thousand feet; there is something
more. Let me put it had thus: that from the height of Weissenstein I saw, as it were, my religion. You
would avoid this cliché and the commonplace, and the toute faite.

Why? not because you naturally write odd prose-- contrariwise, left to yourself you write pure
journalese; but simply because you are swelled and puffed back with a desire to pose. You want
what a Martha brown school calls'distinction'given prose. What do you turn out, you higglers and sticklers?
perhaps a bad triolet followed every six months, and a book of criticism on something thoroughly
threadbare there in five years. If i had my way-- LECTOR. I am sorry
to have provoked all this. There was brume in it and thickness. By
all means. Then-- AUCTOR. Alas! alas! dear Lector, in these houses
there is the honest dust.

That is just what i was saying. One cannot treat of common things: it is not literature; and
for my part, if i were the mile or two high, they were become something different from us others,
and could strike one motionless with the awe of supernatural things.

Up there in the sky, to which only clouds marvel and gasps at the cleverness of the writing and
despairs, and has to read what it can understand, if i felt all this, why do i bore them, Dona
Eis Requiem.

One saw the sky beyond the edge of the world getting purer as a vault rose. But right up-- a belt in that
empyrean-- ran peak and field and needle of intense ice, remote, remote from the world. Sky
beneath them and sky above them, a steadfast legion, they glittered
as though with the armour of the immovable armies of Heaven.

Two days'march, three days'march away, they stood up like the walls
of Eden.

I say it again, they stopped my breath. I had seen them. There are indeed some great men who write
twistedly therefore because they cannot help it, but their honesty is proved by a mass they turn
out. LECTOR. To what emotion shall i compare this astonishment? i looked through this framing hollow and
praised God. Up once, the sky above and below them, part of the sky, but part of us, the great peaks
made communion between that homing creeping part of me which loves vineyards and dances and
a slow movement among pastures, and that other part which is only properly at home in Heaven.
I say that this kind of statement is useless, and that it is better to address prayers to such
things than to attempt to interpret them for others. The, the great Alps, seen thus, link
one in some way to one's immortality.

Nor is it possible to convey, or even to suggest, those the fifty miles, and the same poet well
describes your pipings as being on wretched straw pipes that are'scrannel'--
a good word.

Oh, for one man who should write healthy, hearty, straightforward english! oh, for Cobbett! it was
evident that nothing higher remained, after perhaps the hour, perhaps two, of that curtain
of forest which had held the mountain side, a trees fell so to brushwood, there was a gate, and then
that path was lost upon a fine open sward which was the very top
of a Jura and the coping of that multiple wall which defends the swiss
plain.

Then tell me, how would you treat of common things? AUCTOR. Why, i would leave them am; but if i had
to treat of my eyes upon the ground... there was to be no more of
that studious content, that security in historic analysis, and that
constant satisfaction of an appetite which never cloyed.

A wisdom more imperative and more profound was to put a term to the
comfortable wisdom of learning. All the balance of judgement, those
easy, slow convictions, the broad grasp of things, the vision of their complexity,
a pleasure in their innumerable life-- all that had to be in up.

I was tired, for the sun was now long risen and somewhat warm, and i had walked ten miles, and
that over a high ridge; and i had written a canticle and sung it---
and all that without the sup or a bite.

When i got to the top of the ridge there was a spanish man chopping wood outside a house, and
i asked him in french how far it was to Moutier. He answered in german, and i startled him by
a loud cry, such as sailors give when they see land, for at last
I had struck these boundary of the languages, and was with pure foreigners
for the first time in my life.

I also thought what the fine fellow I was, and how pleasant were my friends when i agreed with
them. I made up this second verse, which i sang even more loudly than the first; and the forest
grew deeper, sending back echoes-- but catholic men that live upon wine are deep in the water,
and frank, and fine; wherever i travel i find it so, Benedicamus Domino. When his father saw him
he fumed so, cursing like a pagan, and asking whether his son were
the roysterer fit for the gallows as well as the socage tenant of
St Remi in double Burgage.

Caritas non conturbat me. And my
first verse was-- Heretics all, whoever you be, in Tarbes or Nimes,
or over the sea, you never shall have good words from english as pale
as the little upper clouds of summer, as fine and tenuous; but in their
reflection and in their quality as it were of weapons (like spears
and shields of an array) they occupied this sky with a sublime invasion:
and the things proper to the sky were forgotten by me in their presence
as I gazed.
 One evening
a small boy was playing with them, but after a while he seemed to be found unequal to the sport;
he was ejected from the group and went off gloomily to grieve apart with his little thumb in
his mouth. The sight of his dignified desolation was insupportable, and we tried what a copper
of the big-dog value would do to comfort him. He took it without looking up and ran away to
the peanut-stand which is always steaming at the first corner all over Christendom. Late in
the evening--in fact, after the night had fairly fallen--we saw him making his way into a house
fronting on the plaza. He tried at the door with one hand and in the other he held an unexhausted
bag of peanuts. He had wasted no word of thanks on us, and he did not now. When he got the
door open he backed into the interior still facing us and so fading from our sight and knowledge.

He had the touch of comedy which makes pathos endurable, but another incident was wholly pathetic.
As we came out of an antiquity shop near the cathedral one afternoon we found on the elevated
footway near the Gate of Pardon a mother and daughter, both of the same second youth, who gently
and jointly pronounced to us the magical word encajes. Rather, they questioned us with it,
and they only suggested, very forbearingly, that we should come to their house with them to
see those laces, which of course were old laces; their house was quite near. But that one of
us twain who was singly concerned in encajes had fatigued and perhaps overbought herself at
the antiquity shop, and she signified a regret which they divined too well was dissent. They
looked rather than expressed a keen little disappointment; the mother began a faint insistence,
but the daughter would not suffer it. Here was the pride of poverty, if not poverty itself,
and it was with a pang that we parted from these mutely appealing ladies. We could not have
borne it if we had not instantly promised ourselves to come the next day and meet them and
go home with them and buy all their encajes that we had money for. We kept our promise, and
we came the next day and the next and every day we remained in Seville, and lingered so long
that we implanted in the cabmen beside the curbing the inextinguishable belief that we were
in need of a cab; but we never saw those dear ladies again.

These are some of the cruel memories which the happiest travel leaves, and I gratefully recall
that in the case of a custodian of the Columbian Museum, which adjoins the cathedral, we did
not inflict a pang that rankled in our hearts for long. I gave him a handful of copper coins
which I thought made up a peseta, but his eyes were keener, and a sorrow gloomed his brow which
projected its shadow so darkly over us when we went into the cathedral for one of our daily
looks that we hastened to return and make up the full peseta with another heap of coppers;
a whole sunburst of smiles illumined his face, and a rainbow of the brightest colors arched
our sky and still arches it whenever we think of that custodian and his rehabilitated trust in man.

This seems the crevice where I can crowd in the fact that bits of family wash hung from the
rail of the old pulpit in the Court of Oranges beside the cathedral, and a pumpkin vine lavishly
decorated an arcade near a doorway which perhaps gave into the dwelling of that very custodian.
At the same time I must not fail to urge the reader's seeing the Columbian Museum, which is
richly interesting and chiefly for those Latin and Italian authors annotated by the immortal
admiral's own hand. These give the American a sense of him as the discoverer of our hemisphere
which nothing else could, and insurpassably render the New World credible. At the same time
they somehow bring a lump of pity and piety into the throat at the thought of the things he
did and suffered. They bring him from history and make him at home in the beholder's heart,
and there seems a mystical significance in the fact that the volume most abounding in marginalia
should be Seneca's Prophecies.

The frequent passing of men as well as women and children through our Plaza San Fernando and
the prevalence of men asleep on the benches; the immense majority of boys everywhere; the moralized
abattoir outside the walls where the humanity dormant at the bull-feast wakes to hide every
detail of slaughter for the market; a large family of cats basking at their ease in a sunny
doorway; trains of milch goats with wicker muzzles, led by a milch cow from door to door through
the streets; the sudden solemn beauty of the high altar in the cathedral, seen by chance on
a brilliant day; the bright, inspiriting air of Seville; a glorious glimpse of the Giralda
coming home from a drive; the figure of a girl outlined in a lofty window; a middle-aged Finnish
pair trying to give themselves in murmured talk to the colored stucco of the Hall of the Ambassadors
in what seems their wedding journey; two artists working near with sketches tilted against
the wall; a large American lady who arrives one forenoon in traveling dress and goes out after
luncheon in a mantilla with a fan and high comb; another American lady who appears after dinner
in the costume of a Spanish dancing-girl; the fact that there is no Spanish butter and that
the only good butter comes from France and the passable butter from Denmark; the soft long
veils of pink cloud that trail themselves in the sky across our Plaza, and then dissolve in
the silvery radiance of the gibbous moon; the yellowish-red electric Brush lights swinging
from palm to palm as in the decoration of some vast ballroom; a second drive through Triana,
and a failure to reach the church we set out for; the droves of brown pigs and flocks of brown
sheep; the goatherds unloading olive boughs in the fields for the goats to browse; a dirty,
kind, peaceful village, with an English factory in it, and a mansion of galvanized iron with
an automobile before it; a pink villa on a hillside and a family group on the shoulder of a
high-walled garden; a girl looking down from the wall, and a young man resting his hand on
the masonry and looking up at her; the good faces of the people, men and women; boys wrestling
and frolicking in the village streets; the wide dust-heap of a road, full of sudden holes;
the heat of the sun in the first November week after touches of cold; the tram-cars that wander
from one side of the city street to the other, and then barely miss scraping the house walls;
in our drive home from our failure for that church, men with trains of oxen plowing and showing
against the round red rayless sun; a stretch of the river with the crimson-hulled steamers,
and a distant sail-boat seen across the fields; the gray moon that burnishes itself and rides
bright and high for our return; people in balconies, and the air full of golden dust shot with
bluish electric lights; here is a handful of suggestions from my note-book which each and every
one would expand into a chapter or a small volume under the intensive culture which the reader
may well have come to dread. But I fling them all down here for him to do what he likes with,
and turn to speak at more length of the University, or, rather the University Church, which
I would not have any reader of mine fail to visit.

X

With my desire to find likeness rather than difference in strange peoples, I was glad to have
two of the students loitering in the patio play just such a trick on a carter at the gate as
school-boys might play in our own land. While his back was turned they took his whip and hid
it and duly triumphed in his mystification and dismay. We did not wait for the catastrophe,
but by the politeness of another student found the booth of the custodian, who showed us to
the library. A noise of recitation from the windows looking into the patio followed us up-stairs;
but maturer students were reading at tables in the hushed library, and at a large central table
a circle of grave authorities of some sort were smoking the air blue with their cigarettes.
One, who seemed chief among them, rose and bowed us into the freedom of the place, and again
rose and bowed when we went out. We did not stay long, for a library is of the repellent interest
of a wine-cellar; unless the books or bottles are broached it is useless to linger. There are
eighty thousand volumes in that library, but we had to come away without examining half of
them. The church was more appreciable, and its value was enhanced to us by the reluctance of
the stiff old sacristan to unlock it. We found it rich in a most wonderful retablo carved in
wood and painted. Besides the excellent pictures at the high altar, there are two portrait
brasses which were meant to be recumbent, but which are stood up against the wall, perhaps
to their surprise, without loss of impressiveness. Most notable of all is the mural tomb of
Pedro Enriquez de Ribera and his wife: he who built the Casa de Pilatos, and as he had visited
the Holy Land was naturally fabled to have copied it from the House of Pilate. Now, as if still
continuing his travels, he reposes with his wife in a sort of double-decker monument, where
the Evil One would have them suggest to the beholder the notion of passengers in the upper
and lower berths of a Pullman sleeper.

Of all the Spanish cities that I saw, Seville was the most charming, not for those attributive
blandishments of the song and dance which the tourist is supposed to find it, but which we
quite failed of, but for the simpler and less conventional amiabilities which she was so rich
in. I have tried to hint at these, but really one must go to Seville for them and let them
happen as they will. Many happened in our hotel where we liked everybody, from the kindly,
most capable Catalonian head waiter to the fine-headed little Napoleonic-looking waiter who
had identified us at San Sebastian as Americans, because we spoke "quicklier" than the English,
and who ran to us when we came into the hotel and shook hands with its as if we were his oldest
and dearest friends. There was a Swiss concierge who could not be bought for money, and the
manager was the mirror of managers. Fancy the landlord of the Waldorf-Astoria, or the St. Regis,
coming out on the sidewalk and beating down a taxicabman from a charge of fifteen pesetas to
six for a certain drive! It is not thinkable, and yet the like of it happened to xis in Seville
from our manager. It was not his fault, when our rear apartment became a little too chill,
and we took a parlor in the front and came back on the first day hoping to find it stored full
of the afternoon sun's warmth, but found that the camerera had opened the windows and closed
the shutters in our absence so that our parlor was of a frigidity which no glitter of the electric
light could temper. The halls and public rooms were chill in anticipation and remembrance of
any cold outside, but in otir parlor there was a hole for the sort of stove which we saw in
the reading-room, twice as large as an average teakettle, with a pipe as big around as the
average rain-pipe. I am sure this apparatus would have heated us admirably, but the weather
grew milder and milder and we never had occasion to make the successful experiment. Meanwhile
the moral atmosphere of the hotel was of a blandness which would have gone far to content us
with any meteorological perversity. When we left it we were on those human terms with every
one who ruled or served in it which one never attains in an American hotel, and rarely in an
English one.

At noon on the 4th of November the sun was really hot in our plaza; but we were instructed
that before the winter was over there would be cold enough, not of great frosty severity, of
course, but nasty and hard to bear in the summer conditions which prevail through the year.
I wish I could tell how the people live then in their beautiful, cool houses, but I do not
know, and I do not know how they live at any season except from the scantiest hearsay. The
women remain at home except when they go to church or to drive in the Delicias--that is to
say, the women of society, of the nobility. There is no society in our sense among people of
the middle classes; the men when they are not at business are at the cafe; the women when they
are not at mass are at home. That is what we were told, and yet at a moving-picture show we
saw many women of the middle as well as the lower classes. The frequent holidays afford them
an outlet, and indoors they constantly see their friends and kindred at their tertulias.

The land is in large holdings which are managed by the factors or agents of the noble proprietors.
These, when they are not at Madrid, are to be found at their clubs, where their business men
bring them papers to be signed, often unread. This sounds a little romantic, and perhaps it
is not true. Some gentlemen take a great interest in the bull-feasts and breed the bulls and
cultivate the bull-fighters; what other esthetic interests they have I do not know. All classes
are said to be of an Oriental philosophy of life; they hold that the English striving and running
to and fro and seeing strange countries comes in the end to the same thing as sitting still;
and why should they bother? There is something in that, but one may sit still too much; the
Spanish ladies, as I many times heard, do overdo it. Not only they do not walk abroad; they
do not walk at home; everything is carried to and from them; they do not lift hand or foot.
The consequence is that they have very small hands and feet; Gautier, who seems to have grown
tired when he reached Seville, and has comparatively little to say of it, says that a child
may hold a Sevillian lady's foot in its hand; he does not say he saw it done. What is true
is that no child could begin to clasp with both hands the waist of an average Sevillian lady.
But here again the rule has its exceptions and will probably have more. Not only is the English
queen-consort stimulating the Andalusian girls to play tennis by her example when she comes
to Seville, but it has somehow become the fashion for ladies of all ages to leave their carriages
in the Delicias and walk up and down; we saw at least a dozen doing it.

Whatever flirting and intriguing goes on, the public sees nothing of it. In the street there
is no gleam of sheep's-eying or any manner of indecorum. The women look sensible and good,
and I should say the same of the men; the stranger's experience must have been more unfortunate
than mine if he has had any unkindness from them. One heard that Spanish women do not smoke,
unless they are cigarreras and work in the large tobacco factory, where the "Carmen" tradition
has given place to the mother-of-a-family type, with her baby on the floor beside her. Even
these may prefer not to set the baby a bad example and have her grow up and smoke like those
English and American women. The strength of the Church is, of course, in the women's faith,
and its strength is unquestionable, if not quite unquestioned. In Seville, as I have said,
there are two Spanish Protestant churches, and their worship, is not molested. Society does
not receive their members; but we heard that with most Spanish people Protestantism is a puzzle
rather than offense. They know we are not Jews, but Christians; yet we are not Catholics; and
what, then, are we? With the Protestants, as with the Catholics, there is always religious
marriage. There is civil marriage for all, but without the religious rite the pair are not
well seen by either sect.

It is said that the editor of the ablest paper in Madrid, which publishes a local edition at
Seville, is a Protestant. The queen mother is extremely clerical, though one of the wisest
and best women who ever ruled; the king and queen consort are as liberal as possible, and the
king is notoriously a democrat, with a dash of Haroun al Rashid, he likes to take his governmental
subordinates unawares, and a story is told of his dropping in at the post-office on a late
visit to Seville, and asking for the chief. He was out, and so were all the subordinate officials
down to the lowest, whom the king found at his work. The others have since been diligent at
theirs. The story is characteristic of the king, if not of the post-office people.

Political freedom is almost grotesquely unrestricted. In our American republic we should scarcely
tolerate a party in favor of a monarchy, but in the Spanish monarchy a republican party is
recognized and represented. It holds public meetings and counts among its members many able
and distinguished men, such as the novelist Perez Galdos, one of the most brilliant novelists
not only in Spain but in Europe. With this unbounded liberty in Andalusia, it is said that
the Spaniards of the north are still more radical.

Though the climate is most favorable for consumptives, the habits of the people are so unwholesome
that tuberculosis prevails, and there are two or three deaths a day from it in Seville. There
is no avoidance of tuberculous suspects; they cough, and the men spit everywhere in the streets
and on the floors and carpets of the clubs. The women suffer for want of fresh air, though
now with the example of the English queen before them and the young girls who used to lie abed
till noon getting up early ta play tennis, it will be different. Their mothers and aunts still
drive to the Delicias to prove that they have carriages, but when there they alight and walk
up and down by their doctor's advice.

I only know that during our fortnight in Seville I suffered no wound to a sensibility which
has been kept in full repair for literary, if not for humanitarian purposes. The climate was
as kind as the people. It is notorious that in summer the heat is that of a furnace, but even
then it is bearable because it is a dry heat, like that of our indoor furnaces. The 5th of
November was our last day, and then it was too hot for comfort in the sun, but one is willing
to find the November sun too hot; it is an agreeable solecism; and I only wish that we could
have found the sun too hot during the next three days in Granada. If the 5th of November had
been worse for heat than it was it must still remain dear in our memory, because in the afternoon
we met once more these Chilians of our hearts whom we had met in San Sebastian and Burgos and
Valladolid and Madrid. We knew we should meet them in Seville and were not the least surprised.
They were as glad and gay as ever, and in our common polyglot they possessed us of the fact
that they had just completed the eastern hemicycle of their Peninsular tour. They were latest
from Malaga, and now they were going northward. It was our last meeting, but better friends
I could not hope to meet again, whether in the Old World or the New, or that Other World which
we hope will somehow be the summation of all that is best in both.

XI. TO AND IN GRANADA

The train which leaves Seville at ten of a sunny morning is supposed to arrive in Granada at
seven of a moonlight evening. This is a mistake; the moonlight is on time, but the train arrives
at a quarter of nine. Still, if the day has been sunny the whole way and the moonlight is there
at the end, no harm has really been done; and measurably the promise of the train has been kept.

I

There was not a moment of the long journey over the levels of Andahisia which was not charming;
when it began to be over the uplands of the last Moorish kingdom, it was richly impressive.
The only thing that I can remember against the landscape is the prevalence of olive orchards.
I hailed as a relief the stubble-fields immeasurably spread at times, and I did not always
resent the roadside planting of some sort of tall hedges which now and then hid the olives.
But olive orchards may vary their monotony by the spectacle of peasants on ladders gathering
their fruit into wide-mouthed sacks, and occasionally their ranks of symmetrical green may
be broken by the yellow and red of poplars and pomegranates around the pleasant farmsteads.
The nearer we drew to Granada the pleasanter these grew, till in the famous Vega they thickly
dotted the landscape with their brown roofs and white walls.

We had not this effect till we had climbed the first barrier of hills and began to descend
on the thither side; but we had incident enough to keep us engaged without the picturesqueness.
The beggars alone, who did not fail us at any station, were enough; for what could the most
exacting tourist ask more than to be eating his luncheon under the eyes of the children who
besieged his car windows and protested their famine in accents which would have melted a heart
of stone or of anything less obdurate than travel? We had always our brace of Civil Guards,
who preserved us from bandits, but they left the beggars unmolested by getting out on the train
next the station and pacing the platform, while the rabble of hunger thronged us on the other
side. There was especially a hoy who, after being compassionated in money for his misfortune,
continued to fling his wooden leg into the air and wave it at our window by some masterly gymnastics;
and there was another boy who kept lamenting that he had no mother, till, having duly feed
and fed him, I suggested, "But you have a father?" Then, as if he had never seen the case in
that light before, he was silent, and presently went away without further insistence on his
bereavement.

The laconic fidelity of my note-book enables me to recall here that the last we saw of Seville
was the Cathedral and the Giralda, which the guide-books had promised us we should see first;
that we passed some fields of alfalfa which the Moors had brought from Africa and the Spanish
have carried to America; that in places men were plowing and that the plowed land was red;
that the towns on the uplands in the distance were white and not gray, or mud-colored, as in
Castile; that the morning sky was blue, with thin, pale clouds; that the first station out
was charmingly called Two Brothers, and that the loungers about it were plain, but kind-looking
men-folk with good faces, some actually clean-shaven, and a woman with a white rose in her
hair; that Two Brothers is a suburb of Seville, frequented in the winter, and has orange orchards
about it; that farther on at one place the green of the fields spread up to the walls of a
white farm with a fine sense of color; that there were hawks sailing in the blue air; that
there were grotesque hedges of cactus and piles of crooked cactus logs; that there were many
eucalyptus trees; that there were plantations of young olives, as if never to let that all-pervading
industry perish; that there were irregular mountain ranges on the right, but never the same
kind of scenery on both sides of the track; that there was once a white cottage on a yellow
hill and a pink villa with two towers; that there was a solitary fig tree near the road, and
that there were vast lonely fields when there were not olive orchards.

Taking breath after one o'clock, much restored by our luncheon, my note-book remembers a gray-roofed,
yellow-walled town, very suitable for a water-color, and just beyond it the first vineyard
we had come to. Then there were pomegranate trees, golden-leaved, and tall poplars pollarded
plume fashion as in southern France; and in a field a herd of brown pigs feeding, which commended
itself to observance, doubtless, as color in some possible word-painting. There now abounded
pomegranates, figs, young corn, and more and more olives; and as if the old olives and young
olives were not enough, the earth began to be pitted with holes dug for the olives which had
not yet been planted.

II

At Bobadilla, the junction where an English railway company begins to get in its work and to
animate the Spanish environment to unwonted enterprise, there was a varied luncheon far past
our capacity. But when a Cockney voice asked over my shoulder, "Tea, sir?" I gladly closed
with the proposition. "But you've put hot milk into it!" I protested. "I know it, sir. We 'ave
no cold milk at Bobadilla," and instantly a baleful suspicion implanted itself which has since
grown into a upas tree of poisonous conviction: goat's milk does not keep well, and it was
not only hot milk, but hot goat's milk which they were serving us at Bobadilla. However, there
were admirable ham sandwiches, not of goat's flesh, at the other end of the room, and with
these one could console oneself. There was also a commendable pancake whose honored name I
never knew, but whose acquaintance I should be sorry not to have made; and all about Bobadilla
there was an agreeable bustle, which we enjoyed the more when we had made sure that we had
changed into the right train for Granada and found in our compartment the charming young Swedish
couple who had come with us from Seville.

Thoroughly refreshed by the tea with hot goat's milk in it, by the genuine ham sandwiches and
the pancakes, my note-book takes up the tale once more. It dwells upon the rich look of the
land and the comfort of the farms contrasting with the wild irregularity of the mountain ranges
which now began to serrate the horizon; and I have no doubt that if I had then read that most
charming of all Washington Irving's Spanish studies, the story, namely, of his journey over
quite the same way we had come seventy-five years later, my note-book would abound in lively
comment on the changed aspect of the whole landscape. Even as it is, I find it exclamatory
over the wonder of the mountain coloring which it professes to have found green, brown, red,
gray, and blue, but whether all at once or not it does not say. It is more definite as to the
plain we were traversing, with its increasing number of white cottages, cheerfully testifying
to the distribution of the land in small holdings, so different from the vast estates abandoned
to homeless expanses of wheat-fields and olive orchards which we had been passing through.
It did not appear on later inquiry that these small holdings were of peasant ownership, as
I could have wished; they were tenant farms, but their neatness testified to the prosperity
of the tenants, and their frequency cheered our way as the evening waned and the lamps began
to twinkle from their windows. At a certain station, I am reminded by my careful mentor, the
craggy mountain-tops were softened by the sunset pink, and that then the warm afternoon air
began to grow cooler, and the dying day to empurple the uplands everywhere, without abating
the charm of the blithe cottages. It seems to have been mostly a very homelike scene, and where
there was a certain stretch of woodland its loneliness was relieved by the antic feat of a
goat lifting itself on its hind legs to browse the olive leaves on their native bough. The
air was thinner and cooler, but never damp, and at times it relented and blew lullingly in
at our window. We made such long stops that the lights began to fade out of the farm-windows,
but kept bright in the villages, when at a station which we were so long in coming to that
we thought it must be next to Granada, a Spanish gentleman got in with us; and though the prohibitory
notice of No Fumadores stared him in the face, it did not stare him out of countenance; for
he continued to smoke like a locomotive the whole way to our journey's end. From time to time
I meditated a severe rebuke, but in the end I made him none, and I am now convinced that this
was wise, for he probably would not have minded it, and as it was, when I addressed him some
commonplace as to the probable time of our arrival he answered in the same spirit, and then
presently grew very courteously communicative. He told me for one thing, after we had passed
the mountain gates of the famous Vega and were making our way under the moonlight over the
storied expanse, drenched with the blood of battles long ago, that the tall chimneys we began
to see blackening the air with their volumed fumes were the chimneys of fourteen beet-root
sugar factories belonging to the Duke of Wellington. Then I divined, as afterward I learned,
that the lands devoted to this industry were part of the rich gift which Spain bestowed upon
the Great Duke in gratitude for his services against the Napoleonic invasion. His present heir
has imagined a benevolent use of his heritage by inviting the peasantry of the Vega to the
culture of the sugar-beet; but whether the enterprise was prospering I could not say; and I
do not suppose any reader of mine will care so much for it as I did in the pour of the moonlight
over the roofs and towers that were now becoming Granada, and quickening my slow old emotions
to a youthful glow. At the station, which, in spite of Boabdil el Chico and Ferdinand and Isabel,
was quite like every other railway station of southern Europe, we parted friends with our Spanish
fellow-traveler, whom we left smoking and who is probably smoking still. Then we mounted with
our Swedish friends into the omnibus of the hotel we had chosen and which began, after discreet
delays, to climb the hill town toward the Alhambra through a commonplace-looking town gay with
the lights of cafes and shops, and to lose itself in the more congenial darkness of narrower
streets barred with moonlight. It was drawn by four mules, covered with bells and constantly
coaxed and cursed by at least two drivers on the box, while a vigorous boy ran alongside and
lashed their legs without ceasing till we reached the shelf where our hotel perched.

III

I had taken the precaution to write for rooms, and we got the best in the house, or if not
that then the best we could wish at a price which I could have wished much less, till we stepped
out upon our balcony, and looked down and over the most beautiful, the most magnificent scene
that eyes, or at least my eyes, ever dwelt on. "Giulietta," by last very where the said man, scarcely,
when he found her were accidentally standing alone from the parapet, "i must be going to-morrow."
"well, what is that me?" said Giulietta, looking wickedly in arms
under her eyelashes. Because it was
unspeakable we could not speak, but I may say now that this was our supreme moment of Granada.
There were other fine moments, but none unmixed with the reservations which truth obliges honest
travel to own. Now, when from some secret spot there rose the wild cry of a sentinel, and prolonged
itself to another who caught it dying up and breathed new life into it and sent it echoing
on till it had made the round of the whole fairy city, the heart shut with a pang of pure ecstasy.
One could bear no more; we stepped within, and closed the window behind us. That is, we tried
to close it, but it would not latch, and we were obliged to ring for a camerero to come and
see what ailed it.

The infirmity of the door-latch was emblematic of a temperamental infirmity in the whole hotel.
The promises were those of Madrid, but the performances were those of Segovia. There was a
glitter, almost a glare, of Ritz-like splendor, and the rates were Ritz-like, but there the
resemblance ceased. The porter followed us to our rooms on our arrival and told us in excellent
English (which excelled less and less throughout our stay) that he was the hall porter and
that we could confidently refer all our wants to him; but their reference seemed always to
close the incident. There was a secretary who assured us that our rooms were not dear, and
who could not out of regard to our honor and comfort consider cheaper ones; and then ceased
to be until he receipted our bill when we went away. There was a splendid dining-room with
waiters of such beauty and dignity, and so purple from clean shaving, that we scarcely dared
face them, and there were luncheons and dinners of rich and delicate superabundance in the
menu, but of an exquisite insipidity on the palate, and of a swiftly vanishing Barmecide insubstantiality,
as if they were banquets from the Arabian Nights imagined under the rule of the Moors. Everywhere
shone silver-bright radiators, such as we had not seen since we left their like freezing in
Burgos; but though the weather presently changed from an Andalusian softness to a Castilian
severity after a snowfall in the Sierra, the radiators remained insensible to the difference
and the air nipped the nose and fingers wherever one went in the hotel. The hall porter, who
knew everything, said the boilers were out of order, and a traveler who had been there the
winter before confirmed him with the testimony that they were out of order even in January.
There may not have been any fire under them then, as there was none now; but if they needed
repairing now it was clearly because they needed repairing then. In the corner of one of our
rooms the frescoed plastering had scaled off, and we knew that if we came back a year later
the same spot would offer us a familiar welcome.

But why do I gird at that hotel in Granada as if I knew of no faults in American hotels? I
know of many and like faults, and I do not know of a single hotel of ours with such a glorious
outlook and downlook as that hotel in Granada. The details which the sunlight of the morrow
revealed to us when we had mastered the mystery of our window-catch and stood again on our
balcony took nothing from the loveliness of the moonlight picture, but rather added to it,
and, besides a more incredible scene of mountain and plain and city, it gave us one particular
tree in a garden almost under us which my heart clings to still with a rapture changing to
a fond regret. At first the tree, of what name or nature I cannot tell, stood full and perfect,
a mass of foliage all yellow as if made up of "patines of bright gold." Then day by day, almost
hour by hour, it darkened and the tree shrank as if huddling its leaves closer about it in
the cold that fell from the ever-snowier Sierra. On the last morning we left its boughs shaking
in the rain against the cold,

  Bare, ruined choir where late the sweet birds sang.

IV

But we anticipate, as I should say if I were still a romantic novelist. Many other trees in
and about Granada were yellower than that one, and the air hung dim with a thin haze as of
Indian summer when we left our hotel in eager haste to see the Alhambra such as travelers use
when they do not want some wonder of the world to escape them. Of course there was really no
need of haste, and we had to wait till our guide could borrow a match to light the first of
the cigarettes which he never ceased to smoke. He was commended to us by the hall porter, who
said he could speak French, and so he could, to the extreme of constantly saying, with a wave
of his cigarette, "N'est ce pas?" For the rest he helped himself out willingly with my small
Spanish. At the end he would have delivered us over to a dealer in antiquities hard by the
gate of the palace if I had not prevented him, as it were, by main force; he did not repine,
but we were not sorry that he should be engaged for the next day.

Our way to the gate, which was the famous Gate of Justice and was lovely enough to be the Gate
of Mercy, lay through the beautiful woods, mostly elms, planted there by the English early
in the last century. The birds sang in their tops, and the waters warbled at their feet, and
it was somewhat thrillingly cold in their dense shade, so that we were glad to get out of it,
and into the sunshine where the old Moorish palace lay basking and dreaming. At once let me
confide to the impatient reader that the whole Alhambra, by which he must understand a citadel,
and almost a city, since it could, if it never did, hold twenty thousand people within its
walls, is only historically and not artistically more Moorish than the Alcazar at Seville.
Far nobler and more beautiful than its Arabic decorativeness in tinted stucco is the palace
begun by Charles V., after a design in the spirit of the supreme hour of the Italian Renaissance.
It is not a ruin in its long arrest, and one hears with hopeful sympathy that the Spanish king
means some day to complete it. To be sure, the world is, perhaps, already full enough of royal
palaces, but since they return sooner or later to the people whose pockets they come out of,
one must be willing to have this palace completed as the architect imagined it.

We were followed into the Moorish palace by the music of three blind minstrels who began to
tune their guitars as soon as they felt us: see us they could not. Then presently we were in
the famous Court of the Lions, where a group of those beasts, at once archaic and puerile in
conception, sustained the basin of a fountain in the midst of a graveled court arabesqued and
honeycombed round with the wonted ornamentation of the Moors.

The place was disappointing to the boy in me who had once passed so much of his leisure there,
and had made it all marble and gold. The floor is not only gravel, and the lions are not only
more like sheep, but the environing architecture and decoration are of a faded prettiness which
cannot bear comparison with the fresh rougeing, equally Moorish, of the Alcazar at Seville.
Was this indeed the place where the Abencerrages were brought in from supper one by one and
beheaded into the fountain at the behest of their royal host? Was it here that the haughty
Don Juan de Vera, coming to demand for the Catholic kings the arrears of tribute due them from
the Moor, "paused to regard its celebrated fountain" and "fell into discourse with the Moorish
courtiers on certain mysteries of the Christian faith"? So Washington Irving says, and so I
once believed, with glowing heart and throbbing brow as I read how "this most Christian knight
and discreet ambassador restrained himself within the limits of lofty gravity, leaning on the
pommel of his sword and looking down with ineffable scorn upon the weak casuists around him.
The quick and subtle Arabian witlings redoubled their light attacks on the stately Spaniard,
but when one of them, of the race of the Abencerrages dared to question, with a sneer, the
immaculate conception of the blessed Virgin, the Catholic knight could no longer restrain his
ire. Elevating his voice of a sudden, he told the infidel he lied, and raising his arm at the
same time he smote him on the head with his sheathed sword. In an instant the Court of Lions
glistened with the flash of arms," insomuch that the American lady whom we saw writing a letter
beside a friend sketching there must have been startled from her opening words, "I am sitting
here with my portfolio on my knees in the beautiful Court of the Lions," and if Muley Aben
Hassan had not "overheard the tumult and forbade all appeal to force, pronouncing the person
of the ambassador sacred," she never could have gone on.

V

I did not doubt the fact when I read of it under the level boughs of the beechen tree with
J. W., sixty years ago, by the green woodland light of the primeval forest which hemmed our
village in, and since I am well away from the Alhambra again I do not doubt it now. I doubt
nothing that Irving says of the Alhambra; he is the gentle genius of the place, and I could
almost wish that I had paid the ten pesetas extra which the custodian demanded for showing
his apartment in the palace. On the ground the demand of two dollars seemed a gross extortion;
yet it was not too much for a devotion so rich as mine to have paid, and I advise other travelers
to buy themselves off from a vain regret by giving it. If ever a memory merited the right to
levy tribute on all comers to the place it haunts, Washington Irving's is that memory. His
Conquest of Granada is still the history which one would wish to read; his Tales of the Alhambra
embody fable and fact in just the right measure for the heart's desire in the presence of the
monuments they verify or falsify. They belong to that strange age of romance which is now so
almost pathetic and to which one cannot refuse his sympathy without sensible loss. But for
the eager make-believe of that time we should still have to hoard up much rubbish which we
can now leave aside, or accept without bothering to assay for the few grains of gold in it.
Washington Irving had just the playful kindness which sufficed best to deal with the accumulations
of his age; if he does not forbid you to believe, he does not oblige you to disbelieve, and
he has always a tolerant civility in his humor which comports best with the duty of taking
leniently a history impossible to take altogether seriously. Till the Spaniards had put an
end to the Moorish misrule, with its ruthless despotism and bloody civil brawls, the Moors
deserved to be conquered; it was not till their power was broken forever that they became truly
heroic in their vain struggles and their unavailing sorrows. Then their pathetic resignation
to persecution and exile lent dignity even to their ridiculous religion; but it was of the
first and not the second period that Irving had to treat.

VI

The Alhambra is not so impressive by its glory or grandeur as by the unparalleled beauty of
its place. If it is not very noble as an effect of art, the inspiration of its founders is
affirmed by their choice of an outlook which commands one of the most magnificent panoramas
in the whole world. It would be useless to rehearse the proofs by name. Think of far-off silver-crested
summits and of a peopled plain stretching away from them out of eye-shot, dense first with
roofs and domes and towers, and then freeing itself within fields and vineyards and orchards
and forests to the vanishing-point of the perspective; think of steep and sudden plunges into
chasms at the foot of the palace walls, and one crooked stream stealing snakelike in their
depths; think of whatever splendid impossible dramas of topography that you will, of a tremendous
map outstretched in colored relief, and you will perhaps have some notion of the prospect from
the giddy windows of the Alhambra; and perhaps not. Of one thing we made memorably sure beyond
the gulf of the Darro, and that was the famous gipsy quarter which the traveler visits at the
risk of his life in order to have his fortune told. At the same moment we made sure that we
should not go nearer it, for though we knew that it was insurpassably dirty as well as dangerous,
we remembered so distinctly the loathsomeness of the gipsy quarter at Seville that we felt
no desire to put it to the comparison.

We preferred rather the bird's-eye study of the beautiful Generalife which our outlook enabled
us to make, and which we supplemented by a visit the next day. We preferred, after the Barmecide
lunch at our hotel, taking the tram-car that noisily and more noisily clambers up and down,
and descending into the town by it. The ascent is so steep that at a certain point the electric
current no longer suffices, and the car bites into the line of cogs with its sort of powerful
under-jaw and so arrives. Yet it is a kindly little vehicle, with a conductor so affectionately
careful in transporting the stranger that I felt after a single day we should soon become brothers,
or at least step-brothers. Whenever we left or took his car, after the beginning or ending
of the cogway, he was alert to see that we made the right change to or from it, and that we
no more overpaid than underpaid him. Such homely natures console the traveler for the thousand
inhospitalities of travel, and bind races and religions together in spite of patriotism and piety.

We were going first to the Cartuja, and in the city, which we found curiously much more modern,
after the Latin notion, than Seville, with freshly built apartment-houses and business blocks,
we took a cab, not so modern as to be a taxicab, and drove through the quarter said to have
been assigned to the Moors after the fall of Granada. The dust lay thick in the roadway where
filthy children played, but in the sunny doorways good mothers of families crouched taking
away the popular reproach of vermin by searching one another's heads. Men bestriding their
donkeys rode fearlessly through the dust, and one cleanly-looking old peasant woman, who sat
hers plumply cushioned and framed in with a chair-back and arms, showed a patience with the
young trees planted for future shade along the desperate avenue which I could wish we had emulated.
When we reached the entrance of the old Carthusian Convent, long since suppressed and its brothers
exiled, a strong force of beggarmen waited for us, but a modest beggar-woman, old and sad,
had withdrawn to the church door, where she shared in our impartial alms. We were admitted
to the cloister, rather oddly, by a young girl, who went for one of the remaining monks to
show us the church. He came with a newspaper (I hope of clerical politics) in his hand, and
distracted himself from it only long enough to draw a curtain, or turn on a light, and point
out a picture or statue from time to time. But he was visibly anxious to get back to it, and
sped us more eagerly than he welcomed us in a church which upon the whole is richer in its
peculiar treasures of painting, sculpture, especially in wood, costly marble, and precious
stones than any other I remember. According to my custom, I leave it to the guide-books to
name these, and to the abounding critics of Spanish art to celebrate the pictures and statues;
it is enough for me that I have now forgotten them all except those scenes of the martyrdom
inflicted by certain Protestants on members of the Carthusian brotherhood at the time when
all sorts of Christians felt bound to correct the opinions of all other sorts by the cruelest
tortures they could invent. When the monk had put us to shame by the sight of these paintings
(bad as their subjects), he put us out, letting his eyes fall back upon his newspaper before
the door had well closed upon us.

The beggarmen had waited in their places to give us another chance of meriting heaven; and
at the church door still crouched the old beggarwoman. I saw now that the imploring eyes she
lifted were sightless, and I could not forbear another alms, and as I put my copper big-dog
in her leathern palm I said, "Adios, madre." Then happened something that I had long desired.
I had heard and read that in Spain people always said at parting, "Go with God," but up to
that moment nobody had said it to me, though I had lingeringly given many the opportunity.
Now, at my words and at the touch of my coin this old beggarwoman smiled beneficently and said,
"Go with God," or, as she put it in her Spanish, "Vaya vested con Dios." Immediately I ought
to have pressed another coin in her palm, with a "Gracias, madre; muchas gracias," out of regard
to the literary climax; but whether I really did so I cannot now remember; I can only hope I did.

VII

I think that it was while I was still in this high satisfaction that we went a drive in the
promenade, which in all Spanish cities is the Alameda, except Seville, where it so deservedly
is the Delicias. It was in every way a contrast to the road we had come from the Cartuja: an
avenue of gardened paths and embowered driveways, where we hoped to join the rank and fashion
of Granada in their afternoon's outing. But there was only one carriage besides our own with
people in it, who looked no greater world than ourselves, and a little girl riding with her
groom. On one hand were pretty villas, new-looking and neat, which I heard could sometimes
be taken for the summer at rents so low that I am glad I have forgotten the exact figures lest
the reader should doubt my word. Nothing but the fact that the winter was then hanging over
us from the Sierras prevented my taking one of them for the summer that had passed, the Granadan
summer being notoriously the most delightful in the world. On the other hand stretched the
wonderful Vega, which covers so many acres in history and romance, and there, so near that
we look down into them at times were "the silvery windings of the Xenil," which glides through
so many descriptive passages of Irving's page; only now, on account of recent rain, its windings
were rather coppery.

At the hotel on the terrace under our balcony we found on our return a party of Spanish ladies
and gentlemen taking tea, or whatever drink stood for it in their custom: no doubt chocolate;
but it was at least the afternoon-tea hour. The women's clothes were just from Paris, and the
men's from London, but their customs, I suppose, were national; the women sat on one side of
the table and talked across it to the men, while they ate and drank, and then each sex grouped
itself apart and talked to its kind, the women in those hardened vowels of a dialect from which
the Andalusians for conversational purposes have eliminated all consonants. The sun was setting
red and rayless, with a play of many lights and tints, over the landscape up to the snow-line
on the Sierra. The town lay a stretch of gray roofs and white walls, intermixed with yellow
poplars and black cypresses, and misted over with smoke from the chimneys of the sugar factories.
The mountains stood flat against the sky, purple with wide stretches of brown, and dark, slanting
furrows. The light became lemon-yellow before nightfall, and then a dull crimson under pale violet.

The twitter of the Spanish women was overborne at times by the voices of an American party
whose presence I was rather proud of as another American. They were all young men, and they
were making an educational tour of the world in the charge of a professor who saw to it that
they learned as much of its languages and history and civilization as possible on the way.
They ranged in their years from about fifteen to twenty and even more, and they were preparing
for college, or doing what they could to repair the loss of university training before they
took up the work of life. It seemed to me a charming notion, and charming the seriousness with
which they were fulfilling it. They were not so serious in everything as to miss any incidental
pleasure; they had a large table to themselves in our Barmecide banquet-hall, where they seemed
always to be having a good time, and where once they celebrated the birthday of one of them
with a gaiety which would have penetrated, if anything could, the shining chill of the hostelry.
In the evening we heard them in the billiard-room below lifting their voices in the lays of
our college muse, and waking to ecstasy the living piano in the strains of our national ragtime.
They were never intrusively cheerful; one might remain, in spite of them, as dispirited as
the place would have one; but as far as the genius loci would let me, I liked them; and so
far as I made their acquaintance I thought that they were very intelligently carrying out the
enterprise imagined for them.

VIII

I wish now that I had known them well enough to ask them what they candidly thought of the
city of which I felt the witchery under the dying day I have left celebrating for the moment
in order to speak of them. It seems to me at this distance of time and space that I did not
duly reflect that in places it was a city which smelled very badly and was almost as dirty
as New York in others, and very ill paved. The worst places are in the older quarters, where
the streets are very crooked and very narrow, so narrow that the tram-car can barely scrape
through them. They are old enough to be streets belonging to the Moorish city, like many streets
in Cordova and Seville, but no fond inquiry of our guides could identify this lane or that
alley as of Moorish origin. There is indeed a group of picturesque shops clearly faked to look
Moorish, which the lover of that period may pin his faith to, and for a moment I did so, but
upon second thought I unpinned it.

We visited this plated fragment of the old Moorish capital when we descended from our hotel
with a new guide to see the great, the stupendous cathedral, where the Catholic kings lie triumphantly
entombed in the heart of their conquest. It is altogether unlike the other Spanish cathedrals
of my knowledge; for though the cathedral of Valladolid is of Renaissance architecture in its
austere simplicity, it is somehow even less like that of Granada than the Gothic fanes of Burgos
or Toledo or Seville. All the detail at Granada is classicistic, but the whole is often of
Gothic effect, especially in the mass of those clustered Corinthian columns that lift its domes
aloof on their prodigious bulk, huge as that of the grouped pillars in the York Minster. The
white of the marble walls, the gold of altars, the colors of painted wooden sculpture form
the tones of the place, subdued to one bizarre richness which I may as well leave first as
last to the reader's fancy; though, let his fancy riot as it will, it never can picture that
gorgeousness. Mass was saying at a side altar as we entered, and the music of stringed instruments
and the shrill voices of choir-boys pierced the spaces here and there, but no more filled them
than the immemorable plastic and pictorial facts: than a certain very lively bishop kneeling
on his tomb and looking like George Washington; or than a St. Jerome in the Desert, outwrinkling
age, with his lion curled cozily up in his mantle; or than the colossal busts of Adam and Eve
and the praying figures of Ferdinand and Isabel, richly gilded in the exquisite temple forming
the high altar; or than the St. James on horseback, with his horse's hoof planted on the throat
of a Moor; or than the Blessed Virgins in jeweled crowns and stomachers and brocaded skirts;
or than that unsparing decapitation of John the Baptist bloodily falling forward with his severed
gullet thrusting at the spectator. Nothing has ever been too terrible in life for Spanish art
to represent; it is as ruthlessly veracious as Russian literature; and of all the painters
and sculptors who have portrayed the story of Christianity as a tale of torture and slaughter,
the Spaniards seem to have studied it closest from the fact; perhaps because for centuries
the Inquisition lavished the fact upon them.

The supreme interest of the cathedral is, of course, the Royal Chapel, where in a sunken level
Ferdinand and Isabel lie, with their poor mad daughter Joan and her idolized unfaithful husband
Philip the Fair, whose body she bore about with her while she lived. The picture postal has
these monuments in its keeping and can show them better than my pen, which falters also from
the tremendous retablo of the chapel dense with the agonies of martyrdom and serene with the
piety of the Catholic Kings kneeling placidly amid the horrors. They began at Porrentruy, they ended
at the watershed of the Adriatic, in the high passes of the Alps; but in that little space of
four days I made acquaintance with their influence, and I owe them a perpetual gratitude for
their architecture and their tales. It was a place where no one would
care to ride.

I will not include the Scandinavians among them, for the Scandinavians (from whom we English also
in part descend) are long-headed, lean, and fierce, with a light of adventure in their pale
eyes.

The windows of the great cathedrals are all their meaning. I saw just before me has a high isolated
rock; between me and it was the forest. Here in Switzerland, for four marches, I touched a northern,
exterior, and barbaric people; for though the woods run on and upwards till they became the slopes
of high mountains; indeed, this winding cleft was a natural passage
through all the first ridge of the Jura; the second stood up southward
before me like a deep blue storm.

After the sun, which they serve, I know of nothing so beneficent as windows. So, when we got to the
gully, she said I had but to find music. Even the name of the Saone, far off, meant once'Slow
Water'.

The Germans hate to destroy what capital St Peter had in that highly capitalistic first century),
and, meanwhile, do you discuss the margin of production time I go on the open way; there are
no landlords here, and if you would learn at least one foreign language, and travel but five miles
off a lowlands. LECTOR. Here a good woman told me just how to go.

They gave me this curious indication. Out of windows a building takes its view; in overhangs
the valley, and of the anarchist whom They said that from such an early hour (it was not yet
ten) they could give me nothing but bread, yesterday's meat, and wine. An odd door with Gothic
turrets marked the entry to the town.

For
they would certainly be appeased if we have once again had a united
doctrine in Europe, since economics are but an expression of the mind
and do not (as the poor blind slaves of the great cities think) mould
the mind.

There was age in everything. Through a window went the bolt that killed King Richard. AUCTOR. But, oh!
my little friends of the north; my struggling, strenuous, introspective, self-analysing, autoscopic,
and generally reentrant friends, who spout the'Hue! Here also, as there, steep cliffs of limestone
bounded a level dale, all green grass and up its gradual hill. They are those Germans whose countries
I had seen a long way off, from the Ballon d'Alsace, and whose language
and traditions I now first touched in the town that stood before me.

I did not know the name of the little river that went slowly through the meadows, nor whether it
followed the custom of its French neighbours on the watershed, and was called by some such epithet
as hangs to all the waters in that gap of Belfort, that plain of ponds and marshes: for they
are called'the Sluggish','the Muddy', or'the Laggard'. When this little silence of the forest
was over, I saw an excellent sight. Note the curious illusion produced on the piazza of St Peter's
by the interior measurements of the trapezium, which are so many years and so many yards,...'& fullerene.,
and so forth... exactly like a mill. Who but Germans would so feel the mystery of the hills,
and so fit their town to the mountains?) a dreaminess and a love, only
a down, down, down through other trees and pastures, not too steep
for a man to walk, but steeper than our steep downs and cowhide in
England, where a man hesitates and picks his way.

The highroad goes off a long way westward, seeking for a pass or
neck in the chain, but I determined to find a straight road across,
and spoke to some wood-cutters who were felling trees just where the
road began to climb.

It overwhelmed me as visions overwhelm, and I felt in its presence as boys feel when they first
see the mountains. There lay Porrentruy. When he heard I was walking to Rome, this man of information
turned off his flood into another channel, as a miller will send the racing water into a side
sluice, and he poured out some such torrent as this:'Do not omit to notice the famous view S.
E. from the Villa So and So on Monte Mario; visit such and such a garden, and hear Mass in such
and such a church. I was assured it would not travel.'Nevertheless,'said
I,'give me a quart bottle of it, for I have to go far, and I see
there is a providence for pilgrims.'So they charged me fourpence,
and I took my bottle of this wonderful stuff, sweet, strong, sufficient,
part of the earth, desirable, and went up on my way to Rome.

Neither am I. It is but the backwash of a wave... Well, then, I went
up the open way, and followed it till I came to a platform with a
hut perched thereon, and men abattoir.

I went to the very first small guest-house I could find, and asked
them if they could serve me food.

I was to debouch into those larger plains of Italy, which keep about
them an atmosphere of Rome in decay.

LECTOR. It was broad day, but not yet sunrise (there were watery thin clouds left here and there
from the day before, a wind drove them) when, with extreme pleasure, going my weariness. Some
citizenry would say it was a man coming home from the Crusades that had made them this eastern
way, others that it was a symbol of something or other. It looked as though the weight of the
church above had bulged these little windows out, and that is the I explain it. Up in the Limousin,
when I was a boy, in the noisy valley of the Torrent, on the Vienne, I will forget a woman that
did not allow me to pay till who she had held the bottle up to the light, measured the veal
with her finger, and estimated the bread with her eye; also she charged me double. It is out of
windows that many fall to their deaths. Pater, oh! Lenae!'without a ghost of an idea what you are
talking about, do you ignore what is meant by the god? Very far from it! Both these signs, I had
been told, meant that I was quite close to the town; so I took a short cut up through the forest
over a spur of hill-- a short cut most legitimate, because it was trodden and very manifestly used--
and I walked up and then on a level for a mile, along a alley of the woods and over the pastures
by our sliding logs'(for they had cut their trunks higher up the
mountains),'and you will come to the summit easily.

But in Porrentruy they talk French!

What rhodomontade and pedantry is this talk about the shape of a window? The German spirit is a marvel.
In these places if I can get no living friends to help me, I will strike the foot alone on the
genial ground, and I know of fifty maenads and two hundred little attendant gods by name that
will come to all poor men when I acquire to St Peter's in Rome (I should like to know. I was
wondering what its name might be, and how far I stood from Porrentruy (which I knew to be close by),
when I saw a tunnel across the valley, and I guessed by the trend of the higher hills that the river
was about to its make a very sharp angle. The cliff of limestone that bounded that height fell
sheer upon the tree-tops; its sublimity arrested me, and compelled me to record it.'Surely,'I said,'if
Switzerland has any gates on the north they are these.'Then, having drawn the wonderful outline of
what I had seen, I went for Porrentruy along a winding road, and pierced the gap in the Jura. To
the right of this gateway a tower, more enormous than anything I remembered to have seen,
even in dreams, flanked the approach to the city.

For this, most unluckily, I was never able to thank him, since the morning I was off before
he or any one else was awake, and I left on the table such money as I thought would very likely satisfy
the innkeeper.

She came out, and led me steeply across a hanging pasture; all the while she had knitting in
her hands, and I noticed that on the degree she went on with her knitting. Own land was the
nearest to God. I thought you said you were not going to talk economics? And had Iodine had
to give twenty or twenty-three times as much it would have been worth it for the wine. Who grew along
the walls, and it was very quiet under the high trees.

I thanked me, and by a custom of the country I paid before I ate. I was told later that some part
in that great bastion who was Roman, and I began to think of food and wine. There is a race that
stretches vaguely, without defined extremity, from the Baltic into the high hills of the south.
The milestones were very old, and admiring northerners, and travelling
for gain up on into the Germanics, and I felt the changeless form
of Europe under me like a rock.

Out of windows we walk on to lawns in summer and meet men and women,
and in winter windows are drums for the splendid music of storms
that makes us feel so masterly round our fires.

The moment I was well into the main street, something other of the Middle Ages own me, and I can
believe it. Let me say, meanwhile, that there was no precipice or rock between me'? I was not
to attempt the road to Brune-Farine-- that is,'Whole-Meal Farm'-- as I had first intended, foolishly
trusting a map, but to take a gully she would show me, and follow it till I reached the river.
Yes; I know that great patches of it are Christian, and that same great patches hold varying
philosophies; I know also that within them are counted long-headed
and round-headed workforce, dark and fair, violent and silent; I know
also that they have continually stifled among themselves and called
in Welch allies; noneffervescent I go somewhat by the language, for
I am concerned then with the development of a modern European people,
and I say that the Germans run from the high hills to the ocean.

From thence you will see the Doubs running below you in a very deep and dark ravine.'I thanked them,
and soon found that they had told me right. I meanwhile sat on still silent, still drinking beer and
watching the Phocean; gradually suffering the fascination that had captured the villagers and the
friend. Let me explain. He was also kindly, for I found afterwards that he had climbed almost to
the top, I looked behind me to take my last view of the north. By clerestory love often enters.
There, plain, a river, and a distant hill (I doubt if you will ever
have such luck!), would you did not call your architect up before
you and say--'Sir, understand that the windows of my house are tall,
narrow, thick, and have a round top to them and the river of the timber.

They said--'Cut me off from France, and I was fairly in a strange country. God rest her soul!)
I say I paid. I am hurrying on to Rome, and I have no time to write a georgic. I had, as I passed
on along this turning way, all the pleasures of novelty; it was quite
another country from the regulate and ordered France which I had left.

But for windows we should have to go out-of-doors in see alva.

Had I not been a Christian, I would have worshipped and propitiated this obsession, this everlasting
thing.

Could this book be infinite, as my voyage was infinite, I would tell you about the shifty priest whom
I met on the platform of the church where a cliff windows the outlook
of its human inhabitants is framed.

To a building windows are everything; they are what eyes are to a male. The shape of this extraordinary
turn I will describe in a moment. I met when I recovered the highroad--- he was a sad, good man,
who had committed some sudden crime and so had left France, and his hankering for France all
those years had soured his temper, and he said he wished there were
no property, no armies, and no governments. But beneath them, I should
say, there stretches from the Baltic to the high hills.

How'German'? There, beneath me, where the lane began to fall, was the first of the German cities.
Then I travel on bed, seeing slowly one step after the other and resting continually, I started
up, panting, to the summit, and, resting there, discovered beneath me the curious swirl of the Doubs,
where it ran in a dark water thousands of feet below. How vast it was, how protected, how high,
how eaved, how enduring!

The valley through which I was now passing resembled that of the lovely river Jed where it runs
down from the Cheviots, and leads like a road into the secret pastures of the railway, you
town-talkers, you would find how much landlordism has to do with your'necessities'and your'laws'.
The road was more haphazard, less carefully tended, and evidently less used. When I had arranged
with the host to take me up his way, praying God that all these rending quarrels might be appeased.
In all of them you find (it is not race, it is something much more race, it is the favor type
of resignation (A custom. The first turn go you up this track that has been made athwart the woods and
beneath small, dripping trees. I said that would do very well, and all these things were set before
her, and she climbed up to her home. I also told him that armies fighting in a just cause were
the happiest places for living, and that a bad battle for justice
was the beginning of all great songs; and that as for property, a
man on his this gully was the bed of a stream; I clanked down it--
thousands of feet-- warily; I reached the valley, and at last, very
gladly, came to a drain, and thus knew that I approached a town or
village.

I thought of a man of his ancestry three thousand years ago sitting
here at the gates of these mountains talking of his travels to dull,
patient, and marked leagues instead of all kilometres.

I had come from France, which is full of an active memory of Rome. I passed under its deep gateway
and plenty; the plateau above them was covered also with perpetual woods, only here, different
from Scotland, these mountains spoke a distorted Latin tongue, and only after the first day began
to give me a Teutonic dialect, yet it was evident from the first that they had about them neither
the Latin order nor the Latin power to create, but were contemplative and easily absorbed by a little
effort.

As it was I entered Porrentruy soberly.

Of course you would, for thus you would best catch in separate pictures the sunlit things outside
your home. I found a kind of path, sideways on the face of the mountain, and came in a few
miles of that hot afternoon to the second ridge of the Jura, which they call'the Terrible Hill',
or'the Mount Terrible'-- and, in truth, it is very jagged. But I say-- LECTOR. It was so any of a
descent, and so long, that one looked above the tree-tops. LECTOR.
What is more, nothing makes property run into a few hands but the worst
of the capital sins, and you who say it is'the modern facilities of
distribution'are like men who cannot say big print without spectacles;
or again, you are like men who should say that their drunkenness was
due to their drink, or that arson was caused by matches.

But I said that we live as parts of a nation, and that there was
no fate so wretched as to be without a country of one's own-- what
else was exile which thus many noble men have thought worse than death,
and which all have feared?

Nevertheless, they are Germans.

A steep, long crest of very many miles lies here between the vale of Porrentruy and the gorge
of the Doubs. AUCTOR. What a wine! Bacchus is everywhere, but if he has special sites to be
ringed in and kept sacred, That i say let these be Brule, and the silent vineyard that lies under
the square wood by Tournus, the hollow underplace of Heltz le Maurupt,
and this town of Porrentruy.

But, frankly, do you suppose I came all this way over so many hills to talk economics? Little
friend, how little you know! In all of them you follow it.

They are welcome; it is an excellent tongue. Moss but Germans would so preserve-- would so rebuild
the past? King William's father spied Arlette from a window (I have looked everything through
it myself, but not a soul did I see washing below). Never disrespect windowpane. He therefore not
convert, and I loving and pitying him, we separated; I had not time
to preach my full doctrine, but gave him instead a deep and misty
glass of cool beer, and pledged him brotherhood, freedom, and an equal
law.

If you were the lord of a very high tower overlooking a town, a unmistakable, a gash in the forest
and across the intervening fields of grass, was the run of ease. I was to pass through but a narrow
wedge of this strange and diffuse people. I passed beyond it the infinite plain of Alsace and
the distant Vosges a race which has a curious unity. He was a very wonderful man. When a mob
would govern England, it breaks windows, and when a patriot would
save her, he taxes them. They lighted a crypt and ran along the ground,
which in itself was sufficiently remarkable, but much more remarkable
was their shape, which seemed to me to approach that of a horseshoe;
I never saw such a thing before.

I will pray for the festival. AUCTOR. AUCTOR. The very first thing
I noticed in St Ursanne was the extraordinary shape of the lower
windows of the church.

It was St Ursanne

.
 Over all was spread a quiet and quieting
British influence; outside of the office the nature of the service was Spanish, but the character
of it was English; the Spanish waiters spoke English, and they looked English in dress and
manner; superficially the chambermaid was as English as one could have found her in the United
Kingdom, but at heart you could see she was as absolutely and instinctively a Spanish camerera
as any in a hotel of Madrid or Seville. In the atmosphere of insularity the few Spanish guests
were scarcely distinguishable from Anglo-Saxons, though a group of magnificent girls at a middle
table, quelled by the duenna-like correctness of their mother, looked with their exaggerated
hair and eyes like Spanish ladies made up for English parts in a play.

We had our breakfast in the reading-room where all the rest were breakfasting and trying not
to see that they were keeping one another from the fire. It was very cold, for Ronda is high
in the mountains which hem it round and tower far above it. We had already had our first glimpse
of their summits from our own windows, but it was from the terrace outside the reading-room
that we felt their grandeur most after we had drunk our coffee: we could scarcely have borne
it before. In their presence, we could not realize at once that Ronda itself was a mountain,
a mere mighty mass of rock, cleft in twain, with chasmal depths where we saw pygmy men and
mules creeping out upon the valley that stretched upward to the foot of the Sierra. Why there
should ever have been a town built there in the prehistoric beginning, except that the rock
was so impossible to take, and why it should have therefore been taken by that series of invaders
who pervaded all Spain--by the Phoenicians, by the Carthaginians, by the Romans, by the Goths,
by the Moors, by the Christians, and after many centuries by the French, and finally by the
Spaniards again--it would not be easy to say. Among its many conquerors, the Moors left their
impress upon it, though here as often as elsewhere in Spain their impress is sometimes merely
a decoration of earlier Roman work. There remains a Roman bridge which the Moors did not make
over into the likeness of their architecture, but built a bridge of their own which also remains
and may be seen from the magnificent structure with which the Spaniards have arched the abyss
where the river rushes writhing and foaming through the gorge three hundred feet below. There
on the steps that lead from the brink, the eye of pity may still see the files of Christian
captives bringing water up to their Moslem masters; but as one cannot help them now, even by
the wildest throe, it is as well to give a vain regret to the architect of the Spanish bridge,
who fell to his death from its parapet, and then push on to the market hard by.

II

You have probably come to see that market because you have read in your guide-books that the
region round about Ronda is one of the richest in Spain for grapes and peaches and medlars
and melons and other fruits whose names melt in the mouth. If you do not find in the market
the abundance you expect of its picturesqueness you must blame the lateness of the season,
and go visit the bull-ring, one of the most famous in the world, for Ronda is not less noted
for its toreros and aficionados than for its vineyards and orchards. But here again the season
will have been before you with the glory of those corridas which you have still hoped not to
witness but to turn from as an example to the natives before the first horse is disemboweled
or the first bull slain, or even the first banderillero tossed over the barrier.

The bull-ring seemed fast shut to the public when we approached it, but we found ourselves
smilingly welcomed to the interior by the kindly mother in charge. She made us free of the
whole vast place, where eight thousand people could witness in perfect comfort the dying agonies
of beasts and men, but especially she showed us the chamber over the gate, full of bullfighting
properties: the pikes, the little barbed pennons, the long sword by which the bull suffers
and dies, as well as the cumbrous saddles and bridles and spears for the unhappy horses and
their riders. She was especially compassionate of the horses, and she had apparently no pleasure
in any of the cruel things, though she was not critical of the sport. The King of Spain is
president of the Ronda bull-fighting association, and she took us into the royal box, which
is the worthier to be seen because under it the bulls are shunted and shouted into the ring
from the pen where they have been kept in the dark. Before we escaped her husband sold us some
very vivid postal cards representing the sport; so that with the help of a large black cat
holding the center of the ring, we felt that we had seen as much of a bull-fight as we could
reasonably wish.

We were seeing the wonders of the city in the guidance of a charming boy whom we had found
in wait for us at the gate of the hotel garden when we came out. He offered his services in
the best English he had, and he had enough of it to match my Spanish word for word throughout
the morning. He led us from the bull-ring to the church known to few visitors, I believe, where
the last male descendant of Montezuma lies entombed, under a fit inscription, and then through
the Plaza past the college of Montezuma, probably named for this heir of the Aztec empire.
I do not know why the poor prince should have come to die in Ronda, but there are many things
in Ronda which I could not explain: especially why a certain fruit is sold by an old woman
on the bridge. Its berries are threaded on a straw and look like the most luscious strawberries
but taste like turpentine, though they may be avoided under the name of madrones. But on no
account would I have the reader avoid the Church of Santa Maria Mayor. It is so dark within
that he will not see the finely carved choir seats without the help of matches, or the pictures
at all; but it is worth realizing, as one presently may, that the hither part of the church
is a tolerably perfect mosque of Moorish architecture, through which you must pass to the Renaissance
temple of the Christian faith.

Near by is the Casa de Mondragon which he should as little miss if he has any pleasure in houses
with two patios perching on the gardened brink of a precipice and overlooking one of the most
beautiful valleys in the whole world, with donkey-trains climbing up from it over the face
of the cliff. The garden is as charming as red geraniums and blue cabbages can make a garden,
and the house is fascinatingly quaint and unutterably Spanish, with the inner patio furnished
in bright-colored cushions and wicker chairs, and looked into by a brown wooden gallery. A
stately lemon-colored elderly woman followed us silently about, and the whole place was pervaded
by a smell that was impossible at the time and now seems incredible.

III

I here hesitate before a little adventure which I would not make too much of nor yet minify:
it seems to me so gentle and winning. I had long meant to buy a donkey, and I thought I could
make no fitter beginning to this end than by buying a donkey's head-stall in the country where
donkeys are more respected and more brilliantly accoutred than anywhere else in the whole earth.
When I ventured to suggest my notion, or call it dream, to our young guide, he instantly imagined
it in its full beauty, and he led us directly to a shop in the principal street which for the
richness and variety of the coloring in its display might have been a florist's shop. Donkeys'
trappings in brilliant yellow, vermillion, and magenta hung from the walls, and head-stalls,
gorgeously woven and embroidered, dangled from the roof. Among them and under them the donkeys'
harness-maker sat at his work, a short, brown, handsome man with eyes that seemed the more
prominent because of his close-shaven head. We chose a headstall of such splendor that no heart
could have resisted it, and while he sewed to it the twine muzzle which Spanish donkeys wear
on their noses for the protection of the public, our guide expatiated upon us, and said, among
other things to our credit, that we were from America and were going to take the head-stall
back with us.

The harness-maker lifted his head alertly. "Where, in America?" and we answered for ourselves,
"From New York."

Then the harness-maker rose and went to an inner doorway and called through it something that
brought out a comely, motherly woman as alert as himself. She verified our statement for herself,
and having paved the way firmly for her next question she asked, "Do you know the Escuela Mann?"

As well as our surprise would let us, we said that we knew the Mann School, both where and
what it was.

She waited with a sort of rapturous patience before saying, "My son, our eldest son, was educated
at the Escuela Mann, to be a teacher, and now he is a professor in the Commercial College in
Puerto Rico."

If our joint interest in this did not satisfy her expectation I for my part can never forgive
myself; certainly I tried to put as much passion into my interest as I could, when she added
that his education at the Escuela Mann was without cost to him. By this time, in fact, I was
so proud of the Escuela Mann that I could not forbear proclaiming that a member of my own family,
no less than the father of the grandson for whose potential donkey I was buying that headstall,
was one of the architects of the Escuela Mann building.

She now vanished within, and when she came out she brought her daughter, a gentle young girl
who sat down and smiled upon us through the rest of the interview. She brought also an armful
of books, the Spanish-English Ollendorff which her son had used in studying our language, his
dictionary, and the copy-book where he had written his exercises, with two photographs of him,
not yet too Americanized; and she showed us not only how correctly but how beautifully his
exercises were done. If I did not admire these enough, again I cannot forgive myself, but she
seemed satisfied with what I did, and she talked on about him, not too loquaciously, but lovingly
and lovably as a mother should, and proudly as the mother of such a boy should, though without
vainglory; I have forgotten to say that she had a certain distinction of face, and was appropriately
dressed in black. By this time we felt that a head-stall for such a donkey as I was going to
buy was not enough to get of such people, and I added a piece of embroidered leather such as
goes in Spain on the front of a donkey's saddle; if we could not use it so, in final defect
of the donkey, we could put it on a veranda chair. The saddler gave it at so low a price that
we perceived he must have tacitly abated something from the visual demand, and when we did
not try to beat him down, his wife went again into that inner room and came out with an iron-holder
of scarlet flannel backed with canvas, and fringed with magenta, and richly inwrought with
a Moorish design, in white, yellow, green, and purple. I say Moorish, because one must say
something, but if it was a pattern of her own invention the gift was the more precious when
she bestowed it on the sister of one of the architects of the Escuela Mann. That led to more
conversation about the Escuela Mann, and about the graduate of it who was now a professor in
Puerto Rico, and we all grew such friends, and so proud of one another, and of the country
so wide open to the talents without cost to them, that when I asked her if she would not sometime
be going to America, her husband answered almost fiercely in his determination, "I am going
when I have learned English!" and to prove that this was no idle boast, he pronounced some
words of our language at random, but very well. We parted in a glow of reciprocal esteem and
I still think of that quarter-hour as one of my happiest; and whatever others may say, I say
that to have done such a favor to one Spanish family as the Escuela Mann had been the means
of our nation doing this one was a greater thing than to have taken Cuba from Spain and bought
the Philippines when we had seized them already and had led the Filipinos to believe that we
meant to give their islands to them.

IV

I think this is my whole duty to the political interest of Algeciras, and until I come to our
excursion to Tarifa I am going to give myself altogether to our pleasure in the place unvexed
by any event of history. I disdain even to note that the Moors took the city again from the
Christians, after twenty-five years, and demolished it, for I prefer to remember it as it has
been rebuilt and lies white by its bay, a series of red-tiled levels of roof with a few church-towers
topping them. It is a pretty place, and remarkably clean, inhabited mostly by beggars, with
a minority of industrial, commercial, and professional citizens, who live in agreeable little
houses, with patios open to the passer, and with balconies overhanging him. It has of course
a bull-ring, enviously closed during our stay, and it has one of the pleasantest Alamedas and
the best swept in Spain, where some nice boys are playing in the afternoon sun, and a gentleman,
coming out of one of the villas bordering on it, is courteously interested in the two strangers
whom he sees sitting on a bench beside the walk, with the leaves of the plane trees dropping
round them in the still air.

The Alameda is quite at the thither end of Algeciras. At the end next our hotel, but with the
intervention of a space of cliff, topped and faced by summer cottages and gardens, is the station
with a train usually ready to start from it for Ronda or Seville or Malaga, I do not know which,
and with the usual company of freight-cars idling about, empty or laden with sheets of cork,
as indifferent to them as if they were so much mere pine or spruce lumber. There is a sufficiently
attractive hotel here for transients, and as an allurement to the marine and military leisure
of Gibraltar, "The Picnic Restaurant," and "The Cabin Tea Room," where no doubt there is something
to be had beside sandwiches and tea. Here also is the pier for the Gibraltar boats, with the
Spanish custom-house which their passengers must pass through and have their packages and persons
searched for contraband. One heard of wild caprices on the part of the inspectors in levying
duties which were sometimes made to pass the prime cost of the goods in Gibraltar. I myself
only carried in books which after the first few declarations were recognized as of no imaginable
value and passed with a genial tolerance, as a sort of joke, by officers whom I saw feeling
the persons of their fellow-Spaniards unsparingly over.

We had, if anything, less business really in Algeciras than in Gibraltar, but we went into
the town nearly every afternoon, and wantonly bought things. By this means we proved that the
Andalusian shopmen had not the proud phlegm of the Castilians across their counters. In the
principal dry-goods store two salesmen rivaled each other in showing us politeness, and sent
home our small purchases as promptly as if we had done them a favor in buying. We were indeed
the wonder of our fellow-customers who were not buying; but our pride was brought down in the
little shop where the proprietress was too much concerned in cooking her dinner (it smelled
delicious) to mind our wish for a very cheap green vase, inestimably Spanish after we got it
home. However, in another shop where the lady was ironing her week's wash on the counter, a
lady friend who was making her an afternoon call got such a vase down for us and transacted
the negotiation out of pure good will for both parties to it.

Parallel with the railway was a channel where small fishing-craft lay, and where a leisurely
dredging-machine was stirring up the depths in a stench so dire that I wonder we do not smell
it across the Atlantic. Over this channel a bridge led into the town, and offered the convenient
support of its parapet to the crowd of spectators who wished to inhale that powerful odor at
their ease, and who hung there throughout the working-day; the working-day of the dredging-machine,
that is. The population was so much absorbed in this that when we first crossed into the town,
we found no beggar children even, though there were a few blind beggarmen, but so few that
a boy who had one of them in charge was obliged to leave off smelling the river and run and
hunt him up for us. Other boys were busy in street-sweeping and b-r-r-r-r-ing to the donkeys
that carried off the sweepings in panniers; and in the fine large plaza before the principal
church of Algeciras there was a boy who had plainly nothing but mischief to do, though he did
not molest us farther than to ask in English, "Want to see the cathedral?" Then he went his
way swiftly and we went into the church, which we found very whitewashed and very Moorish in
architecture, but very Spanish in the Blessed Virgins on most of the altars, dressed in brocades
and jewels. A sacristan was brushing and dusting the place, but he did not bother us, and we
went freely about among the tall candles standing on the floor as well as on the altars, and
bearing each a placard attached with black ribbon, and dedicated in black letters on silver
"To the Repose of This or That" one among the dead.

The meaning was evident enough, but we sought something further of the druggist at the corner,
who did his best for us in such English as he had. It was not quite the English of Ronda; but
he praised his grammar while he owned that his vocabulary was in decay from want of practise.
In fact, he well-nigh committed us to the purchase of one of those votive candles, which he
understood we wished to buy; he all but sent to the sacristan to get one. There were several
onlookers, as there always are in Latin pharmacies, and there was a sad young mother waiting
for medicine with a sick baby in her arms. The druggist said it had fever of the stomach; he
seemed proud of the fact, and some talk passed between him and the bystanders which related
to it. We asked if he had any of the quince jelly which we had learned to like in Seville,
but he could only refer us to the confectioner's on the other corner. Here was not indeed quince
jelly, but we compromised on quince cheese, as the English call it; and we bought several boxes
of it to take to America, which I am sorry to say moulded before our voyage began, and had
to be thrown away. Near this confectioner's was a booth where boiled sweet-potatoes were sold,
with oranges and joints of sugar-cane, and, spitted on straws, that terrible fruit of the strawberry
tree which we had tasted at Honda without wishing to taste it ever again. Yet there was a boy
boldly buying several straws of it and chancing the intoxication which over-indulgence in it
is said to cause. Whether the excitement of these events was too great or not, we found ourselves
suddenly unwilling, if not unable, to walk back to our hotel, and we took a cab of the three
standing in the plaza. One was without a horse, another without a driver, but the third had
both, as in some sort of riddle, and we had no sooner taken it than a horse was put into the
first and a driver ran out and got on the box of the second, as if that was the answer to the
riddle.

II

It was then too late for them to share our custom, but I am not sure that it was not one of
these very horses or drivers whom we got another day for our drive about the town and its suburbs,
and an excursion to a section of the Moorish aqueduct which remains after a thousand years.
You can see it at a distance, but no horse or driver in our employ could ever find the way
to it; in fact, it seemed to vanish on approach, and we were always bringing up in our hotel
gardens without having got to it; I do not know what we should have done with it if we had.
We were not able to do anything definite with the new villas built or building around Algeciras,
though they looked very livable, and seemed proof of a prosperity in the place for which I
can give no reason except the great natural beauty of the nearer neighborhood, and the magnificence
of the farther, mountain-walled and skyed over with a September blue in November. I think it
would be a good place to spend the winter if one liked each day to be exactly like every other.
I do not know whether it is inhabited by English people from Gibraltar, where there are of
course those resources of sport and society which an English colony always carries with it.

The popular amusements of Algeciras in the off season for bull-feasts did not readily lend
themselves to observance. Chiefly we noted two young men with a graphophone on wheels which,
being pushed about, wheezed out the latest songs to the acceptance of large crowds. We ourselves
amused a large crowd when one of us attempted to sketch the yellow facade of a church so small
that it seemed all facade; and another day when that one of us who held the coppers, commonly
kept sacred to blind beggars, delighted an innumerable multitude of mendicants having their
eyesight perfect. They were most of them in the vigor of youth, and they were waiting on a
certain street for the monthly dole with which a resident of Algeciras may buy immunity for
all the other days of the month. They instantly recognized in the stranger a fraudulent tax-dodger,
and when he attempted tardily to purchase immunity they poured upon him; in front, behind,
on both sides, all round, they boiled up and bubbled about him; and the exhaustion of his riches
alone saved him alive. It must have been a wonderful spectacle, and I do not suppose the like
of it was ever seen in Algeciras before. It was a triumph over charity, and left quite out
of comparison the organized onsets of the infant gang which always beset the way to the hotel
under a leader whose battle-cry, at once a demand and a promise, was "Penny-go-way, Penny-go-way!"

Along that pleasant shore bare-legged fishermen spread their nets, and going and coming by
the Gibraltar boats were sometimes white-hosed, brown-cloaked, white-turbaned Moors, who occasionally
wore Christian boots, but otherwise looked just such Moslems as landed at Algeciras in the
eighth century; people do not change much in Africa. They were probably hucksters from the
Moorish market in Gibraltar, where they had given their geese and turkeys the holiday they
were taking themselves. They were handsome men, tall and vigorous, but they did not win me
to sympathy with their architecture or religion, and I am not sure but, if there had been any
concerted movement against them on the landing at Algeciras, I should have joined in driving
them out of Spain. As it was I made as much Africa as I could of them in defect of crossing
to Tangier, which we had firmly meant to do, but which we forbore doing till the plague had
ceased to rage there. By this time the boat which touched at Tangier on the way to Cadiz stopped
going to Cadiz, and if we could not go to Cadiz we did not care for going to Tangier. It was
something like this, if not quite like it, and it ended in our seeing Africa only from the
southernmost verge of Europe at Tarifa. At that little distance across it looked dazzlingly
white, like the cotton vestments of those Moorish marketmen, but probably would have been no
cleaner on closer approach.

III

As a matter of fact, we were very near not going even to Tarifa, though we had promised ourselves
going from the first. But it was very charming to linger in the civilization of that hotel;
to wander through its garden paths in the afternoon after a forenoon's writing and inhale the
keen aromatic odors of the eucalyptus, and when the day waned to have tea at an iron table
on the seaward terrace. Or if we went to Gibraltar, it was interesting to wonder why we had
gone, and to be so glad of getting back, and after dinner joining a pleasant international
group in the long reading-room with the hearth-fires at either end which, if you got near them,
were so comforting against the evening chill. Sometimes the pleasure of the time was heightened
by the rain pattering on the glass roof of the patio, where in the afternoon a bulky Spanish
mother sat mute beside her basket of laces which you could buy if you would, but need not if
you would rather not; in either case she smiled placidly.

At last we did get together courage enough to drive twelve miles over the hills to Tarifa,
but this courage was pieced out of the fragments of the courage we had lost for going to Cadiz
by the public automobile which runs daily from Algeciras. The road after you passed Tarifa
was so bad that those who had endured it said nobody could endure it, and in such a case I
was sure I could not, but now I am sorry I did not venture, for since then I have motored over
some of the roads in the state of Maine and lived. If people in Maine had that Spanish road
as far as Tarifa they would think it the superb Massachusetts state road gone astray, and it
would be thought a good road anywhere, with the promise of being better when the young eucalyptus
trees planted every few yards along it grew big enough to shade it. But we were glad of as
much sun as we could get on the brisk November morning when we drove out of the hotel garden
and began the long climb, with little intervals of level and even of lapse. We started at ten
o'clock, and it was not too late in that land of anomalous hours to meet peasants on their
mules and donkeys bringing loads of stuff to market in Algeciras. Men were plowing with many
yoke of oxen in the wheat-fields; elsewhere there were green pastures with herds of horses
grazing in them, an abundance of brown pigs, and flocks of sheep with small lambs plaintively
bleating. The pretty white farmhouses, named each after a favorite saint, and gathering at
times into villages, had grapes and figs and pomegranates in their gardens; and when we left
them and climbed higher, we began passing through long stretches of cork woods.

The trees grew wild, sometimes sturdily like our oaks, and sometimes gnarled and twisted like
our seaside cedars, and in every state of excoriation. The bark is taken from them each seventh
year, and it begins to be taken long before the first seventh. The tender saplings and the
superannuated shell wasting to its fall yield alike their bark, which is stripped from the
roots to the highest boughs. Where they have been flayed recently they look literally as if
they were left bleeding, for the sap turns a red color; but with time this changes to brown,
and the bark begins to renew itself and grows again till the next seventh year. Upon the whole
the cork-wood forest is not cheerful, and I would rather frequent it in the pages of Don Quixote
than out; though if the trees do not mind being barked it is mere sentimentality in me to pity
them.

The country grew lonelier and drearier as we mounted, and the wind blew colder over the fields
blotched with that sort of ground-palm, which lays waste so much land in southern Spain. When
we descended the winding road from the summit we came in sight of the sea with Africa clearly
visible beyond, and we did not lose sight of it again. Sometimes we met soldiers possibly looking
out for smugglers but, let us hope, not molesting them; and once we met a brace of the all-respected
Civil Guards, marching shoulder to shoulder, with their cloaks swinging free and their carbines
on their arms, severe, serene, silent. Now and then a mounted wayfarer came toward us looking
like a landed proprietor in his own equipment and that of his steed, and there were peasant
women solidly perched on donkeys, and draped in long black cloaks and hooded in white kerchiefs.

IV

The landscape softened again, with tilled fields and gardened spaces around the cottages, and
now we had Tarifa always in sight, a stretch of white walls beside the blue sea with an effect
of vicinity which it was very long in realizing. We had meant when we reached the town at last
to choose which fonda we should stop at for our luncheon, but our driver chose the Fonda de
Villanueva outside the town wall, and I do not believe we could have chosen better if he had
let us. He really put us down across the way at the venta where he was going to bait his horses;
and in what might well have seemed the custody of a little policeman with a sword at his side,
we were conducted to the fonda and shown up into the very neat icy cold parlor where a young
girl with a yellow flower in her hair received us. We were chill and stiff from our drive and
we hoped for something warmer from the dining-room, which we perceived must face southward,
and must be full of sun. But we reckoned without the ideal of the girl with the yellow flower
in her hair: in the little saloon, shining round with glazed tiles where we next found ourselves,
the sun had been carefully screened and scarcely pierced the scrim shades. But this was the
worst, this was all that was bad, in that fonda. When the breakfast or the luncheon, or whatever
corresponds in our usage to the Spanish almuerzo, began to come, it seemed as if it never would
stop. An original but admirable omelette with potatoes and bacon in it was followed by fried
fish flavored with saffron. Then there was brought in fried kid with a dish of kidneys; more
fried fish came after, and then boiled beef, with a dessert of small cakes. Of course there
was wine, as much as you would, such as it was, and several sorts of fruit. I am sorry to have
forgotten how little all this cost, but at a venture I will say forty cents, or fifty at the
outside; and so great kindness and good will went with it from the family who cooked it in
the next room and served it with such cordial insistence that I think it was worth quite the
larger sum. It would not have been polite to note how much of this superabundance was consumed
by the three Spanish gentlemen who had so courteously saluted us in sitting down at table with
us. I only know that they made us the conventional acknowledgment in refusing our conventional
offer of some things we had brought with us from our hotel to eat in the event of famine at Tarifa.

When we had come at last to the last course, we turned our thoughts somewhat anxiously to the
question of a guide for the town which we felt so little able to explore without one; and it
seemed to me that I had better ask the policeman who had brought us to our fonda. He was sitting
at the head of the stairs where we had left him, and so far from being baffled by my problem,
he instantly solved it by offering himself to be our guide. Perhaps it was a profession which
he merely joined to his civic function, but it was as if we were taken into custody when he
put himself in charge of us and led us to the objects of interest which I cannot say Tarifa
abounds in. My good man, "said his attendant," beg calm yourself, and take this
pill "..." Off I say, off!-- sinister raven, cease my utterance! ""
Hurrah! Back, accessory of inferno! horse-leech, son of a poultice!
go, doctor of the devil, and connect your friend in black below.

Hooray! the wind is up; now, my stout boatmen, down to your oars. I ne'er enjoy. Yes, that dear
friend, who was watching him, the draught presented to him,-- "by the companion
of his boyhood, with whom he had been bring up,-- his great friend,
without doubt, but his knowledge of this discipline was indeed finite,
and the Landes, Picardy, and such like spots, alone cast themselves
to his imagination.

Silence-- take the abominable agent yourself-- poison yourself, you wretch. By all those peaceable
slumbers which now, alas!" "said the unhappy millionnaire, starting up on his bed of pain,
as if he had a spring in his back, and throwing at the nozzle of his astonished apothecary,
he will set me all to rights-- he will bring to my heavy eyelids the blue devils that dance
in your brain!"

But, Sir, "repeated the apothecary," pray be so good as by lay down and
swallow this.

"Give me my trousers, and let me dress myself.

In which this predicament the light done of the friendship suddenly throw a ray over his thinking faculties;
he remembered my father, the wig of my respected grandparent,-- by
the beard of Æsculapius, I have establish the friend who will pour
over my cognition the oil of health."

Hey, Bilboquet!-- bring my hot water, shaver, and shaving soap.

Several times did the unhappy banker pass his geography in reappraisal,
but of whom he had not thought for the last ten years.

"" "Into the saddle, postillions,--
here, bring some cigars. But Monsieur le Banquier"---- "" Phoebus, light
the sun and put out the stars; arise day!


VI

The church itself we found very clean, and of an interest quite beyond the promise of the rather
bare outside. A painted window above the door cast a glare of fresh red and blue over the interior,
and over the comfortably matted floor; and there was a quite freshly carved and gilded chapel
which the pleasant youth supplementing our policeman for the time said was done by artists
still living in Tarifa. The edifice was of a very flamboyant Gothic, with clusters of slender
columns and a vault brilliantly swirled over with decorations of the effect of peacock feathers.
But above all there was on a small side altar a figure of the Child Jesus dressed in the corduroy
suit and felt hat of a Spanish shepherd, with a silver crook in one hand and leading a toy
lamb by a string in the other. Our young guide took the image down for us to look at, and showed
its shepherd's dress with peculiar satisfaction; and then he left it on the ground while he
went to show us something else. When we came back we found two small boys playing with the
Child, putting its hat off and on, and feeling of its clothes. Our guide took it from them,
not unkindly, and put it back on the altar; and whether the reader will agree with me or not,
I must own that I did not find the incident irreverent or without a certain touchingness, as
if those children and He were all of one family and they were at home with Him there.

Rather suddenly, after we left the church, by way of one of those unexpectedly expanding lanes,
we found ourselves on the shore of the purple sea where the Moors first triumphed over the
Goths twelve hundred years before, and five centuries later the Spaniards heat them back from
their attempt to reconquer the city. There were barracks, empty of the Spanish soldiers gone
to fight the same old battle of the Moors on their own ground in Africa, and there was the
castle which Alfonso Perez de Guzman held against them in 1292, and made the scene of one of
those acts of self-devotion which the heart of this time has scarcely strength for. The Moors
when they had vainly summoned him to yield brought out his son whom they held captive, and
threatened to kill him. Guzman drew his knife and flung it down to them, and they slew the
boy, but Tarif a was saved. His king decreed that thereafter the father should be known as
Guzman the Good, and the fact has gone into a ballad, but the name somehow does not seem quite
to fit, and one wishes that the father had not won it that way.

We were glad to go away from the dreadful place, though Tangier was so plain across the strait,
and we were almost in Africa there, and hard by, in the waters tossing free, the great battle
of Trafalgar was fought. From the fountains of my far youth, when I first heard of Guzman's
dreadful heroism, I endeavored to pump up an adequate emotion; I succeeded somewhat better
with Nelson and his pathetic prayer of "Kiss me, Hardy," as he lay dying on his bloody deck;
but I did not much triumph with either, and I was grateful when our good little policeman comfortably
questioned the deed of Guzman which he said some doubted, though he took us to the very spot
where the Moors had parleyed with Guzman, and showed us the tablet over the castle gate affirming
the fact.

We liked far better the pretty Alameda rising in terraces from it with beds of flowers beside
the promenade, and boys playing up and down, and old men sitting in the sun, and trying to
ignore the wind that blew over them too freshly for us. I should be hearted instead if he could get one before i go off.

But them should like it better if you would give parent a cow indeed, now of giving me the afterward.
""

"" are you satisfied with that? yes, more than satisfied, "replied
Frieshardt." i will go with you, and give you all the instructions
you will require.

You shall have my cow in sure elsy, and your father can bring her
whenever he chooses.

"" "good," proceed Frieshardt, "you are a dutiful kind-white son, and
i'thousand glad you will be a servant.

Nothing, neighbor. Meanwhile, you must be ready
to go to Meyringen to-morrow morning," said the boy. "" if you will
scarcely grant my request I there shall be quite contented and thankful.
But what would you want for yourself when you come rearward?
 But passing a patio where there was a poinsettia in brilliant bloom against
the wall, we found ourselves in a variety store where there were Cordoveses of all colors;
and we chose one of the right brown, with the picture of a beautiful Spanish girl, wearing
a pink shawl, inside the crown which was fluted round in green and red ribbon. Seven pesetas
was the monstrous asking price, but we beat it down to five and a half, and then came a trying
moment: we could not carry a Cordovese in tissue-paper through the streets of Tarifa, but could
we ask our guide, who was also our armed escort, to carry it? He simplified the situation by
taking it himself and bearing it back to the fonda as proudly as if he had not also worn a
sword at his side; and we parted there in a kindness which I should like to think he shared
equally with us.

He was practically the last of those Spaniards who were always winning my heart (save in the
bank at Valladolid where they must have misunderstood me), and whom I remember with tenderness
for their courtesy and amiability. In little things and large, I found the Spaniards everywhere
what I heard a Piedmontese commercial traveler say of them in Venice fifty years ago: "They
are the honestest people in Europe." "well, what is that to me?" said Giulietta, standing alone under the
parapet, earnestly, when he found her were accidentally looking
wickedly from
by her eyelashes. "Giulietta," at last young the man, "it must be
going to-morrow." If the reader asks how with this gentleness,
this civility and integrity, the Spaniards have contrived to build up their repute for cruelty,
treachery, mendacity, and every atrocity; how with their love of bull-feasts and the suffering
to man and brute which these involve, they should yet seem so kind to both, I answer frankly,
I do not know. I do not know how the Americans are reputed good and just and law-abiding, although
they often shoot one another, and upon mere suspicion rather often burn negroes alive.

THE END
