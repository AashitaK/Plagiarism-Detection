Right Worshipfull:

In these last dayes, and perillous times, among the rest of those dreadfull euills, which are
fore-told should abound[a] in them, a close & disguised contempt of religion may be iustly
accounted as chiefe, which causeth and bringeth vpon men all disastrous effects, when although
it be shadowed with a beautifull Maske of holines, faire tongued: yet false-harted,[b] professing
they know God, but in works deny him. And among these there be two especiall sorts; the one,
who entertaining a stubborne, and curious rash boldnes, striue by the iudgem[~e]t of reason,
to search ouer-deeply into the knowledge of those things which are farre aboue the reach of
any humane capacitie. And so making shipwracke in this deep and vnfoundable Sea, ouerwhelme
themselues in the gulfe thereof. The other kind is more sottish, dull, and of a slow wit, and
therefore ouer-credulous, beleeuing euerie thing, especially when they be carried by the violent
tempest of their desires, and other vngouerned affections; and among these the diuell vsually
spreadeth his netts, as assured of a prey, wayting closely if hee can espie any, who either
grow discontented and desperate, through want and pouerty, or be exasperated with a wrathfull
and vnruly passion of reuenge, or transported by vnsatiable loue to obtaine some thing they
desire; and these hee taking aduantage, assaulteth with golden and glorious promises, to performe
vnto them the wishes of their owne hearts; the drift whereof is (hee being as at the first
incased in a subtile Serpents skinne) onely to enthrall and invassall them slaues to himselfe.
The first of these mentioned, are slie and masked Atheists, who ouer-shadow their secret impiety,
loose and dissolute behauiour with some outward conformitie and shew of religion, snatching
(as they thinke) a sufficient warrantize thereof from those disorders they obserue among men,
and therfore passe vncensured, hauing a ciuill, but dissembled carriage. The second be Sorcerers,
Wisards, Witches, and the rest of that ranke and kindred: no small multitude swarming now in
the world, yet supposed of many, rather worthy pitty then punishment, as deluded by fantasies,
and mis-led, not effecting those harmes wherewith they bee charged, or themselues acknowledge.
But considering they be ioyned and linked together with Satan in a league (the common and professed
enemy of mankinde) and by his helpe performe many subtile mischieuous actions, and hurtfull
designes, it is strange that from so great a smoake arising, they neither descrie nor feare
some fire. And therefore, in respect of these, I haue at your appointment and request (for
whom I am most willing to bestow my best labours and euer shall be) penned this small Treatise,
occasioned by the detection of a late witch among you, whose irreligious care, and vnwearied
industry, is not to be defrauded of deserued commendation, and by mature deliberation, and
descreete search, found out her irreligious and impious demeanour, and also discouered sundry
her vnnaturall and inhumane mischiefes done to others, whereof being conuicted, she was accordingly
sentenced, and did vndergoe the penalty iustly appointed, and due by Law vnto malefactors of
that kinde. After all which, you kindled with a holy zeale of the aduauncement of Gods glorie,
and giuing satisfaction to euery one howsoeuer affected, intermitted no meanes, vsing therein
the labour of your carefull Ministers (willingly offering themselues in this holy seruice)
whereby she might be broght (as one conuerted in the last houre) to the sight & acknowledgement
of her heinous sins in generall, & particularly of that of witchcraft, confessing the same,
& by true repentance, and embracing of the tender mercies of God in Christ Iesus saue her soule
(who refuseth no true and vnfained conuert at any time.) And hee gratiously blessing these
religious endeuors of yours, vouchsafed to second the same with a happy and wished for euent,
which (as I hope) shall appeare manifestly in the following Treatise vnto all those who are
not fondly, & without cause, too much wedded to their owne conceits: And thus, desiring GOD
most humbly to confirme and strengthen you in his truth, which euer you haue loued, and is
your due praise, and shall be at the last an honour vnto you: I rest

            Your Worships in all Christian duty
                     to be commaunded,

To the Reader.

Christian Reader, I haue vpon occasion penned this short discourse, and that of such a subject
wherewith not being well acquainted, am enforced to craue some direction from those, whose
names you shall finde remembred in the same: (that I be not vnthankefull vnto those from whom
I receiue instruction) and haue in former time, and latter dayes, taken paines in searching
out, both the speculatiue, and practique parts of this damnable Art of Witchcraft, a dangerous
and seducing inuention of Sathan, who from the Arcenals, and Magisins store-houses of his ancient
and mischieuous furniture, hath not spared to affoord all helpe, and the best Engines for the
subuerting of soules, pliable to his allurements: and to this end, beside a plaine narration
of fact in this case committed and confessed, (least the Treatise should be too bare and naked)
I haue added thereunto a few Propositions, agreeing to such a subiect matter, manifesting some
speciall poynts not altogether impertinent in my opinion, nor vnworthy of due consideration:
I know mine owne wants, and do as willingly acknowledge them: One more experienced, and of
greater leasure, and better health, had beene fitter for the opening and discouering of so
deepe a mystery, and hidden secret of Iniquity, as this is; and haply hereafter may be willing
to take that taske in hand: yet herein thou shalt finde something not vsuall: A manifest contract
made with the Diuell, and by the solemne tearmes of a league, which is the ground of all the
pernitious actions proceeding from those sorts of people, who are, haue beene, and shall be
practioners in that cursed and hellish Art. And yet no more then she, that Witch of whom in
this relation we do speake, hath of her owne accord, and voluntarily acknowledged after conference
had with me, and sundry learned and reuerend Diuines, who both prayed for her conuersion, carefully
instructed her in the way to saluation, and hopefully rescued her from the Diuell, (to whom
she was deuoted, and by him seduced) and regained her to God, from whom she was departed by
Apostacie. And in this so Christian and holy action were the continuall paines of

            { Thomas Howes.
            { Thomas Hares.
    Maister { Iohn Man.
            { William Leedes.
            { Robert Burward.
            { William Armitage.

And of these in the day of execution (which she in no wise would condiscend vnto should be
deferred, though offered repriuall vpon hope that more might haue beene acknowledged) being
very distemperate, neuerthelesse some accompanied her to the place, and were both eye and eare-witnesses
of her behauiour there, seeing and hearing how she did then particularly confesse her confederacy
with the Diuell, cursing, banning, and enuy towards her neighbours, and hurts done to then,
expressing euery one by name, so many as be in the following discourse, nominated, and how
she craued mercy of God, and pardon for her offences, with other more specialties afterward
expressed. And thus I end, taking my leaue, and commending thee to the gracious guidance and
preseruation of our good God in our blessed Sauiour Christ Iesus.

            Thine euer in the Lord,

                   A TREATISE OF THE
                    CONFESSION AND
               EXECVTION OF MARY SMITH,
               CONVICTED OF WITCHCRAFT,
  and condemned for the same: of her contract vocally
       & in solemne tearmes made with the Diuell;
      by whose meanes she hurt sundry persons whom
   she enuied, with some necessary Propositions added
 thereunto, discouering the wickednesse of that damnable
       Art, and diuers other speciall poynts, not
        impertinent vnto the same, such as ought
            diligently of euery Christian to
                    bee considered.

There is some diuersitie of iudgement among the learned, who should be the first Author and
Inuenter of Magicall and curious Arts. The most generall occurrence of opinion is, that they
fetch their pedigree from the [a]Persians, who searching more deeply into the secrets of Nature
then others, and not contented to bound themselues within the limits thereof, fell foule of
the Diuell, and were insnared in his nets.

    [Footnote a: Augustinus de diuinatione Dæmonum: & de Ciuitate
    Dei. lib. 7. cap. 35. Plinius historia naturalis lib. 30. cap. 1.]

And among these, the publisher vnto the world was Zoroaster, who so soone as he by birth[b]
entred the world, contrary to the vsuall condition of other men, laughed (whereas the beginning
of our life is a sob, the end a sigh) and this was ominous to himselfe, no warrantise for the
enioying of the pleasures of this life, ouercome in battell by Ninus[c] King of the Assirians,
and ending his dayes by the stroake of a thunder-bolt, and could not, though a famous Sorcerer,
either fore-see, or preuent his owne destinie. And because he writ many bookes of this damnable
Art, and left them to posterity, may well be accounted a chiefe maister of the same. But the
Diuell[d] must haue the precedencie, whose schollers both he and the rest were, who followed
treading in his steps. For he taught them South-saying, Auguration, Necromancie, and the rest,
meere delusions, aiming therein at no other marke, then to with draw men from the true worshipping
of God. And all these pernitious practises are fast tied together by the tailes, though their
faces looke sundry wayes; and therefore the Professors thereof are stiled by sundry names,
as Magitians, Necromancers, Inchanters, Wisards, Hagges, Fortune-tellers, Diuiners, Witches,
Cunning Men, and Women, &c. Whose Art is such a hidden mystery of[e] wickednesse, and so vnsearchable
a depth of Sathan, that neither the secrets of the one can be discouered, nor the bottome of
the other further sounded, then either the practisers thereof themselues by their owne voluntary
confessions made, or procured by order of Iustice (according to the manner of that Countrey
where they be questioned) haue acknowledged, or is manifested by the sundry mischiefes done
of them vnto others, proued by impartiall testimonies vpon oath, and by vehement presumptions
confirmed, or else communicated vnto vs in the learned Treatises, and discourses of ancient
and late Writers gathered from the same grounds. And[f] although this Hellish Art be not now
so frequent as heretofore, since the Pagans haue beene conuerted vnto Christianity, and the
thick fogges of Popery ouer-mantling the bright shining beames of the Gospel of Iesus Christ
(who came to dissolue the workes of the Diuell .1. Ioh. 3. 8.) and were by the sincere and
powerfull preaching therof dispersed; yet considering these bee the last times, dayes euill
& dangerous, fore-told that should come, 2. Tim. 3. 1. in which iniquity must abound, Mat.
24. 12. and as a raging deluge ouer-runne all, so that Faith shall scarce be found vpon earth,
Luk. 18. 8. and the Diuell loosed from his thousand yeares imprisonment, [g]Reuel. 20. 3. enraged
with great wrath walketh about, and seeketh whom he may deuoure .1. Pet. 5. 8. Because he knoweth
hee hath but a short time, Reu. 12. 12. Before I enter into the particularity of the narration
intended, it shall be materiall to set downe some generall propositions, as a handfull of gleanings
gathered in the plentifull haruest of such learned men, who haue written of this argument,
whereby the erronious may be recalled, the weake strengthened, the ignorant informed, and such
as iudge aright already, confirmed: and among many other these as chiefe, all which you shall
see exemplified in the following Discourse.

    The first Proposition.

It is a Quære, though needlesse, whether there be any Witches: for they[a] haue some Proctors
who plead a nullitie in this case, perswade themselues, and would induce others to be of the
same minde, that there be no Witches at all: but a sort of melancholique, aged, and ignorant
Women, deluded in their imagination; and acknowledge such things to be effected by them, which
are vnpossible, vnlikely, and they neuer did; and therefore Magistrates who inflict any punishment
vpon them, be vnmercifull and cruell Butchers. Yet by the way, and their good leaue, who take
vpon them this Apology, all who are conuented vpon these vnlawfull action, are not strucken
in yeares; but some euen in the flower of their youth be nuzled vp in the same, and convicted
to be practisers thereof; neither be they ouerflowed with a blacke melancholique humor, dazeling
the phantasie, but haue their vnderstandings cleere, and wits as quicke as other: Neither yet
be they all women, though for the most part that sexe be inclinable thereunto: (as shall afterward
be shewed, and the causes thereof) but men also on whose behalfe no exception can be laid,
why any should demurre either of their offence or punishment for the same. Wherefore for this
point, and confirmation of the affirmatiue, wee haue sundry pregnant and euident proofes.

    [Footnote a: Wierus de magor[~u] infamium p[oe]nis lib 6. cap.
    17.18 19 20 21 22 23 24 &. 27. & de Lamijs lib 3. cap 7. & de
    lamiarum impotentia. But this position commeth from another as
    dangerous, euen Infidelity denying that there be any Diuel, but
    in opinion; which was the doctrine of Aristotle, and the
    Peripatetique Philpsophers. Pomponatius de incarnationibus
    Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum]

First testimonies Diuine and Humane: Diuine of God himselfe in his word,[b] left for our instruction
in all dogmaticall truth, reproofe and confutation of falshood in opinions, correction for
the reforming of misdemeaners in conuersation, doctrine for the guidance of euery estate Politicall,
Ecclesiasticall, Oeconomicall. 2. Timoth. 3. 16. Therefore expressely, Thou shalt not suffer
a Witch, to liue, Exod. 22. 18.[c] but to bee executed in the same day wherein she is conuicted,
and this was a custome obserued by the ancient Fathers. And Deuteronomy 18. 10.11. there is
a blacke Bill set downe[d], and registred of sundry kinds of these slaues of Sathan, all condemned,
and God addeth in the same place the reasons of this his seuere and sharpe iudgement against
them. First, because they are an abhomination vnto him. Secondly, he determineth vtterly to
destroy all such, and giueth his people the Israelites an example thereof in the Canaanites,
whom their Land spewed out. Thirdly, for that he requireth all who belong vnto him, to be pure,
vndefiled and holy, not stained with impieties, for they are bound vnto him by couenant in
obedience. Fourthly such were the Heathen, strangers from God, blinded in their dark vnderstanding,
without sauing knowledge, with whom the Israelites, a chosen and peculiar nation, enioying
his lawes and statutes, must haue no familiarity. Further, the woman of Endor acknowledgeth
herselfe to be one of the rank. 1. Sam. 28. 9. And Iesabel, mother of Iehoram, is in plaine
tearmes stiled a Witch. 2. King. 9. 22. who is [e]supposed to haue brought this Art, and the
Professors thereof into Samaria, which there continued for the space of sixe hundred yeares.
Insomuch that it was rife in common speech, when any would reproach another, to doe the same
in this forme; Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a Diuell (a familiar spirit) which the malicious
Iewes, not abiding his heauenly and gracious doctrine, obiected to Christ Iesus our blessed
Sauiour, Ioh. 8. 48. The holy Apostle reprouing the Galathians for their sudden Apostasie and
back-sliding from the Gospell so powerfully preached vnto them and with so great euidence of
the spirit, as though Christ had bin crucified before their eyes, doth it in no other termes
than these, Who hath bewitched you? Gal. 3. 1. And afterward, Cap. 5. 20. marshalleth Witch-craft
among the workes of the flesh: In both which places the names are taken from the seducements
and illusions of Inchanters, who astonish the mindes, and deceiue the senses of men, and all
that by vertue of a contract passed betwene them and the Diuell. Other like proofes may be
added to these alledged, Leuit. 20. 6. Micah 5. 12. Nahum 3. 4. Now then when God affirmeth
there be such, whose words are truth, shall man dare once to open his mouth, and contradict
the most righteous?

Concerning humane witnesses, they be almost infinite; and therefore it shall be sufficient
to produce some few, choyce, and selected: [f] The second Councell of Constantinople held and
gathered together in the Imperiall palace, of two hundred seuen and twenty learned and reuerent
Bishops, nameth sundry sorts of such Sorcerers, and censureth their actions to be the damned
practises of the Pagans, and decreeth all the Agents therein excommunicated from the Church
and society of Christian people, adding the motiue reason of this their determined sentence,
from the Apostle, 2. Cor. 6. 14. For righteousnesse hath no fellowship with vnrighteousnesse,
neither is there communion of light with darknesse, nor concord with Christ and Belial, nor
the beleeuer can haue part with an Infidell. And [g]Chrysostome sharply reproueth all such,
and those who aduise with them vpon any occasion, confuting the reasons which they take to
be sufficient warantise of their doings. As among the rest they will pretend, Shee was a Christian
woman who doth thus charme or inchant; and taketh no other but the name of God in her mouth,
vseth the words of sacred Scripture. To this that holy Father replieth, Therefore she is the
more to be hated, because shee hath abused and taken in vaine that great and glorious name,
and professing herselfe a Christian, yet practiseth the [h]damnable Arts of miscreant and vnbeleeuing
Heathen. For the Diuels could speake the name of God, and neuerthelesse were still Diuels;
and when they said vnto Christ, they knew who he was, the holy one of God, &c. Mar. 1. 24.25.
their mouthes were stopped, he would no such witnesse, that wee should learne, not to beleeue
them when they say the truth: for this is but a bait, that wee might afterward follow their
lies. There is much mention made of these, both in the Ciuill and [i]Canon Lawes, and diuersitie
of punishment alotted out for them; so that none can doubt but that there hath beene, and are
such. I might remember vnto you the authority of Clemens Romanus in his Recognitions, and those
Constitutions which are fathered vpon the Apostles; but their credit is not so great, that
they may without exception be impannelled vpon this Iury, for they haue long since been chalenged
of [k]insufficiencie.

Among the Gentiles, when these so qualitied persons did swarme, and were accounted of high
esteeme, there be reckoned vp whole troopes of this blacke guard of the Diuell; As [l]Circe
whom Homer reporteth to haue turned Vlysses Companions into Wolues, Lyons, Swine, &c. by her
Inchantments, insauaging and making them beast-like and furious. Medea[m] famous in this kinde,
for she murthered by Witch-craft Glauca in the day of her marriage, who enioyed Iason her loue.
And[n] the Mortars of these two, wherein they stamped their Magicall drugges, were for a long
time kept in a certaine mountaine, and shewed as strange monuments to those who desired a sight
of them. For[o] the Diuel furnisheth such with powders, oyntments, hearbes, and like receipts,
whereby they procure sicknesse, death, health, or worke other supernaturall effects. Of the
same profession were [p]Simotha, [q]Erictho, [r]Canidia, and infinite others beside, whose
damnable memory deserueth to be buried in euerlasting obliuion.

But because the reports of these may seeme to carry small credit, for that they come from Poets,
who are stained with the note of licentious [s]faining, and so put off as vaine fictions; yet
seeing they deliuer nothing herein but that which was well knowne and vsuall in those times

they affirme no more then is manifest in the records of most approued Histories, whose essence

to insist vpon particulars, there bee infinite numbers ouerflowing euen in these our[cc] dayes,
since the sinceritie of Christian Profession hath decreased, and beene in a sort ecclipsed
in the hearts of men: for the period of the continuance thereof (after it be once imbraced)
in his first integrity, either for zeale of affection, or strictnesse of discipline, hath beene
by some learned Diuines[dd] obserued, to bee confined within the compass of twenty yeares;
and then afterward by degrees, the one waxed cold, and the other dissolute: which being so,
it is not to be maruelled though the Diuell now begin to shew himselfe in these his instruments,
as heretofore, though he cannot in the same measure, in respect of those sparkes of light which
yet shine amongst vs. But of this so much now, because I shall haue afterward occasion further
to enlarge this poynt.

Againe, the policie of all States[ee] haue prouided for the rooting out of these poysonfull
Weedes, and cutting of these rotten and infected members; and therefore infallibly prouing
their existence and being: for all[ff] penall lawes looke to matters of fact and are made to
punish for the present, and preuent in future, some wicked actions already committed. And therefore
Solon the Athenian making statutes for the setling of that Common-wealth, when a defect was
found, that he omitted to prouide a cautelous restraint, and appoint[gg] answerable punishm[~e]t
for such who had killed their parents, answered, He neuer suspected there were or would be
any such. Wherefore to confirme the position set downe, God doth not threaten to cast away
his people for murther, incest, tyranny, &c. But Sorcery, Leuit. 20. 6. And Samuel willing
to shew Saul the grieuousnesse of his disobedience, compareth it to witch-craft, 1. Sam. 15.
23. The Holy Ghost also manifesting how highly God was displeased with Manasses, maketh this
the reason, because hee gaue himselfe to Witch-craft, and to Charming, and to Sorcery, and
vsed them who had familiar spirits, and did much euill in the sight of the Lord to anger him,

from nature: [kk]and Iulius Paulus distinguishing the punishment according to the different

Gunthrunus and Canutus will haue them, being once apprehended (that the rest of the people
might bee pure and vndefiled) sent into banishment, or if they abide in the kingdome (continuing
their lewd practises) executed according to desert. So Athelstane, if they be conuicted to
haue killed any, &c. And how the present estate standeth affected toward them, the sundry strict

    The second Proposition.

The second Proposition: [a]Who those be, and of what quality, that are thus ensnared of the
Diuell, and vndermined by his fraudes. For resolution whereof, this may suffice. Those who
either maliciously reiect the Gospell offered vnto them: or receiuing and vnderstanding the
same, do but coldly respect, and carelessly taste it, without making any due estimation, or
hauing any reuerent regard therof. In both which is a manifest and open contempt of God. For
as he purposing to honour the first comming of his Sonne into the World, cloathed in the cloud
of our flesh, which he assumed then, suffered many to be really possessed of Diuels, to bee
lunatique, deafe, dumbe, blinde, &c. whom he might deliuer from these torments, and so make
apparant his glory, and shew by these his miracles wrought, that hee was the promised Messias,
Esay 35. 5.6. And therfore Christ referreth those Disciples whom Iohn sent vnto him (doubting
in respect of that base forme which he tooke, and demanding whether it was he that should come,
or another to be looked for) vnto his Doctrine and Workes; and by them to bee instructed, whereof
they were then both hearers and beholders, Math. 11. 3.4.5. So now comming in the dew of his
grace, and hauing restored the light of the Gospell, and bestowed that vpon mankinde, as an
especiall and vnvaluable blessing, in his iustice giueth ouer the despisers thereof vnto the
power of Sathan, whereby both others who contemne the same, might by their dreadfull example
bee terrified, and the faithfull stirred vp to a respectiue thankfulnesse, for so great a mercy
vouchsafed vnto them, and acknowledge their happinesse in being made partakers thereof, and
by especiall fauour deliuered out of the tyranny of the Diuell: For this is one of the fearefull
iudgements of God, and hidden from vs (as all are a great depth, Psal. 36. 6.) that those who
receiued not the truth that they might be saued, should haue strong delusions sent vnto them,
and bee giuen ouer to belieue Sathan and his lying signes, and false wonders, 2. Thess. 2.
10. And thus consenting vnto sinne, and his suggestions, they are depriued of the [b]helpe
and assistance of God, and so disabled to resist all violent rushing temptations: for one offence,
not being truely repented of, bringeth another, and at last throweth head-long downe into hell:
and by this meanes man despising God his creator & redeemer, and obeying the Diuell a professed
enemy, and irreconciliable aduersary, not easie to be confronted, becommeth his seruant: for
of whomsoeuer any is ouercome, euen of the same is hee brought into bondage, 2. Pet. 2. 19.
And the Apostle giueth as the reason why the heathen were so sottish Idolaters, and defiled
themselues with many detestable and loathsome sinnes, [c]because when they knew God, they glorified
him not as God, neither were thankfull, therefore God gaue them ouer to a reprobate sence,
and vile affections to doe those things which were not conuenient, full of all vnrighteousnesse,
Rom 1. 24.25. &. 29 So these being enthralled, and deuoting themselues to the Diuell by a mutuall
league (either expresse or secret) he brandeth with his mark for his [d]owne, as in ancient
time was an vse with Bondslaues and [e]Captiues, and these bee +ezôgrêmenoi+, taken aliue in
his snare, 2. Tim. 2. 26. and that in some part of the body, least either suspected or perceiued
by vs (for hee is a cunning concealer) as vnder the eye-lids, or in the palat of the mouth,
or other secret places: Wherefore some Iudges cause them, once being called into question,
and accused, to be shauen all the body[f] ouer. And for the manner of impression, or branding,
it is after this sort. The Diuell when hee hath once made the contract betweene himselfe and
the Witch, and agreed vpon the conditions, what they shall doe, the one for the other, giueth
her some scratch[g], which remaineth ful of paine & anguish vntill his return againe: at which
time hee doth so benumme the same, that though it be pierced with any sharpe instrument, yet
is without any sence of feeling, and will not yeeld one droppe of bloud at all: a matter knowne
by iust, often, and due triall.

And for the most part, hee bringeth these his slaues and vassailes obliged to him as his owne,
to some desperate, Tragicall,[h] and disastrous end; and that either by the execution of Iustice
for their demerits, or by laying violent hands vpon themselues, or else God powreth vpon them
some strange and extraordinary vengeance, or their Grand-maister whom they haue serued, dispatcheth
them in such manner, as they become dreadfull and terrible spectacles to the beholders, whereof
Histories will furnish vs with [i]varietie and plenty of examples: For the Diuell is a murthering
spirit, desirous to doe mischiefe, swelling in pride, malitious in hatred, spitefull in enuy,
subtill in craft; and therefore it behoueth euery one resolutely to withstand his assaults,
Ephes. 4. 27. and cautelously to decline his subtilties, and cunning ambushments [Sidenote:
+methodeiai+] from whence he inuadeth vs, Eph. 6. 11.[k] For this aduersary against whom we
fight, is an old beaten enemy, sixe thousand yeares are fully compleat since the first time
hee began to assault mankinde. But if any keepe the Commandements of God, and constantly, by
a liuely faith, cleaue fast vnto Christ, he shall ouercome: for our Lord is inuincible.[l]
The Diuels indeed doe willingly offer themselues to be seene of those who are not gouerned
by the Holy Ghost; and that either to win themselues some estimation, or to intangle and deceiue
men, vailing their treacheries vnder a smiling countenance, whom they deadly hate, for if it
lay in their possibilitie, they would ouerthrow and destroy heauen it selfe. Now vnable to
do this, they endeuour to worke vpon a more weake subiect and matter; and therefore hee that
will not bee subdued of them, must auoid all occasions whereby he may take any aduantage, and
couered with the Breast-plate of Righteousnesse, and defended with the Shield of Faith, quench
all his fiery Darts. Ephes. 6. 14.

    The third Proposition.

Except God do by his especial grace and ouerruling power, restraine the malice of these Witches
and preserue his Children, they are permissiuely able,[a] through the helpe of the Diuell their
maister, to hurt Men and Beasts, and trouble the elements, by vertue of that contract & agreement
which they haue made with him. For man they endamage both in body & mind: In body, for [b]Daneus
reporteth of his owne knowledge, as an eye-witnesse thereof, that he hath seene the breasts
of Nurces (onely touched by their hands) those sacred fountaines of humane nourishment so dried
vp that they could yeeld no milke; some suddenly tormented with extreame and intolerable paine
of the Cholicke, others[c] oppressed with the Palsie, Leprosie, Gout, Apoplexie, &c. And thus
disabled from the performance of any action, many tortured with lingring consumptions,[d] and
not a few afflicted with such diseases, which neither they themselues who wrought that euill,
could afterward helpe; nor be cured thereof by the Art and diligent attendance of most skilfull
Physitians. I willingly let passe other mischiefes wrought by them, of which many things are
deliuered in the Canon and Ciuill Lawes, in the Schoole-men, and Diuines both ancient and moderne.

In minde, stirring vp men to lust, to hatred, to loue, and the like[e] passions, and that by
altering the inward and outward sences, either in forming some new obiect, or offering the
same to the eye or eare, or stirring the humors: for there being a neere coniunction betweene
the sensitiue and rationall faculties of the soule, if the one bee affected, the other (though
indirectly) must of necessity be also moued. As for example, when they would prouoke any to
loue or hatred, they propound an obiect vnder the shew and appearance of that which is good
and beautifull, so that it may be desired and embraced: or else by representation of that which
is euill & infamous, procure dislike and detestation. Neither is this any strange position,
or improbable, but may bee warranted by sufficient authority; and therefore [f]Constantius
the Emperour doth expressely determine, all those iustly punishable who sollicite by enchantments
chaste mindes to vncleannesse: And Saint [g]Ierome attributeth vnto them this power, that they
can enforce men to hate those things they should loue, and affect that which they ought to
auoyd: and the ground hereof hath his strength from the holy Scriptures: for the Diuell is
able to enflame wanton[h] lust in the heart, and therfore is named, the Spirit of Fornication,

There is a very remarkeable example mentioned by Ierome[i], of a maiden in Gaza whom a yong
man louing, and not obtaining, went to Memphis in Egypt, and at the yeares end in his returne,
being there instructed by a Priest of Aesculapius, and furnished with Magicall Coniurations,
graued in a plate of brasse, strange charming words, and pictures which he buried vnder the
threshold of the doore where the virgin dwelt: by which meanes she fell into a fury, pulled
off the attire of her head, flung about her haire, gnashed with her teeth, and continually
called vpon the name of her louer.

The like doth [k]Nazianzene report of Cyprian before his conuersion (though some thinke it
[l]was not he whose learned and religions writings are extant, and for the profession of his
faith and doctrine was crowned with Martyrdome) but another of that name, toward Iustina, whom
hee lasciuiously[m] courted, and vnlawfully lusted after. It were easie for me to instance
this in many, and to adde more testimonies, but my intended purpose was, to set downe onely
some few propositions, whereby the iudicious reader might be stirred vp to a deeper search,
and further consideration of these things: for often they driue men to a madnesse, and other
such desperate passions, that they become murtherers of themselues. But this alwayes must be
kept in minde, as a granted and infallible truth, [n]That whatsoeuer the Witch doth, it receiueth
his force from that society which she hath with the Diuell, who serueth her turne in effecting
what she purposeth, and so they worke together as [o]associates.

For [p]the Elements, it is an agreeing consent of all, that they can corrupt and infect them,
procure tempests, to stirre vp thunder & lightning, moue violent winds, destroy the fruits

It were but fruitlesse labour, and ill spent, to bestow long time in confirming this so manifest
a truth, and not much better then set vp a candle to giue the Sunnelight when it shineth brightest
in mid-heauen: yet to satisfie those who doubt here-of, I will giue a small touch of an example
or two.

[q]Curius Sidius the Roman Generall in a battell against Salebus, Captaine of the Moores, in
want of water, obtained such abundance of raine from Heauen by Magicall inchantments, that
it not onely sufficed the thirst of his distressed Souldiers, but terrified the enemies in
such sort, (supposing that God had sent helpe) as of their owne accord, they sought for conditions
of peace, and left the field.

    [Footnote q: Dion. Cassius Romana Historiæ, lib. 60. in Claudio.]

The narration of Olaus[r] Magnus which he maketh of his Northerne Wisards and Witches, would
seeme to be meere fictions, and altogether incredible, as of Ericus, who had the winde at command,
to blow alwayes from that quarter to which he would set his hat. Or Hagbert, who could shew
herselfe in any shape, higher or lower, as she pleased, at one time so great as a Giant, at
another as little as a Dwarfe: by whose Diabolicall practises mighty Armies haue beene dicomfited,
and sundry others, except the truth hereof were without contradiction approued: by the experience
of our owne Nauigators, who trade in Finland, Denmarke, Lapland, Ward-house, Norway, and other
Countries of that Climate, and haue obtained of the inhabitants thereof, a certaine winde for
twenty dayes together, or the like fixed period of time, according to the distance of place
and strings tied with three knots, so that if one were loosed, they should haue a pleasant
gale: if the second, a more vehement blast: if the third, such hideous & raging tempests that
the Mariners were not able once to looke out, to stand vpon the hatches, to handle their tackle,
or to guide the helme with all their strength; and are somtimes violently carried back to the
place from whence they first loosed to sea; and many (more hardy then wise) haue bought their
triall full deere, opening those knots, and neglecting admonition giuen to the contrary. Apuleius
ascribeth to Pamphile, a Witch of Thessalia, little lesse then diuine power to effect strange
wonders in heauen, in earth, in hell; to darken the starres, stay the course of riuers, dissolue
mountains, and raise vp spirits, this opinion went for currant and vncontrouled. And without
all question the Diuell[s] can do this and much more, when God letteth him loose. For he is
stiled, The Prince of the world, Ioh. 12. 31. A strong man armed, Luke 11. 21, Principality,
a ruler of darknesse, spirituall wickednesse in high places, Ephes. 6. 12.

Thus he dismaied the heart of Saul (when he had broken the Commandement of God) with dreadfull
feare, and enraged his minde with bloudy fury, 1. Sam. 16. 14. Entred into Iudas, prouoked
him to betray his maister, dispaire and hang himselfe, Math. 27. 3. filled the heart of Ananias
and Saphira with dissimulation,Act. 5. 3. possessed the bodies of many really, as is manifest
in the History of the Gospell. Our Sauiour Christ assureth vs, that a daughter of Abraham was
bound for 18 yeares by Sathan, with such a spirit of infirmitie, as bowed together, shee could
in no wise lift vp herselfe, Luk. 13. 11.16. He spake out of the Pythonesse, Act. 16. 17. brought
downe fire from heauen, and consumed Iobs sheepe 7000. and his seruants, raised a storme, strooke
the house wherein his sonnes and daughters feasted with their elder brother, smote the foure
corners of it, with the ruine whereof they all were destroyed, and perished: and ouerspread
the body of that holy Saint their father with botches[t] and biles from the sole of his foot
to the crowne of his head.[u] And hee wil haue his seruants Wisards & Witches, coadiutors with
him, and maketh them fit instruments to the performance of all wicked exploits, and this is
when God pleaseth (of which I shall haue occasion to speake more afterward) to giue leaue,
for his wil is the first supreme and principal cause of all things: and nothing can be done
visibly in this Common-wealth here below of the creatures, but is decreed and determined so
to be first in the high Court of Heauen, according to his vnsearchable wisedome and iustice,
disposing punishments and rewards as seemeth good vnto himselfe. So Pharaohs[x] Magitians could
turne water into bloud, their roddes into serpents, produce frogges, &c. But when it came to
the base vermine, to make lice, they were pusled, and acknowledged their imbecillity, confessing,
Digitus Dei est,[u] Gods finger is here, Exod. 18. 19. For if they could effect and bring to
passe all mischieuous designements without his sufferance, it would inferre a weakenesse, and
conclude a defect of[z] power in him, as not sufficient to oppose their strength, supplant
their force, and auoid their stratagems. And we must not imagine that the practioners of these
damnable Arts of which sexe soeuer, be they men or women, do performe those mischifes which
they effect, by their owne skills or such meanes as they vse, of which sort bee the bones of
dead mens skuls, Toades, Characters, Images, &c. But through the cooperation of the Diuell,
who is by nature subtile, by long experience instructed, swift to produceth strange works,
& to humane vnderstanding admirable. Yet[aa] he will haue those his vassals perswaded of some
great benefit bestowed vpon them, whereby they are inabled to helpe and hurt, whom, how, and
when they list; and all to indeere them, & by making them partakers in his villany, being strongly
bound in his seruice, & stedfastly continued in the same, might more grieuously offend God,
and bring iust condemnation vpon themselues. And for the greater, and more forceable inticing
allurement hereunto, hee promiseth to giue and doe many things for their sakes, and reueale
to them hidden secrets, and future euents, such[bb] as he himselfe purposeth to doe, or knoweth
by naturall signes shall come to passe. So then to conclude, in[cc] euery Magicall action,
there must be a concurrence of these three. First, the permitting will of God. Secondly, the
suggestion of the Diuell, and his power cooperating. Thirdly, the desire and consent of the
Sorcerer; and if[dd] any of these be wanting, no trick of witch-craft can be performed. For
if God did not suffer it, neither the Diuell, nor the Witch could preuaile to do any thing,
no not so much as to hurt one[ee] bristle of a Swine. And if the Diuell had not seduced the
minde of the wicked woman, no such matter would haue beene attempted. And againe, if hee had
not the Witch to bee his instrument, the Diuell were debarred of his purpose.

And as these euill spirits are in themselues different in power, vnderstanding, and subtiltie:
so can their seruants do more or lesse through their meanes.

I conclude with that memorable speech of a most noble and learned man,[ff] The Diuell is the
Author and principall of all that euill which the Witch or Wisard committeth, not thereby to
make them more powerfull, but to deceiue them by credulity and ouer-light beliefe, and to get
himselfe a companion of his impiety, cruelty, and hatred, which he beareth both to God and
man; and also of eternall damnation: for indeed it is his worke, which the foolish and doating
wisards coniecture is brought to passe by the words and inchantments which they vtter: and
is very busie thus to colour his proceedings, which neuer come abroad in their owne likenesse,
because he enuieth the blessed estate of man, and his eternall saluation purchased by the perfect
obedience of Christ the Redeemer, and hateth that Image of God which hee beholdeth in him;
much like the Panther,[gg] who when hee cannot get hold of the man himselfe, is so inflamed
with rage, that he teareth his picture in peeces violently which is cast vpon the ground to
hinder his pursuit of the hunter who hath carried away his whelpes. And [hh]so as Lactantius
speaketh, these vncleane spirits cast from heauen, wander vp and downe the earth, compasse
land and sea, seeking to bring men to destruction as a consort of their owne desperate and
irrecouerable estate.

    The fourth Proposition.

Hauing shewed before, that the pracise of Witches receiueth the being and perfection from that[a]
agreement which is made betweene them and Diuell, it now followeth necessarily, that we do
enquire whether it bee possible that there may be any such agreement and league betweene them.
The cause of doubt ariseth from the diuersity or disparity of their natures, the one being
a corporall substance, the other spirituall, vpon which ground some[b] haue supposed that no
such contract can passe: But we are to hold the contrary affirmatiue, both de esse, and de
posse, that there may be, and is, notwithstanding this difference of essence, a mutuall contract
of the one with the other: for we read of sundry leagues between God & his people, and some
with great solemnitie of ceremonies vsed in the same, a[c] Genesis 15. 9.17. and Deut. 5. 2.
and in many other like places, yet is hee a simple essence,[d] free from all diuision, multiplication,
composition, accidents, incorporeall, spirituall, and inuisible. But in Angelicall creatures,
though there be no Physicall composition of matter and forme, or a soule and a body; yet is
there a metaphysicall, being substances consisting of an act and possibility, subiect and accidents.
And furthcr, betweene a spirit and a man, there is communication of the vnderstanding and will,
the faculties and actions whereof must concurre in euery couenant, which is nothing else but
the consent of two or more persons about the thing.

    Augustinus.]

    [Footnote d: Palanus Syntagmatis Theologie, l. 2. cap. 8.]

And when the Diuell durst in expresse tearmes tender a contract to our blessed Sauiour, tempting
him in the wildernesse, shewing him the kingdomes of the world, and the glory thereof, offered
them with this condition, All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me,
Mat. 4. 9. How much more then will hee aduenture vpon man, weake, wicked, and easie to be seduced?
And who[e] can doubt but that these bee the solemne and formall words of a bargaine, Do vt
des, do vt facias, I giue this for to haue that giuen, I bestow this, to haue such, or such
a thing done for me.

    [Footnote e: Brissonius de formulis, lib. 6. Solemnia pactorum
    sine obligatione verba sunt: spondes? spondeo. promittis? promitto
    dabis? dabo vt facias, faciam. Iustinianus in institutionibus,
    lib. 3. titulo 16.]

Now this couenant is of two sorts, secret or manifest; secret, when one indeuoureth or intendeth
to do any thing by such meanes, which neither in nature, nor by institution haue power to produce
the purposed effects, or be conioyned as neccessary with other, which can bring the same to
passe. Expresse, wherein consent is giuen either by writing, and words, or making such signes,
whereby they renounce God, and deuote themselues slaues and vassals vnto the Diuell, hee promising,
that vpon such condition they shall doe wonders, know future euents, helpe and hurt at their
pleasure, and others like vnto these.

An example whereof wee may obserue in[f] Siluester the second, one of the holy Fathers of Rome,
who did homage to the Diuell his Lord, and made fidelity to liue at his will and appoyntment,
vpon condition to obtaine what he desired, by which meanes he got first the Bishopricke of
Rhemes, after of Rauenna, and at the last the Papacie of Rome. Which Sea, though it will yeeld
good plenty of such like presidents, and we may finde them in authenticall records of Histories,
yet I content my selfe with this one.

    Barnes. de vitis pontificum Romanorum.]

[g]The formall tearmes of this couenant, as they bee set downe by some, are most dreadfull:
and the seuerall poynts these.

    [Footnote g: Godelmannus de magia tacita & illicita, lib. 1. cap.
    2. xº.8.9.10 &c.]

To renounce God his Creator, and that promise made in Baptisme.

To deny Iesus Christ, and refuse the benefites of his obedience, yea to blaspheme his glorious
and holy name.

To worship the Deuill, & repose all confidence and trust in him.

To execute his commaundements.

To vse things created of God for no end, but to the hurt and destruction of others.

And lastly, to giue himselfe soule and body to that deceitfull and infernall spirit, who on
the other part appeareth to them in the shape of a man (which is most common) or some other
creature, conferreth familiarly, and bindeth himselfe by many promises, that at all times called
for, he will presently come, giue counsell, further their desires, answer any demaund, deliuer
from prison, and out of all dangers, bestow riches, wealth, pleasure, and what not? and all
without any labour and paines-taking, in a word to become seruiceable to their will, & accomplish
all their requests. And this is that which the Prophet Esay speaketh, chap. 28. 15. to make
a couenant with death, and an agreement with hell. The consent of the ancient Fathers, if there
were any doubt, might be added to the further clearing of this conclusion. For [h]Cyprian directly
affirmeth, that all those who vse magicall Arts, make a couenant with the Diuell, yea he himselfe,
while he practized the same (before his calling to the light and true knowledge of God) was
bound vnto him by an especiall[i] writing, whereunto some subscribe with their owne bloud,
which was a vse among diuers nations, and a most sure bond of constant friendship, and [k]inuiolable
consociation. But herein these seduced wretches are deceiued: for these promises which he makes,
are treacherous, and the obseruances whereunto he enioyneth and perswadeth them, as powerfull
in producing such or such effects, meere deceipts, and haue no qualitie in them to that purpose,
but respecteth his owne ends, which are one of these foure.

First, to the mouing of them to the breaking of Gods law.

Secondly, to adore him with diuine worship and sacred rites.

Thirdly, to weaken their hope and faith in God.

Fourthly, to couer his owne fraud and treachery, that it may not be perceiued.

And when they finde this Impostor failing in the performance of his vowed promises, then he
wanteth not his shifts: as that these defects are not to be imputed to him, or the weakenesse
of the Art, but their owne negligence or ignorance, who haue not exactly obserued such directions,
and in that manner they were deliuered: or mistooke his meaning, which is commonly deliuered
in[l] ambiguous tearmes, such as will admit a double construction: and herein appeareth the
lamentable and woefull blindnesse of man, who is contented to swallow vp, and excuse many of
his lies by one truth fore-told; which hath casually come to passe, whereas in other matters
they make light account of, yea cõtemne infinit truths, if they shall finde by long search
and diligent inquiry, but one falshood. Wherefore it behooueth vs to be carefull Centinels
ouer our selues, for that our grand[m] aduersary, proud, enuious, and not standing in the truth,
reposeth all his possibility of victory in lies, and out of this poysoned sinke, deuiseth all
kinde of deceits, that so hee might depriue man of that happy and blessed estate which he lost
by pride, and draw him into the society of his owne damnation: therefore it is a needfull caueat
giuen by one of the ancient Fathers: Our enemy is old against whom wee fight, sixe [n]thousand
yeares fully compleat are passed since he began to oppose himself against vs; but if wee obserue
the commandements of God, and continue steadfast in faith, apprehending Iesus Christ, then
shall we be able to withstand all his violent assaults, and ouer-come him because Christ in
whom we trust, is inuincible.

    [Footnote l: As that to Pope Siluester the second, his demand;
    who asked how long he should liue and enioy the Popedome?
    answered, vntil hee should say masse in Ierusalem; and not long
    after, celebrating the same in a Chappell of the Church
    dedicated to the holy Crosse in Rome, called Ierusalem, knew
    how he was ouer-reached, for there hee dyed. And an other paralell
    to this, may be that of a certaine Bishop, much addicted to these
    vanities, hauing many enemies, and fearing them, asked the Diuell
    whether he should fly or not: who answered, Non, sta secure,
    venient inimici tui suauiter, & subdentur tibi. But being
    surprized, and taken by his aduersaries, and his castle set on
    fire, expostulating with him that hee had deceiued him in his
    distresse, returned answere, that he said true, if his speech had
    been rightly vnderstood: for he aduised, Non sta secure [id est
    fugias] venient inimici tui suauiter, & subdentur, [id est
    ignem tibi]. Such were the Oracles which he gaue, and whereof
    all histories do testifie. Holcot vpon the booke of Wisedome,

    The fifth Proposition.

The Diuell can assume to himself[a] a body, and frame a voyce to speake with, and further instruct
and giue satisfaction to those who haue submitted themselues vnto him, and are bound to his
seruice. For he lost not by his transgression and fall, his naturall[b] endowments, but they
continued in him whole[c] and perfect, as in the good Angels, who abide in that obedience and
holiness wherein they were created, from whence a reason confirmatiue may bee thus framed,
Good Angels can take vnto themselues bodies, as Genes. 18. 2. Iudg. 13. 3.6. therefore the
euill also. Thus the Diuell hath appeared to some in the forme of a [d]Man, cloathed in purple,
& wearing a crowne vpon his head: to others in the likenesse of a [e]Childe: sometime he sheweth
himselfe in the forme of foure-footed beastes, foules, creeping things, [f]roaring as a Lyon,
skipping like a Goat, barking after the manner of a dogge, and the like. But[g] it is obserued
by some, that he cannot take the shape of a Sheepe, or Doue, though of an Angell of light:
2. Cor. 11. 14. And further, [h]most of the learned doe hold, that those bodies wherein they
doe appeare, are fashioned of the[i] aire, (though it is not to be denied, but they can enter
into other, as the Diuell did into the Serpent, deceiuing Eue, Gen. 3. 1.) which if it continuing
pure and in the owne nature,[k] hath neither colour nor figure, yet condensed receiueth both,
as wee may behold in the clouds, which resemble sometime one, sometime another shape, and so
in them is seene the representation of Armies fighting, of beasts and Birds, houses, Cities,
and sundry other kinds of apparations.

Histories of all can witnesse of the Diuels appearance in human[l] shape: thus a Pseudo-Moses,
or Messias in Crete, perswaded the Iewes that it was he who brought their Fathers the Israelites
out of Egypt, and led them through the Red Sea, and would conduct them also out of that land
vpon the waters into Iudea. But many following his counsell, perished: the rest admonished
by that destruction, turned back, accusing their folly; and when they made enquiry for this
guide, to haue rewarded him according to his desert, was no where to be found, whereof they
conceiued hee was a Diuell in Mans likenesse. And such an one [m]was that merry (but malicious)
spirit, who walked for a long time in Saxony, and was very seruiceable, clothed in country
apparrell, with a cappe on his head, delighted to conuerse and talke with the people, to demaund
questions, and answer what he was asked, hurting none, except iniured before, and then declared
himselfe a right diuell in reuenge.

[n]The late Discoueries and Nauigations made into the west Indies, can furnish vs with abundant
testimonies hereof, in which the mindes of the inhabitants are both terrified & their bodies
massacred by his visible sight, and cruell tortures; yet (which is the opinion of many learned)
he cannot so perfectly represent the fashion of a mans body, but that there is some sensible
deformity, by which hee bewrayeth himselfe; as his [o]feete like those of an Ox, a Horse, or
some other beasts, clouen houed, his hands crooked, armed with clawes, or talants like a vulture:
or some one misshapen part, wherein (though hee delight in the shape of man, as most fitting
for company and conference) is demonstrated, the great and tender loue of God toward vs, who
hath so branded this deceiuer, that hee may bee discerned euen of those who are but of meane
capacity, and so consequently auoyded. And as in his body assumed, so in his speech there is
a defect, for it is weake, small, whispering, imperfect.

perceiued.

Neither can this seeme strange to any, that the Diuell should speake, who brought a voyce from
Trees to salute[r] Apollonius, and inspired that talkatiue Oke in Dodona, famous for the Oracles
vttered there in Heroicall verse, to the Grecians, and to euery nation in his owne language,
Chaldeans, Egyptians, Armenians, and other people who were led by him, and depended vpon his
resolution.

And considering, as hath beene mentioned before, that there passeth betweene the Witch and
her Diuell, a compact, as with a Maister and a Seruant, it must therefore consist vppon prescript
tearmes of commaunding, and obeying; and then of necessity is required a conuersing together;
and conference whereby the same couenant may be ratified.

    The sixt Proposition.

God giueth, both the diuell, and his seruants the witches, power sometimes to trouble his owne
children; so [a]Christ our blessed Sauiour, was by Sathan carryed from place to place, Math.
4. 5. Iob[b] in strange manner afflicted, and his children slaine, through his power, whom
none can conceiue but were Gods seruants, religiously brought vp in his feare: and their father
hath an honourable testimonie from the mouth of God himselfe, Iob 1. ver. 8. Dauid, a man according
to Gods owne heart, Acts 13. 22. is by Sathan stirred vp to number the people, 1. Chron. 21.
1. and that incuriosity and the pride of his heart, onelie to know the multitude of his subiects,
2. Sam. 24. 2.

    [Footnote a: Iaquerius in flagello hereticorum fascinariorum,
    cap. 19 & 20.]

    [Footnote b: Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum.]

Whereas the Law appoynteth another end, Exod. 30. 12. which hee had [c]now forgotten, the maintenance
of the Ministerie and worshippe of God. And a daughter of Abraham is bound of the diuell eighteene
whole yeeres, had a spirit of Infirmity, was bowed together, and could in no wise lift vp herselfe,
Lu. 13. 11.16. a grieuous calamity in respect of the author, the continuance, and the effect.
But to handle this poynt a little more distinctly; It shall not be amisse to open first some
reasons, why God doth giue this power to the diuel ouer the righteous his children sometimes,
as also vpon the wicked and disobedient to his will: And in the second place, why Witches haue
the like leaue graunted vnto them. Therefore for his children.

    [Footnote c: Iosephus +archaiologias+ lib. 7. sectione siue

The first reason of his permission is his inscrutable[d] wisedome, who
out of euill bringeth good; so Paul had a minister of Sathan to buffet
him, to keepe him in humility, that hee might not waxe proude and
high-minded, in regard of those great mysteries which were reuealed when
hee was taken into the third heauen, 2. Corint. 12. 4. Thus his
tentation was a medicine preseruatiue preuenting the disease of his
soule, which otherwise hee might haue falne into, [e]for both himselfe,
and the rest of the Apostles, though they were chosen vessells, yet were
they also fraile and brittle, wandring yet in the flesh vpon earth, not
triumphing securely in heauen. 13. apud quem etiam plura inuenies. Tertul. de fuga in

Second, It is[f] proceeding from his mercy and goodnes, for the trial of faith, obedience and
constancy in such as belong to God: whereof there is an excellent patterne, and vnparaleld
in Iob 1. 13.14. &c. for by this triall is made a proofe to examine whether wee doe continue
firme vpon our square, and vnshaken, or no; and be not remoued, eyther by the [g]seeming wonders
of the diuell, or of his seruants and associats. And therefore the Apostle pronounceth him
blessed, who endureth temptation, for when hee is tryed hee shall receiue the crowne of life,
which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him, Iames 1. 12. for he is faithfull, and wil
not suffer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able, but with the temptation also make a way
to escape, &c. 1. Cor. 10. 13.

Third, Wee are admonished alwayes to stand in a readines, and be armed for to fight, prepared
to withstand the diuell, knowing that God doth oftentimes giue him leaue to assault vs. Therefore
we haue need to be furnished in all points, for we wrastle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkenesse of this world,
against spirituall wickednesses in high places, Ephes. 6. 11.12. And 1. Pet. 5. 8.9. be sober
and vigilant, because your aduersary the diuell as a roaring Lyon walketh about, seeking whom
he may deuoure. He [h]is no weake assaylant, and therefore heere by the Apostle are noted in
him foure things: First, his power (a Lyon): Second, his hatred, and wrath in the word (roaring):
Third, his subtilty (walking about) obseruing euery oportunity and occasion to hurt vs: Fourth,
his cruelty (deuoure) no contentment but in our ruine and vtter destruction.

    [Footnote h: Strigelius in explicatione locorum Theologicorum
    Melanthonis parte 3. titulo de cruce & calamitatibus.]

Fourth, God would haue vs get the victorie against Sathan, and take knowledge, that Christ
on our side fighteth for vs, through whom we triumph, and so are made more vndoubtedly assured
of our saluation; and this is that which hee promised, The [i]Seed of the woman shall bruise
the head of the Serpent, Gen. 3. 15. And the Apostle confirmeth, God shall tread down Sathan
vnder your feete, Rom. 16. 20.

    [Footnote i: Augustinus de Genesi ad literam, l. 11. c. 22.]

God suffereth the diuell to preuaile against the wicked, yet in the most Holy there is no iniustice
2. Chron. 19. 7. But First, [k]Herein is the declaration of his iustice, whereby hee punisheth
obstinate sinners, & those who prouoke him to wrath, and will not repent: And thus it is sayd
of the Aegiptians, whom no plagues could soften, that hee cast vpon them the fiercenes of his
anger, and indignation, and trouble, by sending euill Angels among them, [l]Psalm 78. 49. And
when Saul had neglected the commandement of God, an euill spirit from the Lord troubled him,
1. Sam. 16. 14. Thus Ahab seduced by his false prophets descendeth into the battaile, and is
slaine (contemning the words of Michaiah) in[m] whose mouthes the diuell was a lying spirit,
who sent of the Lord, perswaded him and preuailed, 1. Kin. 22. 22.23.24.

    [Footnote k: Hyperius in locis Theolog. lib. 2.]

    [Footnote l: Augustinus in locuus consulatur.]

    [Footnote m: Vide Iaquerium in flagello hereticorum
    fascinariorum, cap. 23.]

Second, By affliction in the body or goodes, God[n] would quicken them vp to seeke the saluation
of their soules. And so Paul gaue ouer a scandalous and incestuous person vnto the diuell,
that he might be induced to forsake his sin, liue chastely heereafter, and be an edifying example
to those whom he had offended: and this kinde of discipline was more soueraigne, then any other
could haue beene, because mans nature abhorreth Sathan, and trembleth with feare once to conceiue
that he should fall into his power and hands, and this is that which he writeth, aduising the
Corinthians to deliuer him vnto Sathan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may
be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus, 1. Cor 5. 5. And in this sort he speaketh of two other
deceiuers and blasphemers, Hymenaus and Alexander, I haue deliuered them vnto Sathan, that
they may learne not to blaspheme, 1. Timothie 1. 20. therfore this giuing ouer, was not to
destruction, but for correction.

    [Footnote n: Idem cap. 21.]

The last poynt propounded, was, That witches haue power granted to vex Gods owne children aswell
as others, and preuaile ouer them; and that we doe enquire (so farre as we may, and is iustifiable)
of the causes thereof, which may be these.

First, [o]This is permitted vnto them for the experience of their faith and integrity, so that
by this meanes their loue towards God which lay hidden in the heart, is now made manifest.
To be quiet and patient in prosperity, when we may enioy benefites at our owne pleasure, is
a matter easily to be performed: But to endure the fire of Tribulation, that is the proofe
of a stedfast Christian, and in losses and sickenesse procured by such to bee silent, and submit
our selues, this is the note of a faithfull man, & to choose rather obeying the law of God,
to beare the infirmity of the body, then to ouer-flow in riches, and enioying health and strength
offend the Lord.

    [Footnote o: Trithemius in libel. 8 qu[e,]stionum quas illi
    dissoluendas proposuit Maximilianus Imperator, qu[e,]st 7.]

Second, this maketh a difference betweene the wicked and the godly: for thus the holy Apostle
speaketh of the righteous, that by many afflictions they must enter into the kingdome of heauen,
Act. 14. 22. And all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus suffer tribulations, 2. Timoth. 3.
12. for whom the Lord loueth, he doth chasten, Prouer. 3. 12. It is a Christians glory to vndergoe
for Gods cause, any vexation whatsoeuer, whether wrought by the diuell, or brought to passe
by wicked men his [p]instruments; for when he is tryed, hee shall receiue the crowne of life,
which God hath promised to those who loue him, Iames 1. 12. But wee reade contrary of the wicked,
they become olde, yea, are mighty in power, their seede is established in their sight with
them, and their of-spring before their eyes, their houses are safe from feare, neyther is the
rod of God vpon them, &c. they spend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go downe into the
graue, Iob 21. 7.8.9. &c. Yet surely they are set in slippery places, sodainely destroyed and
perished, & horribly consumed as a dreame when one awaketh: O Lord, thou shalt make their Image
despised, &c. Psal. 73. 18.19.20.

    The seuenth Proposition.

More women in a farre different proportion prooue Witches then men, by a
hundred to one; therefore the Lawe of God noteth that Sex, as more
subiect to that sinne, Exodus 22. 18. It is a common speach amongst
the Iewish Rabbins, [a]many women, many Witches: And it should seeme
that this was a generally receiued opinion, for so it is noted by
Pliny, Quintilian, and others, neyther doth this proceede (as some
haue thought) from their frailtie and imbecillity, for in many of them
there is stronger resolution, to vndergoe any torment then can bee found
in man, as was made apparant in that conspiracy of Piso against
Nero,[b] who commaunded that Epicharis, knowne to bee of the same
faction, should first presently be set vpon the racke,
    [Sidenote: Muliebre corpus impar dolori.]
imagining that being a woman, she would neuer bee able to ouercome the
paine: But all the tortures that he or his could deuise, were not able
to draw from her the least confession of any thing that was then
obiected against her. The first dayes question shee so vtterly
contemned, that the very Chaire in which they conueied her from the
place, did seeme as a Chariot wherein shee rid, triumphing ouer the
barbarous vsage of their inhumane cruelty. The morrow following brought
thither againe, after many rough incounters, remained so vnshaken, that
wrath it selfe grew madde, to see the strokes of an obstinate and
relenting fury fall so in vaine vpon the softer temper of a Woman: and
at the last tooke a scarfe from about her necke, and by it knits vp
within her bosome the knowledge shee had of that fact, together with
that little remainder of spirit, whereof by force and violence they
laboured to depriue her.

    [Footnote a: In Perkei ababboth. Bodinus in confutatione
    opinionis Wieri. Plinius in hist. natural. Quintilianus
    Institutionum oratoriarium lib. 5. cap. 10.]

    [Footnote b: Tacit. Annal. lib. 15.]

[c]Former ages haue likewise produced Leena, an exemplary president of this sort, to all posterity,
who when Armodius and Aristogiton hauing failed of the execution of their enterprise against
Hipparchus a tyrant, had beene put to death, she was brought to the torture to be enforced
to declare what other complices there were of the conspiracie. But rather then shee should
bee compelled thereunto, bit her tongue asunder, and spit it in the face of the tyrant, that
though she would, yet could not now disclose them. In remembrance whereof the Athenians caused
a Lyon of Brasse to bee erected, shewing her inuincible courage by the generosity of that beast,
and her perseuerance in secrecie, in that they made it without a tongue. Therefore the learned
haue searched out other causes thereof, and among the rest, obserued these as the most probable.

    [Footnote c: Tertul. in Apologet. Crinitus de doctrina Christiana
    lib. 9. cap. 8.]

First, they are by nature credulous, wanting experience, and therfore more easily deceiued.

Secondly, [d]they harbour in their breast a curious and inquisitiue desire to know such things
as be not fitting and conuenient, and so are oftentimes intangled with the bare shew and visard
of goodnesse. As the Lady of Rome, who was importune, and vehemently instant vpon her husband,
to know what was debated of that day at the Councell Table. And when he could not be at rest,
answered, The Priests had seene a Larke flying in the aire with a golden Helmet on his head,
and holding a speare in his foot. Scarce she had this, but presently she told it to one of
her maids: she to another of her fellowes, so that report was spread through the whole Citie,
and went for currant vntill it receiued a checke: But all are not of this mould.

    [Footnote d: Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum. Peucerus
    de pr[e,]cipius diuinationum generibus in titulo de +theomanteia+
    Martinus de Arles.]

Thirdly, their complection is softer, and from hence more easily receiue the impressions offered
by the Diuell; as when they be instructed and gouerned by good Angels, they proue exceeding
religious, and extraordinarily deuout; so consenting to the suggestions of euill spirits, become
notoriously wicked, so that there is no mischiefe aboue that of a woman, Eccles. 25. 13. &c.

Fourthly, in them is a greater facility to fall, and therefore the Diuell at the first took
that aduantage, and set vpon Eue in Adams absence, Genes. 3. 3.

Fifthly, this sex, when it conceiueth wrath or hatred against any, is vnplacable, possessed
with vnsatiable desire of reuenge, and transported with appetite to right (as they thinke)
the wrongs offered vnto them: and when their power herein answereth not their will, and are
meditating with themselues how to effect their mischieuous proiects and designes, the Diuell[e]
taketh the occasion, who knoweth in what manner to content exulcerated mindes, windeth himselfe
into their hearts, offereth to teach them the meanes by which they may bring to passe that
rancor which was nourished in their breasts, and offereth his helpe and furtherance herein.

    [Footnote e: Exemplum apud Binfeldium reperies de confessionibus
    maleficorum, pag. 32.]

Sixthly, they are of a slippery tongue, and full of words: and therefore if they know any such
wicked practises, are not able to hold them, but communicate the same with their husbands,
children, consorts, and inward acquaintance; who not consideratly weighing what the issue and
end thereof may be, entertaine the same, and so the poyson is dispersed. Thus Dalilah discouered
her husbands strength where it lay, vnto the Philistines; and procured his infamous and disastrous
ouer-throw. Judg. 16. 18.

Hitherto in some Propositions I haue set downe the originall of
witch-craft, and other such curious and vnlawfull Arts, the quality
of the persons agents in the same, the power of the Diuell, and his
confederates, the league of association which enterchangeably
passeth betweene them, his assuming a body, and framing a voice
  for the performance of that businesse; that women, and why,
       are most subiect to this hellish practice.
            Now the truth of all these shall
              appeare by exemplary proofes
                    in the Narration
                       following.

           *       *       *       *       *

           A true Narration of some of those
          Witch-crafts which Marie wife of
      Henry Smith Glouer did practise, and of the
 hurts she hath done vnto sundry persons by the same:
 confirmed by her owne Confession, and from the publike
Records of the examination of diuers vpon their oaths:
    of her death, and execution for the same, which
          was on the twelfth day of Ianuarie
                      last past.

Marie wife of Henrie Smith, Glouer, possessed with a wrathfull
indignation against some of her neighbours, in regard that they made
gaine of their buying and selling Cheese, which shee (vsing the same
trade) could not doe, or they better (at the least in her opinion) then
she did, often times cursed them, and became incensed with vnruly
passions, armed with a setled resolution, to effect some mischieuous
proiects and designes against them. The diuell who is skilfull, and
reioyceth of such an occasion offered and knoweth how to stirre vp the
euill affected humours of corrupt mindes (she becomming now a fitte
subject, through this her distemper, to worke vpon, hauing the
vnderstanding darkened with a cloude of passionate, and reuengefull
affections) appeared vnto her amiddes these discontentments,
    [Sidenote: Proposition 4.]
in the shape of a blacke man, and willed that the she should continue in
her malice, enuy, hatred, banning and cursing; and then he would be
reuenged for her vpon all those to whom she willed euill:
    [Sidenote: Proposition 5.]
and this promise was vttered in a lowe murmuring and hissing voyce: and
at that present they entred tearmes of a compact, he requiring that she
should forsake God, and depend vpon him: to which she condescended in
expresse tearmes, renouncing God, and betaking herselfe vnto him. I am
sparing by anie amplification to enlarge this, but doe barely and
nakedly rehearse the trueth, and number of her owne words vnto mee.
After this hee presented himselfe againe at sundry times, and that to
this purpose (as may probably bee coniectured) to hold her still in his
possession, who was not able, eyther to looke further into these
subtilties, then the superficiall barke thereof, or not discouer the
depth of his designements, and in other formes, as of a mist, and of a
ball of fire, with some dispersed spangles of blacke; and at the last in
prison (after the doome of iudegement, and sentence of condemnation was
passed against her) two seuerall times, in that figure as at the first:
only at the last he seemed to haue a paire of horns vpon his head, and
these as shee came downe from her chamber, being sent for to conferre
with some learned and reuerend Diuines, by whose prayers and
instructions she might be brought to the sight and confession of her
grieuous offences, be regained and rescued out of his hands, brought to
repentance, and the fauour of God, assured hope of mercie, and eternall
life, and at these times he wished her to confesse nothing to any of
them, but continue constant in her made promise, rely vpon him, and hee
would saue her. This was too high a straine aboue his reach to haue made
it good, and a note of his false descant, who hauing compassed this
wretched woman, brought her to a shamefull and vntimely end; yet doing
nothing herein contrary to his malicious purposes, for hee was a
murtherer from the beginning, Iohn 8. 44. Now then, to descend
to particulars, and the effects of this hellish association made.
Being thus joyned and linked together in a reciprocall league,
 he beginneth to worke for her, in procuring the mischiefe
       of those whom she maligned, whereof these
           few acknowleged by her selfe, may
               yeeld some taste of more,
                   though concealed.

    ¶ Her wicked practise against Iohn Orkton.

The first who tasted of the gall of her bitternes was Iohn Orkton a
Sailer, and a man of strong constitution of body, who about some fiue
yeares sithence, returning out of Holland in the Netherland, or low
Countries beyond the Seas, hapened, for some misdemeanors committed by
him to strike the sonne of this Mary Smith (but in such sort as could
not in reason bee offensiuely taken) who hearing his complaint, came
forth into the streete, cursing and banning him therefore, as oftentimes
shee did, dwelling in the next adioyning house, and wished in a most
earnest and bitter manner, that his fingers might rotte off; wherevpon
presently hee grew weake, distempered in stomacke, and could digest no
meate, nor other nourishment receiued, and this discrasie or feeblenesse
continued for the space of three quarters of a yeare; which time
expired, the fore-mentioned griefe fel downe from the stomacke into his
hands and feete, so that his fingers did corrupt, and were cut off; as
also his toes putrified & consumed in a very strange and admirable
manner. Neuerthelesse, notwithstanding these calamities, so long as hee
was able, went still to Sea, in the goods and shippes of sundry
Merchants (for it was his onely meanes of liuing) but neuer could make
any prosperous voyage (as then other men did) eyther beneficiall to the
Owners, or profitable to him selfe. Whereupon, not willing to bee
hindrance to others, and procure no good for his owne maintenance by his
labours, left that trade of life, and kept home, where his former griefe
encreasing, sought to obtaine help and remedie by Chirurgery, and for
this end went to Yarmouth, hoping to be cured by one there, who was
accompted very skilfull: but no medicines applyed by the Rules of Arte
and Experience, wrought any expected or hoped for effect: for both his
hands and feete, which seemed in some measure euery euening to be
healing, in the morning were found to haue gone backeward, and growne
far worse then before: So that the Chirurgian perceiuing his labour to
bee wholly frustrate, gaue ouer the cure, and the diseased patient still
continueth in a most distressed and miserable estate, vnto the which hee
was brought by the hellish practises of this malitious woman, who long
before openly in the streetes, (whenas yet the neighbours knew of no
such thing) reioycing at the calamity, said, Orkton now lyeth a
rotting. And no maruell though she could tell that which herselfe had
done, and her good maister would not suffer to be concealed, but that
the testimony of her owne tongue should remayne as a record towardes her
further detection and condemnation, who sought meanes of her voluntary
accord to be reconciled with the wofull distressed party, but this was
nothing else but to plaister ouer and disguise her former inhumane and
barbarous actions, for no reliefe at all followed thereof: for
oftentimes, as hath beene prooued, the diuells and witches his
    [Sidenote: Propositiõ 3.]
instruments doe cause such diseases, which neyther the one, nor the
other can remoue againe. And this is not any vaporous imagination, but
a most vndoubted trueth. For now this poore man continueth still in a
lamentable estate, griefe, and paines encreasing, without hope of helpe,
except God in the abundance of his tender mercies vouchsafe to grant
comfort and deliuerance.

    ¶ Her Wicked practise against Elizabeth Hancocke

The second person distressed, by this witch, was Elizabeth Hancocke, then widdow, now wife
of Iames Scot: the maner, occasion, and proceeding of whose dealing against her was thus. She
comming out of the towne from the shoppe of one Simon Browne a Silkeman, vnto whom she had
carried home some worke, which was by him put out vnto her; Henry Smith, as shee passed by
his doore, tooke her by the hand, and smilingly said, that his ducke (meaning his wife, this
woman of whome we now speake) told him that shee had stolne her henne; which wordes she then
passed ouer, as onely spoken in merriment, and denying the same: in the meane time, as they
were interchanging these words, shee came herselfe, and directly charged her with the henne,
and wished that the bones thereof might sticke in her throat, when she should eate the same:
which speech also she made no great reckoning of, supposing them to be but words of course,
and might bee vttered in jeast. Neuerthelesse, afterward better considering of the same, conceiued
much griefe, to bee counted one of so euill quality and disposition, and espying that hen for
which she was accused, to sit vpon the hatch of her shoppe doore, went to her, and mooued with
the indignity of that slaunder, and vniust imputation, told her in some passion and angry manner,
that it was a dishonest part thus to blemish the good name of her neighbors with so vntrue
aspersions: whereupon, breaking foorth in some violence, she wished the pox to light vpon her,
and named her prowde Iinny, prowde flurts, and shaking the hand, bade her go in, for she should
repent it; and the same night, within three or foure houres after these curses and imprecations
vttered, she was taken and pinched at the heart, and felt a sodaine weaknesse in all the parts
of her body; yet her appetite to meare nothing diminished, and so continued for the space of
three weekes; in which time, when she was any thing well, would come to the doore, and leane
vpon the stall, whom this Marie Smith seeing, did euer banne, adding the former curse, the
poxe light vpon you, can you yet come to the doore? and at the end of these three weekes, beeing
but very weake, came foorth as shee vsed to doe, to take the ayre, this mischieuous woman most
bitterly cursed her againe, whereupon she went into the house, fell into such a torturing fit,
and nipping at the heart, that she fainted, hardly recouerable for the space of halfe an houre,
and so grieuously racked and tormented through all parts of her body, as if the very flesh
had beene torne from the bones, by the violent paine whereof she could not refraine, but tore
the haire from off her head, and became as one distraught, bereaued of sence, and vnderstanding:
And the same night the bed whereon she lay, was so tossed, and lifted vp and downe, both in
her owne feeling, and in the sight of others then present beholders of her extreamities, by
the space of one houre or more, that she was therewith exceedingly terrified, & did thinke
oftentimes in her sleepe, that she did see this Marie Smith standing before her. And this fit
continued sixteene houres, during which passion Edward Drake her father came to the Towne,
touched with griefe for this torture of his daughter (as parents hearts are relenting and tender,
and naturall compassion is soone stirred vp in them) tooke her vrine, went to one for his aduice
(whose fact herein is no way iustifiable, and argued but a small measure of religion, and the
knowledge of God in him) who first tolde vnto him the cause of his comming, that is, to seeke
help for his daughter, and then added, that she was so farre spent, that if hee had stayed
but one day longer, the woman who had wronged her, would haue spent her heart, and so become
vnrecouerable, and thereupon shewed him her face in a Glasse; and further, opened the beginning
cause of falling out, which was for a hen, which before this, Drake neyther knew nor heard
of, and then gaue his counsell for remedy, which was the matter sought for & desired, & that
was in this order. To make a cake with flower from the Bakers, & to mix the same instead of
other liquor, with her own water, and bake it on the harth, wherof the one halfe was to be
applyed and laid to the region of the heart, the other halfe to the back directly opposit;
& further, gaue a box of ointment like triacle, which must be spread vpon that cake, and a
powder to be cast vpon the same, and certaine words written in a paper, to be layd on the likewise
with the other, adding this caueat, that if his daughter did not amend within six houres after
the taking of these receits, then there was no health or recouery to be looked for: & further,
wished silence to be kept herein, for the womã who had done this, would know any thing.

And being thus furnishing with instructions, and returning home, as shee alighted from his
horse to enter into that house where his daughter lay (being the next vnto Mary Smiths) shee
then stood leaning ouer her shop window, whom hee knew to be that person, which was shewed
vnto him, and she cursed him passing by, and told his daughter that her Father had beene with
a Wisard. And the next day following after they had put in practise the directions giuen, she
affirmed to diuers of the neighbours, that Drake the afflicted womans father, had beene to
aske counsell, and made a Witch Cake, but shee would learne how they came to haue that knowledge:
yet for the present she found helpe, and was freed from the languishing and other conflicts
wherewith she was assaulted by the space of sixe weekes.

After this, being married vnto Iames Scot, a great Cat which kept with this Witch (of whose
infernall both purposes and practises wee now speake) frequented their house; and vpon doing
some scathe, her husband moued therwith, thrust it twice through with his sword: which notwithstanding
those wounds receiued, ran away: then he stroke it with all his force vpon the head with a
great pike staffe, yet could not kill her; but shee leapt after this vpward almost a yard from
the boords of that chamber where she now was, and crept downe: which hee perceiuing, willed
his lad (a boy of foureteene yeares) to dragge her to the muck-hill, but was not able; and
therefore put her into a sacke, and being in the same, still moued and stirred. Whereupon they
put her out againe, and cast her vnder a paire of staires, purposing in the morning, to get
more helpe, and carry her away; but then could not be found, though all the doores that night
were locked, and neuer heard what afterward became thereof.

Not long after, this Witch came forth with a Birchin broome, and threatned to lay it vpon the
head of Elizabeth Scot, and defiled her cloathes therewith, as she swept the street before
her shop doore, and that in the sight of her husband, who not digesting this indignity offered
vnto his wife, threatned that if she had any such fits, as she endured being a Widow before
marriage, hee would hang her. At this she clapped her hands, and said hee killed her Cat. And
within two or three dayes after this enterchange of words betweene them, his wife was perplexed
with the like paine and griefe at her heart, as formerly she had beene; and that for two dayes
and a night: wherefore her husband went to this wrathfull and malicious person, assuring that
if his wife did not amend, hee would accuse her to the Magistirate, and cause the [a]rigor
of the law to be executed vpon her, which is due to such malefactors. These things were done
some three yeares sithence. The party troubled yet liueth, but in no confirmed health, nor
perfect soundnesse of body.

    recall the mischiefe they haue done, as by threats and stripes.

    Her wicked practises against Cicely Balye.

A third subiect whereupon this wrathfull womans anger wrought, was Cicely Balye, then seruant
to Robert Coulton, now wife of William Vaux, who sweeping the street before her maisters doore
vpon a Saturday in the euening, Mary Smith began to pick a quarrell about the manner of sweeping,
and said vnto her she was a great fat-tail'd sow, but that fatnesse should shortly be pulled
downe and abated. And the next night being Sunday immediatly following, a Cat came vnto her,
sate vpon her breast, with which she was grieuously tormented, and so oppressed, that she could
not without great difficulty draw her breath, and at the same instant did perfectly see the
said Mary in the chamber where she lay, who (as she conceiued) set that Cat vpon her, and immediatly
after fell sicke, languished, and grew exceeding leane; and so continued for the space of halfe
a yeare together, during the whole continuance in her maisters seruice; vntill departing from
him, she dwelt with one Mistres Garoway, and then began to bee amended in her health, and recouer
of her former pining sicknesse: for this Witch had said, that so long as she dwelt neere her,
she should not be well, but grow from euill to worse.

Thus euery light trifle (for what can be lesse then sweeping of a lttle dust awry?) can minister
matter to set on fire a wrathfull indignation, and inflame it vnto desired reuenge, the Diuell
being willing to apprehend and take hold vpon such an occasion, that so he might do some pleasing
office to his bond-slaue, whom she adored in submisse manner, vpon her knees, with strange
gestures, vttering many mumuring, broken, and imperfect speeches, as this Cicely did both heare
and see, there being no other partition between the chamber wherein shee performed these rites,
and the house of her maister with whom she then dwelt, but only a thin seeling of boord, through
a cranny or rift of whereof she looked, listned attentiuely vnto her words, and beheld diligently
her behauiour, and might haue seene and heard much more, but that she was with the present
spectacle so affrighted, that she hastened downe in much feare and distemper.

    Her wicked practise against Edmund Newton.

The fourth endammaged by this Hagge, was one Edmund Newton: the discontentment did arise from
this ground; Because hee had bought seuerall bargaines of Holland cheese, and sold them againe,
by which she thought her benefit to be somewhat impaired, vsing the like kinde of trading.
The manner of her dealing with him was in this sort. At euery seuerall time buying Cheese he
was grieously afflicted, being thrice, and at the last either she or a spirit in her likenesse
did appeare vnto him, and whisked about his face (as he lay in bed) a wet cloath of very loathsome
sauour; after which hee did see one cloathed in russet with a little bush beard, who told him
hee was sent to looke vpon his fore legge, and would heale it; but rising to shew the same
perceiuing hee had clouen feet, refused that offer, who then (these being no vaine conceits,
or phantasies, but well aduised and diligently considered obseruances) suddenly vanished out
of sight. After this she sent her Impes, a Toad, and Crabs crawling about the house, which
was a shoppe planchered with boords, where his seruants (hee being a Shooemaker) did worke:
one of which tooke that toad, put it into the fire, where it made a groaning noyse for one
quarter of an houre before it was consumed; during which time Mary Smith who sent it, did endure,
(as was reported) torturing paines, testifying the felt griefe by her out-cryes then made.

The sicknesse which he first sustained, was in manner of a madnesse or phrensie, yet with some
interposed release of extremity: so that for thirteene or foureteene weekes together hee would
be of perfect memory, other times distracted and depriued of all sence. Also the ioynts and
parts of his body were benummed, besides other pains and greifes from which hee is not yet
freed, but continueth in great weakenesse, disabled to performe any labour, whereby hee may
get sufficient and competent maintenance. And by the councel of some, sending for this woman
by whom hee was wronged, that he might scratch her (for this hath gone as currant, and may
plead prescription for warrant a* foule sinne among Christians to thinke one Witch-craft can
driue out another) his nailes turned like feathers, hauing no strength to lay his hands vpon her.

And it is not improbable but that she had dealt no better with others then these aboue mentioned.
For M^r Thomas Yonges of London, Fishmonger, reported vnto me, that after the demand of a debt
due vnto M^r Iohn Mason, Silkeman of the same Citie, whose Widow hee married, from Henry Smith
Glouer her husband, some execrations and curses being wished vnto him, within three or foure
dayes (being then gone to Yarmouth in Norfolke vpon necessary businesse) there fell sicke,
and was tortured with exceeding and massacring griefes, which by no meanes (hauing vsed the
aduise of sundry learned and experienced Physitians in Norwich) could in any part be mitigated,
and so extraordinarily vexed thirteene moneths, was constrained to go on Crutches, not being
able to feed himselfe, and amended not before this mischieuous woman was committed to prison
(accused for other wickednesses of the like kinde) at which time (so neere as he could conjecture)
he then receiued some release of his former paines, though at the present when hee made this
relation, which was at Candlemas last past, had not perfectly recouered his wonted strength:
for his left hand remained lame, and without vse.

But thus much by the way onely, omitting how before this accident a great Water-dogge ranne
ouer his bed, the doore of the chamber where he lay being shut, no such one knowne (for carefull
enquiry was made) either to haue been in that houfe where hee lodged, or in the whole Towne
at any time.

I doe not insist vpon this, because shee did not nominate him or any other vnto vs, but onely
those foure already expressed: and for the wrongs done to them, she craued mercy at Gods hands,
as for all other her sins, and in particular for that of Witch-craft, renounced the Diuell,
embraced the mercies of God purchased by the obedience of Iesus Christ, and professed that
her hope was onely by his suffering and passion to bee saued. And all these, that is to say,
her former grieuous offences committed against God, and his people, her defiance of the Diuell,
and reposing all confidence of saluation in Christ Iesus alone, and his merits, she in particular
maner confessed openly at the place of execution, in the audience of multitudes of people gathered
together (as is vsuall at such times) to be beholders of her death. And made there also profession
of her faith, and hope of a better life hereafter; and the meanes whereby she trusted to obtaine
the same, as before, hath beene specified. And being asked, if she would be contented to haue
a Psalm sung, answered willingly that she desired the same, and appointed it herselfe, The
Lamentation of a Sinner, whose beginning is, Lord turne not away thy face, &c. And after the
ending thereof thus finished her life: So that in the iudgement of charity we are to conceiue
the best, and thinke shee resteth in peace, notwithstanding her heynous transgressions formerly
committed: for there is no maladay incurable to the Almighty Physitian, Esay 1. 18 Ezech. 33.
11. Therefore Caine did iniury to God, when conuicted of the barbarous and vnnaturall murther
of his righteous brother, cryed out tht his sinne was greater then could be forgiuen, Gen.
4. 13 for Gods mercy is greater then mans misery can be. And euen for the like vnto this very
fact, we haue a booke case, already adiudged, and ouer-ruled in those Ephesians, who brought
their coniuring bookes, sacrificed them in the fire, æstimated at the [b]value of nine hundred
pounds of our money, repented of their[c] sinnes, and obtained mercy, Acts 19. vers. 19.

    [Footnote b: Bud[e,]us de asse. lib. 5.]

    [Footnote c: The Ephesians were infamous for their Magicall
    practises, Appollonius professing the same in the Citie, so that
    it grewe into a prouerb, +grammata Ephesia+ the Ephesian letters,
    which were certaine Characters and wordes, by vertue whereof they
    obtained good successe in all businesse, victory against others,
    euasion and escape from dangers; and as we reade in Suidas, a
    Milesian armed with these letters, ouer-came thirty Champions in
    the games of Olimpus, but being remoued by the Magistrate,
    hauing intelligence thereof, himselfe was subdued. Of these see
    Athen[e,]us Deipnosophiston lib. 12. Hesichius in his
    Lexicon. Plutarchus quæstionum conuiualium, lib 7. cap. 5.]

    ¶ The eight Proposition, and first consequent.

Now then from this premised narration, these two corrollaries or consequents do necessarily follow.

It is not lawfull for any Christian to consult with a witch or wisard, or goe to them for helpe.
God himselfe, whose commandement is and must be the rule of our life & direction hath forbidden
it, Leuit. 19. 31. and 20. 6. Deuter. 18. 10.11. And the Imperiall lawes, haue beene in this
case verie respectiue.[a] Therefore, Leo the Emperour straitly enioyneth, that none should
resort vnto them, and stileth their aduice nothing but meere impostures and deceit; and in
the [b]Decrees collected by Gratian, the teachers of the people are seriously exhorted to admonish
them, that magicall arts and inchantments cannot heale any infirmity: and that they bee the
dangerous snares, and subtilties of that ancient enemy of mankind, by which he indeuoureth
to entangle them[c]: and these so streight and seuere prohibitions are not without iust and
weighty cause. For,

    [Footnote a: Cod lib. 9. titulo 18. L. nullus & L. Nemo.]

    [Footnote b: Gratianus decretorum parte 2. caus. 26. qu. 7.]

    [Footnote c: Danæus in dialogo de sortiarijs cap. 6.]

First, wee must haue no commerce or dealing with the diuell, eyther directly and immediately,
or mediately and indirectly; for we ought to haue our recourse to God alone in all distresses,
and this is that which Eliah spake with great indignation vnto the messengers of Ahaziah, who
went to enquire of Baal-zelub, for the recouerie of their Lords health, 2. King. 1. 3.[d] So
that wee must not seeke to Sathan, or any of his ministers. For none can serue two maisters,
Matt. 6. 24. But as religious Iehosaphat, when we know not what to doe, then lift vp our eyes
to heauen, 2 Chron. 20. 12.

    [Footnote d: Martinus de Arles in tractatu de superstitionibus.
    Iohannes Gerson de erroribus circa artem magicam articulo 5.]

Secondly, that help which any receiue from them bringeth destructon of our soules, for such
as seeke for relief this way, make a[e] separation & departing from God, which is the death
of the soule. And though it may be obiected, that some haue receiued benefite hereby, yet these
are not one of tenne. And further, wee are not to iudge heerein of the lawfulnesse of these
actions by the successe, but rest vpon the commaundement, for it falleth out sometime, that
a thiefe and common robber by the high way, may liue in more aboundance, then those who with
a lawfull and honest trade painefully maintaine themeelues, yet therefore hee is not iustified.
And when wee haue recourse vnto others beside God, we bewray herein our [f]distrust, infidelitie,
contempt and rebellion against him, which grieuous sinnes bring his wrath and eternall destruction.
But let it be taken for granted, that wee may receiue good by them, yet this maxime is sure,
& a truth vnrepealeable, which no distinction can elude; we must not doe euill that good may
come thereof, Rom. 3. 8.[g] yea, it were better to end our dayes in any extremitie whatsoeuer,
then to vse these for our helpers.

    [Footnote e: In curing diseases the diuell respecteth two ends:
    the one, that he might seeme to keep the promise he hath made with
    those his slaues, and retaine them in their malicious practises
    and infidelity: the other, that hee might draw their faith and
    trust from God, who are thus healed by witches and wisards his
    instruments, and cast them downe headlong into destruction of
    their soules: or if they misse of hoped reliefe which often times
    so commeth to passe, God withstanding their attempts, then to
    wound their consciences, and driue them to despaire.]

    [Footnote f: Nauarrus in Enchiridio siue manuali confessariorum
    cap 11.]

    [Footnote g: Chrysost. cont. Iud[e,]os hom 6.]

Thirdly, they[h] cure not diseases but in shew, except such as themselues haue inflicted, otherwise
those doe returne, as is reported of Adrianus the[i] Emperour, who troubled with a dropsie,
by magicall charmes did oftentimes empty the water thereof, but in a short space increased
againe; and perceiuing the same to grow worse & worse, sought to dispatch and rid himselfe
of life, by poyson, or the sword, or some other desperate attempts. Or a worse malady (the
first being abated) followeth: as I haue knowne one, who vsing the help of a wisard for the
cure of a sore in his breast, prescribed in this sort: crossed the place affected with his
thumb, and mumbled to himself some words in secret, after gaue the patient a powder like the
ashes of wood, which was to be boiled in running water, and with it to wash the vlcer, after
certaine clouts were to be applyed, with speciall care to lay that side of the clout vnto the
sore, which was by him crossed, and marked; and all these clothes must at once be bound vpon
it, and euery day the lowest remoued or taken away: thus in short time that anguish and griefe
ceased; but not long after the party fell into a more grieuous infirmity, and still continueth
therein. Or if the euill be taken from the[k] person presently afflicted, then is it layd vpon
his friends children or cattell, and sometime it falleth to the lot of the witch herselfe,
so that alwayes the diuell is a diuell, doing euill, and working mischiefe.

    epimplato.+]

    [Footnote k: Bodine proueth this by many examples in his
    Dæmonomania, lib. 3. cap. 2.]

Fourth, a [l]wisard, witch, or sorcerer can not releeue any but by his or her inuocation, and
help of the diuell, but this fact is absoluteIy, and without exception, wicked, and can by
no limitation or circumstance bee made tolerable: Therefore they who require this at their
hands, which they cannot performe without committing of sinne, be liable to the same vengeance
and wrath of God to which they are; for not only the principall offenders, but the [m]accessaries,
and consenters to their euill, are worthy of death, Rom. 1. 32.

    [Footnote l: Binfeldius de confessionibus maleficorum. Cardinalis
    Caietanus in summula titulo de maleficio. Toletus in summa casuum
    conscientiæ, sine instructione sacerdotum li. 4. c. 16.]

    [Footnote m: Gratianus in Decretis parte 2, causa 26. qu[e,]st.
    2. sect. Qui sine saluatore, &c.]

Now before I conclude this poynt, because by these kinde of creatures, many toyes bee vsed,
to shaddow and maske the diuells suggestion and workes, it shall not be amisse to mention some
of them, and among the rest be [n]characters written or grauen in plates of mettall: and for
these it is most certayne that Quantities haue no actiue qualitie; and therefore, if any expected
successe according to desire doe follow in the vse thereof, it proceedeth from the illusion
of Sathan, and is his worke, that hereby he might winne credite to his crafty fleights and
conueyances, and procure to himselfe authority, establishing the kingdome of darknesse, withdraw
men from resting vpon God, and reposing their trust in his almighty power, and boundlesse mercy,
and sollicite them to expect helpe from him. There are besides these, other idle trifles (for
they deserue no better name which are appoynted to be hung about the neck) for Amulets, as
[o]powerfull and effectuall remedies against certayne diseases, and pictures made of gold,
brasse, lead, wax, &c. which neyther haue nor can haue any other vertue, then that which they
doe receiue from the matter wherof they be framed, for the figure worketh not as a cause of
alteration; but if it bring to passe any other effect that is from the power of the diuell
an old enemy, and craftie deluder of mankinde, and therefore, presupposeth a contract made
with him: wherefore [p]Antoninus Caracalla condemned those who vsed the same, for the helpe
of Tertian and Quartan agues, and Constantius[q] decreeth such to be woorthy capitall punishment,
and put to death. And that naturall couer wherewith some children are borne, and is called
by our women, the sillie how, Midwiues were wont to sell to credulous Aduocates and Lawyers,
as an especiall meanes to furnish them with eloquence[r] and perswasiue speech, and to stoppe
the mouthes of all, who should make any opposition against them: for which cause one [s]Protus
was accused by the Clergie of Constantinople to haue offended in this matter. And Chrysostome
often accuseth Midwiues for reseruing the same to Magicall vses. And Clemens[t] Alexandrinus
giueth vs to vnderstand of one Erecestus, who had two inchaunted rings, so framed, that by
the sound thereof he had direction for the fit time and oportunity in mannaging all the businesses
hee intended, and yet notwithstanding was priuily murthered, though hee had warning giuen by
that sound which was his vsuall instructer. Thus, none can escape the reuenging hand of God,
which pursueth those who haue infeoffed themselues to such vanities, and are besotted with
these vnlawfull curiosities. But among all other, charmes and inchaunting spells, haue gotten
the start of the rest, which some think absolutely lawfull, and may vpon warrantise bee vsed,
and pleade prescription for their iustification; for wee reade in Homer[u] that Vlysses being
wounded by words, stayed the flux of blood; and [x]Cardanus tells vs, that himselfe cutting
his lip, could by no meanes restraine the flowing blood, vntill he charmed it, and then presently
stanched: but dare not affirm whether his owne confidence, or the words did make this restraint.
I might adde to these, that infallible meanes (as is supposed) by finding out a thiefe with
a Siue and a payre of Sheares, with that coniunction [y]Dies, mies, Iescet, &c. and the rest
of such sencelesse and monstrous tearmes, a Riddle that Oedipus himselfe could not vnfolde.
But because this conceit of charming hath ouer-spread it selfe in this Sunneset of the world,
and challengeth a lawfull approbation from the authority and practise of ancient [z]Physitians,
yea and found some [aa]Diuines to be their Patrons respectiuely, and with clauses of mitigation,
I thinke it very necessarie to shew the vnlawfulness thereof. Wherefore,

First, they had their originall and beginning from the diuell, who abode not in the truth,
Iohn 8. 44. was cast downe with the apostata angels to hell, and deliuered into chaines of
darkenesse, 2. Pet. 2. 4. who enuying mans felicity receiued into grace after the [bb]fall,
himselfe eternally reiected, omitted no occasion to weaken and ouerthrow the same, that the
benefite thereof might come but to a few, and the greatest number perish with him for euer.
Whereupon he endeuoured to inwrappe the weaker sort of that fraile corporation in superstitions,
beguile them with doubtfull and false oracles, and bring to a forme of worshippe contrary to
that which God had commaunded, [cc]whereby the world beganne to abound with Idolatry, disobedience,
contempt, murthers, vncleanenesse, lusts, thefts, lying, and such like outrages: and that hee
might with his infections impoyson them more dangerously, and soueraigne in their hearts, he
vndertooke to worke wonders, imitating such miracles as God had done, and deuised cunningly
many subtile sleights and legerdemaines, and for this end most blasphemously abused the glorious
and holy name of God, and the word vttered by his mouth, and represented a false shew of those
effects, which hee had wrought in nature: and heerein leuelled at two intentions, one to reproch
God, and counterchecke his works; the other to ouer-mask and couer his owne secret traps and
frauds, perswading men, that by the power of wordes these things were brought to pass, which
must needes therefore be of great efficacie: seeing that the world & all things therein were
so made of nothing; for he spake, and they were created, and thus practised to disgrace, and
extenuate, that admirable and great worke of Creation, and cause men to make lighter account
of the Creator, seeing that they also (instructed by him) were enabled thorow the pronunciation
of certayne words contriued into a speciall forme, eyther to infuse new strength into things,
or depriue them of that which formerly they had, or alter the course of Nature, in raysing
tempests, stirring vp thunder and lightning; in [dd]taming serpents, and depriuing them of
their naturall fiercenesse and venime, and cause wilde beasts to become meeke and tractable,
yea in seeming to make sensible bodies; as cloudes, wind, raine & the like. And thus the diuell
is that father who begot Charmes, and brought them foorth, not powerfull in themselues, but
by that inter-league which hee hath with those who are invassaled vnto him.

Secondly, God doth as straitly prohibit them, and seuerely punish the practisers thereof, as
others offending in any exercise of vnlawfull arts, Deut. 18. 10.11. There shall not be found
among you (instructing the Israelites his people) a charmer, &c. for these are abhomination
vnto the Lord, &c. And this is recorded in the Catalogue of those sinnes of Manasses, by which
hee sought to prouoke God vnto anger, 2. Kin. 21. 8. 2. Chronicles 33. 6.

Thirdly, words haue no vertue,[ee] but either to signifie and expresse the conceits of the
minde, or to affect the eares of the Auditors, so that they can worke nothing but in these
two respects: first of the matter which is vttered by them, which vnderstood of the hearers,
affect the mind diuersly, and that especially when there is ioyned with it a comelinesse of
action and pronunciation, as wee we see oftentimes in the speeches of the Ministers of the
Word, and in the pleadings of Orators. As when Paul reasoned before F[oe]lix and Drusilla his
wife, of Temperance, Righteousnesse, and Iudgement to come, hee trembled, Acts 24. 25. [ff]being
guilty to himselfe of fraudulent and cruell dealing, of lasciuiousnesse and a filthy life,
and therefore might iustly feare vengeance for the same.

    exercuit.]

A like example to this is that in King Agrippa, though working vpon a better subject, Act.
26. 28. And if I may conioyne Diuine eloquence with Humane, it is memorable, that while [gg]Tully
pleaded before Cæsar for Ligarius, accused by Tubero, to haue beene confederate with Pompey,
purposing to put him to death, as an enemy, when the Orator altered, and in Rhetoricall manner
inforced his speech, the other changed accordingly his countenance, and bewrayed the piercing
words to be so affecting, that the supplications, when he came once to vrge and mention the
battell of Pharsalia, (trembling and dismayed) did fall from his hands, hauing the passions
of his minde extraordinarily moued, and absolued the offender. Or else when by their pleasantnesse,
with delight they slide into the hearts of men, and rauish their affections: and thus it was
with [hh]Augustine, as he acknowledgeth of himselfe, that being at Milaine where he was baptized
by S. Ambrose, when he heard the harmony which was in singing of the Psalmes, the words pierced
his eares, the truth melted his heart, his passions were moued, and showers of teares with
delight fell from his eyes.[ii] But these effects are wrought onely in such who vnderstand
that which is spoken, but neither of both these properties are to bee found in the Charmes
of Wisards: besides, that they are conceiued and expressed in monstrous and vnknowne tearmes,
not intelligible, and without signification: and therefore the effects they produce being[kk]
supernaturall must proceed from that secret compact, the least made with the Diuell.

Fourthly, these charmes are meere mockeries, and grosse abuses, both of God, and Men his creatures,
I will giue you a taste of one or two, whereby you may iudge of the rest, for they came all
out of one shoppe, and are fashioned in one forge, and haue the same workman or Artificer.
[ll]An old woman crauing helpe for bleare eyes, had deliuered a Billet of Paper to weare about
her necke, in which was written, The Diuell pull out thine eyes, and recouered. Anothere tied
a scroule to a sicke man, full of strange Characters, with which were intermingled a few names
of Diuels, as Lucifer, Sathan, Belzebub, Oriens, Behal, Mammon, Beuflar, Narthin, Oleasar,
&c. and other of this sort; but what manner of blessing this was, and how likely to be medicinable,
a Christian truely instructed in Gods word knoweth; and the Lord who is the father of mercies,
and God of all comfort, preserue vs from such blasphemies, which are the Diuels Sacrifices.

    [Footnote ll: Godelmannus in tractatu de magis, Veneficis &c.

Fifthly, the discreeter sort among the Heathen, by that small glimpse of naturall reason which
they had, misliked of these things: [mm]And therefore Cato among the rest of admonitions to
the Bailiffe of his husbandry, giueth this charge, to aske no aduice of any Southsaier, Diuiner,
Wisard, or Natiuity Calculator. [nn]And Columella vtterly forbiddeth all acquaintance with
Witches, wherby ignorant people are inforced to expence detestable Arts, and mischieuous deeds.
[oo]Hippocrates doth almost like a Christian discourse of this poynt, and condemne the whole
practise of this Art, as iniurious vnto God, who onely purgeth sinnes, and is our preseruer;
and for these fellowes who make profession of such wonder-working, brandeth them for Impostors
and deceiuers. I conclude with that remarkeable saying of an ancient Diuine;[pp] These vanities
doe separate and with-draw vs from God, though they may seeme to haue something in them to
allure and delight vs; yet let no Christian entertaine them, whose hope ought to be setled
in God alone. And if thou be in distresse, or afflicted with sicknesse of body, and feele no
present release or comfort, what then? here is the tryall of thy patience, haue not recourse
to superstitious and vnlawfull helpers, although they promise thee present remedy; and when
they fore-tell thee of things which doe truely according to the prediction to fall out, beleeue
them not, follow the example of Christ, who rebuked the Diuell, though he called him (as he
was indeed) the Son of God. For vnder the vaile of truth he shadoweth falshood; euen as if
one should sweeten with honey or sugar the brimme of the Cup wherein he bringeth poyson: But
some will say, they call vpon the name of the Lord of Sabbaoth. Well, but this title they giue
not to God, but to the Diuell: therefore betake thou thy selfe to God alone, craue health at
his hand, and follow the Apostles direction; If any bee sicke among you, let him call for the
Elders of the Church, and let him pray, Iames 5. 14.

    The ninth Proposition, and second Corrolary.

There hath alwayes beene some wanton, or peruerse wits, who only to make triall of their skill,
would take in hand to defend absurd positions, and commend both such things and persons, which
were infamous, and contemptible as [a]Phauorinus writ the praise of the Quartane Ague, one
of the gout, blindnesse, and deafness, [b]Lucian of a flye, [c]Erasmus of folly, [d]Synesius
of baldnesse, [e]Glaucus in Plato of iniustice. And among the exercises of the [f]ancient Orators,
wee finde those who strained all their vnderstanding to blaze the honour of that witlesse and
deformed Coward Thersites. And this they haue performed with great Art and eloquence, onely
to shew their faculty, but neuer in good earnest took such a matter in hand. And therefore
more deeply is hee to be censured, who hath made himselfe an aduocate to plead the cause of
[g]Witches, and defend th[~e] as innocent. And because this is a dangerous example, and doth
draw those who are euill affected to offend, hoping for patronage of their impiety, I adde
for conclusion this last proposition: Wisards, Witches, and the whole rabble of Sorcerers (no
kinde excepted) are iustly liable[h] to extreame punishment. The arguments alleaged for proofe
hereof, are many: I will make choyce of a few (with reference to such authors in whose writings
more may bee found) and those which are most[i] demonstratiue.

    [Footnote a: Phauorinus apud Agellium. lib. 17. cap. 12.]

    declamationibus.]

    [Footnote g: Wierus.]

    [Footnote h: Simlerus in 22 Exodi.]

    [Footnote i: Of these all the following reasons. Binfeldius de
    confessionibus maleficorum, & in Commentarijs ad titulum legis de
    maleficis & mathematicis copiosè. Remigius de D[e,]monologia, lib.
    3. cap. vltimo. Peucerus de pr[e,]cipuis Diuinationum generibus.
    Erastus de Lamijs. Bodinus Dæmonomanias lib. 4. cap. Secondly, that though their fault may
seeme, as being the weaker, excuseable, and is in this respect
extenuated by some, yet is not therefore to bee spared, whether of that
sort which they call [l]good, or bad (for so are they distinguished) &
there be some who neuer brought[m] harme vpon any in body, goods, or
minde. The cause of this so sharpe a doome, is their compacting with the
Diuell, openly or secretly, whereby they couenant to vse his helpe, in
fulfilling their desires, and by this meanes make themselues guilty of
horrible impiety: for in this they renounce the Lord, who hath created
them; make no account of his fauour and protection, cut themselues off
from the couenant made with him in baptisme, from the communion of
Saints, the true fellowship and seruice of God; and on the contrary
yeeld themselues by this confederacy, to Sathan, as their God (and
therefore nothing more frequent and vsuall in their mouthes, then my God
will do this and that for me) him they continually feare and honour. And
thus do at the last become professed enemies both to God and Man. You
may adde to this former law, that which is Leuit. 19. 26. & cap. 6.
You shall vse no inchantment: the soule that turneth after such as haue
familiar spirits, and are Wisards, to goe a whooring after them, I will
set my face against that soule, and will cut him off from among his
people, &c. Againe, Deut. 18. 10. There shall not bee found among
you any that vseth Diuination, nor an obseruer of times, or an
inchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, a Wisard, or Necromancer. And that God might shew how[n] much
Manasses had prouoked him to wrath, through his transcendent and
outragious sinnes in the Catalogue thereof, his conspiring with Diuels
is mentioned 1. King 21. 8. And therefore is depriued of his kingdome,
bound in fetters, and carried captiue vnto Babel, 2. Chron. 33.
6.11. and though he repented of these outragious and enormious
transgressions, yet God would not bee appeased for them fiftie yeares
after he was dead, Ierem. 15. 4.

    Mathematicis & Maleficis.]

    [Footnote n: Godelmannus de Magis & veneficis, lib. 3. cap. 11.
    nº. 14. 15. 16. & seq.]

Secondly, the ciuill lawes in this case are most strict, decreeing them to bee burned, and
their goods confiscate, though they were persons of quality, and honourable, seated in dignity,
and place of authority:[o] and there is a seuere constitution made by [p]Charles the fift in
late dayes against them, that though they shall not haue done, or be conuinced to haue hurt
any, yet because they attempted a thing vnlawfull, and abhominable vnto God, are extraordinarily
to be punished. And concerning this particular, S. Augustin discourseth excellently, worthy
to be read, de ciu. dei. l. 8. c. 19.

    [Footnote o: Anonymus de Mosaicarum & Romanarum legum collatione
    titulo. 15.]

    [Footnote p: Constitutiones criminales Caroli 5^i. à Georgio Ramo
    edita cap. 44. 109. & 177 Such are exempted from all benefit of

    vide illum nam multa erudite scribit, ad propositum nostrum
    pertinentia.]

Thirdly, God willeth those should bee put to death, who by Diabolical and vnlawfull Arts, do
endeuour to helpe or harme others, whether in act they performe the same, or purpose with intention,
conceiuing and thinking they can do it, with ranke Witches must needs be marshalled; and therefore
iustly subiect to deserued punishment.

Fourthly, all Idolaters are to dye by diuine appointment, Deu. 17. 5. But I thinke no mans
forehead is so brasen, that will stand Proctor, and plead guiltlesse for these sort of people,
who deuote themselues wholly to the Diuell, though neuer so closely, and with great and cautelous
secresie: and no doubt God therefore was reuenged of the Templars, and their detestable wickednesse
practised in darknesse and obscurity, who all[q] perished, as it were, in a moment for the
same; of which at the full we may be informed in our owne ancient histories.

    [Footnote q: Anno Domini 1312. whose order began 1123. Thomas
    Walsingham in the life of K. Edward the 2^d, in his English
    history, an in his Hypodigma Neustri[e,].]

Fifthly, they doe solicite others to be of their profession (which is one clause of that contract
made betweene them and the Diuell) and consecrate their childen vnto him: and against this,
there is an especiall caution put in Deuteronomy 13. 6.9.10.

Sixtly, they deserue death as inhumane and barbarous tyrants, for lingringly vt sentiant se
mori, that they may feele how they doe decay by degrees, seek the vtter ouerthrow of those
whom they doe maligne: and as a further appendix to this, oftentimes by the helpe of their
grand teacher, sowe discord betweene husband and wife, sollicite maydens, yea enforce both
them, and married women to vncleane, and vnlawfull lusts, and heerein implore the helpe of
the diuell, to accomplish their malicious designes, which trangression is capitall.

Seuenthly, the exercise of this act or vanity is punishable by death, although it be practised
but onely in sport and ieast, which appeare thus, because God hath seriously forbidden (and
vnder no lesse forfeiture of life it self) to aske counsell of a Soothsayer or Coniurer; if
this then be a crime of such nature, in those, who it may bee heerein thought not to doe euill,
ther is no reason to induce any to thinke that hee will spare the wilfull, and purposed authors
thereof, and Magitians, who worke onely iuggling trickes, and illusions, and fore-tell some
future things, as yet vnknowne vntill they doe so fall out, are not freed from the sentence
condemnatorie, much more then those who willingly, and vpon premeditated malice, murther or
impaire the life and good estate of other, deserue to stand paralell with them. And there can
no reson be yielded of this so sharp a censure, but onely because they haue learned, and accordingly
exercise vnlawfull arts, for whosoeuer endeuoureth to bring that thing to passe, by pretending
naturall meanes, which exceedeth the power of Nature, and is now thereunto enabled eyther by
God, or the ministery of good Angells at his appoyntment, hee must of necessity haue this faculty
communicated by some combination and inter league with the diuell.

Eightly, the Iudge or ciuil Magistrate is bound by vertue of that office, and superioritie
he sustaineth in the common-wealth, to purge and free that place, in, and ouer which he hath
command, of all malefactors, which if he doe neglect, then is a double offender, against the
Law both of Iustice and Charity; for hee is obliged by duety to foresee (so much as in him
lyeth) that the publike state should be secured, which it concerneth to haue offenders punished,
otherwise hee maketh himselfe partner with them in their outrages and offences, and standeth
answerable for those damages sustained by the whole bodie of the people in generall, or vndergone
by any particular of the same, for sparing of the wicked[r] is hurting the good, and hee that
doth not represse and forbid euill (when it is in his power) doth countenance and maintaine it.

    [Footnote r: Pythagoras apud Stobæum.]

Much more might be added, and many examples produced, to manifest, how in all Nations these
odious company of witches, and the like haue euer beene accounted detestable; and for their
impious deedes requited with neuer dying shame, aud vtter confusion, and iustly by law executed;
for among the Romans, Mathematitians,[s] and Magitians by the Decree of the Senate were expelled
out of all Italy: and amongst these Pituanus was throwne downe from the rock Tarpeius, and
crushed apeeces. Martius by the Consuls put to death with the sound of a Trumpet without the
gate Exquilina: Publicia and Licinia women,[t] and seauenty more witches hanged. The [u]speedy
judgement of the Athenians, witnesse of their hatred against these kinde of malefactors, is
much commended, who without any other solemnity of proceeding at the onely accusation of a
Maide, without delay put one Lemnia a witch to death: and it is memorable which Ammianus[x]
Marcellinus hath left in record, that one Hilarius, because hee committed his sonne yong, and
not of mature yeares, to be taught and instructed vnto a Coniurer, was adjudged to die, and
escaping from the hands of the executioner, who had negligently bound him, drawne by force
out of the next church of the Christians to which hee fled as vnto a Sanctuary, and executed.

The end of [y]Varasolo, a famous Inchantresse in Hungarie is dreadfull, who for her sundry
witcheries was cast into prison, and there constrayned through extremity of hunger, to reare
off and eate the flesh of her owne legges and armes, and at the last, impatient of further
delay, there murthered herselfe, and shortned the span of her life.

    [Footnote y: Bonfinius rerum Hungaricarum decadis 2. libr. 2.]

But here I stay my hand, take it from the table, and the rather, because much hath already
beene spoken to this purpose. Wherefore, for conclusion, I shut vp this whole Treatise with
a remarkeable speech of a noble [z]King; Let the streight rigor of law bee inflicted vpon all,
both practisers and partakers with wisards, by putting any confidence in them; for it is vngodly
for man to be remisse and fauourable vnto those whom diuine piety, and our duety to God will
not suffer vnpunished. For what folly were it to forsake the Creator and Giuer of life, and
to follow the author of death? this dishonest fact, vnbeseeming, and vtterly repugnant to the
credite and reputation of a Iudge, be farre from him. Let none countenance that which the Lawes
doe condemne, for all are by the Regall Edicts to bee punished with death, who intermeddle
with such forbidden and vnlawfull Artes.

    acquainted with this Art, doth retract his owne books written of

    iudgement, that all these lewd women (for this title may include
    the whole rabble of this blacke Guard) with Iannes and
    Iambres, and Simon Magus, are to be tormented with endlesse
    paines in eternall fire. Cornelius Agrippa De vanitate
