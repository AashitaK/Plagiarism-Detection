FOREWORD

My sons and daughters have tried to persuade me to remodel these memoirs of my grandfather
into a latter-day romance. But I have thought it wiser to leave them as he wrote them. Albeit
they contain some details not of interest to the general public, to my notion it is such imperfections
as these which lend to them the reality they bear. Certain it is, when reading them, I live
his life over again.

Needless to say, Mr. Richard Carvel never intended them for publication. His first apology
would be for his Scotch, and his only defence is that he was not a Scotchman.

The lively capital which once reflected the wit and fashion of Europe has fallen into decay.
The silent streets no more echo with the rumble of coaches and gay chariots, and grass grows
where busy merchants trod. Stately ball-rooms, where beauty once reigned, are cold and empty
and mildewed, and halls, where laughter rang, are silent. Time was when every wide-throated
chimney poured forth its cloud of smoke, when every andiron held a generous log,--andirons
which are now gone to decorate Mr. Centennial's home in New York or lie with a tag in the window
of some curio shop. The mantel, carved in delicate wreaths, is boarded up, and an unsightly
stove mocks the gilded ceiling. Children romp in that room with the silver door-knobs, where
my master and his lady were wont to sit at cards in silk and brocade, while liveried blacks
entered on tiptoe. No marble Cupids or tall Dianas fill the niches in the staircase, and the
mahogany board, round which has been gathered many a famous toast and wit, is gone from the
dining room.

But Mr. Carvel's town house in Annapolis stands to-day, with its neighbours, a mournful relic
of a glory that is past.

CHAPTER I

LIONEL CARVEL, OF CARVEL HALL

Lionel Carvel, Esq., of Carvel Hall, in the county of Queen Anne, was no inconsiderable man
in his Lordship's province of Maryland, and indeed he was not unknown in the colonial capitals
from Williamsburg to Boston. When his ships arrived out, in May or June, they made a goodly
showing at the wharves, and his captains were ever shrewd men of judgment who sniffed a Frenchman
on the horizon, so that none of the Carvel tobacco ever went, in that way, to gladden a Gallic
heart. Mr. Carvel's acres were both rich and broad, and his house wide for the stranger who
might seek its shelter, as with God's help so it ever shall be. It has yet to be said of the
Carvels that their guests are hurried away, or that one, by reason of his worldly goods or
position, shall be more welcome than another.

I take no shame in the pride with which I write of my grandfather, albeit he took the part
of his Majesty and Parliament against the Colonies. He was no palavering turncoat, like my
Uncle Grafton, to cry "God save the King!" again when an English fleet sailed up the bay. Mr.
Carvel's hand was large and his heart was large, and he was respected and even loved by the
patriots as a man above paltry subterfuge. He was born at Carvel Hall in the year of our Lord
1696, when the house was, I am told, but a small dwelling. It was his father, George Carvel,
my great-grandsire, reared the present house in the year 1720, of brick brought from England
as ballast for the empty ships; he added on, in the years following, the wide wings containing
the ball-room, and the banquet-hall, and the large library at the eastern end, and the offices.
But it was my grandfather who built the great stables and the kennels where he kept his beagles
and his fleeter hounds. He dearly loved the saddle and the chase, and taught me to love them
too. Many the sharp winter day I have followed the fox with him over two counties, and lain
that night, and a week after, forsooth, at the plantation of some kind friend who was only
too glad to receive us. Often, too, have we stood together from early morning until dark night,
waist deep, on the duck points, I with a fowling-piece I was all but too young to carry, and
brought back a hundred red-heads or canvas-backs in our bags. He went with unfailing regularity
to the races at Annapolis or Chestertown or Marlborough, often to see his own horses run, where
the coaches of the gentry were fifty and sixty around the course; where a negro, or a hogshead
of tobacco, or a pipe of Madeira was often staked at a single throw. Those times, my children,
are not ours, and I thought it not strange that Mr. Carvel should delight in a good main between
two cocks, or a bull-baiting, or a breaking of heads at the Chestertown fair, where he went
to show his cattle and fling a guinea into the ring for the winner.

But it must not be thought that Lionel Carvel, your ancestor, was wholly unlettered because
he was a sportsman, though it must be confessed that books occupied him only when the weather
compelled, or when on his back with the gout. At times he would fain have me read to him as
he lay in his great four-post bed with the flowered counterpane, from the Spectator, stopping
me now and anon at some awakened memory of his youth. He never forgave Mr. Addison for killing
stout, old Sir Roger de Coverley, and would never listen to the butler's account of his death.
Mr. Carvel, too, had walked in Gray's Inn Gardens and met adventure at Fox Hall, and seen the
great Marlborough himself. He had a fondness for Mr. Congreve's Comedies, many of which he
had seen acted; and was partial to Mr. Gay's Trivia, which brought him many a recollection.
He would also listen to Pope. But of the more modern poetry I think Mr. Gray's Elegy pleased
him best. He would laugh over Swift's gall and wormwood, and would never be brought by my mother
to acknowledge the defects in the Dean's character. Why? He had once met the Dean in a London
drawing-room, when my grandfather was a young spark at Christ Church, Oxford. He never tired
of relating that interview. The hostess was a very great lady indeed, and actually stood waiting
for a word with his Reverence, whose whim it was rather to talk to the young provincial. He
was a forbidding figure, in his black gown and periwig, so my grandfather said, with a piercing
blue eye and shaggy brow. He made the mighty to come to him, while young Carvel stood between
laughter and fear of the great lady's displeasure.

"I knew of your father," said the Dean, "before he went to the colonies. He had done better
at home, sir. He was a man of parts."

"He has done indifferently well in Maryland, sir," said Mr. Carvel, making his bow.

"He hath gained wealth, forsooth," says the Dean, wrathfully, "and might have had both wealth
and fame had his love for King James not turned his head. I have heard much of the colonies,
and have read that doggerel 'Sot Weed Factor' which tells of the gluttonous life of ease you
lead in your own province. You can have no men of mark from such conditions, Mr. Carvel. Tell
me," he adds contemptuously, "is genius honoured among you?"

"Faith, it is honoured, your Reverence," said my grandfather, "but never encouraged."

This answer so pleased the Dean that he bade Mr. Carvel dine with him next day at Button's
Coffee House, where they drank mulled wine and old sack, for which young Mr. Carvel paid. On
which occasion his Reverence endeavoured to persuade the young man to remain in England, and
even went so far as to promise his influence to obtain him preferment. But Mr. Carvel chose
rather (wisely or not, who can judge?) to come back to Carvel Hall and to the lands of which
he was to be master, and to play the country squire and provincial magnate rather than follow
the varying fortunes of a political party at home. And he was a man much looked up to in the
province before the Revolution, and sat at the council board of his Excellency the Governor,
as his father had done before him, and represented the crown in more matters than one when
the French and savages were upon our frontiers.

Although a lover of good cheer, Mr. Carvel was never intemperate. To the end of his days he
enjoyed his bottle after dinner, nay, could scarce get along without it; and mixed a punch
or a posset as well as any in our colony. He chose a good London-brewed ale or porter, and
his ships brought Madeira from that island by the pipe, and sack from Spain and Portugal, and
red wine from France when there was peace. And puncheons of rum from Jamaica and the Indies
for his people, holding that no gentleman ever drank rum in the raw, though fairly supportable
as punch.

Mr. Carvel's house stands in Marlborough Street, a dreary mansion enough. Praised be Heaven
that those who inherit it are not obliged to live there on the memory of what was in days gone
by. The heavy green shutters are closed; the high steps, though stoutly built, are shaky after
these years of disuse; the host of faithful servants who kept its state are nearly all laid
side by side at Carvel Hall. Harvey and Chess and Scipio are no more. The kitchen, whither
a boyish hunger oft directed my eyes at twilight, shines not with the welcoming gleam of yore.
Chess no longer prepares the dainties which astonished Mr. Carvel's guests, and which he alone
could cook. The coach still stands in the stables where Harvey left it, a lumbering relic of
those lumbering times when methinks there was more of goodwill and less of haste in the world.
The great brass knocker, once resplendent from Scipio's careful hand, no longer fantastically
reflects the guest as he beats his tattoo, and Mr. Peale's portrait of my grandfather is gone
from the dining-room wall, adorning, as you know, our own drawing-room at Calvert House.

I shut my eyes, and there comes to me unbidden that dining-room in Marlborough Street of a
gray winter's afternoon, when I was but a lad. I see my dear grandfather in his wig and silver-laced
waistcoat and his blue velvet coat, seated at the head of the table, and the precise Scipio
has put down the dumb-waiter filled with shining cut-glass at his left hand, and his wine chest
at his right, and with solemn pomp driven his black assistants from the room. Scipio was Mr.
Carvel's butler. He was forbid to light the candles after dinner. As dark grew on, Mr. Carvel
liked the blazing logs for light, and presently sets the decanter on the corner of the table
and draws nearer the fire, his guests following. I recall well how jolly Governor Sharpe, who
was a frequent visitor with us, was wont to display a comely calf in silk stocking; and how
Captain Daniel Clapsaddle would spread his feet with his toes out, and settle his long pipe
between his teeth. And there were besides a host of others who sat at that fire whose names
have passed into Maryland's history,--Whig and Tory alike. And I remember a tall slip of a
lad who sat listening by the deep-recessed windows on the street, which somehow are always
covered in these pictures with a fine rain. Then a coach passes,--a mahogany coach emblazoned
with the Manners's coat of arms, and Mistress Dorothy and her mother within. And my young lady
gives me one of those demure bows which ever set my heart agoing like a smith's hammer of a Monday.

CHAPTER II

SOME MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD

A traveller who has all but gained the last height of the great mist-covered mountain looks
back over the painful crags he has mastered to where a light is shining on the first easy slope.
That light is ever visible, for it is Youth.

After nigh fourscore and ten years of life that Youth is nearer to me now than many things
which befell me later. I recall as yesterday the day Captain Clapsaddle rode to the Hall, his
horse covered with sweat, and the reluctant tidings of Captain Jack Carvel's death on his lips.
And strangely enough that day sticks in my memory as of delight rather than sadness. When my
poor mother had gone up the stairs on my grandfather's arm the strong soldier took me on his
knee, and drawing his pistol from his holster bade me snap the lock, which I was barely able
to do. And he told me wonderful tales of the woods beyond the mountains, and of the painted
men who tracked them; much wilder and fiercer they were than those stray Nanticokes I had seen
from time to time near Carvel Hall. And when at last he would go I clung to him, so he swung
me to the back of his great horse Ronald, and I seized the bridle in my small hands. The noble
beast, like his master, loved a child well, and he cantered off lightly at the captain's whistle,
who cried "bravo" and ran by my side lest I should fall. Lifting me off at length he kissed
me and bade me not to annoy my mother, the tears in his eyes again. And leaping on Ronald was
away for the ferry with never so much as a look behind, leaving me standing in the road.

And from that time I saw more of him and loved him better than any man save my grandfather.
He gave me a pony on my next birthday, and a little hogskin saddle made especially by Master
Wythe, the London saddler in the town, with a silver-mounted bridle. Indeed, rarely did the
captain return from one of his long journeys without something for me and a handsome present
for my mother. Mr. Carvel would have had him make his home with us when we were in town, but
this he would not do. He lodged in Church Street, over against the Coffee House, dining at
that hostelry when not bidden out, or when not with us. He was much sought after. I believe
there was scarce a man of note in any of the colonies not numbered among his friends. 'Twas
said he loved my mother, and could never come to care for any other woman, and he promised
my father in the forests to look after her welfare and mine. This promise, you shall see, he
faithfully kept.

Though you have often heard from my lips the story of my mother, I must for the sake of those
who are to come after you, set it down here as briefly as I may. My grandfather's bark 'Charming
Sally', Captain Stanwix, having set out from Bristol on the 15th of April, 1736, with a fair
wind astern and a full cargo of English goods below, near the Madeiras fell in with foul weather,
which increased as she entered the trades. Captain Stanwix being a prudent man, shortened sail,
knowing the harbour of Funchal to be but a shallow bight in the rock, and worse than the open
sea in a southeaster. The third day he hove the Sally to; being a stout craft and not overladen
she weathered the gale with the loss of a jib, and was about making topsails again when a full-rigged
ship was descried in the offing giving signals of distress. Night was coming on very fast,
and the sea was yet running too high for a boat to live, but the gallant captain furled his
topsails once more to await the morning. It could be seen from her signals that the ship was
living throughout the night, but at dawn she foundered before the Sally's boats could be put
in the water; one of them was ground to pieces on the falls. Out of the ship's company and
passengers they picked up but five souls, four sailors and a little girl of two years or thereabouts.
The men knew nothing more of her than that she had come aboard at Brest with her mother, a
quiet, delicate lady who spoke little with the other passengers. The ship was 'La Favourite
du Roy', bound for the French Indies.

Captain Stanwix's wife, who was a good, motherly person, took charge of the little orphan,
and arriving at Carvel Hall delivered her to my grandfather, who brought her up as his own
daughter. You may be sure the emblem of Catholicism found upon her was destroyed, and she was
baptized straightway by Doctor Hilliard, my grandfather's chaplain, into the Established Church.
Her clothes were of the finest quality, and her little handkerchief had worked into the corner
of it a coronet, with the initials "E de T" beside it. Around her neck was that locket with
the gold chain which I have so often shown you, on one side of which is the miniature of the
young officer in his most Christian Majesty's uniform, and on the other a yellow-faded slip
of paper with these words: "Elle est la mienne, quoiqu'elle ne porte pas mou nom." "She is
mine, although she does not bear my name."

My grandfather wrote to the owners of 'La Favourite du Roy', and likewise directed his English
agent to spare nothing in the search for some clew to the child's identity. All that he found
was that the mother had been entered on the passenger-list as Madame la Farge, of Paris, and
was bound for Martinico. Of the father there was no trace whatever. The name "la Farge" the
agent, Mr. Dix, knew almost to a certainty was assumed, and the coronet on the handkerchief
implied that the child was of noble parentage. The meaning conveyed by the paper in the locket,
which was plainly a clipping from a letter, was such that Mr. Carvel never showed it to my
mother, and would have destroyed it had he not felt that some day it might aid in solving the
mystery. So he kept it in his strongbox, where he thought it safe from prying eyes. But my
Uncle Grafton, ever a deceitful lad, at length discovered the key and read the paper, and afterwards
used the knowledge he thus obtained as a reproach and a taunt against my mother. I cannot even
now write his name without repulsion.

This new member of the household was renamed Elizabeth Carvel, though they called her Bess,
and of a course she was greatly petted and spoiled, and ruled all those about her. As she grew
from childhood to womanhood her beauty became talked about, and afterwards, when Mistress Carvel
went to the Assembly, a dozen young sparks would crowd about the door of her coach, and older
and more serious men lost their heads on her account.

Her devotion to Mr. Carvel was such, however, that she seemed to care but little for the attention
she received, and she continued to grace his board and entertain his company. He fairly worshipped
her. It was his delight to surprise her with presents from England, with rich silks and brocades
for gowns, for he loved to see her bravely dressed. The spinet he gave her, inlaid with ivory,
we have still. And he caused a chariot to be made for her in London, and she had her own horses
and her groom in the Carvel livery.

People said it was but natural that she should fall in love with Captain Jack, my father. He
was the soldier of the family, tall and straight and dashing. He differed from his younger
brother Grafton as day from night. Captain Jack was open and generous, though a little given
to rash enterprise and madcap adventure. He loved my mother from a child. His friend Captain
Clapsaddle loved her too, and likewise Grafton, but it soon became evident that she would marry
Captain Jack or nobody. He was my grandfather's favourite, and though Mr. Carvel had wished
him more serious, his joy when Bess blushingly told him the news was a pleasure to see. And
Grafton turned to revenge; he went to Mr. Carvel with the paper he had taken from the strong-box
and claimed that my mother was of spurious birth and not fit to marry a Carvel. He afterwards
spread the story secretly among the friends of the family. By good fortune little harm arose
therefrom, since all who knew my mother loved her, and were willing to give her credit for
the doubt; many, indeed, thought the story sprang from Grafton's jealousy and hatred. Then
it was that Mr. Carvel gave to Grafton the estate in Kent County and bade him shift for himself,
saying that he washed his hands of a son who had acted such a part.

But Captain Clapsaddle came to the wedding in the long drawing-room at the Hall and stood by
Captain Jack when he was married, and kissed the bride heartily. And my mother cried about
this afterwards, and said that it grieved her sorely that she should have given pain to such
a noble man.

After the blow which left her a widow, she continued to keep Mr. Carvel's home. I recall her
well, chiefly as a sad and beautiful woman, stately save when she kissed me with passion and
said that I bore my father's look. She drooped like the flower she was, and one spring day
my grandfather led me to receive her blessing and to be folded for the last time in those dear
arms. With a smile on her lips she rose to heaven to meet my father. And she lies buried with
the rest of the Carvels at the Hall, next to the brave captain, her husband.

And so I grew up with my grandfather, spending the winters in town and the long summers on
the Eastern Shore. I loved the country best, and the old house with its hundred feet of front
standing on the gentle slope rising from the river's mouth, the green vines Mr. Carvel had
fetched from England all but hiding the brick, and climbing to the angled roof; and the velvet
green lawn of silvery grass brought from England, descending gently terrace by terrace to the
waterside, where lay our pungies and barges. There was then a tiny pillared porch framing the
front door, for our ancestors never could be got to realize the Maryland climate, and would
rarely build themselves wide verandas suitable to that colony. At Carvel Hall we had, to be
sure, the cool spring house under the willows for sultry days, with its pool dished out for
bathing; and a trellised arbour, and octagonal summer house with seats where my mother was
wont to sit sewing while my grandfather dreamed over his pipe. On the lawn stood the oaks and
walnuts and sycamores which still cast their shade over it, and under them of a summer's evening
Mr. Carvel would have his tea alone; save oftentimes when a barge would come swinging up the
river with ten velvet-capped blacks at the oars, and one of our friendly neighbours--Mr. Lloyd
or Mr. Bordley, or perchance little Mr. Manners --would stop for a long evening with him. They
seldom came without their ladies and children. What romps we youngsters had about the old place
whilst our elders talked their politics.

In childhood the season which delighted me the most was spring. I would count the days until
St. Taminas, which, as you knew, falls on the first of May. And the old custom was for the
young men to deck themselves out as Indian bucks and sweep down on the festivities around the
Maypole on the town green, or at night to surprise the guests at a ball and force the gentlemen
to pay down a shilling, and sometimes a crown apiece, and the host to give them a bowl of punch.
Then came June. My grandfather celebrated his Majesty's birthday in his own jolly fashion,
and I had my own birthday party on the tenth. And on the fifteenth, unless it chanced upon
a Sunday, my grandfather never failed to embark in his pinnace at the Annapolis dock for the
Hall. Once seated in the stern between Mr. Carvel's knees, what rapture when at last we shot
out into the blue waters of the bay and I thought of the long summer of joy before me. Scipio
was generalissimo of these arrangements, and was always at the dock punctually at ten to hand
my grandfather in, a ceremony in which he took great pride, and to look his disapproval should
we be late. As he turned over the key of the town house he would walk away with a stern dignity
to marshal the other servants in the horse-boat.

One fifteenth of June two children sat with bated breath in the pinnace, --Dorothy Manners
and myself. Mistress Dolly was then as mischievous a little baggage as ever she proved afterwards.
She was coming to pass a week at the Hall, her parents, whose place was next to ours, having
gone to Philadelphia on a visit. We rounded Kent Island, which lay green and beautiful in the
flashing waters, and at length caught sight of the old windmill, with its great arms majestically
turning, and the cupola of Carvel House shining white among the trees; and of the upper spars
of the shipping, with sails neatly furled, lying at the long wharves, where the English wares
Mr. Carvel had commanded for the return trips were unloading. Scarce was the pinnace brought
into the wind before I had leaped ashore and greeted with a shout the Hall servants drawn up
in a line on the green, grinning a welcome. Dorothy and I scampered over the grass and into
the cool, wide house, resting awhile on the easy sloping steps within, hand in hand. And then
away for that grand tour of inspection we had been so long planning together. How well I recall
that sunny afternoon, when the shadows of the great oaks were just beginning to lengthen. Through
the greenhouses we marched, monarchs of all we surveyed, old Porphery, the gardener, presenting
Mistress Dolly with a crown of orange blossoms, for which she thanked him with a pretty courtesy
her governess had taught her. Were we not king and queen returned to our summer palace? And
Spot and Silver and Song and Knipe, the wolf-hound, were our train, though not as decorous
as rigid etiquette demanded, since they were forever running after the butterflies. On we went
through the stiff, box-bordered walks of the garden, past the weather-beaten sundial and the
spinning-house and the smoke-house to the stables. Here old Harvey, who had taught me to ride
Captain Daniel's pony, is equerry, and young Harvey our personal attendant; old Harvey smiles
as we go in and out of the stalls rubbing the noses of our trusted friends, and gives a gruff
but kindly warning as to Cassandra's heels. He recalls my father at the same age.

Jonas Tree, the carpenter, sits sunning himself on his bench before the shop, but mysteriously
disappears when he sees us, and returns presently with a little ship he has fashioned for me
that winter, all complete with spars and sails, for Jonas was a shipwright on the Severn in
the old country before he came as a king's passenger to the new. Dolly and I are off directly
to the backwaters of the river, where the new boat is launched with due ceremony as the Conqueror,
his Majesty's latest ship-of-the-line. Jonas himself trims her sails, and she sets off right
gallantly across the shallows, heeling to the breeze for all the world like a real man-o'-war.
Then the King would fain cruise at once against the French, but Queen Dorothy must needs go
with him. His Majesty points out that when fighting is to be done, a ship of war is no place
for a woman, whereat her Majesty stamps her little foot and throws her crown of orange blossoms
from her, and starts off for the milk-house in high dudgeon, vowing she will play no more.

And it ends as it ever will end, be the children young or old, for the French pass from his
Majesty's mind and he runs after his consort to implore forgiveness, leaving poor Jonas to
take care of the Conqueror.

How short those summer days? All too short for the girl and boy who had so much to do in them.
The sun rising over the forest often found us peeping through the blinds, and when he sank
into the bay at night we were still running, tired but happy, and begging patient Hester for
half an hour more.

"Lawd, Marse Dick," I can hear her say, "you an' Miss Dolly's been on yo' feet since de dawn.
And so's I, honey."

And so we had. We would spend whole days on the wharves, all bustle and excitement, sometimes
seated on the capstan of the Sprightly Bess or perched in the nettings of the Oriole, of which
ship old Stanwix was now captain. He had grown gray in Mr. Carvel's service, and good Mrs.
Stanwix was long since dead. Often we would mount together on the little horse Captain Daniel
had given me, Dorothy on a pillion behind, to go with my grandfather to inspect the farm. Mr.
Starkie, the overseer, would ride beside us, his fowling-piece slung over his shoulder and
his holster on his hip; a kind man and capable, and unlike Mr. Evans, my Uncle Grafton's overseer,
was seldom known to use his firearms or the rawhide slung across his saddle. The negroes in
their linsey-woolsey jackets and checked trousers would stand among the hills grinning at us
children as we passed; and there was not one of them, nor of the white servants for that matter,
that I could not call by name.

And all this time I was busily wooing Mistress Dolly; but she, little minx, would give me no
satisfaction. I see her standing among the strawberries, her black hair waving in the wind,
and her red lips redder still from the stain. And the sound of her childish voice comes back
to me now after all these years. And this was my first proposal:

"Dorothy, when you grow up and I grow up, you will marry me, and I shall give you all these
strawberries."

"I will marry none but a soldier," says she, "and a great man."

"Then will I be a soldier," I cried, "and greater than the Governor himself." And I believed it.

"Papa says I shall marry an earl," retorts Dorothy, with a toss of her pretty head.

"There are no earls among us," I exclaimed hotly, for even then I had some of that sturdy republican
spirit which prevailed among the younger generation. "Our earls are those who have made their
own way, like my grandfather." For I had lately heard Captain Clapsaddle say this and much
more on the subject. But Dorothy turned up her nose.

"I shall go home when I am eighteen,"--she said, "and I shall meet his Majesty the King."

And to such an argument I found no logical answer.

Mr. Marmaduke Manners and his lady came to fetch Dorothy home. He was a foppish little gentleman
who thought more of the cut of his waistcoat than of the affairs of the province, and would
rather have been bidden to lead the assembly ball than to sit in council with his Excellency
the Governor. My first recollection of him is of contempt. He must needs have his morning punch
just so, and complained whiningly of Scipio if some perchance were spilled on the glass. He
must needs be taken abroad in a chair when it rained. And though in the course of a summer
he was often at Carvel Hall he never tarried long, and came to see Mr. Carvel's guests rather
than Mr. Carvel. He had little in common with my grandfather, whose chief business and pleasure
was to promote industry on his farm. Mr. Marmaduke was wont to rise at noon, and knew not wheat
from barley, or good leaf from bad; his hands he kept like a lady's, rendering them almost
useless by the long lace on the sleeves, and his chief pastime was card-playing. It was but
reasonable therefore, when the troubles with the mother country began, that he chose the King's
side alike from indolence and contempt for things republican.

Of Mrs. Manners I shall say more by and by.

I took a mischievous delight in giving Mr. Manners every annoyance my boyish fancy could conceive.
The evening of his arrival he and Mr. Carvel set out for a stroll about the house, Mr. Marmaduke
mincing his steps, for it had rained that morning. And presently they came upon the windmill
with its long arms moving lazily in the light breeze, near touching the ground as they passed,
for the mill was built in the Dutch fashion. I know not what moved me, but hearing Mr. Manners
carelessly humming a minuet while my grandfather explained the usefulness of the mill, I seized
hold of one of the long arms as it swung by, and before the gentlemen could prevent was carried
slowly upwards. Dorothy screamed, and her father stood stock still with amazement and fear,
Mr. Carvel being the only one who kept his presence of mind. "Hold on tight, Richard!" I heard
him cry. It was dizzy riding, though the motion was not great, and before I had reached the
right angle I regretted my rashness. I caught a glimpse of the Bay with the red sun on it,
and as I turned saw far below me the white figure of Ivie Rawlinson, the Scotch miller, who
had run out. "O haith!" he shouted. "Hand fast, Mr. Richard!"--And so I clung tightly and came
down without much inconvenience, though indifferently glad to feel the ground again.

Mr. Marmaduke, as I expected, was in a great temper, and swore he had not had such a fright
for years. He looked for Mr. Carvel to cane me stoutly: But Ivie laughed heartily, and said:
"I wad yell gang far for anither laddie wi' the spunk, Mr. Manners," and with a sly look at
my grandfather, "Ilka day we hae some sic whigmeleery."

I think Mr. Carvel was not ill pleased with the feat, or with Mr. Marmaduke's way of taking
it. For afterwards I overheard him telling the story to Colonel Lloyd, and both gentlemen laughing
over Mr. Manners's discomfiture.

CHAPTER III

CAUGHT BY THE TIDE

It is a nigh impossible task on the memory to trace those influences by which a lad is led
to form his life's opinions, and for my part I hold that such things are bred into the bone,
and that events only serve to strengthen them. In this way only can I account for my bitterness,
at a very early age, against that King whom my seeming environment should have made me love.
For my grandfather was as stanch a royalist as ever held a cup to majesty's health. And children
are most apt before they can reason for themselves to take the note from those of their elders
who surround them. It is true that many of Mr. Carvel's guests were of the opposite persuasion
from him: Mr. Chase and Mr. Carroll, Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Bordley, and many others, including
our friend Captain Clapsaddle. And these gentlemen were frequently in argument, but political
discussion is Greek to a lad.

Mr. Carvel, as I have said, was most of his life a member of the Council, a man from whom both
Governor Sharpe and Governor Eden were glad to take advice because of his temperate judgment
and deep knowledge of the people of the province. At times, when his Council was scattered,
Governor Sharpe would consult Mr. Carvel alone, and often have I known my grandfather to embark
in haste from the Hall in response to a call from his Excellency.

'Twas in the latter part of August, in the year 1765, made memorable by the Stamp Act, that
I first came in touch with the deep-set feelings of the times then beginning, and I count from
that year the awakening of the sympathy which determined my career. One sultry day I was wading
in the shallows after crabs, when the Governor's messenger came drifting in, all impatience
at the lack of wind. He ran to the house to seek Mr. Carvel, and I after him, with all a boy's
curiosity, as fast as my small legs would carry me. My grandfather hurried out to order his
barge to be got ready at once, so that I knew something important was at hand. At first he
refused me permission to go, but afterwards relented, and about eleven in the morning we pulled
away strongly, the ten blacks bending to the oars as if their lives were at stake.

A wind arose before we sighted Greensbury Point, and I saw a bark sailing in, but thought nothing
of this until Mr. Carvel, who had been silent and preoccupied, called for his glass and swept
her decks. She soon shortened sail, and went so leisurely that presently our light barge drew
alongside, and I perceived Mr. Zachariah Hood, a merchant of the town, returning from London,
hanging over her rail. Mr. Hood was very pale in spite of his sea-voyage; he flung up his cap
at our boat, but Mr. Carvel's salute in return was colder than he looked for. As we came in
view of the dock, a fine rain was setting in, and to my astonishment I beheld such a mass of
people assembled as I had never seen, and scarce standing-room on the wharves. We were to have
gone to the Governor's wharf in the Severn, but my grandfather changed his intention at once.
Many of the crowd greeted him as we drew near them, and, having landed, respectfully made room
for him to pass through. I followed him a-tremble with excitement and delight over such an
unwonted experience. We had barely gone ten paces, however, before Mr. Carvel stopped abreast
of Mr. Claude, mine host of the Coffee House, who cried:

"Hast seen his Majesty's newest representative, Mr. Carvel?"

"Mr. Hood is on board the bark, sir," replied my grandfather. "I take it you mean Mr. Hood."

"Ay, that I do; Mr. Zachariah Hood, come to lick stamps for his brother-colonists."

"After licking his Majesty's boots," says a wag near by, which brings a laugh from those about
us. I remembered that I had heard some talk as to how Mr. Hood had sought and obtained from
King George the office of Stamp Distributor for the province. Now, my grandfather, God rest
him! was as doughty an old gentleman as might well be, and would not listen without protest
to remarks which bordered sedition. He had little fear of things below, and none of a mob.

"My masters," he shouted, with a flourish of his stick, so stoutly that people fell back from
him, "know that ye are met against the law, and endanger the peace of his Lordship's government."

"Good enough, Mr. Carvel," said Claude, who seemed to be the spokesman. "But how if we are
stamped against law and his Lordship's government? How then, sir? Your honour well knows we
have naught against either, and are as peaceful a mob as ever assembled."

This brought on a great laugh, and they shouted from all sides, "How then, Mr. Carvel?" And
my grandfather, perceiving that he would lose dignity by argument, and having done his duty
by a protest, was wisely content with that. They opened wider the lane for him to pass through,
and he made his way, erect and somewhat defiant, to Mr. Pryse's, the coachmaker opposite, holding
me by the hand. The second storey of Pryse's shop had a little balcony standing out in front,
and here we established ourselves, that we might watch what was going forward.

The crowd below grew strangely silent as the bark came nearer and nearer, until Mr. Hood showed
himself on the poop, when there rose a storm of hisses, mingled with shouts of derision. "How
goes it at St. James, Mr. Hood?" and "Have you tasted his Majesty's barley?" And some asked
him if he was come as their member of Parliament. Mr. Hood dropped a bow, though what he said
was drowned. The bark came in prettily enough, men in the crowd even catching her lines and
making them fast to the piles. A gang-plank was thrown over. "Come out, Mr. Hood," they cried;
"we are here to do you honour, and to welcome you home again." There were leather breeches
with staves a-plenty around that plank, and faces that meant no trifling. "McNeir, the rogue,"
exclaimed Mr. Carvel, "and that hulk of a tanner, Brown. And I would know those smith's shoulders
in a thousand." "Right, sir," says Pryse, "and 'twill serve them proper. when the King's troops
come among them for quartering." Pryse being the gentry's patron, shaped his politics according
to the company he was in: he could ill be expected to seize one of his own ash spokes and join
the resistance. Just then I caught a glimpse of Captain Clapsaddle on the skirts of the crowd,
and with him Mr. Swain and some of the dissenting gentry. And my boyish wrath burst forth against
that man smirking and smiling on the decks of the bark, so that I shouted shrilly: "Mr. Hood
will be cudgelled and tarred as he deserves," and shook my little fist at him, so that many
under us laughed and cheered me. Mr. Carvel pushed me back into the window and out of their sight.

The crew of the bark had assembled on the quarterdeck, stout English tars every man of them,
armed with pikes and belaying-pins; and at a word from the mate they rushed in a body over
the plank. Some were thrust off into the water, but so fierce was their onset that others gained
the wharf, laying sharply about them in all directions, but getting full as many knocks as
they gave. For a space there was a very bedlam of cries and broken heads, those behind in the
mob surging forward to reach the scrimmage, forcing their own comrades over the edge. McNeir
had his thigh broken by a pike, and was dragged back after the first rush was over; and the
mate of the bark was near to drowning, being rescued, indeed, by Graham, the tanner. Mr. Hood
stood white in the gangway, dodging a missile now and then, waiting his chance, which never
came. For many of the sailors were captured and carried bodily to the "Rose and Crown" and
the "Three Blue Balls," where they became properly drunk on Jamaica rum; others made good their
escape on board. And at length the bark cast off again, amidst jeers and threats, and one-third
of her crew missing, and drifted slowly back to the roads.

From the dock, after all was quiet, Mr. Carvel stepped into his barge and rowed to the Governor's,
whose house was prettily situated near Hanover Street, with ground running down to the Severn.
His Excellency appeared much relieved to see my grandfather; Mr. Daniel Dulany was with him,
and the three gentlemen at once repaired to the Governor's writing-closet for consultation.

Mr. Carvel's town house being closed, we stopped with his Excellency. There were, indeed, scarce
any of the gentry in town at that season save a few of the Whig persuasion. Excitement ran
very high; farmers flocked in every day from the country round about to take part in the demonstration
against the Act. Mr. Hood's storehouse was burned to the ground. Mr. Hood getting ashore by
stealth, came, however, unmolested to Annapolis and offered at a low price the goods he had
brought out in the bark, thinking thus to propitiate his enemies. This step but inflamed them
the more.

My grandfather having much business to look to, I was left to my own devices, and the devices
of an impetuous lad of twelve are not always such as his elders would choose for him. I was
continually burning with a desire to see what was proceeding in the town, and hearing one day
a great clamour and tolling of bells, I ran out of the Governor's gate and down Northwest Street
to the Circle, where a strange sight met my eyes. A crowd like that I had seen on the dock
had collected there, Mr. Swain and Mr. Hammond and other barristers holding them in check.
Mounted on a one-horse cart was a stuffed figure of the detested Mr. Hood. Mr. Hammond made
a speech, but for the laughter and cheering I could not catch a word of it. I pushed through
the people, as a boy will, diving between legs to get a better view, when I felt a hand upon
my shoulder, bringing me up suddenly. And I recognized Mr. Matthias Tilghman, and with him
was Mr. Samuel Chase.

"Does your grandfather know you are here, lad?" said Mr. Tilghman.

I paused a moment for breath before I answered: "He attended the rally at the dock himself,
sir, and I believe enjoyed it."

Both gentlemen smiled, and Mr. Chase remarked that if all the other party were like Mr. Carvel,
troubles would soon cease. "I mean not Grafton," says he, with a wink at Mr. Tilghman.

"I'll warrant, Richard, your uncle would be but ill pleased to see you in such company."

"Nay, sir," I replied, for I never feared to speak up, "there are you wrong. I think it would
please my uncle mightily."

"The lad hath indifferent penetration," said Mr, Tilghman, laughing, and adding more soberly:
"If you never do worse than this, Richard, Maryland may some day be proud of you."

Mr. Hammond having finished his speech, a paper was placed in the hand of the effigy, and the
crowd bore it shouting and singing to the hill, where Mr. John Shaw, the city carpenter, had
made a gibbet. There nine and thirty lashes were bestowed on the unfortunate image, the people
crying out that this was the Mosaic Law. And I cried as loud as any, though I knew not the
meaning of the words. They hung Mr. Hood to the gibbet and set fire to a tar barrel under him,
and so left him.

The town wore a holiday look that day, and I was loth to go back to the Governor's house. Good
patriots' shops were closed, their owners parading as on Sunday in their best, pausing in knots
at every corner to discuss the affair with which the town simmered. I encountered old Farris,
the clockmaker, in his brown coat besprinkled behind with powder from his queue. "How now,
Master Richard?" says he, merrily. "This is no place for young gentlemen of your persuasion."

Next I came upon young Dr. Courtenay, the wit of the Tuesday Club, of whom I shall have more
to say hereafter. He was taking the air with Mr. James Fotheringay, Will's eldest brother,
but lately back from Oxford and the Temple.

The doctor wore five-pound ruffles and a ten-pound wig, was dressed in cherry silk, and carried
a long, clouded cane. His hat had the latest cock, for he was our macaroni of Annapolis.

"Egad, Richard," he cries, "you are the only other loyalist I have seen abroad to-day."

I remember swelling with indignation at the affront. "I call them Tories, sir," I flashed back,
"and I am none such." "No Tory!" says he, nudging Mr. Fotheringay, who was with him; "I had
as lief believe your grandfather hated King George." I astonished them both by retorting that
Mr. Carvel might think as he pleased, that being every man's right; but that I chose to be
a Whig. "I would tell you as a friend, young man," replied the doctor, "that thy politics are
not over politic." And they left me puzzling, laughing with much relish over some catch in
the doctor's words. As for me, I could perceive no humour in them.

It was now near six of the clock, but instead of going direct to the Governor's I made my way
down Church Street toward the water. Near the dock I saw many people gathered in the street
in front of the "Ship" tavern, a time-honoured resort much patronized by sailors. My curiosity
led me to halt there also. The "Ship" had stood in that place nigh on to three-score years,
it was said. Its latticed windows were swung open, and from within came snatches of "Tom Bowling,"
"Rule Britannia," and many songs scarce fit for a child to hear. Now and anon some one in the
street would throw back a taunt to these British sentiments, which went unheeded. "They be
drunk as lords," said Weld, the butcher's apprentice, "and when they comes out we'll hev more
than one broken head in this street." The songs continuing, he cried again, "Come out, d-n
ye." Weld had had more than his own portion of rum that day. Spying me seated on the gate-post
opposite, he shouted: "So ho, Master Carvel, the streets are not for his Majesty's supporters
to-day." Other artisans who were there bade him leave me in peace, saying that my grandfather
was a good friend of the people. The matter might have ended there had I been older and wiser,
but the excitement of the day had gone to my head like wine. "I am as stout a patriot as you,
Weld," I shouted back, and flushed at the cheering that followed. And Weld ran up to me, and
though I was a good piece of a lad, swung me lightly onto his shoulder. "Harkee, Master Richard,"
he said, "I can get nothing out of the poltroons by shouting. Do you go in and say that Weld
will fight any mother's son of them single-handed."

"For shame, to send a lad into a tavern," said old Bobbins, who had known my grandfather these
many years. But the desire for a row was so great among the rest that they silenced him. Weld
set me down, and I, nothing loth, ran through the open door.

I had never before been in the "Ship," nor, indeed, in any tavern save that of Master Dingley,
near Carvel Hall. The "Ship" was a bare place enough, with low black beams and sanded floor,
and rough tables and chairs set about. On that September evening it was stifling hot; and the
odours from the men, and the spilled rum and tobacco smoke, well-nigh overpowered me. The room
was filled with a motley gang of sailors, mostly from the bark Mr. Hood had come on, and some
from H.M.S. Hawk, then lying in the harbour.

A strapping man-o'-war's-man sat near the door, his jacket thrown open and his great chest
bared, and when he perceived me he was in the act of proposing a catch; 'twas "The Great Bell
o' Lincoln," I believe; and he held a brimming cup of bumbo in his hand. In his surprise he
set it awkwardly down again, thereby spilling full half of it. "Avast," says he, with an oath,
"what's this come among us?" and he looked me over with a comical eye. "A d-d provincial,"
he went on scornfully, "but a gentleman's son, or Jack Ball's a liar." Whereupon his companions
rose from their seats and crowded round me. More than one reeled against me. And though I was
somewhat awed by the strangeness of that dark, ill-smelling room, and by the rough company
in which I found myself, I held my ground, and spoke up as strongly as I might.

"Weld, the butcher's apprentice, bids me say he will fight any man among you single-handed."

"So ho, my little gamecock, my little schooner with a swivel," said he who had called himself
Jack Ball, "and where can this valiant butcher be found?"

"He waits in the street," I answered more boldly.

"Split me fore and aft if he waits long," said Jack, draining the rest of his rum. And picking
me up as easily as did Weld he rushed out of the door, and after him as many of his mates as
could walk or stagger thither.

In the meantime the news had got abroad in the street that the butcher's apprentice was to
fight one of the Hawk's men, and when I emerged from the tavern the crowd had doubled, and
people were running hither in all haste from both directions. But that fight was never to be.
Big Jack Ball had scarce set me down and shouted a loud defiance, shaking his fist at Weld,
who stood out opposite, when a soldierly man on a great horse turned the corner and wheeled
between the combatants. I knew at a glance it was Captain Clapsaddle, and guiltily wished myself
at the Governor's. The townspeople knew him likewise, and many were slinking away even before
he spoke, as his charger stood pawing the ground.

"What's this I hear, you villain," said he to Weld, in his deep, ringing voice, "that you have
not only provoked a row with one of the King's sailors, but have dared send a child into that
tavern with your fool's message?"

Weld was awkward and sullen enough, and no words came to him.

"Your tongue, you sot," the captain went on, drawing his sword in his anger, "is it true you
have made use of a gentleman's son for your low purposes?"

But Weld was still silent, and not a sound came from either side until old Robbins spoke up.

"There are many here can say I warned him, your honour," he said.

"Warned him!" cried the captain. "Mr. Carvel has just given you twenty pounds for your wife,
and you warned him!"

Robbins said no more; and the butcher's apprentice, hanging his head, as well he might before
the captain, I was much moved to pity for him, seeing that my forwardness had in some sense
led him on.

"Twas in truth my fault, captain," I cried out. The captain looked at me, and said nothing.
After that the butcher made bold to take up his man's defence.

"Master Carvel was indeed somewhat to blame, sir," said he, "and Weld is in liquor."

"And I'll have him to pay for his drunkenness," said Captain Clapsaddle, hotly. "Get to your
homes," he cried. "Ye are a lot of idle hounds, who would make liberty the excuse for riot."
He waved his sword at the pack of them, and they scattered like sheep until none but Weld was
left. "And as for you, Weld," he continued, "you'll rue this pretty business, or Daniel Clapsaddle
never punished a cut-throat." And turning to Jack Ball, he bade him lift me to the saddle,
and so I rode with him to the Governor's without a word; for I knew better than to talk when
he was in that mood.

The captain was made to tarry and sup with his Excellency and my grandfather, and I sat perforce
a fourth at the table, scarce daring to conjecture as to the outcome of my escapade. But as
luck would have it, the Governor had been that day in such worry and perplexity, and my grandfather
also, that my absence had passed unnoticed. Nor did my good friend the captain utter a word
to them of what he knew. But afterwards he called me to him and set me upon his knee. How big,
and kind, and strong he was, and how I loved his bluff soldier's face and blunt ways. And when
at last he spoke, his words burnt deep in my memory, so that even now I can repeat them.

"Richard," he said, "I perceive you are like your father. I love your spirit greatly, but you
have been overrash to-day. Remember this, lad, that you are a gentleman, the son of the bravest
and truest gentleman I have ever known, save one; and he is destined to high things." I know
now that he spoke of Colonel Washington. "And that your mother," here his voice trembled,--"your
mother was a lady, every inch of her, and too good for this world. Remember, and seek no company,
therefore, beyond that circle in which you were born. Fear not to be kind and generous, as
I know you ever will be, but choose not intimates from the tavern." Here the captain cleared
his throat, and seemed to seek for words. "I fear there are times coming, my lad," he went
on presently, "when every man must choose his side, and stand arrayed in his own colours. It
is not for me to shape your way of thinking. Decide in your own mind that which is right, and
when you have so decided,"--he drew his sword, as was his habit when greatly moved, and placed
his broad hand upon my head,--"know then that God is with you, and swerve not from thy course
the width of this blade for any man."

We sat upon a little bench in the Governor's garden, in front of us the wide Severn merging
into the bay, and glowing like molten gold in the setting sun. And I was thrilled with a strange
reverence such as I have sometimes since felt in the presence of heroes.

CHAPTER IV

GRAFTON WOULD HEAL AN OLD BREACH

Doctor Hilliard, my grandfather's chaplain, was as holy a man as ever wore a gown, but I can
remember none of his discourses which moved me as much by half as those simple words Captain
Clapsaddle had used. The worthy doctor, who had baptized both my mother and father, died suddenly
at Carvel Hall the spring following, of a cold contracted while visiting a poor man who dwelt
across the river. He would have lacked but three years of fourscore come Whitsuntide. He was
universally loved and respected in that district where he had lived so long and ably, by rich
and poor alike, and those of many creeds saw him to his last resting-place. Mr. Carroll, of
Carrollton, who was an ardent Catholic, stood bareheaded beside the grave.

Doctor Hilliard was indeed a beacon in a time when his profession among us was all but darkness,
and when many of the scandals of the community might be laid at the door of those whose duty
it was to prevent them. The fault lay without doubt in his Lordship's charter, which gave to
the parishioners no voice in the choosing of their pastors. This matter was left to Lord Baltimore's
whim. Hence it was that he sent among us so many fox-hunting and gaming parsons who read the
service ill and preached drowsy and illiterate sermons. Gaming and fox-hunting, did I say?
These are but charitable words to cover the real characters of those impostors in holy orders,
whose doings would often bring the blush of shame to your cheeks. Nay, I have seen a clergyman
drunk in the pulpit, and even in those freer days their laxity and immorality were such that
many flocked to hear the parsons of the Methodists and Lutherans, whose simple and eloquent
words and simpler lives were worthy of their cloth. Small wonder was it, when every strolling
adventurer and soldier out of employment took orders and found favour in his Lordship's eyes,
and were given the fattest livings in place of worthier men, that the Established Church fell
somewhat into disrepute. Far be it from me to say that there were not good men and true in
that Church, but the wag who writ this verse, which became a common saying in Maryland, was
not far wrong for the great body of them:--

       "Who is a monster of the first renown?
        A lettered sot, a drunkard in a gown."

My grandfather did not replace Dr. Hilliard at the Hall, afterwards saying the prayers himself.
The doctor had been my tutor, and in spite of my waywardness and lack of love for the classics
had taught me no little Latin and Greek, and early instilled into my mind those principles
necessary for the soul's salvation. I have often thought with regret on the pranks I played
him. More than once at lesson-time have I gone off with Hugo and young Harvey for a rabbit
hunt, stealing two dogs from the pack, and thus committing a double offence. You may be sure
I was well thrashed by Mr. Carvel, who thought the more of the latter misdoing, though obliged
to emphasize the former. The doctor would never raise his hand against me. His study, where
I recited my daily tasks, was that small sunny room on the water side of the east wing; and
I well recall him as he sat behind his desk of a morning after prayers, his horn spectacles
perched on his high nose and his quill over his ear, and his ink-powder and pewter stand beside
him. His face would grow more serious as I scanned my Virgil in a faltering voice, and as he
descanted on a passage my eye would wander out over the green trees and fields to the glistening
water. What cared I for "Arma virumque" at such a time? I was watching Nebo a-fishing beyond
the point, and as he waded ashore the burden on his shoulders had a much keener interest for
me than that AEneas carried out of Troy.

My Uncle Grafton came to Dr. Hilliard's funeral, choosing this opportunity to become reconciled
to my grandfather, who he feared had not much longer to live. Albeit Mr. Carvel was as stout
and hale as ever. None of the mourners at the doctor's grave showed more sorrow than did Grafton.
A thousand remembrances of the good old man returned to him, and I heard him telling Mr. Carroll
and some other gentlemen, with much emotion, how he had loved his reverend preceptor, from
whom he had learned nothing but what was good. "How fortunate are you, Richard," he once said,
"to have had such a spiritual and intellectual teacher in your youth. Would that Philip might
have learned from such a one. And I trust you can say, my lad, that you have made the best
of your advantages, though I fear you are of a wild nature, as your father was before you."
And my uncle sighed and crossed his hands behind his back. "'Tis perhaps better that poor John
is in his grave," he said. Grafton had a word and a smile for every one about the old place,
but little else, being, as he said, but a younger son and a poor man. I was near to forgetting
the shilling he gave Scipio. 'Twas not so unostentatiously done but that Mr. Carvel and I marked
it. And afterwards I made Scipio give me the coin, replacing it with another, and flung it
as far into the river as ever I could throw.

As was but proper to show his sorrow at the death of the old chaplain he had loved so much,
Grafton came to the Hall drest entirely in black. He would have had his lady and Philip, a
lad near my own age, clad likewise in sombre colours. But my Aunt Caroline would none of them,
holding it to be the right of her sex to dress as became its charms. Her silks and laces went
but ill with the low estate my uncle claimed for his purse, and Master Philip's wardrobe was
twice the size of mine. And the family travelled in a coach as grand as Mr. Carvel's own, with
panels wreathed in flowers and a footman and outrider in livery, from which my aunt descended
like a duchess. She embraced my grandfather with much warmth, and kissed me effusively on both
cheeks.

"And this is dear Richard?" she cried. "Philip, come at once and greet your cousin. He has
not the look of the Carvels," she continued volubly, "but more resembles his mother, as I recall
her."

"Indeed, madam," my grandfather answered somewhat testily, "he has the Carvel nose and mouth,
though his chin is more pronounced. He has Elizabeth's eyes."

But my aunt was a woman who flew from one subject to another, and she had already ceased to
think of me. She was in the hall. "The dear old home?" she cries, though she had been in it
but once before, regarding lovingly each object as her eye rested upon it, nay, caressingly
when she came to the great punch-bowl and the carved mahogany dresser, and the Peter Lely over
the broad fireplace. "What memories they must bring to your mind, my dear," she remarks to
her husband. "'Tis cruel, as I once said to dear papa, that we cannot always live under the
old rafters we loved so well as children." And the good lady brushes away a tear with her embroidered
pocket-napkin. Tears that will come in spite of us all. But she brightens instantly and smiles
at the line of servants drawn up to welcome them. "This is Scipio, my son, who was with your
grandfather when your father was born, and before." Master Philip nods graciously in response
to Scipio's delighted bow. "And Harvey," my aunt rattles on. "Have you any new mares to surprise
us with this year, Harvey?" Harvey not being as overcome with Mrs. Grafton's condescension
as was proper, she turns again to Mr. Carvel.

"Ah, father, I see you are in sore need of a woman's hand about the old house. What a difference
a touch makes, to be sure." And she takes off her gloves and attacks the morning room, setting
an ornament here and another there, and drawing back for the effect. "Such a bachelor's hall
as you are keeping!"

"We still have Willis, Caroline," remonstrates my grandfather, gravely. "I have no fault to
find with her housekeeping."

"Of course not, father; men never notice," Aunt Caroline replies in an aggrieved tone. And
when Willis herself comes in, auguring no good from this visit, my aunt gives her the tips
of her fingers. And I imagine I see a spark fly between them.

As for Grafton, he was more than willing to let bygones be bygones between his father and himself.
Aunt Caroline said with feeling that Dr. Hilliard's death was a blessing, after all, since
it brought a long-separated father and son together once more. Grafton had been misjudged and
ill-used, and he called Heaven to witness that the quarrel had never been of his seeking,--a
statement which Mr. Carvel was at no pains to prove perjury. How attentive was Mr. Grafton
to his father's every want. He read his Gazette to him of a Thursday, though the old gentleman's
eyes are as good as ever. If Mr. Carvel walks out of an evening, Grafton's arm is ever ready,
and my uncle and his worthy lady are eager to take a hand at cards before supper. "Philip,
my dear," says my aunt, "thy grandfather's slippers," or, "Philip, my love, thy grandfather's
hat and cane." But it is plain that Master Philip has not been brought up to wait on his elders.
He is curled with a novel in his grandfather's easy chair by the window. "There is Dio, mamma,
who has naught to do but serve grandpapa," says he, and gives a pull at the cord over his head
which rings the bell about the servants' ears in the hall below. And Dio, the whites of his
eyes showing, comes running into the room.

"It is nothing, Diomedes," says Mr. Carvel. "Master Philip will fetch what I need.". Master
Philip's papa and mamma stare at each other in a surprise mingled with no little alarm, Master
Philip being to all appearances intent upon his book.

"Philip," says my grandfather, gently. I had more than once heard him speak thus, and well
knew what was coming.

"Sir," replies my cousin, without looking up. "Follow me, sir," said Mr. Carvel, in a voice
so different that Philip drops his book. They went up the stairs together, and what occurred
there I leave to the imagination. But when next Philip was bidden to do an errand for Mr. Carvel
my grandfather said quietly: "I prefer that Richard should go, Caroline." And though my aunt
and uncle, much mortified, begged him to give Philip another chance, he would never permit it.

Nevertheless, a great effort was made to restore Philip to his grandfather's good graces. At
breakfast one morning, after my aunt had poured Mr. Carvel's tea and made her customary compliment
to the blue and gold breakfast china, my Uncle Grafton spoke up.

"Now that Dr. Hilliard is gone, father, what do you purpose concerning Richard's schooling?"

"He shall go to King William's school in the autumn," Mr. Carvel replied.

"In the autumn!" cried my uncle. "I do not give Philip even the short holiday of this visit.
He has his Greek and his Virgil every day."

"And can repeat the best passages," my aunt chimes in. "Philip, my dear, recite that one your
father so delights in."

However unwilling Master Philip had been to disturb himself for errands, he was nothing loth
to show his knowledge, and recited glibly enough several lines of his Virgil verbatim; thereby
pleasing his fond parents greatly and my grandfather not a little.

"I will add a crown to your savings, Philip," says his father.

"And here is a pistole to spend as you will," says Mr. Carvel, tossing him the piece.

"Nay, father, I do not encourage the lad to be a spendthrift," says Grafton, taking the pistole
himself. "I will place this token of your appreciation in his strong-box. You know we have
a prodigal strain in the family, sir." And my uncle looks at me significantly.

"Let it be as I say, Grafton," persists Mr. Carvel, who liked not to be balked in any matter,
and was not over-pleased at this reference to my father. And he gave Philip forthwith another
pistole, telling his father to add the first to his saving if he would.

"And Richard must have his chance," says my Aunt Caroline, sweetly, as she rises to leave the room.

"Ay, here is a crown for you, Richard," says my uncle, smiling. "Let us hear your Latin, which
should be purer than Philip's."

My grandfather glanced uneasily at me across the table; he saw clearly the trick Grafton had
played me, I think. But for once I was equal to my uncle, and haply remembered a line Dr. Hilliard
had expounded, which fitted the present case marvellously well. With little ceremony I tossed
back the crown, and slowly repeated those words used to warn the Trojans against accepting
the Grecian horse:

        "Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes."

"Egad," cried Mr. Carvel, slapping his knee, "the lad bath beaten you on your own ground, Grafton."
And he laughed as my grandfather only could laugh, until the dishes rattled on the table. But
my uncle thought it no matter for jesting.

Philip was also well versed in politics for a lad of his age, and could discuss glibly the
right of Parliament to tax the colonies. He denounced the seditious doings in Annapolis and
Boston Town with an air of easy familiarity, for Philip had the memory of a parrot, and 'twas
easy to perceive whence his knowledge sprang. But when my fine master spoke disparagingly of
the tradesmen as at the bottom of the trouble, my grandfather's patience came to an end.

"And what think you lies beneath the wealth and power of England, Philip?" he asked.

"Her nobility, sir, and the riches she draws from her colonies," retorts Master Philip, readily
enough.

"Not so," Mr. Carvel said gravely. "She owes her greatness to her merchants, or tradesmen,
as you choose to call them. And commerce must be at the backbone of every great nation. Tradesmen!"
exclaimed my grandfather. "Where would any of us be were it not for trade? We sell our tobacco
and our wheat, and get money in return. And your father makes a deal here and a deal there,
and so gets rich in spite of his pittance."

My Uncle Grafton raised his hand to protest, but Mr. Carvel continued: "I know you, Grafton,
I know you. When a lad it was your habit to lay aside the money I gave you, and so pretend
you had none."

"And 'twas well I learned then to be careful," said my uncle, losing for the instant his control,
"for you loved the spend-thrift best, and I should be but a beggar now without my wisdom."

"I loved not John's carelessness with money, but other qualities in him which you lacked,"
answered Mr. Carvel.

Grafton shot a swift glance at me; and so much of malice and of hatred was conveyed in that
look that with a sense of prophecy I shuddered to think that some day I should have to cope
with such craft. For he detested me threefold, and combined the hate he bore my dead father
and mother with the ill-will he bore me for standing in his way and Philip's with my grandfather's
property. But so deftly could he hide his feelings that he was smiling again instantly. To
see once, however, the white belly of the shark flash on the surface of the blue water is sufficient.

"I beg of you not to jest of me before the lads, father," said Grafton.

"God knows there was little jest in what I said," replied Mr. Carvell soberly, "and I care
not who hears it. Your own son will one day know you well enough, if he does not now. Do not
imagine, because I am old, that I am grown so foolish as to believe that a black sheep can
become white save by dye. And dye will never deceive such as me. And Philip," the shrewd old
gentleman went on, turning to my cousin, "do not let thy father or any other make thee believe
there cannot be two sides to every question. I recognize in your arguments that which smacks
of his tongue, despite what he says of your reading the public prints and of forming your own
opinions. And do not condemn the Whigs, many of whom are worthy men and true, because they
quarrel with what they deem an unjust method of taxation."

Grafton had given many of the old servants cause to remember him. Harvey in particular, who
had come from England early in the century with my grandfather, spoke with bitterness of him.
On the subject of my uncle, the old coachman's taciturnity gave way to torrents of reproach.
"Beware of him as has no use for horses, Master Richard," he would say; for this trait in Grafton
in Harvey's mind lay at the bottom of all others. At my uncle's approach he would retire into
his shell like an oyster, nor could he be got to utter more than a monosyllable in his presence.
Harvey's face would twitch, and his fingers clench of themselves as he touched his cap. And
with my Aunt Caroline he was the same. He vouchsafed but a curt reply to all her questions,
nor did her raptures over the stud soften him in the least. She would come tripping into the
stable yard, daintily holding up her skirts, and crying, "Oh, Harvey, I have heard so much
of Tanglefoot. I must see him before I go." Tanglefoot is led out begrudgingly enough, and
Aunt Caroline goes over his points, missing the greater part of them, and remarking on the
depth of chest, which is nothing notable in Tanglefoot. Harvey winks slyly at me the while,
and never so much as offers a word of correction. "You must take Philip to ride, Richard, my
dear," says my aunt. "His father was never as fond of it as I could have wished. I hold that
every gentleman should ride to hounds."

"Humph!" grunts Harvey, when she is gone to the house,

"Master Philip to hunt, indeed! Foxes to hunt foxes!" And he gives vent to a dry laugh over
his joke, in which I cannot but join. "Horsemen grows. Eh, Master Richard? There was Captain
Jack, who jumped from the cradle into the saddle, and I never once seen a horse get the better
o' him. And that's God's truth." And he smooths out Tanglefoot's mane, adding reflectively,
"And you be just like him. But there was scarce a horse in the stables what wouldn't lay back
his ears at Mr. Grafton, and small blame to 'em, say I. He never dared go near 'em. Oh, Master
Philip comes by it honestly enough. She thinks old Harvey don't know a thoroughbred when he
sees one, sir. But Mrs. Grafton's no thoroughbred; I tell 'ee that, though I'm saying nothing
as to her points, mark ye. I've seen her sort in the old country, and I've seen 'em here, and
it's the same the world over, in Injy and Chiny, too. Fine trappings don't make the horse,
and they don't take thoroughbreds from a grocer's cart. A Philadelphy grocer," sniffs this
old aristocrat. "I'd knowed her father was a grocer had I seen her in Pall Mall with a Royal
Highness, by her gait, I may say. Thy mother was a thoroughbred, Master Richard, and I'll tell
'ee another," he goes on with a chuckle, "Mistress Dorothy Manners is such another; you don't
mistake 'em with their high heads and patreeshan ways, though her father be one of them accidents
as will occur in every stock. She's one to tame, sir, and I don't envy no young gentleman the
task. But this I knows," says Harvey, not heeding my red cheeks, "that Master Philip, with
all his satin small-clothes, will never do it."

Indeed, it was no secret that my Aunt Caroline had been a Miss Flaven, of Philadelphia, though
she would have had the fashion of our province to believe that she belonged to the Governor's
set there; and she spoke in terms of easy familiarity of the first families of her native city,
deceiving no one save herself, poor lady. How fondly do we believe, with the ostrich, that
our body is hidden when our head is tucked under our wing! Not a visitor in Philadelphia but
knew Terence Flaven, Mrs. Grafton Carvel's father, who not many years since sold tea and spices
and soap and glazed teapots over his own counter, and still advertised his cargoes in the public
prints. He was a broad and charitable-minded man enough, and unassuming, but gave way at last
to the pressure brought upon him by his wife and daughter, and bought a mansion in Front Street.
Terence Flaven never could be got to stay there save to sleep, and preferred to spend his time
in his shop, which was grown greatly, chatting with his customers, and bowing the ladies to
their chariots. I need hardly say that this worthy man was on far better terms than his family
with those personages whose society they strove so hard to attain.

At the time of Miss Flaven's marriage to my uncle 'twas a piece of gossip in every month that
he had taken her for her dower, which was not inconsiderable; though to hear Mr. and Mrs. Grafton
talk they knew not whence the next month's provender was to come. They went to live in Kent
County, as I have said, spending some winters in Philadelphia, where Mr. Grafton was thought
to have interests, though it never could be discovered what his investments were. On hearing
of his marriage, which took place shortly before my father's, Mr. Carvel expressed neither
displeasure nor surprise. But he would not hear of my mother's request to settle a portion
upon his younger son.

"He has the Kent estate, Bess," said he, "which is by far too good for him. Never doubt but
that the rogue can feather his own nest far better than can I, as indeed he hath already done.
And by the Lord," cried Mr. Carvel, bringing his fist down upon the card-table where they sat,
"he shall never get another farthing of my money while I live, nor afterwards, if I can help
it! I would rather give it over to Mr. Carroll to found a nunnery."

And so that matter ended, for Mr. Carvel could not be moved from a purpose he had once made.
Nor would he make any advances whatsoever to Grafton, or receive those hints which my uncle
was forever dropping, until at length he begged to be allowed to come to Dr. Hilliard's funeral,
a request my grandfather could not in decency refuse. 'Twas a pathetic letter in truth, and
served its purpose well, though it was not as dust in the old gentleman's eyes. He called me
into his bedroom and told me that my Uncle Grafton was coming at last. And seeing that I said
nothing thereto, he gave me a queer look and bade me treat them as civilly as I knew how. "I
well know thy temper, Richard," said he, "and I fear 'twill bring thee trouble enough in life.
Try to control it, my lad; take an old man's advice and try to control it." He was in one of
his gentler moods, and passed his arm about me, and together we stood looking silently through
the square panes out into the rain, at the ducks paddling in the puddles until the darkness
hid them.

And God knows, lad that I was, I tried to be civil to them. But my tongue rebelled at the very
sight of my uncle ('twas bred into me, I suppose), and his fairest words seemed to me to contain
a hidden sting. Once, when he spoke in his innuendo of my father, I ran from the room to restrain
some act of violence; I know not what I should have done. And Willis found me in the deserted,
study of the doctor, where my hot tears had stained the flowered paper on the wall. She did
her best to calm me, good soul, though she had her own troubles with my Lady Caroline to think
about at the time.

I had one experience with Master Philip before our visitors betook themselves back to Kent,
which, unfortunate as it was, I cannot but relate here. My cousin would enter into none of
those rough amusements in which I passed my time, for fear, I took it, of spoiling his fine
broadcloths or of losing a gold buckle. He never could be got to wrestle, though I challenged
him more than once. And he was a well-built lad, and might, with a little practice, have become
skilled in that sport. He laughed at the homespun I wore about the farm, saying it was no costume
for a gentleman's son, and begged me sneeringly to don leather breeches. He would have none
of the company of those lads with whom I found pleasure, young Harvey, and Willis's son, who
was being trained as Mr. Starkie's assistant. Nor indeed did I disdain to join in a game with
Hugo, who had been given to me, and other negro lads. Philip saw no sport in a wrestle or a
fight between two of the boys from the quarters, and marvelled that I could lower myself to
bet with Harvey the younger. He took not a spark of interest in the gaming cocks we raised
together to compete at the local contests and at the fair, and knew not a gaff from a cockspur.
Being one day at my wits' end to amuse my cousin, I proposed to him a game of quoits on the
green beside the spring-house, and thither we repaired, followed by Hugo, and young Harvey
come to look on. Master Philip, not casting as well as he might, cries out suddenly to Hugo:
"Begone, you black dog! What business have you here watching a game between gentlemen?"

"He is my servant, cousin," I said quietly, "and no dog, if you please. And he is under my
orders, not yours."

But Philip, having scarcely scored a point, was in a rage. "And I'll not have him here," he
shouted, giving poor Hugo a cuff which sent him stumbling over the stake. And turning to me;
continued insolently: "Ever since we came here I have marked your manner toward us, as though
my father had no right in my grandfather's house."

Then could I no longer contain myself. I heard young Harvey laugh, and remark: "'Tis all up
with Master Philip now." But Philip, whatever else he may have been, was no coward, and had
squared off to face me by the time I had run the distance between the stakes. He was heavier
than I, though not so tall; and he parried my first blow and my second, and many more; having
lively work of it, however, for I hit him as often as I was able. To speak truth, I had not
looked for such resistance, and seeing that I could not knock him down, out of hand, I grew
more cool and began to study what I was doing.

"Take off your macaroni coat," said I. "I have no wish to ruin your clothes."

But he only jeered in return: "Take off thy wool-sack." And Hugo, getting to his feet, cried
out to me not to hurt Marse Philip, that he had meant no harm. But this only enraged Philip
the more, and he swore a round oath at Hugo and another at me, and dealt a vicious blow at
my stomach, whereat Harvey called out to him to fight fair. He was more skilful at the science
of boxing than I, though I was the better fighter, having, I am sorry to say, fought but too
often before. And presently, when I had closed one of his eyes, his skill went all to pieces,
and he made a mad rush at me. As he went by I struck him so hard that he fell heavily and lay
motionless.

Young Harvey ran into the spring-house and filled his hat as I bent over my cousin. I unbuttoned
his waistcoat and felt his heart, and rejoiced to find it beating; we poured cold water over
his face and wrists. By then, Hugo, who was badly frightened, had told the news in the house,
and I saw my Aunt Caroline come running over the green as fast as her tight stays would permit,
crying out that I had killed her boy, her dear Philip. And after her came my Uncle Grafton
and my grandfather, with all the servants who had been in hearing. I was near to crying myself
at the thought that I should grieve my grandfather. And my aunt, as she knelt over Philip,
pushed me away, and bade me not touch him. But my cousin opened one of his eyes, and raised
his hand to his head.

"Thank Heaven he is not killed!" exclaims Aunt Caroline, fervently.

"Thank God, indeed!" echoes my uncle, and gives me a look as much as to say that I am not to
be thanked for it. "I have often warned you, sir," he says to Mr. Carvel, "that we do not inherit
from stocks and stones. And so much has come of our charity."

I knew, lad that I was; that he spoke of my mother; and my blood boiled within me.

"Have a care, sir, with your veiled insults," I cried, "or I will serve you as I have served
your son."

Grafton threw up his hands.

"What have we harboured, father?" says he. But Mr. Carvel seized him by the shoulder. "Peace,
Grafton, before the servants," he said, "and cease thy crying, Caroline. The lad is not hurt."
And being a tall man, six feet in his stockings, and strong despite his age, he raised Philip
from the grass, and sternly bade him walk to the house, which he did, leaning on his mother's
arm. "As for you, Richard," my grandfather went on, "you will go into my study."

Into his study I went, where presently he came also, and I told him the affair in as few words
as I might. And he, knowing my hatred of falsehood, questioned me not at all, but paced to
and fro, I following him with my eyes, and truly sorry that I had given him pain. And finally
he dismissed me, bidding me make it up with my cousin, which I was nothing loth to do. What
he said to Philip and his father I know not. That evening we shook hands, though Philip's face
was much swollen, and my uncle smiled, and was even pleasanter than before, saying that boys
would be boys. But I think my Aunt Caroline could never wholly hide the malice she bore me
for what I had done that day.

When at last the visitors were gone, every face on the plantation wore a brighter look. Harvey
said: "God bless their backs, which is the only part I ever care to see of their honours."
And Willis gave us a supper fit for a king. Mr. Lloyd and his lady were with us, and Mr. Carvel
told his old stories of the time of the First George, many of which I can even now repeat:
how he and two other collegians fought half a dozen Mohocks in Norfolk Street, and fairly beat
them; and how he discovered by chance a Jacobite refugee in Greenwich, and what came of it;
nor did he forget that oft-told episode with Dean Swift. And these he rehearsed in such merry
spirit and new guise that we scarce recognized them, and Colonel Lloyd so choked with laughter
that more than once he had to be hit between the shoulders.

CHAPTER V

"IF LADIES BE BUT YOUNG AND FAIR"

No boyhood could have been happier than mine, and throughout it, ever present with me, were
a shadow and a light. The shadow was my Uncle Grafton. I know not what strange intuition of
the child made me think of him so constantly after that visit he paid us, but often I would
wake from my sleep with his name upon my lips, and a dread at my heart. The light--need I say?--was
Miss Dorothy Manners. Little Miss Dolly was often at the Hall after that happy week we spent
together; and her home, Wilmot House, was scarce three miles across wood and field by our plantation
roads. I was a stout little fellow enough, and before I was twelve I had learned to follow
to hounds my grandfather's guests on my pony; and Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Carvel when they shot on
the duck points. Ay, and what may surprise you, my dears, I was given a weak little toddy off
the noggin at night, while the gentlemen stretched their limbs before the fire, or played at
whist or loo Mr. Carvel would have no milksop, so he said. But he early impressed upon me that
moderation was the mark of a true man, even as excess was that of a weak one.

And so it was no wonder that I frequently found my way to Wilmot House alone. There I often
stayed the whole day long, romping with Dolly at games of our own invention, and many the time
I was sent home after dark by Mrs. Manners with Jim, the groom. About once in the week Mr.
and Mrs. Manners would bring Dorothy over for dinner or tea at the Hall. She grew quickly--so
quickly that I scarce realized--into a tall slip of a girl, who could be wilful and cruel,
laughing or forgiving, shy or impudent, in a breath. She had as many moods as the sea. I have
heard her entertain Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Bordley and the ladies, and my grandfather, by the hour,
while I sat by silent and miserable, but proud of her all the same. Boylike, I had grown to
think of her as my possession, tho' she gave me no reason whatever. I believe I had held my
hand over fire for her, at a word. And, indeed, I did many of her biddings to make me wonder,
now, that I was not killed. It used to please her, Ivie too, to see me go the round of the
windmill, tho' she would cry out after I left the ground. And once, when it was turning faster
than common and Ivie not there to prevent, I near lost my hold at the top, and was thrown at
the bottom with such force that I lay stunned for a full minute. I opened my eyes to find her
bending over me with such a look of fright and remorse upon her face as I shall never forget.
Again, walking out on the bowsprit of the 'Oriole' while she stood watching me from the dock,
I lost my balance and fell into the water. On another occasion I fought Will Fotheringay, whose
parents had come for a visit, because he dared say he would marry her.

"She is to marry an earl," I cried, tho' I had thrashed another lad for saying so. "Mr. Manners
is to take her home when she is grown, to marry her to an earl."

"At least she will not marry you, Master Richard," sneered Will. And then I hit him.

Indeed, even at that early day the girl's beauty was enough to make her talked about. And that
foolish little fop, her father, had more than once declared before a company in our dining
room that it was high time another title came into his family, and that he meant to take Dolly
abroad when she was sixteen. Lad that I was, I would mark with pain the blush on Mrs. Manners's
cheek, and clinch my fists as she tried to pass this off as a joke of her husband's. But Dolly,
who sat next me at a side table, would make a wry little face at my angry one.

"You shall call me 'my lady,' Richard. And sometimes, if you are good, you shall ride inside
my coroneted coach when you come home."

Ah, that was the worst of it! The vixen was conscious of her beauty. But her airs were so natural
that young and old bowed before her. Nothing but worship had she had from the cradle. I would
that Mr. Peale had painted her in her girlhood as a type of our Maryland lady of quality. Harvey
was right when he called her a thoroughbred. Her nose was of patrician straightness, and the
curves of her mouth came from generations of proud ancestors. And she had blue eyes to conquer
and subdue; with long lashes to hide them under when she chose, and black hair with blue gloss
upon it in the slanting lights. I believe I loved her best in the riding-habit that was the
colour of the red holly in our Maryland woods. At Christmas-tide, when we came to the eastern
shore, we would gallop together through miles of country, the farmers and servants tipping
and staring after her as she laid her silver-handled whip upon her pony. She knew not the meaning
of fear, and would take a fence or a ditch that a man might pause at. And so I fell into the
habit of leading her the easy way round, for dread that she would be hurt.

How those Christmas times of childhood come sweeping back on my memory! Often, and without
warning, my grandfather would say to me: "Richard, we shall celebrate at the Hall this year."
And it rarely turned out that arrangements had not been made with the Lloyds and the Bordleys
and the Manners, and other neighbours, to go to the country for the holidays. I have no occasion
in these pages to mention my intimacy with the sons and daughters of those good friends of
the Carvels', Colonel Lloyd and Mr. Bordley. Some of them are dead now, and the rest can thank
God and look back upon worthy and useful lives. And if any of these, my old playmates, could
read this manuscript, perchance they might feel a tingle of recollection of Children's Day,
when Maryland was a province. We rarely had snow; sometimes a crust upon the ground that was
melted into paste by the noonday sun, but more frequently, so it seems to me, a foggy, drizzly
Christmas, with the fires crackling in saloon and lady's chamber. And when my grandfather and
the ladies and gentlemen, his guests, came down the curving stairs, there were the broadly
smiling servants drawn up in the wide hall,--all who could gather there,--and the rest on the
lawn outside, to wish "Merry Chris'mas" to "de quality." The redemptioners in front, headed
by Ivie and Jonas Tree, tho' they had long served their terms, and with them old Harvey and
his son; next the house blacks and the outside liveries, and then the oldest slaves from the
quarters. This line reached the door, which Scipio would throw open at "de quality's" appearance,
disclosing the rest of the field servants, in bright-coloured gowns, and the little negroes
on the green. Then Mr. Carvel would make them a little speech of thanks and of good-will, and
white-haired Johnson of the senior quarters, who had been with my great-grandfather, would
start the carol in a quaver. How clear and sweet the melody of those negro voices comes back
to me through the generations! And the picture of the hall, loaded with holly and mistletoe
even to the great arch that spanned it, with the generous bowls of egg-nog and punch on the
mahogany by the wall! And the ladies our guests, in cap and apron, joining in the swelling
hymn; ay, and the men, too. And then, after the breakfast of sweet ham and venison, and hot
bread and sausage, made under Mrs. Willis, and tea and coffee and chocolate steaming in the
silver, and ale for the gentlemen if they preferred, came the prayers and more carols in the
big drawing-room. And then music in the big house, or perhaps a ride afield to greet the neighbours,
and fiddling and dancing in the two big quarters, Hank's and Johnson's, when the tables were
cleared after the bountiful feast Mr. Carvel was wont to give them. There was no stint, my
dears,--naught but good cheer and praising God in sheer happiness at Carvel Hall.

At night there was always a ball, sometimes at Wilmot House, sometimes at Colonel Lloyd's or
Mr. Bordley's, and sometimes at Carvel Hall, for my grandfather dearly loved the company of
the young. He himself would lead off the minuet,--save when once or twice his Excellency Governor
Sharpe chanced to be present,--and would draw his sword with the young gallants that the ladies
might pass under. And I have seen him join merrily in the country dances too, to the clapping
of hands of the company. That was before Dolly and I were let upon the floor. We sat with the
other children, our mammies at our sides, in the narrow gallery with the tiny rail that ran
around the ball-room, where the sweet odour of the green myrtleberry candles mixed with that
of the powder and perfume of the dancers. And when the beauty of the evening was led out, Dolly
would lean over the rail, and pout and smile by turns. The mischievous little baggage could
hardly wait for the conquering years to come.

They came soon enough, alack! The season Dorothy was fourteen, we had a ball at the Hall the
last day of the year. When she was that age she had near arrived at her growth, and was full
as tall as many young ladies of twenty. I had cantered with her that morning from Wilmot House
to Mr. Lloyd's, and thence to Carvel Hall, where she was to stay to dinner. The sun was shining
warmly, and after young Harvey had taken our horses we strayed through the house, where the
servants were busy decorating, and out into my grandfather's old English flower garden, and
took the seat by the sundial. I remember that it gave no shadow. We sat silent for a while,
Dorothy toying with old Knipe, lying at our feet, and humming gayly the burden of a minuet.
She had been flighty on the ride, with scarce a word to say to me, for the prospect of the
dance had gone to her head.

"Have you a new suit to wear to-night, to see the New Year in, Master Sober?" she asked presently,
looking up. "I am to wear a brocade that came out this autumn from London, and papa says I
look like a duchess when I have my grandmother's pearls."

"Always the ball!" cried I, slapping my boots in a temper. "Is it, then, such a matter of importance?
I am sure you have danced before--at my birthdays in Marlboro' Street and at your own, and
Will Fotheringay's, and I know not how many others."

"Of course," replies Dolly, sweetly; "but never with a real man. Boys like you and Will and
the Lloyds do not count. Dr. Courtenay is at Wilmot House, and is coming to-night; and he has
asked me out. Think of it, Richard! Dr. Courtenay!"

"A plague upon him! He is a fop!"

"A fop!" exclaimed Dolly, her humour bettering as mine went down. "Oh, no; you are jealous.
He is more sought after than any gentleman at the assemblies, and Miss Dulany vows his steps
are ravishing. There's for you, my lad! He may not be able to keep pace with you in the chase,
but he has writ the most delicate verses ever printed in Maryland, and no other man in the
colony can turn a compliment with his grace. Shall I tell you more? He sat with me for over
an hour last night, until mamma sent me off to bed, and was very angry at you because I had
engaged to ride with you to-day."

"And I suppose you wish you had stayed with him," I flung back, hotly. "He had spun you a score
of fine speeches and a hundred empty compliments by now."

"He had been better company than you, sir," she laughed provokingly. "I never heard you turn
a compliment in your life, and you are now seventeen. What headway do you expect to make at
the assemblies?"

"None," I answered, rather sadly than otherwise. For she had touched me upon a sore spot. "But
if I cannot win a woman save by compliments," I added, flaring up, "then may I pay a bachelor's
tax!"

My lady drew her whip across my knee.

"You must tell us we are beautiful, Richard," said she, in another tone.

"You have but to look in a pier-glass," I retorted. "And, besides, that is not sufficient.
You will want some rhyming couplet out of a mythology before you are content."

She laughed again.

"Sir," answered she, "but you have wit, if you can but be got angry."

She leaned over the dial's face, and began to draw the Latin numerals with her finger. So arch,
withal, that I forgot my ill-humour.

"If you would but agree to stay angry for a day," she went on, in a low tone, "perhaps--"

"Perhaps?"

"Perhaps you would be better company," said Dorothy. "You would surely be more entertaining."

"Dorothy, I love you," I said.

"To be sure. I know that," she replied. "I think you have said that before."

I admitted it sadly. "But I should be a better husband than Dr. Courtenay."

"La!" cried she; "I am not thinking of husbands. I shall have a good time, sir, I promise you,
before I marry. And then I should never marry you. You are much too rough, and too masterful.
And you would require obedience. I shall never obey any man. You would be too strict a master,
sir. I can see it with your dogs and your servants. And your friends, too. For you thrash any
boy who does not agree with you. I want no rough squire for a husband. And then, you are a
Whig. I could never marry a Whig. You behaved disgracefully at King William's School last year.
Don't deny it!"

"Deny it!" I cried warmly; "I would as soon deny that you are an arrant flirt, Dorothy Manners,
and will be a worse one."

"Yes, I shall have my fling," said the minx. "I shall begin to-night, with you for an audience.
I shall make the doctor look to himself. But there is the dressing-bell." And as we went into
the house, "I believe my mother is a Whig, Richard. All the Brices are."

"And yet you are a Tory?"

"I am a loyalist," says my lady, tossing her head proudly; "and we are one day to kiss her
Majesty's hand, and tell her so. And if I were the Queen," she finished in a flash, "I would
teach you surly gentlemen not to meddle."

And she swept up the stairs so stately, that Scipio was moved to say slyly: "Dem's de kind
of ladies, Marse Richard, I jes dotes t' wait on!"

Of the affair at King William's School I shall tell later.

We had some dozen guests staying at the Hall for the ball. At dinner my grandfather and the
gentlemen twitted her, and laughed heartily at her apt retorts, and even toasted her when she
was gone. The ladies shook their heads and nudged one another, and no doubt each of the mothers
had her notion of what she would do in Mrs. Manners's place. But when my lady came down dressed
for the ball in her pink brocade with the pearls around her neck, fresh from the hands of Nester
and those of her own tremulous mammy, Mr. Carvel must needs go up to her and hold her at arm's
length in admiration, and then kiss her on both her cheeks. Whereat she blushed right prettily.

"Bless me!" says he; "and can this be Richard's little playmate grown? Upon my word, Miss Dolly,
you'll be the belle of the ball. Eh, Lloyd? Bless me, bless me, you must not mind a kiss from
an old man. The young ones may have their turn after a while." He laughed as my grandfather
only could laugh, and turned to me, who had reddened to my forehead. "And so, Richard, she
has outstripped you, fair and square. You are only an awkward lad, and she--why, i' faith,
in two years she'll be beyond my protection. Come, Miss Dolly," says he; "I'll show you the
mistletoe, that you may beware of it."

And he led her off on his arm. "The old year and the new, gentlemen!" he cried merrily, as
he passed the door, with Dolly's mammy and Nester simpering with pride on the landing.

The company arrived in coach and saddle, many having come so far that they were to stay the
night. Young Mr. Beall carried his bride on a pillion behind him, her red riding-cloak flung
over her ball dress. Mr. Bordley and family came in his barge, Mr. Marmaduke and his wife in
coach and four. With them was Dr. Courtenay, arrayed in peach-coloured coat and waistcoat,
with black satin breeches and white silk stockings, and pinchbeck buckles a-sparkle on his
shoes. How I envied him as he descended the stairs, stroking his ruffles and greeting the company
with the indifferent ease that was then the fashion. I fancied I saw his eyes wander among
the ladies, and not marking her he crossed over to where I stood disconsolate before the fireplace.

"Why, Richard, my lad," says he, "you are quite grown since I saw you. And the little girl
that was your playmate,--Miss Dolly, I mean,--has outstripped me, egad. She has become suddenly
une belle demoiselle, like a rose that blooms in a night."

I answered nothing at all. But I had given much to know whether my stolid manner disconcerted
him. Unconsciously I sought the bluff face above the chimney, depicted in all its ruggedness
by the painter of King Charles's day, and contrasted with the bundle of finery at my side.
Dr. Courtenay certainly caught the look. He opened his snuff-box, took a pinch, turned on his
heel, and sauntered off.

"What did you say, Richard?" asked Mr. Lloyd, coming up to me, laughing, for he had seen the
incident.

"I looked merely at the man of Marston Moor, sir, and said nothing."

"Faith, 'twas a better answer than if you had used your tongue, I think," answered my friend.
But he teased me a deal that night when Dolly danced with the doctor, and my grandfather bade
me look to my honours. My young lady flung her head higher than ever, and made a minuet as
well as any dame upon the floor, while I stood very glum at the thought of the prize slipping
from my grasp. Now and then, in the midst of a figure, she would shoot me an arch glance, as
much as to say that her pinions were strong now. But when it came to the country dances my
lady comes up to me ever so prettily and asks the favour.

"Tis a monstrous state, indeed, when I have to beg you for a reel!" says she.

And so was I made happy.

CHAPTER VI

I FIRST SUFFER FOR THE CAUSE

In the eighteenth century the march of public events was much more eagerly followed than now
by men and women of all stations, and even children. Each citizen was ready, nay, forward,
in taking an active part in all political movements, and the children mimicked their elders.
Old William Farris read his news of a morning before he began the mending of his watches, and
by evening had so well digested them that he was primed for discussion with Pryse, of the opposite
persuasion, at the Rose and Crown. Sol Mogg, the sexton of St. Anne's, had his beloved Gazette
in his pocket as he tolled the church bell of a Thursday, and would hold forth on the rights
and liberties of man with the carpenter who mended the steeple. Mrs. Willard could talk of
Grenville and Townshend as knowingly as her husband, the rich factor, and Francie Willard made
many a speech to us younger Sons of Liberty on the steps of King William's School. We younger
sons, indeed, declared bitter war against the mother-country long before our conservative old
province ever dreamed of secession. For Maryland was well pleased with his Lordship's government.

I fear that I got at King William's School learning of a far different sort than pleased my
grandfather. In those days the school stood upon the Stadt House hill near School Street, not
having moved to its present larger quarters. Mr. Isaac Daaken was then Master, and had under
him some eighty scholars. After all these years, Mr. Daaken stands before me a prominent figure
of the past in an ill-fitting suit of snuff colour. How well I recall that schoolroom of a
bright morning, the sun's rays shot hither and thither, and split violet, green, and red by
the bulging glass panes of the windows. And by a strange irony it so chanced that where the
dominie sat--and he moved not the whole morning long save to reach for his birches--the crimson
ray would often rest on the end of his long nose, and the word "rum" be passed tittering along
the benches. For some men are born to the mill, and others to the mitre, and still others to
the sceptre; but Mr. Daaken was born to the birch. His long, lanky legs were made for striding
after culprits, and his arms for caning them. He taught, among other things, the classics,
of course, the English language grammatically, arithmetic in all its branches, book-keeping
in the Italian manner, and the elements of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry with their applications
to surveying and navigation. He also wrote various sorts of hands, fearful and marvellous to
the uninitiated, with which he was wont to decorate my monthly reports to my grandfather. I
can shut my eyes and see now that wonderful hyperbola in the C in Carvel, which, after travelling
around the paper, ended in intricate curves and a flourish which surely must have broken the quill.

The last day of every month would I fetch that scrolled note to Mr. Carvel, and he laid it
beside his plate until dinner was over. And then, as sure as the sun rose that morning, my
flogging would come before it set. This done with, and another promised next month provided
Mr. Daaken wrote no better of me, my grandfather and I renewed our customary footing of love
and companionship.

But Mr. Daaken, unwittingly or designedly, taught other things than those I have mentioned
above. And though I never once heard a word of politics fall from his lips, his school shortly
became known to all good Tories as a nursery of conspiracy and sedition. There are other ways
of teaching besides preaching, and of that which the dominie taught best he spoke not a word.
He was credited, you may well believe, with calumnies against King George, and once my Uncle
Grafton and Mr. Dulany were for clapping him in jail, avowing that he taught treason to the
young. I can account for the tone of King William's School in no other way than to say that
patriotism was in the very atmosphere, and seemed to exude in some mysterious way from Mr.
Daaken's person. And most of us became infected with it.

The dominie lived outside the town, in a lonely little hamlet on the borders of the Spa. At
two of the clock every afternoon he would dive through School Street to the Coffee House, where
the hostler would have his bony mare saddled and waiting. Mr. Daaken by no chance ever entered
the tavern. I recall one bright day in April when I played truant and had the temerity to go
afishing on Spa Creek with Will Fotheringay, the bass being plentiful there. We had royal sport
of it that morning, and two o'clock came and went with never a thought, you may be sure. And
presently I get a pull which bends my English rod near to double, and in my excitement plunge
waist deep into the water, Will crying out directions from the shore, when suddenly the head
of Mr. Daaken's mare is thrust through the bushes, followed by Mr. Daaken himself. Will stood
stock still from fright, and I was for dropping my rod and cutting, when I was arrested by
the dominie calling out:

"Have a care, Master Carvel; have a care, sir. You will lose him. Play him, sir; let him run
a bit."

And down he leaps from his horse and into the water after me, and together we landed a three-pound
bass, thereby drenching his snuff-coloured suit. When the big fish lay shining in the basket,
the dominie smiled grimly at William and me as we stood sheepishly by, and without a word he
drew his clasp knife and cut a stout switch from the willow near, and then and there he gave
us such a thrashing as we remembered for many a day after. And we both had another when we
reached home.

"Mr. Carvel," said Mr. Dulany to my grandfather, "I would strongly counsel you to take Richard
from that school. Pernicious doctrines, sir, are in the air, and like diseases are early caught
by the young. 'Twas but yesterday I saw Richard at the head of a rabble of the sons of riff-raff,
in Green Street, and their treatment of Mr. Fairbrother hath set the whole town by the ears."

What Mr. Dulany had said was true. The lads of Mr. Fairbrother's school being mostly of the
unpopular party, we of King William's had organized our cohorts and led them on to a signal
victory. We fell upon the enemy even as they were emerging from their stronghold, the schoolhouse,
and smote them hip and thigh, with the sheriff of Anne Arundel County a laughing spectator.
Some of the Tories (for such we were pleased to call them) took refuge behind Mr. Fairbrother's
skirts, who shook his cane angrily enough, but without avail. Others of the Tory brood fought
stoutly, calling out: "God save the King!" and "Down with the traitors!" On our side Francie
Willard fell, and Archie Dennison raised a lump on my head the size of a goose egg. But we
fairly beat them, and afterwards must needs attack the Tory dominie himself. He cried out lustily
to the sheriff and spectators, of whom there were many by this time, for help, but got little
but laughter for his effort. Young Lloyd and I, being large lads for our age, fairly pinioned
the screeching master, who cried out that he was being murdered, and keeping his cane for a
trophy, thrust him bodily into his house of learning, turned the great key upon him, and so
left him. He made his escape by a window and sought my grandfather in the Duke of Marlboro'
Street as fast as ever his indignant legs would carry him.

Of his interview with Mr. Carvel I know nothing save that Scipio was requested presently to
show him the door, and conclude therefrom that his language was but ill-chosen. Scipio's patrician
blood was wont to rise in the presence of those whom he deemed outside the pale of good society,
and I fear he ushered Mr. Fairbrother to the street with little of that superior manner he
used to the first families. As for Mr. Daaken, I feel sure he was not ill-pleased at the discomfiture
of his rival, though it cost him five of his scholars.

Our schoolboy battle, though lightly undertaken, was fraught with no inconsiderable consequences
for me. I was duly chided and soundly whipped by my grandfather for the part I had played;
but he was inclined to pass the matter after that, and set it down to the desire for fighting
common to most boyish natures. And he would have gone no farther than this had it not been
that Mr. Green, of the Maryland Gazette, could not refrain from printing the story in his paper.
That gentleman, being a stout Whig, took great delight in pointing out that a grandson of Mr.
Carvel was a ringleader in the affair. The story was indeed laughable enough, and many a barrister's
wig nodded over it at the Coffee House that day. When I came home from school I found Scipio
beside my grandfather's empty seat in the dining-room, and I learned that Mr. Carvel was in
the garden with my Uncle Grafton and the Reverend Bennett Allen, rector of St. Anne's. I well
knew that something out of the common was in the wind to disturb my grandfather's dinner. Into
the garden I went, and under the black walnut tree I beheld Mr. Carvel pacing up and down in
great unrest, his Gazette in his hand, while on the bench sat my uncle and the rector of St.
Anne's. So occupied was each in his own thought that my coming was unperceived; and I paused
in my steps, seized suddenly by an instinctive dread, I know not of what. The fear of Mr. Carvel's
displeasure passed from my mind so that I cared not how soundly he thrashed me, and my heart
filled with a yearning, born of the instant, for that simple and brave old gentleman. For the
lad is nearer to nature than the man, and the animal oft scents a danger the master cannot
see. I read plainly in Mr. Allen's handsome face, flushed red with wine as it ever was, and
in my Uncle Grafton's looks a snare to which I knew my grandfather was blind. I never rightly
understood how it was that Mr. Carvel was deceived in Mr. Allen; perchance the secret lay in
his bold manner and in the appearance of dignity and piety he wore as a cloak when on his guard.
I caught my breath sharply and took my way toward them, resolved to make as brave a front as
I might. It was my uncle, whose ear was ever open, that first heard my footstep and turned upon me.

"Here is Richard, now, father," he said.

I gave him so square a look that he bent his head to the ground. My grandfather stopped in
his pacing and his eye rested upon me, in sorrow rather than in anger, I thought.

"Richard," he began, and paused. For the first time in my life I saw him irresolute. He looked
appealingly at the rector, who rose. Mr. Allen was a man of good height and broad shoulders,
with piercing black eyes, reminding one more of the smallsword than aught else I can think
of. And he spoke solemnly, in a deep voice, as though from the pulpit.

"I fear it is my duty, Richard, to say what Mr. Carvel cannot. It grieves me to tell you, sir,
that young as you are you have been guilty of treason against the King, and of grave offence
against his Lordship's government. I cannot mitigate my words, sir. By your rashness, Richard,
and I pray it is such, you have brought grief to your grandfather in his age, and ridicule
and reproach upon a family whose loyalty has hitherto been unstained."

I scarce waited for him to finish. His pompous words stung me like the lash of a whip, and
I gave no heed to his cloth as I answered:

"If I have grieved my grandfather, sir, I am heartily sorry, and will answer to him for what
I have done. And I would have you know, Mr. Allen, that I am as able as any to care for the
Carvel honour."

I spoke with a vehemence, for the thought carried me beyond myself, that this upstart parson
his Lordship had but a year since sent among us should question our family reputation.

"Remember that Mr. Allen is of the Church, Richard," said my grandfather, severely.

"I fear he has little respect for Church or State, sir," Grafton put in. "You are now reaping
the fruits of your indulgence."

I turned to my grandfather.

"You are my protector, sir," I cried. "And if it please you to tell me what I now stand accused
of, I submit most dutifully to your chastisement."

"Very fair words, indeed, nephew Richard," said my uncle, "and I draw from them that you have
yet to hear of your beating an honest schoolmaster without other provocation than that he was
a loyal servant to the King, and wantonly injuring the children of his school." He drew from
his pocket a copy of that Gazette Mr. Carvel held in his hand, and added ironically: "Here,
then, are news which will doubtless surprise you, sir. And knowing you for a peaceful lad,
never having entertained such heresies as those with which it pleases Mr. Green to credit you,
I dare swear he has drawn on his imagination."

I took the paper in amaze, not knowing why my grandfather, who had ever been so jealous of
others taking me to task, should permit the rector and my uncle to chide me in his presence.
The account was in the main true enough, and made sad sport of Mr. Fairbrother.

"Have I not been caned for this, sir?" said I to my grandfather.

These words seemed to touch Mr. Carvel, and I saw a tear glisten in his eye as he answered:

"You have, Richard, and stoutly. But your uncle and Mr. Allen seem to think that your offence
warrants more than a caning, and to deem that you have been actuated by bad principles rather
than by boyish spirits." He paused to steady his voice, and I realized then for the first time
how sacred he held allegiance to the King. "Tell me, my lad," said he, "tell me, as you love
God and the truth, whether they are right."

For the moment I shrank from speaking, perceiving what a sad blow to Mr. Carvel my words must
be. And then I spoke up boldly, catching the exulting sneer on my Uncle Grafton's face and
the note of triumph reflected in Mr. Allen's.

"I have never deceived you, sir," I said, "and will not now hide from you that I believe the
colonies to have a just cause against his Majesty and Parliament." The words came ready to
my lips: "We are none the less Englishmen because we claim the rights of Englishmen, and, saving
your presence, sir, are as loyal as those who do not. And if these principles be bad," I added
to my uncle, "then should we think with shame upon the Magna Charta."

My grandfather stood astonished at such a speech from me, whom he had thought a lad yet without
a formed knowledge of public affairs. But I was, in fact, supersaturated with that of which
I spoke, and could have given my hearers many able Whig arguments to surprise them had the
season befitted. There was silence for a space after I had finished, and then Mr. Carvel sank
right heavily upon the bench.

"A Carvel against the King!" was all he said.

Had I been alone with him I should have cast myself at his feet, for it hurt me sorely to see
him so. As it was, I held my head high.

"The Carvels ever did what they believed right, sir," I answered. "You would not have me to
go against my conscience?"

To this he replied nothing.

"The evil has been done, as I feared, father," said Grafton, presently; "we must now seek for
the remedy."

"Let me question the lad," Mr. Allen softly interposed. "Tell me, Richard, who has influenced
you to this way of thinking?"

I saw his ruse, and was not to be duped by it.

"Men who have not feared to act bravely against oppression, sir," I said.

"Thank God," exclaimed my uncle, with fervour, "that I have been more careful of Philip's associations,
and that he has not caught in the streets and taverns this noxious creed!"

"There is no danger from Philip; he remembers his family name," said the rector.

"No," quoth Mr. Carvel, bitterly, "there is no danger from Philip. Like his father, he will
ever believe that which best serves him."

Grafton, needless to say, did not pursue such an argument, but rising, remarked that this deplorable
affair had kept him long past his dinner hour, and that his services were as ever at his father's
disposal. He refused to stay, though my grandfather pressed him of course, and with a low bow
of filial respect and duty and a single glance at the rector, my uncle was gone. And then we
walked slowly to the house and into the dining room, Mr. Carvel leading the procession, and
I an unwilling rear, knowing that my fate would be decided between them. I thought Mr. Allen's
grace would never end, and the meal likewise; I ate but little, while the two gentlemen discussed
parish matters. And when at last Scipio had retired, and the rector of St. Anne's sat sipping
the old Madeira, his countenance all gravity, but with a relish he could not hide, my grandfather
spoke up. And though he addressed himself to the guest, I knew full well what he said was meant
for me.

"As you see, sir," said he, "I am sore perplexed and troubled. We Carvels, Mr. Allen, have
ever been stanch to Church and King. My great-grandsire fought at Naseby and Marston Moor for
Charles, and suffered exile in his name. 'Twas love for King James that sent my father hither,
though he swore allegiance to Anne and the First George. I can say with pride that he was no
indifferent servant to either, refusing honours from the Pretender in '15, when he chanced
to be at home. An oath is an oath, sir, and we have yet to be false to ours. And the King,
say I, should, next to God, be loved and loyally served by his subjects. And so I have served
this George, and his grandfather before him, according to the talents which were given me."

"And ably, sir, permit me to say," echoed the rector, heartily. Too heartily, methought. And
he carefully filled his pipe with choice leaf out of Mr. Carvel's inlaid box.

"Be that as it may, I have done my best, as we must all do. Pardon me, sir, for speaking of
myself. But I have brought up this lad from a child, Mr. Allen," said Mr. Carvel, his words
coming slowly, as if each gave him pain, "and have striven to be an example to him in all things.
He has few of those faults which I most fear; God be thanked that he loves the truth, for there
is yet a chance of his correction. A chance, said I?" he cried, his speech coming more rapid,
"nay, he shall be cured! I little thought, fool that I was, that he would get this pox. His
father fought and died for the King; and should trouble come, which God forbid, to know that
Richard stood against his Majesty would kill me."

"And well it might, Mr. Carvel," said the divine. He was for the moment sobered, as weak men
must be in the presence of those of strong convictions. My grandfather had half risen in his
chair, and the lines of his smooth-shaven face deepened visibly with the pain of the feelings
to which he gave utterance. As for me, I was well-nigh swept away by a bigness within me, and
torn between love and duty, between pity and the reason left me, and sadly tried to know whether
my dear parent's life and happiness should be weighed against what I felt to be right. I strove
to speak, but could say nothing.

"He must be removed from the influences," the rector ventured, after a halt.

"That he must indeed," said my grandfather. "Why did I not send him to Eton last fall? But
it is hard, Mr. Allen, to part with the child of our old age. I would take passage and go myself
with him to-morrow were it not for my duties in the Council."

"Eton! I would have sooner, I believe, wrought by the side of any rascally redemptioner in
the iron mines of the Patapsco than have gone to Eton.

"But for the present, sir, I would counsel you to put the lad's studies in the charge of some
able and learned man, that his mind may be turned from the disease which has fed upon it. Some
one whose loyalty is beyond question."

"And who so fit as yourself, Mr. Allen?" returned my grandfather, relief plain in his voice.
"You have his Lordship's friendship and confidence, and never has rector of St. Anne's or of
any other parish brought letters to his Excellency to compare with yours. And so I crave your
help in this time of need."

Mr. Allen showed becoming hesitation.

"I fear you do me greater honour than I deserve, Mr. Carvel," he answered, a strain of the
pomp coming back, "though my gracious patron is disposed to think well of me, and I shall strive
to hold his good opinion. But I have duties of parish and glebe to attend, and Master Philip
Carvel likewise in my charge."

I held my breath for my grandfather's reply. The rector, however, had read him, and well knew
that a show of reluctance would but inflame him the more.

"How now, sir?" he exclaimed. "Surely, as you love the King, you will not refuse me in this
strait."

Mr. Allen rose and grasped him by the hand.

"Nay, sir," said he, "and you put it thus, I cannot refuse you."

The thought of it was too much. I ran to my grandfather crying: "Not Mr. Allen, sir, not Mr.
Allen. Any one else you please,--Mr. Fairbrother even."

The rector drew back haughtily. "It is clear, Mr. Carvel," he said, "that Richard has other
preferences."

"And be damned to them!" shouted my grandfather. "Am I to be ruled by this headstrong boy?
He has beat Mr. Fairbrother, and shall have no skimmed-milk supervision if I can help it."

And so it was settled that I should be tutored by the rector of St. Anne's, and I took my seat
beside my cousin Philip in his study the very next day.

CHAPTER VII

GRAFTON HAS HIS CHANCE

To add to my troubles my grandfather was shortly taken very ill with the first severe sickness
he had ever in his life endured. Dr. Leiden came and went sometimes thrice daily, and for a
week he bore a look so grave as to frighten me. Dr. Evarts arrived by horse from Philadelphia,
and the two physicians held long conversations in the morning room, while I listened at the
door and comprehended not a word of their talk save when they spoke of bleeding. And after
a very few consultations, as is often the way in their profession, they disagreed and quarrelled,
and Dr. Evarts packed himself back to Philadelphia in high dudgeon. Then Mr. Carvel began to mend.

There were many who came regularly to inquire of him, and each afternoon I would see the broad
shoulders and genial face of Governor Sharpe in the gateway, completing his walk by way of
Marlboro' Street. I loved and admired him, for he had been a soldier himself before he came
out to us, and had known and esteemed my father. His Excellency should surely have been knighted
for his services in the French war. Once he spied me at the window and shook his cane pleasantly,
and in he walks to the room where I sat reading of the victories of Blenheim and Malplaquet,
for chronicles of this sort I delighted in.

"Aha, Richard," says he, taking up the book, "'tis plain whither your tastes lead you. Marlboro
was a great general, and as sorry a scoundrel as ever led troops to battle. Truly," says he,
musing, "the Lord often makes queer choice in his instruments for good." And he lowered himself
into the easy chair and crossed his legs, regarding me very comically. "What's this I hear
of your joining the burghers and barristers, and trouncing poor Mr. Fairbrother and his flock,
and crying 'Liberty forever!' in the very ears of the law?" he asks. "His Majesty will have
need of such lads as you, I make no doubt, and should such proceedings come to his ears I would
not give a pipe for your chances."

I could not but laugh, confused as I was, at his Excellency's rally. And this I may say, that
had it pleased Providence to give me dealing with such men of the King's side as he, perchance
my fortunes had been altered.

"And in any good cause, sir," I replied, "I would willingly give my life to his Majesty."

"So," said his Excellency, raising his eyebrows, "I see clearly you are of the rascals. But
a lad must have his fancies, and when your age I was hot for the exiled Prince. I acquired
more sense as I grew older. And better an active mind, say I, than a sluggard partisan."

At this stage of our talk came in my Uncle Grafton, and bowing low to the Governor made apology
that some of the elders of the family had not been there to entertain him. He told his Excellency
that he had never left the house save for necessary business, which was true for once, my uncle
having taken up his abode with us during that week. But now, thanking Heaven and Dr. Leiden
and his own poor effort, he could report his dear father to be out of danger.

Governor Sharpe answered shortly that he had been happy to hear the good news from Scipio.
"Faith," says he, "I was well enough entertained, for I have a liking for this lad, and to
speak truth I saw him here as I came up the walk."

My uncle smiled deprecatingly, and hid any vexation he might have had from this remark.

"I fear that Richard lacks wisdom as yet, your Excellency," said he, "and has many of his father's
headstrong qualities."

"Which you most providentially escaped," his Excellency put in.

Grafton bit his lip. "Necessity makes us all careful, sir," said he.

"Necessity does more than that, Mr. Carvel," returned the Governor, who was something of a
wit; "necessity often makes us fools, if we be not careful. But give me ever a wanton fool
rather than him of necessity's handiwork. And as for the lad," says he, "let him not trouble
you. Such as he, if twisted a little in the growth, come out straight enough in the end."

I think the Governor little knew what wormwood was this to my uncle.

"'Tis heartily to be hoped, sir," he said, "for his folly has brought trouble enough behind
it to those who have his education and his welfare in hand, and I make no doubt is at the bottom
of my father's illness."

At this injustice I could not but cry out, for all the town knew, and my grandfather himself
best of all, that the trouble from which he now suffered sprang from his gout. And yet my heart
was smitten at the thought that I might have hastened or aggravated the attack. The Governor
rose. He seized his stick aggressively and looked sharply at Grafton.

"Nonsense," he exclaimed; "my friend Mr. Carvel is far too wise to be upset by a boyish prank
which deserves no notice save a caning. And that, my lad," he added lightly, "I dare swear
you got with interest." And he called for a glass of the old Madeira when Scipio came with
the tray, and departed with a polite inquiry after my Aunt Caroline's health, and a prophecy
that Mr. Carvel would soon be taking the air again.

There had been high doings indeed in Marlboro' Street that miserable week. My grandfather took
to his bed of a Saturday afternoon, and bade me go down to Mr. Aikman's, the bookseller, and
fetch him the latest books and plays. That night I became so alarmed that I sent Diomedes for
Dr. Leiden, who remained the night through. Sunday was well gone before the news reached York
Street, when my Aunt Caroline came hurrying over in her chair, and my uncle on foot. They brushed
past Scipio at the door, and were pushing up the long flight when they were stopped on the
landing by Dr. Leiden.

"How is my father, sir?" Grafton cried, "and why was I not informed at once of his illness?
I must see him."

"Your vater can see no one, Mr. Carvel," said the doctor, quietly.

"What," says my uncle, "you dare to refuse me?"

"Not so lout, I bray you," says the doctor; "I tare any ting vere life is concerned."

"But I will see him," says Grafton, in a sort of helpless rage, for the doctor's manner baffled
him. "I will see him before he dies, and no man alive shall say me nay."

Then my Aunt Caroline gathered up her skirt, and made shift to pass the doctor.

"I have come to nurse him," said she, imperiously, and, turning to where I stood near, she
added: "Bid a servant fetch from York Street what I shall have need of."

The doctor smiled, but stood firm. He cared little for aught in heaven or earth, did Dr. Leiden,
and nothing whatever for Mr. and Mrs. Grafton Carvel.

"I peg you, matam, do not disturp yourself," said he. "Mr. Carvel is aply attended by an excellent
voman, Mrs. Villis, and he has no neet of you."

"What," cried my aunt; "this is too much, sir, that I am thrust out of my father-in-law's house,
and my place taken by a menial. That woman able!" she fumed, dropping suddenly her cloak of
dignity; "Mr. Carvel's charity is all that keeps her here."

Then my uncle drew himself up. "Dr. Leiden," says he, "kindly oblige me by leaving my father's
house, and consider your services here at an end. And Richard," he goes on to me, "send my
compliments to Dr. Drake, and request him to come at once."

I was stepping forward to say that I would do nothing of the kind, when the doctor stopped
me by a signal, as much as to say that the quarrel was wide enough without me. He stood with
his back against the great arched window flooded with the yellow light of the setting sun,
a little black figure in high relief, with a face of parchment. And he took a pinch of snuff
before he spoke.

"I am here py Mr. Carvel's orters, sir," said he, "and py tose alone vill I leaf."

And this is how the Chippendale piece was broke, which you, my children, and especially Bess,
admire so extravagantly. It stood that day behind the doctor, and my uncle, making a violent
move to get by, struck it, and so it fell with a great crash lengthwise on the landing; and
the wonderful vases Mr. Carroll had given my grandfather rolled down the stairs and lay crushed
at the bottom. Withal he had spoken so quietly, Dr. Leiden possessed a temper drawn from his
Teutonic ancestors. With his little face all puckered, he swore so roundly at my uncle in some
lingo he had got from his father,--High German or Low German,--I know not what, that Grafton
and his wife were glad enough to pick their way amongst the broken bits of glass and china,
to the hall again. Dr. Leiden shook his fist at their retreating persons, saying that the Sabbath
was no day to do murder.

I followed them with the pretence of picking up what was left of the ornaments. What between
anger against the doctor and Mrs. Willis, and fright and chagrin at the fall of the Chippendale
piece, my aunt was in such a state of nervous flurry that she bade the ashy Scipio call her
chairmen, and vowed, in a trembling voice, she would never again enter a house where that low-bred
German was to be found. But my Uncle Grafton was of a different nature. He deemed defeat but
a postponement of the object he wished to gain, and settled himself in the library with a copy
of "Miller on the Distinction of Ranks in Society." He appeared at supper suave as ever, gravely
concerned as to his father's health, which formed the chief topic between us. He gave me to
understand that he would take the green room until the old gentleman was past danger. Not a
word, mind you, of Dr. Leiden, nor did my uncle express a wish to go into the sick-room, from
which even I was forbid. Nay, the next morning he met the doctor in the hall and conversed
with him at some length over the case as though nothing had occurred between them.

While my Uncle Grafton was in the house I had opportunity of marking the intimacy which existed
between him and the rector of St. Anne's. The latter swung each evening the muffled knocker,
and was ushered on tiptoe across the polished floor to the library where my uncle sat in state.
It was often after supper before the rector left, and coming in upon them once I found wine
between them and empty decanters on the board, and they fell silent as I passed the doorway.

Our dear friend Captain Clapsaddle was away when my grandfather fell sick, having been North
for three months or more on some business known to few. 'Twas generally supposed he went to
Massachusetts to confer with the patriots of that colony. Hearing the news as he rode into
town, he came booted and spurred to Marlboro' Street before going to his lodgings. I ran out
to meet him, and he threw his arms about me on the street so that those who were passing smiled,
for all knew the captain. And Harvey, who always came to take the captain's horse, swore that
he was glad to see a friend of the family once again. I told the captain very freely of my
doings, and showed him the clipping from the Gazette, which made him laugh heartily. But a
shade came upon his face when I rehearsed the scene we had with my uncle and Mr. Allen in the
garden.

"What," says he, "Mr. Carvel hath sent you to Mr. Allen on your uncle's advice?"

"No," I answered, "to do my uncle justice, he said not a word to Mr. Carvel about it."

The captain turned the subject. He asked me much concerning the rector and what he taught me,
and appeared but ill-pleased at that I had to tell him. But he left me without so much as a
word of comment or counsel. For it was a principle with Captain Clapsaddle not to influence
in any way the minds of the young, and he would have deemed it unfair to Mr. Carvel had he
attempted to win my sympathies to his. Captain Daniel was the first the old gentleman asked
to see when visitors were permitted him, and you may be sure the faithful soldier was below
stairs waiting for the summons.

I was some three weeks with my new tutor, the rector, before my grandfather's illness, and
went back again as soon as he began to mend. I was not altogether unhappy, owing to a certain
grim pleasure I had in debating with him, which I shall presently relate. There was much to
annoy and anger me, too. My cousin Philip was forever carping and criticising my Greek and
Latin, and it was impossible not to feel his sneer at my back when I construed. He had pat
replies ready to correct me when called upon, and 'twas only out of consideration for Mr. Carvel
that I kept my hands from him when we were dismissed.

I think the rector disliked Philip in his way as much as did I in mine. The Reverend Bennett
Allen, indeed, might have been a very good fellow had Providence placed him in a different
setting; he was one of those whom his Excellency dubbed "fools from necessity." He should have
been born with a fortune, though I can think of none he would not have run through in a year
or so. But nature had given him aristocratic tastes, with no other means toward their gratification
than good looks, convincing ways, and a certain bold, half-defiant manner, which went far with
his Lordship and those like him, who thought Mr. Allen excellent good company. With the rector,
as with too many others, holy orders were but a means to an end. It was a sealed story what
he had been before he came to Governor Sharpe with Baltimore's directions to give him the best
in the colony. But our rakes and wits, and even our solid men, like my grandfather, received
him with open arms. He had ever a tale on his tongue's end tempered to the ear of his listener.

Who had most influenced my way of thinking, Mr. Allen had well demanded. The gentleman was
none other than Mr. Henry Swain, Patty's father. Of her I shall speak later. He was a rising
barrister and man of note among our patriots, and member of the Lower House; a diffident man
in public, with dark, soulful eyes, and a wide, white brow, who had declined a nomination to
the Congress of '65. At his fireside, unknown to my grandfather and to Mr. Allen, I had learned
the true principles of government. Before the House Mr. Swain spoke only under extraordinary
emotion, and then he gained every ear. He had been my friend since childhood, but I never knew
the meaning and the fire of oratory until curiosity brought me to the gallery of the Assembly
chamber in the Stadt House, where the barrister was on his feet at the time. I well remember
the tingle in my chest as I looked and listened. And I went again and again, until the House
sat behind closed doors.

And so, when Mr. Allen brought forth for my benefit those arguments of the King's party which
were deemed their strength, I would confront him with Mr. Swain's logic. He had in me a tough
subject for conversion. I was put to very small pains to rout my instructor out of all his
positions, because indolence, and lack of interest in the question, and contempt for the Americans,
had made him neglect the study of it. And Philip, who entered at first glibly enough at the
rector's side, was soon drawn into depths far beyond him. Many a time was Mr. Allen fain to
laugh at his blunders. I doubt not my cousin had the facts straight enough when he rose from
the breakfast table at home; but by the time he reached the rectory they were shaken up like
so many parts of a puzzle in a bag, and past all straightening.

The rector was especially bitter toward the good people of Boston Town, whom he dubbed Puritan
fanatics. To him Mr. Otis was but a meddling fool, and Mr. Adams a traitor whose head only
remained on his shoulders by grace of the extreme clemency of his Majesty, which Mr. Allen
was at a loss to understand. When beaten in argument, he would laugh out some sneer that would
set my blood simmering. One morning he came in late for the lesson, smelling strongly of wine,
and bade us bring our books out under the fruit trees in the garden. He threw back his gown
and tilted his cap, and lighting his pipe began to speak of that act of Townshend's, passed
but the year before, which afterwards proved the King's folly and England's ruin.

"Principle!" exclaimed my fine clergyman at length, blowing a great whiff among the white blossoms.
"Oons! your Americans worship his Majesty stamped upon a golden coin. And though he saved their
tills from plunder from the French, the miserly rogues are loth to pay for the service."

I rose, and taking a guinea-piece from my pocket, held it up before him.

"They care this much for gold, sir, and less for his Majesty, who cares nothing for them,"
I said. And walking to the well near by, I dropped the piece carelessly into the clear water.
He was beside me before it left my hand, and Philip also, in time to see the yellow coin edging
this way and that toward the bottom. The rector turned to me with a smile of cynical amusement
playing over his features.

"Such a spirit has brought more than one brave fellow to Tyburn, Master Carvel," he said. And
then he added reflectively, "But if there were more like you, we might well have cause for alarm."
