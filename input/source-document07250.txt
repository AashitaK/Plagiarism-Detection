NOTE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

Assistance was given to me while searching for information in regard to Ku Klux Klan, by many
former members of the order, and by their friends and relatives. Of especial value were the
details given to me by Major James R. Crowe, of Sheffield, Alabama; the late Ryland Randolph,
Esq., and his son, Ryland Randolph, Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama; Judge Z.T. Ewing, of Pulaski,
Tennessee; Miss Cora R. Jones, of Birmingham, Alabama, niece of one of the founders of the
Klan; Mr. Lacy H. Wilson, of Bristol, Tennessee, the son of one of the authors of the History
printed within, Major S.A. Cunningham and Mr. A.V. Goodpasture, of Nashville, and Dr. John
A. Wyeth, of New York City.

There is still much that is obscure about Ku Klux Klan and I shall be glad to obtain additional
information in regard to the order, and also to receive notice of mistakes and errors in this
account.

INTRODUCTION.

By WALTER L. FLEMING, Ph. D.,

Professor of History in West Virginia University.

Twenty-one years ago there was privately printed in Nashville, Tennessee, a little book by
J.C. Lester and D.L. Wilson, that purported to be an account, from inside information, of the
great secret order of Reconstruction days, known to the public as Ku Klux Klan. It attracted
little notice then; and since that time it has not been given the attention it deserved as
a historical document.[1] At the time of writing, sectional feeling was still inflamed; the
Northern people were not ready to hear anything favorable about the Ku Klux Klan, which they
considered a band of outlaws and murderers; and the Southern people were not desirous of being
reminded of the dreadful Reconstruction period. Many of the members of the Klan who had been
hunted for their lives, and who were still technically outlawed, were unwilling to make known
their connection with the order and some even considered their oaths still binding. But since
the book was printed, the Prescripts or Constitutions of the order have come to light, and
the ex-members are now generally willing to tell all they know about the organization. As yet,
no other member has written an account of the Klan, though several have been projected, and
Lester and Wilson's History seems likely to remain the only one written altogether from inside
sources.

The authors, Capt. John C. Lester and Rev. D.L. Wilson, were in 1884, when the booklet was
written, residents in Pulaski, Tennessee, where the first Den of the Klan was founded. Major
Lester was one of the six original members of the Pulaski Den or Circle. He made a fine record
as a soldier in the Civil War in the Third Tennessee (Confederate) Infantry, and afterwards
became a lawyer and an official in the Methodist Church, and was a member of the Tennessee
legislature at the time of writing the book. Rev. D.L. Wilson, who put the account into its
present form, was born in 1849, in Augusta County, Virginia. He went to school to Jed Hotchkiss
and was graduated as valedictorian of his class from Washington and Lee University, in 1873,
and a year later from the Union Theological Seminary, near Hampden-Sidney, Virginia. From 1874
to 1880 he was pastor of a Presbyterian church at Broadway, Virginia, and from 1880 to 1902
he served a church in Pulaski, Tennessee. He died in 1902 after a six months' residence in
Bristol, Tennessee, as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. He was not a member of the
Klan, but was acquainted with the founders and with many other former members, and had access
to all the records of the order that had not been destroyed. In addition to information received
from other members, Wilson was assisted by Captain Lester, who furnished most of the facts
used, revised the manuscript and the book was printed with both names on the title page.

As a general account of the Ku Klux movement Lester and Wilson's History leaves something to
be desired. It is colored too much by conditions in Tennessee. No knowledge is shown of other
organizations similar to Ku Klux Klan, when in fact there were several other very important
ones, such as the White Brotherhood, the White League, the Pale Faces, the Constitutional Union
Guards, and one, the Knights of the White Camelia,[2] that was larger than the Klan and covered
a wider territory. Then, too, in an attempt to make a moderate statement that would be generally
accepted, the authors failed to portray clearly the chaotic social, economic and political
conditions that caused the rise of such orders, and in endeavoring to condemn the acts of violence
committed under cloak of the order they went too far in the direction of apologetic explanation.
Consequently, the causes seem somewhat trivial and the results not very important.[3] It would
seem from their account that after a partial success, the movement failed in its attempt to
regulate society, and degenerated into general disorder. This is a superficial conclusion and
is not concurred in by the survivors of the period and those who understand the conditions
of that time. The remnants of such a secret, illegal order were certain to degenerate finally
into violence, but before it reached this stage it had accomplished much good in reducing to
order the social chaos.[4]

In view of the fact that the Lester and Wilson account does not mention names it will be of
interest to examine the personnel of the original Pulaski Circle, out of which the Klan developed.
(See p. 52). There were six young men in the party that first began to meet in the fall and
winter of 1865: (1) Captain John C. Lester, of whom something has been said. (2) Major James
Richard Crowe, now of Sheffield, Alabama, who was a native of Pulaski and was educated at Waterbury
Academy and Giles College. When the Civil War began he was studying law in Marion, Alabama,
and enlisted at once in the Marion Rifles, Company "G," Fourth Alabama Infantry. Later he was
transferred to the 35th Tennessee Infantry. He was in the battles of Manassas, Fort Donelson,
Shiloh, Shelton's Hill, White Farm, Richmond, Perrysville, and others of less importance. Three
times he was severely wounded and twice discharged for disability. He was captured with Sam
Davis and both were tried as spies; Crowe was acquitted and Davis was hanged. He has held high
rank in the Masonic order and has been an official in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. (3)
John Kennedy, the only survivor of the original six except Major Crowe. He was a soldier in
the 3rd Tennessee Infantry during the Civil War, is a Presbyterian, and an honored citizen
of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. (4) Calvin Jones, son of Judge Thomas M. Jones, was a lawyer, and
a member of the Episcopal Church. He was Adjutant of the 32nd Tennessee Infantry during the
Civil War. (5) Richard R. Reed was a lawyer, a Presbyterian, and during the war had served
in the 3rd Tennessee Infantry. (6) Frank O. McCord was editor of the Pulaski Citizen, a Methodist,
and had been a private soldier in the Confederate service. Two others came in at the second
or third meeting--Capt. J.L. Pearcy, later of Nashville, now of Washington, D.C., and James
McCallum.[5] The founders were all of Scotch-Irish descent and most of them were Presbyterians.

In regard to the founding of the Pulaski Circle, Major J.R. Crowe says: "Frank O. McCord was
elected Grand Cyclops, and James R. Crowe, Grand Turk. A committee composed of Richard R. Reed
and Calvin Jones[6] was appointed to select a name for the organization. The Greek for circle
was chosen. We called it Kuklos, which was changed to Ku Klux afterward when the name was proposed
to the Circle. John Kennedy suggested that we add another K, and the order was then called
Ku Klux Klan.... The mysterious lights seen floating about the ruins (See p. 61) presented
a weird and uncanny appearance and filled the superstitious with dread of the place; so we
were never disturbed, and it only required a quaint garb and a few mysterious sounds to convince
the uninitiated that we were spirits from the other world. We were quick to catch on to this
idea and we governed ourselves accordingly.... During our parades or appearances in public
the darkies either hid out or remained close in their houses.... The origin of the order had
no political significance. It was at first purely social and for our amusement. It proved a
great blessing to the entire South and did what the State and Federal officials could not do--it
brought order out of chaos and peace and happiness to our beloved South.... The order was careful
in the admission of members and I have never known of a betrayal of the secrets of the order.
I am proud to say that I never knew of one single act done by the genuine Ku Klux Klan that
I am ashamed of or do not now endorse."

Major Crowe and other members repeatedly mention the fact that the membership of the Klan was
largely of Scotch-Irish descent. This was bound to be the case since in the territory covered
by the Klan proper the great majority of the Scotch-Irish of the South were settled. The Ku
Klux Klan extended from Virginia to Mississippi through the white county section--the Piedmont
and mountain region. It seldom extended into the Black Belt, though it was founded on its borders.
There another similar order--the Knights of the White Camelia--held sway. In the Piedmont region
before the spread of the Klan, there were numerous secret protective societies among the whites,
and these were later absorbed into the Klan. The Klan led a more strenuous existence than the
Black Belt orders. In most of its territory, social conditions were worse than in the black
counties. It is a mistake to consider that in 1865-1870, the whites in the densest black districts
were in the place of greatest danger. There the blacks were usually the best behaved; there
the whites were never divided and never lost their grip on society; there the negro still respected
the white people as beings almost superhuman. But race relations were worse in the white districts
where there was a lower class of whites, some of whom mistreated the negro and others encouraged
him to violence. Here the negro had never had the great respect for all whites that the Black
Belt negro had, and here the whites were somewhat divided among themselves. During the war
the "tories," so called, or those who claimed to be Union sympathizers and the Confederates,
alternately mistreated one another, and the close of the war brought no peace to such communities.
To this region escaped the outlaws, deserters, etc., of both armies during the war, and here
the wreckage of war was worst. Such was the nature of the country where the Klan flourished.
It was a kind of ex-Confederate protest against the doings of the "tories," Unionists and outlaws,
and the negroes banded in the Union League. For several years neither the Federal Government
nor the State Government gave protection to the ex-Confederates of this region, and naturally
secret associations were formed for self-defense. This method of self-defense is as old as
history.[7]

The members of Ku Klux Klan are nowadays inclined to consider that their order comprehended
all that took shape in resistance to the Africanization of society and government during the
Reconstruction period. As one ex-member said: "Nearly all prominent men--ex-Confederates--in
all the Southern states were connected in some way with the Klan." This is true only indirectly.
Nearly all white men, it may be said, took part in the movement now called the "Ku Klux Movement."
But more of them belonged to other organizations than were members of the Klan. The Klan had
the most striking name and it was later applied to the whole movement. The more prominent politicians,
it is said, had no direct connection with any such orders. Such connection would have embarrassed
and hampered them in their work, but most of them were in full sympathy with the objects of
the Ku Klux movement, and profited by its successes. Many of the genuine Unionists later joined
in the movement, and there were some few negro members, I have been told. Some prominent men
were honorary members, so to speak, of the order. They sympathized with its objects, and gave
advice and encouragement, but were not initiated and did not take active part. General John
B. Gordon, of Georgia, and General W.J. Hardee, of Alabama, were such members. The active members
were, as a rule, young men. In this respect the Klan differed from the order of White Camelia,
which discouraged the initiation of very young men.

Some well-known members of the Klan were General John C. Brown, of Pulaski, Tennessee; Captain
John W. Morton, now Secretary of State of Tennessee; Ryland Randolph, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
editor of the Independent Monitor, the official organ of the Klan in Alabama; General N.B.
Forrest and General George W. Gordon, of Memphis, Tennessee; Generals John B. Gordon, A.H.
Colquitt, G.T. Anderson and A.R. Lawton, of Georgia; General W.J. Hardee, of Alabama; Colonel
Joseph Fussell, of Columbia, Tennessee. General Albert Pike, who stood high in the Masonic
order, was the chief judicial officer of the Klan.

General Forrest heard of the order after it began to spread, and after investigation consented
to become its head as Grand Wizard. He was initiated by Captain John W. Morton, who had formerly
been his chief of artillery. Under him the order, which was becoming demoralized, was reorganized.
As soon as it had done its work he disbanded it. An enterprising newspaper reporter interviewed
General Forrest, in 1868, on the subject of Ku Klux Klan and extracted much information;[8]
but when before the Ku Klux Committee of Congress, in 1871, the General would make only general
statements and he evaded some of the interrogatories. To the committee he appeared to be wonderfully
familiar with the principles of the order, but very ignorant as to details. The average member
of Congress, ignorant of Southern conditions, did not understand that the members of the order
considered themselves bound by the supreme oath of the Klan and that other oaths, if in conflict
with it, were not binding. That is, the ex-Confederates under the command of Forrest, Grand
Wizard of the Invisible Empire, were obeying the first law of nature and were bound to reveal
nothing to injure the cause, just as when Confederates under Forrest, Lieutenant-General of
the Confederate Army, they were bound not to reveal military information to the hostile forces.
The government, in their view, had not only failed to protect them, but was being used to oppress
them. Consequently they were disregarding its claim to obedience.

Now that General Forrest's connection with the Klan is known it is amusing to read the testimony
he gave before the Ku Klux Committee of Congress in 1871.[9] Though evading questions aimed
to elicit definite information, yet he was willing to speak of the general conditions that
caused the development of the organization in Tennessee. He stated that it was meant as a defensive
organization among the Southern whites to offset the work of the Union League, which had organized,
armed and drilled the negroes, and had committed numerous outrages on the whites; to protect
ex-Confederates from extermination by Brownlow's "loyal" militia, to prevent the burning by
negroes of gins, mills, dwellings, and villages, which was becoming common; to protect white
women from criminal negro men; in short to make life and property safe and keep the South from
becoming a second San Domingo. He stated that about the time the order arose he was getting
as many as fifty letters a day from his old soldiers who were suffering under the disordered
conditions that followed the war, whose friends and relatives were being murdered, whose wives
and daughters were being insulted, etc. They wanted advice and assistance from him. Not being
able to write himself, on account of a wounded shoulder, he kept a secretary busy answering
such letters. Most of the defensive bodies, Forrest stated, had no names and had no connection
with one another. He admitted that he had belonged to the Pale Faces, and that he fully approved
of the objects of the Klan. A copy of the original Prescript was shown to him and he was able
to say that he had never seen it before. In his day, the Revised and Amended Prescript was
used, which was never discovered by any investigating committee. He maintained that the order
was careful in admitting new members, only sober, mature, discreet gentlemen being allowed
to join. At one time, Forrest estimated, so a newspaper reporter stated, that the Klan had
40,000 members in Tennessee and 550,000 in the entire South. This estimate was probably not
exaggerated if the entire membership of all the orders similar to the Klan be counted in. Forrest
refused to give the names of members. It is likely, from several bits of evidence, that he
had much to do with consolidating the order, giving it a military organization, and making
its work effective.

General John B. Gordon, the most prominent military man, next to Forrest, who was connected
with the Klan, gave a clear account of the conditions in Georgia that led to the organization
of the defensive societies of whites.[10] In Georgia the state of affairs where General Gordon
lived was in some respects unlike conditions in Tennessee. In Tennessee the whites were somewhat
divided among themselves and there were not so many blacks. In Georgia, according to Gordon,
the principal danger was from blacks, incited to hostility and violence by alien whites of
low character. The latter organized the negroes into armed Union Leagues, taught them that
the whites were hostile to all their rights, and that the lands of the whites were to be, or
ought to be, divided among the blacks. Under such influences the negroes who had not made trouble
began to show signs of restlessness; some of them banded together to plunder the whites, and
serious crimes became frequent, especially that of rape, and men were afraid to leave their
families in order to attend to their business. The whites feared a general insurrection of
the blacks, and as Gordon stated, "if the sort of teachings given [to the negroes] in Georgia
had been carried out to its logical results the negroes would have slaughtered whole neighborhoods."
That they did not do so, was, in his opinion, due to the forbearance and self-control of the
whites, and to the natural kindness and good disposition of the negroes and their remembrance
of former pleasant relations with the whites. There was no great danger, as one can see today,
of the negro uprisings, but the whites thought then that there was. The religious frenzy of
the blacks during the year after the war also alarmed the whites. The black troops stationed
in Georgia were frequently guilty of gross outrages against white citizens and were a constant
incitement to violence on the part of their fellow blacks. The carpetbag government pardoned
and turned loose upon society the worst criminals. There was no law for several years. The
whites were subject to arbitrary arrest and trials by drumhead courts-martial; military prisoners
were badly mistreated. In general, society and government were in a condition of anarchy; the
white race was disorganized, and the blacks organized, but not for good purposes.

General Gordon spoke of another matter often mentioned by the best class of ex-Confederate
soldiers: the Southern soldier believed that the "Appomattox Program" had not been carried
out. At Appomattox the magnanimity of General Grant and the victorious soldiers had impressed
very favorably the defeated Confederates. The latter believed that if Grant and the soldiers
who had defeated them had been allowed to settle matters, there would have been no more trouble.
Instead, the politicians had taken charge and had stirred up endless strife. No effort at conciliation
had been made; and the magnanimity of Grant gave way to the vindictive policies of politicians.[11]
The whites believed that the "understanding of Appomattox" had been violated and that they
had been deliberately humiliated by the Washington government.

Such were some of the influences, in General Gordon's opinion, that caused the spread of the
Klan in Georgia. He says that he heartily approved the objects of the order, that it was purely
for self-protection, an organization for police purposes, a peace police, which kept the peace,
prevented riots, and restrained the passionate whites as well as the violent blacks. Its membership
was, he said, of the best citizens, mostly ex-Confederates, led by the instinct of self-preservation
to band together. It was secret because the leaders were sure that the sympathy of the Federal
Government would be against them and would consider a public organization a fresh rebellion.
It took no part in politics and died out when the whites were able to obtain protection from
the police and the courts.

These were the explanations of men who were high in the order but who never attended a meeting
and were never in actual contact with its workings. Private members--Ghouls they were called--could
have told more thrilling stories. But deficient as the accounts of Gordon and Forrest are in
detail they supplement the history of Lester and Wilson in explaining the causes that lay at
the bottom of the secret revolution generally called the Ku Klux Movement.

As to the success or failure of the movement, Lester and Wilson, condemning the violence that
naturally resulted from the movement, cause the impression (Ch. 4) that the main result was
disorder. Such was not the case, nor was it the intention of the writers to create such an
impression. The important work of the Klan was accomplished in regaining for the whites control
over the social order and in putting them in a fair way to regain political control. In some
States this occurred sooner than in others. When the order accomplished its work it passed
away. It was formally disbanded before the evil results of carpet bag governments could be
seen. When it went out of existence in 1869, there had been few outrages, but its name and
prestige lived after it and served to hide the evil deeds of all sorts and conditions of outlaws.
But these could be crushed by the government, State or Federal. In a wider and truer sense
the phrase "Ku Klux Movement" means the attitude of Southern whites toward the various measures
of Reconstruction lasting from 1865 until 1876, and, in some respects, almost to the present day.

       *       *       *       *       *

Two elaborate Prescripts or Constitutions were adopted by the Ku Klux Klan--the original Prescript
(See Appendix I) and the Revised and Amended Prescript (See Appendix II). The ritual and initiatory
ceremonies and obligations were never printed. The by-laws and the ritual of the Pulaski Circle
or Den were elaborate but were in manuscript only. They were quite absurd and were intended
only to furnish amusement to the members at the expense of the candidates for initiation. No
oaths were prescribed--only a pledge of secrecy. As the Klan spread among neighboring towns,
the Pulaski by-laws and ritual were modified for the use of new Dens. After the Klan had changed
character and become a body of regulators, and it was decided that the administration should
be centralized, a convention of delegates from the Dens met in Nashville, in April, 1867, and
adopted the original Prescript already referred to. Lester and Wilson are mistaken in saying
(Ch. 3) that the Revised and Amended Prescript was adopted at this convention. Where and how
this Prescript was printed no one now knows. A copy was sent, without notice or explanation,
from Memphis to the Grand Cyclops of each Den. It must have been printed in a small printing
office since in the last pages the supply of *'s and +'s ran out and other characters were
substituted. Many Dens used only this Prescript, and most of the members have never heard of
more than one Prescript.

In some respects this first Constitution was found defective and in 1868 the Revised and Amended
Prescript was adopted. Who framed it we do not know, but it is known how it was printed. Frank
O. McCord, one of the founders of the Pulaski Circle, was editor of the Pulaski Citizen. A
relative of his who worked in the printing office of the Citizen, made the following statement
some years ago in reference to a copy of the Revised and Amended Prescript.[12]

"This is an exact copy of the original Prescript printed in the office of the Pulaski (Tennessee)
Citizen, L.W. McCord, proprietor, in 1868. I was a printer boy, and with John H. Kirk, the
father of the Rev. Harry Kirk, recently of Nashville, set the type. My brother, L.W. McCord,
received a communication one day, delivered to him by means of a hole in the wall near the
door, in which the Ku Klux deposited all their communications for the paper, asking for an
estimate for printing this pamphlet, describing it. He delivered his reply in the same hole,
and the following morning the copy in full, the money, and minute directions as to the disposition
of the books when completed, were in the hole. We did it all under seal of secrecy and concealment,
hid the galleys of type as they were set up, stitched them with our own hands in a back room
over Shapard's store, and trimmed them with a shoe knife on the floor. When finished they were
tied into a bundle and deposited late at night just outside the office door, whence they were
immediately taken by unseen hands. I knew personally all the originators of the Ku Klux Klan,
and the history of its origin, its deeds, purposes and accomplishments.

                                             "LAPS D. MCCORD."[13]

It will be noticed on comparing the two Prescripts that there are some considerable differences
between the two. The Revised and Amended Prescript is eight pages longer than the other; the
name of the order is longer; the poetical selections that introduce the first are omitted from
the second; the second has Latin quotations only at the top of the page; and the second Prescript
throws much more light on the character and objects of the order; the register is changed,
and important changes in the administration are provided for.

The imperfect Prescript printed in Appendix III was used in the Carolinas and was evidently
written out from memory by some person who had belonged to the genuine Klan. The members were
widely scattered and to many of them the entire contents of the Prescript were never known.

When the Klan was disbanded strict orders were issued that all documents relating to the order
should be destroyed and few Prescripts escaped. At present only one copy of the original copy
is known to be in existence. That one was used by Ryland Randolph, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
formerly Grand Giant of a province of the order, and was given to me by him. It is a little
brown pamphlet of sixteen pages, and is reprinted in Appendix I. Randolph stated that he never
saw the Revised Prescript. There are two copies of the Revised and Amended Prescript, one in
the library of the Southern Society of New York, which is now deposited with the Columbia University
Library; the other belongs to Mr. J.L. Pearcy, formerly of Nashville, now of Washington, D.C.
From the latter copy the late Dr. W.R. Garrett, of Nashville, had the plates made that are
now used in reproducing the Revised and Amended Prescript in Appendix II.

       *       *       *       *       *

The curious orders and warnings printed in Appendix IV had several purposes. They were meant
to warn and frighten evil-doers, to mystify the public, and to give notice to members. Parts
of the orders were written in cypher which could be interpreted by the initiated. The rest
was gloomy sounding nonsense calculated to alarm some obnoxious person or persons. The cypher
used is found in the Register of the Prescript. All orders that I have seen were written according
to the Register of the first Prescript. This may be accounted for by the fact that in 1868
it was generally forbidden by law or by military order to print or distribute notices from
the Ku Klux Klan. About all that the cypher was used for, I have been told, was to fix dates,
etc. There are thirty-one adjectives in the Register, one for each day of the month, the first
twelve for the morning hours, the last twelve for the evening hours, and the seven in the middle
for the days of the week. The last word--"Cumberland"--is said to have been a general password.
At first the orders were printed in the newspapers, and during the winter of 1867-1868 and
the spring of 1868 many of them appeared. As to the significance of the orders printed in Appendix
IV, Ryland Randolph wrote: "I well remember those notices you saw in The Monitor for they were
concocted and posted by my own hand, disguised, of course." ... "You ask if any of the notices
you saw in The Monitor had any real meaning. Well, they had this much meaning: the very night
of the day on which these notices made their appearances, three notably offensive negro men
were dragged out of their beds, escorted to the old bone-yard (¾ mile from Tuscaloosa) and
thrashed in the regular ante-bellum style until their unnatural nigger pride had a tumble,
and humbleness to the white man reigned supreme."

Some of the illustrations used are of historical interest. The cartoon opposite p. 192 is taken
from the Independent Monitor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a Ku Klux newspaper. The hanging carpetbagger
was Rev. A.S. Lakin, of Ohio, a Northern Methodist missionary to the negroes, who had succeeded
in getting himself elected President of the University of Alabama. The other hanging figure
represents Dr. N.B. Cloud, the scalawag superintendent of public instruction who was assisting
Lakin to get his position. They were both driven from Tuscaloosa by the Klan. The wood-cut
from which this picture was printed was fashioned by Randolph himself in The Monitor office.
The picture was eagerly welcomed by the Reconstructionists as an evidence of the state of affairs
in Alabama, and it was reproduced far and wide during the Presidential campaign of 1868. Randolph's
brother Democrats were furious because he had furnished such excellent campaign material to
the other side. In one of Randolph's letters he states: "The name of the Ohio newspaper that
republished my famous wood-cut was the Cincinnati Commercial. I have good authority for stating
that said paper issued 500,000 copies for distribution throughout Ohio during the Seymour-Grant
campaign. Not only this, but a Columbus, Ohio, paper also issued a large edition."

The cartoon opposite p. 113 is reproduced from "The Loil Legislature," a pamphlet by Capt.
B.H. Screws, of Montgomery. The Alabama Reconstruction Legislature was the first to make an
investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Sibley and Coon were two carpetbaggers active in the investigation.

Opposite p. 196 is a typical warning sent to persons obnoxious to the Klan. It is taken from
the Ku Klux Report, Alabama Testimony.

The costumes represented opposite p. 58 were captured in Mississippi and were worn both in
Mississippi and in Western Alabama. The costumes represented opposite p. 97 were captured after
the famous Ku Klux parade in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1868. Federal soldiers donned the captured
disguises and were photographed. During the campaign of 1868 the pictures were reproduced in
the Reconstructionist newspapers.

Miss Cora R. Jones kindly furnished a drawing (see outside cover) of the badge worn by the
higher officials of the Klan, and a sketch of the room (see p. 53) in which the Klan was founded.
Her uncle, Calvin Jones, was one of the founders, the father, Charles P. Jones, was also a
member and the badge mentioned belonged to him.

KU KLUX KLAN

ITS ORIGIN, GROWTH AND DISBANDMENT

BY

J.C. LESTER AND D.L. WILSON

KU KLUX KLAN

CHAPTER I.

THE ORIGIN.

There is no stranger chapter in American history than the one which bears for a title "Ku Klux
Klan." The organization which bore this name went out of life as it came into it, shrouded
in deepest mystery. Its members would not disclose its secrets; others could not. Even the
investigation committee, appointed by Congress, were baffled. The voluminous reports containing
the results of that committee's tedious and diligent inquiry do not tell when and where and
how the Ku Klux Klan originated. The veil of secrecy still hangs over its grave. We propose
to lift it.

The time has now arrived when the history of the origin, growth and final decay of "The Invisible
Empire" may be given to the public. Circumstances not necessary to detail have put it in the
power of the writer to compile such a history. For obvious reasons the names of individuals
are withheld. But the reader may feel assured that this narrative is drawn from sources which
are accurate and authentic.

The writer does not profess to be able to disclose the secret signs, grips and pass-words of
the order.[14] These have never been disclosed and probably never will be. But we claim to
narrate facts relating to the order, which have a historic and philosophic value. It is due
to the truth of history; to the student of human nature; to the statesmen, and to the men who
were engaged in this movement, that the facts connected with this remarkable episode in our
nation's history be frankly and fairly told.

A wave of excitement, spreading by contagions till the minds of a whole people are in a ferment,
is an event of frequent occurrent. The Ku Klux movement was peculiar by reason of the causes
which produced and fed the excitement. It illustrates the weird and irresistible power of the
unknown and mysterious over the minds of men of all classes and conditions in life. And it
illustrates how men, by circumstances and conditions, in part of their own creation, may be
carried away from their moorings and drifted along in a course against which reason and judgment
protest.

The popular idea supposes the Ku Klux movement to have been conceived in malice, and nursed
by prejudice and hate, for lawlessness, rapine and murder. The circumstances which brought
the Klan into notice and notoriety were of a character to favor such conclusions. No other
seemed possible. The report of the Congressional Investigating Committee confirmed it.[15]
Even if that report be true, like everything else which is known of the Ku Klux, it is fragmentary
truth. The whole story has never been told. And the impression prevails that the Ku Klux Klan
was conceived and carried out in pure and unmixed deviltry. The reader who follows this narrative
to its end will decide, with the facts before him, whether this impression is just and true.

The Ku Klux Klan was the outgrowth of peculiar conditions, social, civil and political, which
prevailed at the South from 1865 to 1869. It was as much a product of those conditions as malaria
is of a swamp and sun heat.

Its birthplace was Pulaski, the capital of Giles, one of the southern tier of counties in Middle
Tennessee. Pulaski is a town of about three thousand inhabitants. Previous to the war its citizens
possessed wealth and culture--they retain the second--the first was lost in the general wreck.
The most intimate association with them fails to disclose a trace of the diabolism which, according
to the popular idea, one would expect to find characterizing the people among whom the Ku Klux
Klan originated. A male college and a female seminary are located at Pulaski, and receive liberal
patronage. It is a town of churches.

There, in 1866, the name Ku Klux first fell from human lips. There began a movement which in
a short time spread as far north as Virginia[16] and as far south as Texas, and which for a
period convulsed the country and attracted the attention of the civilized world. Proclamations
were fulminated against the Klan by the President and by the Governors of States; and hostile
statutes were enacted both by State and National Legislatures.

It was finally quieted, but not until there had become associated with the name Ku Klux gross
mistakes and lawless deeds of violence. To this day there are localities where the utterance
of it awakens awe and fear.

During the entire period of the Klan's organized existence, Pulaski continued to be its central
seat of authority. Some of its highest officers resided there. This narrative, therefore, will
relate principally to the growth of the Klan and the measures taken to suppress it in Tennessee.
It is necessary to a clear understanding of the movement to observe that the history of the
Klan is marked by two distinct and well defined periods. The first period covers the time from
its organization, in 1866, to the summer of 1867. The second from the summer of 1867 to the
date of its disbandment in the early part of the year 1869.[17]

The first period contains but little of general interest, but it is necessary to describe it
somewhat minutely, because of its bearing on subsequent events. When the war ended, the young
men of Pulaski, who had escaped death on the battlefield, returned home and passed through
a period of enforced inactivity. In some respects it was more trying than the ordeal of war
which lay behind them. The reaction which followed the excitement of army scenes and service
was intense. There was nothing to relieve it. They could not engage at once in business or
professional pursuits. In the case of many, business habits were broken up. Few had capital
to enter mercantile or agricultural enterprises. There was a total lack of the amusements and
social diversions which prevail wherever society is in a normal condition.

One evening in May, 1866,[18] a few of these young men met in the office of one of the most
prominent members of the Pulaski bar.[19] In the course of the conversation one of the number
said: "Boys, let us get up a club or society of some description." The suggestion was discussed
with enthusiasm. Before they separated it was agreed to invite others, whose names were mentioned,
to join them, and to meet again the next evening at the same place. At the appointed time eight
or[20] ten young men had assembled.

A temporary organization was effected by the election of a chairman and a secretary. There
was entire unanimity among the members in regard to the end in view, which was diversion and
amusement. The evening was spent in discussing the best means of attaining the object for which
they were seeking. Two committees were appointed, one to select a name,[21] the other[22] to
prepare a set of rules for the government of the society, and a ritual for the initiation of
new members. The club adjourned to meet the following week to hear and act upon the reports
of these committees. Before the arrival of the appointed time for the next meeting, one of
the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Pulaski went on a business trip to Columbus,
Miss., taking his family with him. Before leaving he invited one of the leading spirits of
the new society to take charge of and sleep at his house during his absence. This young man
invited his comrades to join him there. And so the place of meeting was changed from the law
office to this residence. The owner of it outlived the Ku Klux Klan and died ignorant of the
fact that his house was the place where its organization was fully effected.

This residence afterwards came into the possession of Judge H.M. Spofford, of Spofford-Kellogg
fame.[23] It was his home at the time of his death, and is still owned by his widow.

The committee appointed to select a name reported that they had found the task difficult, and
had not made a selection. They explained that they had been trying to discover or invent a
name which would be, to some extent, suggestive of the character and objects of the society.
They mentioned several which they had been considering. In this number was the name "Kukloi"
from the Greek word Kuklos (Kuklos), meaning a band or circle. At mention of this some one
cried out: "Call it Ku Klux." "Klan" at once suggested itself, and was added to complete the
alliteration. So instead of adopting a name, as was the first intention, which had a definite
meaning, they chose one which to the proposer of it, and to every one else, was absolutely
meaningless.

This trivial and apparently accidental incident had a most important bearing on the future
of the organization so singularly named. Looking back over the history of the Klan, and at
the causes under which it developed, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the order
would never have grown to the proportions which it afterwards assumed, or wielded the power
it did, had it not borne this name or some other equally as meaningless and mysterious--mysterious
because meaningless.

Had they called themselves the "Jolly Jokers" or the "Adelphi," or by some similar appellation,
the organization would doubtless have had no more than the mere local and ephemeral existence
which those who organized it contemplated for it. Hundreds of societies have originated just
as this one did, and after a brief existence have passed away. But in this case there was a
weird potency in the very name Ku Klux Klan. Let the reader pronounce it aloud. The sound of
it is suggestive of bones rattling together! The potency of the name was not wholly in the
impression made by it on the general public. It is a singular fact that the members of the
Klan were themselves the first to feel its weird influence; they had adopted a mysterious name.
Thereupon the original plan was modified so as to make everything connected with the order
harmonize with the name.

Amusement was still the end in view. But now the method by which they propose to win it were
those of secrecy and mystery. So when the report of the committee on rules and ritual came
up for consideration, the recommendations were modified to adapt them to the new idea. The
report as finally adopted, provided for the following officers: a Grand Cyclops, or President;
a Grand Magi, or Vice-President; a Grand Turk, or Marshal; a Grand Exchequer, or Treasurer;
and two Lictors. These were the outer and inner guards of the "Den," as the place of meeting
was designated.

The one obligation exacted from members was to maintain profound and absolute secrecy with
reference to the order and everything pertaining to it. This obligation prohibited those who
assumed it from disclosing that they were Ku Klux, or the name of any other member, and from
soliciting any one to become a member. The last requirement was a singular one. It was enacted
for two reasons. First, it was in keeping with the determination to appear as mysterious as
possible, and thus play upon the curiosity of the public. Secondly, and mainly, it was designed
to prevent unpleasantness following initiations. They wished to be able to say to novices:
"You are here on your own solicitation, and not by invitation from us." They desired accessions;
to have them was indispensable; but they knew human nature well enough to know that if they
made the impression that they wished to be exclusive and select, then applications for membership
would be numerous. The result showed that they reasoned correctly.

Each member was required to provide himself with the following outfit: A white mask for the
face, with orifices for the eyes and nose; a tall, fantastic cardboard hat, so constructed
as to increase the wearer's apparent height; a gown, or robe, of sufficient length to cover
the entire person. No particular color or material were prescribed. These were left to the
individual's taste and fancy, and each selected what in his judgment would be the most hideous
and fantastic, with the aim of inspiring the greatest amount of curiosity in the novice. These
robes, of different colors, often of the most flashy patterns of "Dolly Varden" calicos, added
vastly to the grotesque appearance of the assembled Klan.[24]

Each member carried also a small whistle, with which, by means of a code of signals agreed
upon, they held communications with one another. The only utility of this device was to awaken
inquiry.[25]

And the object of all this was amusement--"only this, and nothing more." A few young men debarred
for the time by circumstances from entering any active business or professional pursuits, and
deprived of the ordinary diversions of social life, were seeking in this way to amuse and employ
themselves. The organization of this Klan was to them both diversion and occupation. But where,
it may be asked, did the fun come in? Partly in exciting the curiosity of the public, and then
in baffling it; but mainly in the initiation of new members.

The ritual used in the initiation was elaborate, but not worthy of reproduction. It is enough
to say that it was modeled on and embraced the leading features of the ritual of an order which
has long been popular in colleges and universities under various names.[26] In one place it
is the "Sons of Confucius;" in another, the "Guiasticutus;" but everywhere, the "Ancient and
the Honorable," and the "Mirth-Provoking."

The initiations were at first conducted in the law office, where the suggestion for the formation
of the Klan had been made. But it was not a suitable place. The room was small. It was near
the business portion of the town, and while in session there, they never felt entirely free
from apprehensions of interruption.[27]

They soon found a place in every respect better adapted to their purposes. On the brow of a
ridge, that runs along the western outskirts of the town, there used to stand a handsome and
commodious residence. The front, or main building, was of brick, the "L" of wood. In December,
1865, the brick portion of this house was demolished by a cyclone. The "L" remained standing,
but tenantless. It consisted of three rooms. A stairway led from one of them to a large cellar
beneath. No other house stood near. Around these ruins were the storm-torn, limbless trunks
of trees, which had once formed a magnificent grove. Now, they stood up, grim and gaunt, like
spectre sentinels. A dreary, desolate, uncanny place it was. But it was, in every way, most
suitable for a "den," and the Klan appropriated it.[28]

When a meeting was held, one Lictor was stationed near the house, the other fifty yards from
it on the road leading into town. These were dressed in the fantastic regalia of the order
and bore tremendous spears as the badge of their office.

As before stated, and for the reasons assigned, the Ku Klux did not solicit any one to join
them; yet, they had applications for membership. While members were not allowed to disclose
the fact of their membership, they were permitted to talk with others in regard to anything
that was a matter of common report with reference to the order. If they chose, members were
allowed to say to outsiders: "I am going to join the Ku Klux." If the persons addressed expressed
a desire to do likewise, the Ku Klux would say, if the party was a desirable one: "Well, I
think I know how to get in. Meet me at such a place, on such a night, at such an hour, and
we will join together." Other similar subterfuges were resorted to, to secure members without
direct solicitation. Usually, curiosity would predominate over every other consideration, and
the candidate would be found waiting at the appointed place.

As the Ku Klux and the candidate approached the sentinel Lictor, they were hailed and halted
and questioned. Having received the assurance that they desired to become Ku Klux, the Lictor
blew the signal for his companion to come and take charge of the novices. The candidate, under
the impression that his companion was similarly treated, was blindfolded and led to the "den."
The preliminaries of the initiation consisted in leading the candidate around the rooms and
down into the cellar, now and then placing before him obstructions which added to his discomfort,
if not to his mystification. After some rough sport of this description, he was led before
the Grand Cyclops who solemnly addressed to him numerous questions. Some of these questions
were grave, and occasionally a faulty answer resulted in the candidate's rejection. For the
most part they were absurd to the last degree. If the answers were satisfactory, the obligation
to secrecy, already administered, was exacted a second time. Then the Grand Cyclops commanded:

"Place him before the royal altar and adorn his head with the regal crown."

The "royal altar" was a large looking glass. The "regal crown" was a huge hat bedecked with
two enormous donkey ears. In this headgear the candidate was placed before the mirror and directed
to repeat the couplet:

    "O wad some power the giftie gie us
    To see oursel's as ithers see us."

As the last word was falling from his lips, the Grand Turk removed the bandage from his eyes,
and before the candidate was his own ludicrous image in the mirror. To increase the discomfiture
and chagrin which any man in such a situation would naturally feel, the removal of the bandage
was the signal to the Klan for indulgence in the most uproarious and boisterous mirth. The
Grand Cyclops relaxed the rigor of his rule, and the decorum hitherto maintained disappeared,
and the "den" rang with shouts and peals of laughter; and worse than all, as he looked about
him, he saw that he was surrounded by men dressed in hideous garb and masked, so that he could
not recognize one of them.

The character of these initiatory proceedings explains why, from the very first, secrecy was
so much insisted on. A single "tale out of school" would have spoiled the fun. For the same
reason the Klan, in its early history, was careful in regard to the character of the men admitted.
Rash and imprudent men--such as could not be confidently relied upon to respect their obligation
to secrecy--were excluded. Nor were those admitted who were addicted to the use of intoxicants.
Later on in the history they were not so careful, but in the earlier period of its existence
the Klan was composed of men of good habits.[29]

In some instances, persons not regarded as eligible to membership, or not desirable, were persistent
even to annoyance in their efforts to gain admission to the order. Such persistence was occasionally
rebuked in a manner more emphatic than tender.

One young man had a consuming desire to be a Ku Klux. The sole objection, to him was his youth.
When he presented himself to the Lictor, the latter received him kindly, and led him blindfold,
"over the hill and far away" to a secluded spot, and left him with the admonition to "wait
there till called for." After hours of weary waiting, the young man removed the bandage from
his eyes and sought the shelter of the paternal roof.

Another of riper years, but for some reason not acceptable to the order, made repeated efforts
to join the Klan. For his special benefit they arranged to have an initiation not provided
for in the ritual. A meeting was appointed to be held on the top of a hill that rises by a
gentle slope to a considerable height, on the northern limits of Pulaski. The candidate, in
the usual way--blindfold excepted--was led into the presence of the Grand Cyclops. This dignitary
was standing on a stump. The tall hat, the flowing robe, and the elevated position made him
appear not less than ten feet tall. He addressed to the candidate a few unimportant and absurd
questions, and then, turning to the Lictors, said: "Blindfold the candidate and proceed."

The "procedure" in this case was to place the would-be Ku Klux in a barrel, provided for the
purpose, and to send him whirling down the hill! To his credit, be it said, he never revealed
any of the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.[30]

These details have an important bearing on the subsequent history of the Ku Klux. They show
that the originators of the Klan were not meditating treason or lawlessness in any form. Yet
the Klan's later history grew naturally out of the measures and methods which characterized
this period of it. Its projectors did not expect it to spread. They thought it would "have
its little day and die." It lived; it grew to vast proportions.

CHAPTER II.

THE SPREAD OF THE KLAN.

The devices for attracting attention were eminently successful. During the months of July and
August, 1866, the Klan was much talked about by the citizens of Pulaski. Its mysteriousness
was the sensation of the hour. Every issue of the local paper contained some notice of the
strange order. These notices were copied into other papers, and in this manner the way was
prepared for the rapid growth and spread of the Klan which soon followed.

Six weeks or less from the date of the organization the sensation in Pulaski had reached its
height and was waning. Curiosity in regard to it had abated to such a degree that the Klan
would have certainly fallen to pieces but for the following circumstances:

By the time the eligible material in the town had been used up, the young men from the country,
whose curiosity had been inflamed by the newspaper notices, began to come in and apply for
admission to the Klan. Some of these applications were accepted. In a little while the members
from the country asked permission to establish "dens" at various points in the county. No provision
had been made for such a contingency, but the permission was granted; had it not been, the
result in all probability would have been the same.

As the ritual followed by the Pulaski Klan could not be conveniently carried out in the country,
various modifications and changes were permitted. But the strictest injunctions were laid on
these new lodges, or dens, in regard to secrecy, mystery and the character of the men admitted.
The growth in the rural districts was more rapid than it had been in the town. Applications
for permission to establish "dens" multiplied rapidly.

The news that the Ku Klux were spreading to the country excited the attention of the country
people more generally than the existence of the Klan in town had done. The same cause rekindled
the waning interest of the town people. Every issue of the local papers in the "infected regions"
bristled with highly mysterious and exciting accounts of the doings of the "fantastic gentry."

During the fall and winter of 1866 the growth of the Klan was rapid. It spread over a wide
extent of territory. Sometimes, by a sudden leap, it appeared in localities far distant from
any existing "dens."

A stranger from West Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama or Texas, visiting in a neighborhood where
the order prevailed, would be initiated, and on his departure carry with him permission to
establish a "den" at home. In fact, it was often done without such permission. The connecting
link between these "dens" was very fragile. By a sort of tacit agreement the Pulaski Klan was
regarded as the source of power and authority. The Grand Cyclops of this "den" was virtually
the ruler of the order, but as he had no method of communicating with subjects or subordinates,
and no way in which to enforce his mandates, his authority was more fancy than fact. But so
far there had appeared no need for compact organization, rigid rules and close supervision.
The leading spirits of the Ku Klux Klan were contemplating nothing more serious than amusement.
They enjoyed the baffled curiosity and wild speculations of a mystified public even more than
the rude sport afforded by the ludicrous initiations.

Such is the account of the Ku Klux Klan in the first period of its history from June, 1866
to April, 1867;[31] yet all this time it was gradually, in a very natural way, taking on new
features not at first remotely contemplated by the originators of the order; features which
finally transformed the Ku Klux Klan into a band of "Regulators."

The transformation was effected by the combined operation of several causes: (1) The impressions
made by the order upon the minds of those who united with it; (2) The impressions upon the
public by its weird and mysterious methods; (3) The anomalous and peculiar condition of affairs
in the South at this time.

The mystery and secrecy with which the Klan veiled itself made a singular impression on the
minds of many who united with it.

The prevalent idea was that the Klan contemplated some great and important mission. This idea
aided in its rapid growth. And on the other hand the rapid extensions of the Klan confirmed
this idea of its purposes. When admitted to membership this conclusion, in the case of many,
was deepened rather than removed by what they saw and heard. There was not a word in the ritual
or in the obligation or in any part of the ceremony to favor such a conclusion; but the impression
still remained that this mysteriousness and secrecy, the high-sounding titles of the officers,
the grotesque dress of the members, and the formidable obligation, all meant more than real
sport. This impression was ineradicable, and the attitude of many of the members continued
to be that of expecting great developments. Each had his own speculations as to what was to
be the character of the serious work which the Klan had to do. But they were satisfied that
there was such work. It was an unhealthy and dangerous state of mind for men to be in; bad
results in some cases very naturally followed from it.

The impression made by the Klan on the public was the second cause which contributed to its
transformation into a band of Regulators. When the meetings first began to be held in the dilapidated
house on the hill, passers-by were frequent. Most of them passed the grim and ghostly sentinel
on the roadside in silence, but always with a quickened step. Occasionally one would stop and
ask: "Who are you?" In awfully sepulchral tones the invariable answer was: "A spirit from the
other world. I was killed at Chickamauga."

Such an answer, especially when given to a superstitious negro, was extremely terrifying, and
if, in addition, he heard the uproarous noises issuing from the "den" at the moment of a candidate's
investiture with the "regal crown," he had the foundation for a most awe-inspiring story. There
came from the country similar stories. The belated laborer, passing after nightfall, some lonely
and secluded spot, heard horrible noises and saw fearful sights. These stories were repeated
with such embellishments as the imagination of the narrator suggested, till the feeling of
the negroes and of many of the white people, at mention of the Ku Klux, was one of awe and terror.

In a short time the Lictor of the Pulaski "den" reported that travel along the road on which
he had his post had almost entirely stopped. In the country it was noticed that the nocturnal
perambulation of the colored population diminished, or entirely ceased, wherever the Ku Klux
appeared. In many ways there was a noticeable improvement in the habits of a large class who
had hitherto been causing great annoyance. In this way the Klan gradually realized that the
most powerful devices ever constructed for controlling the ignorant and superstitious were
in their hands. Even the most highly cultured were not able wholly to resist the weird and
peculiar feeling which pervaded every community where the Ku Klux appeared. Each week some
new incident occurred to illustrate the amazing power of the unknown over the minds of men
of all classes.

Circumstances made it evident that the measures and methods employed for sport might be effectually
used to subserve the public welfare--to suppress lawlessness and protect property. When propositions
to this effect began to be urged, there were many who hesitated, fearing danger. The majority
regarded such fears as groundless. They pointed to the good results which had already been
produced. The argument was forcible--almost unanswerable. And the question was decided without
formal action. The very force of circumstances had carried the Klan away from its original
purpose. So that in the beginning of the summer of 1867 it was virtually, though not yet professedly,
a band of regulators, honestly, but in an injudicious and dangerous way, trying to protect
property and preserve peace and order.[32]

After all, the most powerful agency in effecting this transformation, the agency which supplied
the conditions under which the two causes just mentioned became operative, was the peculiar
state of affairs existing at the South at that time.

As every one knows, the condition of things was wholly anomalous, but no one can fully appreciate
the circumstances by which the people of the South were surrounded except by personal observation
and experience; and no one who is not fully acquainted with all the facts in the case is competent
to pronounce a just judgment on their behavior. On this account, not only the Ku Klux, but
the mass of the Southern people, have been tried, convicted and condemned at the bar of public
opinion, and have been denied the equity of having the sentence modified by mitigating circumstances,
which in justice, they have a right to plead.

At that time the throes of the great revolution were settling down to quiet. The almost universal
disposition of the better class of the people was to accept the arbitrament which the sword
had accorded them. On this point there was practical unanimity. Those who had opportunity and
facilities to do so, engaged at once in agricultural, professional or business pursuits. There
was but little disposition to take part in politics.

But there were two causes of vexation and exasperation which the people were in no good mood
to bear. One of these causes related to that class of men who, like scum, had been thrown to
the surface in the great upheaval.[33]

It was not simply that they were Union men from conviction. That would have been readily forgiven
then, as can be shown by pointing to hundreds of cases. But the majority of the class referred
to had played traitor to both sides, and were Union men now only because that was the successful
side. And worse than all, they were now engaged in keeping alive discord and strife between
the sections, as the only means of preventing themselves from sinking back into the obscurity
from which they had been upheaved. Their conduct was malicious in the extreme and exceedingly
exasperating. These men were a "thorn in the flesh" of the body, politic and social; and the
effort to expel it set up an inflammation which for a time awakened the gravest apprehensions
as to the result.

The second disturbing element was the negroes. Their transition from slavery to citizenship
was sudden. They were not only not fitted for the cares of self-control, and maintenance so
suddenly thrust upon them, but many of them entered their new role in life under the delusion
that freedom meant license. They regarded themselves as freedmen, not only from bondage to
former masters, but from the common and ordinary obligations of citizenship. Many of them looked
upon obedience to the laws of the state--which had been framed by their former owners--as in
some measure a compromise of the rights with which they had been invested. The administration
of civil law was only partially re-established. On that account, and for other reasons, there
was an amount of disorder and violence prevailing over the country which has never been equaled
at any period of its history. If the officers of the law had had the disposition and ability
to arrest all law-breakers, a jail and court-house in every civil district would have been
required.

The depredations on property by theft and by wanton destruction for the gratification of petty
revenge, were to the last degree annoying. A large part of these depredations was the work
of bad white men, who expected that their lawless deeds would be credited to the negroes. But
perhaps the most potent of all causes which brought about this transformation was the existence
in the South of a spurious and perverted form of the "Union League."[34]

It would be as unfair to this organization as it existed at the North, to charge it with the
outrages committed under cover of its name, as it is to hold the Ku Klux Klan responsible for
all the lawlessness and violence with which it is credited.

But it is a part of the history of those times that there was a widespread and desperately
active organization called the "Union League." It was composed of the disorderly element of
the negro population and was led and controlled by white men of the basest and meanest type
just now referred to. They met frequently, went armed to the teeth, and literally "breathed
out threatening and slaughter." They not only uttered, but in many instances executed the most
violent threats against the persons, families and property of men, whose sole crime was that
they had been in the Confederate army. It cannot be truthfully denied that the Ku Klux committed
excesses and were charged with wrongdoing. But they were never guilty of the disorderly and
unprovoked deeds of deviltry which mark the history of the Southern "Union League." It was
partly, I may say chiefly, to resist this aggressive and belligerent organization that the
Ku Klux transformed themselves into a protective organization.[35]

Whatever may be the judgment of history, those who know the facts will ever remain firm in
the conviction that the Ku Klux Klan was of immense service at this period of Southern history.
Without it, in many sections of the South, life to decent people would not have been tolerable.
It served a good purpose. Wherever the Ku Klux appeared the effect was salutary. For a while
the robberies ceased. The lawless class assumed the habits of good behavior.

The "Union League" relaxed its desperate severity and became more moderate. Under their fear
of the dreaded Ku Klux, the negroes made more progress, in a few months, in the needed lessons
of self-control, industry, and respect for the rights of property and general good behavior,
than they would have done in as many years, but for this or some equally powerful impulse.

It was a rough and a dangerous way to teach such lessons, but under all the circumstances it
seemed the only possible way.

Of course, these men were trying a dangerous experiment. Many of them knew it at the time,
and did not expect it on the whole to turn out more successfully than others of a similar character.
But there seemed to be no other alternative at the time. Events soon occurred which showed
that the fears of those who apprehended danger were not groundless, and it became evident,
unless the Klan should be brought under better control than its leaders at this time exercised
over it, that while it suppressed some evils, it would give rise to others almost, if not fully,
as great.[36]

CHAPTER III.

THE TRANSFORMATION.

Until the beginning of the year 1867, the movements of the Klan had, in the main, been characterized
by prudence and discretion; but there were some exceptions. In some cases there had been a
liberal construction of orders and of what was by common consent the law of the Klan. In some,
the limits, which tacitly it had been agreed upon not to pass, had been overstepped.

Attempts had been made to correct by positive means evils which menaces had not been sufficient
to remove. Rash, imprudent and bad men had gotten into the order. The danger which the more
prudent and thoughtful had apprehended as possible was now a reality. Had it been possible
to do so, some of the leaders would have been in favor of disbanding. That could not well be
done, because at that time the organization was so loose and imperfect. So to speak, the tie
that bound them together was too shadowy to be cut or untied. They had evoked a spirit from
"the vasty deep." It would not down at their bidding.

And, besides, the Klan was needed. The only course which seemed to promise any satisfactory
solution of the difficulty was this: To reorganize the Klan on a plan corresponding to its
size and present purposes; to bind the isolated dens together; to secure unity of purpose and
concert of action; to hedge the members up by such limitations and regulations as were best
adapted to restrain them within proper limits; to distribute the authority among prudent men
at local centres, and exact from them a close supervision of those under their charge.

In this way it was hoped the impending dangers would be effectually guarded against. With these
objects in view the Grand Cyclops of the Pulaski Den sent out a request to all the dens of
which he had knowledge, to appoint delegates to meet in convention at Nashville, Tenn., in
the early summer of 1867.[37] At the time appointed this convention was held. Delegates were
present from Tennessee, Alabama, and a number of other States. A plan of reorganization, previously
prepared, was submitted to this convention and adopted. After the transaction of some further
business, the convention adjourned, and the delegates returned home without having attracted
any attention.

At this convention the territory covered by the Klan was designated as the "Invisible Empire."
This was subdivided into "realms" coterminous with the boundaries of States. The "realms" were
divided into "dominions," corresponding to Congressional districts; the "dominions" into "provinces"
coterminous with counties; and the "provinces" into "dens."

To each of these departments officers were assigned.

Except in the case of the supreme officer, the duties of each were minutely specified.

These officers were:

The Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire and his ten Genii. The powers of this officer were
almost autocratic.

The Grand Dragon of the Realm and his eight Hydras.

The Grand Titan of the Dominion and his six Furies.

The Grand Cyclops of the Den and his two Night Hawks.

A Grand Monk.

A Grand Scribe.

A Grand Exchequer.

A Grand Turk.

A Grand Sentinel.

The Genii, Hydras, Furies, Goblins and Night Hawks were staff officers. The gradation and distribution
of authority was perfect. But for one source of weakness, the Klan, under this new organization,
was one of the most perfectly organized orders that ever existed in the world.

As we shall see presently, it was vulnerable and failed because of the character of its methods.
Secrecy was at first its strength. It afterwards became its greatest weakness. As long as mystery
was conjoined with it, it was strength. When masks and disguises ceased to be mysterious, secrecy
was weakness.

One of the most important things done by this Nashville convention was to make a positive and
emphatic declaration of the principles of the order. It was in the following terms:

"We recognize our relations to the United States Government; the supremacy of the Constitution;
the constitutional laws thereof; and the union of States thereunder."

If these men were plotting treason, it puzzles us to know why they should make such a statement
as that in setting forth the principles of the order. The statement above quoted was not intended
for general circulation and popular effect. So far as is known, it is now given to the public
for the first time. We must regard it, therefore, as accurately describing the political attitude
which the Ku Klux proposed and desired to maintain. Every man who became a member of the Klan
really took an oath to support the Constitution of the United States.

This last clause was the result of the infamous and barbarous legislation of that day. On the
3rd of June, 1865, the Thirty-fourth General Assembly of Tennessee revived the sedition law
and restricted the right of suffrage.[39] A negro militia, ignorant and brutal, were afterwards
put over the State, and spread terror throughout its borders. Men felt that they had no security
for life, liberty, or property. They were persecuted if they dared to complain. It was no strange
thing if they resorted to desperate measures for protection. The emergency was desperate. Taking
all the circumstances and aggravations into consideration one cannot but be surprised that
men so persecuted and oppressed remained so moderate and forbearing.

The legislation of the Nashville Convention of Ku Klux bears internal evidence of what we know
from other sources to be true. Whilst devising measures for protection to life and property,
and for the resistance of lawlessness and oppression, whether from irresponsible parties or
from those who professed to be acting legally and under cover of authority, they were anxious
also to control the Klan itself and to keep it within what they conceived to be safe limits.

Up to this time the majority had shown a fair appreciation of the responsibilities of their
self-imposed task of preserving social order. But under any circumstances the natural tendency
of an organization such as this is to violence and crime--much more under such circumstances
as those then prevailing.

Excesses had been committed. Whether justly so or not, they were credited to the Klan. And
it was foreseen and feared that if such things continued or increased the hostility of State
and Federal Governments would be kindled against the Klan and active measures taken to suppress
it. The hope was entertained that the legislations taken by the convention and the reorganization
would not only enable the Klan to enact its role as Regulators with greater success, but would
keep its members within the prescribed limits, and so guard against the contingencies referred
to. They desired on the one hand, to restrain and control their own members; on the other to
correct evils and promote order in society; and to do the latter solely by utilizing for this
purpose the means and methods originally employed for amusement. In each direction the success
was but partial, as will be told presently.

By the reorganization no material change was made in the methods of the Klan's operations.
Some of the old methods were slightly modified; a few new features were added. The essential
features of mystery, secrecy and grotesqueness were retained, and steps were taken with a view
to deepening and intensifying the impressions already made upon the public mind. They attempted
to push to the extreme limits of illustration the power of the mysterious over the minds of men.

Henceforth they courted publicity as assiduously as they had formerly seemed to shun it. They
appeared at different points at the same time, and always when and where they were the least
expected. Devices were multiplied to deceive people in regard to their numbers and everything
else, and to play upon the fears of the superstitious.

As it was now the policy of the Klan to appear in public, an order was issued by the Grand
Dragon of the Realm of Tennessee to the Grand Giants of the Provinces for a general parade
in the capital town of each Province on the night of the 4th of July, 1867. It will be sufficient
for this narrative to describe that parade as witnessed by the citizens of Pulaski. Similar
scenes were enacted at many other places.

On the morning of the 4th of July, 1867, the citizens of Pulaski found the sidewalks thickly
strewn with slips of paper bearing the printed words:[40] "The Ku Klux will parade the streets
to-night." This announcement created great excitement. The people supposed that their curiosity,
so long baffled, would now be gratified. They were confident that this parade would at least
afford them the opportunity to find out who were the Ku Klux.

Soon after nightfall the streets were lined with an expectant and excited throng of people.
Many came from the surrounding country. The members of the Klan in the county left their homes
in the afternoon and traveled alone or in squads of two or three, with their paraphernalia
carefully concealed. If questioned, they answered that they were going to Pulaski to see the
Ku Klux parade. After nightfall they assembled at designated points near the four main roads
leading into town. Here they donned their robes and disguises and put covers of gaudy materials
on their horses. A skyrocket sent up from some point in the town was the signal to mount and
move. The different companies met and passed each other on the public square in perfect silence;
the discipline appeared to be admirable.[41] Not a word was spoken. Necessary orders were given
by means of the whistles. In single file, in death-like stillness, with funeral slowness, they
marched and counter-marched throughout the town. While the column was headed North on one street
it was going South on another. By crossing over in opposite directions the lines were kept
up in almost unbroken continuity. The effect was to create the impression of vast numbers.
This marching and counter-marching was kept up for about two hours, and the Klan departed as
noiselessly as they came. The public were more than ever mystified. Curiosity had not been
satisfied, as it was expected it would be. The efforts of the most curious and cunning to find
out who were Ku Klux failed. One gentleman from the country, a great lover of horses, who claimed
to know every horse in the county, was confident that he would be able to identify the riders
by the horses. With this purpose in view, he remained in town to witness the parade. But, as
we have said, the horses were disguised as well as the riders. Determined not to be baffled,
during a halt of the column he lifted the cover of a horse that was near him--the rider offering
no objection--and recognized his own steed and saddle upon which he had ridden into town. The
town people were on the alert also to see who of the young men of the town would be with the
Ku Klux. All of them, almost without exception, were marked, mingling freely and conspicuously
with the spectators. Those of them who were members of the Klan did not go into the parade.

This demonstration had the effect for which it was designed. Perhaps the greatest illusion
produced by it was in regard to the numbers participating in it. Reputable citizens--men of
cool and accurate judgment--were confident that the number was not less than three thousand.
Others, whose imaginations were more easily wrought upon, were quite certain there were ten
thousand. The truth is, that the number of Ku Klux in the parade did not exceed four hundred.
This delusion in regard to numbers prevailed wherever the Ku Klux appeared. It illustrates
how little the testimony of even an eye-witness is worth in regard to anything which makes
a deep impression on him by reason of its mysteriousness.

The Klan had a large membership; it exerted a vast, terrifying and wholesome power; but its
influence was never at any time dependent on, or proportioned to, its membership. It was in
the mystery in which the comparatively few enshrouded themselves. Gen. Forrest, before the
Investigating Committee, placed the number of Ku Klux in Tennessee at 40,000,[42] and in the
entire South at 550,000. This was with him only a guessing estimate.[43] Careful investigation
leads to the conclusion that he overshoots the mark in both cases. It is an error to suppose
that the entire male population of the South were Ku Klux, or that even a majority of them
were privy to its secrets and in sympathy with its extremest measures. To many of them, perhaps
to a majority, the Ku Klux Klan was as vague, impersonal and mysterious as to the people of
the North, or of England. The gown was fastened by a draw-string over the top of the wearer's
head. Over this was worn an artificial skull made of a large gourd or of pasteboard. This with
the hat could be readily removed, and the man would then appear to be headless. Such tricks
gave rise to the belief--still prevalent among the negroes--that the Ku Klux could take themselves
all to pieces whenever they wanted to.

Some of the Ku Klux carried skeleton hands. These were made of bone or wood with a handle long
enough to be held in the hand, which was concealed by the gown sleeve. The possessor of one
of these was invariably of a friendly turn and offered to shake hands with all he met, with
what effect may be readily imagined.

A trick of frequent perpetration in the country was for a horseman, spectral and ghostly looking,
to stop before the cabin of some negro needing a wholesome impression and call for a bucket
of water. If a dipper or gourd was brought it was declined, and the bucket full of water demanded.
As if consumed by raging thirst the horseman grasped it and pressed it to his lips. He held
it there till every drop of the water was poured into a gum or oiled sack concealed beneath
the Ku Klux robe. Then the empty bucket was returned to the amazed negro with the remark: "That's
good. It is the first drink of water I have had since I was killed at Shiloh." Then a few words
of counsel as to future behavior made an impression not easily forgotten or likely to be disregarded.

Under ordinary circumstances such devices are unjustifiable. But in the peculiar state of things
then existing they served a good purpose. It was not only better to deter the negroes from
theft and other lawlessness in this way than to put them in the penitentiary; but it was the
only way, at this time, by which they could be controlled. The jails would not contain them.
The courts could not or would not try them. The policy of the Klan all the while was to deter
men from wrongdoing. It was only in rare, exceptional cases, and these the most aggravated,
that it undertook to punish.[46]

which masqueraded at night in grotesque and grewsome character called the Ku Klux Klan. Always
silent and mysterious, mounted on horses, they swept noiselessly by in the darkness with gleaming
death's heads, skeletons and chains. It struck terror into the heart of the evil-doer, while

CHAPTER IV.

THE DECLINE.

For a while after the reorganization of the Klan, those concerned for its welfare and right
conduct congratulated themselves that all was now well. Closer organization and stricter official
supervision had a restraining influence upon the members. Many things seemed to indicate that
the future work of the Klan would be wholly good.

These hopes were rudely shattered. Ere long official supervision grew less rigid or was less
regarded. The membership was steadily increasing. Among the new material added were some bad
men who could not be--at least were not--controlled.

In the winter and spring of 1867 and 1868 many things were done by members, or professed members,
of the Klan, which were the subject of universal regret and condemnation. In many ways the
grave censure of those who had hitherto been friendly to it was evoked against the Klan, and
occasion, long sought for, was given its enemies to petition the intervention of the government
to suppress it. The end came rapidly. We must now trace the causes which wrought the decay
and downfall of the "Invisible Empire."

In regard to the doings of the Ku Klux two extreme positions have been advocated. On the one
hand, it is asserted that the Ku Klux committed no outrages. On the other, that they were the
authors of all the depredations committed by masked and disguised men in the Southern States
from 1865 to 1869. The truth lies between these two extremes. Great outrages were committed
by bands of disguised men during those years of lawlessness and oppression. And the fact must
be admitted that some of these outrages were committed, if not by the order and approbation
of the Klan, at least by men who were members of it.[47]

The thoughtful reader will readily understand how this came about.

There was a cause which naturally and almost necessarily produced the result. Men of the character
of the majority of those who composed the Klan do not disregard their own professed principles
and violate self-assumed obligations without cause. We have seen that the Klan was in the main
composed of the very best men in the country--peaceable, law-loving and law-abiding men--men
of good habits and character--men of property and intelligence.

We have seen that the organization had no political significance; they expressly and in solemn
secret compact declared their allegiance to the constitution and all constitutional laws, and
pledged themselves to aid in the administration of all such laws. To see such men defying law
and creating disorder, is a sight singular enough to awake inquiry as to the causes which had
been at work upon them. The transformation of the Ku Klux Klan, from a band of regulators,
honestly trying to preserve peace and order, into the body of desperate men who, in 1869, convulsed
the country and set at defiance the mandates of both State and Federal governments, is greater
than the transformation which we have already traced.

In both cases there were causes at work adequate to the results produced; causes from which,
as remarked before, the results followed naturally and necessarily.

These have never been fully and fairly stated. They may be classed under three general heads:
(1). Unjust charges. (2). Misapprehension of the nature and objects of the order on the part
of those not members of it. (3). Unwise and over-severe legislation.

As has already been pointed out, the order contained within itself, by reason of the methods
practiced, sources of weakness. The devices and disguises by which the Klan deceived outsiders
enabled all who were so disposed, even its own members, to practice deception on the Klan itself.
It placed in the hands of its own members the facility to do deeds of violence for the gratification
of personal feeling, and have them credited to the Klan. To evilly-disposed men membership
in the Klan was an inducement to wrongdoing. It presented to all men a dangerous temptation,
which, in certain contingencies at any time likely to arise, it required a considerable amount
of moral robustness to resist. Many did not withstand it. And deeds of violence were done by
men who were Ku Klux, but who, while acting under cover of their connection with the Klan,
were not under its orders. But because these men were Ku Klux, the Klan had to bear the odium
of wrongdoing.[48]

In addition to this, the very class which the Klan proposed to hold in check and awe into good
behavior, soon became wholly unmanageable. Those who had formerly committed depredations to
be laid to the charge of the negroes, after a brief interval of good behavior, assumed the
guise of Ku Klux and returned to their old ways, but with less boldness and more caution, showing
the salutary impression which the Klan had made upon them. In some cases the negroes played
Ku Klux. Outrages were committed by masked men in regions far remote from any Ku Klux organizations.
The parties engaged took pains to assert that they were Ku Klux, which the members of the Klan
never did. This was evidence that these parties were simply aping Ku Klux disguises. The proof
on this point is ample and clear. After the passage of the Anti Ku Klux Statute by the State
of Tennessee, several instances occurred of parties being arrested in Ku Klux disguises; but
in every instance they proved to be either negroes or "radical" Brownlow Republicans. This
occurred so often that the statute was allowed by the party in power to become a dead letter
before its repeal. It bore too hard on "loyal" men when enforced.

The same thing occurred in Georgia and other States. (See testimony of General Gordon and others
before the Investigating Committee.)

No single instance occurred of the arrest of a masked man who proved to be--when stripped of
his disguises--a Ku Klux.

But it came to pass that all the disorder done in the country was charged upon the Ku Klux,
because done under disguises which they had invented and used. The Klan had no way in which
to disprove or refute the charges. They felt that it was hard to be charged with violence of
which they were innocent. At the same time they felt that it was natural, and, under the circumstances,
not wholly unjust that this should be the case. They had assumed the office of Regulators.
It was therefore due society, due themselves, and due the Government, which, so far, had not
molested them, that they should, at least, not afford the lawless classes facilities for the
commission of excesses greater than any they had hitherto indulged in, and above all, that
they should restrain their own members from lawlessness.

The Klan felt all this; and in its efforts to relieve itself of the stigma thus incurred, it
acted in some cases against the offending parties with a severity well merited, no doubt, but
unjustifiable.[49] As is frequently the case they were carried beyond the limits of prudence
and right by a hot zeal for self-vindication against unjust aspersions.

They felt that the charge of wrong was unfairly brought against them. To clear themselves of
the charge they did worse wrong than that alleged against them.

The Klan from the first shrouded itself in deepest mystery; out of this fact grew trouble not
at first apprehended. They wished people not to understand. They tried to keep them profoundly
ignorant. The result was that the Klan and its objects were wholly misunderstood and misinterpreted.
Many who joined the Klan and many who did not, were certain it contemplated something far more
important than its overt acts gave evidence of. Some were sure it meant treason and revolution.
The negroes and the whites whose consciences made them the subjects of guilty fears, were sure
it boded no good to them.

When the first impressions of awe and terror which the Klan had inspired, to some extent, wore
off, a feeling of intense hostility towards the Ku Klux followed. This feeling was the more
bitter because founded, not on overt acts which the Ku Klux had done, but on vague fears and
surmises as to what they intended to do. Those who entertained such fears were in some cases
impelled by them to become the aggressors. They attacked the Ku Klux before receiving from
them any provocation. The negroes formed organizations of a military character and drilled
by night, and even appeared in the day armed and threatening. The avowed purpose of these organizations
was "to make war upon and exterminate the Ku Klux." On several occasions the Klan was fired
into. The effect of such attacks was to provoke counter hostility from the Klan, and so there
was irritation and counter-irritation, till, in some places, the state of things was little
short of open warfare. In some respects it was worse; the parties wholly misunderstood each
other. Each party felt that its cause was the just one. Each justified its deed by the provocation.

The Ku Klux, intending wrong, as they believed, to no one, were aggrieved that acts which they
had not done should be charged to them; and motives which they did not entertain imputed to
them and outraged that they should be molested and assaulted. The other party satisfied that
they were acting in self-defense felt fully justified in assaulting them, and so each goaded
the other on from one degree of exasperation to another.

The following extracts from a general order of the Grand Dragon of the Realm of Tennessee will
illustrate the operation of both these causes. It was issued in the fall of the year 1868.
It shows what were the principles and objects which the Klan still professed, and it also shows
how it was being forced away from them:

                                       HEADQUARTERS REALM NO. 1,}
                                      DREADFUL ERA, BLACK EPOCH,}

                                                  DREADFUL HOUR.}

    General Order No. 1.

    The G. D. [Grand Dragon] regrets the necessity of such an order.
    But this Klan shall not be outraged and interfered with by
    lawless negroes and meaner white men, who do not and never have
    understood our purposes.

    In the first place this Klan is not an institution of violence,
    lawlessness and cruelty; it is not lawless; it is not
    aggressive; it is not military; it is not revolutionary.

    It is, essentially, originally and inherently a protective
    organization. It proposes to execute law instead of resisting
    it; and to protect all good men, whether white or black, from
    the outrages and atrocities of bad men of both colors, who have
    been for the past three years a terror to society, and an injury
    to us all.

    The blacks seem to be impressed with the belief that this Klan
    is especially their enemy. We are not the enemy of the blacks,
    as long as they behave themselves, make no threats upon us, and
    do not attack or interfere with us.

    But if they make war upon us they must abide the awful
    retribution that will follow.

    This Klan, while in its peaceful movements, and disturbing no
    one, has been fired into three times. This will not be endured
    any longer; and if it occurs again, and the parties be
    discovered, a remorseless vengeance will be wreaked upon them.

    We reiterate that we are for peace and law and order. No man,
    white or black, shall be molested for his political sentiments.
    This Klan is not a political party; it is not a military party;
    it is a protective organization, and will never use violence
    except in resisting violence.

    Outrages have been perpetrated by irresponsible parties in the
    name of this Klan. Should such parties be apprehended, they will
    be dealt with in a manner to insure us future exemption from
    such imposition. These impostors have, in some instances,
    whipped negroes. This is wrong! wrong! It is denounced by this
    Klan as it must be by all good and humane men.

    The Klan now, as in the past, is prohibited from doing such
    things. We are striving to protect all good, peaceful,
    well-disposed and law-abiding men, whether white or black.

    The G. D. deems this order due to the public, due to the Klan,
    and due to those who are misguided and misinformed. We,
    therefore, request that all newspapers who are friendly to law,
    and peace, and the public welfare, will publish the same.

                              By order of the G. D., Realm No. 1.
                              By the Grand Scribe.

This order doubtless expresses the principles which the Klan, as a body, was honestly trying
to maintain. It also illustrates how they were driven to violate them by the very earnestness
and vehemence with which they attempted to maintain them.

The question naturally arises, Why, under the embarrassing circumstances, did not the Klan
disband and close its operations?[50] The answer is, that the members felt that there was now
more reasons than ever for the Klan's existence. They felt that they ought not to abandon their
important and needful work because they encountered unforeseen difficulties in accomplishing
it. It is an illustration of the fatuity which sometimes marks the lives of men that they did
not perceive what seems perfectly clear and plain to others. Nothing is more certain than that
a part of the evils which the Klan was combating at this period of its history grew out of
their own methods, and might be expected to continue as long as the Klan existed. Men are not
always wise. But even in cases where their conduct does not permit of vindication and excuse,
justice requires that a fair and truthful statement be made of the temptations and embarrassments
which surrounded them. Placing all the circumstances before us fully, who of us is prepared
to say that we would have acted with more wisdom and discretion than these men?

Matters grew worse and worse, till it was imperatively necessary that there should be interference
on the part of the Government. In September, 1868, the Legislature of Tennessee, in obedience
to the call of Governor Brownlow, assembled in extra session and passed a most stringent and
bloody anti-Ku Klux statute.[51] This was the culmination of a long series of the most infamous
legislations which ever disgraced a statute book.

It began in 1865, as we have seen, in the passage of the alien and sedition act, and grew worse
and worse till the passage of the anti-Ku Klux statute in 1868. Sixteen years have passed since
then, and many into whose hands this book will come have never seen the "Anti-Ku Klux Law."
We quote it entire, to show the character of the legislation of those times as well as for
the sake of its bearing on the matter in hand:

    SEC. 1. Be it enacted, by the General Assembly of Tennessee,
    That if any person or persons shall unite with, associate with,
    promote or encourage any secret organization of persons who
    shall prowl through the country or towns of this State, by day
    or by night, disguised or otherwise, for the purpose of
    disturbing the peace, or alarming the peaceable citizens of any
    portion of this State, on conviction by any tribunal of this
    State, shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars,
    imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than five years, and
    shall be rendered infamous.

    SEC. 2. Be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of
    all the courts in this State, before the impaneling of any grand
    jury or petit jury in any cause whatever, to inquire of the
    juror, on oath, whether he shall be associated in any way
    obnoxious to the first section of this act; and if such juror
    shall decline to give a voluntary answer, or shall answer
    affirmatively, such persons shall be disqualified as a juror in
    any case in any court in this State.

    SEC. 3. Be it further enacted, That, for the purpose of
    facilitating the execution of the provisions of this act, it
    shall be the duty of the Prosecuting Attorneys of this State or
    grand jurors, or either of them, to summons or cause to be
    summoned, any persons he shall have a well-grounded belief has
    any knowledge of such organization as described by the first
    section of this act, and if any person shall fail or refuse to
    obey such summons, or shall appear and refuse to testify, such
    persons so summoned shall suffer the penalty imposed by the
    first section of this act; and if such witness shall avoid the
    service of said subpoena or summons, the sheriff, or other
    officer, shall return such fact on said process, when the court
    shall order a copy of said process to be left at the last place
    of residence of such persons sought to be summoned; and if such
    person shall fail to appear according to the command of said
    process, said court shall enter a judgment nisi against such
    person for the sum of five hundred dollars, for which sci. fa.
    shall issue, as in other cases of forfeiture of subpoena.

    SEC. 4. Be it further enacted, That no prosecutor shall be
    required on any indictment under the provisions of this act; and
    all the courts of the State shall give a remedial construction
    to the same; and that no presentment or indictment shall be
    quashed, or declared insufficient for want of form.

    SEC. 5. Be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of
    all the courts of this State, at every term, for two years from
    and after the passage of this act, to call before it all the
    officers thereof, who shall be sworn, and have this act read or
    explained to them; and the court shall ask said officers if they
    shall have any knowledge of any person of the State, or out of
    it, that shall be guilty of any of the offenses contained in
    this act, and that, if at any time they shall come to such
    knowledge, or shall have a well-grounded belief that any person
    or persons shall be guilty of a violation of this act or any of
    its provisions, that they will immediately, inform the
    Prosecuting Attorney for the State thereof; and if such
    Prosecuting Attorney, upon being so informed, shall fail,
    refuse, or neglect to prosecute such person or persons so
    informed on, he shall be subject to the same penalties imposed
    by the first section of this act, and shall be stricken from the
    roll of attorneys in said court.

    SEC. 6. Be it further enacted, That if any officer, or other
    person, shall inform any other person that he or she is to be
    summoned as a witness under any of the provisions of this act,
    or any other statute or law of this State, with the intent and
    for the purpose of defeating any of the provisions of this act,
    or any criminal law of this State; or if any officer, clerk,
    sheriff or constable shall refuse or fail to perform any of the
    duties imposed by this act, upon conviction, shall suffer the
    penalties by the first section of this act, and shall be
    disqualified from holding office in this State for two years.

    SEC. 7. Be it further enacted, That if any person shall
    voluntarily inform on any person guilty of any of the provisions
    of this act, upon conviction such informant shall be entitled
    and receive one-half of the fine imposed; and if any officer,
    three-fourths.

    SEC. 8. Be it further enacted, That if any person, guilty of
    any of the provisions or offenses enumerated in this act, that
    shall appear before any jury or prosecuting officer of the
    State, and shall inform him or them of any offense committed by
    any person or persons against the criminal laws of this State,
    such person or witness shall not be bound to answer to any
    charge for the violation of any provisions of any law about
    which such person or witness shall be examined; and the court
    shall protect such witness from any prosecution whatever.

    SEC. 9. Be it further enacted, That where any process shall be
    issued against the person of any citizen in any county of this
    State, for any violation of the provisions of this act, and such
    shall be returned not executed, for any cause whatever, by the
    sheriff or other officer, to the court from which it was issued,
    with an affidavit appended thereto, plainly setting forth the
    reason for the non-execution of such process, then it shall be
    the duty of the clerk, without delay, to issue an alias capias
    to the same county, if the home of the defendant shall be in
    said county, either in part or in whole, when said sheriff or
    other officer shall give notice to the inhabitants of said
    county by posting such notice at the court-house of said county,
    of the existence of said capias; and if the inhabitants of such
    county shall permit such defendant to be or to live in said
    county, in part or in whole, the inhabitants shall be subject to
    an assessment of not less than five hundred dollars, nor more
    than five thousand dollars, at the discretion of the court,
    which said assessment shall be made in the following manner,
    to-wit: When the sheriff or other officer shall return his
    alias capias, showing that said defendant is an inhabitant of
    said county, in part or in whole, and that the citizens thereof
    have failed or refused to arrest said defendant, which every
    citizen is hereby authorized to do or perform. Said court shall
    order sci. fa. to issue to the proper officer to make known to
    the chairman, judge, or other presiding officer of the County
    Court, to appear and show cause why final judgment should not
    have been entered up accordingly; which, if any County Court
    fails or refuses to do and perform, any judge, in vacation,
    shall grant a mandamus to compel said County Court to assess
    and collect said assessment, to be paid into the State treasury
    for the benefit of the school fund; provided, said assessment
    shall not be made of the sheriff or other officer, upon the
    return of the original, or alias writs, show cause why the
    same cannot be executed, which may be done by his affidavit and
    two respectable witnesses known to the court as such.

    SEC. 10. Be it further enacted, That all the inhabitants in
    this State shall be authorized to arrest any person defendant,
    under the provisions of this act, in any county in this State
    without process.

    SEC. 11. Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons
    shall write, publish, advise, entreat or persuade, privately or
    publicly, any class of persons, or any individual, to resist any
    of the laws of this State calculated to molest or disturb the
    good people and peaceable citizens of the State, such persons
    shall be subject to the penalties of the first section of this
    act; and if an attorney at law, he shall be stricken from the
    roll of attorneys and be prevented from practicing in any court
    in this State.

    SEC. 12. Be it further enacted, That if any person shall make
    threats against any elector or person authorized to exercise the

    this State, they shall be subject to the penalties inflicted by
    the first section of this act.

    SEC. 13. Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons
    shall attempt to break up any election in this State, or advise

    act; and the attorney of the State in all convictions under the
    provisions of this act, shall be entitled to a tax fee of one
    hundred dollars, to be taxed in the bill of costs, and to be
    paid by the defendant. And the attorney prosecuting for the
    State shall keep all information given him a secret, unless it
    shall be necessary, in the opinion of the court, that the same
    should be made public.

    SEC. 14. Be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of
    all the judges in this State to read this act to the grand
    juries, and give it especially in charge to said juries.

    SEC. 15. Be it further enacted, That the treasurer of this
    State shall not be authorized to pay any judge in this State any

    this act, until such judge or other officer shall have filed
    with the comptroller or treasurer an affidavit plainly setting
    forth that he has fully complied with the provisions of this
    act.

    SEC. 16. Be it further enacted, That if any person or citizen
    of this State shall voluntarily feed, or lodge, or entertain, or
    conceal in the woods, or elsewhere, any offender known to such
    person to be charged with any criminal offense under this act,
    such person shall suffer the penalty prescribed by the first
    section of this act; provided, that this section shall not apply
    to persons who, under the ancient law, might feed or conceal the
    party charged.

    SEC. 17. Be it further enacted, That if any person, guilty of
    any of the offenses enumerated in this act, shall have, own or
    possess any real estate held by deed, or grant, or entry, or by

    commission of the offense, which fact may be found by the jury
    trying the cause, or any other jury impaneled for that purpose;
    and if in the opinion of the court the defendant has evaded the
    law, the jury shall find such fact, and the estate of the
    defendant shall be made liable for the costs of the State; and
    there shall be no limitation to the recovery of the same.

    SEC. 18. Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons

    State by this act.

    SEC. 19. Be it further enacted, That if any person shall

    SEC. 20. Be it further enacted, That in addition to the oath
    prescribed by the constitution and oath of office, every public
    officer shall swear that he has never been a member of the
    organization known as the Ku Klux Klan, or other disguised body

    neither directly nor indirectly aided, encouraged, supported, or
    in any manner countenanced said organization.

    SEC. 21. Be it further enacted, That the attorneys or

    will, the sum of ten thousand dollars; and it shall be lawful
    for the person so assailed to kill the assailant. For killing
    any individual in the night twenty thousand dollars; provided,
    such person killed was peaceable at that time. That all other
    injuries shall be assessed by the court and jury in proportion;
    and the court trying said causes may grant as many new trials as
    may, in his opinion, be necessary to attain the end of justice.

    SEC. 23. Be it further enacted, That all persons present, and
    not giving immediate information on the offenders, shall be
    regarded as guilty of a misdemeanor against the law, and shall
    be punished accordingly.

    SEC. 24. Be it further enacted, That it shall not be lawful
    for any persons to publish any proffered or pretended order of
    said secret, unlawful clans; and any person convicted under any
    of the provisions of this act, shall not claim, hold, or possess
    any property, real or personal, exempt from execution, fine,
    penalty or costs, under this act; provided, that nothing herein
    contained shall be so construed as to prevent or exempt any
    person heretofore guilty of any of the offenses herein contained
    from prosecution under the law as it now stands. This act to
    take effect from after its passage.[52]

The same legislature passed a bill authorizing the Governor to organize, equip and call into
active service, at his discretion, a volunteer force, to be known as the Tennessee State Guards;
to be composed of one or more regiments from each congressional district of the State; provided
always that said Tennessee State Guards shall be composed of loyal men.

And it was further provided by the "Militia Law," that upon the representation of "ten Union
men, or three Justices of the Peace in any county in the State," that the presence of these
troops were needed, that the Governor might declare martial law in such counties, and send
thither troops in such numbers as, in his judgment, were necessary for the preservation of
peace and order. And it was provided that the expense of these troops to the State should be
collected from the counties where they were quartered.

The reader has now some insight into the character of the legislation direct against the Ku
Klux. He will not only note the general severity and harshness of it, but the following features
in particular:

(1). The anti-Ku Klux statute was ex post facto, as expressly declared by Section 24 of it.
(2). It presented no way in which a man could relieve himself from liability to it, except
by turning informer, and as an inducement to do this a large bribe was offered. (3). It encouraged
strife, by making every inhabitant of the State an officer extraordinary with power "to arrest
without process" when he had ground to suspect. (4). It must be remembered that in those days
in Tennessee "to be loyal" had a very limited meaning. It meant simply to be a subservient
tool and supporter of Governor Brownlow. If a man was not that, no matter what his past record,
or what his political opinion, he was not "loyal." (5). While the law professed to be aimed
at the suppression of all lawlessness, it was not so construed and enforced by the party in
power. The "Union" or "Loyal" League was never molested, though this organization met frequently,
and its members appeared by day and by night, armed, threatening and molesting the life and
property of as peaceable and quiet citizens as any in the State. No attempt was ever made to
arrest men except in Ku Klux disguises. But as before remarked there is no instance on record
of a Ku Klux being arrested, tried and convicted. Invariably the party arrested while depredating
as Ku Klux turned out to be, when stripped of their disguises, "loyal" men.

In some sections of the State a perfect reign of terror followed this anti-Ku Klux statute.
The members of the Klan were now in the attitude of men fighting for life and liberty. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of them were not lawbreakers, and did not desire to be. There had been no
law against association with the Klan; they had conceived and done no wrong during their connection
with it. They had had no participation in or knowledge of the excesses in which some of the
Klan had indulged or were charged with having indulged in. But now their previous connection
with the Klan was made a penal offense; and they had no hope except on terms which to men of
honor and right principle were more odious than death.

These men were made infamous, made liable to fine and imprisonment, exposed to arrest without
process by any malicious negro or mean white man; and even their wives and children were outlawed
and exposed to the same indignities; and it is no strange thing if they were driven to the
very verge of desperation. It is not denied that they did many things for which the world has
been exceedingly slow to accept apology or excuse. But history is challenged to furnish an
instance of a people bearing gross wrong and brutal outrage perpetrated in the name of law
and loyalty with patience, forbearance or forgiveness, comparable to that exhibited by the
people of the Southern States, and especially of Tennessee, during what is called the "Reconstruction
period," and since.

There may be in their conduct some things to regret, and some to condemn; but he who gets a
full understanding of their surroundings, social, civil and political, if he is not incapable
of noble sentiment, will also find many things to awaken his sympathy and call forth his admiration.

revenge for personal dislikes or personal animosities, and in this way many outrages were perpetrated,
ultimately resulting in casting so much well-deserved odium on the whole concern that about
the year 1870 there was almost a universal collapse; all the good and brave men abandoning
it in disgust. Many outrages were committed in the name of Ku Klux that really were done by
irresponsible parties who never belonged to the Klan."--Ryland Randolph.

CHAPTER V.

DISBANDMENT.

On the 20th day of February, 1869, Governor Brownlow resigned his position as Governor to take
the seat in the United States Senate, to which he had been elected. The last paper to which
he affixed his signature as Governor of Tennessee, proclaimed martial law in certain counties,
and ordered troops to be sent thither. This proclamation was dated February 20, 1869. In a
short while it was followed by a proclamation from the "Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire"
to his subjects.

This proclamation recited the legislation directed against the Klan, and stated that the order
had now, in large measure, accomplished the objects of its existence. At a time when the civil
law afforded inadequate protection to life and property, when robbery and lawlessness of every
description were unrebuked, when all the better elements of society were in constant dread
for the safety of their property, persons and families, the Klan had afforded protection and
security to many firesides, and, in many ways contributed to the public welfare. But greatly
to the regret of all good citizens, some members of the Klan had violated positive orders;
others, under the name and disguises of the organization, had assumed to do acts of violence,
for which the Klan was held responsible. The Grand Wizard had been invested with the power
to determine questions of paramount importance to the interests of the order. Therefore, in
the exercise of that power, the Grand Wizard declared that the organization heretofore known
as the Ku Klux Klan was dissolved and disbanded.

Members were directed to burn all regalia and paraphernalia of every description, and to desist
from any further assemblies or acts as Ku Klux.[53] The members of the Klan were counseled
in the future as heretofore, to assist all good people of the land in maintaining and upholding
the civil laws, and in putting down lawlessness. This proclamation was directed to all Realms,
Dominions, Provinces and "Dens" in "the Empire." It is reasonably certain that there were portions
of the Empire never reached by it. The Klan was widely scattered and the facilities for communication
exceedingly poor. The Grand Wizard was a citizen of Tennessee. Under the statute just now quoted
newspapers were forbidden to publish anything emanating from the Klan. So that there was no
way in which this proclamation could be generally disseminated.

Where it was promulgated, obedience to it was prompt and implicit. Whether obeyed or not, this
proclamation terminated the Klan's organized existence as decisively and completely as General
Lee's last general order, on the morning of the 10th of April, 1865, disbanded the army of
Northern Virginia.

When the office of Grand Wizard was created and its duties defined, it was explicitly provided
that he should have "the power to determine questions of paramount importance, and his decision
shall be final." To continue the organization or to disband it was such a question. He decided
in favor of disbanding, and so ordered. Therefore the Ku Klux Klan had no organized existence
after March, 1869.[54]

The report of the Congressional Investigating Committee contains some disreputable history,
which belongs to a later date, and is attributed to the Klan, but not justly so. For several
years, after March, 1869, the papers reported and commented on "Ku Klux outrages" committed
at various points. The authors of these outrages may have acted in the name of the Klan, and
under its disguises; it may be that in some cases they were men who had been Ku Klux. But it
cannot be charged that they were acting by the authority of an order which had formally disbanded.
They were acting on their own responsibility.

Thus lived, so died, this strange order. Its birth was an accident; its growth was a comedy;
its death a tragedy. It owed its existence wholly to the anomalous condition of social and
civil affairs in the South during the years immediately succeeding the unfortunate contest
in which so many brave men in blue and gray fell, martyrs to their convictions.

There never was, before or since, a period of our history when such an order could have lived.
May there never be again!

    the same.

    clops, the Grand Magi, and the Grand Monk,)
    and who shall have investigated his antecedents

    ing, with his right hand raised to heaven, and
    his left hand resting on the Bible:

    PRELIMINARY OBLIGATION.

    "I ---- solemnly swear or affirm that I will
    never reveal any thing that I may this day (or
    night) learn concerning the Order of the * * *,
    and that I will true answer make to such interrog-
    atories as may be put to me touching my com-
    petency for admission into the same. So help
    me God."

    INTERROGATORIES TO BE ASKED:

    1st. Have you ever been rejected, upon appli-
    cation for membership in the * * *, or have you
    ever been expelled from the same?

    2d. Are you now, or have you ever been, a
    member of the Radical Republican party, or
    either of the organizations known as the "Loyal
    League" and the "Grand Army of the Re-
    public?".

    3d. Are you opposed to the principles and
    policy of the Radical party, and to the Loyal
    League, and the Grand Army of the Republic,
    so far as you are informed of the character and
    purposes of those organizations?

    4th. Did you belong to the Federal army
    during the late war, and fight against the South
    during the existence of the same?

    5th. Are you opposed to negro equality, both
    social and political?

    6th. Are you in favor of a white man's gov-
    ernment in this country?

    [Header: Nemo tenetur seipsum accusare. 20]

    and a Government of equitable laws instead of a
    Government of violence and oppression?

    8th. Are you in favor of maintaining the Con-
    stitutional rights of the South?

    9th. Are you in favor of the re-enfranchise-
    ment and emancipation of the white men of
    the South, and the restitution of the Southern
    people to all their rights, alike proprietary, civil,
    and political?

    10th. Do you believe in the inalienable right
    of self-preservation of the people against the ex-
    ercise of arbitrary and unlicensed power?

    If the foregoing interrogatories are satisfacto-
    rily answered, and the candidate desires to go
    further (after something of the character and na-
    ture of the Order has thus been indicated to him)
    and to be admitted to the benefits, mysteries,
    secrets and purposes of the Order, he shall then
    be required to take the following final oath or
    obligation. But if said interrogatories are not
    satisfactorily answered, or the candidate declines
    to proceed further, he shall be discharged, after
    being solemnly admonished by the initiating offi-
    cer of the deep secresy to which the oath already
    taken has bound him, and that the extreme pen-
    alty of the law will follow a violation of the same.

    FINAL OBLIGATION.

    "I ---- of my own free will and accord,
    and in the presence of Almighty God, do sol-
    emnly swear or affirm, that I will never reveal to

    [Header: Deo adjuvante, non timendum. 21]

    any one not a member of the Order of the * * *,
    by any intimation, sign, symbol, word or act, or
    in any other manner whatever, any of the secrets,
    signs, grips, pass-words, or mysteries of the Order
    of the * * *, or that I am a member of the same,
    or that I know any one who is a member; and
    that I will abide by the Prescript and Edicts of
    the Order of the * * * So help me God."

    The initiating officer will then proceed to ex-
    plain to the new members the character and ob-
    jects of the Order, and introduce him to the mys-
    teries and secrets of the same; and shall read to
    him this Prescript and the Edicts thereof, or
    present the same to him for personal perusal.

    ARTICLE VIII.

    AMENDMENTS.

    This Prescript or any part or Edicts thereof
    shall never be changed, except by a two-thirds
    vote of the Grand Dragons of the Realms, in
    convention assembled, and at which convention
    the Grand Wizard shall preside and be entitled
    to a vote. And upon the application of a ma-
    jority of the Grand Dragons for that purpose, the
    Grand Wizard shall call and appoint the time
    and place for said convention; which, when as-

    promote the interest, enlarge the utility, and
    more thoroughly effectuate the purposes of the
    Order.

TO THE PUBLIC

K. K. K.

TAKEN BY HABEAS CORPUS.

In silence and secrecy thought has been working, and the benignant efficacies of concealment
speak for themselves. Once again have we been forced by force to use Force. Justice was lame,
and she had to lean upon us. Information being obtained that a "doubting Thomas," the inferior
of nothing, the superior of nothing, and of consequence the equal of nothing, who has neither
eyes to see the scars of oppression, nor ears to hear the cause of humanity, even though he
wears the Judicial silk, had ordered some guilty prisoners from Union to the City of Columbia,
and of injustice and prejudice, for an unfair trial of life; thus clutching at the wheel-spokes
of destiny--then this thing was created and projected; otherwise it would never have been.
We yield to the inevitable and inexorable, and account this the best. "Let not thy right hand
know what thy left hand doeth," is our motto.

We want peace, but this cannot be till justice returns. We want and will have justice, but
this cannot be till the bleeding fight of freedom is fought. Until then the Moloch of Iniquity
will have his victims, even if the Michael of Justice must have his martyrs.

ANOTHER KU KLUX PROCLAMATION.[60]

The following document was discovered on yesterday morning posted on the "legal advertisement"
board hanging at the court-house door. We have examined the original and find it is in the
same handwriting as the one left with the jailer on the night of the late raid on the jail:

HEADQUARTERS K. K. K, DEPARTMENT OF S. C.,

General Orders No. 49.

From the G. G. C., S. S.

We delight not in speech, but there is language which, when meant in earnest, becomes desperate.
We raise the voice of warning, beware! beware! Persons there are, (and not unknown to us,)
who, to gratify some private grudge or selfish end, like Wheeler's men, so called, are executing
their low, paltry, and pitiful designs at the expense, not only of the noble creed we profess
and act, but also to the great trouble and annoyance of their neighbors in various communities.
We stay our hand for once; but if such conduct is frightening away laborers, robbery, and connivance
at the secrets of our organization is repeated, then the mockers must suffer and the traitors
meet their merited doom. We dare not promise what we do not perform. We want no substitutes
or conscripts in our ranks. We can be as generous as we are terrible; but, stand back. We've
said it, and there can be no interference.

               By order of the Grand Chief,
                                             A.O.,
                                     Grand Secretary.

KU KLUX MANIFESTO.[61]

Below we publish a document which we received through the postoffice on Monday last, it having
been dropped into the letter box the previous night, as we are informed by the postmaster.
As to whether or not the paper is genuine, and emanates from the mysterious Ku Klux Klan, we
have no means of knowing, as the handwriting is evidently disguised. Although it is our rule
to decline the publication of all anonymous communications, we have decided to waive the rule
in this instance, and print the document for what it is worth. Here it is in full:

EXTRACT OF MINUTES.

ARTICLE 1. Whereas there are malicious and evil disposed persons, who endeavor to perpetrate
their malice, serve notices, and make threats under the cover of our august name, now we warn
all such bogus organizations that we will not allow of any interference. Stop it.

ARTICLE 2. There shall be no interference with any honest, decent, well-behaved person, whether
white or black; and we cordially invite all such to continue at their appropriate labor, and
they shall be protected therein by the whole power of this organization. But we do intend that
the honest, intelligent white people (the tax payers) of this county shall rule it! We can
no longer put up with negro rule, black bayonets, and a miserably degraded, thievish set of
lawmakers, (God save the mark!) the scum of the earth, the scrapings of creation. We are pledged
to stop it; we are determined to end it, even if we are "forced by force to use force."

ARTICLE 3. Our attention having been called to the letter of one Rose, county treasurer of
York, we brand it as a lie! Our lieutenant was ordered to arrest him, that he might be tried
on alleged charges of incendiarism, (and if convicted he will be executed). But there were
no shots fired at him and no money stolen; that is not in our line, the legislature of the
State of South Carolina have a monopoly in that line.

                          By command of the Chief.
                               Official: K. K. K., A. A. G.

HEADQUARTERS; NINTH DIVISION, S.C.,

Special Orders No. 3, K. K. K.

"Ignorance is the curse of God." For this reason we are determined that the members of the
legislature, the school commissioners, and the county commissioners of Union, shall no longer
officiate. Fifteen (15) days' notice from this date is therefore given and if they, one and
all, do not at once and forever resign their present inhuman, disgraceful, and outrageous rule,
then retributive justice will as surely be used as night follows day.

Also, "An honest man is the noblest work of God." For this reason, if the clerk of the said
board of county commissioners and school commissioners does not immediately renounce and relinquish
his present position, then harsher measures than these will most assuredly and certainly be used.

For confirmation, reference to the orders heretofore published in the Union Weekly Times and
Yorkville Enquirer will more fully and completely show our intention.

                                              A.O.,
                                     Grand Secretary.

March 9, 1871.

THE OATH.[63]

I, before the great immaculate God of heaven and earth, do take and subscribe to the following
sacred binding oath and obligation: I promise and swear that I will uphold and defend the Constitution
of the United States as it was handed down by our forefathers in its original purity. I promise
and swear that I will reject and oppose the principles of the radical party in all its forms,
and forever maintain and contend that intelligent white men shall govern this country. I promise
and pledge myself to assist, according to my pecuniary circumstances, all brothers in distress.
Females, widows, and their households shall ever be specially in my care and protection.

[58] This and the two preceding orders were written by Ryland Randolph and printed in his paper
The Independent Monitor, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

[59] From the Weekly Union Times of Unionville, S.C., February 17, 1871; South Carolina Testimony,
pp. 1003, 1092. The negro militia of South Carolina had killed a man who refused to sell whisky
to them. Several were arrested and imprisoned. A radical judge named Thomas, in Columbia, 60
or 70 miles away and out of the district where the crime was committed, directed that the prisoners
be removed to Columbia for trial. The whites believed that this was done as the first step
toward releasing the criminals. A mob came in, took the men from jail, shot them and gave to
the sheriff the above notice with instructions to have it published in the newspapers.

[60] Weekly Union Times, Unionville, S.C., February 24, 1871; Ku Klux Report, South Carolina
Testimony, p. 1004. The Ku Klux Klan had many imitators, and lawless conduct was often carried
on under the protection of the name and prestige of the Klan. The above warning was meant for
those who had been using the name of the order to cloak evil deeds.

[61] Yorkville Enquirer, Yorkville, S.C., March 9, 1871; South Carolina Testimony, p. 1347.
Another warning to those engaged in lawlessness and using the name of the Klan.

[62] Union Weekly Times, March 17, 1871; South Carolina Testimony, p. 1096. This order illustrates
one method of getting rid of obnoxious officials.

[63] The oath of Ku Klux Klan was not printed. The three versions here given were given from
memory. The similarity is marked, however.

as may be put to me touching my competency for admission into the same. So help me God."

INTERROGATORIES TO BE ASKED:

1st. Have you ever been rejected, upon application for membership in the * * *, or have you
ever been expelled from the same?

of those organizations?

the existence of the same?

5th. Are you opposed to negro equality, both social and political?

6th. Are you in favor of a white man's government in this country?

7th. Are you in favor of Constitutional liberty, and a Government of equitable laws instead

intimation, sign, symbol, word or act, or in any other manner whatever, any of the secrets,
signs, grips, pass-words, or mysteries of the Order of the * * *, or that I am a member of
the same, or that I know any one who is a member; and that I will abide by the Prescript and
