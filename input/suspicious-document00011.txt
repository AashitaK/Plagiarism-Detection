Chapter I

On the west side of Ellen's father's house was a file of Norway spruce-trees, standing with
a sharp pointing of dark boughs towards the north, which gave them an air of expectancy of
progress.

Every morning Ellen, whose bedroom faced that way, looked out with a firm belief that she would
see them on the other side of the stone wall, advanced several paces towards their native land.
She had no doubt of their ability to do so; their roots, projecting in fibrous sprawls from
their trunks, were their feet, and she pictured them advancing with wide trailings, and rustlings
as of green draperies, and a loudening of that dreamy cry of theirs which was to her imagination
a cry of homesickness reminiscent of their old life in the White north. When Ellen had first
heard the name Norway spruce, 'way back in her childhood--so far back, though she was only
seven and a half now, that it seemed to her like a memory from another life--she had asked
her mother to show her Norway on the map, and her strange convictions concerning the trees
had seized her. When her mother said that they had come from that northernmost land of Europe,
Ellen, to whose childhood all truth was naked and literal, immediately conceived to herself
those veritable trees advancing over the frozen seas around the pole, and down through the
vast regions which were painted blue on her map, straight to her father's west yard. There
they stood and sang the songs of their own country, with a melancholy sweetness of absence
and longing, and were forever thinking to return. Ellen felt always a thrill of happy surprise
when she saw them still there of a morning, for she felt that she would miss them sorely when
they were gone. She said nothing of all this to her mother; it was one of the secrets of the
soul which created her individuality and made her a spiritual birth. She was also silent about
her belief concerning the cherry-trees in the east yard. There were three of them, giants of
their kind, which filled the east yard every spring as with mountains of white bloom, breathing
wide gusts of honey sweetness, and humming with bees. Ellen believed that these trees had once
stood in the Garden of Eden, but she never expected to find them missing from the east yard
of a morning, for she remembered the angel with the flaming sword, and she knew how one branch
of the easternmost tree happened to be blasted as if by fire. And she thought that these trees
were happy, and never sighed to the wind as the dark evergreens did, because they had still
the same blossoms and the same fruit that they had in Eden, and so did not fairly know that
they were not there still. Sometimes Ellen, sitting underneath them on a low rib of rock on
a May morning, used to fancy with success that she and the trees were together in that first
garden which she had read about in the Bible.

Sometimes, after one of these successful imaginings, when Ellen's mother called her into the
house she would stare at her little daughter uneasily, and give her a spoonful of a bitter
spring medicine which she had brewed herself. When Ellen's father, Andrew Brewster, came home
from the shop, she would speak to him aside as he was washing his hands at the kitchen sink,
and tell him that it seemed to her that Ellen looked kind of "pindlin'."  Then Andrew, before
he sat down at the dinner-table, would take Ellen's face in his two moist hands, look at her
with anxiety thinly veiled by facetiousness, rub his rough, dark cheek against her soft, white
one until he had reddened it, then laugh, and tell her she looked like a bo'sn. Ellen never
quite knew what her father meant by bo'sn, but she understood that it signified something very
rosy and hearty indeed.

Ellen's father always picked out for her the choicest and tenderest bits of the humble dishes,
and his keen eyes were more watchful of her plate than of his own. Always after Ellen's mother
had said to her father that she thought Ellen looked pindling he was late about coming home
from the shop, and would turn in at the gate laden with paper parcels. Then Ellen would find
an orange or some other delicacy beside her plate at supper. Ellen's aunt Eva, her mother's
younger sister, who lived with them, would look askance at the tidbit with open sarcasm. "You
jest spoil that young one, Fanny," she would say to her sister.

"You can do jest as you are a mind to with your own young ones when you get them, but you can
let mine alone. It's none of your business what her father and me give her to eat; you don't
buy it," Ellen's mother would retort. There was the utmost frankness of speech between the
two sisters. Neither could have been in the slightest doubt as to what the other thought of
her, for it was openly proclaimed to her a dozen times a day, and the conclusion was never
complimentary. Ellen learned very early to form her own opinions of character from her own
intuition, otherwise she would have held her aunt and mother in somewhat slighting estimation,
and she loved them both dearly. They were headstrong, violent-tempered women, but she had an
instinct for the staple qualities below that surface turbulence, which was lashed higher by
every gust of opposition. These two loud, contending voices, which filled the house before
and after shop-hours--for Eva worked in the shop with her brother-in-law--with a duet of discords
instead of harmonies, meant no more to Ellen than the wrangle of the robins in the cherry-trees.
She supposed that two sisters always conversed in that way. She never knew why her father,
after a fiery but ineffectual attempt to quell the feminine tumult, would send her across the
east yard to her grandmother Brewster's, and seat himself on the east door-step in summer,
or go down to the store in the winter. She would sit at the window in her grandmother's sitting-room,
eating peacefully the slice of pound-cake or cooky with which she was always regaled, and listen
to the scolding voices across the yard as she might have listened to any outside disturbance.
She was never sucked into the whirlpool of wrath which seemed to gyrate perpetually in her
home, and wondered at her grandmother Brewster's impatient exclamations concerning the poor
child, and her poor boy, and that it was a shame and a disgrace, when now and then a louder
explosion of wrath struck her ears.

Ellen's grandmother--Mrs. Zelotes Brewster, as she was called, though her husband Zelotes had
been dead for many years--was an aristocrat by virtue of inborn prejudices and convictions,
in despite of circumstances. The neighbors said that Mrs. Zelotes Brewster had always been
high-feeling, and had held up her head with the best. It would have been nearer the truth to
say that she held up her head above the best. No one seeing the erect old woman, in her draperies
of the finest black goods to be bought in the city, could estimate in what heights of thin
upper air of spiritual consequence her head was elevated. She had always a clear sight of the
head-tops of any throng in which she found herself, and queens or duchesses would have been
no exception. She would never have failed to find some stool of superior possessions or traits
upon which to raise herself, and look down upon crown and coronet. When she read in the papers
about the marriage of a New York belle to an English duke, she reflected that the duke could
be by no means as fine a figure of a man as Zelotes had been, and as her son Andrew was, although
both her husband and son had got all their education in the town schools, and had worked in
shoe-shops all their lives. She could have looked at a palace or a castle, and have remained
true to the splendors of her little one-story-and-a-half house with a best parlor and sitting-room,
and a shed kitchen for use in hot weather.

She would not for one instant have been swerved from utmost admiration and faith in her set
of white-and-gold wedding china by the contemplation of Copeland and Royal Sèvres. She would
have pitted her hair-cloth furniture of the ugliest period of household art against all the
Chippendales and First Empire pieces in existence.

As Mrs. Zelotes had never seen any household possessions to equal her own, let alone to surpass
them, she was of the same mind with regard to her husband and his family, herself and her family,
her son and little granddaughter. She never saw any gowns and shawls which compared with hers
in fineness and richness; she never tasted a morsel of cookery which was not as sawdust when
she reflected upon her own; and all that humiliated her in the least, or caused her to feel
in the least dissatisfied, was her son's wife and her family and antecedents.

Mrs. Zelotes Brewster had considered that her son Andrew was marrying immeasurably beneath
him when he married Fanny Loud, of Loudville. Loudville was a humble, an almost disreputably
humble, suburb of the little provincial city. The Louds from whom the locality took its name
were never held in much repute, being considered of a stratum decidedly below the ordinary
social one of the city. When Andrew told his mother that he was to marry a Loud, she declared
that she would not go to his wedding, nor receive the girl at her house, and she kept her word.
When one day Andrew brought his sweetheart to his home to call, trusting to her pretty face
and graceful though rather sharp manner to win his mother's heart, he found her intrenched
in the kitchen, and absolutely indifferent to the charms of his Fanny in her stylish, albeit
somewhat tawdry, finery, though she had peeped to good purpose from her parlor window, which
commanded the road, before she fled kitchenward.

Mrs. Zelotes was beating eggs with as firm an impetus as if she were heaving up earth-works
to strengthen her own pride when her son thrust his timid face into the kitchen. "Mother, Fanny's
in the parlor," he said, beseechingly.

"Let her set there, then, if she wants to," said his mother, and that was all she would say.

Very soon Fanny went home on her lover's arm, freeing her mind with no uncertain voice on the
way, though she was on the public road, and within hearing of sharp ears in open windows. Fanny
had a pride as fierce as Mrs. Zelotes Brewster's, though it was not so well sustained, and
she would then and there have refused to marry Andrew had she not loved him with all her passionate
and ill-regulated heart. But she never forgave her mother-in-law for the slight she had put
upon her that day, and the slights which she put upon her later. She would have refused to
live next door to Mrs. Zelotes had not Andrew owned the land and been in a measure forced to
build there. Every time she had flaunted out of her new house-door in her wedding finery she
had an uncomfortable feeling of defiance under a fire of hostile eyes in the next house. She
kept her own windows upon that side as clear and bright as diamonds, and her curtains in the
stiffest, snowy slants, lest her terrible mother-in-law should have occasion to impeach her
housekeeping, she being a notable housewife. The habits of the Louds of Loudville were considered
shiftless in the extreme, and poor Fanny had heard an insinuation of Mrs. Zelotes to that effect.

The elder Mrs. Brewster's knowledge of her son's house and his wife was limited to the view
from her west windows, but there was half-truce when little Ellen was born. Mrs. Brewster,
who considered that no woman could be obtained with such a fine knowledge of nursing as she
possessed, and who had, moreover, a regard for her poor boy's pocket-book, appeared for the
first time in his doorway, and opened her heart to her son's child, if not to his wife, whom
she began to tolerate.

However, the two women had almost a hand-to-hand encounter over little Ellen's cradle, the
elder Mrs. Brewster judging that it was for her good to be rocked to sleep, the younger not.
Little Ellen herself, however, turned the balance that time in favor of her grandmother, since
she cried every time the gentle, swaying motion was hushed, and absolutely refused to go to
sleep, and her mother from the first held every course which seemed to contribute to her pleasure
and comfort as a sacred duty. At last it came to pass that the two women met only upon that
small neutral ground of love, and upon all other territory were sworn foes. Especially was
Mrs. Zelotes wroth when Eva Loud, after the death of her father, one of the most worthless
and shiftless of the Louds of Loudville, came to live with her married sister. She spoke openly
to Fanny concerning her opinion of another woman's coming to live on poor Andrew, and paid
no heed to the assertions that Eva would work and pay her way.

Mrs. Zelotes, although she acknowledged it no social degradation for a man to work in a shoe-factory,
regarded a woman who worked therein as having hopelessly forfeited her caste. Eva Loud had
worked in a shop ever since she was fourteen, and had tagged the grimy and leathery procession
of Louds, who worked in shoe-factories when they worked at all, in a short skirt with her hair
in a strong black pigtail. There was a kind of bold grace and showy beauty about this Eva Loud
which added to Mrs. Zelotes's scorn and dislike.

"She walks off to work in the shop as proud as if she was going to a party," she said, and
she fairly trembled with anger when she saw the girl set out with her son in the morning. She
would have considered it much more according to the eternal fitness of things had her son Andrew
been attending a queen whom he would have dropped at her palace on the way. She writhed inwardly
whenever little Ellen spoke of her aunt Eva, and would have forbidden her to do so had she dared.

"To think of that child associating with a shop-girl!" she said to Mrs. Pointdexter. Mrs. Pointdexter
was her particular friend, whom she regarded with loving tolerance of superiority, though she
had been the daughter of a former clergyman of the town, and had wedded another, and might
presumably have been accounted herself of a somewhat higher estate. The gentle and dependent
clergyman's widow, when she came back to her native city after the death of her husband, found
herself all at once in a pleasant little valley of humiliation at the feet of her old friend,
and was contented to abide there. "Perhaps your son's sister-in-law will marry and go away,"
she said, consolingly, to Mrs. Zelotes, who indeed lived in that hope. But Eva remained at
her sister's, and, though she had admirers in plenty, did not marry, and the dissension grew.

It was an odd thing that, however the sisters quarrelled, the minute Andrew tried to take sides
with his wife and assail Eva in his turn, Fanny turned and defended her. "I am not going to
desert all the sister I have got in the world," she said. "If you want me to leave, say so,
and I will go, but I shall never turn Eva out of doors. I would rather go with her and work
in the shop."  Then the next moment the wrangle would recommence, and the harsh trebles of
wrath would swell high. Andrew could not appreciate this savageness of race loyalty in the
face of anger and dissension, and his brain reeled with the apparent inconsistency of the thing.

"Sometimes I think they are both crazy," he used to tell his mother, who sympathized with him
after a covertly triumphant fashion. She never said, "I told you so," but the thought was evident
on her face, and her son saw it there.

However, he said not a word against his wife, except by implication. Though she and her sister
were making his home unbearable, he still loved her, and, even if he did not, he had something
of his mother's pride.

However, at last, when Ellen was almost eight years old, matters came suddenly to a climax
one evening in November. The two sisters were having a fiercer dispute than usual. Eva was
taking her sister to task for cutting over a dress of hers for Ellen, Fanny claiming that she
had given her permission to do so, and Eva denying it. The child sat listening in her little
chair with a look of dawning intelligence of wrath and wicked temper in her face, because she
was herself in a manner the cause of the dissension. Suddenly Andrew Brewster, with a fiery
outburst of inconsequent masculine wrath with the whole situation, essayed to cut the Gordian
knot. He grabbed the little dress of bright woollen stuff, which lay partly made upon the table,
and crammed it into the stove, and a reek of burning wool filled the room. Then both women
turned upon him with a combination of anger to which his wrath was wildfire.

Andrew caught up little Ellen, who was beginning to look scared, wrapped the first thing he
could seize around her, and fairly fled across the yard to his mother's. Then he sat down and
wept like a boy, and his pride left him at last. "Oh, mother," he sobbed, "if it were not for
the child, I would go away, for my home is a hell!"

Mrs. Zelotes stood clasping little Ellen, who clung to her, trembling. "Well, come over here
with me," she said, "you and Ellen."

"Live here in the next house!" said Andrew. "Do you suppose Fanny would have the child living
under her very eyes in the next house? No, there is no way out of the misery--no way; but if
it was not for the child, I would go!"

Andrew burst out in such wild sobs that his mother released Ellen and ran to him; and the child,
trembling and crying with a curious softness, as of fear at being heard, ran out of the house
and back to her home. "Oh, mother," she cried, breaking in upon the dialogue of anger which
was still going on there with her little tremulous flute--"oh, mother, father is crying!"

"I don't care," answered her mother, fiercely, her temper causing her to lose sight of the
child's agitation. "I don't care. If it wasn't for you, I would leave him. I wouldn't live
as I am doing. I would leave everybody. I am tired of this awful life. Oh, if it wasn't for
you, Ellen, I would leave everybody and start fresh!"

"You can leave me whenever you want to," said Eva, her handsome face burning red with wrath,
and she went out of the room, which was suffocating with the fumes of the burning wool, tossing
her black head, all banged and coiled in the latest fashion.

Of late years Fanny had sunk her personal vanity further and further in that for her child.
She brushed her own hair back hard from her temples, and candidly revealed all her unyouthful
lines, and dwelt fondly upon the arrangement of little Ellen's locks, which were of a fine,
pale yellow, as clear as the color of amber.

She never recut her skirts or her sleeves, but she studied anxiously all the slightest changes
in children's fashions. After her sister had left the room with a loud bang of the door, she
sat for a moment gazing straight ahead, her face working, then she burst into such a passion
of hysterical wailing as the child had never heard. Ellen, watching her mother with eyes so
frightened and full of horror that there was no room for childish love and pity in them, grew
very pale. She had left the door by which she had entered open; she gazed one moment at her
mother, then she turned and slipped out of the room, and, opening the outer door softly, though
her mother would not have heard nor noticed, went out of the house.

Then she ran as fast as she could down the frozen road, a little, dark figure, passing as rapidly
as the shadow of a cloud between the earth and the full moon.

Chapter II

The greatest complexity in the world attends the motive-power of any action. Infinite perspectives
of mental mirrors reflect the whys of all doing. An adult with long practice in analytic introspection
soon becomes bewildered when he strives to evolve the primary and fundamental reasons for his
deeds; a child so striving would be lost in unexpected depths; but a child never strives. A
child obeys unquestioningly and absolutely its own spiritual impellings without a backward
glance at them.

Little Ellen Brewster ran down the road that November night, and did not know then, and never
knew afterwards, why she ran. Loving renunciation was surging high in her childish heart, giving
an indication of tidal possibilities for the future, and there was also a bitter, angry hurt
of slighted dependency and affection. Had she not heard them say, her own mother and father
say, that they would be better off and happier with her out of the way, and she their dearest
loved and most carefully cherished possession in the whole world? It is a cruel fall for an
apple of the eye to the ground, for its law of gravitation is of the soul, and its fall shocks
the infinite. Little Ellen felt herself sorely hurt by her fall from such fair heights; she
was pierced by the sharp thorns of selfish interests which flourish below all the heavenward
windows of life.

Afterwards, when her mother and father tried to make her tell them why she ran away, she could
not say; the answer was beyond her own power.

There was no snow on the ground, but the earth was frozen in great ribs after a late thaw.
Ellen ran painfully between the ridges which a long line of ice-wagons had made with their
heavy wheels earlier in the day. When the spaces between the ridges were too narrow for her
little feet, she ran along the crests, and that was precarious. She fell once and bruised one
of her delicate knees, then she fell again, and struck the knee on the same place. It hurt
her, and she caught her breath with a gasp of pain. She pulled up her little frock and touched
her hand to her knee, and felt it wet, then she whimpered on the lonely road, and, curiously
enough, there was pity for her mother as well as for herself in her solitary grieving. "Mother
would feel pretty bad if she knew how I was hurt, enough to make it bleed," she murmured, between
her soft sobs. Ellen did not dare cry loudly, from a certain unvoiced fear which she had of
shocking the stillness of the night, and also from a delicate sense of personal dignity, and
a dislike of violent manifestations of feeling which had strengthened with her growth in the
midst of the turbulent atmosphere of her home. Ellen had the softest childish voice, and she
never screamed or shouted when excited. Instead of catching the motion of the wind, she still
lay before it, like some slender-stemmed flower. If Ellen had made much outcry with the hurt
in her heart and the smart of her knee, she might have been heard, for the locality was thickly
settled, though not in the business portion of the little city. The houses, set prosperously
in the midst of shaven lawns--for this was a thrifty and emulative place, and democracy held
up its head confidently--were built closely along the road, though that was lonely and deserted
at that hour. It was the hour between half-past six and half-past seven, when people were lingering
at their supper-tables, and had not yet started upon their evening pursuits. The lights shone
for the most part from the rear windows of the houses, and there was a vague compound odor
of tea and bread and beefsteak in the air. Poor Ellen had not had her supper; the wrangle at
home had dismissed it from everybody's mind. She felt more pitiful towards her mother and herself
when she smelt the food and reflected upon that. To think of her going away without any supper,
all alone in the dark night! There was no moon, and the solemn brilliancy of the stars made
her think with a shiver of awe of the Old Testament and the possibility of the Day of Judgment.
Suppose it should come, and she all alone out in the night, in the midst of all those worlds
and the great White Throne, without her mother? Ellen's grandmother, who was of a stanch orthodox
breed, and was, moreover, anxious to counteract any possible detriment as to religious training
from contact with the degenerate Louds of Loudville, had established a strict course of Bible
study for her granddaughter at a very early age. All celestial phenomena were in consequence
transposed into a Biblical key for the child, and she regarded the heavens swarming with golden
stars as a Hebrew child of a thousand years ago might have done.

She was glad when she came within the radius of a street light from time to time; they were
stationed at wide intervals in that neighborhood. Soon, however, she reached the factories,
when all mystery and awe, and vague terrors of what beside herself might be near unrevealed
beneath the mighty brooding of the night, were over. She was, as it were, in the mid-current
of the conditions of her own life and times, and the material force of it swept away all symbolisms
and unstable drift, and left only the bare rocks and shores of existence. Always when the child
had been taken by one of her elders past the factories, humming like gigantic hives, with their
windows alert with eager eyes of toil, glancing out at her over bench and machine, Ellen had
seen her secretly cherished imaginings recede into a night of distance like stars, and she
had felt her little footing upon the earth with a shock, and had clung more closely to the
leading hand of love. "That's where your poor father works," her grandmother would say. "Maybe
you'll have to work there some day," her aunt Eva had said once; and her mother, who had been
with her also, had cried out sharply as if she had been stung, "I guess that little delicate
thing ain't never goin' to work in a shoe-shop, Eva Loud."  And her aunt Eva had laughed, and
declared with emphasis that she guessed there was no need to worry yet awhile.

"She never shall, while I live," her mother had cried; and then Eva, coming to her sister's
aid against her own suggestion, had declared, with a vehemence which frightened Ellen, that
she would burn the shop down herself first.

As for Ellen's father, he never at that time dwelt upon the child's future as much as his wife
did, having a masculine sense of the instability of houses of air which prevented him from
entering them without a shivering of walls and roof into naught but star-mediums by his downrightness
of vision. "Oh, let the child be, can't you, Fanny?" he said, when his wife speculated whether
Ellen would be or do this or that when she should be a woman. He resented the conception of
the woman which would swallow up, like some metaphysical sorceress, his fair little child.
So when he now and then led Ellen past the factories it was never with the slightest surmise
as to any connection which she might have with them beyond the present one. "There's the shop
where father works," he would tell Ellen, with a tender sense of his own importance in his
child's eyes, and he was as proud as Punch when Ellen was able to point with her tiny pink
finger at the window where father worked. "That's where father works and earns money to buy
nice things for little Ellen," Andrew would repeat, beaming at her with divine foolishness,
and Ellen looked at the roaring, vibrating building as she might have looked at the wheels
of progress. She realized that her father was very great and smart to work in a place like
that, and earn money--so much of it. Ellen often heard her mother remark with pride how much
money Andrew earned.

To-night, when Ellen passed in her strange flight, the factories were still, though they were
yet blazing with light. The gigantic buildings, after a style of architecture as simple as
a child's block house, and adapted to as primitive an end, loomed up beside the road like windowed
shells enclosing massive concretenesses of golden light. They looked entirely vacant except
for light, for the workmen had all gone home, and there were only the keepers in the buildings.
There were three of them, representing three different firms, rival firms, grouped curiously
close together, but Lloyd's was much the largest. Andrew and Eva worked in Lloyd's.

She was near the last factory when she met a man hastening along with bent shoulders, of intent,
middle-aged progress. After he had passed her with a careless glance at the small, swift figure,
she smelt coffee. He was carrying home a pound for his breakfast supply. That suddenly made
her cry, though she did not know why. That familiar odor of home and the wontedness of life
made her isolation on her little atom of the unusual more pitiful. The man turned round sharply
when she sobbed. "Hullo! what's the matter, sis?" he called back, in a pleasant, hoarse voice.
Ellen did not answer; she fled as if she had wings on her feet. The man had many children of
his own, and was accustomed to their turbulence over trifles. He kept on, thinking that there
was a sulky child who had been sent on an errand against her will, that it was not late, and
she was safe enough on that road. He resumed his calculation as to whether his income would
admit of a new coal-stove that winter. He was a workman in a factory, with one accumulative
interest in life--coal-stoves. He bought and traded and swapped coal-stoves every winter with
keenest enthusiasm. Now he had one in his mind which he had just viewed in a window with the
rapture of an artist. It had a little nickel statuette on the top, and that quite crowded Ellen
out of his mind, which had but narrow accommodations.

So Ellen kept on unmolested, though her heart was beating loud with fright. When she came into
the brilliantly lighted stretch of Main Street, which was the business centre of the city,
her childish mind was partly diverted from herself. Ellen had not been down town many times
of an evening, and always in hand of her hurrying father or mother. Now she had run away and
cut loose from all restrictions of time; there was an eternity for observation before her,
with no call in-doors in prospect. She stopped at the first bright shop window, and suddenly
the exultation of freedom was over the child. She tasted the sweets of rebellion and disobedience.
She had stood before that window once before of an evening, and her aunt Eva had been with
her, and one of her young men friends had come up behind, and they had gone on, the child dragging
backward at her aunt's hand. Now she could stand as long as she wished, and stare and stare,
and drink in everything which her childish imagination craved, and that was much. The imagination
of a child is often like a voracious maw, seizing upon all that comes within reach, and producing
spiritual indigestions and assimilations almost endless in their effects upon the growth. This
window before which Ellen stood was that of a market: a great expanse of plate-glass framing
a crude study in the clearest color tones. It takes a child or an artist to see a picture without
the intrusion of its second dimension of sordid use and the gross reflection of humanity.

Ellen looked at the great shelf laid upon with flesh and vegetables and fruits with the careless
precision of a kaleidoscope, and did not for one instant connect anything thereon with the
ends of physical appetite, though she had not had her supper. What had a meal of beefsteak
and potatoes and squash served on the little white-laid table at home to do with those great
golden globes which made one end of the window like the remove from a mine, those satin-smooth
spheres, those cuts as of red and white marble? She had eaten apples, but these were as the
apples of the gods, lying in a heap of opulence, with a precious light-spot like a ruby on
every outward side. The turnips affected her imagination like ivory carvings: she did not recognize
them for turnips at all. She never afterwards believed them to be turnips; and as for cabbages,
they were green inflorescences of majestic bloom. There is one position from which all common
things can be seen with reflections of preciousness, and Ellen had insensibly taken it. The
window and the shop behind were illuminated with the yellow glare of gas, but the glass was
filmed here and there with frost, which tempered it as with a veil. In the background rosy-faced
men in white frocks were moving to and fro, customers were passing in and out, but they were
all glorified to the child. She did not see them as butchers, and as men and women selling
and buying dinners.

However, all at once everything was spoiled, for her fairy castle of illusion or a higher reality
was demolished, and that not by any blow of practicality, but by pity and sentiment. Ellen
was a woman-child, and suddenly she struck the rock upon which women so often wreck or effect
harbor, whichever it may be. All at once she looked up from the dazzling mosaic of the window
and saw the dead partridges and grouse hanging in their rumpled brown mottle of plumage, and
the dead rabbits, long and stark, with their fur pointed with frost, hanging in a piteous headlong
company, and all her delight and wonder vanished, and she came down to the hard actualities
of things. "Oh, the poor birds!" she cried out in her heart. "Oh, the poor birds, and the poor
bunnies!"

Just at that moment, when the sudden rush of compassion and indignation had swollen her heart
to the size of a woman's, and given it the aches of one, when her eyes were so dilated with
the sight of helpless injury and death that they reflected the mystery of it and lost the outlook
of childhood, when her pretty baby mouth was curved like an inverted bow of love with the impulse
of tears, Cynthia Lennox came up the street and stopped short when she reached her.

Suddenly Ellen felt some one pressing close to her, and, looking up, saw a woman, only middle-aged,
but whom she thought very old, because her hair was white, standing looking at her very keenly
with clear, light-blue eyes under a high, pale forehead, from which the gray hair was combed
uncompromisingly back. The woman had been a beauty once, of a delicate, nervous type, and had
a certain beauty now, a something which had endured like the fineness of texture of a web when
its glow of color has faded. Her black garments draped her with sober richness, and there was
a gleam of dark fur when the wind caught her cloak. A small tuft of ostrich plumes nodded from
her bonnet. Ellen smelt flowers vaguely, and looked at the lady's hand, but she did not carry any.

"Whose little girl are you?" Cynthia Lennox asked, softly, and Ellen did not answer. "Can't
you tell me whose little girl you are?" Cynthia Lennox asked again. Ellen did not speak, but
there was the swift flicker of a thought over her face which told her name as plainly as language
if the woman had possessed the skill to interpret it.

"Ellen Brewster--Ellen Brewster is my name," Ellen said to herself very hard, and that was
how she endured the reproach of her own silence.

The woman looked at her with surprise and admiration that were fairly passionate. Ellen was
a beautiful child, with a face like a white flower. People had always turned to look after
her, she was so charming, and had caused her mothers heart to swell with pride. "The way everybody
we met has stared after that child to-day!" she would whisper her husband when she brought
Ellen home from some little expedition; then the two would look at the little one's face with
the one holy vanity of the world. Ellen wore to-night the little white shawl which her father
had caught up when he carried her over to her grandmother's. She held it tightly together under
her chin with one tiny hand, and her face looked out from between the soft folds with the absolute
purity of curve and color of a pearl.

"Oh, you darling!" said the woman, suddenly; "you darling!" and Ellen shrank away from her.
"Don't be afraid, dear," said Cynthia Lennox. "Don't be afraid, only tell me who you are. What
is your name, dear?"  But Ellen remained silent; only, as she shrank aloof, her eyes grew wild
and bright with startled tears, and her sweet baby mouth quivered piteously. She wanted to
run, but the habit of obedience was so strong upon her little mind that she feared to do so.
This strange woman seemed to have gotten her in some invisible leash.

"Tell me what your name is, darling," said the woman, but she might as well have importuned
a flower. Ellen was proof against all commands in that direction. She suddenly felt the furry
sweep of the lady's cloak against her cheek, and a nervous, tender arm drawing her close, though
she strove feebly to resist. "You are cold, you have nothing on but this little white shawl,
and perhaps you are hungry. What were you looking in this window for? Tell me, dear, where
is your mother? She did not send you on an errand, such a little girl as you are, so late on
such a cold night, with no more on than this?"

A tone of indignation crept into the lady's voice.

"No, mother didn't send me," Ellen said, speaking for the first time.

"Then did you run away, dear?"  Ellen was silent. "Oh, if you did, darling, you must tell me
where you live, what your father's name is, and I will take you home. Tell me, dear. If it
is far, I will get a carriage, and you shall ride home. Tell me, dear."

There was an utmost sweetness of maternal persuasion in Cynthia Lennox's voice; Ellen was swayed
by it as a child might have been swayed by the magic pipe of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. She
half yielded to her leading motion, then she remembered. "No," she cried out, with a sob of
utter desolation. "No, no."

"Why not, dear?"

"They don't want; they don't want. No, no!"

"They don't want you? Your own father and mother don't want you? Darling, what is the matter?"
But Ellen was dumb again. She stood sobbing, with a painful restraint, and pulling futilely
from the lady's persuasive hand. But it ended in the mastery of the child. Suddenly Cynthia
Lennox gathered her up in her arms under her great fur-lined cloak, and carried her a little
farther down the street, then across it to a dwelling-house, one of the very few which had
withstood the march of business blocks on this crowded main street of the provincial city.
A few people looked curiously at the lady carrying such a heavy, weeping child, but she met
no one whom she knew, and the others looked indifferently away after a second backward stare.
Cynthia Lennox was one to bear herself with such dignity over all jolts of circumstances that
she might almost convince others of her own exemption from them. Her mental bearing disproved
the evidence of the senses, and she could have committed a crime with such consummate self-poise
and grace as to have held a crowd in abeyance with utter distrust of their own eyes before
such unquestioning confidence in the sovereignty of the situation. Cynthia Lennox had always
had her own way except in one respect, and that experience had come to her lately.

Though she was such a slender woman, she seemed to have great strength in her arms, and she
bore Ellen easily and as if she had been used to such a burden. She wrapped her cloak closely
around the child.

"Don't be afraid, darling," she kept whispering. Ellen panted in bewilderment, and a terror
which was half assuaged by something like fascination.

She was conscious of a soft smother of camphor, in which the fur-lined cloak had lain through
the summer, and of that flower odor, which was violets, though she did not know it. Only the
wild American scentless ones had come in little Ellen's way so far.

She felt herself carried up steps, then a door was thrown open, and a warm breath of air came
in her face, and the cloak was tossed back, and she was set softly on the floor. The hall in
which she stood seemed very bright; she blinked and rubbed her eyes.

The lady stood over her, laughing gently, and when the child looked up at her, seemed much
younger than she had at first, very young in spite of her white hair. There was a soft red
on her cheek; her lips looked full and triumphant with smiles; her eyes were like stars. An
emotion of her youth which had never become dulled by satisfaction had suddenly blossomed out
on her face, and transformed it. An unassuaged longing may serve to preserve youth as well
as an undestroyed illusion; indeed, the two are one. Cynthia Lennox looked at the child as
if she had been a young mother, and she her first-born; triumph over the future, and daring
for all odds, and perfect faith in the kingdom of joy were in her look. Had she nursed one
child like Ellen to womanhood, and tasted the bitter in the cup, she would not have been capable
of that look, and would have been as old as her years. She threw off her cloak and took off
her bonnet, and the light struck her hair and made it look like silver. A brooch in the laces
at her throat shone with a thousand hues, and as Ellen gazed at it she felt curiously dull
and dizzy. She did not resist at all when the lady removed her little white shawl, but stared
at her with the look of some small and helpless thing in too large a grasp of destiny to admit
of a struggle. "Oh, you darling!" Cynthia Lennox said, and stooped and kissed her, and half
carried her into a great, warm, dazzling room, with light reflected in long lines of gold from
picture-frames on the wall, and now and then startling patches of lurid color blazing forth
unmeaningly from the dark incline of their canvases, with gleams of crystal and shadows of
bronze in settings of fretted ebony, with long swayings of rich draperies at doors and windows,
a red light of fire in a grate, and two white lights, one of piano keys, the other of a flying
marble figure in a corner, outlined clearly against dusky red. The light in this room was very
dim. It was all beyond Ellen's imagination. The White North where the Norway spruces lived
would not have seemed as strange to her as this. Neither would Bluebeard's Castle, nor the
House that Jack Built, nor the Palace of King Solomon, nor the tent in which lived little Joseph
in his coat of many colors, nor even the Garden of Eden, nor Noah's Ark. Her imagination had
not prepared her for a room like this. She had formed her ideas of rooms upon her grandmother's
and her mother's and the neighbors' best parlors, with their glories of crushed plush and gilt
and onyx and cheap lace and picture-throws and lambrequins. This room was such a heterodoxy
against her creed of civilization that it did not look beautiful to her as much as strange
and bewildering, and when she was bidden to sit down in a little inlaid precious chair she
put down her tiny hand and reflected, with a sense of strengthening of her household faith,
that her grandmother had beautiful, smooth, shiny hair-cloth.

Cynthia Lennox pulled the chair close to the fire, and bade her hold out her little feet to
the blaze to warm them well. "I am afraid you are chilled, darling," she said, and looked at
her sitting there in her dainty little red cashmere frock, with her spread of baby-yellow hair
over her shoulders. Then Ellen thought that the lady was younger than her mother; but her mother
had borne her and nursed her, and suffered and eaten of the tree of knowledge, and tasted the
bitter after the sweet; and this other woman was but as a child in the garden, though she was
fairly old. But along with Ellen's conviction of the lady's youth had come a conviction of
her power, and she yielded to her unquestioningly. Whenever she came near her she gazed with
dilating eyes upon the blazing circle of diamonds at her throat.

When she was bidden, she followed the lady into the dining-room, where the glitter of glass
and silver and the soft gleam of precious china made her think for a little while that she
must be in a store. She had never seen anything like this except in a store, when she had been
with her mother to buy a lamp-chimney. So she decided this to be a store, but she said nothing.
She did not speak at all, but she ate her biscuits, and slice of breast of chicken, and sponge-cake,
and drank her milk.

She had her milk in a little silver cup which seemed as if it might have belonged to another
child; she also sat in a small high-chair, which made it seem as if another child had lived
or visited in the house. Ellen became singularly possessed with this sense of the presence
of a child, and when the door opened she would look around for her to enter, but it was always
an old black woman with a face of imperturbable bronze, which caused her to huddle closer into
her chair when she drew near.

There were not many colored people in the city, and Ellen had never seen any except at Long
Beach, where she had sometimes gone to have a shore dinner with her mother and Aunt Eva. Then
she always used to shrink when the black waiter drew near, and her mother and aunt would be
convulsed with furtive mirth. "See the little gump," her mother would say in the tenderest
tone, and look about to see if others at the other tables saw how cunning she was--what a charming
little goose to be afraid of a colored waiter.

Ellen saw nobody except the lady and the black woman, but she was still sure that there was
a child in the house, and after supper, when she was taken up-stairs to bed, she peeped through
every open door with the expectation of seeing her.

But she was so weary and sleepy that her curiosity and capacity for any other emotion was blunted.
She had become simply a little, tired, sleepy animal. She let herself be undressed; she was
not even moved to much self-pity when the lady discovered the cruel bruise on her delicate
knee, and kissed it, and dressed it with a healing salve. She was put into a little night-gown
which she knew dreamily belonged to that other child, and was laid in a little bedstead which
she noted to be made of gold, with floating lace over the head.

She sleepily noted, too, that there were flowers on the walls, and more floating lace over
the bureau. This room did not look so strange to her as the others; she had somehow from the
treasures of her fancy provided the family of big bears and little bears with a similar one.
Then, too, one of the neighbors, Mrs. George Crocker, had read many articles in women's papers
relative to the beautifying of homes, and had furnished a wonderful chamber with old soap-boxes
and rolls of Japanese paper which was a sort of a cousin many times removed of this. When she
was in bed the lady kissed her, and called her darling, and bade her sleep well, and not be
afraid, she was in the next room, and could hear if she spoke. Then she stood looking at her,
and Ellen thought that she must be younger than Minnie Swensen, who lived on her street, and
wore a yellow pigtail, and went to the high-school. Then she closed her heavy eyes, and forgot
to cry about her poor father and mother; still, there was, after all, a hurt about them down
in her childish heart, though a great wave of new circumstances had rolled on her shore and
submerged for the time her memory and her love, even, she was so feeble and young.

She slept very soundly, and awoke only once, about two o'clock in the morning. Then a passing
lantern flashed into the chamber into her eyes, and woke her up, but she only sighed and stretched
drowsily, then turned her little body over with a luxurious roll and went to sleep again.

It was poor Andrew Brewster's lantern which flashed in her eyes, for he was out with a posse
of police and sympathizing neighbors and friends searching for his lost little girl. He was
frantic, and when he came under the gas-lights from time to time the men that saw him shuddered;
they would not have known him, for almost the farthest agony of which he was capable had changed
his face.

Chapter III

By the next morning all the city was in a commotion over little Ellen's disappearance. Woods
on the outskirts were being searched, ponds were being dragged, posters with a stare of dreadful
meaning in large characters of black and white were being pasted all over the fences and available
barns, and already three of the local editors had been to the Brewster house to obtain particulars
and photographs of the missing child for reproduction in the city papers.

The first train from Boston brought two reporters representing great dailies.

Fanny Brewster, white-cheeked, with the rasped redness of tears around her eyes and mouth,
clad in her blue calico wrapper, received them in her best parlor. Eva had made a fire in the
best parlor stove early that morning. "Folks will be comin' in all day, I expect," said she,
speaking with nervous catches of her breath. Ever since the child had been missed, Eva's anxiety
had driven her from point to point of unrest as with a stinging lash. She had pelted bareheaded
down the road and up the road; she had invaded all the neighbors' houses, insisting upon looking
through their farthest and most unlikely closets; she had even penetrated to the woods, and
joined wild-eyed the groups of peering workers on the shore of the nearest pond. That she could
not endure long, so she had rushed home to her sister, who was either pacing her sitting-room
with inarticulate murmurs and wails of distress in the sympathizing ears of several of the
neighboring women, or else was staring with haggard eyes of fearful hope from a window. When
she looked from the eastern window she could see her mother-in-law, Mrs. Zelotes Brewster,
at an opposite one, sitting immovable, with her Bible in her lap, prayer in her heart, and
an eye of grim holding to faith upon the road for the fulfilment of promise. She felt all her
muscles stiffen with anger when she saw the wild eyes of the child's mother at the other window.
"It is all her fault," she said to herself--"all her fault--hers and that bold trollop of a
sister of hers."  When she saw Eva run down the road, with her black hair rising like a mane
to the morning wind, she was an embodiment of an imprecatory psalm. When, later on, she saw
the three editors coming--Mr. Walsey, of The Spy, and Mr. Jones, of The Observer, and young
Joe Bemis, of The Star, on his bicycle--she watched jealously to see if they were admitted.
When Fanny's head disappeared from the eastern window she knew that Eva had let them in and
Fanny was receiving them in the parlor. "She will tell them all about the words they had last
night, that made the dear child run away," she thought. "All the town will know what doings
there are in our family."  Mrs. Zelotes made up her mind to a course of action. Each editor
was granted a long audience with Fanny and Eva, who entertained them with hysterical solemnity
and displayed Ellen's photographs in the red plush album, from the last, taken in her best
white frock, to one when she was three weeks old, and seeming weakly and not likely to live.
This had been taken by a photographer summoned to the house at great expense. "Her father has
never spared expense for Ellen," said Fanny, with an outburst of grief. "That's so," said Eva.
"I'll testify to that. Andrew Brewster never thought anything was too good for that young one."
Then she burst out with a sob louder than her sister's. Eva had usually a coarsely well-kempt
appearance, her heavy black hair being securely twisted, and her neck ribbons tied with smart
jerks of neatness; but to-day her hair was still in the fringy braids of yesterday, and her
cotton blouse humped untidily in the back. Her face was red and her lips swollen; she looked
like a very bacchante of sorrow, and as if she had been on some mad orgy of grief.

Mr. Walsey, of The Spy, who had formerly conducted a paper in a college town and was not accustomed
to the feminine possibilities of manufacturing localities, felt almost afraid of her. He had
never seen a woman of that sort, and thought vaguely of the French Revolution and fish-wives
when she gave vent to her distress over the loss of the child. He fairly jumped when she cut
short a question of his with a volley of self-recriminatory truths, accompanied with fierce
gesturing. He stood back involuntarily out of reach of those powerful, waving arms. "Do I know
of any reason for the child to run away?" shrieked Eva, in a voice shrilly hideous with emotion,
now and then breaking into hoarseness with the strain of tears. "I guess I know why, I guess
I do, and I wish I had been six foot under ground before I did what I did. It was all my fault,
every bit of it. When I got home, and found that Fan had been making that precious young one
a dress out of my old blue one, I pitched into her for it, and she gave it back to me, and
then we jawed, and kept it up, till Andrew, he grabbed the dress and flung it into the fire,
and did just right, too, and took Ellen and run over to old lady Brewster's with her; then
Ellen, she see him cryin', and it scared her 'most to death, poor little thing, and she heard
him say that if it wasn't for her he'd quit, and then she come runnin' home to her mother and
me, and her mother said the same thing, and then that poor young one, she thought she wa'n't
wanted nowheres, and she run. She always was as easy to hurt as a baby robin; it didn't take
nothing to set her all of a flutter and a twitter; and now she's just flown out of the nest.
Oh my God, I wish my tongue had been torn out by the roots before I'd said a word about her
blessed little dress; I wish Fan had cut up every old rag I've got; I'd go dressed in fig-leaves
before I'd had it happen. Oh! oh! oh!"

Young Joe Bemis, of The Star, was the first to leave, whirling madly and precariously down
the street on his wheel, which was dizzily tall in those days. Mrs. Zelotes, hailing him from
her open window, might as well have hailed the wind. Her family dissensions were well aired
in The Star next morning, and she always kept the cutting at the bottom of a little rosewood
work-box where she stored away divers small treasures, and never looked at the box without
a swift dart of pain as from a hidden sting and the consciousness as of the presence of some
noxious insect caged therein.

Mrs. Zelotes was more successful in arresting the progress of the other editors, and (standing
at the window, her Bible on the little table at her side) flatly contradicted all that had
been told them by her daughter-in-law and her sister. "The Louds always give way, no matter
what comes up. You can always tell what kind of a family anybody comes from by the way they
take things when anything comes across them. You can't depend on anything she says this morning.
My son did not marry just as I wished; everybody knows that; the Louds weren't equal to our
family, and everybody knows it, and I have never made any secret as to how I felt, but we have
always got along well enough. The Brewsters are not quarrelsome; they never have been. There
were no words whatever last night to make my granddaughter run away. Eva and Fanny are all
wrong about it. Ellen has been stolen; I know it as well as if I had seen it. A strange-looking
woman came to the door yesterday afternoon; she was the tallest woman I ever saw, and she took
the widest steps; she measured her dress skirt every step she took, and she spoke gruff. I
said then I knew she was a man dressed up. Ellen was playing out in the yard, and she saw the
child as she went out, and I see her stoop and look at her real sharp, and my blood run kind
of cold then, and I called Ellen away as quick as I could; and the woman, she turned round
and gave me a look that I won't ever forget as long as I live. My belief is that that woman
was laying in wait when Ellen was going across the yard home from here last night, and she
has got her safe somewhere till a reward is offered. Or maybe she wants to keep her, Ellen
is such a beautiful child. You needn't put in your papers that my grandchild run away because
of quarrelling in our family, because she didn't. Eva and Fanny don't know what they are talking
about, they are so wrought up; and, coming from the family they do, they don't know how to
control themselves and show any sense. I feel it as much as they do, but I have been sitting
here all the morning; I know I can't do anything to help, and I am working a good deal harder,
waiting, than they are, rushing from pillar to post and taking on, and I'm doing more good.
I shall be the only one fit to do anything when they find the poor child. I've got blankets
warming by the fire, and my tea-kettle on, and I'm going to be the one to depend on when she's
brought home."  Mrs. Zelotes gave a glance of defiant faith from the window down the road as
she spoke. Then she settled back in her chair and resumed her Bible, and dismissed the tall
and forbidding woman whom she had summoned to save the honor of her family resolutely from
her conscience. The editors of The Spy and The Observer had a row of ingratiating photographs
of little Ellen from three weeks to seven years of age; and their opinions as to the cause
of her disappearance, while fully agreeing in all points of sensationalism with those of young
Bemis, of The Star, differed in detail.

Young Bemis read about the mysterious kidnapper, and wondered, and the demand for The Star
was chiefly among the immediate neighbors of the Brewsters. Both The Observer and The Spy doubled
their circulation in one day, and every face on the night cars was hidden behind poor little
Ellen's baby countenances and the fairy-story of the witch-woman who had lured her away. Mothers
kept their children carefully in-doors that evening, and pulled down curtains, fearful lest
She look in the windows and be tempted. Mrs. Zelotes also waylaid both of the Boston reporters,
but with results upon which she had not counted. One presented her story and Fanny's and Eva's
with impartial justice; the other kept wholly to the latter version, with the addition of a
shrewd theory of his own, deduced from the circumstances which had a parallel in actual history,
and boldly stated that the child had probably committed suicide on account of family troubles.
Poor Fanny and Eva both saw that, when night was falling and Ellen had not been found. Eva
rushed out and secured the paper from the newsboy, and the two sisters gasped over the startling
column together.

"It's a lie! oh, Fanny, it's a lie!" cried Eva. "She never would; oh, she never would! That
little thing, just because she heard you and me scoldin', and you said that to her, that if
it wasn't for her you'd go away. She never would."

"Go away?" sobbed Fanny--"go away? I wouldn't go away from hell if she was there. I would burn;
I would hear the clankin' of chains, and groans, and screeches, and devils whisperin' in my
ears what I had done wrong, for all eternity, before I'd go where they were playin' harps in
heaven, if she was there. I'd like it better, I would. And I'd stay here if I had twenty sisters
I didn't get along with, and be happier than I would be anywhere else on earth, if she was
here. But she couldn't have done it. She didn't know how. It's awful to put such things into
papers."

Eva jumped up with a fierce gesture, ran to the stove, and crammed the paper in. "There!" said
she; "I wish I could serve all the papers in the country the same way. I do, and I'd like to
put all the editors in after 'em. I'd like to put 'em in the stove with their own papers for
kindlin's."  Suddenly Eva turned with a swish of skirts, and was out of the room and pounding
up-stairs, shaking the little house with every step. When she returned she bore over her arm
her best dress--a cherished blue silk, ornate with ribbons and cheap lace. "Where's that pattern?"
she asked her sister.

"She wouldn't ever do such a thing," moaned Fanny.

"Where's that pattern?"

"What pattern?" Fanny said, faintly.

"That little dress pattern. Her little dress pattern, the one you cut over my dress for her by."

"In the bureau drawer in my room. Oh, she wouldn't."

Eva went into the bedroom, returned with the pattern, got the scissors from Fanny's work-basket,
and threw her best silk dress in a rustling heap upon the table.

Fanny stopped moaning and looked at her with wretched wonder. "What be you goin' to do?"

"Do?" cried Eva, fiercely--"do? I'm goin' to cut this dress over for her."

"You ain't."

"Yes, I be. If I drove her away from home, scoldin' because you cut over that other old thing
of mine for her, I'm goin' to make up for it now. I'm goin' to give her my best blue silk,
that I paid a dollar and a half a yard for, and 'ain't worn three times. Yes, I be. She's goin'
to have a dress cut out of it, an' she's comin' back to wear it, too. You'll see she is comin'
home to wear it."

Eva cut wildly into the silk with mad slashes of her gleaming shears, while two neighboring
women, who had just come into the room, stared aghast, and even Fanny was partly diverted from
her sorrow.

"She's crazy," whispered one of the women, backing away as she spoke.

"Oh, Eva, don't; don't do so," pleaded Fanny, tremulously.

"I be," said Eva, and she cut recklessly up the front breadth.

"You ain't cutting it right," said the other neighbor, who was skilful in such matters, and
never fully moved from her own household grooves by any excitement. "If you are a-goin' to
cut it at all, you had better cut it right."

"I don't care how I cut it," returned Eva, thrusting the woman away. "Oh, I don't care how
I cut it; I want to waste it. I will waste it."

The other neighbor backed entirely out of the room, then turned and fled across the yard, her
calico wrapper blowing wildly and lashing about her slender legs, to her own house, the doors
of which she locked. It is too gross for Comedy.

Incidents of a kind casting ridicule on our unfortunate nature instead of our conventional
life, provoke derisive laughter, which thwarts the Comic idea. But derision is foiled by the
play of the intellect. Most of doubtful causes in contest are open to Comic interpretation, and
any intellectual pleading of a doubtful cause contains germs of an
Idea of Comedy.

The laughter of satire is a blow in the back or the face. The laughter of Comedy is impersonal
and of unrivalled politeness, nearer a smile; often no more than a smile. It laughs through the
mind, for the mind directs it; and it might be called the humour of the mind.

One excellent test of the civilization of a country, as I have said,
I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy; and the
test of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter.

If you believe that our civilization is founded in common-sense (and
it is the first condition of sanity to believe it), you will, when
contemplating men, discern a Spirit overhead; not more heavenly than
the light flashed upward from glassy surfaces, but luminous and watchful;
never shooting beyond them, nor lagging in the rear; so closely attached
to them that it may be taken for a slavish reflex, until its features
are studied.

It has the sage's brows, and the sunny malice of a faun lurks at the corners of the half-closed
lips drawn in an idle wariness of half tension.

Not to distinguish it is to be bull-blind to the spiritual, and to deny the existence of a mind
of man where minds of men are in working conjunction.

You must, as I have said, believe that our state of society is founded in common-sense, otherwise
you will not be struck by the contrasts the Comic Spirit perceives,
or have it to look to for your consolation.

You will, in fact, be standing in that peculiar oblique beam of light,
yourself illuminated to the general eye as the very object of chase
and doomed quarry of the thing obscure to you.

But to feel its presence and to see it is your assurance that many
sane and solid minds are with you in what you are experiencing: and
this of itself spares you the pain of satirical heat, and the bitter
craving to strike heavy blows.

You share the sublime of wrath, that would not have hurt the foolish, but merely demonstrate their
foolishness. Moliere was contented to revenge himself on the critics of the Ecole des Femmes,
by writing the Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes, one of the wisest
as well as the playfullest of studies in criticism.

A perception of the comic spirit gives high fellowship. You become a citizen of the selecter
world, the highest we know of in connection with our old world, which
is not supermundane.

Look there for your unchallengeable upper class! You feel that you are one of this our civilized
community, that you cannot escape from it, and would not if you could. Good hope sustains you;
weariness does not overwhelm you; in isolation you see no charms for vanity; personal pride is
greatly moderated.

Nor shall your title of citizenship exclude you from worlds of imagination
or of devotion.

The Comic spirit is not hostile to the sweetest songfully poetic.

Chaucer bubbles with it: Shakespeare overflows: there is a mild moon's
ray of it (pale with super-refinement through distance from our flesh
and blood planet) in Comus.

Pope has it, and it is the daylight side of the night half obscuring Cowper. It is only hostile
to the priestly element, when that, by baleful swelling, transcends and overlaps the bounds of its
office: and then, in extreme cases, it is too true to itself to speak, and veils the lamp:
as, for example, the spectacle of Bossuet over the dead body of Moliere: at which the dark angels
may, but men do not laugh.

We have had comic pulpits, for a sign that the laughter-moving and the worshipful may be in alliance:
I know not how far comic, or how much assisted in seeming so by the
unexpectedness and the relief of its appearance: at least they are
popular, they are said to win the ear.

Laughter is open to perversion, like other good things; the scornful and the brutal sorts are
not unknown to us; but the laughter directed by the Comic spirit is a harmless wine, conducing
to sobriety in the degree that it enlivens. It enters you like fresh air into a study; as
when one of the sudden contrasts of the comic idea floods the brain like reassuring daylight. You
are cognizant of the true kind by feeling that you take it in, savour
it, and have what flowers live on, natural air for food.

That which you give out--the joyful roar--is not the better part; let that go to good fellowship
and the benefit of the lungs. Aristophanes promises his auditors that if they will retain the
ideas of the comic poet carefully, as they keep dried fruits in boxes,
their garments shall smell odoriferous of wisdom throughout the year.

The boast will not be thought an empty one by those who have choice
friends that have stocked themselves according to his directions.

Such treasuries of sparkling laughter are wells in our desert. Sensitiveness to the comic laugh
is a step in civilization. To shrink from being an object of it is a step in cultivation. We
know the degree of refinement in men by the matter they will laugh at, and the ring of the laugh;
but we know likewise that the larger natures are distinguished by
the great breadth of their power of laughter, and no one really loving
Moliere is refined by that love to despise or be dense to Aristophanes,
though it may be that the lover of Aristophanes will not have risen
to the height of Moliere.

Embrace them both, and you have the whole scale of laughter in your breast. Nothing in the
world surpasses in stormy fun the scene in The Frogs, when Bacchus and Xanthias receive their
thrashings from the hands of businesslike OEacus, to discover which is the divinity of the two,
by his imperviousness to the mortal condition of pain, and each, under the obligation of not
crying out, makes believe that his horrible bellow--the god's iou iou being the lustier--means
only the stopping of a sneeze, or horseman sighted, or the prelude to an invocation to some
deity: and the slave contrives that the god shall get the bigger lot of blows. Passages of
Rabelais, one or two in Don Quixote, and the Supper in the Manner of the Ancients, in Peregrine
Pickle, are of a similar cataract of laughter. But it is not illuminating; it is not the laughter
of the mind. Moliere's laughter, in his purest comedies, is ethereal, as light to our nature,
as colour to our thoughts.

The Misanthrope and the Tartuffe have no audible laughter; but the characters are steeped in
the comic spirit. They quicken the mind through laughter, from coming out of the mind; and
the mind accepts them because they are clear interpretations of certain
chapters of the Book lying open before us all.

Between these two stand Shakespeare and Cervantes, with the richer
laugh of heart and mind in one; with much of the Aristophanic robustness,
something of Moliere's delicacy.

* * * * *

The laughter heard in circles not pervaded by the Comic idea, will sound harsh and soulless, like
versified prose, if you step into them with a sense of the distinction.

You will fancy you have changed your habitation to a planet remoter
from the sun.

You may be among powerful brains too.

You will not find poets--or but a stray one, over-worshipped.

You will find learned men undoubtedly, professors, reputed philosophers, and illustrious dilettanti.
They have in them, perhaps, every element composing light, except the Comic. They read verse, they
discourse of art; but their eminent faculties are not under that vigilant sense of a collective
supervision, spiritual and present, which we have taken note of. They build a temple of arrogance;
they speak much in the voice of oracles; their hilarity, if it does not dip in grossness, is
usually a form of pugnacity.

Insufficiency of sight in the eye looking outward has deprived them of the eye that should
look inward. They have never weighed themselves in the delicate balance of the Comic idea so
as to obtain a suspicion of the rights and dues of the world; and they have, in consequence,
an irritable personality. A very learned English professor crushed an argument in a political
discussion, by asking his adversary angrily: 'Are you aware, sir, that I am a philologer?'

The practice of polite society will help in training them, and the professor on a sofa with beautiful
ladies on each side of him, may become their pupil and a scholar in manners without knowing it:
he is at least a fair and pleasing spectacle to the Comic Muse. But the society named polite
is volatile in its adorations, and to-morrow will be petting a bronzed soldier, or a black African,
or a prince, or a spiritualist: ideas cannot take root in its ever-shifting soil. It is besides addicted
in self-defence to gabble exclusively of the affairs of its rapidly
revolving world, as children on a whirligoround bestow their attention
on the wooden horse or cradle ahead of them, to escape from giddiness
and preserve a notion of identity.

The professor is better out of a circle that often confounds by lionizing, sometimes annoys
by abandoning, and always confuses. The school that teaches gently what peril there is lest
a cultivated head should still be coxcomb's, and the collisions which may befall high-soaring
minds, empty or full, is more to be recommended than the sphere of incessant motion supplying
it with material.

Lands where the Comic spirit is obscure overhead are rank with raw crops of matter. The traveller
accustomed to smooth highways and people not covered with burrs and prickles is amazed, amid
so much that is fair and cherishable, to come upon such curious barbarism. An Englishman paid
a visit of admiration to a professor in the Land of Culture, and was introduced by him to another
distinguished professor, to whom he took so cordially as to walk out with him alone one afternoon.
The first professor, an erudite entirely worthy of the sentiment of scholarly esteem prompting
the visit, behaved (if we exclude the dagger) with the vindictive jealousy of an injured Spanish
beauty. After a short prelude of gloom and obscure explosions, he discharged upon his faithless
admirer the bolts of passionate logic familiar to the ears of flighty caballeros:--'Either I am
a fit object of your admiration, or I am not. Of these things one--either you are competent
to judge, in which case I stand condemned by you; or you are incompetent, and therefore impertinent,
and you may betake yourself to your country again, hypocrite!' The
admirer was for persuading the wounded scholar that it is given to
us to be able to admire two professors at a time.

He was driven forth.

Perhaps this might have occurred in any country, and a comedy of The Pedant, discovering the
greedy humanity within the dusty scholar, would not bring it home to one in particular. I am
mindful that it was in Germany, when I observe that the Germans have
gone through no comic training to warn them of the sly, wise emanation
eyeing them from aloft, nor much of satirical.

Heinrich Heine has not been enough to cause them to smart and meditate. Nationally, as well
as individually, when they are excited they are in danger of the
grotesque, as when, for instance, they decline to listen to evidence,
and raise a national outcry because one of German blood has been convicted
of crime in a foreign country.

They are acute critics, yet they still wield clubs in controversy. Compare them in this respect with
the people schooled in La Bruyere, La Fontaine, Moliere; with the people who have the figures
of a Trissotin and a Vadius before them for a comic warning of the
personal vanities of the caressed professor.

It is more than difference of race. It is the difference of traditions, temper, and style, which comes
of schooling.

The French controversialist is a polished swordsman, to be dreaded
in his graces and courtesies.

The German is Orson, or the mob, or a marching army, in defence of a good case or a bad--a big
or a little. His irony is a missile of terrific tonnage: sarcasm he emits like a blast from a
dragon's mouth. He must and will be Titan. He stamps his foe underfoot, and is astonished that
the creature is not dead, but stinging; for, in truth, the Titan
is contending, by comparison, with a god.

When the Germans lie on their arms, looking across the Alsatian frontier at the crowds of Frenchmen
rushing to applaud L'ami Fritz at the Theatre Francais, looking and
considering the meaning of that applause, which is grimly comic in
its political response to the domestic moral of the play--when the
Germans watch and are silent, their force of character tells.

They are kings in music, we may say princes in poetry, good speculators in philosophy, and
our leaders in scholarship. That so gifted a race, possessed moreover of the stern good sense which
collects the waters of laughter to make the wells, should show at a disadvantage, I hold for
a proof, instructive to us, that the discipline of the comic spirit is needful to their growth.
We see what they can reach to in that great figure of modern manhood, Goethe. They are a growing
people; they are conversable as well; and when their men, as in France, and at intervals at
Berlin tea-tables, consent to talk on equal terms with their women, and to listen to them, their
growth will be accelerated and be shapelier. Comedy, or in any form the Comic spirit, will
then come to them to cut some figures out of the block, show them the mirror, enliven and irradiate
the social intelligence.

Modern French comedy is commendable for the directness of the study of actual life, as far as that,
which is but the early step in such a scholarship, can be of service in composing and colouring the
picture. A consequence of this crude, though well-meant, realism is the collision of the writers
in their scenes and incidents, and in their characters. The Muse of most of them is an Aventuriere.
She is clever, and a certain diversion exists in the united scheme for confounding her. The
object of this person is to reinstate herself in the decorous world; and either, having accomplished
this purpose through deceit, she has a nostalgie de la boue, that eventually casts her back into it,
or she is exposed in her course of deception when she is about to gain her end. A very good,
innocent young man is her victim, or a very astute, goodish young man obstructs her path. This
latter is enabled to be the champion of the decorous world by knowing the indecorous well.
He has assisted in the progress of Aventurieres downward; he will not help them to ascend.
The world is with him; and certainly it is not much of an ascension they aspire to; but what
sort of a figure is he? The triumph of a candid realism is to show him no hero.
 Ellen repeated in her gentle wail as plaintively inconsequent as the note of a
bird, and would say no more.

Then Cynthia displayed the parrot, but a parrot was too fine and fierce a bird for Ellen. She
would have preferred him as a subject for her imagination, which could not be harmed by his
beak and claws, and she liked Cynthia's story about him better than the gorgeous actuality
of the bird himself. She shrank back from that shrieking splendor, clinging with strong talons
to his cage wires, against which he pressed cruelly his red breast and beat his gold-green
wings, and through which he thrust his hooked beak, and glared with his yellow eyes.

Ellen fairly sobbed at last when the parrot thrust out a wicked and deceiving claw towards
her, and said something in his unearthly shriek which seemed to have a distinct reference to
her, and fired at her a volley of harsh "How do's" and "Good-mornings," and "Good-nights,"
and "Polly want a cracker's," then finished with a wild shriek of laughter, her note of human
grief making a curious chord with the bird's of inhuman mirth. "I want my mother!" she panted
out, and wept, and would not be comforted. Then Cynthia took her away from the parrot and produced
the doll. Then truly did the sentiment of emulative motherhood in her childish breast console
her for the time for her need of her own mother. Such a doll as that she had never seen, not
even in the store-windows at Christmas-time. Still, she had very fine dolls for a little girl
whose relatives were not wealthy, but this doll was like a princess, and nearly as large as Ellen.

Ellen held out her arms for this ravishing creature in a French gown, looked into its countenance
of unflinching infantile grace and amiability and innocence, and her fickle heart betrayed
her, and she laughed with delight, and the tension of anxiety relaxed in her face.

"Where is her mother?" she asked of Cynthia, having a very firm belief in the little girl-motherhood
of dolls. She could not imagine a doll without her little mother, and even in the cases of
the store-dolls, she wondered how their mothers could let them be sold, and mothered by other
little girls, however poor they might be. But she never doubted that her own dolls were her
very own children even if they had been bought in a store. So now she asked Cynthia with an
indescribably pitying innocence, "Where is her mother?"

Cynthia laughed and looked adoringly at the child with the doll in her arms. "She has no mother
but you," said she. "She is yours, but once she belonged to a dear little boy, who used to
live with me."

Ellen stared thoughtfully: she had never seen a little boy with a doll. The lady seemed to
read her thought, for she laughed again.

"This little boy had curls, and he wore dresses like a little girl, and he was just as pretty
as a little girl, and he loved to play with dolls like a little girl," said she.

"Where is he?" asked Ellen, in a small, gentle voice. "Don't he want her now?"

"No, darling," said Cynthia; "he is not here; he has been gone away two years, and he had left
off his baby curls and his dresses, and stopped playing with her for a year before that." 
Cynthia sighed and drew down her mouth, and Ellen looked at her lovingly and wonderingly.

"Be you his mother?" she asked, piteously; then, before Cynthia could answer, her own lip quivered
and she sobbed out again, even while she hugged her doll-child to her bosom, "I want my mother!
I want my mother!"

All that day the struggle went on. Cynthia Lennox, leading her little guest, who always bore
the doll, traversed the fine old house in search of distraction, for the heart of the child
was sore for its mother, and success was always intermittent. The music-box played, the pictures
were explained, and even old trunks of laid-away treasures ransacked. Cynthia took her through
the hot-houses and gave her all the flowers she liked to pick, to still that longing cry of
hers. Cynthia Lennox had fine hot-houses kept by an old colored man, the husband of her black
cook. Her establishment was very small; her one other maid she had sent away early that morning
to make a visit with a sick sister in another town. The old colored couple had lived in her
family since she was born, and would have been silent had she stolen a whole family of children.
Ellen caught a glimpse of a bent, dark figure at one end of the pink-house as they entered;
he glanced up at her with no appearance of surprise, only a broad, welcoming expansion of his
whole face, which caused her to shrink; then he shuffled out in response to an order of his
mistress.

Ellen stared at the pinks, swarming as airily as butterflies in motley tints of palest rose
to deepest carmine over the blue-green jungle of their stems; she sniffed the warm, moist,
perfumed atmosphere; she followed Cynthia down the long perspective of bloom, then she said
again that she wanted her mother; and Cynthia led her into the rose-house, then into one where
the grapes hung low overhead and the air was as sweet and strong as wine, but even there Ellen
wanted her mother.

But it was not until the next morning when she was eating her breakfast that the climax came.
Then the door-bell rang, and presently Cynthia was summoned into another room. She kissed Ellen,
and bade her go on with her breakfast and she would return shortly; but before she had quite
left the room a man stood unexpectedly in the door-way, a man who looked younger than Cynthia.
He had a fair mustache, a high forehead scowling over near-sighted blue eyes, and stood with
a careless slouch of shoulders in a gray coat.

"Good-morning," he began. Then he stopped short when he saw Ellen in her tall chair staring
shyly around at him through her soft golden mist of hair. "What child is that?" he demanded;
but Cynthia with a sharp cry sprang to him, and fairly pulled him out of the room, and closed
the door.

Then Ellen heard voices rising higher and higher, and Cynthia say, in a voice of shrill passion:
"I cannot, Lyman. I cannot give her up. You don't know what I have suffered since George married
and took little Robert away. I can't let this child go."

Then came the man's voice, hoarse with excitement: "But, Cynthia, you must; you are mad. Think
what this means. Why, if people know what you have done, kept this child, while all this search
has been going on, and made no effort to find out who she was--"

"I did ask her, and she would not tell me," Cynthia said, miserably.

"Good Lord! what of that? That is nothing but a subterfuge. You must have seen in the papers--"

"I have not looked at a paper since she came."

"Of course you have not. You were afraid to. Why, good God! Cynthia Lennox, I don't know but
you will stand in danger of lynching if people ever find this out, that you have taken in this
child and kept her in this way--I don't know what people will do."

Ellen waited for no more; she rose softly, she gathered up her great doll which sat in a little
chair near by, she gathered up her pink-and-gold cup which had been given her, and the pinks
which had been brought from the hot-house the day before, which Cynthia had arranged in a vase
beside her plate, then she stole very softly out of the side door, and out of the house, and
ran down the street as fast as her little feet could carry her.

Chapter V

That morning, after the street in front of Lloyd's factory had been cleared of the flocking
employés with their little dinner-boxes, and the great broadside of the front windows had been
set with faces of the workers, a distracted figure came past. A young fellow at a window of
the cutting-room noticed her first. "Look at that, Jim Tenny," said he, with a shove of an
elbow towards his next neighbor.

"Get out, will ye?" growled Jim Tenny, but he looked.

Then three girls from the stitching-room came crowding up behind with furtively tender pressings
of round arms against the shoulders of the young men. "We come in here to see if that was Eva
Loud," said one, a sharp-faced, alert girl, not pretty, but a favorite among the male employés,
to the constant wonder of the other girls.

"Yes, it's her fast enough," rejoined another, a sweet-faced blonde with an exaggeratedly fashionable
coiffure and a noticeable smartness in the tie of her neck-ribbon and the set of her cotton
waist. "Just look at the poor thing's hair. Only see how frowsly it is, and she has come out
without her hat."

"Well, I don't wonder," said the third girl, who was elderly and whose complexion was tanned
and weather-beaten almost to the color of the leather upon which she worked. Yet through this
seamed and discolored face, with thin grayish hair drawn back tightly from the temples, one
could discern, as through a transparent mask, a past prettiness and an exceeding gentleness
and faithfulness. "If my sister's little Helen was to be lost I shouldn't know whether my hat
was on or not," said she. "I believe I should go raving mad."

"You wouldn't have to slave as you have done supportin' it ever since your sister's husband
died," said the pretty girl. "Only look how Eva's waist bags in the back and she 'ain't got
any belt on. I wouldn't come out lookin' so."

"I should die if I didn't have something to work for. That's the difference between being a
worker and a slave," said the other girl, simply. "Poor Eva!"

"Well, it was a pretty young one," said the first girl.

"Looks to me as if Eva Loud's skirt was comin' off," said the pretty girl. She pressed close
to Jim Tenny with a familiar air of proprietorship as she spoke, but the young man did not
seem to heed her. He was looking over his bench at the figure on the street below, and his
heavy black eyebrows were scowling, and his mouth set.

Jim Tenny was handsome after a swarthy and grimy fashion, for the tint of the leather seemed
to have become absorbed into his skin. His black mustache bristled roughly, but his face was
freer than usual from his black beard-stubble, because the day before had been Sunday and he
had shaved. His black right hand with its squat discolored nails grasped his cutting-knife
with a hard clutch, his left held the piece of leather firmly in place, while he stared out
with that angry and anxious scowl at Eva, who had paused on the street below, and was staring
up at the windows, as if she meditated a wild search in the factory for the lost child. There
was a curious likeness between the two faces; people had been accustomed to say that Eva Loud
and her gentleman looked more like brother and sister than a courting couple, and there was,
moreover, a curious spirit of comradeship between the two. It asserted itself now with the
young man, in opposition to the more purely sexual attraction of the pretty girl who was leaning
against him, and for whom he had deserted Eva.

After all, friendship and good comradeship are a steadier force than love, if not as overwhelming,
and it may be that tortoise of the emotions which outruns the hare.

"Well, for my part, I think a good deal more of Eva Loud than if she had come out all frizzed
and ruffled--shows her heart is in the right place," said the man who had spoken first. He
spoke with a guttural drawl, and kept on with his work, but there was a meaning in his words
for the pretty girl, who had coquetted with him before taking up with Jim Tenny.

"That is so," said another man at Jim Tenny's right. "She is right to come out as she has done
when she is so anxious for the child." This man was a fair-haired Swede, and he spoke English
with a curious and careful precision, very different from the hurried, slurring intonations
of the other men. He had been taught the language by a philanthropic young lady, a college
graduate, in whose father's family he had lived when he first came to America, and in consequence
he spoke like a gentleman and had some considerable difficulty in understanding his companions.

"Eva Loud has had a damned hard time, take it all together," spoke out another man, looking
over is bench at the girl on the street. He was small and thin and wiry, a mass of brown-coated
muscles under his loose-hanging gingham shirt. He plied feverishly his cutting-knife with his
lean, hairy hands as he spoke. He was accounted one of the best and swiftest cutters in Lloyd's,
and he worked unceasingly, for he had an invalid wife and four children to support. Now and
then he had to stop to cough, then he worked faster.

"That's so," said the first man.

"Yes, that is so," said the Swede, with a nod of his fair head.

"And now to lose this young one that she set her life by," said the first girl, with an evident
point of malice in her tone, and a covert look at the pretty girl at Jim Tenny's side. Jim
Tenny paled under his grime; the hand which held the knife clinched.

"What do you s'pose has become of the young one?" said the first girl. "There's a good many
out from the shop huntin' this mornin', ain't there?"

"Fifty," said the first man, laconically.

"You three were out all day yesterday, wa'n't you?"

"Yes, Jim and Carl and me were out till after midnight."

"Well, I wonder whether the poor little young one is alive? Don't seem as if she could be--but--"

"Look there! look there!" screamed the elderly girl suddenly. "Look at there!"  She began to
dance, she laughed, she sobbed, she waved her lean hands frantically out of the window, leaning
far over the bench. "Look at there!" she kept crying. Then she turned and ran out of the room,
with the other girls and half the cutting-room after her.

"Damn it, she's got the child!" said the thin man. He kept on working, his dark, sinewy hands
flying over the sheets of leather, but the tears ran down his cheeks. Lloyd's emptied itself
into the street, and surrounded Eva Loud and Ellen, who, running aimlessly, had come straight
to her aunt. Jim Tenny was first.

Eva stood clasping the child, who was too frightened to cry, and was breathing in hushed gasps,
her face hidden on her aunt's broad bosom. Eva had caught her up at the first sight of her,
and now she stood clasping her fiercely, and looking at them all as if she thought they wanted
to rob her of the child. Even when a great cheer went up from the crowd, and was echoed by
another from the factory, with an accompaniment of waving bare, leather-stained arms and hands,
that expression of desperate defiance instead of the joy of recovery did not leave her face,
not until she saw Jim Tenny's face working with repressed emotion and met his eyes full of
the memory of old comradeship. Then her bold heart and her pride all melted and she burst out
in a great wail before them all.

"Oh, Jim!" she cried out. "Oh, Jim, I lost you, and then I thought I'd lost her! Oh, Jim!"

Then there was a chorus of feminine sobs, for Eva's wild weeping had precipitated the ready
sympathy of half the girls present. The men started a cheer to cover a certain chivalrous shamefacedness
which was upon them at the sight of the girl's grief, and another cheer from the factory echoed
it. Then came another sound, the great steam-whistle of Lloyd's; then the whistles of the other
neighboring factories responded, and people began to swarm out of them, and the windows to
fill with eager faces. Jim Tenny grasped Eva's arm with a grasp like a vise. "Come this way,"
said he, sharply. "Come this way, Eva."

"Oh, Jim! oh, Jim!" Eva sobbed again; but she followed him, little Ellen's golden fleece tossing
over her shoulder.

"She's got her; she's got her!" shouted the people.

Then the leather-stained hands gyrated, the cheers went up, and again the whistles blew.

Jim Tenny, with his hand on Eva's arm, pushed his way through the crowd.

"Where you goin', Jim?" asked the pretty girl at his elbow, but he pushed past her roughly,
and did not seem to hear. Eva's face was all inflamed and convulsed with sobs, but she did
not dream of covering it--she was full of the holy shamelessness of grief and joy. "Let me
see her! let me see her! Oh, the dear little thing, only look at her! Where have you been,
precious? Are you hungry? Oh, Nellie, she is hungry, I know! She looks thin. Run over to the
bakery and buy her some cookies, quick! Are you cold? Give her this sacque. Only look at her!
Kate, only look at her! Are you hurt, darling? Has anybody hurt you? If anybody has, he shall
be hung! Oh, you darling! Only see her, 'Liza."

But Jim Tenny, his mouth set, his black brows scowling, his hard grasp on Eva's arm, pushed
straight through the gathering crowd until they came to Clarkson's stables at the rear of Lloyd's,
where he kept his horse and buggy--for he lived at a distance from his work, and drove over
every morning. He pointed to a chair which a hostler had occupied, tilted against the wall,
for a morning smoke, after the horses were fed and watered, and which he had vacated to join
the jubilant crowd. "Sit down there," he said to Eva. Then he hailed a staring man coming out
of the office. "Here, help me in with my horse, quick!" said he.

The man stared still, with slowly rising indignation. He was portly and middle-aged, the senior
partner of the firm, who seldom touched his own horses of late years, and had a son at Harvard.
"What's to pay? What do you mean? Anybody sick?" he asked.

"Help me into the buggy with my horse!" shouted Jim Tenny. "I tell you the child is found,
and I've got to take it home to its folks."

"Don't they know yet? Is that it?"

"Yes, I tell you."  Jim was backing out his horse as he spoke.

Mr. Clarkson seized a harness and threw the collar over the horse's head, while Jim ran out
the buggy. When Mr. Clarkson lifted Eva and Ellen into the buggy he gave the child's head a
pat. "God bless it!" he said, and his voice broke.

The horse was restive. Jim took a leap into the buggy at Eva's side, and they were out with
a dash and a swift rattle. The crowd parted before them, and cheer after cheer went up. The
whistles sounded again. Then all the city bells rang out. They were signalling the other searchers
that the child was found. Jim and Eva and Ellen made a progress of triumph down the street.
The crowd pursued them with cheers of rejoicing; doors and windows flew open; the house-yards
were full of people. Jim drove as fast as he could, scowling hard to hide his tenderness and
pity. Eva sat by his side, weeping in her terrible candor of grief and joy, and Ellen's golden
locks tossed on her shoulder.

Chapter VI

As Jim Tenny, with Eva Loud and the child, drove down the road towards the Brewster house,
his horse and buggy became the nucleus of a gathering procession, shouting and exclaiming,
with voices all tuned to one key of passionate sympathy. There were even many women of the
poorer class who had no sense of indecency in following the utmost lead of their tender emotions.
Some of them bore children of their own in their arms, and were telling them with passionate
croonings to look at the other little girl in the carriage who had been lost, and gone away
a whole day and two nights from her mother. They often called out fondly to Ellen and Eva,
and ordered Jim to wait a moment that they might look at the poor darling. But Jim drove on
as fast as he was able, though he had sometimes to rein his horse sharply to avoid riding down
some lean racing boys, who would now and then shoot ahead of him with loud whoops of triumph.
Once as he drove he laid one hand caressingly over Eva's. "Poor girl!" he said, hoarsely and
shamefacedly, and Eva sobbed loudly. When Jim reached Mrs. Zelotes Brewster's house there was
a swift displacement of lights and shadows in a window, a door flew open, and the gaunt old
woman was at the wheel.

"Stop!" she cried. "Stop! Bring her in here to me! Let me have her! Give her to me; I have
got everything ready! Come, Ellen--come to grandmother!"

Then there was a mad rush from the opposite direction, and the child's mother was there, reaching
into the buggy with fierce arms of love and longing. "Give her to me!" she shrieked out. "Give
me my baby, Eva Loud! Oh, Ellen, where have you been?"

Fanny Brewster dragged her child from her sister's arms so forcibly that she seemed fairly
to fly over the wheel. Then she strained her to her hungry bosom, covering her with kisses,
wetting her soft face and yellow hair with tears.

"My baby, mother's darling, mother's baby!" she gasped out with great pants of satisfied love;
but another pair of lean, wiry old arms stole around the child's slender body.

"Give her to me!" demanded Mrs. Zelotes Brewster. "She is my son's child, and I have a right
to her! You will kill her, goin' on so over her. Give her to me! I have everything all ready
in my house to take care of her. Give her to me, Fanny Loud!"

"Keep your hands off her!" cried Fanny. "She's my own baby, and nobody's goin' to take her
away from me, I guess."

"Give her to me this minute!" said Mrs. Zelotes Brewster. "You'll kill her, goin' on so. You're
frightenin' her to death. Give her to me this minute!"

Ellen, meanwhile, that little tender blossom tossed helplessly by contending waves of love,
was weeping and trembling with joy at the feel of her mother's arms and with awe and terror
at this tempest of passion which she had evoked.

"Give her to me!" demanded Mrs. Zelotes Brewster.

The crowd who had followed stood gaping with working faces. The mothers wept over their own
children. Eva stood at her sister's elbow, with a hand on one of the child's, which was laid
over Fanny's shoulder. Jim Tenny had his face hidden on his horse's neck.

"Give her to me!" said Mrs. Zelotes again. "Give her to me, I say! I am her own grandmother!"

"And I am her own mother!" called out Fanny, with a great master-note of love and triumph and
defiance. "I'm her own mother, and I've got her, and nobody but God shall take her from me
again." As she would have said to herself, she had been too busy. When girls at school had talked
of being in love, and of marrying, she had been interested, as if
in a story-book, but it had not seemed to her that she would ever
fall in love or be married.

 She was kneeling there with her Bible at her side, a sudden sweet humility of
thankfulness rising from her whole spirit like a perfume, when Fanny, with Eva following, still
clinging to the child's little hand over her sister's shoulder, went across the yard to her
own house to tell her husband. The others followed, and stood about outside, listening with
curiosity sanctified by intensest sympathy. One nervous-faced boy leaped on the slant of the
bulkhead to peer in a window of the sitting-room, and when his mother pulled him back forcibly,
rubbed his grimy little knuckles across his eyes, and a dark smooch appeared on his nose and
cheeks. He was a young boy, very small and thin for his age. He whispered to his mother and
she nodded, and he darted off in the direction of his own home.

Andrew Brewster had just come home after an all-night's search, and he was in his bedroom in
the bitter sleep of utter exhaustion and despair. Suddenly his heart had failed him and his
brain had reeled. He had begun to feel dazed, to forget for a minute what he was looking for.
He had made incoherent replies to the men with him, and finally one, after a whispered consultation
with the others, had said: "Look at here, Andrew, old fellow; you'd better go home and rest
a bit. We'll look all the harder while you're gone, and maybe she'll be found when you wake up."

"Who will be found?" Andrew asked, with a dazed look. He reeled as if he were drunk.

"Ain't had anything, has he?" one of the men whispered.

"Not a drop to my knowledge."

Andrew's lips trembled perceptibly; his forehead was knitted with vacuous perplexity; his eyes
reflected blanks of unreason; his whole body had an effect of weak settling and subsidence.
The man who worked next to him in the cutting-room at Lloyd's, and had searched at his side
indefatigably from the first, stole a tender hand under his shoulder. "Come along with me,
old man," he said, and Andrew obeyed.

When Fanny and Eva came in with the child, he lay prostrate on the bed, and scarcely seemed
to breathe. A great qualm of fear shot over Fanny for a second. His father had died of heart-disease.

"Is he--dead?" she gasped to Eva.

"No, of course he ain't," said Eva. "He's asleep; he's wore out. Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, wake
up! She's found, Andrew; Ellen's found."  But Andrew did not stir.

"He is!" gasped Fanny, again.

"No, he ain't. Andrew, Andrew Brewster, wake up, wake up! Ellen's here! She's found!"

Fanny put Ellen down, and bent over Andrew and listened. "No, I can hear him breathe," she
cried. Then she kissed him, and leaned her mouth close to his ear. "Andrew!" she said, in a
voice which Eva and Ellen had never heard before. "Andrew, poor old man, wake up; she's found!
Our child is found!"

When Andrew still did not wake, but only stirred, and moaned faintly, Fanny lifted Ellen onto
the bed. "Kiss poor father, and wake him," she told her.

Ellen, whose blue eyes were big with fright and wonder, whose lips were quivering, and whose
little body was vibrating with the strain of her nerves, laid her soft cheek against her father's
rough, pale one, and stole a little arm under his neck. "Father, wake up!" she called out in
her little, trembling, sweet voice, and that reached Andrew Brewster in the depths of his own
physical inertness. He opened his eyes and looked at the child, and the light came into them,
and then the sound of his sobbing filled the house and reached the people out in the yard,
and an echo arose from them. Gradually the crowd dispersed. Jim Tenny, before he drove away,
went to the door and spoke to Eva.

"Anything I can do?" he asked, with a curious, tender roughness. He did not look at her as
he spoke.

"No; thank you, Jim," replied Eva.

Suddenly the young man reached out a hand and stroked her rough hair. "Well, take care of yourself,
old girl," he said.

Eva went to her sister as Jim went out of the yard. Ellen was in the sitting-room with her
father, and Fanny had gone to the kitchen to heat some milk for the child, whom she firmly
believed to have had nothing to eat during her absence.

"Fanny," said Eva.

"Well?" said Fanny. "I can't stop; I must get some milk for her; she must be 'most starved."

Fanny turned and looked at Eva, who cast down her eyes before her in a very shamefacedness
of happiness and contrition.

"Why, what is it?" repeated Fanny, staring at her.

"I've got Jim back, I guess, as well as Ellen," said Eva, "and I'm going to be a good woman."

After all the crowd of people outside had gone, the little nervous boy raced into the Brewster
yard with a tin cup of chestnuts in his hand. He knocked at the side door, and when Fanny opened
it he thrust them upon her. "They're for her!" he blurted out, and was gone, racing like a deer.

"Don't you want the cup back?" Fanny shouted after him.

"No, ma'am," he called back, and that, although his mother had charged him to bring back the
cup or he would get a scolding.

Chapter VII

Ellen had clung fast all the time to her doll, her bunch of pinks, and her cup and saucer;
or, rather, she had guarded them jealously. "Where did you get all these things?" her aunt
Eva had asked her, amazedly, when she first caught sight of her, and then had not waited for
an answer in her wild excitement of joy at the recovery of the child. The great, smiling wax
doll had ridden between Jim and Eva in the buggy, Eva had held the pink cup and saucer with
a kind of mechanical carefulness, and Ellen herself clutched the pinks in one little hand,
though she crushed them against her aunt's bosom as she sat in her lap. Ellen's grandmother
and aunt had glanced at these treasures with momentary astonishment, and so had her mother,
but curiosity was in abeyance for both of them for the time; rapture at the sight of the beloved
child at whose loss they had suffered such agonies was the one emotion of their souls. But
later investigation was to follow.

When Ellen did not seem to care for her hot milk liberally sweetened in her own mug, and griddle-cakes
with plenty of syrup, her mother looked at her, and her eyes of love sharpened with inquiry.
"Ain't you hungry?" she said. Ellen shook her head. She was sitting at the table in the dining-room,
and her father, mother, and aunt were all hovering about her, watching her. Some of the neighbor
women were also in the room, staring with a sort of deprecating tenderness of curiosity.

"Do you feel sick?" Ellen's father inquired, anxiously.

"You don't feel sick, do you?" repeated her mother.

Ellen shook her head.

Just then Mrs. Zelotes Brewster came in with her black-and-white-checked shawl pinned around
her gaunt old face, which had in it a strange softness and sweetness, which made Fanny look
at her again, after the first glance, and not know why.

"We've got our blessing back again, mother," said her son Andrew, in a broken voice.

"But she won't eat her breakfast, now mother has gone and cooked it for her, so nice, too,"
said Fanny, in a tone of confidence which she had never before used towards Mrs. Zelotes.

"You don't feel sick, do you, Ellen?" asked her grandmother.

Ellen shook her head. "No, ma'am," said she.

"She says she don't feel sick, and she ain't hungry," Andrew said, anxiously.

"I wonder if she would eat one of my new doughnuts. I've got some real nice ones," said a neighbor--the
stout woman from the next house, whose breadth of body seemed to symbolize a corresponding
spiritual breadth of motherliness, as she stood there looking at the child who had been lost
and was found.

"Don't you want one of Aunty Wetherhed's nice doughnuts?" asked Fanny.

"No; I thank you," replied Ellen. Eva started suddenly with an air of mysterious purpose, opened
a door, ran down cellar, and returned with a tumbler of jelly, but Ellen shook her head even
at that.

"Have you had your breakfast?" said Fanny.

Then Ellen was utterly quiet. She did not speak; she made no sign or motion. She sat still,
looking straight before her.

"Don't you hear, Ellen?" said Andrew. "Have you had your breakfast this morning?"

"Tell Auntie Eva if you have had your breakfast," Eva said.

Mrs. Zelotes Brewster spoke with more authority, and she went further.

"Tell grandmother if you have had your breakfast, and where you had it," said she.

But Ellen was dumb and motionless. They all looked at one another. "Tell Aunty Wetherhed: that's
a good girl," said the stout woman.

"Where are those things she had when I first saw her?" asked Mrs. Zelotes, suddenly. Eva went
into the sitting-room, and fetched them out--the bunch of pinks, the cup and saucer, and the
doll. Ellen's eyes gave a quick look of love and delight at the doll.

"She had these, luggin' along in her little arms, when I first caught sight of her comin',"
said Eva.

"Where did you get them, Ellen?" asked Fanny. "Who gave them to you?"

Ellen was silent, with all their inquiring eyes fixed upon her face like a compelling battery.
"Where have you been, Ellen, all the time you have been gone?" asked Mrs. Zelotes. "Now you
have got back safe, you must tell us where you have been."

Andrew stooped his head down to the child's, and rubbed his rough cheek against her soft one,
with his old facetious caress. "Tell father where you've been," he whispered. Ellen gave him
a little piteous glance, and her lip quivered, but she did not speak.

"Where do you s'pose she got them?" whispered one neighbor to another.

"I can't imagine; that's a beautiful doll."

"Ain't it? It must have cost a lot. I know, because my Hattie had one her aunt gave her last
Christmas; that one cost a dollar and ninety-eight cents, and it didn't begin to compare with
this. That's a handsome cup and saucer, too."

"Yes, but you can get real handsome cups and saucers to Crosby's for twenty-five cents. I don't
think so much of that."

"Them pinks must have come from a greenhouse."

"Yes, they must."

"Well, there's lots of greenhouses in the city besides the florists. That don't help much."
Then the first woman inclined her lips closely to the other woman's ear and whispered, causing
the other to start back. "No, I can't believe she would," said she.

"She came from those Louds on her mother's side," whispered the first woman, guardedly, with
dark emphasis.

"Ellen," said Fanny, suddenly, and almost sharply, "you didn't take those things in any way
you hadn't ought to, did you? Tell mother."

"Fanny!" cried Andrew.

"If she did, it's the first time a Brewster ever stole," said Mrs. Zelotes. Her face was no
longer strange with unwonted sweetness as she looked at Fanny.

Andrew put his face down to Ellen's again. "Father knows she didn't steal the things; never
mind," he whispered.

Suddenly the stout woman made a soft, ponderous rush out of the room and the house. She passed
the window with oscillating swiftness.

"Where's Miss Wetherhed gone?" said one woman to another.

"She's thought of somethin'."

"Maybe she left her bread in the oven."

"No, she's thought of somethin'."

A very old lady, who had been sitting in a rocking-chair on the other side of the room, rose
trembling and came to Ellen and leaned over her, looking at her with small, black, bright eyes
through gold-rimmed spectacles. The old woman was deaf, and her voice was shrill and high-pitched
to reach her own consciousness. "What did such a good little girl as you be run away from father
and mother for?" she piped, going back to first principles and the root of the whole matter,
since she had heard nothing of the discussion which had been going on about her, and had supposed
it to deal with them.

Ellen gasped. Suddenly all her first woe returned upon her recollection. She turned innocent,
accusing eyes upon her father's loving face, then her mother's and aunt's. "You said--you said--you--"
she stammered out, but then her father and mother were both down upon their knees before her
in her chair embracing her, and Eva, too, seized her little hands. "You mustn't ever think
of what you heard father and mother say, Ellen," Andrew said, solemnly. "You must forget all
about it. Father and mother were both very wrong and wicked--"

"And Aunt Eva, too," sobbed Eva.

"And they didn't mean what they said," continued Andrew. "You are the greatest blessing in
this whole world to father and mother; you're all they have got. You don't know what father
and mother have been through, thinking you were lost and they might never see their little
girl again. Now you mustn't ever think of what they said again."

"And you won't ever hear them say it again, Ellen," Fanny Brewster said, with a noble humbling
of herself before her child.

"No, you won't," said Eva.

"Mother is goin' to try to do better, and have more patience, and not let you hear such talk
any more," said Fanny, kissing Ellen passionately, and rising with Andrew's arm around her.

"I'm going to try, too, Ellen," said Eva.

The stout woman came padding softly and heavily into the room, and there was a bright-blue
silken gleam in her hand. She waved a whole yard of silk of the most brilliant blue before
Ellen's dazzled eyes. "There!" said she, triumphantly, "if you will tell Aunty Wetherhed where
you've been, and all about it, she'll give you all this beautiful silk to make a new dress
for your new dolly."

Ellen looked in the woman's face, she looked at the blue silk, and she looked at the doll,
but she was silent.

"Only think what a beautiful dress it will make!" said a woman.

"And see how pretty it goes with the dolly's light hair," said Fanny.

"Ellen," whispered Andrew, "you tell father, and he'll buy you a whole pound of candy down
to the store."

"I shouldn't wonder if I could find something to make your dolly a cloak," said a woman.

"And I'll make her a beautiful little bonnet, if you'll tell," said another.

"Only think, a whole pound of candy!" said Andrew.

"I'll buy you a gold ring," Eva cried out--"a gold ring with a little blue stone in it."

"And you shall go to ride with mother on the cars to-morrow," said Fanny.

"Father will get you some oranges, too," said Andrew.

But Ellen sat silent and unmoved by all that sweet bribery, a little martyr to something within
herself; a sense of honor, love for the lady who had concealed her, and upon whom her confession
might bring some dire penalty; or perhaps she was strengthened in her silence by something
less worthy--possibly that stiff-neckedness which had descended to her from a long line of
Puritans upon her father's side. At all events she was silent, and opposed successfully her
one little new will to the onslaught of all those older and more experienced ones before her,
though nobody knew at what cost of agony to herself. She had always been a singularly docile
and obedient child; this was the first persistent disobedience of her whole life, and it reacted
upon herself with a cruel spiritual hurt. She sat clasping the great doll, the pinks, and the
pink cup and saucer before her on the table--a lone little weak child, opposing her single
individuality against so many, and to her own hurt and horror and self-condemnation, and she
did not weaken; but all at once her head drooped on one side, and her father caught her.

"There! you can all stop tormentin' this blessed child!" he cried. "Ellen, Ellen, look at Father!
Oh, mother, look here; she's fainted dead away!"

"Fanny!"

When Ellen came to herself she was on the bed in her mother's room, and her aunt Eva was putting
some of her beautiful cologne on her head, and her mother was trying to make her drink water,
and her grandmother had a glass of her currant wine, and they were calling to her with voices
of far-off love, as if from another world.

And after that she was questioned no more about her mysterious journey.

"Wherever she has been, she has got no harm," said Mrs. Zelotes Brewster, "and there's no use
in trying to drive a child, when it comes of our family. She's got some notion in her head,
and you've got to leave her alone to get over it. She's got back safe and sound, and that's
the main thing."

"I wish I knew where she got those things," Fanny said. Looseness of principle as to property
rights was not as strange to her imagination as to that of her mother-in-law.

For a long time afterwards she passed consciously and uneasily by cups and saucers in stores,
and would not look their way lest she should see the counterpart of Ellen's, which was Sèvres,
and worth more than the whole counterful, had she only known it, and she hurried past the florists
who displayed pinks in their windows. The doll was evidently not new, and she had not the same
anxiety with regard to that.

No one was allowed to ask Ellen further questions that day, not even the reporters, who went
away quite baffled by this infantile pertinacity in silence, and were forced to draw upon their
imaginations, with results varying from realistic horrors to Alice in Wonderland. Ellen was
kissed and cuddled by some women and young girls, but not many were allowed to see her. The
doctor had been called in after her fainting-fit, and pronounced it as his opinion that she
was a very nervous child, and had been under a severe strain, and he would not answer for the
result if she were to be further excited.

"Let her have her own way: if she wants to talk, let her, and if she wants to be silent, let
her alone. She is as delicate as that cup," said the doctor, looking at the shell-like thing
which Ellen had brought home, with some curiosity.

Chapter VIII

That evening Lyman Risley came to see Cynthia. He looked at her anxiously and scrutinizingly
when he entered the room, and did not respond to her salutation.

"Well, I have seen the child," he said, in a hushed voice, with a look towards the door as
he seated himself before the fire and spread out his hands towards the blaze. He looked nervous
and chilly.

"How did she look?" asked Cynthia.

"Why in the name of common-sense, Cynthia," he said, abruptly, without noticing her query,
"if you had to give that child china for a souvenir, didn't you give her something besides
Royal Sèvres?" Lyman Risley undoubtedly looked younger than Cynthia, but his manner even more
than his looks gave him the appearance of comparative youth. There was in it a vehemence and
impetuosity almost like that of a boy. Cynthia, with her strained nervous intensity, seemed
very much older.

"Why not?" said she.

"Why not? Well, it is fortunate for you that those people have a knowledge for the most part
of the fundamental properties of the drama of life, such as bread-and-butter, and a table from
which to eat it, and a knife with which to cut it, and a bed in which to sleep, and a stove
and coal, and so on, and so on, and that the artistic accessories, such as Royal Sèvres, which
is no better than common crockery for the honest purpose of holding the tea for the solace
of the thirsty mouth of labor, is beneath their attention."

"How does the child look, Lyman?" asked Cynthia Lennox. She was leaning back in a great crimson-covered
chair before the fire, a long, slender, graceful shape, in a clinging white silk gown which
was a favorite of hers for house wear. The light in the room was subdued, coming mostly through
crimson shades, and the faint, worn lines on Cynthia's face did not show; it looked, with her
soft crown of gray hair, like a cameo against the crimson background of the chair. The man
beside her looked at her with that impatience of his masculine estate and his superior youth,
and yet with the adoration which nothing could conquer. He had passed two-thirds of his life,
metaphorically, at this woman's feet, and had formed a habit of admiration and lovership which
no facts nor developments could ever alter. He was frowning, he replied with a certain sharpness,
and yet he leaned towards her as he spoke, and his eyes followed her long, graceful lines and
noted the clear delicacy of her features against the crimson background. "How the child looked--how
the child looked; Cynthia, you do not realize what you did. You have not the faintest realization
of what it means for a woman to keep a lost child hidden away as you did, when its parents
and half the city were hunting for it. I tell you I did not know what the consequences might
be to you if it were found out. There is wild blood in a city like this, and even the staid
old New England stream is capable of erratic currents. I tell you I have had a day of dreadful
anxiety, and it was worse because I had to be guarded. I dared scarcely speak to any one about
the matter. I have listened on street corners; I have made errands to newspaper offices. I
meant to get you away if-- Well, never mind--I tell you, you do not realize what you did, Cynthia."

Cynthia glanced at him without moving her head, then she looked away, her face quivering slightly,
more as if from a reflection of his agitation than from her own. "You say you saw her," she said.

"This afternoon," the man went on, "I got fairly desperate. I resolved to go to the fountain-head
for information, and take my chances. So down I went to Maple Street, where the Brewsters live,
and I rang the front-door bell, and the child's aunt, a handsome, breathless kind of creature,
came and ushered me into the best parlor, and went into the next room--the sitting-room--to
call the others. I caught sight of enough women for a woman's club in the sitting-room. Then
Andrew Brewster came in, and I offered my legal services out of friendly interest in the case,
and in that way I found out what I wanted to. Cynthia, that child has not told."

Cynthia raised herself and sat straight, and her face flashed like a white flame. "Were they
harsh to her?" she demanded. "Were they cruel? Did they question her, and were they harsh and
cruel because she would not tell? Why did you not tell them yourself? Why did you not, Lyman
Risley? Why did you not tell the whole story rather than have that child blamed? Well, I will
go myself. I will go this minute. They shall not blame that darling. What do you think I care
for myself? Let them lynch me if they want to. I will go this minute!"  Cynthia sprang to her
feet, but Risley, with a hoarse shout under his breath, caught hold of her and forced her back.

"For God's sake, sit down, Cynthia!" he said. "Didn't you hear the door-bell? Somebody is coming."

The door-bell had in fact rung, and Cynthia had not noticed it. She lay back in her chair as
the door opened, and Mrs. Norman Lloyd entered. "Good-evening, Cynthia," she said, beamingly.
"I thought I would stop a few minutes on my way to meeting. I'm rather early. No, don't get
up," as Cynthia rose. "Don't get up; I can only stay a minute. Never mind about giving me a
chair, Mr. Risley--thank you. Yes, this is a real comfortable chair."  Mrs. Lloyd, seated where
the firelight played over her wide sweep of rich skirts, and her velvet fur-trimmed cloak and
plumed bonnet, beamed upon them with an expansive benevolence and kindliness. She was a large,
handsome, florid woman. Her grayish-brown hair was carefully crimped, and looped back from
her fat, pink cheeks, a fine shell-and-gold comb surmounted her smooth French twist, and held
her bonnet in place. She unfastened her cloak, and a diamond brooch at her throat caught the
light and blazed red like a ruby. She was the wife of Norman Lloyd, the largest shoe-manufacturer
in the place. There was between her and Cynthia a sort of relationship by marriage. Norman
Lloyd's brother George had married Cynthia's sister, who had died ten years before, and of
whose little son, Robert, Cynthia had had the charge. Now George, who was a lawyer in St. Louis,
had married again. Mrs. Norman had sympathized openly with Cynthia when the child was taken
from Cynthia at his father's second marriage. "I call it a shame," she had said, "giving that
child to a perfect stranger to bring up, and I don't see any need of George's marrying again,
anyway. I don't know what I should do if I thought Norman would marry again if I died. I think
one husband and one wife is enough for any man or woman if they believe in the resurrection.
It has always seemed to me that the answer to that awful question in the New Testament, as
to whose wife that woman who had so many husbands would be in the other world, meant that people
who had done so much marrying on earth would have to be old maids and old bachelors in heaven.
George ought to be ashamed of himself, and Cynthia ought to keep that child."

Ever since she had been very solicitously friendly towards Cynthia, who had always imperceptibly
held herself aloof from her, owing to a difference in degree. Cynthia had no prejudices of
mind, but many of nerves, and this woman was distinctly not of her sort, though she had a certain
liking for her. Every time she was brought in contact with her she had a painful sense of a
grating adjustment as of points of meeting which did not dovetail as they should. Norman Lloyd
represented one of the old families of the city, distinguished by large possessions and college
training, and he was the first of his race to engage in trade. His wife came from a vastly
different stock, being the daughter of a shoe-manufacturer herself, and the granddaughter of
a cobbler who had tapped his neighbor's shoes in his little shop in the L of his humble cottage
house. Mrs. Norman Lloyd was innocently unconscious of any reason for concealing the fact,
and was fond, when driving out to take the air in her fine carriage, of pointing out to any
stranger who happened to be with her the house where her grandfather cobbled shoes and laid
the foundation of the family fortune. "That all came from that little shop of my grandfather,"
she would say, pointing proudly at Lloyd's great factory, which was not far from the old cottage.
"Mr. Lloyd didn't have much of anything when I married him, but I had considerable, and Mr.
Lloyd went into the factory, and he has been blessed, and the property has increased until
it has come to this." Mrs. Lloyd's chief pride was in the very facts which others deprecated.
When she considered the many-windowed pile of Lloyd's, and that her husband was the recognized
head and authority over all those throngs of grimy men, walking with the stoop of daily labor,
carrying their little dinner-boxes with mechanical clutches of leather-tanned fingers, she
used to send up a prayer for humility, lest evil and downfall of pride come to her. She was
a pious woman, a member of the First Baptist Church, and active in charitable work. Mrs. Norman
Lloyd adored her husband, and her estimate of him was almost ludicrously different from that
of the grimy men who flocked to his factory, she seeing a most kindly spirited and amiable
man, devoting himself to the best interests of his employés, and striving ever for their benefit
rather than his own, and the others seeing an aristocrat by birth and training, who was in
trade because of shrewd business instincts and a longing for wealth and power, but who despised,
and felt himself wholly superior to, the means by which it was acquired.

"We ain't anything but the rounds of the ladder for Norman Lloyd to climb by, and he only sees
and feels us with the soles of his patent-leathers," one of the turbulent spirits in his factory
said. Mrs. Norman Lloyd would not have believed her ears had she heard him.

Mrs. Lloyd had not sat long before Cynthia's fire that evening before she opened on the subject
of the lost child. "Oh, Cynthia, have you heard--" she began, but Risley cut her short.

"About that little girl who ran away?" he said. "Yes, we have; we were just talking about her."

"Did you ever hear anything like it?" said Mrs. Lloyd. "They say they can't find out where
she's been. She won't tell. Don't you believe somebody has threatened her if she does?"

Cynthia raised herself and began to speak, but a slight, almost imperceptible gesture from
the man beside her stopped her.

"What did you say, Cynthia?"

"There is no accounting for children's freaks," said Risley, shortly and harshly. Mrs. Lloyd
was not thin-skinned; such a current of exuberant cordiality emanated from her own nature that
she was not very susceptible to any counter-force. Now, however, she felt vaguely and wonderingly,
as a child might have done, that for some reason Lyman Risley was rude to her, and she had
a sense of bewildered injury. Mrs. Lloyd was always, moreover, somewhat anxious as to the relations
between Cynthia and Lyman Risley. She heard a deal of talk about it first and last; and while
she had no word of unkind comment herself, yet she felt at times uneasy. "Folks do talk about
Cynthia and Lyman Risley keeping company so long," she told her husband; "it's as much as twenty
years. It does seem as if they ought to get married, don't you think so, Norman? Do you suppose
it is because the property was left that way--for you know Lyman hasn't got anything besides
what he earns--or do you suppose it is because Cynthia doesn't want to marry him? I guess it
is that. Cynthia never seemed to me as if she would ever care enough about any man to marry
him. I guess that's it; but I do think she ought to stop his coming there quite so much, especially
when people know that about her property."

Cynthia's property was hers on condition that her husband took her name if she married, otherwise
it was forfeited to her sister's child. "Catch a Risley ever taking his wife's name!" said
Mrs. Lloyd. "Of course Cynthia would be willing to give up the money if she loved him, but
I don't believe she does. It seems as if Lyman Risley ought to see it would be better for him
not to go there so much if they weren't going to be married."

So it happened when Risley caught up her question to Cynthia in that peremptory fashion, Mrs.
Lloyd felt in addition to the present cause some which had gone before for her grievance. She
addressed herself thereafter entirely and pointedly to Cynthia. "Did you ever see that little
girl, Cynthia?" said she.

"Yes," replied Cynthia, in a voice so strange that the other woman stared wonderingly at her.

"Ain't you feeling well, Cynthia?" she asked.

"Very well, thank you," said Cynthia.

"When did you see her?" asked Mrs. Lloyd. Cynthia opened her mouth as if to speak, then she
glanced at Risley, whose eyes held her, and laughed instead--a strange, nervous laugh. Happily,
Mrs. Lloyd did not wait for her answer. She had her own important information to impart. She
had in reality stopped for that purpose. "Well, I have seen her," she said. "I met her in front
of Crosby's one day last summer. And she was so sweet-looking I stopped and spoke to her--I
couldn't help it. She had beautiful eyes, and the softest light curls, and she was dressed
so pretty, and the flowers on her hat were nice. The embroidery on her dress was very fine,
too. Usually, you know, those people don't care about the fineness, as long as it is wide,
and showy, and bright-colored. I asked her what her name was, and she answered just as pretty,
and her mother told me how old she was. Her mother was a handsome woman, though she had an
up-and-coming kind of way with her. But she seemed real pleased to have me notice the child.
Where do you suppose she was all that time, Cynthia?"

"She was in some safe place, undoubtedly," said Risley, and again Mrs. Lloyd felt that she
was snubbed, though not seeing how nor why, and again she rebelled with that soft and gentle
persistency in her own course which was the only rebellion of which she was capable.

"Where do you suppose she was, Cynthia?" said she.

"I think some woman must have seen her, and coaxed her in and kept her, she was such a pretty
child," said Cynthia, defiantly and desperately. But the other woman looked at her in wonder.

"Oh, Cynthia, I can't believe that," said she. "It don't seem as if any woman could be so bad
as that when the child's mother was in such agony over her."  And then she added, "I can't
believe it, because it seems to me that if any woman was bad enough to do that, she couldn't
have given her up at all, she was such a beautiful child."  Mrs. Norman Lloyd had no children
of her own, and was given to gazing with eyes of gentle envy at pretty, rosy little girls,
frilled with white embroidery like white pinks, dancing along in leading hands of maternal
love. "It don't seem to me I could ever have given her up, if I had once been bad enough to
steal her," she said. "What put such an idea into your head, Cynthia?"

When the church-bell clanged out just then Lyman Risley had never been so thankful in his life.
Mrs. Lloyd rose promptly, for she had to lead the meeting, that being the custom among the
sisters in her church. "Well," said she, "I am thankful she is found, anyway; I couldn't have
slept a wink that night if I had known she was lost, the dear little thing. Good-night, Cynthia;
don't come to the door. Good-night, Mr. Risley. Come and see me, Cynthia--do, dear."

When Mrs. Norman Lloyd was gone, Risley looked at Cynthia with a long breath of relief, but
she turned to him with seemingly no appreciation of it, and repeated her declaration which
Mrs. Lloyd's coming had interrupted: "Lyman, I am going there to-night--this minute. Will you
go with me? No, you must not go with me. I am going!"  She sprang to her feet.

"Sit down, Cynthia," said Risley. "I tell you they were not harsh to her. You don't seem to
consider that they love the child--possibly better than you can--and would not in the nature
of things be harsh to her under such circumstances. Sit down and hear the rest of it."

"But they will be harsh by-and-by, after the first joy of finding her is over," said Cynthia.
"I will go and tell them the first thing in the morning, Lyman."

"You will do nothing so foolish. They are not only not insisting upon her telling her secret,
but announced to me their determination not to do so in the future. I wish you could have seen
that man's face when he told me what a delicate, nervous little thing his child was, and the
doctor said she must not be fretted if she had taken a notion not to tell; and I wish you could
have seen the mother and the aunt, and the grandmother, Mrs. Zelotes Brewster. They would all
give each other and themselves up to be torn of wild beasts first. It is easy to see where
the child got her extraordinary strength of will. They took me out in the sitting-room, and
there was a wild flurry of feminine skirts before me. I had previously overheard myself announced
as Lawyer Risley by the aunt, and the response from various voices that they were 'goin' if
he was comin' out in the sittin'-room.'  It always made them nervous to see lawyers. Well,
I followed the parents and the grandmother and the aunt out. I dared not refuse when they suggested
it, and I hoped desperately that the child would not remember me from that one scared glance
she gave at me this morning. But there she sat in her little chair, holding the doll you gave
her, and she looked up at me when I entered, and I have never in the whole course of my existence
seen such an expression upon the face of a child. Remember me? Indeed she did, and she promised
me with the faithfulest, stanchest eyes of a woman set in a child's head that she would not
tell; that I need not fear for one minute; that the lady who had given her the doll was quite
safe. She knew, and she must have heard what I said to you this morning. She is the most wonderful
child I have ever seen."

Cynthia had sank back in her chair. Lyman Risley put his cigar back between his lips; Cynthia
was quite still, her delicate profile towards him.

"I assure you there is not the slightest danger of their troubling the child because of her
silence, and you would do an exceedingly foolish thing, and its consequences would react not
upon yourself only, but--upon others, were you to confess the truth to them," he said after
a little. "You must think of others--of your friends, and of your sister's boy, whose loss
led you into this. This would--well, it would get into the papers, Cynthia."

"Do you think that the doll continued to please her?" asked Cynthia.

"Cynthia, I want you to promise," said her friend, persistently.

"Very well, I will promise, if you will promise to let me know the minute you hear that they
are treating her harshly because of her silence."

Suddenly Cynthia turned her face upon him. "Lyman," said she, "do you think that I could do
anything for her--"

"Do anything for her?" he repeated, vaguely.

"Yes; they cannot have money. They must be poor: the father works in the factory. Would they
allow me--"

The lawyer laughed. "Cynthia," he said, "you do not realize that pride finds its native element
in all strata of society, and riches are comparative. Let me inform you that these Brewsters,
of whom this child sprung, claim as high places in the synagogue as any of your Lennoxes and
Risleys, and, what is more, they believe themselves there. They have seen the tops of their
neighbors' heads as often as you or I. The mere fact of familiarity with shoe-knives and leather,
and hand-skill instead of brain-skill, makes no difference with such inherent confidence of
importance as theirs. The Louds, on the other side--the handsome aunt is a Loud--are rather
below caste, but they make up for it with defiance. And as for riches, I would have you know
that the Brewsters are as rich in their own estimation as you in yours; that they have possessions
which entirely meet their needs and their æsthetic longings; that not only does Andrew Brewster
earn exceedingly good wages in the shop, and is able to provide plenty of nourishing food and
good clothes, but even by-and-by, if he prospers and is prudent, something rather extra in
the way of education--perhaps a piano. I would have you know that there is a Rogers group on
a little marble-topped table in the front window, and a table in the side window with a worked
spread, on which reposes a red plush photograph album; that there is also a set of fine parlor
furniture, with various devices in the way of silken and lace scarfs over the corners and backs
of the chairs and sofa, and that there is a tapestry carpet; that in the sitting-room is a
fine crushed-plush couch, and a multiplicity of rocking-chairs; that there is a complete dining-set
in the next room, the door of which stood open, and even a side-board with red napkins, and
a fine display of glass, every whit as elegant in their estimation as your cut glass in yours.
The child's father owns his house and land free of encumbrance. He told me so in the course
of his artless boasting as to what he might some day be able to do for the precious little
creature of his own flesh and blood; and the grandmother owns her comfortable place next door,
and she herself was dressed in black silk, and I will swear the lace on her cap was real, and
she wore a great brooch containing hair of the departed, and it was set in pearl. What are
you going to do in the face of opulence like this, Cynthia?"

Cynthia did not speak; her face looked as still as if it were carved in ivory.

"Cynthia," said the man, in a harsh voice, "I did not dream you were so broken up over losing
that little boy of your sister's, poor girl."

Cynthia still said nothing, but a tear rolled down her cheek. Lyman Risley saw it, then he
looked straight ahead, scowling over his cigar. He seemed suddenly to realize in this woman
whom he loved something anomalous, yet lovely--a beauty, as it were, of deformity, an over-development
in one direction, though a direction of utter grace and sweetness, like the lip of an orchid.

Why should she break her heart over a child whom she had never seen before, and have no love
and pity for the man who had laid his best at her feet so long?

He saw at a flash the sweet yet monstrous imperfection of her, and he loved her better for it.

Chapter IX

After Ellen's experience in running away, she dreamed her dreams with a difference. The breath
of human passion had stained the pure crystal of her childish imagination; she peopled all
her air-castles, and sounds of wailing farewells floated from the White North of her fancy
after the procession of the evergreen trees in the west yard, and the cherry-trees on the east
had found out that they were not in the Garden of Eden. In those days Ellen grew taller and
thinner, and the cherubic roundness of her face lengthened into a sweet wistfulness of wonder
and pleading, as of one who would look farther, since she heard sounds and saw signs in her
sky which indicated more beyond. Andrew and Fanny watched her more anxiously than ever, and
decided not to send her to school before spring, though all the neighbors exclaimed at their
tardiness in so doing. "She'll be two years back of my Hattie gettin' into the high-school,"
said one woman, bluntly, to Fanny, who retorted, angrily,

"I don't care if she's ten years behind, if she don't lose her health."

"You wait and see if she's two years behind!" exclaimed Eva, who had just returned from the
shop, and had entered the room bringing a fresh breath of December air, her cheeks glowing,
her black eyes shining.

Eva was so handsome in those days that she fairly forced admiration, even from those of her
own sex whose delicacy of taste she offended. She had a parcel in her hand, which she had bought
at a store on her way home, for she was getting ready to be married to Jim Tenny. "I tell you
there don't nobody know what that young one can do," continued Eva, with a radiant nod of triumph.
"There ain't many grown-up folks round here that can read like her, and she's studied geography,
and she knows her multiplication-table, and she can spell better than some that's been through
the high-school. You jest wait till Ellen gets started on her schoolin'--she won't stay in
the grammar-school long, I can tell you that. She'll go ahead of some that's got a start now
and think they're 'most there."  Eva pulled off her hat, and the coarse black curls on her
forehead sprang up like released wire. She nodded emphatically with a good-humored combativeness
at the visiting woman and at her sister.

"I hope your cheeks are red enough," said Fanny, looking at her with grateful admiration.

The visiting woman sniffed covertly, and a retort which seemed to her exceedingly witty was
loud in her own consciousness. "Them that likes beets and pinies is welcome to them," she thought,
but she did not speak. "Well," said she, "folks must do as they think best about their own
children. I have always thought a good deal of an education myself. I was brought up that way."
She looked with eyes that were fairly cruel at Eva Loud and Fanny, who had been a Loud, who
had both stopped going to school at a very early age.

Then the rich red flamed over Eva's forehead and neck as well as her cheeks. There was nothing
covert about her, she would drag an ambushed enemy forth into the open field even at the risk
of damaging disclosures regarding herself.

"Why don't you say jest what you mean, right out, Jennie Stebbins?" she demanded. "You are
hintin' that Fanny and me never had no education, and twittin' us with it."

"It wa'n't our fault," said Fanny, no less angrily.

"No, it wa'n't our fault," assented Eva. "We had to quit school. Folks can live with empty
heads, but they can't with empty stomachs. It had to be one or the other. If you want to twit
us with bein' poor, you can, Jennie Stebbins."

"I haven't said anything," said Mrs. Stebbins, with a scared and injured air. "I'd like to
know what you're making all this fuss about? I don't know. What did I say?"

"If I'd said anything mean, I wouldn't turn tail an' run, I'd stick to it about one minute
and a half, if it killed me," said Eva, scornfully.

"You know what you was hintin' at, jest as well as we do," said Fanny; "but it ain't so true
as you and some other folks may think, I can tell you that. If Eva and me didn't go to school
as long as some, we have always read every chance we could get."

"That's so," said Eva, emphatically. "I guess we've read enough sight more than some folks
that has had a good deal more chance to read. Fanny and me have taken books out of the library
full as much as any of the neighbors, I rather guess."

"We've read every single thing that Mrs. Southworth has ever written," said Fanny, "and that's
sayin' considerable."

"And all Pansy's and Rider Haggard's," declared Eva, with triumph.

"And every one of The Duchess and Marie Corelli, and Sir Walter Scott, and George Macdonald,
and Laura Jean Libbey, and Charles Reade, and more, besides, than I can think of."

"Fanny has read 'most all Tennyson," said Eva, with loyal admiration; "she likes poetry, but
I don't very well. She has read most all Tennyson and Longfellow, and we've both read Queechee,
and St. Elmo, and Jane Eyre."

"And we've read the Bible through," said Fanny, "because we read in a paper once that that
was a complete education. We made up our minds we'd read it through, and we did, though it
took us quite a while."

"And we take Zion's Herald, and The Rowe Gazette, and The Youth's Companion," said Eva.

"And we've both of us learned Ellen geography and spellin' and 'rithmetic, till we know most
as much as she does," said Fanny.

"That's so," said Fanny. "I snum, I believe I could get into the high-school myself, if I wasn't
goin' to git married," said Eva, with a gay laugh. She was so happy in those days that her
power of continued resentment was small. The tide of her own bliss returned upon her full consciousness
and overflowed, and crested, as with glory, all petty annoyances.

The visiting woman took up her work, and rose to go with a slightly abashed air, though her
small brown eyes were still blanks of impregnable defence. "Well, I dunno what I've said to
stir you both so," she remarked again. "If I've said anythin' that riled you, I'm sorry, I'm
sure. As I said before, folks must do as they are a mind to with their own children. If they
see fit to keep 'em home from school until they're women grown, and if they think it's best
not to punish 'em when they run away, why they must. I 'ain't got no right to say anythin',
and I 'ain't."

"You--" began Fanny, and then she stopped short, and Eva began arranging her hair before the
glass. "The wind blew so comin' home," she said, "that my hair is all out."  The visiting woman
stared with a motion of adjustive bewilderment, as one might before a sudden change of wind,
then she looked, as a shadowy motion disturbed the even light of the room and little Ellen
passed the window. She knew at once, for she had heard the gossip, that the ready tongues of
recrimination were hushed because of the child, and then Ellen entered.

The winter afternoon was waning and the light was low; the child's face, with its clear fairness,
seemed to gleam out in the room like a lamp with a pale luminosity of its own.

The three women, the mother, and aunt, and the visiting neighbor, all looked at her, and Ellen
smiled up at them as innocently sweet as a flower. There was that in Ellen's smile and regard
at that time which no woman could resist. Suddenly the visiting neighbor laid a finger softly
under her chin and tilted up her little face towards the light. Then she said with that unconscious
poetry of bereavement which sees a likeness in all fair things of earth to the face of the
lost treasure, "I do believe she looks like my first little girl that died."

After the visiting woman had gone, Fanny and Eva calling after her to come again, they looked
at each other, then at Ellen. "That little girl that died favored the Stebbinses, and was dark
as an Injun," said Fanny, "no more like Ellen--"

"That's so," acquiesced Eva; "I remember that young one. Lookin' like Ellen--I'd like to see
the child that did look like her; there ain't none round these parts. I wish you could have
seen folks stare at her when I took her down street yesterday. One woman said, 'Ain't she pretty
as a picture,' so loud I heard it, but Ellen didn't seem to."

"Sometimes I wonder if we'll make her proud," Fanny said, in a hushed voice, with a look of
admiration that savored of worship at Ellen.

"She don't ever seem to notice," said Eva, with a hushed response. Indeed, Ellen had seemed
to pay no attention whatever to their remarks, whether from an innate humility and lack of
self-consciousness, or because she was so accustomed to adulation that it had become as the
breath of her nostrils, to be taken no more account of. She had seated herself in her favorite
place in a rocking-chair at a west window, with her chin resting on the sill, and her eyes
staring into the great out-of-doors, full of winds and skies and trees and her own imaginings.

She would sit so, motionless, for hours at a time, and sometimes her mother would rouse her
almost roughly. "What be you thinkin' about, settin' there so still?" she would ask, with eyes
of vague anxiety fixed upon her, but Ellen could never answer.

Though it was getting late, it did not seem dark as early as usual, since there was a full
moon and there was snow on the ground which gave forth a pale light in a wide surface of reflection.
However, the moon was behind clouds, for it was beginning to snow again quite heavily, and
the white flakes drove in whirlwinds past the street-lamp on the corner of the street. Now
and then a tramping and muffled figure came into the radius of light, then passed into the
white gloom beyond.

Fanny was preparing supper, and the light from the dining-room shone in where Ellen sat, but
the sitting-room was not lighted. Ellen began to smell the fragrance of tea and toast, and
there was a reflection of the dining-room table and lamp outside pictured vividly against the
white sheet of storm.

Ellen knew better, but it amused her to think that her home was out-of-doors as well as under
her father's and mother's roof. Eva passed her with her hands full of kindlings. She was going
to make a fire in the parlor-stove, for Jim Tenny was coming that evening. She laid a tender
hand on Ellen's head as she passed, and smoothed her hair. Ellen had a sort of acquiescent
wonder over her aunt Eva in those days. She heard people say Eva was getting ready to be married,
and speculated. "What is getting ready to be married?" she asked Eva.

"Why, getting your clothes made, you little ninny," Eva answered.

The next day Ellen had watched her mother at work upon a new little frock for herself for some
time before she spoke.

"Mother," she said.

"Yes, child."

"Mother, you are making that new dress for me, ain't you?"

"Of course I am; why?"

"And you made me a new coat last week?"

"Why, you know I did, Ellen; what do you mean?"

"And you are going to make me a petticoat and put that pretty lace on it?"

"You know I am, Ellen Brewster, what be you drivin' at?"

"Be I a-gettin' ready to be married, mother?" asked Ellen, with the strangest look of wonder
and awe and anticipation.

Fanny had told this saying of the child's to everybody, and that evening when Jim Tenny came
he caught up Ellen and gave her a toss to the ceiling, a trick of his which filled Ellen with
a sort of fearful delight, the delight of helplessness in the hands of strength, and the titillation
of evanescent risk.

"So you are gettin' ready to be married, are you?" Jim Tenny said, with a great laugh, looking
at her soberly, with big black eyes. Jim Tenny was a handsome fellow, and much larger and stronger
than her father. Ellen liked him; he often brought candies in his pocket for her, and they
were great friends, but she could never understand why he stayed in the parlor all alone with
her aunt Eva, instead of in the sitting-room with the others.

Ellen had looked back at him as soberly. "Mother says I 'ain't," she replied, "but--"

"But what?"

"I am getting most as many new clothes as Aunt Eva, and she is."

"And you think maybe you are gettin' ready to be married, after all, hey?"

"I think maybe mother wants to surprise me," Ellen said.

Jim Tenny had all of a sudden shaken convulsively as if with mirth, but his face remained perfectly
sober.

That evening after the parlor door was closed upon Jim and Eva, Ellen wondered what they were
laughing at.

To-night when she saw Eva enter the room, a lighted lamp illuminating her face fairly reckless
with happiness, to light the fire in the courting-stove as her sister facetiously called it,
she thought to herself that Jim Tenny was coming, that they would be shut up in there all alone
as usual, and then she looked out at the storm and the night again, and the little home picture
thrown against it. Then she saw her father coming into the yard with his arms full of parcels,
and she was out of her chair and at the kitchen door to meet him.

Andrew had brought as usual some dainties for his darling. He watched Ellen unwrap the various
parcels, not smiling as usual, but with a curious knitting of his forehead and pitiful compression
of mouth. When she had finished and ran into the other room to show a great orange to her aunt,
he drew a heavy sigh that was almost a groan. His wife coming in from the kitchen with a dish
heard him, and looked at him with quick anxiety, though she spoke in a merry, rallying way.

"For the land sake, Andrew Brewster, what be you groanin' that way for?" she cried out.

Andrew's tense face did not relax; he strove to push past her without a word, but Fanny stood
before him. "Now, look at here, Andrew," said she, "you 'ain't goin' to walk off with a face
like that, unless I know what the matter is. Are you sick?"

"No, I ain't sick, Fanny," Andrew said; then in a low voice, "Let me go, I will tell you by-and-by."

"No, Andrew, you have got to tell me now. I'm goin' to know whatever has happened."

"Wait till after supper, Fanny."

"No, I can't wait. Look here, Andrew, you are my husband, and there ain't no trouble that can
come to you in this world that I can't bear, except not knowin'. You've got to tell me what
the matter is."

"Well, keep quiet till after supper, then," said Andrew. Then suddenly he leaned his face close
to her and whispered with a hiss of tragedy, "Lloyd's shut down."

Fanny recoiled and looked at him.

"When?"

"The foreman gave notice to-night."

"For how long? Did he say?"

"Oh, till business got better--same old story. Unless I'm mistaken, Lloyd's will be shut down
all winter."

"Well, it ain't so bad for us as for some," said Fanny. Both pride and a wish to cheer her
husband induced her to say that. She did not like to think that, after the fine marriage she
had made, she needed to be as distressed at a temporary loss of employment as others. Then,
too, that look of overhanging melancholy in Andrew's face alarmed her; she felt that she must
drive it away at any cost.

"Seems to me it's bad enough for anybody," said Andrew, morosely.

"Now, Andrew, you know it ain't. Here we own the house clear, and we've got that money in the
savings-bank, and all that's your mother's is yours in the end. Of course we ain't always thinkin'
of that, and I'm sure I hope she'll outlive me, but it's so. You know we sha'n't starve if
you don't have work."

"We shall starve in the end, and you know I've been--"  Andrew stopped suddenly as he heard
Ellen and his sister-in-law coming. He shook his head at his wife with a warning motion that
she should keep silence.

"Don't Eva know?" she whispered.

"No, she came out early. Do for Heaven's sake keep quiet till after supper."

Eva was sharp-eyed, and all through supper she watched Andrew, and the lines of melancholy
on his face, which did not disappear even when he forced conversation.

"What in creation ails you, Andrew?" she burst out, finally. "You look like a walking funeral."

Andrew made no reply, and Fanny volunteered an answer. "He's all tired out," she said; "he's
got a little cold. Eat some more of the stew, Andrew; it'll do you good, it's nice and hot."

"You can't cheat me," said Eva. "There's something to pay."  She took a mouthful, then she
stared at Andrew, with a sudden pallor. "It ain't anythin' about Jim, is it?" she gasped out.
"Because if it is, there's no use in your waitin' to tell me, you might as well have it over
at once. You won't make it any easier for me, I can tell you that."

"No, it ain't anything about Jim, in the way you mean, Eva," her sister said, soothingly. "Eat
your supper and don't worry."

"What do you mean by that? Jim ain't sick?"

"No, I tell you; don't be a goose, Eva."

"He ain't been anywhere with--"

"Do keep still, Eva!" Fanny cried, impatiently. "If I didn't have any more faith than that
in a man, I'd give him up. I don't think you're fair to Jim. Of course he ain't been with that
girl, when he's goin' to marry you next month."

"I'm just as fair to Jim as he deserves," Eva said, simply. "I think just as much of him, but
what a man's done once he may do again, and I can't help it if I think of it, and he shouldn't
be surprised. He's brought it on himself. I've got as much faith in him as anybody can have,
seein' as he's a man. Well, if it ain't that, Andrew Brewster, what is it?"

"Now, you let him alone till after supper, Eva," Fanny said. "Do let him have a little peace."

"Well, I'll get it out of him afterwards," Eva said.

As soon as she got up from the table she pushed him into the sitting-room. "Now, out with it,"
said she. Ellen, who had followed them, stood looking at them both, her lips parted, her eyes
full of half-alarmed curiosity.

"Lloyd's has shut down, if you want to know," Andrew said, shortly.

"Oh my God!" cried Eva. Andrew shrank from her impatiently. She made that ejaculation because
she was a Loud, and had an off-streak in her blood. Not one of Andrew's pure New England stock
would have so expressed herself. He sat down beside the lamp and took up the evening paper.
Eva stood looking at him a minute. She was quite pale, she was weighing consequences. Then
she went out to her sister. "Well, you know what's happened, Fan, I s'pose," she said.

"Yes, I'm awful sorry, but I tell Andrew it ain't so bad for us as for some; we sha'n't starve."

"I don't know as I care much whether I starve or not," said Eva. "It's goin' to make me put
off my weddin'; and if I do put it off, Jim and me will never get married at all; I feel it
in my bones."

"Why, what should you have to put it off for?" asked Fanny.

"Why? I should think you'd know why without askin'. Ain't I spent every dollar I have saved
up on my weddin' fixin's, and Jim, he's got his mother on his hands, and she's been sick, and
he ain't saved up anything. If you s'pose I'm goin' to marry him and make him any worse off
than he is now you're mistaken."

"Well, mebbe Jim can work somewhere else, and mebbe Lloyd's won't be shut up long," Fanny said,
consolingly. "I wouldn't give up so, if I was you."

"I might jest as well," Eva returned. "It's no use, Jim and me will never get married."  Eva's
face was curiously set; she was not in the least loud nor violent as was usually the case when
she was in trouble, her voice was quite low, and she spoke slowly.

Fanny looked anxiously at her. "It ain't as though you hadn't a roof to cover you," she said,
"for you've got mine and Andrew's as long as we have one ourselves."

"Do you think I'd live on Andrew long?" demanded Eva.

"You won't have to. Jim will get work in a week or two, and you'll get married. Don't act so.
I declare, I'm ashamed of you, Eva Loud. I thought you had more sense, to give up discouraged
at no more than this. I don't see why you jump way ahead into trouble before you get to it."

"I've got to it, and I can feel the steam of it in my face," Eva said, with unconscious imagery.
Then she lit a lamp, and went up-stairs to change her dress before Jim Tenny arrived.

It was snowing hard. Ellen sat in her place by the window and watched the flakes drive past
the radiance of the street-lamp on the corner, and past the reflection of the warm, bright
room. Now she could see, since the light was in the room where she sat, her father beside the
table reading his paper, and shadowy images of all the familiar things projecting themselves
like a mirage of home into the night and storm. Ellen could see, even without turning round,
that her father looked very sober, and did not seem to be much interested in his paper, and
a vague sense of calamity oppressed her. She did not know just what might be involved in Lloyd's
shutting down, but she saw that her father and aunt were disturbed, and her imaginings were
half eclipsed by a shadow of material things. Ellen dearly loved this early evening hour when
she could stare out into the mystery of the night, herself sheltered under the wing of home,
and the fancies which her childish brain wove were as a garment of spirit for the future; but
to-night she did not dream so much as she wondered and reflected. Pretty soon Ellen saw a man's
figure plodding through the fast-gathering snow, and heard her aunt Eva make a soft, heavy
rush down the front stairs, and she knew the man was Jim Tenny, and her aunt had been watching
for him. Ellen wondered why she had watched up in her cold room, why she had not sat down-stairs
where it was warm, and let Jim ring the door-bell. Ellen liked Jim Tenny, but there was often
that in her aunt's eyes regarding him which made Ellen look past him and above him to see if
there was another man there. Ellen heard the fire crackling in the parlor-stove, and saw the
light shining under the parlor threshold, and heard the soft hum of voices. Her mother, having
finished washing up the supper dishes, came in presently and seated herself beside the lamp
with her needle-work.

"You don't feel any wind comin' in the window?" she said, anxiously, to Ellen.

"No, ma'am," replied Ellen.

Andrew looked up quickly. "You're sure you don't?" he said.

"No, sir."

Ellen watched her mother sewing out in the snowy yard, then a dark shadow came between the
reflection and the window, then another. Two men treading in the snow in even file, one in
the other's foot-tracks, came into the yard.

"Somebody's comin'," said Ellen, as a knock, came on the side door.

"Did you see who 'twas?" Fanny asked, starting up.

"Two men."

"It's somebody to see you, Andrew," Fanny said, and Andrew tossed his paper on the table and
went to the door.

When the door was opened Ellen heard a man cough.

"I should think anybody was crazy to come out such a night as this, coughin' that way," murmured
Fanny. "I do believe it's Joe Atkins; sounds like his cough."  Then Andrew entered with the
two men stamping and shaking themselves.

"Here's Joseph Atkins and Nahum Beals," Andrew said, in his melancholy voice, all unstirred
by the usual warmth of greeting. The two men bowed stiffly.

"Good-evenin'," Fanny said, and rose and pushed forward the rocking-chair in which she had
been seated to Joseph Atkins, who was a consumptive man with an invalid wife, and worked next
Andrew in Lloyd's.

"Keep your settin', keep your settin'," he returned in his quick, nervous way, as if his very
words were money for dire need, and sat himself down in a straight chair far from the fire.
The other man, Nahum Beals, was very young. He seated himself next to Joseph, and the two side
by side looked with gloomy significance at Andrew and Fanny. Then Joseph Atkins burst out suddenly
in a rattling volley of coughs.

"You hadn't ought to come out such a night as this, I'm afraid, Mr. Atkins," said Fanny.

"He's been out jest as bad weather as this all winter," said the young man, Nahum Beals, in
an unexpectedly deep voice. "The workers of this world can't afford to take no account of weather.
It's for the rich folks to look out betwixt their lace curtains and see if it looks lowery,
so they sha'n't git their gold harnesses and their shiny carriages, an' their silks an' velvets
an' ostrich feathers wet. The poor folks that it's life and death to have to go out whether
or no, no matter if they've got an extra suit of clothes or not. They've got to go out through
the drenchin' rain and the snow-drifts, to earn money so that the rich folks can have them
gold-plated harnesses and them silks and velvets. Joe's been out all winter in weather as bad
as this, after he's been standin' all day in a shop as hot as hell, drenched with sweat. One
more time won't make much difference."

"It would be 'nough sight better for me if it did," said Joseph Atkins, chokingly, and still
with that same seeming of hurry.

Fanny had gone out to the dining-room, and now she returned stirring some whiskey and molasses
in a cup.

"Here," said she, "you take this, Mr. Atkins; it's real good for a cough. Andrew cured a cold
with it last month."

"Mine ain't a cold, and it can't be cured in this world, but it's better for me, I guess,"
said Joe Atkins, chokingly, but he took the cup.

"Now, you hadn't ought to talk so," Fanny said. "You had ought to think of your wife and children."

"My life is insured," said Joseph Atkins.

"We ain't got no money and no jewelry, and no silver to leave them we love--all we've got to
leave 'em is the price of our own lives," said Nahum Beals.

"I wish I had got my life insured," Andrew said.

"Don't talk so, Andrew," Fanny cried, with a shudder.

"My life is insured for two thousand dollars," Joe Atkins said, with an odd sort of pride.
"I had it done three years ago. My lungs was sound as anybody's then, but that very next summer
I worked up under that tin roof, and came out as wet as if I'd been dipped in the river, into
an east wind, and got a chill. It was the only time I ever struck luck--to get insured before
that happened. Nobody'd look at me now, and I dunno what they'd do. I 'ain't laid up a cent,
I've had so much sickness in my family."

"If you hadn't worked that summer in the annex under that tin roof, you'd be as well as you
ever was now," said Nahum Beals.

"I worked there 'longside of you that summer," said Andrew to Joe, with bitter reminiscence.
"We used to strip like a gang of convicts, and we stood in pools of sweat. It was that awful
hot summer, and the room had only that one row of windows facing the east, and the wind never
that way."

"Not till I came out of the shop that night I took the chill," said Joe.

Suddenly the young man, Nahum Beals, hit his knees a sounding slap, which made Ellen, furtively
and timidly attentive at her window, jump. "It seems sometimes as if the Almighty himself was
in league with 'em," he shouted out, "but I tell you it won't last, it won't last."

"I don't see much sign of any change for the better," Andrew said, gloomily.

"I tell you, sir, it won't last," repeated Nahum Beals. "I tell you, the Lord only raises 'em
up higher and higher that He may dash 'em lower when the time comes. The same earth is beneath
the high places of this life, and the lowly ones, and the law that governs 'em is the same,
and--the higher the place the longer the fall, and the longer the fall the sorer the hurt."
Nahum Beals sprang to his feet with a strange abandon of self-consciousness and a fiery impetus
for one of his New England blood. He had a delicate, nervous face, like a woman's, his blue
eyes gleamed like blue flames under his overhang of white forehead, he shook his head as if
it were maned like a lion, and, though he wore his thin, fair hair short, one could seem to
see it flung back in glistening lines. He spread his hands as if he were addressing an audience,
and as he did so the parlor door opened and Jim Tenny and Eva stood there, listening.

"I tell you, sir," shouted Nahum Beals, "the time will come when you will all thank God that
you belong to the poor and down-trodden of this earth, and not to the rich and great--the time
will come. There's knives to sharpen to-day, and wood for scaffolds as plenty as in the days
of the French Revolution, and the hand that marks the time of day on the clock of men's patience
with wrong and oppression has near gone round to the same hour and minute."

Andrew Brewster looked at him, with a curious expression half of disgust, half of sympathy.
His sense of dignity in the face of adversity inherited from his New England race was shocked;
he was not one to be blindly swayed by another's fervor even when his own wrongs were in question.
He would not have made a good follower in a revolution, nor a leader. He would simply have
found his own place of fixed principle and abided there. Then, too, he had a judicial mind
which could combine the elements of counsels for and against his own cause.

"Now, look at here," he said, slowly, "I ain't goin' to say I don't think we ain't in a hard
place, and that there's somethin' wrong that's to blame for it, but I dunno but you go most
too far, Nahum; or, rather, I dunno as you go far enough. I dunno but we've got to dig down
past the poor and the rich, farther into the everlastin' foundations of things to get at what's
the trouble."

Jim Tenny, standing in the parlor doorway, with an arm around Eva's waist, broke in suddenly
with a defiant laugh. "I don't care nothin' about the everlastin' foundations of things, and
I don't care a darn about the rich and the poor," he proclaimed. "I'm willin' to leave that
to lecturers and dynamiters, and let 'em settle it if they can. I don't grudge the rich nothin',
and I ain't goin' to call the Almighty to account for givin' somebody else the biggest piece
of pie; mebbe it would give me the stomach-ache. All I'm concerned about is Lloyd's shut-down."

"That's so," said Eva.

"I tell you, sir, it ain't the facts of the case, but the reason for the facts, which we must
think of," maintained Nahum Beals.

"I don't care a darn for the facts nor the reasons," said Jim Tenny; "all I care about is I'm
out of work maybe till spring, with my mother dependent on me, and not a cent laid up, I've
been so darned careless, and here's Eva says she won't marry me till I get work."

"I won't," said Eva, who was very pale, except for burning spots on her cheeks.

"She's afraid she won't get frostin' on her cake, and silk dresses, I expect," Jim Tenny said,
and laughed, but his laugh was very bitter.

"Jim Tenny, you know better than that," Eva cried, sharply. "I won't stand that."

Jim Tenny, with a quick motion, unwound his arm from Eva's waist and stripped up his sleeve.
"There, look at that, will you," he cried out, shaking his lean, muscular arm at them; "look
at that muscle, and me tellin' her that I could earn a livin' for her, and she afraid. I can
dig if I can't make shoes. I guess there's work in this world for them that's willin', and
don't pick and choose."

"There ain't," declared Nahum, shortly.

"You can't dig when the ground's froze hard," Eva said, with literal meaning.

"Then I'll take a pickaxe," cried Jim.

"You can dig, but who's goin' to pay you for the diggin'?" demanded Nahum Beals.

"The idea of a girl's bein' afraid I wa'n't enough of a man to support a wife with an arm like
that," said Jim Tenny, "as if I couldn't dig for her, or fight for her."

"The fightin' has got to come first in order to get the diggin', and the pay for it," said Nahum.

"Now, look at here," Andrew Brewster broke in, "you know I'm in as bad a box as you, and I
come home to-night feelin' as if I didn't care whether I lived or died; but if it's true what
McGrath said to-night, we've got to use common-sense in lookin' at things even if it goes against
us. If what McGrath said was true, that Lloyd's losing money keeping on, I dunno how we can
expect him or any other man to do that."

"Why not he lose money as well as we?" demanded Nahum, fiercely.

"'Cause we 'ain't got none to lose," cried Jim Tenny, with a hard laugh, and Eva and Fanny
echoed him hysterically.

Nahum took no notice of the interruption. Tragedy, to his comprehension, never verged on comedy.
One could imagine his face of intense melancholy and denunciation relaxed with laughter no
more than that of the stern prophet of righteous retribution whose name he bore.

"Why shouldn't Norman Lloyd lose money?" he demanded again. "Why shouldn't he lose his fine
house as well as I my poor little home? Why shouldn't he lose his purple and fine linen as
well as Jim his chances of happiness? Why shouldn't he lose his diamond shirt-studs, and his
carriage and horses, as well as Joe his life?"

"Well, he earned his money, I suppose," Andrew said, slowly, "and I suppose it's for him to
say what he'll do with it."

"Earned his money? He didn't earn his money," cried Nahum Beals. "We earned it, every dollar
of it, by the sweat of our brows, and it's for us, not him, to say what shall be done with
it. Well, the time will come, I tell ye, the time will come."

"We sha'n't see it," said Joe Atkins.

"It may come sooner than you think," said Nahum. Then Nahum Beals, with a sudden access of
bitterness, broke in. "Look at Norman Lloyd," he cried, "havin' that great house, and horses
and carriages, and dressin' like a dude, and his wife rustlin' in silks so you can hear her
comin' a mile off, and shinin' like a jeweller's window--look at 'em all--all the factory bosses--livin'
like princes on the money we've earned for 'em; and look at their relations, and look at the
rich folks that ain't never earned a cent, that's had money left 'em. Go right up and down
the Main Street, here in this city. See the Lloyds and the Maguires and the Marshalls and the
Risleys and the Lennoxes--"

"There ain't none of the Lennoxes left except that one woman," said Andrew.

"Well, look at her. There she is without chick or child, rollin' in riches, and Norman Lloyd's
her own brother-in-law. Why don't she give him a little money to run the factory this winter,
so you and me won't have to lose everythin'?"

"I suppose she's got a right to do as she pleases with her own," said Andrew.

"I tell you she ain't," shouted Nahum. "She ain't the one to say, 'It's the Lord, and He's
said it.'  Cynthia Lennox and all the women like her are the oppressors of the poor. They are
accursed in the sight of the Lord, as were those women we read about in the Old Testament,
with their mantles and crisping-pins. Their low voices and their silk sweeps and their shrinkin'
from touchin' shoulders with their fellow-beings in a crowd don't alter matters a mite."

"Now, Nahum," cried Jim Tenny, with one of his sudden turns of base when his sense of humor
was touched, "you don't mean to say that you want Cynthia Lennox to give you her money?"

"I'd die, and see her dead, before I'd touch a dollar of her money!" cried Nahum--"before I'd
touch a dollar of her money or anything that was bought with her money, her money or any other
rich person's. I want what I earn. I don't want a gift with a curse on it. Let her keep her
fine things. She and her kind are responsible for all the misery of the poor on the face of
the earth."

"Seems to me you're reasonin' in a circle, Nahum," Andrew said, good-humoredly.

"Look here, Andrew, if you're on the side of the rich, why don't you say so?" cried Eva.

"He ain't," returned Fanny--"you know better, Eva Loud."

"No, I ain't," declared Andrew. "You all of you know I'm with the class I belong to; I ain't
a toady to no rich folks; I don't think no more of 'em than you do, and I don't want any favors
of 'em--all I want is pay for my honest work, and that's an even swap, and I ain't beholden,
but I want to look at things fair and square. I don't want to be carried away because I'm out
of work, though, God knows, it's hard enough."

"I don't know what's goin' to become of us," said Joseph Atkins--then he coughed.

"I don't," Jim Tenny said, bitterly.

"And God knows I don't," cried Eva, and she sat down in the nearest chair, flung up her hands
before her face, and wept.

Then Fanny spoke to Ellen, who had been sitting very still and attentive, her eyes growing
larger, her cheeks redder with excitement. Fanny had often glanced uneasily at her, and wished
to send her to bed, but she was in the habit of warming Ellen's little chamber at the head
of the stairs by leaving open the sitting-room door for a while before she went to it, and
she was afraid of cooling the room too much for Joseph Atkins, and had not ventured to interrupt
the conversation. Now, seeing the child's fevered face, she made up her mind. "Come, Ellen,
it's your bed-time," she said, and Ellen rose reluctantly, and, kissing her father, she went
to her aunt Eva, who caught at her convulsively and kissed her, and sobbed against her cheek.
"Oh, oh!" she wailed, "you precious little thing, you precious little thing, I don't know what's
goin' to become of us all."

"Don't, Eva," said Fanny, sharply; "can't you see she's all wrought up? She hadn't ought to
have heard all this talk."

Andrew looked anxiously at his wife, rose, and caught up Ellen in his arms with a hug of fervent
and protective love. "Don't you worry, father's darlin'," he whispered. "Don't you worry about
anythin' you have heard. Father will always have enough to take care of you with."

Jim Tenny, when Andrew set the child down, caught her up again with a sounding kiss. "Don't
you let your big ears ache, you little pitcher," said he, with a gay laugh. "Little doll-babies
like you haven't anythin' to worry about if Lloyd's shut down every day in the year."

"They're the very ones whom it concerns," said Nahum Beals, when Ellen and her mother had gone
up-stairs.

"Well, I wouldn't have had that little nervous thing hear all this, if I'd thought," Andrew
said, anxiously.

Joseph Atkins, whom Fanny had stationed in a sheltered corner near the stove when she opened
the door, peered around at Andrew.

"Seems as if she was too young to get much sense of it," he remarked. "My Maria, that's her
age, wouldn't."

"Ellen hears everything and makes her own sense of it," said Andrew, "and the Lord only knows
what she's made of this. I hope she won't fret over it."

"I wish my tongue had been cut off before I said anything before her," cried Eva. "I know just
what that child is. She'll find out what a hard world she's in soon enough, anyway, and I don't
want to be the one to open her eyes ahead of time."

Ellen went to bed quietly, and her mother did not think she had paid much attention to what
had been going on, and said so when she went down-stairs after Ellen had been kissed and tucked
in bed and the lamp put out. "I guess she didn't mind much about it, after all," she said to
Andrew. "I guess the room was pretty warm, and that was what made her cheeks so red."

But Ellen, after her mother left her, turned her little head towards the wall and wept softly,
lest some one hear her, but none the less bitterly that she had no right conception of the
cause of her grief. There was over her childish soul the awful shadow of the labor and poverty
of the world. She knew naught of the substance behind the shadow, but the darkness terrified
her all the more, and she cried and cried as if her heart would break. Then she, with a sudden
resolution, born she could not have told of what strange understanding and misunderstanding
of what she had heard that evening, slipped out of bed, groped about until she found her cherished
doll, sitting in her little chair in the corner. She was accustomed to take the doll to bed
with her, and had undressed her for that purpose early in the evening, but she had climbed
into bed and left her sitting in the corner.

"Don't you want your dolly?" her mother had asked.

"No, ma'am; I guess I don't want her to-night," Ellen had replied, with a little break in her
voice. Now, when she reached the doll, she gathered her up in her little arms, and groped her
way with her into the closet. She hugged the doll, and kissed her wildly, then she shook her.
"You have been naughty," she whispered--"yes, you have, dreadful naughty. No, don't you talk
to me; you have been naughty. What right had you to be livin' with rich folks, and wearin'
such fine things, when other children don't have anything. What right had that little boy that
was your mother before I was, and that rich lady that gave you to me? They had ought to be
put in the closet, too. God had ought to put them all in the closet, the way I'm goin' to put
you. Don't you say a word; you needn't cry; you've been dreadful naughty."

Ellen set the doll, face to the wall, in the corner of the closet, and left her there. Then
she crept back into bed, and lay there crying over her precious baby shivering in her thin
night-gown all alone in the dark closet. But she was firm in keeping her there, since, with
that strange, involuntary grasp of symbolism which has always been maintained by the baby-fingers
of humanity for the satisfying of needs beyond resources and the solving of problems outside
knowledge, she had a conviction that she was, in such fashion, righting wrong and punishing
evil. But she wept over the poor doll until she fell asleep.

Chapter X

When Ellen woke the next morning she had a curious feeling, as if she were blinded by the glare
of many hitherto unsuspected windows opening into the greatness outside the little world, just
large enough to contain them, in which she had dwelt all her life with her parents, her aunt,
her grandmother, and her doll. She tried to adjust herself to her old point of view with her
simple childish recognition of the most primitive facts as a basis for dreams, but she remembered
what Mr. Atkins, who coughed so dreadfully, had said the night before; she remembered what
the young man with the bulging forehead, who frightened her terribly, had said; she remembered
the gloomy look in her father's face, the misery in her aunt Eva's; and she remembered her
doll in the closet--and either everything was different or had a different light upon it. In
reality Ellen's evening in the sound and sight of that current of rebellion against the odds
of life which has taken the poor off their foot hold of understanding since the beginning of
the world had aged her. She had lost something out of her childhood. She dreaded to go down-stairs;
she had a feeling of shamefacedness struggling within her; she was afraid that her father and
mother would look at her sharply, then look again, and ask her what the matter was, and she
would not know what to say. When she went down, and backed about for her mother to fasten her
little frock as was her wont, she was careful to keep her face turned away; but Fanny caught
her up and kissed her in her usual way, and then her aunt Eva sung out to know if she wanted
to go on a sleigh-ride, and had she seen the snow; and then her father came in and that look
of last night had gone from his face, and Ellen was her old self again until she was alone
by herself and remembered.

Fanny and Andrew and Eva had agreed to say nothing before the child about the shutting-up of
Lloyd's, and their troubles in consequence. "She heard too much last night," Andrew said; "there's
no use in her botherin' her little head with it. I guess that baby won't suffer."

"She's jest the child to fret herself most to pieces thinkin' we were awful poor, and she would
starve or somethin'," Fanny said.

"Well, she sha'n't be worried if I can help it, no matter what happens to me," Eva said.

After breakfast that morning Eva went to work on a little dress of Ellen's. When Fanny told
her not to spend her time over that, when she had so much sewing of her own to do, Eva replied
with a gay, hard laugh, that she guessed she'd wait and finish her weddin'-fix when she was
goin' to be married.

"Eva Loud, you ain't goin' to be so silly as to put off your weddin'," Fanny cried out.

"I dunno as I've put it off; I dunno as I want to get married, anyhow," Eva said, still laughing.
"I dunno, but I'd rather be old maid aunt to Ellen."

"Eva Loud," cried her sister; "do you know what you are doin'?"

"Pretty well, I reckon," said Eva.

"Do you know that if you put off Jim Tenny, and he not likin' it, ten chances to one Aggie
Bemis will get hold of him again?"

"Well," said Eva, "let her. I won't have been the one to drag him into misery, anyhow."

"Well, if you can feel that way," Fanny returned, looking at her sister with a sort of mixed
admiration and pity.

"I can. I tell you what 'tis, Fanny. When I look at Jim, handsome and head up in the air, and
think how he'd look all bowed down, hair turnin' gray, and not carin' whether he's shaved and
has on a clean shirt or not, 'cause he's got loaded down with debt, and the grocery-man and
the butcher after him, and no work, and me and the children draggin' him down, I can bear anything.
If another girl wants to do it, she must, though I'd like to kill her when I think of it. I
can't do it, because--I think too much of him."

"He might lose his work after he was married, you know."

"Well, I suppose we'd have to run the risk of that; but I'm goin' to start fair or not at all."

"Well, maybe he'll get work," Fanny said.

"He won't," said Eva. She began to sing "Nancy Lee" over Ellen's dress.

After breakfast Ellen begged a piece of old brown calico of her mother. "Why, of course you
can have it, child," said her mother; "but what on earth do you want it for? I was goin' to
put it in the rag-bag."

"I want to make my dolly a dress."

"Why, that ain't fit for your dolly's dress. Only think how queer that beautiful doll would
look in a dress made of that. Why, you 'ain't thought anything but silk and satin was good
enough for her."

"I'll give you a piece of my new blue silk to make your doll a dress," said Eva.

But Ellen persisted. When the doll came out of her closet of vicarious penance she was arrayed
like a very scullion among dolls, in the remnant of the dress in which Fanny Brewster had done
her house-work all summer.

"There," Ellen told the doll, when her mother did not hear "you look more like the way you
ought to, and you ought to be happy, and not ever think you wish you had your silk dress on.
Think of all the poor children who never have any silk dresses, or any dresses at all--nothing
except their cloth bodies in the coldest weather. You ought to be thankful to have this." 
For all which good advice and philosophy the little mother of the doll would often look at
the discarded beauty of the wardrobe, with tears in her eyes and fondest pity in her heart;
but she never flinched. When the young man Nahum Beals came in, as he often did of an evening,
and raised his voice in fierce denunciation against the luxury and extravagance of the rich,
Ellen would listen and consider that he would undoubtedly approve of what she had done, did
he know, and would allow that she had made her small effort towards righting things.

"Only think what Mr. Beals would say if he saw you in your silk dress; why, I don't know but
he would throw you out of the window," she told her doll once.

Ellen did not feel any difference in her way of living after her father was out of work. "She
ain't goin' to be stented in one single thing; remember that," Andrew told Fanny, with angry
emphasis. "That little, delicate thing is goin' to have everything she needs, if I spend every
cent I've saved and mortgage the place."

"Oh, you'll get work before it comes to that," Fanny said, consolingly.

"Whether I do or not, it sha'n't make any difference," declared Andrew. "I'm goin' to hire
a horse and sleigh and take her sleigh-ridin' this afternoon. It'll be good, and she's been
talkin' about a sleigh-ride ever since snow flew."

"She could do without that," Fanny said, doubtfully.

"Well, she ain't goin' to."

So it happened that the very day after Lloyd's had shut down, when every man out of employment
felt poorer than he did later when he had grown accustomed to the sensation of no money coming
in, Andrew Brewster hired a horse and double sleigh, and took Ellen, her mother, grandmother,
and aunt out sleigh-riding. Ellen sat on the back seat of the sleigh, full of that radiant
happiness felt by a child whose pleasures have not been repeated often enough for satiety. They
are, as it were--I put it to suit my present comparison--creatures of the woods and wilds, not
in walled towns, not grouped and toned to pursue a comic exhibition of the narrower world
of society. Jaques, Falstaff and his regiment, the varied troop of Clowns, Malvolio, Sir Hugh
Evans and Fluellen--marvellous Welshmen!--Benedict and Beatrice, Dogberry, and the rest, are subjects
of a special study in the poetically comic.

His Comedy of incredible imbroglio belongs to the literary section. One may conceive that there
was a natural resemblance between him and Menander, both in the scheme and style of his lighter
plays. Had Shakespeare lived in a later and less emotional, less heroical period of our history,
he might have turned to the painting of manners as well as humanity. Euripides would probably,
in the time of Menander, when Athens was enslaved but prosperous, have lent his hand to the
composition of romantic comedy. He certainly inspired that fine genius.

Politically it is accounted a misfortune for France that her nobles thronged to the Court of
Louis Quatorze. It was a boon to the comic poet. He had that lively quicksilver world of the animalcule
passions, the huge pretensions, the placid absurdities, under his eyes in full activity; vociferous
quacks and snapping dupes, hypocrites, posturers, extravagants, pedants, rose-pink ladies and
mad grammarians, sonneteering marquises, high-flying mistresses,
plain-minded maids, inter-threading as in a loom, noisy as at a fair.

A simply bourgeois circle will not furnish it, for the middle class must have the brilliant, flippant,
independent upper for a spur and a pattern; otherwise it is likely to be inwardly dull as well
as outwardly correct.

Yet, though the King was benevolent toward Moliere, it is not to
the French Court that we are indebted for his unrivalled studies of
mankind in society.

For the amusement of the Court the ballets and farces were written, which are dearer to the
rabble upper, as to the rabble lower, class than intellectual comedy.

The French bourgeoisie of Paris were sufficiently quick-witted and enlightened by education
to welcome great works like Le Tartuffe, Les Femmes Savantes, and Le Misanthrope, works that
were perilous ventures on the popular intelligence, big vessels to launch on streams running
to shallows. The Tartuffe hove into view as an enemy's vessel; it offended, not Dieu mais les
devots, as the Prince de Conde explained the cabal raised against it to the King.

The Femmes Savantes is a capital instance of the uses of comedy in
teaching the world to understand what ails it.

The farce of the Precieuses ridiculed and put a stop to the monstrous romantic jargon made popular
by certain famous novels.

The comedy of the Femmes Savantes exposed the later and less apparent but more finely comic absurdity
of an excessive purism in grammar and diction, and the tendency to
be idiotic in precision.

The French had felt the burden of this new nonsense; but they had
to see the comedy several times before they were consoled in their
suffering by seeing the cause of it exposed.

The Misanthrope was yet more frigidly received. Moliere thought it dead. 'I cannot improve
on it, and assuredly never shall,' he said. It is one of the French titles to honour that this
quintessential comedy of the opposition of Alceste and Celimene was ultimately understood
and applauded. In all countries the middle class presents the public which, fighting the world,
and with a good footing in the fight, knows the world best. It may be the most selfish, but that
is a question leading us into sophistries. Cultivated men and women, who do not skim the cream
of life, and are attached to the duties, yet escape the harsher blows, make acute and balanced observers.
Moliere is their poet.

Of this class in England, a large body, neither Puritan nor Bacchanalian, have a sentimental objection
to face the study of the actual world. They take up disdain of it, when its truths appear humiliating:
when the facts are not immediately forced on them, they take up the pride of incredulity.
They live in a hazy atmosphere that they suppose an ideal one. Humorous writing they will endure,
perhaps approve, if it mingles with pathos to shake and elevate the
feelings.

They approve of Satire, because, like the beak of the vulture, it smells of carrion, which they
are not. But of Comedy they have a shivering dread, for Comedy enfolds them with the wretched
host of the world, huddles them with us all in an ignoble assimilation,
and cannot be used by any exalted variety as a scourge and a broom.

Nay, to be an exalted variety is to come under the calm curious eye of the Comic spirit, and be
probed for what you are.

Men are seen among them, and very many cultivated women.

You may distinguish them by a favourite phrase: 'Surely we are not
so bad!' and the remark: 'If that is human nature, save us from it!'
as if it could be done: but in the peculiar Paradise of the wilful
people who will not see, the exclamation assumes the saving grace.

Yet should you ask them whether they dislike sound sense, they vow they do not. And question
cultivated women whether it pleases them to be shown moving on an intellectual level with men,
they will answer that it does; numbers of them claim the situation. Now, Comedy is the fountain
of sound sense; not the less perfectly sound on account of the sparkle:
and Comedy lifts women to a station offering them free play for their
wit, as they usually show it, when they have it, on the side of sound
sense.

The higher the Comedy, the more prominent the part they enjoy in it.

Dorine in the Tartuffe is common-sense incarnate, though palpably a waiting-maid. Celimene is
undisputed mistress of the same attribute in the Misanthrope; wiser
as a woman than Alceste as man.

In Congreve's Way of the World, Millamant overshadows Mirabel, the sprightliest male figure
of English comedy.

But those two ravishing women, so copious and so choice of speech,
who fence with men and pass their guard, are heartless!

Is it not preferable to be the pretty idiot, the passive beauty,
the adorable bundle of caprices, very feminine, very sympathetic,
of romantic and sentimental fiction?

Our women are taught to think so. The Agnes of the Ecole des Femmes should be a lesson for men.
The heroines of Comedy are like women of the world, not necessarily heartless from being clear-sighted:
they seem so to the sentimentally-reared only for the reason that
they use their wits, and are not wandering vessels crying for a captain
or a pilot.

Comedy is an exhibition of their battle with men, and that of men with them: and as the two,
however divergent, both look on one object, namely, Life, the gradual
similarity of their impressions must bring them to some resemblance.

The Comic poet dares to show us men and women coming to this mutual likeness; he is for saying
that when they draw together in social life their minds grow liker; just as the philosopher
discerns the similarity of boy and girl, until the girl is marched away to the nursery. Philosopher
and Comic poet are of a cousinship in the eye they cast on life: and they are equally unpopular with
our wilful English of the hazy region and the ideal that is not to
be disturbed.

Thus, for want of instruction in the Comic idea, we lose a large audience among our cultivated middle
class that we should expect to support Comedy.

The sentimentalist is as averse as the Puritan and as the Bacchanalian.

Our traditions are unfortunate. The public taste is with the idle laughers, and still inclines
to follow them. It may be shown by an analysis of Wycherley's Plain Dealer, a coarse prose
adaption of the Misanthrope, stuffed with lumps of realism in a vulgarized theme to hit the
mark of English appetite, that we have in it the keynote of the Comedy of our stage. It is Moliere
travestied, with the hoof to his foot and hair on the pointed tip of his ear. And how difficult
it is for writers to disentangle themselves from bad traditions is
noticeable when we find Goldsmith, who had grave command of the Comic
in narrative, producing an elegant farce for a Comedy; and Fielding,
who was a master of the Comic both in narrative and in dialogue, not
even approaching to the presentable in farce.

These bad traditions of Comedy affect us not only on the stage, but
in our literature, and may be tracked into our social life.

They are the ground of the heavy moralizings by which we are outwearied, about Life as a Comedy,
and Comedy as a jade, {4} when popular writers, conscious of fatigue in creativeness, desire to
be cogent in a modish cynicism: perversions of the idea of life, and of the proper esteem for
the society we have wrested from brutishness, and would carry higher. Stock images of this description
are accepted by the timid and the sensitive, as well as by the saturnine, quite seriously; for
not many look abroad with their own eyes, fewer still have the habit of thinking for themselves.
Life, we know too well, is not a Comedy, but something strangely mixed; nor is Comedy a vile
mask.

The corrupted importation from France was noxious; a noble entertainment spoilt to suit the
wretched taste of a villanous age; and the later imitations of it, partly drained of its poison and
made decorous, became tiresome, notwithstanding their fun, in the perpetual recurring of the same
situations, owing to the absence of original study and vigour of conception. Scene v. Act 2
of the Misanthrope, owing, no doubt, to the fact of our not producing matter for original study,
is repeated in succession by Wycherley, Congreve, and Sheridan, and as it is at second hand,
we have it done cynically--or such is the tone; in the manner of 'below stairs.' Comedy thus
treated may be accepted as a version of the ordinary worldly understanding of our social life;
at least, in accord with the current dicta concerning it. The epigrams can be made; but it is
uninstructive, rather tending to do disservice. Comedy justly treated, as you find it in Moliere,
whom we so clownishly mishandled, the Comedy of Moliere throws no infamous reflection upon life.
It is deeply conceived, in the first place, and therefore it cannot be impure. Meditate on
that statement. Never did man wield so shrieking a scourge upon vice, but his consummate self-mastery
is not shaken while administering it. Tartuffe and Harpagon, in fact, are made each to whip
himself and his class, the false pietists, and the insanely covetous.

Moliere has only set them in motion. He strips Folly to the skin, displays the imposture of the creature,
and is content to offer her better clothing, with the lesson Chrysale reads to Philaminte and
Belise. He conceives purely, and he writes purely, in the simplest language, the simplest of
French verse.

The source of his wit is clear reason: it is a fountain of that soil; and it springs to vindicate
reason, common-sense, rightness and justice; for no vain purpose
ever.

The wit is of such pervading spirit that it inspires a pun with meaning and interest. {5} His
moral does not hang like a tail, or preach from one character incessantly
cocking an eye at the audience, as in recent realistic French Plays:
but is in the heart of his work, throbbing with every pulsation of
an organic structure.

If Life is likened to the comedy of Moliere, there is no scandal in the comparison.

Congreve's Way of the World is an exception to our other comedies,
his own among them, by virtue of the remarkable brilliancy of the
writing, and the figure of Millamant.

The comedy has no idea in it, beyond the stale one, that so the world goes; and it concludes
with the jaded discovery of a document at a convenient season for the descent of the curtain.
A plot was an afterthought with Congreve. By the help of a wooden villain (Maskwell) marked
Gallows to the flattest eye, he gets a sort of plot in The Double
Dealer.

{6} His Way of the World might be called The Conquest of a Town Coquette, and Millamant is a perfect
portrait of a coquette, both in her resistance to Mirabel and the
manner of her surrender, and also in her tongue.

The wit here is not so salient as in certain passages of Love for Love, where Valentine feigns
madness or retorts on his father, or Mrs. Frail rejoices in the harmlessness of wounds to a woman's
virtue, if she 'keeps them from air.' In The Way of the World, it appears less prepared in
the smartness, and is more diffused in the more characteristic style of the speakers. Here, however,
as elsewhere, his famous wit is like a bully-fencer, not ashamed
to lay traps for its exhibition, transparently petulant for the train
between certain ordinary words and the powder-magazine of the improprieties
to be fired.

Contrast the wit of Congreve with Moliere's. That of the first is a Toledo blade, sharp, and wonderfully
supple for steel; cast for duelling, restless in the scabbard, being
so pretty when out of it.

To shine, it must have an adversary. Moliere's wit is like a running brook, with innumerable
fresh lights on it at every turn of the wood through which its business is to find a way. It
does not run in search of obstructions, to be noisy over them; but when dead leaves and viler
substances are heaped along the course, its natural song is heightened. Without effort, and with no dazzling
flashes of achievement, it is full of healing, the wit of good breeding, the wit of wisdom.

'Genuine
humour and true wit,' says Landor, {7} 'require a sound and capacious mind, which is always
a grave one. Rabelais and La Fontaine are recorded by their countrymen to have been reveurs.
Few men have been graver than Pascal. Few men have been wittier.'

To apply the citation of so great a brain as Pascal's to our countryman would be unfair. Congreve
had a certain soundness of mind; of capacity, in the sense intended
by Landor, he had little.

Judging him by his wit, he performed some happy thrusts, and taking it for genuine, it is a surface
wit, neither rising from a depth nor flowing from a spring.

'On voit qu'il se travaille a dire de bons mots.'

He drives the poor hack word, 'fool,' as cruelly to the market for wit as any of his competitors.
Here is an example, that has been held up for eulogy:

WITWOUD: He has brought me a letter from the fool my brother, etc. etc.

MIRABEL: A fool, and your brother, Witwoud?

WITWOUD: Ay, ay, my half-brother. My half-brother he is; no nearer, upon my honour.

MIRABEL: Then 'tis possible he may be but half a fool.

By evident preparation. This is a sort of wit one remembers to have heard at school, of a brilliant
outsider; perhaps to have been guilty of oneself, a trifle later.

It was, no doubt, a blaze of intellectual fireworks to the bumpkin squire, who came to London
to go to the theatre and learn manners. He had correct judgement, a correct ear, readiness of illustration
within a narrow range, in snapshots of the obvious at the obvious, and copious language. He hits
the mean of a fine style and a natural in dialogue. The Way of the World may be read out currently
at a first glance, so sure are the accents of the emphatic meaning to strike the eye, perforce
of the crispness and cunning polish of the sentences.

You have not to look over them before you confide yourself to him; he will carry you safe.
Sheridan imitated, but was far from surpassing him. The flow of boudoir Billingsgate in Lady
Wishfort is unmatched for the vigour and pointedness of the tongue. It spins along with a final
ring, like the voice of Nature in a fury, and is, indeed, racy eloquence
of the elevated fishwife.

Millamant is an admirable, almost a lovable heroine. It is a piece of genius in a writer to make
a woman's manner of speech portray her. You feel sensible of her presence in every line of her
speaking.

The stipulations with her lover in view of marriage, her fine lady's
delicacy, and fine lady's easy evasions of indelicacy, coquettish
airs, and playing with irresolution, which in a common maid would
be bashfulness, until she submits to 'dwindle into a wife,' as she
says, form a picture that lives in the frame, and is in harmony with
Mirabel's description of her:

'Here she comes, i' faith, full sail,
with her fan spread, and her streamers out, and a shoal of fools for
tenders.'

And, after an interview:

'Think of you!

To think of a whirlwind, though 'twere in a whirlwind, were a case of more steady contemplation,
a very tranquillity of mind and mansion.'

There is a picturesqueness, as of Millamant and no other, in her voice, when she is encouraged to take
Mirabel by Mrs. Fainall, who is 'sure she has a mind to him':

MILLAMANT: Are you? I think I have--and the horrid man looks as if he thought so too, etc. etc.

One
hears the tones, and sees the sketch and colour of the whole scene in reading it.

Celimene is behind Millamant in vividness. An air of bewitching whimsicality hovers over the
graces of this Comic heroine, like the lively conversational play of a beautiful mouth.

But in wit she is no rival of Celimene. What she utters adds to her personal witchery, and is
not further memorable. She is a flashing portrait, and a type of the superior ladies who do
not think, not of those who do. In representing a class, therefore, it is a lower class, in the
proportion that one of Gainsborough's full-length aristocratic women is below the permanent
impressiveness of a fair Venetian head.

Millamant side by side with Celimene is an example of how far the realistic painting of a character
can be carried to win our favour; and of where it falls short. Celimene is a woman's mind in
movement, armed with an ungovernable wit; with perspicacious clear eyes for the world, and a
very distinct knowledge that she belongs to the world, and is most at home in it. She is attracted
to Alceste by her esteem for his honesty; she cannot avoid seeing where the good sense of the man
is diseased.

Rousseau, in his letter to D'Alembert on the subject of the Misanthrope, discusses the character
of Alceste, as though Moliere had put him forth for an absolute example
of misanthropy; whereas Alceste is only a misanthrope of the circle
he finds himself placed in: he has a touching faith in the virtue
residing in the country, and a critical love of sweet simpleness.

Nor is he the principal person of the comedy to which he gives a name. He is only passively
comic. Celimene is the active spirit.

While he is denouncing and railing, the trial is imposed upon her to make the best of him, and
control herself, as much as a witty woman, eagerly courted, can do

.
 "That little thing ain't goin' to be cheated
nohow," he said one night after Ellen had gone to bed and his visiting companions of the cutting-room
had happened in.

"I know my children won't get much," Joseph Atkins said, coughing as he spoke; "they wouldn't
if Lloyd's hadn't shut down. I never see the time when I could afford to make any account of
Christmas, much as ever I could manage a turkey Thanksgiving day."

"The poor that the Lord died for can't afford to keep his birthday; it is the rich that he's
going to cast into outer darkness, that keep it for their own ends, and it's a blasphemy and
a mockery," proclaimed Nahum Beals. He was very excited that night, and would often spring
to his feet and stride across the room. There was another man there that night, a cousin of
Joseph Atkins, John Sargent by name. He had recently moved to Rowe, since he had obtained work
at McGuire's, "had accepted a position in the finishing-room of Mr. H. S. McGuire's factory
in the city of Rowe," as the item in the local paper put it. He was a young man, younger than
his cousin, but he looked older. He had a handsome face, under the most complete control as
to its muscles. When he laughed he gave the impression of the fixedness of merriment of a mask.
He looked keenly at Nahum Beals with that immovable laugh on his face, and spoke with perfectly
good-natured sarcasm. "All very well for the string-pieces of the bridge from oppression to
freedom," he said, "but you need some common-sense for the ties, or you'll slump."

"What do you mean?"

"We ain't in the Old Testament, but the nineteenth century, and those old prophets, if they
were alive to-day, would have to step down out of their flaming chariots and hang their mantles
on the bushes, and instead of standing on mountain-tops and tellin' their enemies what rats
they were, and how they would get what they deserved later on, they would have to tell their
enemies what they wanted them to do to better matters, and make them do it."

"Instead of standing by your own strike in Greenboro, you quit and come here to work in McGuire's
the minute you got a chance," said Nahum Beals, sullenly, and Sargent responded, with his unrelaxing
laugh, "I left enough strikers for the situation in Greenboro; don't you worry about me."

"I think he done quite right to quit the strike if he got a chance to work," Joseph Atkins
interposed. "Folks have got to look out for themselves, labor reform or no labor reform."

"That's the corner-stone of labor reform, seems to me," said Andrew.

"Seems to me sometimes you talk like a damned scab," cried Nahum Beals, fiercely, red spots
flickering in his thin cheeks. Andrew looked at him, and spoke with slow wrath. "Look here,
Nahum Beals," he said, "you're in my house, but I ain't goin' to stand no such talk as that,
I can tell you."

John Sargent laid a pacifically detaining hand on Nahum Beals's arm as he strode past him.
"Oh, Lord, stop rampagin' up and down like a wildcat," he said. "What good do you think you're
doin' tearin' and shoutin' and insultin' people? He ain't talkin' like a scab, he's only talkin'
a tie to your string-piece."

"That's so," said Joseph Atkins. Sargent boarded with him, and the board money was a godsend
to him, now he was out of work. John Sargent had fixed his own price, and it was an unheard-of
one for such simple fare as he had. His weekly dollars kept the whole poor family in food.
But John Sargent was a bachelor, and earning remarkably good wages, and Joseph Atkins's ailing
wife, whom illness and privation had made unnaturally grasping and ungrateful, told her cronies
that it wasn't as if he couldn't afford it.

Up-stairs little Ellen lay in her bed, her doll in her arms, listening to the low rumble of
masculine voices in the room below. Her mother had gone out, and there were only the men there.
They were smoking, and the odor of their pipes floated up into Ellen's chamber through the
door-cracks. She thought how her grandmother Brewster would sniff when she came in next day.
She could hear her saying, "Well, for my part, if those men couldn't smoke their old pipes
somewhere else besides in my sittin'-room, I wouldn't have 'em in the house."  But that reflection
did not trouble Ellen very long, and she had never been disturbed herself by the odor of the
pipes. She thought of them insensibly as the usual atmosphere when men were gathered together
in any place except the church. She knew that they were talking about that old trouble, and
Nahum Beals's voice of high wrath made her shrink; but, after all, she was removed from it
all that night into a little prospective paradise of her own, which, as is the case in childhood,
seemed to overgild her own future and all the troubles of the world. Christmas was only a week
distant, she was to have a tree, and the very next evening her mother had promised to take
her down-town and show her the beautiful, lighted Christmas shops. She wondered, listening
to that rumble of discontent below, why grown-up men and women ever fretted when they were
at liberty to go down-town every evening when they chose and look at the lighted shops, for
she could still picture pure delight for others without envy or bitterness.

The next day the child was radiant; she danced rather than walked; she could not speak without
a smile; she could eat nothing, for her happiness was so purely spiritual that desires of the
flesh were in abeyance. Her heart beat fast; the constantly recurring memory of what was about
to happen fairly overwhelmed her as with waves of delight.

"If you don't eat your supper you can't go, and that's all there is about it," her mother told
her when they were seated at the table, and Ellen sat dreaming before her toast and peach preserve.

"You must eat your supper, Ellen," Andrew said, anxiously. Andrew had on his other coat, and
he had shaved, and was going too, as was Mrs. Zelotes Brewster.

"She 'ain't eat a thing all day, she's so excited about goin'," Fanny said. "Now, Ellen, you
must eat your supper, or you can't go--you'll be sick."

And Ellen ate her supper, though exceeding joy as well as exceeding woe can make food lose
its savor, and toast and preserves were as ashes on her tongue when the very fragrance of coming
happiness was in her soul.

When, finally, in hand of her mother, while Andrew walked behind with her grandmother, she
went towards the lights of the town, she had a feeling as of wings on her feet. However, she
walked soberly enough with wide eyes of amazement and delight at everything--the long, silver
track of the snowy road under the light of the full moon, the slants of the house roofs sparkling
with crusts of crystals, the lighted windows set with house plants, for the dwellers in the
outskirts of Rowe loved house plants, and their front windows bloomed with the emulative splendor
of geraniums from fall to spring. She saw behind them glimpses of lives and some doings as
real as her own, but mysterious under the locks of other personalities, and therefore as full
of possibilities of preciousness as the sheet of morning dew over a neighbor's yard; she had
often believed she saw diamonds sparkle in that, though never in her own. She had proved it
otherwise too often. So Ellen, seeing through a window a little girl of her own age in a red
frock, straightway believed it to be satin of the richest quality, and, seeing through another
window a tea-table spread, had no doubt that the tin teapot was silver. A girl with a crown
of yellow braids pulled down a curtain, and she thought her as beautiful as an angel; but of
all this she said nothing at all, only walked soberly on, holding fast to her mother's hand.

When they were half-way to the shops, a door of a white house close to the road flew open and
shut again with a bang, there was a scurry and grating slide on the front walk, then the gate
was thrown back, and a boy dashed through with a wild whoop, just escaping contact with Mrs.
Zelotes Brewster. "You'd better be careful," said she, sharply. "It ain't the thing for boys
to come tearin' out of yards in the evenin' without seein' where they are goin'."

The boy cast an abashed glance at her. The street-lamp shone full on his face, which was round
and reddened by the frosty winds, with an aimlessly grinning mouth of uncertain youth, and
black eyes with a bold and cheerful outlook on the unknown. He was only ten, but he was large
for his age. Ellen, when he looked from her grandmother back at her, thought him almost a man,
and then she saw that he was the boy who had brought the chestnuts to her the night when she
had returned from her runaway excursion. The boy recognized her at the same moment, and his
mouth seemed to gape wider, and a moist red overspread his face down to his swathing woollen
scarf. Then he gave another whoop significant of the extreme of nervous abashedness and the
incipient defiance of his masculine estate, there was a flourish of heels, followed by a swift
glimmering slide of steel, and he was off trailing his sled.

"That's that Joy boy that brought Ellen the chestnuts that time," Fanny said. "Do you remember
him, Ellen?"

"Yes, ma'am," replied Ellen. The look of the boy in her face had bewildered and confused her,
without her knowing the why of it. It was as if she had spelled a word in her reading-book
whose meaning she could not grasp.

"I don't care who he is," said Mrs. Zelotes, "he 'ain't no business racin' out of gates that
way, and his folks hadn't ought to let a boy no older than that out alone of nights."

They kept on, and the boy apparently left them far behind in his career of youthful exuberance,
until they came to the factories. Andrew looked up at the windows of Lloyd's, dark except for
a faint glimmer in a basement window from the lamp of the solitary watchman, and drew a heavy sigh.

"It ain't as bad for you as it is for some," his mother said, sharply, and then she jumped
aside, catching her son's arm as the boy sprang out of a covering shadow under the wall of
Lloyd's and dashed before them with another wild whoop and another glance of defiant bashfulness
at Ellen.

"My land! it's that boy again," cried Mrs. Zelotes. "Here, you boy!--boy! What's your name?"

"His name is Granville Joy," Ellen replied, unexpectedly.

"Why, how did you know, child?" her grandmother asked. "Seems to me he's got a highfalutin'
name enough. Here you, Granville--if that's your name--don't you know any better than to--"
But the boy was gone, his sled creaking on the hard snow at his heels, and a faint whoop sounded
from the distance.

"I guess if I had the bringin' up of that boy there wouldn't be such doin's," said Mrs. Zelotes,
severely. "His mother's a pretty woman, but I don't believe she's got much force. She wouldn't
have given him such a name if she had."

"She named him after the town she came from," said Fanny. "She told me once. She's a real smart
woman, and she makes that boy stand around."

"She must; it looks as if he was standin' round pretty lively jest now," said Mrs. Zelotes.
"Namin' of a boy after a town! They'd better wait and name a town after the boy if he amounts
to anything."

"His mother told me he was goin' into the first grammar-school next year," said Fanny.

"I pity the teacher," said Mrs. Zelotes, and then she recoiled, for the boy made another dart
from behind a lamp-post, crossed their path, and was off again.

"My land!" gasped Mrs. Zelotes, "you speak to him, Andrew."  But Andrew laughed. "Might as
well speak to a whirlwind," said he. "He ain't doin' any harm, mother; it's only his boyish
antics. For Heaven's sake, let him enjoy himself while he can, it won't be long before the
grind-mill in there will get hold of him, and then he'll be sober enough to suit anybody,"
and Andrew pointed at Lloyd's as he spoke.

"Boys can be boys," said Mrs. Zelotes, severely, "and they can have a good time, but they can
behave themselves."

None of them looking after that flying and whooping figure ahead had the slightest idea of
the true situation. They did not know that the boy was confused by the fires, none the less
ardent that they were so innocent, of a first love for Ellen; that, ever since he had seen
her little, fair face on her aunt's shoulder the day when she was found, it had been even closer
to his heart than his sled and his jackstones and his ball, and his hope of pudding for dinner.
They did not know that he had toiled at the wood-pile of a Saturday, and run errands after
school, to earn money to buy Christmas presents for his mother and Ellen; that he had at that
very minute in his purse in the bottom of his pocket the sum of eighty-nine cents, mostly in
coppers, since his wage was generally payable in that coin, and his pocket sagged arduously
therefrom. They did not know that he was even then bound upon an errand to the grocery store
for a bag of flour to be brought home on his sled, and would thereby swell his exchequer by
another cent. They did not know what dawning chords of love, and knowledge of love, that wild
whoop expressed; and the boy dodged and darted and hid, and appeared before them all the way
to the busy main street of Rowe; and, after they had entered the great store where the finest
Christmas display was held, he stood before the window staring at Ellen vanishing in a brilliant
vista, and whooped now and then, regardless of public opinion.

Ellen, when once she was inside the store, forgot everything else. She clung more tightly to
her mother's hand, as one will cling to any wonted stay of love in the midst of strangeness,
even of joy, and she saw everything with eyes which photographed it upon her very soul. At
first she had an impression of a dazzling incoherence of splendor, of a blare as of thousands
of musical instruments all sounding different notes of delight, of a weaving pattern of colors,
too intricate to master, of a mingled odor of paint and varnish, and pine and hemlock boughs,
and then she spelled out the letters of the details. She looked at those counters set with
the miniature paraphernalia of household life which give the first sweet taste of domesticity
and housekeeping joys to a little girl.

There were the sets of dolls' furniture, and the dolls, dishes, and there was a counter with
dolls' cooking-stoves and ranges bristling with the most delightful realism of pots and pans,
at which she gazed so fixedly and breathlessly that she looked almost stupid. Her elders watched
half in delight, half with pain, that they could not purchase everything at which she looked.
Mrs. Zelotes bought some things surreptitiously, hiding the parcels under her shawl. Andrew,
whispering to a salesman, asked the price of a great cooking-stove at which Ellen looked long.
When he heard the amount he sighed. Fanny touched his arm comfortingly. "There would be no
sense in your buying that, if you had all the money in creation," she said, in a hushed voice.
"There's a twenty-five-cent one that's good enough. I'm going to buy that for her to-morrow.
She'll never know the difference."  But Andrew Brewster, nevertheless, went through the great,
dazzling shop with his heart full of bitterness. It seemed to him monstrous and incredible
that he had a child as beautiful and altogether wonderful as that, and could not buy the whole
stock for her if she wanted it. He had never in his whole life wanted anything for himself
that he could not have, enough to give him pain, but he wanted for his child with a longing
that was a passion. Her little desires seemed to him the most important and sacred needs in
the whole world. He watched her with pity and admiration, and shame at his own impotence of
love to give her all.

But Ellen knew nothing of it. She was radiant. She never thought of wanting all those treasures
further than she already had them. She gazed at the wonders in that department where the toy
animals were kept, and which resembled a miniature menagerie, the silence broken by the mooing
of cows, the braying of donkeys, the whistle of canaries, and the roars of mock-lions when
their powers were invoked by the attendants, and her ears drank in that discordant bable of
tiny mimicry like music. There was no spirit of criticism in her. She was utterly pleased with
everything.

When her grandmother held up a toy-horse and said the fore-legs were too long, Ellen wondered
what she meant. To her mind it was more like a horse than any real one she had ever seen.

As she gazed at the decorations, the wreaths, the gauze, the tinsel, and paper angels, suspended
by invisible wires over the counters, and all glittering and shining and twinkling with light,
a strong whiff of evergreen fragrance came to her, and the aroma of fir-balsam, and it was
to her the very breath of all the mysterious joy and hitherto untasted festivity of this earth
into which she had come. She felt deep in her childish soul the sense of a promise of happiness
in the future, of which this was a foretaste. When she went into the department where the dolls
dwelt, she fairly turned pale. They swung, and sat, and lay, and stood, as in angelic ranks,
all smiling between shining fluffs of hair. It was a chorus of smiles, and made the child's
heart fairly leap. She felt as if all the dolls were smiling at her. She clung fast to her
mother's hand, and hid her face against her skirt.

"Why, what is the matter, Ellen?" Fanny asked. Ellen looked up, and smiled timidly and confusedly,
then at the dazzle of waxen faces and golden locks above skirts of delicate pink and blue and
white, like flower petals.

"You never saw so many dolls together before, did you, Ellen?" said Andrew; then he added,
wistfully, "There ain't one of 'em any bigger and prettier than your own doll, be they, Ellen?"
And that, although he had never recovered from his uneasiness about that mysterious doll.

Ellen had not seen Cynthia Lennox since that morning several weeks ago when she had run away
from her, except one glimpse when she was sleigh-riding. Now all at once, when they had stopped
to look at some wonderful doll-houses, she saw her face to face. Ellen had been gazing with
rapture at a great doll-house completely furnished, and Andrew had made one of his miserable
side inquiries as to its price, and Fanny had said, quite loud, "Lord, Andrew, you might just
as well ask the price of the store! You know such a thing as that is out of the question for
any child unless her father is rich as Norman Lloyd," and Ellen, who had not noticed what they
were saying, looked up, when a faint breath of violets smote her sense with a quick memory,
and there was the strange lady who had taken her into her house and kept her and given her
the doll, the strange lady whom the gentleman said might be punished for keeping her if people
were to know.

Cynthia Lennox went pale when, without knowing what was going to happen, she looked down and
saw suddenly the child's innocent face looking into hers. She stood wavering in her trailing,
fur-lined, and softly whispering draperies, so marked and set aside by her grace and elegance
and countenance of superiority and proud calm that people turned to look after her more than
after many a young beauty, and did not, for a second, know what to say or do. She had no mind
to shrink from a recognition of the child; she had no fear of the result, but there was a distinct
shrinking at a scene with that flashing-eyed and heavy-browed mother of the child in such a
place as that. She would undoubtedly speak very loud. She expected the volley of recrimination
in a high treble which would follow the announcement in that sweet little flute which she remembered
so well.

"Mamma, that is the lady who kept me, and would not let me go home."

But Ellen, after a second's innocent and startled regard, turned away with no more recognition
than if she had been a stranger. She turned her little back to her, and looked at the doll-house.
A great flush flamed over Cynthia Lennox's face, and a qualm of mortal shame. She took an impetuous
glide forward, and was just about to speak and tell the truth, whatever the consequences, and
not be outdone in magnanimity by that child, when a young girl with a sickly but impudent and
pretty face jostled her rudely. The utter pertness of her ignorant youth knew no respect for
even the rich Miss Cynthia Lennox. "Here's your parcel, lady," she said, in her rough young
voice, its shrillness modified by hoarseness from too much shouting for cash boys during this
busy season, and she thrust, with her absent eyes upon a gentleman coming towards her, a parcel
into Cynthia's hands. Somehow the touch of that parcel seemed to bring Cynthia to her senses.
It was a kodak which she had been purchasing for the little boy who had lived with her, and
whom it had almost broken her heart to lose. She remembered what her friend Lyman Risley had
said, that it might make trouble for others besides herself. She took her parcel with that
involuntary meekness which the proudest learn before the matchless audacity of youthful ignorance
when it fairly asserts itself, and passed out of the store to her waiting carriage. Ellen saw her.

"That was Cynthia Lennox, wasn't it?" Fanny said, with something like awe. "Wasn't that an
elegant cloak she had on? I guess it was Russian sable."

"I don't care if it was, it ain't a mite handsomer than my cape lined with squirrel," said
Mrs. Zelotes.

Ellen looked intently at a game on the counter. It was ten o'clock when Ellen went home. She
had been into all the principal stores which were decorated for Christmas. Her brain resembled
a kaleidoscope as she hurried along at her mother's hand. Every thought seemed to whirl the
disk, and new and more dazzling combinations appeared, but the principle which underlay the
whole was that of the mystery of festivity and joy upon the face of the earth, of which this
Christmas wealth was the key.

The Brewsters had scarcely reached the factory neighborhood when there was a swift bound ahead
of them and the familiar whoop.

"There's that boy again," said Mrs. Zelotes.

She made various remonstrances, and even Andrew, when the boy had passed his own home in his
persistent dogging of them, called out to him, as did Fanny, but he was too far ahead to hear.
The boy followed them quite to their gate, proceeding with wild spurts and dashes from shadow
to shadow, and at last reappeared from behind one of the evergreen trees in the west yard,
springing out of its long shadow with strange effect. He darted close to Ellen as she passed
in the gate, crammed something into her hand, and was gone. Andrew could not catch him, though
he ran after him. "He ran like a rabbit," he said, coming breathlessly into the house, where
they were looking at the treasure the boy had thrust upon Ellen. It was a marvel of a patent
top, which the boy had long desired to own. He had spent all his money on it, and his mother
was cheated of her Christmas present, but he had given, and Ellen had received, her first token
of love.

Chapter XII

The next spring Ellen went to school. When a child who has reigned in undisputed sovereignty
at home is thrust among other children at school, one of two things happens: either she is
scorned and rebelled against, and her little crown of superiority rolled in the dust of the
common playground, or she extends the territories of her empire. Ellen extended hers, though
involuntarily, for there was no conscious thirst for power in her.

On her first morning at school, she seated herself at her desk and looked forth from the golden
cloud of her curls, her eyes full of innocent contemplation, her mouth corners gravely drooping.
She knew one little girl who sat not far from her. The little girl's name was Floretta Vining.
Floretta was built on the scale of a fairy, with tiny, fine, waxen features, a little tossing
mane of flaxen hair, eyes a most lovely and perfect blue, with no more depth in them than in
the blue of china, and an expression of the sweetest and most innocent inanity and irresponsibility.
Nobody ever expected anything of this little Floretta Vining. She was always a negative success.
She smiled around from the foot of her curving class, and never had her lessons, but she never
disobeyed the rules, except that of punctuality.

Floretta was late at school. She came daintily up the aisle, two cheap bangles on one wrist
slipping over a slim hand, and tinkling. Floretta's mother had a taste for the cheaply decorative.
There was an abundance of coarse lace on Floretta's frock, and she wore a superfluous sash
which was not too fresh. Floretta toed out excessively, her slender little feet pointing out
sharply, almost at right angles with each other, and Ellen admired her for that. She watched
her coming, planting each foot as carefully and precisely as a bird, her lace frills flouncing
up and down, her bangles jingling, and thought how very pretty she was.

Ellen felt herself very loving towards the teacher and Floretta Vining. Floretta leaned forward
as soon as she was seated and gazed at her with astonishment, and that deepening of amiability
and general sweetness which one can imagine in the face of a doll after persistent scrutiny.
Ellen smiled decorously, for she was not sure how much smiling was permissible in school. When
she smiled guardedly at Floretta, she was conscious of another face regarding her, twisted
slightly over a shabby little shoulder covered with an ignominious blue stuff, spotted and
faded. This little girl's wisp of brown braid was tied with a shoe-string, and she looked poorer
than any other child in the school, but she had an honest light in her eyes, and Ellen considered
her to be rather more beautiful than Floretta.

She was Maria Atkins, Joseph Atkins's second child. Ellen sat with her book before her, and
the strange, new atmosphere of the school-room stole over her senses. It was not altogether
pleasant, although it was considered that the ventilation was after the most approved modern
system. She perceived a strong odor of peppermints, and Floretta Vining was waving ostentatiously
a coarse little pocket-handkerchief scented with New-mown Hay. There was also a strong effusion
of stale dinners and storm-beaten woollen garments, but there was, after all, that savor of
festivity which Ellen was apt to discover in the new. She looked over her book with utter content.
In a line with her, on the boys' side, there appeared a covertly peeping face under a thatch
of light hair, and Ellen, influenced insensibly by the boy's shyly worshipful eyes, looked
and saw Granville Joy. She remembered the Christmas top, and blushed very pink without knowing
why, and flirted all her curls towards the boys' side.

Ellen, from having so little acquaintance with boys, had had no very well-defined sentiments
towards them, but now, on being set apart with her feminine element, and separated so definitely
by the middle aisle of the school-room, she began to experience sensations both of shyness
and exclusiveness. She did not think the boys, in their coarse clothes, with their cropped
heads, half as pretty as the girls.

The teacher coming down the aisle laid a caressing hand on Ellen's curls, and the child looked
up at her with that confidence which is exquisite flattery.

After she had passed, Ellen heard a subtle whisper somewhere at her back; it was half audible,
but its meaning was entirely plain. It signified utmost scorn and satirical contempt. It was
fine-pointed and far-reaching. A number looked around. It was as expressive as a whole sentence,
and, being as concentrated, was fairly explosive with meaning.

"H'm, ain't you pretty? Ain't you dreadful pretty, little dolly-pinky-rosy. H'm, teacher's
partial. Ain't you pretty? Ain't you stuck up? H'm."

Ellen, not being used to the school vernacular, did not fairly apprehend all this, and least
of all that it was directed towards herself. She cast a startled look around, then turned to
her book. She leaned back in her seat and held her book before her face with both hands, and
began to read, spelling out the words noiselessly. All at once, she felt a fine prick on her
head, and threw back one hand and turned quickly. The little girl behind was engrossed in study,
and all Ellen could see was the parting in her thick black hair, for her head was supported
by her two hands, her elbows were resting on her desk, and she was whispering the boundaries
of the State of Massachusetts.

Ellen turned back to her reading-book, and recommenced studying with the painful faithfulness
of the new student; then came again that small, fine, exasperating prick, and she thrust her
face around quickly to see that same faithfully intent little girl.

Ellen rubbed her head doubtfully, and tried to fix her attention again upon her book, but presently
it came again; a prick so small and fine that it strained consciousness; an infinitesimal point
of torture, and this time Ellen, turning with a swift flirt of her head, caught the culprit.
It was that faithful little girl, who held a black-headed belt-pin in her hand; she had been
carefully separating one hair at a time from Ellen's golden curls, and tweaking it out.

Ellen looked at her with a singular expression compounded of bewilderment, of injury, of resentment,
of alarm, and of a readiness to accept it all as a somewhat peculiar advance towards good-fellowship
and a merry understanding. But the expression on that dark, somewhat grimy little face, looking
out at her from a jungle of coarse, black locks, was fairly impish, almost malicious. There
was not merriment in it so much as jibing; instead of that soft regard and worshipful admiration
which Ellen was accustomed to find in new eyes, there was resentful envy.

Then Ellen shrank, and bristled with defiance at the same time, for she had the spirit of both
the Brewsters and the Louds in her, in spite of her delicacy of organization. She was a fine
instrument, capable of chords of tragedy as well as angelic strains. She saw that the little
girl who was treating her so was dressed very poorly, that her dress was not only shabby, but
actually dirty; that she, as well as the other girl whom she noticed, had her braid tied with
an old shoe-string, and that a curious smell of leather pervaded her. Ellen continued to regard
the little girl, then suddenly she felt a hand on her shoulder, and the teacher, Miss Rebecca
Mitchell, was looking down at her. "What is the trouble?" asked Miss Mitchell. That look of
half-wondering admiration to which Ellen was accustomed was in the teacher's eyes, and Ellen
again thought her beautiful.

One of the first, though a scarcely acknowledged principle of beauty, is that of reflection
of the fairness of the observer. Ellen being as innocently self-seeking for love and admiration
as any young thing for its natural sustenance, was quick to recognize it, though she did not
understand that what she saw was herself in the teacher's eyes, and not the teacher. She gazed
up in that roseate face with the wide mouth set in an inverted bow of smile, curtained, as
it were, with smoothly crinkled auburn hair clearly outlined against the cheeks, at the palpitating
curve of shiny black-silk bosom, adorned with a festoon of heavy gold watch-chain, and thought
that here was love, and beauty, and richness, and elegance, and great wisdom, calling for reverence
but no fear. She answered not one word to the teacher's question, but continued to gaze at
her with that look of wide-eyed and contemplative regard.

"What is the trouble, Ellen?" repeated Miss Mitchell. "Why were you looking around so?"  Ellen
said nothing. The little girl behind had her head bent over her book so low that the sulky
curves of her mouth did not show. The teacher turned to her--"Abby Atkins," said she, "what
were you doing?"

Abby Atkins did not raise her studious head. She did not seem to hear.

"Abby Atkins," said the teacher, sharply, "answer me. What were you doing?"  Then the little
girl answered, with a sulky note, half growl, half whimper, like some helpless but indomitable
little trapped animal, "Nothin'."

"Ellen," said the teacher, and her voice changed indescribably. "What was she doing?"  Ellen
did not answer. She looked up in the teacher's face, then cast down her eyes and sat there,
her little hands folded in tightly clinched fists in her lap, her mouth a pink line of resistance.
"Ellen," repeated the teacher, and she tried to make her voice sharp, but in spite of herself
it was caressing. Her heart had gone out to the child the moment she had seen her enter the
school-room. She was as helpless before her as before a lover. She was wild to catch her up
and caress her instead of pestering her with questions. "Ellen, you must answer me," she said,
but Ellen sat still.

Half the scholars were on their feet, reaching and craning their necks. The teacher turned
on them, and there was no lack of sharpness in her tone. "Sit down this moment, every one of
you," she called. "Abby Atkins, if there is any more disturbance, I shall know what is at the
root of the matter. If I see you turning around again, Ellen, I shall insist upon knowing why."
Then the teacher placed a caressing hand upon Ellen's yellow head, and passed down the aisle
to her desk.

Ellen had no more trouble during the session. Abby Atkins was commendably quiet and studious,
and when called out to recitation made the best one in her class. She was really brilliant
in a defiant, reluctant fashion. However, though she did not again disturb Ellen's curls, she
glowered at her with furtive but unrelaxed hostility over her book. Especially a blue ribbon
which confined Ellen's curls in a beautiful bow fired her eyes of animosity. She looked hard
at it, then she pulled her black braid over her shoulder and felt of the hard shoe-string knot,
and frowned with an ugly frown of envy and bitterest injury, and asked herself the world-wide
and world-old question as to the why of inequality, and, though it was based on such trivialities
as blue ribbons and shoe-strings, it was none the less vital to her mind. She would have loved,
have gloried, to pull off that blue ribbon, put it on her own black braid, and tie up those
yellow curls with her own shoe-string with a vicious yank of security. But all the time it
was not so much because she wanted the ribbon as because she did not wish to be slighted in
the distribution of things. Abby Atkins cared no more for personal ornament than a wild cat,
but she wanted her just allotment of the booty of the world. So at recess she watched her chance.
Ellen was surrounded by an admiring circle of big girls, gushing with affection. "Oh, you dear
little thing," they said. "Only look at her beautiful curls. Give me a kiss, won't you, darling?"
Little reverent fingers twined Ellen's golden curls, red apples were thrust forward for her
to take bites, sticky morsels of candy were forced secretly into her hands. Abby Atkins stood
aloof. "You mean little thing," one of the big girls said suddenly, catching hold of her thin
shoulder and shaking her--"you mean little thing, I saw you."

"So did I," said another big girl, "and I was a good mind to tell on you."

"Yes, you had better look out, and not plague that dear little thing," said the other.

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," chimed in still another big girl. "Only look how pretty
she is, the little darling--the idea of your tormenting her. You deserve a good, hard whipping,
Abby Atkins."

This big girl was herself a beauty and wore a fine and precise blue-ribbon bow, and Abby Atkins
looked at her with a scowl of hatred.

"She's an ugly little thing," said the big girls among themselves as they went edging gently
and imperceptibly away towards a knot of big boys, and then Abby Atkins's chance had come.
She advanced with a spring upon Ellen Brewster, and she pulled that blue ribbon off her head
so cruelly and fiercely that she pulled out some of the golden hairs with it and threw it on
the ground, and stamped on it. Then she seized Ellen by the shoulders and proceeded to shake
her for wearing a blue ribbon when she herself wore a shoe-string, but she reckoned without
Ellen. One would as soon have expected to meet fight in a little child angel as in this Ellen
Brewster, but she did not come of her ancestors for nothing.

Although she was so daintily built that she looked smaller, she was in reality larger than
the other girl, and as she straightened herself in her wrath she seemed a head taller and proportionately
broad. She tossed her yellow head, and her face took on an expression of noble courage and
indignation, but she never said a word. She simply took Abby Atkins by the arms and lifted
her off her feet and seated her on the ground. Then she picked up her blue ribbon, and walked
off, and Abby scrambled to her feet and looked after her with a vanquished but untamed air.
Nobody had seen what happened except Abby's younger sister Maria and Granville Joy. Granville
pressed stealthily close to Ellen as she marched away and whispered, his face blazing, his
voice full of confidence and congratulation, "Say, if she'd been a boy, I'd licked her for
you, and you wouldn't hev had to tech her yourself;" and Maria walked up and eyes her prostrate
but defiantly glaring sister--"I ain't sorry one mite, Abby Atkins," she declared--"so there."

"You go 'long," returned Abby, struggling to her feet, and shaking her small skirts energetically.

"Your dress is jest as wet as if you'd set down in a puddle, and you'll catch it when you get
home," Maria said, pitilessly.

"I ain't afraid."

"What made you touch her, anyhow; she hadn't done nothin'?"

"If you want to wear shoe-strings when other folks wear ribbons, you can," said Abby Atkins.
She walked away, switching, with unabated dignity in the midst of defeat, the draggled tail
of her poor little dress. She had gone down like a cat; she was not in the least hurt except
in her sense of justice; that was jarred to a still greater lack of equilibrium. She felt as
if she had been floored by Providence in conjunction with a blue bow, and her very soul rose
in futile rebellion. But, curiously enough, her personal ire against Ellen vanished.

At the afternoon recess she gave Ellen the sound half of an old red Baldwin apple which she
had brought for luncheon, and watched her bite into it, which Ellen did readily, for she was
not a child to cherish enmity, with an odd triumph. "The other half ain't fit to eat, it's
all wormy," said Abby Atkins, flinging it away as she spoke.

"Then you ought to have kept this," Ellen cried out, holding towards her the half, minus one
little bite. But Abby Atkins shook her head forcibly. "That was why I gave it to you," said
she. "Say, didn't you never have to tie up your hair with a shoe-string?"  Ellen shook her
head, looking at her wonderingly. Then with a sudden impulse she tore off the blue ribbon from
her curls. "Say, you take it," she said, "my mother won't care. I'd just as lief wear the shoe-string,
honest."

"I don't want your blue ribbon," Abby returned, stoutly; "a shoe-string is a good deal better
to tie the hair with. I don't want your blue ribbon; I don't want no blue ribbon unless it's mine."

"It would be yours if I give it to you," Ellen declared, with blue eyes of astonishment and
consternation upon this very strange little girl.

"No, it wouldn't," maintained Abby Atkins.

But it ended in the two girls, with that wonderful and inexplicable adjustment of childhood
into one groove after harsh grating on different levels, walking off together with arms around
each other's waist, and after school began Ellen often felt a soft, cat-like pat on her head,
and turned round with a loving glance at Abby Atkins.

Ellen talked more about Abby Atkins than any other of the children when she got home, and while
her mother looked at it all easily, her grandmother was doubtful. "There's others that I should
rather have Ellen thick with," said she. "I 'ain't nothin' against the Atkinses, but they can't
have been as well brought up as some, they have had so little to do with, and their mother's
been ailin' so long."

"Ellen may as well begin as she can hold out, and be intimate with them that will be intimate
with her," Eva said, rather bitterly. Eva was married by this time, and living with Jim and
his mother. She wore in those days an expression of bitterly defiant triumph and happiness,
as of one who has wrested his sweet from fate under the ban of the law, and is determined to
get the flavor of it though the skies fall. "I suppose I did wrong marrying Jim," she often
told her sister, "but I can't help it."

"Maybe Jim will get work before long," her sister would say, consolingly.

"I have about given up," Eva would reply. "I guess Jim will have to roost on a flour-barrel
at Munsey's store the rest of his days; but as long as he belongs to me, it don't make so much
difference."

Eva had taken up an agency for a cosmetic which was manufactured by a woman in Rowe. She had
one window of the north parlor in the Tenny cottage, which had been given up to her when she
married Jim, filled with the little pink boxes containing the "Fairy Cream," and a great sign,
but the trade languished. Both Eva and Jim had tried in vain to obtain employment in factories
in other towns.

Lloyd's had not reopened, although it was April, and Andrew was drawing on his savings. Fanny
had surreptitiously answered an advertisement purporting to give instructions to women as to
the earning of large sums of money at home, and was engaged with a stock of glass and paints
which she hurriedly swept out of sight when any one's shadow passed the window, and later she
found herself to be the victim of a small swindling conspiracy, and lost the dollar which she
had invested. But Ellen knew nothing of all this. She lacked none of her accustomed necessaries
nor luxuries, and with her school a new life full of keen, new savors or relish began for her.
There were also new affections in it.

Ellen was as yet too young, and too confident in love, to have new affections plunge her into
anything but a delightful sort of anti-blossom tumult. There was no suspense, no doubt, no
jealousy, only utter acquiescence of single-heartedness, admiration, and trust. She thought
Abby Atkins and Floretta Vining lovely and dependable; she parted from them at night without
a pang, and looked forward blissfully to the meeting next morning. She also had sentiments
equally peaceful and pronounced, though instinctively more secret, towards Granville Joy. She
used to glance over towards the boys' side and meet his side-long eyes without so much a quickening
of her pulses as a quickening of her imagination.

"I know who your beau is," Floretta Vining, who was in advance of her years, said to her once,
and Ellen looked at her with half-stupid wonder.

"His first name begins with a G and his last with a J," Floretta tittered, and Ellen continued
to look at her with the faintest suspicion of a blush, because she had a feminine instinct
that a blush was in order, not because she knew of any reason for it.

"He is," said Floretta, with another exceedingly foolish giggle. "My, you are as red as a beet."

"I ain't old enough to have a beau," Ellen said, her soft cheeks becoming redder, and her baby
face all in a tremor.

"Yes, you be," Floretta said, with authority, "because you are so pretty, and have got such
pretty curls. Ben Simonds said the other day you were the prettiest girl in school."

"Then do you think he is my beau, too?" asked Ellen, innocently. But Floretta frowned, and
tittered, and hesitated.

"He said except one," she faltered out, finally.

"Well, who was that?" asked Ellen.

"How do I know?" pouted Floretta. "Mebbe it was me, though I don't think I'm so very pretty."

"Then Ben Simonds is your beau," said Ellen, reflectively.

"Yes, I guess he is," admitted Floretta.

That night, amid much wonder and tender ridicule, Ellen told her mother and Aunt Eva, and her
father, that Ben Simonds was Floretta's beau, and Granville Joy was hers. But Andrew laughed
doubtfully.

"I don't want that little thing to get such ideas into her head yet a while," he told Fanny
afterwards, but she only laughed at him, seeing nothing but the childish play of the thing;
but he, being a man, saw deeper.

However, Ellen's fondest new love was not for any of her little mates, but for her school-teacher.
To her the child's heart went out in worship. All through the spring she offered her violets--violets
gathered laboriously after school in the meadow back of her grandmother's house. She used to
skip from hillock to hillock of marsh grass with wary steps, lest she might slip and wet her
feet in the meadow ooze and incur her mother's displeasure, for Fanny, in spite of her worship
of the child, could speak with no uncertain voice. But now it has grown to be a very big one.

"Good-bye, my dear friend Mr. Knight. I like to call you my friend, and I shall always remember
how good you were to me, if, for any reason, we should never see each other again. It is very
likely we may not meet, for I don't know how long you are going to stay in Africa, or how long
I shall stay, so it may be that you will go back to England soon. I don't suppose I shall go
there. When I can leave this country it will be to sail for America with my sister--never without
her. But I shall write, as I said, in a fortnight, if all is well--indeed, I shall write whatever
happens. I shall be able to give you an address, too, I hope very much, because I should like to
hear from you. And I shall pray that you may always be happy.

"I meant this to be quite a short letter, but after all it is a long one! Good-bye again, and
give my best remembrances to Lady MacGregor and Mr. Caird, if they are not disgusted with me for the
way I am behaving. Gratefully your friend,

"VICTORIA RAY."

There was no room for any anger against the girl in Stephen's heart. He was furious, but not
with her. And he did not know with whom to be angry. There was some one--there must be some one--who
had persuaded her to take this step in the dark, and this secret person deserved all his anger
and more. To persuade a young girl to turn from the only friends she had who could protect
her, was a crime. Stephen could imagine no good purpose to be served by mystery, and he could
imagine many bad ones. The very thought of the best among them made him physically sick. There
was a throat somewhere in the world which his fingers were tingling
to choke; and he did not know where, or whose it was.

It made his head ache with a rush of beating blood not to know. And realizing suddenly, with
a shock like a blow in the face, the violence of his desire to punish some person unknown,
he saw how intimate a place the girl had in his heart. The longing to protect her, to save her
from harm or treachery, was so intense as to give pain. He felt as if a lasso had been thrown round
his body, pressing his lungs, roping his arms to his sides, holding him helpless; and for a
moment the sensation was so powerful that he was conscious of a severe effort, as if to break
away from the spell of a hypnotist.

It was only for a moment that he stood still, though a thousand thoughts ran through his head,
as in a dream--as in the dreams of last night, which had seemed so
interminable.

The thing to do was to find out at once what had become of Victoria, whom she had seen, who had
enticed her to leave the hotel. It would not take long to find out these things. At most she
could not have been gone more than thirteen or fourteen hours.

At first, in his impatience, he forgot Nevill.

In two or three minutes he had finished dressing, and was ready to start out alone when the
thought of his friend flashed into his mind. He knew that Nevill Caird, acquainted as he was
with Algiers, would be able to suggest things that he might not think of unaided. It would
be better that they two should set to work together, even though it might mean a delay of a
few minutes in the beginning.

He put Victoria's letter in his pocket, meaning to show it to Nevill as the quickest way of explaining
what had happened and what he wanted to do; but before he had got to his friend's door, he
knew that he could not bear to show the letter. There was nothing in it which Nevill might
not see, nothing which Victoria might not have wished him to see. Nevertheless it was now
his letter, and he could not have it read by any one.

He knocked at the door, but Nevill did not answer. Then Stephen guessed that his friend must be
in the garden. One of the under-gardeners, working near the house, had seen the master, and told the
guest where to go. Monsieur Caird was giving medicine to the white peacock, who was not well, and
in the stable-yard Nevill was found, in the act of pouring something down the peacock's throat
with a spoon.

When he heard what Stephen had to say, he looked very grave.

"I wish Miss Ray hadn't stopped at that hotel," he said.

"Why?" Stephen asked sharply. "You don't think the people there----"

"I don't know what to think.

But I have a sort of idea the brutes knew something last night and
wouldn't tell."

"They'll have to tell!" exclaimed Stephen.

Nevill did not answer.

"I shall go down at once," Stephen went on.

"Of course I'll go with you," said his friend.

They had forgotten about breakfast. Stopping only to get their hats, they started for the town.

XIV

"Don't
begin by accusing the landlord of anything," Nevill advised, at the hotel door. "He's got too
much Arab blood in him to stand that. You'd only make him tell you lies. We must seem to know
things, and ask questions as if we expected him to confirm our knowledge. That may confuse him if he
wants to lie. He won't be sure what ground to take."

The Arab porter was not in his place, but the proprietor sat in his den behind the window.
He was drinking a cup of thick, syrupy coffee, and soaking a rusk in it. Stephen thought this
a disgusting sight, and could hardly bear to let his eyes rest on the thick rolls of fat that
bulged over the man's low collar, all the way round his neck like a yellow ruff. Not trusting
himself to speak just then, Stephen let Caird begin the conversation.

The landlord bowed over his coffee and some letters he was reading,
but did not trouble to do more than half rise from his chair and sink
back again, solidly.

These fine gentlemen would never be clients of his, would never be instrumental in sending
any one to him. Why should he put himself out?

"We've had a letter from Miss Ray this morning," Nevill announced, after a perfunctory exchange
of "good days" in French.

The two young men both looked steadily at the proprietor of the hotel, as Nevill said these
words. The fat man did not show any sign of embarrassment, however, unless his expectant gaze
became somewhat fixed, in an effort to prevent a blink. If this were so, the change was practically imperceptible.
"She had left here before six o'clock last evening, hadn't she?"

"I cannot tell you, Monsieur. It is as I answered yesterday. I do not know the time when she
went out."

"You must know what she said when she went."

"On the contrary, Monsieur. The young lady did not speak with me herself. She sent a message."

"And
the message was that she was leaving your hotel?"

"First of all, that she had the intention of dining out. With a lady."

Stephen and Nevill looked at each other. With a lady?

Could it be possible that Mademoiselle Soubise, interested in the story, had called and taken
the girl away?

"What then?" went on Caird. "She let you know eventually that she'd made up her mind to go altogether?"

"The
message was that she might come back in some days. But yes, Monsieur, she let me know that
for the present she was leaving."

"Yet you didn't tell us this when we called!" exclaimed Stephen. "You let us think she would be
back later in the evening."

"Pardon me, Monsieur, if you remember, you asked when Mademoiselle would be back. I replied that
I did not know. It was perfectly true. And desolated as I was to inconvenience you, I could not
be as frank as my heart prompted. My regrettable reserve was the result of Mademoiselle's expressed
wish. She did not desire to have it known that she was leaving the hotel, until she herself
chose to inform her friends. As it seems you have had a letter, Monsieur, I can now speak
freely.

Yesterday evening I could not."

He looked like the last man whose heart would naturally prompt him
to frankness, but it seemed impossible to prove, at the moment, that
he was lying.

It was on the cards that Miss Ray might have requested silence as to her movements.

Stephen bit his lip to keep back an angry reproach, nevertheless,
and Caird reflected a moment before answering.

Then he said slowly; "Look here: we are both friends of Miss Ray,
the only ones she has in Algiers, except of course my aunt, Lady MacGregor,
with whom she lunched yesterday.

We are afraid she has been imprudently advised by some one, as she
is young and inexperienced in travelling.

Now, if you will find out from your servants, and also let us know from your own observation,
exactly what she did yesterday, after returning from her visit to my aunt--what callers she
had, if any; to whose house she went, and so on--we will make it worth your while. Lady MacGregor"
(he made great play with his relative's name, as if he wished the landlord to understand that
two young men were not the girl's only friends in Algiers) "is very
anxious to see Miss Ray.

To spare her anxiety, we offer a reward of a thousand francs for
reliable information.

But we must hear to-day, or to-morrow at latest."

As he evolved this proposal, Nevill and Stephen kept their eyes upon
the man's fat face.

He looked politely interested, but not excited, though the offer
of a thousand francs was large enough to rouse his cupidity, it would
seem, if he saw his way to earning it.

He shrugged his shoulders with a discouraged air when Nevill finished.

"I can tell you now, Monsieur, all that I know of Mademoiselle's movements--all that anybody in
the hotel knows, I think.

No one came to see her, except yourselves. She was out all the morning of yesterday, and did
not return here till sometime after the déjeuner. After that, she remained in her room until
towards evening. It was the head-waiter who brought me the message of which I have told you, and
requested the bill. At what hour the young lady actually went out, I do not know. The porter
can probably tell you."

"But her luggage," Stephen cut in quickly. "Where did it go? You can at least tell that?"

"Mademoiselle's luggage is still in the hotel. She asked permission to store it, all but a dressing-bag
of some sort, which, I believe she carried with her."

"In a cab?"

"That I do not know. It will be another question for the porter. But were I in the place of Monsieur
and his friend, I should have no uneasiness about the young lady.

She is certain to have found trustworthy acquaintances, for she appeared
to be very sensible."

"We shall be glad if you will let us have a short talk with several of your servants," said
Nevill--"the femme de chambre who took care of Miss Ray's room, and the waiter who served her,
as well as the porter."

"Certainly, Monsieur. They shall be brought here," the landlord assented. "I will help you by
questioning them myself."

"I think we'll do that without your help, thank you," replied Stephen drily.

The fat man looked slightly less agreeable, but touched a bell in the wall by his desk. A boy
answered and was sent to command Angéle and Ahmed to report at once. Also he was to summon
the porter, whether that man had finished his breakfast or not. These orders given, Monsieur
Constant looked at the two Englishmen as if to say, "You see! I put my whole staff at your
disposition. Does not this prove my good faith? What would you have more?"

Angéle was Algerian French, evidently of mixed parentage, like all those in the Hotel de la
Kasbah who were not Arabs. She was middle-aged, with a weary, hatchet
face, and eyes from which looked a crushed spirit.

If Stephen and Nevill could have seen Madame Constant, they would hardly have wondered at that expression.

Ahmed
had negro blood in his veins, and tried to smooth out the frizziness of the thick black hair
under his fez, with much pomatum, which smelled of cheap bergamot.

These two, with the porter who soon appeared, brushing breadcrumbs
from his jacket, stood in front of the bureau window, waiting to learn
the purpose for which they had been torn from their various occupations.

"It is these gentlemen who have something to ask you.

They do not wish me to interfere," announced the master to his servants, with a gesture. He
then turned ostentatiously to the sipping of his neglected coffee.

Nevill undertook the cross-questionings, with occasional help from Stephen, but they learned no detail
of importance.

Angéle said that she had been out when the demoiselle Americaine had left the hotel; but that
the luggage of Mademoiselle was still in her room. Ahmed had taken a message to Monsieur le Patron,
about the bill, and had brought back Mademoiselle's change, when
the note was paid.

The porter had carried down a large dressing-bag, at what time he could not be sure, but it
was long before dark. He had asked if Mademoiselle wished him to call a voiture, but she had
said no. She was going out on foot, and would presently return in a carriage. This she did.
The porter believed it was an ordinary cab in which Mademoiselle had driven back, but he had
not thought much about it, being in a hurry as he took the bag. He was at least certain that Mademoiselle
had been alone. She had received no callers while she was in the hotel, and had not been seen
speaking to any one: but she had gone out a great deal. Why had he not mentioned in the evening that
the young lady had driven away with luggage? For the sufficient reason that Mademoiselle had particularly
requested him to say nothing of her movements, should any one come to inquire. It was for the
same reason that he had been obliged to deceive Monsieur in the matter of knocking at her door.
And as the porter made this answer, he looked far more impudent than he had looked last night,
though he was smiling blandly.

How much of this was lies and how much truth?

Stephen wondered, when, having given up hope of learning more from landlord or servants, they
left the hotel.

Nevill had to confess that he was puzzled.

"Their stories hold together well enough," he said, "but if they have anything to hide (mind,
I don't say they have) they're the sort to get up their tale beforehand, so as to make it water-tight.
We called last night, and that man Constant must have known we'd come again, whether we heard
from Miss Ray or whether we didn't--still more, if we didn't. Easy as falling off a log to put
the servants up to what he wanted them to say, and prepare them for questions, without giving
them tips under our noses."

"If they know anything that fat old swine doesn't want them to give away, we can bribe it out
of them," said Stephen, savagely. "Surely these Arabs and half-breeds love money."

"Yes, but there's something else they hold higher, most of them, I will say in their favour--loyalty
to their own people. If this affair has to do with Arabs, like as not we might offer all we've
got without inducing them to speak--except to tell plausible lies and send us farther along
the wrong track. It's a point of pride with these brown faces. Their own above the Roumis, and I'm
hanged if I can help respecting them for that, lies and all."

"But why should they lie?" broke out Stephen. "What can it be to them?"

"Nothing, in all probability," Nevill tried to soothe him.

"The chances are, they've told us everything they know, in good faith, and that they're just as
much in the dark about Miss Ray's movements as we are--without the clue we have, knowing as
we do why she came to Algiers. It's mysterious enough anyhow, what's become of her; but it's
more likely than not that she kept her own secret. You say she admitted in her letter having
heard something which she didn't mention to us when she was at my house; so she must have got
a clue, or what she thought was a clue, between the time when we took her from the boat to the
Hotel de la Kasbah, and the time when she came to us for lunch."

"It's simply hideous!" Stephen exclaimed. "The only way I can see now is to call in the police.
They must find out where that cab came from and where it took Miss Ray. That's the important
thing."

"Yes, to get hold of the cabman is the principal thing," said Nevill,
without any ring of confidence in his voice.

"But till we learn the contrary, we may as well presume she's safe. As for the police, for
her sake they must be a last resort."

"Let's go at once and interview somebody. But there's one hope. She may have gone to Tlemcen
to see that Kabyle maid of Mademoiselle Soubise, for herself. Perhaps that's why she didn't encourage
us to motor there. She's jolly independent."

Nevill's face brightened.

"When we've done what we can in Algiers, we might run there ourselves in the car, just as I
proposed before," he said eagerly. "If nothing came of it, we wouldn't be wasting time, you know.
She warned you not to expect news for a fortnight, so there's no
use hanging about here in hopes of a letter or telegram. We can go
to Tlemcen and get back inside five days. What do you say?"

What
Stephen might have said was, that they could save the journey by telegraphing
to Mademoiselle Soubise to ask whether Miss Ray had arrived in Tlemcen.
But the brightness in Nevill's eyes and the hopefulness in his voice
kept back the prosaic suggestion.

"I say, by all means let's go to
Tlemcen," he answered. "To-morrow, after we've found out what we can
here about the cab, inquired at the railway stations and so on. Besides,
we can at least apply to the police for information about Ben Halim.
If we learn he's alive, and where he is living, it may be almost the
same as knowing where Miss Ray has gone."

XV

Nothing could be heard
of Victoria at any place of departure for ships, nor at the railway
stations. Stephen agreed with Nevill that it would not be fair to
lay the matter in the hands of the police, lest in some way the girl's
mysterious "plan" should be defeated. But he could not put out of
his head an insistent idea that the Arab on board the Charles Quex
might stand for something in this underhand business. Stephen could
not rest until he had found out the name of this man, and what had
become of him after arriving at Algiers. As for the name, having appeared
on the passenger list, it was easily obtained without expert help.
The Arab was a certain Sidi Maïeddine ben el Hadj Messaoud; and when
Jeanne Soubise was applied to for information concerning him, she
was able to learn from her Arab friends that he was a young man of
good family, the son of an Agha or desert chief, whose douar lay far
south, in the neighbourhood of El-Aghouat. He was respected by the
French authorities and esteemed by the Governor of Algiers. Known
to be ambitious, he was anxious to stand well with the ruling power,
and among the dissipated, sensuous young Arabs of his class and generation,
he was looked upon as an example and a shining light. The only fault
found in him by his own people was that he inclined to be too modern,
too French in his political opinions; and his French friends found
no fault with him at all.

It seemed impossible that a person so highly
placed would dare risk his future by kidnapping a European girl, and
Jeanne Soubise advised Stephen to turn his suspicions in another direction.
Still he would not be satisfied, until he had found and engaged a
private detective, said to be clever, who had lately seceded from
a Paris agency and set up for himself in Algiers. Through him, Stephen
hoped to learn how Sidi Maïeddine ben el Hadj Messaoud had occupied
himself after landing from the Charles Quex; but all he did learn
was that the Arab, accompanied by his servant and no one else, had,
after calling on the Governor, left Algiers immediately for El-Aghouat.
At least, he had taken train for Bogharie, and was known to have affairs
of importance to settle between his father the Agha, and the French
authorities. Secret inquiries at the Hotel de la Kasbah elicited answers,
unvaryingly the same. Sidi Maïeddine ben el Hadj Messaoud was not
a patron of the house, and had never been seen there. No one answering
at all to his description had stopped in, or even called at, the hotel.

Of
course, the value of such assurances was negatived by the fact that
Arabs hold together against foreigners, and that if Si Maïeddine wished
to be incognito among his own people, his wish would probably be respected,
in spite of bribery. Besides, he was rich enough to offer bribes on
his own part. Circumstantial evidence, however, being against the
supposition that the man had followed Victoria after landing, Stephen
abandoned it for the time, and urged the detective, Adolphe Roslin,
to trace the cabman who had driven Miss Ray away from her hotel. Roslin
was told nothing about Victoria's private interests, but she was accurately
described to him, and he was instructed to begin his search by finding
the squint-eyed cab-driver who had brought the girl to lunch at Djenan
el Djouad.

Only in the affair of Cassim ben Halim did Stephen and
Nevill decide to act openly, Nevill using such influence as he had
at the Governor's palace. They both hoped to learn something which
in compassion or prudence had been kept from the girl; but they failed,
as Victoria had failed. If a scandal had driven the Arab captain of
Spahis from the army and from Algiers, the authorities were not ready
to unearth it now in order to satisfy the curiosity, legitimate or
illegitimate, of two Englishmen.

Captain Cassim ben Halim el Cheik
el Arab, had resigned from the army on account of ill-health, rather
more than nine years ago, and having sold his house in Algiers had
soon after left Algeria to travel abroad. He had never returned, and
there was evidence that he had been burned to death in a great fire
at Constantinople a year or two later. The few living relatives he
had in Algeria believed him to be dead; and a house which Ben Halim
had owned not far from Bou Saada, had passed into the hands of his
uncle, Caïd of a desert-village in the district. As to Ben Halim's
marriage with an American girl, nobody knew anything. The present
Governor and his staff had come to Algiers after his supposed death;
and if Nevill suspected a deliberate reticence behind certain answers
to his questions, perhaps he was mistaken. Then the boy went on down the street, but he
did not whistle, and Ellen went back to the doorstep, and, looking about to be sure that none
of the men in the sitting-room saw, pulled off one little shoe and drew forth a sprig of southernwood,
or boy's-love, which was crushed under her foot.

That day Floretta Vining had told her that if she would put a sprig of boy's-love in her shoe,
the very first boy she met would be the one she was going to marry; and Ellen, who was passing
from one grade of school to another, had tried it.

Chapter XIV

The high-school master was a distant relative of the Lloyd's, through whom he had obtained
the position. One evening when he was taking tea with them at Cynthia Lennox's, he spoke of
Ellen. "I have one really remarkable scholar," he said, with a curious air of self-gratulation,
as if he were principally responsible for it; "her name is Brewster--Ellen Brewster."

"Good land! That must be the child that ran away five or six years ago, and all the town up
in arms over it," said Mrs. Norman Lloyd. "Don't you remember, Cynthia?"

"Yes," replied Cynthia, and continued pouring tea. Cynthia was very little changed. In some
faces time seems to engrave lines delicately, once for all, and then lay by. She was rather
more charming now than when one had looked at her with any expectancy of youth, since there
was now no sense of disappointment.

"I remember that," said Norman Lloyd. "The child would never tell where she had been. A curious
case."

"Well," said the school-master, "leaving that childish episode out of the question, she has
a really remarkable mind. If she were a boy, I should advise a thorough education and a profession.
I should as it is, if her family were able to bear the expense. She has that intuitive order
of mind which is wonderful enough, though not, after all, so rare in a girl; but in addition
she has the logical, which, according to my experience, is almost unknown in a woman. She ought
to have an education."

"But," said Risley, "what is the use of educating that unfortunate child?"

"What do you mean?"

"What I say. What is the use? There she is in her sphere of life, the daughter of a factory
operative, in all probability in after-years to be the wife of one and the mother of others.
Nothing but a rich marriage can save her, and that she is not likely to make. Milk-maids are
more likely to make rich marriages than factory girls; there is a certain savor of romance
about milk, and the dewy meadows, and the breath of kine, but a shoe factory is brutally realistic
and illusionary. Now, why do you want to increase the poor child's horizon farther than her
little feet can carry her? Fit her to be a good female soldier in the ranks of labor, to be
a good wife and mother to the makers of shoes, to wash and iron their uniforms of toil, to
cook well the food which affords them the requisite nourishment to make shoes, to appreciate
book-lore, which is a pleasure and a profit to the makers of shoes; possibly in the non-event
of marriage she will make shoes herself. The system of education in our schools is all wrong.
It is both senseless and futile. Look at the children filing past to school, and look at their
fathers, and their mothers too, filing past to the factory. Look at their present, and look
at their future. And look at the trash taught them in their text-books--trash from its utter
dissociation with their lives. You might as well teach a Zulu lace-work, instead of the use
of the assagai."

"Now look here, Mr. Risley," said the school-master, his face flushing, "is not--I beg your
pardon, of course--this view of yours a little narrow and ultra-conservative? You do not want
to establish a permanent factory-operative class in this country, do you? That is what your
theory would ultimately tend towards. Ought not these children be given their chance to rise
in the ranks; ought they to be condemned to tread in the same path as their fathers?"

"I would have those little paths which intersect every unoccupied field in this locality worn
by the feet of these men and their children after them unto the third and fourth generation,"
said Risley. "If not, where is our skilled labor?"

"Oh, Mr. Risley," said Mrs. Lloyd, anxiously, "you wouldn't want all those dear little children
to work as hard as their fathers, and not do any better, would you?"

"If they don't, who is going to make our shoes, dear Mrs. Lloyd?" asked Risley.

Mrs. Lloyd and the school-master stared at him, and Lloyd laughed his low, almost mirthless laugh.

"Don't you know, Edward," he said, "that Mr. Risley is not in earnest, and speaks with the
deadly intent of an anarchist with a bomb in his bag? He is the most out-and-out radical in
the country. If there were a strike, and I did not yield to the demands of the oppressed, and
imported foreign labor, I don't know that my life would be safe from him."

"Then you do approve of a higher education?" asked the school-master, while Mrs. Lloyd stared
from one to the other in bewilderment.

"Yes, if we and our posterity have to go barefoot," said Risley, laughing out with a sudden
undertone of seriousness.

"I suppose everybody could get accustomed to going barefoot after a while," said Mrs. Lloyd.
"Do you suppose that dear little thing was barefooted when she ran away, Cynthia?"

Risley answered as if he had been addressed. "I can vouch for the fact that she was not, Mrs.
Lloyd," he said. "They would sooner have walked on red-hot ploughshares themselves than let her."

"Her father is getting quite an old man," Norman Lloyd said, with no apparent relevancy, as
if he were talking to himself.

All the time Cynthia Lennox had been quietly sitting at the head of the table. When the rest
of the company had gone, and she and Risley were alone, seated in the drawing-room before the
parlor fire, for it was a chilly day, she turned her fair, worn face towards him on the crimson
velvet of her chair. "Do you know why I did not speak and tell them where the child was that
time?" she asked.

"Because of your own good sense?"

"No; because of you."

He looked at her adoringly. She was older than he, her beauty rather recorded than still evident
on her face; she had been to him from the first like a fair, forbidden flower behind a wall
of prohibition, but nothing could alter his habit of loving her.

"Yes," said she. "It was more on your account than on my own; confession would be good for
the soul. The secret has always rankled in my pride. I would much rather defy opinion than
fly before it. But I know that you would mind. However, there was another reason."

"What?"

She hesitated a little and colored, even laughed a little, embarrassed laugh which was foreign
to her. "Well, Lyman," said she, finally, "one reason why I did not speak was that I see my
way clear to making up to that child and her parents for any wrong which I may have done them
by causing them a few hours' anxiety. When she has finished the high-school I mean to send
her to college."

Chapter XV

When Ellen was about sixteen, in her second year at the high-school, her own family never looked
at her without a slight shock of wonder, as before the unexpected. Her mates, being themselves
in the transition state, received her unquestioningly as a fellow-traveller, and colored like
themselves with the new lights of the journey. But Ellen's father and mother and grandmother
never ceased regarding her with astonishment and admiration and something like alarm. While
they regarded Ellen with the utmost pride, they still privately regretted this perfection of
bloom which was the forerunner of independence of the parent stalk--at least, Andrew did. Andrew
had grown older and more careworn; his mine had not yet paid any dividends, but he had scattering
jobs of work, and with his wife's assistance had managed to rub along, and his secret was still
safe.

One day in February there was a half-holiday. Lloyd's was shut for the rest of the day, for
his brother in St. Louis was dead, and had been brought to Rowe to be buried, and his funeral
was at two o'clock.

"Goin' to the funeral, old man?" one of Andrew's fellow-workmen had asked, jostling him as
he went out of the shop at noon. Before Andrew could answer, another voice broke in fiercely.
It belonged to Joseph Atkins, who was ghastly that day.

"I ain't goin' to no funerals," he said; "guess they won't shut up shop for mine."  Then he
coughed. His daughter Abby, who had been working in the factory for some time then, pressed
close behind her father, and the expression in her face was an echo of his.

"When I strike, that's what I'm going to strike for--to have the shop shut up the day of my
funeral," said she; and the remark had a ghastly flippancy, contradicted by her intense manner.
A laugh went around, and a young fellow with a handsome, unshaven face caught her by the arm.

"You'd better strike to have the shop shut up the day you're married," said he; but Abby flung
away from him.

"I'll thank you to let me alone, Tom Hardy," she said, with a snap; and the men laughed harder.

Abby was attractive to men in spite of her smallness and leanness and incisiveness of manner.
She was called mighty smart and dry, which was the shop synonym for witty, and her favors,
possibly because she never granted them, were accounted valuable. Abby Atkins had more admirers
than many a girl who was prettier and presumably more winning in every way, and could have
married twice to their once. But Abby had no wish for a lover. "I've got all I can do to earn
my own living and the living of them that belong to me," said she.

That afternoon Andrew Brewster stayed at home. After dinner Eva Tenny and her little girl came
in, and Ellen went down street on an errand.

Mrs. Zelotes Brewster was crossing her yard to her son's house when she saw Ellen passing,
and paused to gaze at her with that superb pride which pertains to self and is yet superior
to it. It was the idealized pride of her own youth. When she proceeded again against the February
gusts, it was with an unconscious aping of her granddaughter's freedom of gait. Mrs. Zelotes
wore an old red cashmere scarf crossed over her bosom; she held up her black skirts in front,
and they trailed pointedly in the rear; she also stood well back on her heels, and when she
paused in the wind-swept yard presented a curious likeness to an old robin pausing for reconnoitre.
Fanny and Eva Tenny in the next house saw her coming.

"Look at her holding up her dress in front and letting it drag in the back," said Eva. "It
always seemed to me there was somethin' wrong about any woman that held up her dress in front
and let it drag behind."

Eva retained all the coarse beauty of her youth, but lines of unalterable hardness were fixed
on her forehead and at her mouth corners, and the fierce flush in her cheeks was as set as
paint. Her beauty had endured the siege; no guns of mishaps could affect it, but that charm
of evanescence which awakens tenderness was gone. Jim Tenny's affection seemed to be waning,
and Eva looked at herself in the glass even when bedecked with tawdry finery, and owned that
she did not wonder. She strained up her hair into the latest perkiness of twist, and crimped
it, and curled her feathers, and tied her ribbons not as much in hope as in a stern determination
to do her part towards the furbishing of her faded star of attraction. "Jim don't act as if
he thought so much of me, an' I dun'no' as I wonder," she told her sister.

Fanny looked at her critically. "You mean you ain't so good-lookin' as you used to be?" said she.

Eva nodded.

"Well, if that is all men care for us," said Fanny.

"It ain't," said Eva, "only it's the key to it. It's like losin' the key and not bein' able
to get in the door in consequence."

"It wa'n't my husband's key," said Fanny, with a glance at her own face, faded as to feature
and bloom, but intensified as to love and daily duty, like that of a dog sharpened to one faithfulness
of existence.

"Andrew ain't Jim," said Eva, shortly.

"I know he ain't," Fanny assented, with emphasis.

"But I wouldn't swap off my husband for a dozen of yours," said Eva.

"Well, I wouldn't swap off mine for a thousand of yours," returned Fanny, sharply; and there
might have been one of the old-time tussles between the sisters had not Eva's violent, half-bitter
sense of humor averted it. She broke into a hard laugh.

"Good Lord," she said, "I dun'no' as I should want a thousand like Jim. Seems to me it would
be considerable care."

Fanny began to speak, but checked herself. She had heard rumors regarding Jim Tenny of late
and had flown fiercely with denial at the woman who told her, and had not repeated them to
her sister.

She was thinking how she had heard that Jim had been seen driving in Wenham with Aggie Morse
several times lately. Aggie Morse had been Aggie Bemis, Jim's old sweetheart. She had married
a well-to-do merchant in Wenham, who died six months before and left her with considerable
property. It was her own smart little turn-out in which she had been seen with Jim.

Eva was working in the shop, and Jim had been out of employment for nearly a year, and living
on his wife. There was a demand for girls and not for men just then, so Jim loafed. His old
mother cared for the house as well as she was able, and Eva did the rest nights and mornings.
At first Jim had tried to help about the house-work, but Eva had interfered.

"It ain't a man's work," said she. "Your mother can leave the hard part of it till I get home."
Eva used to put the money she earned surreptitiously into her husband's pockets that he might
not feel his manly pride injured, but she defeated her own ends by her very solicitude. Jim
Tenny began to reason that his wife saw his shame and ignominious helplessness, else she would
not have been so anxious to cover it. The stoop of discouragement which Eva used to fear for
his shoulders did not come, but, instead, something worse--the defiant set-back of recklessness.
He took his wife's earnings and despised himself. Whenever he paid a bill, he was sure the
men in the store said, the minute his back was turned, "It's his wife's money that paid for
that."  He took to loafing on sunny corners, and eying the passers-by with the blank impudence
of regard of those outside the current of life. When his wife passed by on her way from the
shop he nodded to her as if she were a stranger, and presently followed her home at a distance.
He would not be seen on the street with her if he could avoid it. If by any chance when he
was standing on his corner of idleness his little girl came past, he melted away imperceptibly.
He could not bear it that the child should see him standing there in that company of futility
and openly avowed inadequacy. The child was a keen-eyed, slender little girl, resembling neither
father nor mother, but looking rather like her paternal grandmother, who was a fair, attenuated
woman, with an intelligence which had sharpened on herself for want of anything more legitimate,
and worn her out by the unnatural friction. The little Amabel, for Eva had been romantic in
the naming of her child, was an old-fashioned-looking child in spite of Eva's careful decoration
of the little figure in the best childish finery which she could muster.

Little Amabel was reading a child's book at another window. When Mrs. Zelotes entered she eyed
her with the sharpness and inscrutable conclusions therefrom of a kitten, then turned a leaf
in her book.

When Mrs. Zelotes had greeted her daughter-in-law and Eva, she looked with disapproval at Amabel.

"When I was a little girl I should have been punished if I hadn't got up and curtsied and said
good-afternoon when company came in," she remarked, severely.

Amabel was not a favorite outside of her own family. People used to stare aghast at her unexpected
questions and demands delivered in a shrill clarion as from some summit of childish wisdom,
and they said she was a queer child. She yielded always to command from utter helplessness,
but the why of obedience was strongly alert within her. The child might have been in some subtle
and uncanny fashion the offspring of her age and generation instead of her natural parents,
she was so unlike either of them, and so much a product of the times, with her meekness and
slavishness of weakness and futility, and her unquenchable and unconquerable vitality of dissent.

Ellen adored the little Amabel. Presently, when she returned from her errand down-town, she
cried out with delight when she saw her; and the child ran to meet her, and clung to her, with
her flaxen head snuggled close to her cheek. Ellen caught the child up, seated herself, and
sat cuddling her as she used to cuddle her doll.

"You dear little thing!" she murmured, "you dear little thing! You did come to see Ellen, didn't
you?"  And the child gazed up in the young girl's face with a rapt expression. Nothing can
express the admiration, which is almost as unquestionable as worship, of a very little girl
for a big one. Amabel loved her mother with a rather unusual intensity for a child, but Ellen
was what she herself would be when she was grown up. Through Ellen her love of self and her
ambition budded into blossom. Ellen could do nothing wrong because she did what she herself
would do when she was grown. She never questioned Ellen for her reasons.

Mrs. Zelotes kept looking at the two, with pride in Ellen and disapproval of her caresses of
the child. "Seems to me you might speak to your own folks as well as to have no eyes for anybody
but that child," she said, finally.

"Why, grandma, I spoke to you just a little while ago," returned Ellen. "You know I saw you
just a few minutes before I went down-town."  Ellen straightened the child on her knees, and
began to try to twist her soft, straight flaxen locks into curls. Andrew lounged in from the
kitchen and sat down and regarded Ellen fondly. The girl's cheeks were a splendid color from
her walk in the cold wind, her hair around her temples caught the light from the window, and
seemed to wreathe her head with a yellow flame. She tossed the child about with lithe young
arms, whose every motion suggested reserves of tender strength. Ellen was more beautiful than
she had ever been before, and yet something was gone from her face, though only temporarily,
since the lines for the vanished meaning was still there. All the introspection and dreaminess
and poetry of her face were gone, for the girl was, for the time, overbalanced on the physical
side of her life. The joy of existence for itself alone was intoxicating her. The innocent
frivolities of her sex had seized her too, and the instincts which had not yet reached her
brain nor gone farther than her bounding pulses of youth. "Ellen is getting real fond of dress,"
Fanny often said to Andrew. He only laughed at that. "Well, pretty birds like pretty feathers,
and no wonder," said he. But he did not laugh when Fanny added that Ellen seemed to think more
about the boys than she used to. There was scarcely a boy in the high-school who was not Ellen's
admirer. It was a curious happening in those days when Ellen was herself in much less degree
the stuff of which dreams are made than she had been and would be thereafter, that she was
the object of so many. Every morning when she entered the school-room she was reflected in
a glorious multiple of ideals in no one could tell how many boyish hearts. Floretta Vining
began to imitate her, and kept close to Ellen with supremest diplomacy, that she might thereby
catch some of the crumbs of attention which fell from Ellen's full table. Often when some happy
boy had secured a short monopoly of Ellen, his rival took up with Floretta, and she was content,
being one of those purely feminine things who have no pride when the sweets of life are concerned.
Floretta dressed her hair like Ellen's, and tied her neck-ribbons the same way; she held her
head like her, she talked like her, except when the two girls were absolutely alone; then she
sometimes relapsed suddenly, to Ellen's bewilderment, into her own ways, and her blue eyes
took on an expression as near animosity as her ingratiating politic nature could admit.

Ellen did not affiliate as much with Floretta as with Maria Atkins. Abby had gone to work in
the shop, and so Ellen did not see so much of her. Maria was not as much a favorite with the
boys as she had been since they had passed and not yet returned to that stage when feminine
comradeship satisfies; so Ellen used to confide in her with a surety of sympathy and no contention.
Once, when the girls were sleeping together, Ellen made a stupendous revelation to Maria, having
first bound her to inviolable secrecy. "I love a boy," said she, holding Maria's little arm
tightly.

"I know who," said Maria, with a hushed voice.

"He kissed me once, and then I knew it," said Ellen.

"Well, I guess he loves you," said Maria. Ellen shivered and drew a fluttering sigh of assent.
Then the two girls lay in each other's arms, looking at the moonlight which streamed in through
the window. God knew in what realms of pure romance, and of passion so sublimated by innocence
that no tinge of earthliness remained, the two wandered in their dreams.

At last, that afternoon in February, Ellen put down little Amabel and got out her needle-work.
She was making a lace neck-tie for her own adornment. She showed it to her grandmother at her
mother's command. "It's real pretty," said Mrs. Zelotes. "Ellen takes after the Brewsters;
they were always handy with their needles."

"Can uncle sew?" asked little Amabel, suddenly, from her corner, in a tone big with wonder.

Eva and the others chuckled, but Mrs. Zelotes eyed the child severely. "Little girls shouldn't
ask silly questions," said she.

Andrew passed his hand with a rough caress over the small flaxen head. "Uncle Andrew can't
sew anything but shoes," said he.

Little Amabel's question had aroused in Mrs. Zelotes a carping spirit even against Ellen. Presently
she turned to her. "I heard something about you," said she. "I want to know if it is true.
I heard that you were walking home from school with that Joy boy one day last week."  Ellen
looked at her grandmother without flinching, though the pink was over her face and neck.

"Yes'm, I did," said she.

"Well, I think it's about time it was put a stop to," said Mrs. Zelotes. "That Joy boy!"

Then Fanny lost her temper. "I can manage my own daughter, Grandma Brewster," said she, "and
I'll thank you to attend to your own affairs."

"You don't seem to know enough to manage her," retorted Mrs. Zelotes, "if you let her go traipsin'
round with that Joy boy."

The warfare waged high for a time. Andrew withdrew to the kitchen. Ellen took little Amabel
up in her own chamber and showed her her beautiful doll, which looked not a day older, so carefully
had she been cherished, than when she first had her. Ellen felt both resentment and shame,
and also a fierce dawning of partisanship towards Granville Joy. "Why should my grandmother
speak of him so scornfully?" she asked herself. "He is a real good boy."

That night was very cold, a night full of fierce white glitter of frost and moonlight, and
raging with a turbulence of winds. Ellen lay awake listening to them. Presently between the
whistle of the wind she heard another, a familiar pipe from a boyish throat. She sprang out
of bed and peeped from her window, and there was a dark, slight figure out in the yard, and
he was looking up at her window, whistling. Shame, and mirth, and also exultation, which overpowered
them both, stirred within the child's breast. She had read of things like this. Here was her
boy lover coming out this bitter night just for the sake of looking up at her window. She adored
him for it. Then she heard a window raised with a violent rasp across the yard, and saw her
grandmother's night-capped head thrust forth. She heard her shrill, imperious voice call out
quite distinctly, "Boy, who be you?"

The lovelorn whistler ceased his pipe, and evidently, had he consulted his own discretion,
would have shown a pair of flying heels, but he walked bravely up to the window and the night-capped
head and replied. Ellen could not hear what he said, but she distinguished plainly enough her
grandmother's concluding remarks.

"Go home," cried Mrs. Zelotes; "go home just as fast as you can and go to bed. Go home!"  Mrs.
Zelotes made a violent shooting motion with her hands and her white head as if he were a cat,
and Granville Joy obeyed. However, Ellen heard his brave, retreating whistle far down the road.
She went back to bed, and lay awake with a fervor of young love roused into a flame by opposition
swelling high in her heart. But the next afternoon, after school, Ellen, to Granville Joy's
great bliss and astonishment, insinuated herself, through the crowd of out-going scholars,
close to him, and presently, had he not been so incredulous, for he was a modest boy, he would
have said it was by no volition of his own that he found himself walking down the street with
her. And when they reached his house, which was only half-way to her own, she looked at him
with such a wistful surprise as he motioned to leave her that he could not mistake it, and
he walked on at her side quite to her own house. Granville Joy was a gentle boy, young for
his age, which was a year more than Ellen's. He had a face as gentle as a girl's, and really
beautiful. Women all loved him, and the school-girls raised an admiring treble chorus in his
praise whenever his name was spoken. He was saved from effeminacy by nervous impulses which
passed for sustained manly daring. "He once licked a boy a third bigger than he was, and you
needn't call him sissy," one girl said once to a decrying friend. To-day, as the boy and girl
neared Mrs. Zelotes's house, Granville was conscious of an inward shrinking before the remembrance
of the terrible old lady. He expected every minute to hear the grating upward slide of the
window and that old voice, which had in it a terrible intimidation of feminine will. Granville
had a mother as gentle as himself, and a woman with the strength of her own conviction upon
her filled him with awe as of something anomalous. He wondered uneasily what he should do if
the old lady were to hail him and call him to an account again, whether it would be a more
manly course to face her, or obey, since she was Ellen's grandmother. He kept an uneasy eye
upon the house, and presently, when he saw the stern old face at the window, he quailed a little.
But Ellen for the first time in her life took his arm, and the two marched past under the fire
of Mrs. Zelotes's gaze. Ellen had retaliated, not nobly, but as naturally under the conditions
of her life at that time as the branch of a tree blows east before the west wind.

Chapter XVI

Ellen, when she graduated, was openly pronounced the flower of her class. Not a girl equalled
her, not a boy surpassed her. When Ellen came home one night about two months before her graduation,
and announced that she was to have the valedictory, such a light of pure joy flashed over her
mother's face that she looked ten years younger.

"Well, I guess your father will be pleased enough," she said. She was hard at work, finishing
women's wrappers of cheap cotton. The hood industry had failed some time before, since the
hoods had gone out of fashion. The same woman had taken a contract to supply a large firm with
wrappers, and employed many in the neighborhood, paying them the smallest possible prices.
This woman was a usurer on a scale so pitiful and petty that it almost condoned usury. Sometimes
a man on discovering the miserable pittance for which his wife toiled during every minute which
she could snatch from her household duties and the care of her children, would inveigh against
it. "That woman is cheating you," he would say, to be met with the argument that she herself
was only making ten cents on a wrapper. Looked at in that light, the wretched profit of the
workers did not seem so out of proportion. It was usury in a nutshell, so infinitesimal as
almost to escape detection. Fanny worked every minute which she could secure on these wrappers--the
ungainly, slatternly home-gear of other poor women. There was an air of dejected femininity
and slipshod drudgery about every fold of one of them when it was hung up finished. Fanny used
to keep them on a row of hooks in her bedroom until a dozen were completed, when she carried
them to her employer, and Ellen used to look at them with a sense of depression. She imagined
worn, patient faces of the sisters of poverty above the limp collars, and poor, veinous hands
dangling from the clumsy sleeves.

Fanny would never allow Ellen to assist her in this work, though she begged hard to do so.
"Wait till you get out of school," said she. "You've got enough to do while you are in school."

When Ellen told her about the valedictory, Fanny was so overjoyed that she lost sight of her
work, and sewed in the sleeves wrong. "There, only see what you have made me do!" she cried,
laughing with delight at her own folly. "Only see, you have made me sew in both these sleeves
wrong. You are a great child. Another time you had better keep away with your valedictories
till I get my wrapper finished."  Ellen looked up from the book which she had taken.

"Let me rip them out for you, mother," she said.

"No, you keep on with your study--it won't take me but a minute. I don't know what your father
will say. It is a great honor to be chosen to write the valedictory out of that big class.
I guess your father will be pleased."

"I hope I can write a good one," said Ellen.

"Well, if you can't, I'd give up my beat," said the mother, looking at her with enthusiasm,
and speaking with scornful chiding. "Why don't you go over and tell your grandmother Brewster?
She'll be tickled 'most to death."

Ellen had not been gone long when Andrew came home, coming into the yard, bent as if beneath
some invisible burden of toil. Just then he had work, but not in Lloyd's. He had grown too
old for Lloyd's, and had been discharged long ago.

He had so far been able to conceal from Fanny the fact that he had withdrawn all his little
savings to invest in that mining stock. The stock had not yet come up, as he had expected.
He very seldom had a circular reporting progress nowadays. When he did have one in the post-office
his heart used to stand still until he had torn open the envelope and read it. It was uniformly
not so hopeful as formerly, while speciously apologetic. Andrew still had faith, although his
heart was sick with its long deferring. He could not actually believe that all his savings
were gone, sunken out of sight forever in this awful shaft of miscalculation and misfortune.
What he dreaded most was that Fanny should find out, as she would have to were he long out
of employment.

Andrew, when he entered the house on his return from work, had come to open a door into the
room where his wife was, with a deprecating and apologetic air. He gained confidence when,
after a few minutes, the sore subject had not been broached.

To-night, as usual, when he came into the sitting-room where Fanny was sewing it was with a
sidelong glance of uneasy deprecation towards her, and an attempt to speak easily, as if he
had nothing on his mind.

"Pretty warm day," he began, but his wife cut him short. She faced around towards him beaming,
her work--a pink wrapper--slid from her lap to the floor.

"What do you think, Andrew?" she said. "What do you s'pose has happened? Guess."  Andrew laughed
gratefully, and with the greatest alacrity. Surely this was nothing about mining-stocks, unless,
indeed, she had heard, and the stocks had gone up, but that seemed to much like the millennium.
He dismissed that from his mind before it entered. He stood before her in his worn clothes.
He always wore a collar and a black tie, and his haggard face was carefully shaven. Andrew
was punctiliously neat, on Ellen's account. He was always thinking, suppose he should meet
Ellen coming home from school, with some young ladies whose fathers were rich and did not have
to work in the shop, how mortified she might feel if he looked shabby and unkempt.

"Guess, Andrew," she said.

"What is it?" said Andrew.

"Oh, you guess."

"I don't see what it can be, Fanny."

"Well, Ellen has got the valedictory. What's the matter with you? Be you deaf? Ellen has got
the valedictory out of all them girls and boys."

"She has, has she?" said Andrew. He dropped into a chair and looked at his wife. There was
something about the intense interchange of confidence of delight between these two faces of
father and mother which had almost the unrestraint of lunacy. Andrew's jaw fairly dropped with
his smile, which was a silent laugh rather than a smile; his eyes were wild with delight. "She
has, has she?" he kept repeating.

"Yes, she has," said Fanny. She tossed her head with an incomparable pride; she coughed a little,
affected cough. "I s'pose you know what a compliment it is?" said she. "It means that she's
smarter than all them boys and girls--the smartest one in her whole class."

"Yes, I s'pose it does," said Andrew. "So she has got it! Well!"

"There she comes now," said Fanny, "and Grandma Brewster."

Andrew borrowed money to buy a gold watch and chain for a graduating gift for his daughter.
He would scarcely have essayed anything quite so magnificent, but Fanny innocently tempted
him. The two had been sitting in the door in the cool of the evening, one day in June, about
two weeks before the graduation, and had just watched Ellen's light muslin skirts flutter out
of sight. She had gone down-town to purchase some ribbon for her graduating dress--she and
Floretta Vining, who had come over to accompany her. "I feel kind of anxious to have her have
something pretty when she graduates," Fanny said, speaking as if she were feeling her way into
a mind of opposition. Neither she nor Andrew had ever owned a watch, and the scheme seemed
to her breathless with magnificence.

"Yes, she ought to have something pretty," agreed Andrew.

"I don't want her to feel ashamed when she sees the other girls' presents," said Fanny.

"That's so," assented Andrew.

"Well," said Fanny, "I've been thinkin'--"

"What?"

"Well, I've been thinkin' that--of course your mother is goin' to give her the dress, and that's
all, of course, and it's a real handsome present. I ain't sayin' a word against that; but there
ain't anybody else to give her much except us. Poor Eva 'd like to, but she can't; it takes
all she earns, since Jim's out of work, and I don't know what she's goin' to do. So that leaves
nobody but us, and I've been thinkin'--I dun'no' what you'll say, Andrew, but I've been thinkin'--s'pose
you took a little money out of the bank, and--got Ellen--a watch."  Fanny spoke the last word
in a faint whisper. She actually turned pale in the darkness.

"A watch?" repeated Andrew.

"Yes, a watch. I've always wanted Ellen to have a gold watch and chain. I've always thought
she could, and so she could if you hadn't been out of work so much."

"Yes, she could," said Andrew--"a watch and mebbe a piano. I thought I'd be back in Lloyd's
before now. Well, mebbe I shall before long. They say there's better times comin' by fall."

"Well, Ellen will be graduated by that time," said Fanny, "and she ought to have the watch
now if she's ever goin' to. She'll never think so much of it. Floretta Vining is goin' to have
a watch, too. Mrs. Cross says her mother told her so; said Mr. Vining had it all bought--a
real handsome one. I don't believe Sam Vining can afford to buy a gold watch. I don't believe
it is all gold, for my part. They 'ain't got as much as we have, if Sam has had work steadier.
I don't believe it's gold. I don't want Ellen to have a watch at all unless it's a real good
one. It seems to me you'd better take a little money out and buy her one, Andrew."

"Well, I'll see," said Andrew. He had a terrible sense of guilt before Fanny. Suppose she knew
that there was no money at all in the bank to take out?

"Well, I'll buy her one if you say so," said he, in a curious, slow, stern voice. In his heart
was a fierce rising of rebellion, that he, hard-working and frugal and self-denying all his
life, should be denied the privilege of buying a present for his darling without resorting
to deception, and even almost robbery. He did not at that minute blame himself in the least
for his misadventure with his mining stock. Had not the same relentless Providence driven him
to that also? His weary spirit took for the first time a poise of utter self-righteousness
in opposition to this Providence, and he blasphemed in his inner closet of self, before the
face of the Lord, as he comprehended it.

"Well, I have a sort of set my heart on it," said Fanny.

"She shall have the watch," repeated Andrew, and his voice was fairly defiant.

After Fanny had gone into the house and lighted her lamp, and resumed work on her wrapper,
Andrew still sat on the step in the cool evening. There was a full moon, and great masses of
shadows seemed to float and hover and alight on the earth with a gigantic brooding as of birds.
The trees seemed redoubled in size from the soft indetermination of the moonlight which confused
shadow and light, and deceived the eye as with soft loomings out of false distances. There
was a tall pine, grown from a sapling since Ellen's childhood, and that looked more like a
column of mist than a tree, but the Norway spruces clove the air sharply like silhouettes in
ink, and outlined their dark profiles clearly against the silver radiance.

To Andrew, looking at it all, came the feeling of a traveller who passes all scenes whether
of joy or woe, being himself in his passing the one thing which remains, and somehow he got
from it an enormous comfort.

"We're all travellin' along," he said aloud, in a strained, solemn voice.

"What did you say, Andrew?" Fanny called from the open window.

"Nothin'," replied Andrew.

Chapter XVII

Ellen had always had objective points, as it were, in her life, and she always would have,
no matter how long she lived. She came to places where she stopped mentally, for retrospection
and forethought, wherefrom she could seem to obtain a view of that which lay behind, and of
the path which was set for her feet in advance. She saw the tracked and the trackless. Once,
going with Abby Atkins and Floretta in search of early spring flowers, Ellen had lingered and
let them go out of sight, and had sat down on a springing mat of wintergreen leaves under the
windy outstretch of a great pine, and had remained there quite deaf to shrill halloos. She
had sat there with eyes of inward scrutiny like an Eastern sage's, motionless as on a rock
of thought, while her daily life eddied around her. Ellen, sitting there, had said to herself:
"This I will always remember. No matter how long I live, where I am, and what happens to me,
I will always remember how I was a child, and sat here this morning in spring under the pine-tree,
looking backward and forward. I will never forget."

When, finally, Abby and Floretta had run back, and spied her there, they had stared half frightened.
"You ain't sick, are you, Ellen?" asked Abby, anxiously.

"What are you sitting there for?" asked Floretta.

Ellen had replied that she was not sick, and had risen and run on, looking for flowers, but
the flowers for her bloomed always against a background of the past, and nodded with forward
flings of fragrance into the future; for the other children, who were wholly of their own day
and generation, they bloomed in the simple light of their own desire of possession. They picked
only flowers, but Ellen picked thoughts, and they kept casting bewildered side-glances at her,
for the look which had come into her eyes as she sat beneath the pine-tree lingered.

It was as if a rose had a second of self-consciousness between the bud and the blossom; a bird
between its mother's brooding and the song. She had caught sight of the innermost processes
of things, of her wheels of life.

Ellen waked up on that June morning, and the old sensation of a pause before advance was upon
her, and the strange solemnity which was almost a terror, from the feeble clutching of her
mind at the comprehension of infinity. She looked at the morning sunlight coming between the
white slants of her curtains, an airy flutter of her new dress from the closet, her valedictory,
tied with a white satin ribbon, on the stand, and she saw quite plainly all which had led up
to this, and to her, Ellen Brewster; and she saw also the inevitableness of its passing, the
precious valedictory being laid away and buried beneath a pile of future ones; she saw the
crowd of future valedictorians advancing like a flock of white doves in their white gowns,
when hers was worn out, and its beauty gone, pressing forward, dimming her to her own vision.
She saw how she would come to look calmly and coldly upon all that filled her with such joy
and excitement to-day; how the savor of the moment would pass from her tongue, and she said
to herself that she would always remember this moment.

Then suddenly--since she had in herself an impetus of motion which nothing, not even reflection,
could long check--she saw quite plainly a light beyond, after all this should have passed,
and the leaping power of her spirit to gain it. And then, since she was healthy, and given
only at wide intervals to these Eastern lapses of consciousness from the present, she was back
in her day, and alive to all its importance as a part of time.

She felt the bounding elation of tossing on the crest of her wave of success, and the full
rainbow glory of it dazzled her eyes. She was first in her class, she was valedictorian, she
had a beautiful dress, she was young, she was first. It is a poor spirit, and one incapable
of courage in defeat, who feels not triumph in victory. Ellen was triumphant and confident.
She had faith in herself and the love and approbation of everybody.

When she was seated with her class on the stage in the city hall, where the graduating exercises
were held, she saw herself just as she looked, and it was with a satisfaction which had nothing
weakly in its vein, and smiled radiantly and innocently at herself as seen in this mirror of
love and appreciation of all who knew her.

When the band stopped playing, and Ellen, who as valedictorian came last as the crown and capsheaf
of it all, stepped forward from the semicircle of white-clad girls and seriously abashed boys,
there was a subdued murmur and then a hush all over the hall. Andrew and Fanny and the grandmother,
seated directly in front of the stage--for they had come early to secure good seats--heard
whispers of admiration on every side. It was admiration with no dissent--such jealous ears
as theirs could not be deceived. Fanny's face was blazing with the sweet shame of pride in
her child; Andrew was pale; the grandmother sat as if petrified, with a proud toss of her head.
They looked straight ahead; they dared not encounter each other's eyes, for they were more
self-conscious than Ellen. They felt the attention of the whole assembly upon them. Andrew
was conscious of feeling ill and faint. His own joy seemed to overwhelm him. He forgot his
stocks, he forgot his borrowed money, he forgot Lloyd's; he was perfectly happy at the sight
of that beautiful young creature of his own heart, who was preferred before all others in the
sight of the whole city. In truth, there was about Ellen a majesty and nobility of youth and
innocence and beauty which overawed. The other girls of the class were as young and as pretty,
but none of them had that indescribable quality which seemed to raise her above them all. Ellen
still kept her blond fairness, but there was nothing of the doll-like which often characterizes
the blond type. Although she was small, Ellen's color had the firmness and unwavering of tinted
marble; she carried her crown of yellow braids as if it had been gold; she moved and looked
and spoke with decision. The violent and intense temperament which she had inherited from two
sides of her family had crystallized in her to something more forcible, but also more impressive.
However, she was, after all, only a young girl, scarcely more than a child, whatever her principle
of underlying character might be, and when she stood there before them all--all her townspeople
who represented her world, the human shore upon which her own little individuality beat--when
she saw those attentive faces, row upon row, all fixed upon her, she felt her heart pound against
her side; she had no sensation of the roll of paper in her hand; an awful terror as of suddenly
discovered depths came over her, as the wild clapping of hands to which her appearance had
given rise died away. Ellen stood still, holding the valedictory as if it had been a stick.
A little wondering murmur began to be heard. Andrew felt as if he were dying. Fanny gripped
his arm hard. Mrs. Zelotes had the look of one about to spring. Ellen had the terrible sensation
which has in it a nightmare of inability to move, allied with the intensest consciousness.
She knew that she was to read her valedictory, she knew that she must raise that white-ribboned
roll and read, or else be disgraced forever, and yet she was powerless. But suddenly some compelling
glance seemed to arouse her from this lock of nerve and muscle; she raised her eyes, and Cynthia
Lennox, on the farther side of the hall, was gazing full at her with an indescribable gaze
of passion and help and command. Her own mother's look could not have influenced her. Ellen
raised her valedictory, bowed, and began to read. Andrew looked so pale that people nudged
one another to look at him. Mrs. Zelotes settled back, relaxing stiffly from her fierce attitude.
Fanny wiped her forehead with a cheap lace-bordered handkerchief. There was a stifled sob farther
back, that came from Eva Tenny, who sat back on account of a break across the shoulders in
the back of her silk dress. Amabel, anæmic and eager in a little, tawdry, cheap muslin frock,
sat beside her, with worshipful eyes on Ellen. "What ailed her?" she whispered, hitting her
mother with a sharp little elbow. "Hush up!" whispered Eva, angrily, surreptitiously wiping
her eyes. In front, directly in her line of vision, sat the woman of whom she was jealous--the
young widow, who had been Aggie Bemis, arrayed in a handsome India silk and a flower-laden
hat. Eva's hat was trimmed with a draggled feather and a bunch of roses which she had tried
to color with aniline dye. When she got home that night she tore the feather out of the hat
and flung it across the room. She wished to do it that afternoon every time she looked at the
other woman's roses against the smooth knot of her brown hair, and that repressed impulse,
with her alarm at Ellen's silence, had made her almost hysterical. When Ellen's clear young
voice rose and filled the hall she calmed herself. Ellen had not folded back her first page
with a flutter of the white satin ribbons before people began to sit straight and stare at
each other incredulously. The subject of the valedictory, as well as those of the other essays,
had been allotted, and Ellen's had been "Equality," and she had written a most revolutionary
valedictory. Ellen had written with a sort of poetic fire, and, crude as it all was, she might
have had the inspiration of a Shelley or a Chatterton as she stood there, raising her fearless
young front over the marshalling of her sentiments on the smooth sheets of foolscap. Her voice,
once started, rang out clear and full. She had hesitated at nothing, she flung all castes into
a common heap of equality with her strong young arms, and she set them all on one level of
the synagogue. She forced the employer and his employé to one bench of service in the grand
system of things; she gave the laborer, and the laborer only, the reward of labor. As Ellen
went on reading calmly, with the steadfastness of one promulgating principles, not the excitement
of one carried away by enthusiasm, she began to be interrupted by applause, but she read on,
never wavering, her clear voice overcoming everything. She was quite innocently throwing her
wordy bomb to the agitation of public sentiment. She had no thought of such an effect. She
was stating what she believed to be facts with her youthful dogmatism. She had no fear lest
the facts strike too hard. The school-master's face grew long with dismay; he sat pulling his
mustache in a fashion he had when disturbed. He glanced uneasily now and then at Mr. Lloyd,
and at another leading manufacturer who was present. The other manufacturer sat quite stolid
and unsmiling beside a fidgeting wife, who presently arose and swept out with a loud rustle
of silks. She looked back once and beckoned angrily to her husband, but he did not stir. He
was on the school-board. The school-master trembled when he saw that imperturbable face of
storing recollection before him. Mr. Lloyd leaned towards Lyman Risley, who sat beside him
and whispered and laughed. It was quite evident that he did not consider the flight of this
little fledgling in the face of things seriously. But even he, as Ellen's clearly delivered
sentiments grew more and more defined--almost anarchistic--became a little grave in spite of
the absurd incongruity between them and the girlish lips. Once he looked in some wonder at
the school-teacher as much as to say, "Why did you permit this?" and the young man pulled his
mustache harder.

When Ellen finished and made her bow, such a storm of applause arose as had never before been
heard at a high-school exhibition. The audience was for the most part composed of factory employés
and their families, as most of the graduates were of that class of the community. Many of them
were of foreign blood, people who had come to the country expecting the state of things advocated
in Ellen's valedictory, and had remained more or less sullen and dissenting at the non-fulfilment
of their expectation. One tall Swede, with a lurid flashing of blue eyes under a thick, blond
thatch, led the renewed charges of applause. Red spots came on his cheeks, gaunt with high
cheekbones; his cold Northern blood was up. He stood upreared against a background of the crowd
under the balcony; he stamped when the applause died low; then it swelled again and again like
great waves. The Swede brandished his long arms, he shouted, others echoed him. Even the women
hallooed in a frenzy of applause, they clapped their hands, they stood up in their seats. Only
a few sat silent and contemptuous through all the enthusiasm. Thomas Briggs, the manufacturer,
was one of them. He sat like a rock, his great, red, imperturbable face of dissent fixed straight
ahead. Mrs. Lloyd clapped wildly, on account of the girl who had read the valedictory. She
had slept through the greater part of it, for it was very warm, and the heat always made her
drowsy. She kept leaning towards Cynthia as she clapped, and asking in a loud whisper if she
wasn't sweet. Cynthia did not applaud, but her delicate face was pale with emotion. Lyman Risley,
beside her, was clapping energetically. "She may have a bomb somewhere concealed among those
ribbons and frills," he said to Lloyd when the applause was waxing loudest, and Lloyd laughed.

As for Ellen, when the storm of applause burst at her feet, she stood still for a moment bewildered.
Then she bowed again and turned to go, then the compelling uproar brought her back. She stood
there quite piteous in her confusion. This was too much triumph, and, moreover, she had not
the least idea of the true significance of it all. She was like a chemist who had brought together,
quite ignorantly and unwittingly, the two elements of an explosive. She thought that her valedictory
must have been well done, that they liked it, and that was all. She had no sooner finished
reading than the ushers began in the midst of the storm of applause to approach the stage with
her graduating presents. They were laden with great bouquets and baskets of flowers, with cards
conspicuously attached to most of them. Cynthia Lennox had sent a basket of roses. Ellen took
it on her arm, and wondered when she saw the name attached to the pink satin bow on the handle.
She did not look again towards Cynthia since the old impulse of concealment on her account
came over her. Ellen had great boxes of candy from her boy admirers, that being a favorite
token of young affection upon such occasions. She had a gift-book from her former school-teacher,
and a ninety-eight-cent gilded vase from Eva and Amabel, who had been saving money to buy it.
She heard a murmur of admiration when she had finally reached her seat, after the storm of
applause had at last subsided, and she unrolled the packages with trembling fingers.

"My, ain't that handsome!" said Floretta, pressing her muslin-clad shoulder against Ellen's.
"My, didn't they clap you, Ellen! What's that in that package?"

The package contained Ellen's new watch and chain. Floretta had already received hers, and
it lay in its case on her lap. Ellen looked at the package, not hearing in the least the Baptist
minister who had taken his place on the stage, and was delivering an address. She had felt
her aunt Eva's and Amabel's eager eyes on her when she unrolled the gaudy vase; now she felt
her father's and mother's. The small, daintily tied package was inscribed "Ellen Brewster,
from Father and Mother."

"Why don't you open it?" came in her ear from Floretta. Maria was leaning forward also, over
her lapful of carnations which John Sargent had presented to her.

"Why don't she open it?" she whispered to Floretta. They were all quite oblivious of the speaker,
who moved nervously back and forth in front of them, so screening them somewhat from the observation
of the audience. Still Ellen hesitated, looking at the little package and feeling her father's
and mother's eyes on her face.

Finally she untied the cord and took out the jeweller's case from the wrapping-paper. "My,
you've got one too, I bet!" whispered Floretta. Ellen opened the box, and gazed at her watch
and chain; then she glanced at her father and mother down in the audience, and the three loving
souls seemed to meet in an ineffable solitude in the midst of the crowd. All three faces were
pale--Ellen's began to quiver. She felt Floretta's shoulder warm through her thin sleeve against
hers.

"My! you've got one--I said so," she whispered. "It isn't chased as much as mine, but it's
real handsome. My, Ellen Brewster, you ain't going to cry before all these people!"

Ellen smiled against a sob, and she gave her head a defiant toss. Down in the audience Fanny
had her handkerchief to her eyes, and Andrew sat looking sternly at the speaker. Ellen said
to herself that she would not cry--she would not, but she sat gazing down at her flower-laden
lap and the presents. The golden disk under her fixed eyes waxed larger and larger, until it
seemed to fill her whole comprehension as with a golden light of a suffering, self-denying
love which was her best reward of life and labor on the earth.

Chapter XVIII

After the exhibition there was a dance. The Brewsters, even Mrs. Zelotes, remained to see the
last of Ellen's triumph. Mrs. Zelotes was firmly convinced that Ellen's appearance excelled
any one's in the hall. Not a girl swung past them in the dance but she eyed her white dress
scornfully, then her rosy face, and sniffed with high nostrils like an old war-horse. "Jest
look at that Vining girl's dress, coarse enough to strain through," she said to Fanny, leaning
across Andrew, who was sitting rapt, his very soul dancing with his daughter, his eyes never
leaving her one second, following her fair head and white flutter of muslin ruffles and ribbons
around the hall.

"Yes, that's so," assented Fanny, but not with her usual sharpness. A wistful softness and
sweetness was on her coarsely handsome face. Once she reached her hand over Andrew's and pressed
it, and blushed crimson as she did so. Andrew turned and smiled at her. All that annoyed Andrew
was that Ellen danced with Granville Joy often, and also with other boys. It disturbed him
a little, even while it delighted him, that she should dance at all, that she should have learned
to dance. Andrew had been brought up to look upon dancing as an amusement for Louds rather
than for Brewsters. It had not been in vogue among the aristocracy of this little New England
city when he was young.

Mrs. Zelotes watched Ellen dance with inward delight and outward disapproval. "I don't approve
of dancing, never did," she said to Andrew, but she was furious once when Ellen sat through
a dance. Towards the end of the evening she saw with sudden alertness Ellen dancing with a
new partner, a handsome young man, who carried himself with more assurance than the school-boys.
Mrs. Zelotes hit Andrew with her sharp elbow.

"Who's that dancing with her now?" she said.

"That's young Lloyd," answered Andrew. He flushed a little, and looked pleased.

"Norman Lloyd's nephew?" asked his mother, sharply.

"Yes, he's on here from St. Louis. He's goin' into business with his uncle," replied Andrew.
"Sargent was telling me about it yesterday. Young Lloyd came into the post-office while we
were there."  Fanny had been listening. Immediately she married Ellen to young Lloyd, and the
next moment she went to live in a grand new house built in a twinkling in a vacant lot next
to Norman Lloyd's residence, which was the wonder of the city. She reared this castle in Spain
with inconceivable swiftness, even while she was turning her head towards Eva on the other
side, and prodding her with an admonishing elbow as Mrs. Zelotes had prodded Andrew. "That's
Norman Lloyd's nephew dancing with her now," she said. Eva looked at her, smiling. Directly
the idea of Ellen's marriage with the young man with whom she was dancing established full
connections and ran through the line of Ellen's relatives as though an electric wire.

As for Ellen, dancing with this stranger, who had been introduced to her by the school-master,
she certainly had no thought of a possible marriage with him, but she had looked into his face
with a curious, ready leap of sympathy and understanding of this other soul which she met for
the first time. It seemed to her that she must have known him before, but she knew that she
had not. She began to reflect as they were whirling about the hall, she gazed at that secret
memory of hers, which she had treasured since her childhood, and discovered that what had seemed
familiar to her about the young man was the face of a familiar thought. Ever since Miss Cynthia
Lennox had told her about her nephew, the little boy who had owned and loved the doll, Ellen
had unconsciously held the thought of him in her mind. "You are Miss Cynthia Lennox's nephew,"
she said to young Lloyd.

"Yes," he replied. He nodded towards Cynthia, who was sitting on the opposite side from the
Brewsters, with the Norman Lloyds and Lyman Risley. "She used to be like a mother to me," he
said. "You know I lost my mother when I was a baby."

Ellen nodded at him with a look of pity of that marvellous scope which only a woman in whom
the maternal slumbers ready to awake can compass. Ellen, looking at the handsome face of the
young man, saw quite distinctly in it the face of the little motherless child, and all the
tender pity which she would have felt for that child was in her eyes.

"What a beautiful girl she is," thought the young man. He smiled at her admiringly, loving
her look at him, while not in the least understanding it. He had asked to be presented to Ellen
from curiosity. He had not been at the exhibition, and had heard the school-master and Risley
talking about the valedictory. "I didn't know that you taught anarchy in school, Mr. Harris,"
Risley had said. He laughed as he said it, but Harris had colored with an uneasy look at Norman
Lloyd, whose face wore an expression of amusement. "Perhaps I should have," he began, but Lloyd
interrupted him. "My dear fellow," he said, "you don't imagine that any man in his senses could
take seriously enough to be annoyed by it that child's effusion on her nice little roll of
foolscap tied with her pretty white satin ribbon?"

"She is just as sweet as she can be," said Mrs. Norman, "and I thought her composition was
real pretty. Didn't you, Cynthia?"

"Very," replied Cynthia.

"What your are worrying about it for, Edward, I don't see," said Mrs. Norman to the school-master.

"Well, I am glad if it struck you that way," said he, "but when I heard the applause from all
those factory people"--he lowered his voice, since a number were sitting near--"I didn't know,
but--"  He hesitated.

"That the spark that would fire the mine might be in that pretty little beribboned roll of
foolscap," said Risley, laughing. "Well, it was a very creditable production, and it was written
with the energy of conviction. The Czar and that little school-girl would not live long in
one country, if she goes on as she has begun."

It was then that young Lloyd, who had just come in, and was standing beside the school-master,
turned eagerly to him, and asked who the girl was, and begged him to present him.

"Perhaps he'll fall in love with her," said Mrs. Norman, directly, when the two men had gone
across the hall in quest of Ellen. Her husband laughed.

"You have not seen your aunt for a long time," Ellen said to young Lloyd, when they were sitting
out a dance after their waltz together.

"Not since--I--I came on--with my father when he died," he replied. Again Ellen looked at him
with that wonderful pity in her face, and again the young man thought he had never seen such
a girl.

"I think your aunt is beautiful," Ellen said, presently, gazing across at Cynthia.

"Yes, she must have been a beauty when she was young."

"I think she is now," said Ellen, quite fervently, for she was able to disabuse her mind of
associations and rely upon pure observation, and it was quite true that leaving out of the
question Cynthia's age and the memory of her face in stronger lights at closer view, she was
as beautiful from where they sat as some graceful statue. Only clear outlines showed at that
distance, and her soft hair, which was quite white, lay in heavy masses around the intense
repose of her face.

"Yes--s," admitted Robert, somewhat hesitatingly. "She used to think everything of me when
I was a little shaver," he said.

"Doesn't she now?"

"Oh yes, I suppose she does, but it is different now. I am grown up. A man doesn't need so
much done for him when he is grown up."

Then again he looked at Ellen with eyes of pleading which would have made of the older woman
what he remembered her to have been in his childhood, and hers answered again.

Robert did not say anything to her about the valedictory until just before the close of the
evening, when their last dance together was over.

"I am sorry I did not have a chance to hear your valedictory," he said. "I could not come early."

Ellen blushed and smiled, and made the conventional school-girl response. "Oh, you didn't miss
anything," said she.

"I am sure I did," said the young man, earnestly. Then he looked at her and hesitated a little.
"I wonder if you would be willing to lend it to me?" he said, then. "I would be very careful
of it, and would return it immediately as soon as I had read it. I should be so interested
in reading it."

"Certainly, if you wish," said Ellen, "but I am afraid you won't think it is good."

"Of course I shall. I have been hearing about it, how good it was, and how you broke up the
whole house."

Ellen blushed. "Oh, that was only because it was the valedictory. They always clap a good deal
for the valedictory."

"It was because it was you, you dear beauty," thought the young man, gazing at her, and the
impulse to take her in his arms and kiss that blush seized upon him. "I know they applauded
your valedictory because it was worthy of it," said he, and Ellen's eyes fell before his, and
the blush crept down over her throat, and up to the soft toss of hair on her temples. The two
were standing, and the man gazed at Ellen's pink arms and neck through the lace of her dress,
those incomparable curves of youthful bloom shared by a young girl and a rose; he gazed at
that noble, fair head bent not so much before him as before the mystery of life, of which a
perception had come to her through his eyes, and he said to himself that there never was such
a girl, and he also wondered if he saw aright, he being one who seldom entirely lost the grasp
of his own leash. Having the fancy and the heart of a young man, he was given like others of
his kind to looking at every new girl who attracted him in the light of a problem, the unknown
quantity being her possible interest for him, but he always worked it out calmly. He kept himself
out of his own shadow, when it came to the question of emotions, in something the same fashion
that his uncle Norman did. Now, looking at Ellen Brewster with the whole of his heart setting
towards her in obedience to that law which had brought him into being, he yet was saying quite
coolly and loudly in his own inner consciousness, "Wait, wait, wait! Wait until to-morrow,
see how you feel then. You have felt in much this way before. Wait! Perhaps you don't see it
as it is. Wait!"

He realized his own wisdom all the more clearly when Ellen led him to the settee where her
relatives sat guarding her graduation presents and her precious valedictory. She presented
him gracefully enough. Ellen knew nothing of society etiquette, she had never introduced such
a young gentleman as this to any one in her life, but her inborn dignity of character kept
her self-poise perfect. Still, when young Lloyd saw the mother coarsely perspiring and fairly
aggressive in her delight over her daughter, when poor Andrew hoped he saw him well, and Mrs.
Zelotes eyed him with sharp approbation, and Eva, conscious of her shabbiness, bowed with a
stiff toss of her head and sat back sullenly, and little Amabel surveyed him with uncanny wisdom
divided between himself and Ellen, he became conscious of a slight disappearance of his glamour.
He thanked Ellen most heartily for the privilege which she granted him, when she took the valedictory
from the heap of flowers, and took his leave with a bow which made Fanny nudge Andrew, almost
before the young man's back was turned.

Then she looked at Ellen, but she said nothing. A sudden impulse of delicacy prevented her.
There was something about this beloved daughter of hers which all at once seemed strange to
her. She began to associate her with the sacred mystery of life as she had never done. Then,
too, there was the more superficial association with one of another class which she held in
outward despite but inward awe.

Ellen gathered up her presents into her lap, and sat there a few minutes through the last dance,
which she had refused to Granville Joy, who went away with nervous alertness for another girl,
and nobody spoke to her.

When young Lloyd and Cynthia Lennox and the others left, as they did directly, Fanny murmured,
"They've gone," and they all knew what she meant. She was thinking--and so were they all, except
Ellen--that that was the reason, because he had to go, that he had not asked Ellen for the
last dance.

As for Ellen, she sat looking at her gold watch and chain, which she had taken out of the case.
Her face grew intensely sober, and she did not notice when young Lloyd left. All at once she
had reflected how her father had never owned a watch in his whole life, though he was a man,
but he had given one to her. She reflected how he had so little work, how shabby his clothes
were, how he must have gone without himself to buy this for her, and the girl had such a heart
of gold that it rose triumphantly loyal to its first loves and tendernesses, and her father's
old, worn face came between her and that of the young man who might become her lover.

Chapter XIX

The day after Ellen's graduation there might have been seen a touching little spectacle passing
along the main street of Rowe about ten o'clock in the fore-noon. It was touching because it
gave evidence of that human vanity common to all, which strives to perpetuate the few small,
good things that come into the hard lives of poor souls, and strives with such utter futility.
Ellen held up her fluffy skirts daintily, the wind caught her white ribbons and the loose locks
of her yellow hair under her white hat. She carried Cynthia Lennox's basket of roses on her
arm, and each of the others was laden with bouquets. Little Amabel clasped both slender arms
around a great sheaf of roses; the thorns pricked through her thin sleeves, but she did not
mind that, so upborne with the elation of the occasion was she. Her small, pale face gazed
over the mass of bloom with challenging of admiration from every one whom she met. She was
jealous lest any one should not look with full appreciation of Ellen.

Ellen was the one in the little procession who had not unmixed delight in it. She had a certain
shamefacedness about going through the streets in such a fashion. She avoided looking at the
people whom she met, and kept her head slightly bent and averted, instead of carrying it with
the proud directness which was her habit. She felt vaguely that this was the element of purely
personal vanity which degrades a triumph, and the weakness of delight and gloating in the faces
of her relatives irritated her. It was a sort of unveiling of love, and the girl was sensitive
enough to understand it. "Oh, mother, I don't want to have us all go through the street with
all these flowers, and me in my white dress," she had said. She had looked at her mother with
a shrinking in her eyes which was incomprehensible to the other coarser-natured woman.

"Nonsense," she had said. "Sometimes you have real silly notions, Ellen."  Fanny said it adoringly,
for even silliness in this girl was in a way worshipful to her. Ellen, with her heart still
softened almost to grief by the love shown her on the day before, had yielded, but she was
glad when they arrived at the photograph studio. She had particularly dreaded passing Lloyd's,
for the thought came to her that possibly young Mr. Lloyd might see her. She supposed that
he was likely to be in the office. When they passed the office-windows she looked the other
way, but before she was well past, her aunt Eva hit her violently and laughed loudly. Ellen
shrank, coloring a deep crimson. Then her mother also laughed, and even Amabel, shrilly, with
precocious recognition of the situation. Only Mrs. Zelotes stalked along in silent dignity.

"Don't laugh so loud, he'll hear you," said she, severely.

"It was that young man who was at the hall last night, and he was looking at you awful sharp,"
said little Amabel to Ellen, squeezing her warm arm, and sending out that shrill peal of laughter
again.

"Don't, dear," said Ellen. She felt humiliated, and the more so because she was ashamed of
being humiliated by her own mother and aunt. "Why should I be so sensitive to things in which
they see no harm?" she asked herself, reprovingly.

As for young Lloyd, he had, ever since he parted with the girl the night before, that sensation
of actual contact which survives separation, and had felt the light pressure of her hand in
his all night, and along with it that ineffable pain of longing which would draw the substance
of a dream to actuality and cannot. He saw her with her coarsely exultant relatives, the inevitable
blur of her environments, and felt himself not so much disillusioned as confirmed. He had been
constantly saying to himself, when the girl's face haunted his eyes, and her hand in his own,
that he was a fool, that he had felt so before, that he must have, that there was no sense
in it, that he was Robert Lloyd, and she a good girl, a beautiful girl, but a common sort of
girl, born of common people to a common lot. "Now," he said to himself, with a kind of bitter
exultation, "there, I told you so."  The inconceivable folly of that glance of the mother at
him, then at Ellen, and the meaning laughter, repelled him to the point of disgust. He turned
his back to the window and resumed his work, but, in spite of himself, the pathos of the picture
which he had seen began to force itself upon him, and he thought almost tenderly and forgivingly
that she, the girl, had not once looked his way. He even wondered, pityingly, if she had been
mortified and annoyed by her mother's behavior. A great anger on Ellen's behalf with her mother
seized upon him. How pretty she did look moving along in that little flower-laden procession,
he thought, how very pretty. All at once a desire for the photograph which would be taken seized
him, for he divined the photograph. However, he said to himself that he would send back the
valedictory which he had not yet read by post, with a polite note, and that would be the end.

But it was only the next evening that Robert Lloyd with the valedictory in hand got off the
trolley-car in front of the Brewster house. He had proved to himself that it was an act of
actual rudeness to return anything so precious and of so much importance to the owner by the
post, that he ought to call and deliver it in person. When he regained his equilibrium from
the quick sidewise leap from the car, and stood hesitating a little, as one will do before
a strange house, for he was not quite sure as to his bearings, he saw a white blur as of feminine
apparel in the front doorway. He advanced tentatively up the little path between two rows of
flowering bushes, and Ellen rose.

"Good-evening, Mr. Lloyd," she said, in a slightly tremulous voice.

"Oh, good-evening, Miss Brewster," he cried, quickly. "So I am right! I was not sure as to
the house."

"People generally tell by the cherry-trees in the yard," replied Ellen, taking refuge from
her timidity in the security of commonplace observation, as she had done the night before,
giving thereby both a sense of disappointment and elusiveness.

"Won't you walk in?" she added, with the prim politeness of a child who accosts a guest according
to rule and precept. Ellen had never, in fact, had a young man make a formal call upon her
before. She reflected now, both with relief and trepidation, that her mother was away, having
gone to her aunt Eva's. She had an instinct which she resented, that her mother and this young
man were on two parallels which could never meet. Her father was at home, seated in the south
door with John Sargent and Nahum Beals and Joe Atkins, but she never thought of such a thing
as her father's receiving a young man caller, though she would not have doubted so much his
assimilating with Robert Lloyd. She understood that the young man might look at her mother
with dissent, while she resented it, but with her father it was different.

The group of men at the south door were talking in loud, fervent voices which seemed to rise
and fall like waves. Nahum Beals's strained, nervous tones were paramount. "Mr. Beals is talking
about the labor question, and he gets quite excited," Ellen remarked, somewhat apologetically,
as she ushered young Lloyd into the parlor.

Lloyd laughed. "It sounds as if he were leading an army," he said.

"He is very much in earnest," said the girl.

She placed painstakingly for her guest the best chair, which was a spring rocker upholstered
with crush-plush. The little parlor was close and stuffy, and the kerosene-lamp, with the light
dimmed by a globe decorated with roses, heated the room still further. This lamp was Fanny's
pride. It had, in her eyes, the double glory of high art and cheapness. She was fond of pointing
at it, and inquiring, "How much do you think that cost?" and explaining with the air of one
who expects her truth to be questioned that it only cost forty-nine cents. This lamp was hideous,
the shape was aggressive, a discordant blare of brass, and the roses on the globe were blasphemous.
Somehow this lamp was the first thing which struck Lloyd on entering the room. He could not
take his eyes from it. As for Ellen, long acquaintance had dulled her eyes. She sat in the
full glare of this hideous lamp, and Lloyd considered that she was not so pretty as he had
thought last night. Still, she was undeniably very pretty. There was something in the curves
of her shoulders, in her pink-and-white cotton waist, that made one's fingers tingle, and heart
yearn, and there was an appealing look in her face which made him smile indulgently at her
as he might have done at a child. After all, it was probably not her fault about the lamp,
and lamps were a minor consideration, and he was finical, but suppose she liked it? Lloyd,
sitting there, began to speculate if it were possible for one's spiritual nature to be definitely
damaged by hideous lamps. Then he caught sight of a plate decorated with postage-stamps, with
a perforated edge through which ribbons were run, and he wondered if she possibly made that.

"They are undoubtedly perfectly moral people," he told his aunt Cynthia afterwards, "but I
wonder that they keep such an immoral plate."  However, that was before he fell in love with
Ellen, while he was struggling with himself in his desire to do so, and making all manner of
sport of himself by way of hindrance.

Ellen at that age could have had no possible conception of the sentiment with which the young
man viewed her environment. She was sensitive to spiritual discords which might arise from
meeting with another widely different nature, but when it came to material things, she was
at a loss. Then, too, she was pugnaciously loyal to the glories of the best parlor. She was
innocently glad that she had such a nice room into which to usher him. She felt that the marble-top
table, the plush lambrequin on the mantle-shelf, the gilded vases, the brass clock, the Nottingham
lace curtains, the olive-and-crimson furniture, the pictures in cheap gilt frames, the heavily
gilded wall-paper, and the throws of thin silk over the picture corners must prove to him the
standing of her family. She felt an ignoble satisfaction in it, for a certain measure of commonness
clung to the girl like a cobweb. She was as yet too young to bloom free of her environment,
her head was not yet over the barrier of her daily lot; her heart never would be, and that
was her glory. Young Lloyd handed her the roll of valedictory as soon as he entered.

"I am very much obliged to you for allowing me to read it," he said.

Ellen took it, blushing. Her heart sank a little. She thought to herself that he probably did
not like it. She looked at him proudly and timidly, like a child half holding, half withdrawing
its hand for a sweet. It suddenly came to her that she would rather this young man would praise
her valedictory than any one else, that if he had been present when she read it in the hall,
and she had seen him standing applauding, she could not have contained her triumph and pride.
She was not yet in love with him, but she began to feel that in his approbation lay the best
coin of her realm.

"It is very well written, Miss Brewster," said Robert, and she flushed with delight.

"Thank you," she said.

But the young man was looking at her as if he had something besides praise in mind, and she
gazed at him, shrinking a little as before a blow whose motion she felt in the air. However,
he laughed pleasantly when he spoke.

"Do you really believe that?" he asked.

"What?" she inquired, vaguely.

"Oh, all that you say in your essay. Do you really believe that all the property in the world
ought to be divided, that kings and peasants ought to share and share alike?"

She looked at him with round eyes. "Why, of course I do!" she said. "Don't you?"

Robert laughed. He had no mind to enter into an argument with this beautiful girl, nor even
to express himself forcibly on the opposite side.

"Well, there are a number of things to be considered," he said. "And do you really believe
that employer and employés should share alike?"

"Why not?" said she.

Her blue eyes flashed, she tossed her head. Robert smiled at her.

"Why not?" she repeated. "Don't the men earn the money?"

"Well, no, not exactly," said Robert. "There is the capital."

"The profit comes from the labor, not from the capital," said Ellen, quickly. "Doesn't it?"
she continued, with fervor, and yet there was a charming timidity, as before some authority.

"Possibly," replied Robert, guardedly; "but the question is how far we should go back before
we stop in searching for causes."

"How far back ought we to go?" asked Ellen, earnestly.

"I confess I don't know," said Robert, laughingly. "I have thought very little about it all."

"But you will have to, if you are to be the head of Lloyd's," Ellen said, with a severe accent,
with grave, blue eyes full on his face.

"Oh, I am not the head of Lloyd's yet," he answered, easily. "My uncle is far from his dotage.
Then, too, you know that I was never intended for a business man, but a lawyer, like my father,
if there had not been so little for my father's second wife and the children--"  He stopped
himself abruptly on the verge of a confidence. "I think I saw you on your way to the photographer
to-day," he said, and Ellen blushed, remembering her aunt Eva's violent nudge, and wondering
if he had noticed. She gave him a piteous glance.

"Yes," she said. "All the girls have their pictures taken in their graduating dresses with
their flowers."

"You looked to me as if the picture would be a great success," said Robert. He longed to ask
for one and yet did not, for a reason unexplained to himself. He knew that this innocent, unsophisticated
creature would see no reason on earth why he should not ask, and no reason why she should not
grant, and on that account he felt prohibited. That night, after he had gone, Ellen wondered
why he had not asked for one of her pictures, and felt anxious lest he should have seen the nudge.

"Well," she said to herself, "if he finds any fault with anything that my mother has done,
I don't want him to have one."

Robert stayed a long time. He kept thinking that he ought to go, and also that he was bored,
and yet he felt a singular unwillingness to leave, possibly because of his sense that the visit
was in a measure forbidden by prudence. The longer he remained, the prettier Ellen looked to
him. New beauties of line and color seemed to grow apparent in the soft glow from the hideous
lamp. There was a wonderful starry radiance in her eyes now and then, and when she turned her
head her eyeballs gleamed crimson and her hair seemed to toss into flame. When she spoke, he
was conscious of unknown depths of sweetness in her voice, and it was so with her smile and
her every motion. There was about the girl a mystery, not of darkness but of light, which seemed
to draw him on and on and on without volition. And yet she said nothing especially remarkable,
for Ellen was only a young girl, reared in a little provincial city in common environments.
She would have been a great genius had she more than begun to glimpse the breadth and freedom
of the outer world through her paling of life. She was too young and too unquestioning of what
she had learned from her early loves.

"Have you always lived here in Rowe?" asked Lloyd.

"Yes," said she. "I was born here, and I have lived here ever since."

"And you have never been away?"

"Only once. Once I went to Dragon Beach and stayed a fortnight with mother."  She said this
with a visible sense of its importance. Dragon Beach was some ten miles from Rowe, a cheap
seashore place, built up with flimsy summer cottages of factory hands. Andrew had hired one
for a fortnight once when Ellen was ailing, and it had been the event of a lifetime to the
family. They hereafter dated from the year "we went to Dragon Beach."

Lloyd looked with a quick impulse of compassionate tenderness at this child who had been away
from Rowe once to Dragon Beach. He had his own impressions of Dragon Beach and also of Rowe.

"I suppose you enjoyed that?" said he.

"Very much. The sea is beautiful."

So, after all, it was the sea which she had cared for at Dragon Beach, and not the clam-bakes
and merry-go-rounds and women in wrappers in the surf. Robert felt rebuked for thinking of
anything but the sea in his memory of Dragon Beach; there was a wonderful water-view there.

All the time they sat there in the parlor, the murmur of conversation at the south door continued,
and now and again over it swelled the fervid exhortations of Nahum Beals. Not a word could
be distinguished, but the meaning was beyond doubt. That voice was full of denunciation, of
frenzied appeal, of warning.

"Who is it?" asked Lloyd, after an unusually loud burst.

"Mr. Beals," replied Ellen, uneasily. She wished that he would not talk so loud.

"He sounds as if he were preaching fire and brimstone," said Robert.

"No, he is talking about the labor question," replied Ellen.

Then she looked confused, for she remembered that this young man's uncle was the head of Lloyd's,
that he himself would be the head of Lloyd's some day. All at once, along with another feeling
which seemed about to conquer her, came a resentment against this young man with his fine clothes
and his gentle manners. Two men passed the windows and one of them looked in, and when the
electric-light flashed on his face she saw Granville Joy, and the man with him was in his shirt-sleeves.
She saw those white shirt-sleeves swing into the darkness, and felt at once antagonized against
herself and against Robert, and yet she knew that she had never seen a man like him.

"I suppose he has settled it," said Robert.

"I don't know," replied Ellen.

"He sounds dangerous."

"Oh, no. He is a good man. He wouldn't hurt anybody. He has always talked that way. He used
to come here and talk when I was a child. It used to frighten me at first, but it doesn't now.
It is only the way that poor people are treated that frightens me."

Again Robert had a sensation of moving unobtrusively aside from a direct encounter. He looked
across the room and started at something which he espied for the first time.

"Pardon me," he said, rising, "but I am interested in dolls. I see you still keep your doll,
Miss Brewster."

Ellen sat stupefied. All at once it dawned upon her what might happen. In the corner of the
parlor sat her beloved doll, still beloved, though the mother and not the doll had outgrown
her first condition of love. The doll, in the identical dress in which she had come from Cynthia's
so many years ago, sat staring forth with the fixed radiance of her kind, seated stiffly in
a tiny rocking-chair, also one of the treasures of Ellen's childhood. It was a curious feature
for the best parlor, but Ellen had insisted upon it. "She isn't going to be put away up garret
because I have outgrown her," said she. "She's going to sit in the parlor as long as she lives.
Suppose I outgrew you, and put you up in the garret; you wouldn't like it, would you, mother?"

"You are a queer child," Fanny had said, laughing, but she had yielded.

When young Lloyd went close to examine the doll, Ellen's heart stood still. Suppose he should
recognize it? She tried to tell herself that it was impossible. Could any young man recognize
a doll after all those years? How much did a boy ever care for a doll, anyway? Not enough to
think of it twice after he had given it up. It was different with a girl. Her doll meant--God
only knew what her doll meant to her; perhaps it had a meaning of all humanity. But the boy,
what had he cared for the doll? He had gone away out West and left it.

But Lloyd remembered. He stared down at the doll a moment. Then he took her up gingerly in
her fluffy pink robes of an obsolete fashion. He held her at arm's length, and stared and stared.
Suddenly he parted the flaxen wig and examined a place on the head. Then he looked at Ellen.

"Why, it is my old doll," he cried, with a great laugh of wonder and incredulity. "Yes, it
is my old doll! How in the world did you come by my doll, Miss Brewster? Account for yourself.
Are you a child kidnapper?"

Ellen, who had risen and come forward, stood before him, absolutely still, and very pale.

"Yes, it is my doll," said Lloyd, with another laugh. "I will tell you how I know. Of course
I can tell her face. Dolls look a good deal alike, I suppose, but I tell you I loved this doll,
and I remember her face, and that little cast in her left eye, and that beautiful, serene smile;
but there's something besides. Once I burned her head with the red-hot end of the poker to
see if she would wake up. I always had a notion when I was a child that it was only a question
of violence to make her wake up and demonstrate some existence besides that eternal grin. So
I burned her, but it made no difference; but here is the mark now--see."

Ellen saw. She had often kissed it, but she made no reply. She was occupied with considerations
of the consequences.

"How did you come by her, if you don't mind telling?" said the young man again. "It is the
most curious thing for me to find my old doll sitting here. Of course Aunt Cynthia gave her
to you, but I didn't know that she was acquainted with you. I suppose she saw a pretty little
girl getting around without a doll after I had gone, and sent her, but--"

Suddenly between the young man's face and the girl's flashed a look of intelligence. Suddenly
Robert remembered all that he had heard of Ellen's childish escapade. He knew. He looked from
her to the doll, and back again. "Good Lord!" he said. Then he set the doll down in her little
chair all of a heap, and caught Ellen's hand, and shook it.

"You are a trump, that is what you are," he said; "a trump. So she--"  He shook his head, and
looked at Ellen, dazedly. She did not say a word, but looked at him with her lips closed tightly.

"It is better for you not to tell me anything," he said; "I don't want to know. I don't understand,
and I never want to, how it all happened, but I do understand that you are a trump. How old
were you?"  Robert's voice took on a tone of tenderness.

"Eight," replied Ellen, faintly.

"Only a baby," said the young man, "and you never told! I would like to know where there is
another baby who would do such a thing."  He caught her hand and shook it again. "She was like
a mother to me," he said, in a husky voice. "I think a good deal of her. I thank you."

Suddenly to the young man looking at the girl a conviction as of some subtle spiritual perfume
came; he had seen her beauty before, he had realized her charm, but this was something different.
A boundless approbation and approval which was infinitely more precious than admiration seized
him. Her character began to reveal itself, to come in contact with his own; he felt the warmth
of it through the veil of flesh. He felt a sense of reliance as upon an inexhaustibility of
goodness in another soul. He felt something which was more than love, being purely unselfish,
with as yet no desire of possession. "Here is a good, true woman," he said to himself. "Here
is a good, true woman, who has blossomed from a good, true child."  He saw a wonderful faithfulness
shining in her blue eyes, he saw truth itself on her lips, and could have gone down at the
feet of the little girl in the pink cotton frock. Going home he tried to laugh at himself,
but could not succeed. It is easy to shake off the clasp of a hand of flesh, but not the clasp
of another soul.

Ellen on her part was at once overwhelmed with delight and confusion. She felt the fervor of
admiration in the young man's attitude towards her, but she was painfully conscious of her
undeservingness. She had always felt guilty about her silence and disobedience towards her
parents, and as for any self-approbation for it, that had been the farthest from her thoughts.
She murmured something deprecatingly, but Lloyd cut her short.

"It's no use crying off," said he; "you are one girl in a thousand, and I thank you, I thank
you from the bottom of my heart. It might have made awful trouble. My aunt Lizzie told me what
a commotion there was over it."

"I ran away," said Ellen, anxiously. Suddenly it occurred to her he might think Cynthia worse
than she had been.

"Never mind," said Lloyd--"never mind. I know what you did. You held your blessed little tongue
to save somebody else, and let yourself be blamed."

The door which led into the sitting-room opened, and Andrew looked in.

He made a shy motion when he saw Lloyd; still, he came forward. His own callers had gone, and
he had heard voices in the parlor, and had feared Granville Joy was calling upon Ellen.

As he came forward, Ellen introduced him shyly. "This is Mr. Lloyd, father," she said. "Mr.
Lloyd, this is my father."  Then she added, "He came to bring back my valedictory."  She was
very awkward, but it was the charming awkwardness of a beautiful child. She looked exceedingly
childish standing beside her father, looking into his worn, embarrassed face.

Lloyd shook hands with Andrew, and said something about the valedictory, which he had enjoyed
reading.

"She wrote it all herself without a bit of help from the teacher," said Andrew, with wistful pride.

"It is remarkably well written," said Robert.

"You didn't hear it read at the hall?" said Andrew.

"No, I had not that good fortune."

"You ought to have heard them clap," said Andrew.

"Oh, father," murmured Ellen, but she looked innocently at her father as if she delighted in
his pride and pleasure without a personal consideration.

The front door opened. "That's your mother," said Andrew.

Fanny looked into the lighted parlor, and dodged back with a little giggle.

Ellen colored painfully. "It is Mr. Lloyd, mother," she said.

Then Fanny came forward and shook hands with Robert. Her face was flaming--she cast involuntary
glances at Andrew for confirmation of her opinion. She was openly and shamelessly triumphant,
and yet all at once Robert ceased to be repelled by it. Through his insight into the girl's
character, he had seemed to gain suddenly a clearer vision for the depths of human love and
pity which are beneath the coarse and the common. When Fanny stood beside her daughter and
looked at her, then at Robert, with the reflection of the beautiful young face in her eyes
of love, she became at once pathetic and sacred.

"It is all natural," he said to himself as he was going home.

Chapter XX

Robert Lloyd when he came to Rowe was confronted with one of the hardest tasks in the world,
that of adjustment to circumstances which had hitherto been out of his imagination. He had
not dreamed of a business life in connection with himself. Though he had always had a certain
admiration for his successful uncle, Norman Lloyd, yet he had always had along with the admiration
a recollection of the old tale of the birthright and the mess of pottage. He had expected to
follow the law, like his father, but when he had finished college, about two years after his
father's death, he had to face the unexpected. The stocks in which the greater part of the
elder Lloyd's money had been invested had depreciated; some of them were for the time being
quite worthless as far as income was concerned. There were two little children--girls--by his
father's second marriage, and there was not enough to support them and their mother and allow
Robert to continue his reading for the law. So he pursued, without the slightest hesitation,
but with bitter regret, the only course which he saw open before him. He wrote to his uncle
Norman, and was welcomed to a position in his factory with more warmth than he had ever seen
displayed by him. In fact, Norman Lloyd, who had no son of his own, saw with a quickening of
his pulses the handsome young fellow of his own race who had in a measure thrown himself upon
his protection. He had never shared his wife's longing for children as children, and had never
cared for Robert when a child; but now, when he was a man grown and bore his name, he appealed
to him.

Norman Lloyd was supposed to be heaping up riches, and wild stories of his wealth were told
in Rowe. He gave large sums to public benefactions, and never stinted his wife in her giving
within certain limits. "We won't talk any more about the interview. I'd like to forget it. I should
have called here yesterday, as I wired in answer to your telegram saying you were at the Carlton,
but being at my brother's place in Cumberland, I couldn't get back till----"

"Oh, I understand," Margot cut in. Then she laughed a sly little laugh. "I think I understand
too why you went to Cumberland. Now tell me. Confession's good for the soul. Didn't your brother
wire for you the minute he saw that announcement in The Morning Post,
day before yesterday?" He was at once placed in the same category by the workmen.

Robert Lloyd did not concern himself in the least as to what the employés in his uncle's factory
thought of him. Nothing was more completely out of his mind. He was conscious of standing on
a firm base of philanthropic principle, and if ever these men came directly under his control,
he was resolved to do his duty by them so far as in him lay.

Ellen, since her graduation, had been like an animal which circles about in its endeavors to
find its best and natural place of settlement.

"What shall I do next?" she had said to her mother. "Shall I go to work, or shall I try to
find a school somewhere in the fall, or shall I stay here, and help you with some work I can
do at home? I know father cannot afford to support me always at home."

"I guess he can afford to support his only daughter at home a little while after she has just
got out of school," Fanny had returned indignantly, with a keen pain at her heart.

Fanny mentioned this conversation to Andrew that night after Ellen had gone to bed.

"What do you think--Ellen was asking me this afternoon what she had better do!" said she.

"What she had better do?" repeated Andrew, vaguely. He looked shrinkingly at Fanny, who seemed
to him to have an accusing air, as if in some way he were to blame for something. And, indeed,
there were times when Fanny in those days did blame Andrew, but there was some excuse for her.
She blamed him when her own back was filling her very soul with the weariness of its ache as
she bent over the seams of those grinding wrappers, and when her heart was sore over doubt
of Ellen's future. At those times she acknowledged to herself that it seemed to her that Andrew
somehow might have gotten on better. She did not know how, but somehow. He had not had an expensive
family. "Why had he not succeeded?" she asked herself. So there was in her tone an unconscious
recrimination when she answered his question about Ellen.

"Yes--what she had better go to work at," said Fanny, dryly, her black eyes cold on her husband's
face.

Andrew turned so white that he frightened her. "Go to work!" said he. Then all at once he gave
an exceedingly loud and bitter groan. It betrayed all his pride in and ambition for his daughter
and his disgust and disappointment over himself. "Oh! my God, has it come to this," he groaned,
"that I cannot support my one child!"

Fanny laid down her work and looked at him. "Now, Andrew," said she, "there's no use in your
taking it after such a fashion as this. I told Ellen that it was all nonsense--that she could
stay at home and rest this summer."

"I guess, if she can't--" said Andrew. He dropped his gray head into his hands, and began to
sob dryly. Fanny, after staring at him a moment, tossed her work onto the floor, went over
to him, and drew his head to her shoulder.

"There, old man," said she, "ain't you ashamed of yourself? I told her there was no need for
her to worry at present. Don't do so, Andrew; you've done the best you could, and I know it,
if I stop to think, though I do seem sort of impatient sometimes. You've always worked hard
and done your best. It ain't your fault."

"I don't know whether it is or not," said Andrew, in a high, querulous voice like a woman's.
"It seems as if it must be somebody's fault. If it ain't my fault, whose is it? You can't blame
the Almighty."

"Maybe it ain't anybody's fault."

"It must be. All that goes wrong is somebody's fault. It can't be that it just happens--that
would be worse than the other. It is better to have a God that is cruel than one that don't
care, and it is better to be to blame yourself, and have it your fault, than His. Somehow,
I have been to blame, Fanny. I must have. It would have been enough sight better for you, Fanny,
if you'd married another man."

"I didn't want another man," replied Fanny, half angrily, half tenderly. "You make me all out
of patience, Andrew Brewster. What's the need of Ellen going to work right away? Maybe by-and-by
she can get an easy school. Then, we've got that money in the bank."

Andrew looked away from her with his face set. Fanny did not know yet about his withdrawal
of the money for the purpose of investing in mining-stocks. He never looked at her but the
guilty secret seemed to force itself between them like a wedge of ice.

"Then Grandma Brewster has got a little something," said Fanny.

"Only just enough for herself," said Andrew. Then he added, fiercely, "Mother can't be stinted
of her little comforts even for Ellen."

"I 'ain't never wanted to stint your mother of her comforts," Fanny retorted, angrily.

"She 'ain't got but a precious little, unless she spends her principal," said Andrew. "She
'ain't got more'n a hundred and fifty or so a year clear after her taxes and insurance are paid."

"I ain't saying anything," said Fanny. "But I do say you're dreadful foolish to take on so
when you've got so much to fall back on, and that money in the bank. Here you haven't had to
touch the interest for quite a while and it has been accumulating."

It was agreed between the two that Ellen must say nothing to her grandmother Brewster about
going to work.

"I believe the old lady would have a fit if she thought Ellen was going to work," said Fanny.
"She 'ain't never thought she ought to lift her finger."

So Ellen was charged on no account to say anything to her grandmother about the possible necessity
of her going to work.

"Your grandmother's awful proud," said Fanny, "and she's always thought you were too good to work."

"I don't think anybody is too good to work," replied Ellen, but she uttered the platitude with
a sort of mental reservation. In spite of herself, the attitude of worship in which she had
always seen all who belonged to her had spoiled her a little. She did look at herself with
a sort of compunction when she realized the fact that she might have to go to work in the shop
some time. School-teaching was different, but could she earn enough school-teaching? There
was a sturdy vein in the girl. All the time she pitied herself she blamed herself.

"You come of working-people, Ellen Brewster. Why are you any better than they? Why are your
hands any better than their hands, your brain than theirs? Why are you any better than the
other girls who have gone to work in the shops? Do you think you are any better than Abby Atkins?"

And still Ellen used to look at herself with a pitying conviction that she would be out of
place at a bench in the shoe-factory, that she would suffer a certain indignity by such a course.
The realization of a better birthright was strong upon her, although she chided herself for
it. And everybody abetted her in it. When she said once to Abby Atkins, whom she encountered
one day going home from the shop, that she wondered if she could get a job in her room in the
fall, Abby turned upon her fiercely.

"Good Lord, Ellen Brewster, you ain't going to work in a shoe-shop?" she said.

"I don't see why not as well as you," returned Ellen.

"Why not?" repeated the other girl. "Look at yourself, and look at us!"

As she spoke, Ellen saw projected upon her mental vision herself passing down the street with
the throng of factory operatives which her bodily eyes actually witnessed. She had come opposite
Lloyd's as the six o'clock whistle was blowing. She saw herself in her clean, light summer
frock, slight and dainty, with little hands like white flowers in the blue folds of her skirt,
with her fine, sensitive outlook of fair face, and her dainty carriage; and she saw others--those
girls and women in dingy skirts and bagging blouses, with coarse hair strained into hard knots
of exigency from patient, or sullen faces, according to their methods of bearing their lots;
all of them rank with the smell of leather, their coarse hands stained with it, swinging their
poor little worn bags which had held their dinners. There were not many foreigners among them,
except the Irish, most of whom had been born in this country, and a sprinkling of fair-haired,
ruddy Swedes and keen Polanders, who bore themselves better than the Americans, being not so
apparently at odds with the situation.

The factory employés in Rowe were a superior lot, men and women. Many of the men had put on
their worn coats when they emerged from the factory, and their little bags were supposed to
disguise the fact of their being dinner satchels. And yet there was a difference between Ellen
Brewster and the people among whom she walked, and she felt it with a sort of pride and indignation
with herself that it was so. 

Nevill Caird had too much tact to insist, though he was far from being convinced. He said that
his aunt, Lady MacGregor, would write Miss Ray a note asking her to lunch next day, and then
they would have the panther-christening.

Also by that time he would know, from his friend, how his help might best be given. But in
any case he hoped that Miss Ray would allow his car to drop her at the Hotel de la Kasbah,
which had no omnibus and therefore did not send to meet the boat.

Her luggage might go up with the rest, and be left at the hotel.

These offers Victoria accepted gratefully; and as Caird put her into
the fine yellow car, the handsome Arab who had been on the boat looked
at her with chastened curiosity as he passed.

He must have seen that she was with the Englishman who had talked to her on board the Charles
Quex, and that now there was another man, who seemed to be the owner
of the large automobile.

The Arab had a servant with him, who had travelled second class on the boat, a man much darker than
himself, plainly dressed, with a smaller turban bound by cheaper
cord; but he was very clean, and as dignified as his master.

Stephen scarcely noticed the two figures.

The fine-looking Arab had ceased to be of importance since he had
left the ship, and would see no more of Victoria Ray.

The chauffeur who drove Nevill's car was an Algerian who looked as
if he might have a dash of dark blood in his veins.

Beside him sat the Kabyle servant, who, in his picturesque embroidered clothes, with his jaunty
fez, appeared amusingly out of place in the smart automobile, which
struck the last note of modernity.

The chauffeur had a reckless, daring face, with the smile of a mischievous
boy; but he steered with caution and skill through the crowded streets
where open trams rushed by, filled to overflowing with white-veiled
Arab women of the lower classes, and French girls in large hats, who
sat crushed together on the same seats.

 Abby burst out in a passionate appeal, clutching Ellen's arm hard.

"Ellen, promise me you never will," she cried.

"Promise you what, Abby?"

"Oh, promise me you never will marry anybody like him. I know it's none of my business--I know
that is something that is none of anybody's business, no matter how much they think of anybody;
but I think more of you than any man ever will, I don't care who he is. I know I do, Ellen
Brewster. And don't you ever marry a man like Granville Joy, just an ordinary man who works
in the shop, and will never do anything but work in the shop. I know he's good, real good and
steady, and it ain't against him that he ain't rich and has to work for his living, but I tell
you, Ellen Brewster, you ain't the right sort to marry a man like that, and have a lot of children
to work in shops. No man, if he thinks anything of you, ought to ask you to; but all a man
thinks of is himself. Granville Joy, or any other man who wanted you, would take you and spoil
you, and think he'd done a smart thing."  Abby spoke with such intensity that it redeemed her
from coarseness. Ellen continued to look at her, and two red spots had come on her cheeks.

"I don't believe I'll ever get married at all," she said.

"If you've got to get married, you ought to marry somebody like young Mr. Lloyd," said Abby.

Then Ellen blushed, and pushed past her indignantly.

"Young Mr. Lloyd!" said she. "I don't want him, and he doesn't want me. I wish you wouldn't
talk so, Abby."

"He would want you if your were a rich girl, and your father was boss instead of a workman,"
said Abby.

Then she caught hold of Ellen's arm and pressed her own thin one in its dark-blue cotton sleeve
lovingly against it.

"You ain't mad with me, are you, Ellen?" she said, with that indescribable gentleness tempering
her fierceness of nature which gave her caresses the fascination of some little, untamed animal.
Ellen pressed her round young arm tenderly against the other.

"I think more of you than any man I know," said she, fervently. "I think more of you than anybody
except father and mother, Abby."

The two girls walked on with locked arms, and each was possessed with that wholly artless and
ignorant passion often seen between two young girls. Abby felt Ellen's warm round arm against
hers with a throbbing of rapture, and glanced at her fair face with adoration. She held her
in a sort of worship, she loved her so that she was fairly afraid of her. As for Ellen, Abby's
little, leather-stained, leather-scented figure, strung with passion like a bundle of electric
wire, pressing against her, seemed to inform her farthest thoughts.

"If I live longer than my father and mother, we'll live together, Abby," said she.

"And I'll work for you, Ellen," said Abby, rapturously.

"I guess you won't do all the work," said Ellen. She gazed tenderly into Abby's little, dark,
thin face. "You're all worn out with work now," said she, "and there you bought that beautiful
pin for me with your hard earnings."

"I wish it had been a great deal better," said Abby, fervently.

She had given Ellen a gold brooch for a graduating-gift, and had paid a week's wages for it,
and gone without her new dress, and stayed away from the graduation, but that last Ellen never
knew; Abby had told her that she was sick.

That evening Robert Lloyd and his aunt Cynthia Lennox called on the Brewsters. Ellen was under
the trees in the west yard when she heard a carriage stop in front of the house and saw the
sitting-room lamp travel through the front entry to the front door. She wondered indifferently
who it was. Carriages were not given to stopping at their house of an evening; then she reflected
that it might be some one to get her mother to do some sewing, and remained still.

It was a bright moonlight night; the whole yard was a lovely dapple of lights and shadows.
Ellen had a vivid perception of the beauty of it all, and also that unrest and yearning which
comes often to a young girl in moonlight. This beauty and strangeness of familiar scenes under
the silver glamour of the moon gave her, as it were, an assurance of other delights and beauties
of life besides those which she already knew, and along with the assurance came that wild yearning.
Ellen seemed to scent her honey of life, and at the same time the hunger for it leaped to her
consciousness. She had begun by thinking of what Abby had said to her that afternoon, and then
the train of thought led her on and on. She quite ignored all about the sordid ways and means
of existence, about toil and privation and children born to it. All at once the conviction
was strong upon her that love, and love alone, was the chief end and purpose of life, at once
its source and its result, the completion of its golden ring of glory. Her thought, started
in whatever direction, seemed to slide always into that one all-comprehending circle--she could
not get her imagination away from it. She began to realize that the mind of mortal man could
not get away from the law which produced it. She began to understand dimly, as one begins to
understand any great truth, that everything around her obeyed that unwritten fundamental law
of love, expressed it, sounded it, down to the leaves of the trees casting their flickering
shadows on the silver field of moonlight, and the long-drawn chorus of the insects of the summer
night. She thought of Abby and how much she loved her; then that love seemed the step which
gave her an impetus to another love. She began to remember Granville Joy, how he had kissed
her that night over the fence and twice since, how he had walked home with her from entertainments,
how he had looked at her. She saw the boy's face and his look as plain as if he stood before
her, and her heart leaped with a shock of pain which was joy.

Then she thought of Robert Lloyd, and his face came before her. Ellen had not thought as much
of Robert as he of her. For some two weeks after his call she had watched for him to come again;
she had put on a pretty dress and been particular about her hair, and had stayed at home expecting
him; then when he had not come, she had put him out of mind resolutely. When her mother and
aunt had joked her about him she had been sensitive and half angry. "You know it is nothing,
mother," she said; "he only came to bring back my valedictory. You know he wouldn't think of
me. He'll marry somebody like Maud Hemingway."  Maud Hemingway was the daughter of the leading
physician in Rowe, and regarded with a mixture of spite and admiration by daughters of the
factory operatives. Maud Hemingway was attending college, and rode a saddle-horse when home
on her vacations. She had been to Europe.

But that evening in the moonlight Ellen began thinking again of Robert Lloyd. His face came
before her as plainly as Granville Joy's. She had arrived at that stage when life began to
be as a picture-gallery of love. Through this and that face the goddess might look, and the
look was what she sought; as yet, the man was a minor quantity.

All at once it seemed to Ellen, looking at her mental picture of young Lloyd, that she could
see love in his face yet more plainly, more according to her conception of it, than in the
other. She began to build an air-castle which had no reference whatever to Robert's position,
and to his being the nephew of the richest factory-owner in Rowe, and so far as that went he
had not a whit the advantage of Granville Joy in her eyes. But Robert's face wore to her more
of the guise of that for which the night and the moonlight, and her youth, had made her long.
So she began innocently to imagine a meeting with him at a picnic which would be held some
time at Liberty Park. She imagined their walking side by side, through a lovely dapple of moonlight
like this, and saying things to each other. Then all at once the man of her dreams touched
her hand in a dream, and a faintness swept over her. Then suddenly, gathering shape out of
the indetermination of the shadows and the moonlight, came a man into the yard, and Ellen thought
with awe and delight that it was he; but instead Granville Joy stood before her, lifting his
hat above his soft shock of hair.

"Hullo!" he said.

"Good-evening," responded Ellen, and Granville Joy felt abashed. He lay awake half the night
reflecting that he should have greeted her with a "Good-evening" instead of "Hullo," as he
had been used to do in their school-days; that she was now a young lady, and that Mr. Lloyd
had accosted her differently. Ellen rose with a feeling of disappointment that Granville was
himself, which is the hardest greeting possible for a guest, involving the most subtle reproach
in the world--the reproach for a man's own individuality.

"Oh, don't get up, Ellen," the young man said, awkwardly. "Here--I'll sit down here on the
rock."  Then he flung himself down on the ledge of rock which cropped out like a bare rib of
the earth between the trees, and Ellen seated herself again in her chair.

"Beautiful night, ain't it?" said Granville.

Ellen noticed that Granville said "ain't" instead of "isn't," according to the fashion of his
own family, although he was recently graduated from the high-school. Ellen had separated herself,
although with no disparaging reflections, from the language of her family. She also noticed
that Granville presently said "wa'n't" instead of "wasn't."  "Hot yesterday, wa'n't it?" said he.

"Yes, it was very warm," replied Ellen. That "wa'n't" seemed to insert a tiny wedge between
them. She would have flown at any one who had found fault with her father and mother for saying
"wa'n't," but with this young man in her own rank and day it was different. It argued something
in him, or a lack of something. An indignation all out of proportion to the offence seized
her. It seemed to her that he had in this simple fashion outraged that which was infinitely
higher than he himself. He had not lived up to her thought of him, and fallen short by a little
slip in English which argued a slip in character. She wanted to reproach him sharply--to ask
him if he had ever been to school.

He noticed her manner was cool, and was as far as the antipodes from suspecting the cause.
He never knew that he said "ain't" and "wa'n't," and would die not knowing. All that he looked
at was the substance of thought behind the speech. And just then he was farther than ever from
thinking of it, for he was single-hearted with Ellen.

The boy crept nearer her on the rock with a shy, nestling motion; the moonlight shone full
on his handsome young face, giving it a stern quality. "Ellen, look at here," he said.

Then he stopped. Ellen waited, not dreaming what was to follow. She had never had a proposal;
then, too, he had just been chased out of her mental perspective by the other man.

"Look at here, Ellen," said Granville. He stopped again; then when he spoke his voice had an
indescribably solemn, beseeching quality. "Oh, Ellen," he said, reaching up and catching her
hand. He dragged himself nearer, leaned his cheek against her hand, which it seemed to burn;
then he began kissing it with soft, pouting lips.

Ellen tried to pull her hand away. "Let my hand go this minute, Granville Joy," she said, angrily.

The boy let her hand go immediately, and stood up, leaning over her.

"Don't be angry; I didn't mean any harm, Ellen," he whispered.

"I shall be angry if you do such a thing again," said Ellen. "We aren't children; you have
no right to do such a thing, and you know it."

"But I thought maybe you wouldn't mind, Ellen," said Granville. Then he added, with his voice
all husky with emotion and a kind of fear: "Ellen, you know how I feel about you. You know
how I have always felt."

Ellen made no reply. It seemed inconceivable that she for the minute should not know his meaning,
but she was bewildered.

"You know I've always counted on havin' you for my wife some day when we were both old enough,"
said the boy, "and I've gone to work now, and I hope to get bigger pay before long, and--"

Ellen rose with sudden realization. "Granville Joy," cried she, with something like panic in
her voice, "you must not! Oh, if I had known! I would not have let you finish. I would not,
Granville." She caught his arm, and clung to it, and looked up at him pitifully. "You know
I wouldn't have let you finish," she said. "Don't be hurt, Granville."

The boy looked at her as if she had struck him.

"Oh, Ellen," he groaned. "Oh, Ellen, I always thought you would!"

"I am not going to marry anybody," said Ellen. Her voice wavered in spite of herself; the young
man's look and voice were shaking her through weakness of her own nature which she did not
understand, but which might be mightier than her strength. Something crept into her tone which
emboldened the young man to seize her hand again. "You do, in spite of all you say--" he began;
but just then a long shadow fell athwart the moonlight, and Ellen snatched her hand away imperceptibly,
and young Lloyd stood before them.

Chapter XXI

Granville Joy was employed in Lloyd's, and Robert had seen him that very day and spoken to
him, but he did not recognize him, not until Ellen spoke. "This is Mr. Joy, Mr. Lloyd," she
said; "perhaps you know him. He works in your uncle's shop."  She said it quite simply, as
if it was a matter of course that Robert was on speaking terms with all the employés in his
uncle's factory.

Granville colored. "I saw Mr. Lloyd this afternoon in the cutting-room," he said, "and we had
some talk together; but maybe he don't remember, there are so many of us."  Granville said
"so many of us" with an indescribably bitter emphasis. Suddenly his gentleness seemed changed
to gall. It was the terrible protest of one of the herd who goes along with the rest, yet realizes
it, and looks ever out from his common mass with fierce eyes of individual dissent at the immutable
conditions of things. Immediately, when Granville saw the other young man, this gentleman in
his light summer clothes, who bore about him no stain nor odor of toil, he felt that here was
Ellen's mate; that he was left behind. He looked at him, not missing a detail of his superiority,
and he saw himself young and not ill-looking, but hopelessly common, clad in awkward clothes;
he smelled the smell of leather that steamed up in his face from his raiment and his body;
and he looked at Ellen, fair and white in her dainty muslin, and saw himself thrust aside,
as it were, by his own judgment as to the fitness of things, but with no less bitterness. When
he said "there are so many of us," he felt the impulse of revolution in his heart; that he
would have liked to lead the "many of us" against this young aristocrat. But Robert smiled,
though somewhat stiffly, and bowed. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Joy," he said; "I do remember,
but for a minute I did not."

"I don't wonder," said Granville, and again he repeated, "There are so many of us," in that
sullen, bitter tone. 

The principal façade was blank as a wall, save for a few small, mysterious windows, barred with
grilles of iron, green with age; but on the other façades were quaint recessed balconies,
under projecting roofs supported with beams of cedar; and the door, presently opened by an Arab servant,
was very old too, made of oak covered with an armour of greenish
copper.

Even when it had closed behind Stephen and Nevill, they were not yet in the house, but in a large
court with a ceiling of carved and painted cedar-wood supported by marble pillars of extreme lightness
and grace. In front, this court was open, looking on to an inner garden with a fountain more
delicate of design than those Stephen had seen outside. The three walls of the court were patterned
all over with ancient tiles rare as some faded Spanish brocade in
a cathedral, and along their length ran low seats where in old days
sat slaves awaiting orders from their master.

Out from this court they walked through a kind of pillared cloister,
and the façades of the house as they passed on, were beautiful in
pure simplicity of line; so white, they seemed to turn the sun on
them to moonlight; so jewelled with bands and plaques of lovely tiles,
that they were like snowy shoulders of a woman hung with necklaces
of precious stones.

By the time they had left this cloistered garden and threaded their
way indoors, Stephen had lost his bearings completely.

He was convinced that, once in, he should never find the clue which
would guide him out again as he had come.

There was another garden court, much larger than the first, and this,
Nevill said, had been the garden of the palace-women in days of old.

It had a fountain whose black marble basin was fringed with papyrus, and filled with pink, blue,
and white water lilies, from under whose flat dark pads glimmered the backs of darting goldfish.
Three walls of this garden had low doorways with cunningly carved doors of cedar-wood, and small,
iron-barred windows festooned with the biggest roses Stephen had
ever seen; but the fourth side was formed by an immense loggia with
a dais at the back, and an open-fronted room at either end.

Walls and floor of this loggia were tiled, and barred windows on either side the dais looked
far down over a world which seemed all sky, sea, and garden. One of the little open rooms was hung
with Persian prayer-rugs which Stephen thought were like fading rainbows seen through a mist; and
there were queer old tinselled pictures such as good Moslems love:
Borak, the steed of the prophet, half winged woman, half horse; the
Prophet's uncle engaged in mighty battle; the Prophet's favourite
daughter, Fatma-Zora, daintily eating her sacred breakfast.

The other room at the opposite end of the tiled loggia was fitted up, Moorish fashion, for the making
of coffee; walls and ceiling carved, gilded, and painted in brilliant colours; the floor tiled
with the charming "windmill" pattern; many shelves adorned with countless little coffee cups
in silver standards; with copper and brass utensils of all imaginable kinds; and in a gilded
recess was a curious apparatus for boiling water.

Nevill Caird displayed his treasures and the beauties of his domain
with an ingenuous pride, delighted at every word of appreciation,
stopping Stephen here and there to point out something of which he
was fond, explaining the value of certain old tiles from the point
of view of an expert, and gladly lingering to answer every question.

Some day, he said, he was going to write a book about tiles, a book
which should have wonderful illustrations.

"Do you really like it all?" he asked, as Stephen looked out from a barred window of the loggia,
over the wide view.

"I never even imagined anything so fantastically beautiful," Stephen returned warmly. "You ought
to be happy, even if you could never go outside your own house and gardens. There's nothing to
touch this on the Riviera. It's a palace of the 'Arabian Nights.'"

"There was a palace in the 'Arabian Nights,' if you remember," said Nevill, "where everything
was perfect except one thing. Its master was miserable because he couldn't get that thing."

"The Roc's egg, of Aladdin's palace," Stephen recalled. "Do you lack a Roc's egg for yours?"

"The equivalent," said Nevill. "The one thing which I want, and don't seem likely to get, though
I haven't quite given up hope. It's a woman. And she doesn't want me--or my palace. I'll tell
you about her some day--soon, perhaps. And maybe you'll see her. But never mind my troubles for
the moment. I can put them out of my mind with comparative ease, in the pleasure of welcoming
you. Now we'll go indoors. You haven't an idea what the house is like yet. By the way, I nearly
forgot this chap."

He put his hand into the pocket of his grey flannel coat, and pulled out a green frog, wrapped
in a lettuce leaf which was inadequate as a garment, but a perfect match as to colour.

"I bought him on the way down to meet you," Nevill explained.

"Saw an Arab kid trying to sell him in the street, poor little beast. Thought it would be a friendly
act to bring him here to join my happy family, which is large and varied. I don't remember
anybody living in this fountain who's likely to eat him, or be eaten
by him."

Down went the frog on the wide rim of the marble fountain, and sat there, meditatively, with a
dawning expression of contentment, so Stephen fancied, on his green face. He looked, Stephen thought,
as if he were trying to forget a troubled past, and as if his new home with all its unexplored
mysteries of reeds and lily pads were wondrously to his liking.

"I wish you'd name that person after me," said Stephen. "You're being very good to both of us,--taking
us out of Hades into Paradise."

"Come along in," was Nevill Caird's only answer. But he walked into the house with his hand
on Stephen's shoulder.

IX

Djenan El Djouad was a labyrinth. Stephen Knight abandoned all attempt at keeping a mental
clue before he had reached the drawing-room. Nevill led him there by way of many tile-paved
corridors, lit by hanging Arab lamps suspended from roofs of arabesqued cedar-wood. They went
up or down marble steps, into quaint little alcoved rooms furnished with nothing but divans and
low tables or dower chests crusted with Syrian mother-o'-pearl, on
into rooms where brocade-hung walls were covered with Arab musical
instruments of all kinds, or long-necked Moorish guns patterned with
silver, ivory and coral.

Here and there as they passed, were garden glimpses, between embroidered
curtains, looking through windows always barred with greenish wrought
iron, so old as to be rarely beautiful; and some small windows had
no curtains, but were thickly frilled outside with the violent crimson
of bougainvillæa, or fringed with tassels of wistaria, loop on loop
of amethysts.

High above these windows, which framed flowery pictures, were other
windows, little and jewelled, mere plaques of filigree workmanship,
fine as carved ivory or silver lace, and lined with coloured glass
of delicate tints--gold, lilac, and pale rose.

"Here's the drawing-room at last," said Nevill, "and here's my aunt."

"If you can call it a drawing-room," objected a gently complaining
voice.

"A filled-in court, where ghosts of murdered slaves come and moan, while you have your tea. How do
you do, Mr. Knight? I'm delighted you've taken pity on Nevill. He's never so happy as when he's showing
a new friend the house--except when he's obtained an old tile, or a new monster of some sort,
for his collection."

"In me, he kills two birds with one stone," said Stephen, smiling, as he shook the hand of a tiny
lady who looked rather like an elderly fairy disguised in a cap, that could have been born nowhere
except north of the Tweed.

She had delicate little features which had been made to fit a pretty
child, and had never grown up.

Her hair, of a reddish yellow, had faded to a yellowish white, which by a faint fillip of the
imagination could be made to seem golden in some lights. Her eyes were large and round, and
of a china-blue colour; her eyebrows so arched as to give her an expression of perpetual surprise,
her forehead full, her cheekbones high and pink, her small, pursed mouth of the kind which prefers
to hide a sense of humour, and then astonish people with it when they have ceased to believe
in its existence. If her complexion had not been netted all over with a lacework of infinitesimal
wrinkles, she would have looked like a little girl dressed up for
an old lady.

She had a ribbon of the MacGregor tartan on her cap, and an uncompromising cairngorm fastened
her fichu of valuable point lace. A figure more out of place than hers in an ancient Arab palace
of Algiers it would be impossible to conceive; yet it was a pleasant figure to see there, and
Stephen knew that he was going to like Nevill's Aunt Caroline, Lady
MacGregor.

"I wish you looked more of a monster than you do," said she, "because
you might frighten the ghosts.

We're eaten up with them, the way some folk in old houses are with
rats.

Nearly all of them slaves, too, so there's no variety, except that
some are female.

I've given you the room with the prettiest ghosts, but if you're
not the seventh son of a seventh son, you may not see or even hear
them."

"Does Nevill see or hear?" asked Stephen.

"As much as Aunt Caroline does, if the truth were known," answered her nephew. "Only she couldn't
be happy unless she had a grievance.

Here she wanted to choose an original and suitable one, so she hit upon ghosts--the ghosts
of slaves murdered by a cruel master."

"Hit upon them, indeed!" she echoed indignantly, making her knitting needles click, a movement
which displayed her pretty, miniature hands, half hidden in lace ruffles. "As if they hadn't
gone through enough, in flesh and blood, poor creatures!

Some of them may have been my countrymen, captured on the seas by
those horrid pirates."

"Who was the cruel master?" Stephen wanted to know, still smiling, because it was almost impossible
not to smile at Lady MacGregor.

"Not my brother James, I'm glad to say," she quickly replied. "It was about three hundred years before
his time.

And though he had some quite irritating tricks as a young man, murdering slaves wasn't one of
them.

To be sure, they tell strange tales of him here, as I make no doubt
Nevill has already mentioned, because he's immoral enough to be proud
of what he calls the romance.

I mean the story of the beautiful Arab lady, whom James is supposed to have stolen from her
rightful husband--that is, if an Arab can be rightful--and hidden
in this house far many a year, till at last she died, after the search
for her had long, long gone by."

"You're as proud of the romance as I am, or you wouldn't be at such pains to repeat it to everybody,
pretending to think I've already told it," said Nevill. "But I'm going to show Knight his quarters.
Pretty or plain, there are no ghosts here that will hurt him. And then we'll have lunch, for
which he's starving."

Stephen's quarters consisted of a bedroom (furnished in Tunisian style,
with an imposing four-poster of green and gold ornamented with a gilded,
sacred cow under a crown) and a sitting room gay with colourful decorations
imported from Morocco.

These rooms opened upon a wide covered balcony screened by a carved wooden lattice and from
the balcony Stephen could look over hills, near and far, dotted with white villas that lay like
resting gulls on the green wave of verdure which cascaded down to
join the blue waves of the sea.

Up from that far blueness drifted on the wind a murmurous sound like
Æolian harps, mingled with the tinkle of fairy mandolins in the fountain
of the court below.

At luncheon, in a dining-room that opened on to a white-walled garden
where only lilies of all kinds grew, to Stephen's amazement two Highlanders
in kilts stood behind his hostess's chair.

They were young, exactly alike, and of precisely the same height, six foot two at least. "No, you
are not dreaming them, Mr. Knight," announced Lady MacGregor, evidently
delighted with the admiring surprise in the look he bestowed upon
these images.

"And you're quite right. They are twins.

I may as well break it to you now, as I had to do to Nevill when
he invited me to come to Algiers and straighten out his housekeeping
accounts: they play Ruth to my Naomi.

Whither I go, they go also, even to the door of the bathroom, where
they carry my towels, for I have no other maid than they."

Stephen could not help glancing at the two giants, expecting to see
some involuntary quiver of eye or nostril answer electrically to this
frank revelation of their office; but their countenances (impossible
to think of as mere faces) remained expressionless as if carved in
stone.

Lady MacGregor took nothing from Mohammed and the other Kabyle servant
who waited on Nevill and Stephen.

Everything for her was handed to one of the Highlanders, who gravely
passed on the dish to their mistress.

If she refused a plat favoured by them, instead of carrying it away,
the giants in kilts silently but firmly pressed it upon her acceptance,
until in self-defence she seized some of the undesired food, and ate
it under their watchful eyes.

During the meal a sudden thunderstorm boiled up out of the sea: the sky became a vast brazen
bowl, and a strange, coppery twilight bleached the lilies in the
white garden to a supernatural pallor.

The room, with its embroidered Moorish hangings, darkened to a rich gloom; but Mohammed touched
a button on the wall, and all the quaint old Arab lamps that stood in corners, or hung suspended
from the cedar roof, flashed out cunningly concealed electric lights.

At the same moment, there began a great howling outside the door. Mohammed sprang to open it, and
in poured a wave of animals. Stephen hastily counted five dogs; a collie, a white deerhound, a
Dandy Dinmont, and a mother and child of unknown race, which he afterwards learned was Kabyle,
a breed beloved of mountain men and desert tent-dwellers. In front of the dogs bounded a small African
monkey, who leaped to the back of Nevill's chair, and behind them toddled with awkward grace a baby
panther, a mere ball of yellow silk.

"They don't like the thunder, poor dears," Nevill apologised. "That's why they howled, for they're
wonderfully polite people really.

They always come at the end of lunch. Aunt Caroline won't invite them to dinner, because then she
sometimes wears fluffy things about which she has a foolish vanity.

The collie is Angus's. The deerhound is Hamish's. The dandy is hers.

The two Kabyles are Mohammed's, and the flotsam and jetsam is mine. There's a great deal more
of it out of doors, but this is all that gets into the dining-room
except by accident.

And I expect you think we are a very queer family."

Stephen did think so, for never till now had he been a member of a household where each of the servants
was allowed to possess any animals he chose, and flood the house with them. But the queerer he thought
the family, the better he found himself liking it.

He felt a boy let out of school after weeks of disgrace and punishment, and, strangely enough,
this old Arab palace, in a city of North Africa seemed more like
home to him than his London flat had seemed of late.

When Lady MacGregor
rose and said she must write the note she had promised Nevill to send
Miss Ray, Stephen longed to kiss her. This form of worship not being
permitted, he tried to open the dining-room door for her to go out,
but Angus and Hamish glared upon him so superciliously that he retired
in their favour. But Abby seized her in two wiry little arms.

"I never did, I never did!" she cried. "Don't I know what you are made of, Ellen Brewster?
Don't you think I know? But after all, it might be better for you if you were worse. That was
all I meant."

Ellen, one afternoon, set out in her pretty challis, a white ground with long sprays of blue
flowers running over it, and a blue ribbon at her neck and waist, and her leghorn hat with
white ribbons, and a knot of forget-me-nots under the brim. She wore her one pair of nice gloves,
too, but those she did not put on until she reached the corner of the street where Cynthia
lived. Then she rubbed them on carefully, holding up her challis skirts under one arm.

Cynthia was at home, seated on the back veranda, in a rattan chair, with a book which she was
not reading. Ellen stood before her, in her cheap attire, which she wore with an air which
seemed to make it precious, such faith she had in it. Ellen regarded her coarse blue-flowered
challis with an innocent admiration which seemed almost able to glorify it into silk. Cynthia
took in at a glance the exceeding commonness of it all; she saw the hat, the like of which
could be seen in the milliners' windows at fabulously low prices; the foam of spurious lace
and the spray of wretched blue flowers made her shudder. "The poor child, she must have something
better than that," she thought, and insensibly she also thought that the girl must lose her
evident faith in the splendor of such attire; must change her standard of taste. She rose and
greeted Ellen sweetly, though somewhat reservedly. When the two were seated opposite each other,
Cynthia tried to talk pleasantly, but all the time with a sub-consciousness as one will have
of some deformity which must be ignored. The girl looked so common to her in this array that
she began to have a hopeless feeling of disgust about it all. Was it not manifestly unwise
to try to elevate a girl who took such evident satisfaction in a gown like that, in a hat like
that? Ellen wore her watch and chain ostentatiously. The watch was too large for a chatelaine,
but she had looped the heavy chain across her bosom, and pinned it with the brooch which Abby
Atkins had given her, so it hung suspended. Cynthia riveted her eyes helplessly upon that as
she talked.

"I hope you are having a pleasant vacation," said she, as she looked at the watch, and all
at once Ellen knew.

Ellen replied that she was having a very pleasant vacation, then she plunged at once into the
subject of her call, though with inward trembling.

"Miss Lennox," said she--and she followed the lines of a little speech which she had been rehearsing
to herself all the way there--"I am very grateful to you for what you propose doing for me.
It will make a difference to me during my whole life. I cannot begin to tell you how grateful
I am."

"I am very grateful to be allowed to do it," replied Cynthia, with her unfailing refrain of
gentle politeness, but a kindly glance was in her eyes. Something in the girl's tone touched
her. It was exceedingly earnest, with the simple earnestness of childhood. Moreover, Ellen
was regarding her with great, steadfast, serious eyes, like a baby's who shrinks and yet will
have her will of information.

"I wanted to say," Ellen continued--and her voice became insensibly hushed, and she cast a
glance around at the house and the leafy grounds, as if to be sure that no one was within hearing--"that
I should never under any circumstances have said anything regarding what happened so long ago.
That I never have and never should have, that I never thought of doing such a thing."

Then the elder woman's face flushed a burning red, and she knew at once what the girl had suspected.
"You might proclaim it on the house-tops if it would please you," she cried out, vehemently.
"If you think--if you think--"

"Oh, I do not!" cried Ellen, in an agony of pleading. "Indeed, I do not. It was only that--I--feared
lest you might think I would be mean enough to tell."

"I would have told, myself, long ago if there had been only myself to consider," said Cynthia,
still red with anger, and her voice strained. All at once she seemed to Ellen more like the
woman of her childhood. "Yes, I would," said she, hotly--"I will now."

"Oh, I beg you not!" cried Ellen.

"I will go with you this minute and tell your mother," Cynthia said, rising.

Ellen sprang up and moved towards her as if to push her back in her chair. "Oh, please don't!"
she cried. "Please don't. You don't know mother; and it would do no good. It was only because
I wondered if you could have thought I would tell, if I would be so mean."

"And you thought, perhaps, I was bribing you not to tell, with Vassar College," Cynthia said,
suddenly. "Well, you have suspected me of something which was undeserved."

"I am very sorry," Ellen said. "I did not suspect, really, but I do not know why you do this
for me."  She said the last with her steady eyes of interrogation on Cynthia's face.

"You know the reasons I have given."

"I do not think they were the only ones," Ellen replied, stoutly. "I do not think my valedictory
was so good as to warrant so much, and I do not think I am so smart as to warrant so much, either."

Cynthia laughed. She sat down again. "Well," she said, "you are not one to swallow praise greedily."
Then her tone changed. "I owe it to you to tell you why I wish to do this," she said, "and
I will. You are an honest girl, with yourself as well as with other people--too honest, perhaps,
and you deserve that I should be honest with you. I am not doing this for you in the least,
my dear."

Ellen stared at her.

"No, I am not," repeated Cynthia. "You are a very clever, smart girl, I am sure, and it will
be a nice thing for you to have a better education, and be able to take a higher place in the
world, but I am not doing it for you. When you were a little child I would have done everything,
given my life almost, for you, but I never care so much for children when they grow up. I am
not doing this for you, but for your mother."

"My mother?" said Ellen.

"Yes, your mother. I know what agony your mother must have been in, that time when I kept you,
and I want to atone in some way. I think this is a good way. I don't think you need to hesitate
about letting me do it. You also owe a little atonement to your mother. It was not right for
you to run away, in the first place."

"Yes, I was very naughty to run away," Ellen said, starting. She rose, and held out her hand.
"I hope you will forgive me," she said. "I am very grateful, and it will make my father and
mother happier than anything else could, but indeed I don't think--it is so long ago--that
there was any need--"

"I do, for the sake of my own distress over it," Cynthia said, shortly. "Suppose, now, we drop
the subject, my dear. There is a taint in the New England blood, and you have it, and you must
fight it. It is a suspicion of the motives of a good deed which will often poison all the good
effect from it. I don't know where the taint came from. Perhaps the Pilgrim Fathers', being
necessarily always on the watch for the savage behind his gifts, have affected their descendants.
Anyway, it is there. I suppose I have it."

"I am very sorry," said Ellen.

"I also am sorry," said Cynthia. "I did you a wrong, and your mother a wrong, years ago. I
wonder at myself now, but you don't know the temptation. You will never know how you looked
to me that night."

Cynthia's voice took on a tone of ineffable tenderness and yearning. Ellen saw again the old
expression in her face; suddenly she looked as before, young and beautiful, and full of a boundless
attraction. The girl's heart fairly leaped towards her with an impulse of affection. She could
in that minute have fallen at her feet, have followed her to the end of the world. A great
love and admiration which had gotten its full growth in a second under the magic of a look
and a tone shook her from head to foot. She went close to Cynthia, and leaned over her, putting
her round, young face down to the elder woman's. "Oh, I love you, I love you," whispered Ellen,
with a fervor which was strange to her.

But Cynthia only kissed her lightly on her cheek, and pushed her away softly. "Thank you, my
dear," she said. "I am glad you came and spoke to me frankly, and I am glad we have come to
an understanding."

Ellen, after she had taken her leave, was more in love than she had ever been in her life,
and with another woman. She thought of Cynthia with adoration; she dreamed about her; the feeling
of receiving a benefit from her hand became immeasurably sweet.

Chapter XXIII

Ellen, under the influence of that old fascination which Cynthia had exerted over her temporarily
in her childhood, and which had now assumed a new lease of life, would have loved to see her
every day, but along with the fascination came a great timidity and fear of presuming. She
felt instinctively that the fascination was an involuntary thing on Cynthia's part. She kept
repeating to herself what she had said, that she was not sending her to Vassar because she
loved her. Strangely enough, this did not make Ellen unhappy in the least, she was quite content
to do all the loving and adoring herself. She made a sort of divinity of the older woman, and
who expects a divinity to step down from her marble heights, and love and caress? Ellen began
to remember all Cynthia's ways and looks, as a scholar remembers with a view to imitation.
She became her disciple. She began to move like Cynthia, and to speak like her, though she
did not know it. Her imitation was totally unconscious; indeed, it was hardly to be called
imitation; it was rather the following out of the leading of that image of Cynthia which was
always present before her mind. Ellen saw Cynthia very seldom. Once or twice she arrayed herself
in her best and made a formal call of gratitude, and once Fanny went with her. Ellen saw the
incongruity of her mother in Cynthia's drawing-room with a torture which she never forgot.
Going home she clung hard to her mother's arm all the way. She was fairly fierce with love
and loyalty. She was so indignant with herself that she had seen the incongruity. "I think
our parlor is enough sight prettier than hers," she said, defiantly, when they reached home
and the hideous lamp was lighted. Ellen looked around the ornate room, and then at her mother,
as with a challenge in behalf of loyalty, and of that which underlies externals.

"I rather guess it is," agreed Fanny, happily, "and I don't s'pose it cost half so much. I
dare say that mat on her hearth cost as much as all our plush furniture and the carpet, and
it is a dreadful dull, homely thing."

"Yes, it is," said Ellen.

"I wish I'd been able to keep my hands as white as Miss Lennox's, an' I wish I'd had time to
speak so soft and slow," said Fanny, wistfully. Then Ellen had her by both shoulders, and was
actually shaking her with a passion to which she very seldom gave rein.

"Mother," she cried--"mother, you know better, you know there is nobody in the whole world
to me like my own mother, and never will be. It isn't being beautiful, nor speaking in a soft
voice, nor dressing well, it's the being you--you. You know I love you best, mother, you know,
and I love my own home best, and everything that is my own best, and I always will."  Ellen
was almost weeping.

"You silly child," said Fanny, tenderly. "Mother knows you love her best, but she wishes for
your sake, and especially since you are going to have advantages that she never had, that she
was a little different."

"I don't, I don't," said Ellen, fiercely. "I want you just as you are, just exactly as you
are, mother."

Fanny laughed tearfully, and rubbed her coarse black head against Ellen's lovingly with a curious,
cat-like motion, then bade her run away or she would not get her dress done. A dressmaker was
coming for a whole week to the Brewster house to make Ellen's outfit. Mrs. Zelotes had furnished
most of the materials, and Andrew was to pay the dressmaker. "You can take a little more of
that money out of the bank," Fanny said. "I want Ellen to go looking so she won't be ashamed
before the other girls, and I don't want Cynthia Lennox thinking she ain't well enough dressed,
and we ought to have let her do it. As for being beholden to her for Ellen's clothes, I won't."

"I rather guess not," said Andrew, but he was sick at heart. Only that afternoon the man from
whom he had borrowed the money to buy Ellen's watch and chain had asked him for it. He had
not a cent in advance for his weekly pay; he could not see where the money for Ellen's clothes
was coming from. It was long since the "Golden Hope" had been quoted in the stock-list, but
the next morning Andrew purchased a morning paper. He had stopped taking one regularly. He
put on his spectacles, and spread out the paper in his shaking hands, and scrutinized the stock-list
eagerly, but he could not find what he wanted. The "Golden Hope" had long since dropped to
a still level below all record of fluctuations. A young man passing to his place at the bench
looked over his shoulder. "Counting up your dividends, Brewster?" he asked, with a grin.

Andrew folded up the paper gloomily and made no reply.

"Irish dividends, maybe," said the man, with a chuckle at his own wit, and a backward roll
of a facetious eye.

"Oh, shut up, you're too smart to live," said the man who stood next at the bench. He was a
young fellow who had been a school-mate of Ellen in the grammar-school. He had left to go to
work when she had entered the high-school. His name was Dixon. He was wiry and alert, with
a restless sparkle of bright eyes in a grimy face, and he cut the leather with lightning-like
rapidity. Dixon had always thought Ellen the most beautiful girl in Rowe. He looked after Andrew
with a sharp pain of sympathy when he went away with the roll of newspaper sticking out of
his pocket.

"Poor old chap," he said to the facetious man, thrusting his face angrily towards him. "He
has had a devil of a time since he begun to grow old. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Wait till you begin to drop behind. It's what's bound to come to the whole boiling of us."

"Mind your jaw," said the first man, with a scowl.

"You'd better mind yours," said Dixon, slashing furiously at the leather.

That noon Dixon offered Andrew, shamefacedly, taking him aside lest the other men see, a piece
of pie of a superior sort which his mother had put into his dinner bag, but Andrew thanked
him kindly and refused it. He could eat nothing whatever that noon. He kept thinking about
the dressmaker, and how Fanny would ask him again to take some of that money out of the bank
to pay her, and how the money was already taken out.

That evening, when he sat down to the tea-table furnished with the best china and frosted cake
in honor of the dressmaker, and heard the radiant talk about Ellen's new frills and tucks,
he had a cold feeling at his heart. He was ashamed to look at the dressmaker.

"You won't know your daughter when we get her fixed up for Vassar," she told Andrew, with a
smirk which covered her face with a network of wrinkles under her blond fluff of hair.

"Do have some more cake, Miss Higgins," said Fanny. She was radiant. The image of her daughter
in her new gowns had gone far to recompense her for all her disappointments in life, and they
had not been few. "What, after all, did it matter?" she asked herself, "if a woman was growing
old, if she had to work hard, if she did not know where the next dollar was coming from, if
all the direct personal savor was fast passing out of existence, when one had a daughter who
looked like that?"  Ellen, in a new blue dress, was ravishing. The mother looked at her when
she was trying it on, with the possession of love, and the dressmaker as if she herself had
created her.

After supper Ellen had to try on the dress again for her father, and turn about slowly that
he might see all its fine points.

"There, what do you think of that, Andrew?" asked Fanny, triumphantly.

"Ain't she a lady?" asked the dressmaker.

"It is very pretty," said Andrew, smiling with gloomy eyes. Then he heaved a great sigh, and
went out of the south door to the steps. "Your father is tired to-night," Fanny said to Ellen
with a meaning of excuse for the dressmaker.

The dressmaker reflected shrewdly on Andrew's sigh when she was on her way home. "Men don't
sigh that way unless there's money to pay," she thought. "I don't believe but he has been speculating."
Then she wondered if there was any doubt about her getting her pay, and concluded that she
would ask for it from day to day to make sure.

So the next night after tea she asked, with one of her smirks of amiability, if it would be
convenient for Mrs. Brewster to pay her that night. "I wouldn't ask for it until the end of
the week," said she, "but I have a bill to pay."  She said "bill" with a murmur which carried
conviction of its deception. Fanny flushed angrily. "Of course," said she, "Mr. Brewster can
pay you just as well every night if you need it."  Fanny emphasized the "need" maliciously.
Then she turned to Andrew. "Andrew," said she, "Miss Higgins needs the money, if you can pay
her for yesterday and to-day."

Andrew turned pale. "Yes, of course," he stammered. "How much?"

"Six dollars," said Fanny, and in her tone was unmistakable meaning of the dearness of the
price. The dressmaker was flushed, but her thin mouth was set hard. It was as much as to say,
"Well, I don't care so long as I get my money."  She was unmarried, and her lonely condition
had worked up her spirit into a strong attitude of defiance against all masculine odds. She
had once considered men from a matrimonial point of view. She had wondered if this one and
that one wanted to marry her. Now she was past that, and considered with equal sharpness if
this one or that one wanted to cheat her. She had missed men's love through some failing either
of theirs or hers. She did not know which, but she was determined that she would not lose money.
So she bore Fanny's insulting emphasis with rigidity, and waited for her pay.

Andrew pulled out his old pocket-book, and counted the bills. Miss Higgins saw that he took
every bill in it, unless there were some in another compartment, and of that she could not
be quite sure. But Andrew knew. He would not have another penny until the next week when he
received his pay. In the meantime there was a bill due at the grocery store, and one at the
market, and there was the debt for Ellen's watch. However, he felt as if he would rather owe
every man in Rowe than this one small, sharp woman. He felt the scorn lurking within her like
a sting. She seemed to him like some venomous insect. He went out to the doorstep again, and
wondered if she would want her pay the next night when she went home.

Chapter XXIV

Ellen had a flower-garden behind the house, and a row of sweet-peas which was her pride. It
had occurred to her that she might venture, although Cynthia Lennox had her great garden and
conservatories, to carry her a bunch of these sweet-peas. She had asked her mother what she
thought about it. "Why, of course, carry her some if you want to," said Fanny. "I don't see
why you shouldn't. I dare say she's got sweet-peas, but yours are uncommon handsome, and, anyway,
it ought to please her to have some given her. It ain't altogether what's given, it's the giving."

So Ellen had cut a great bouquet of the delicate flowers, selecting the shades carefully, and
set forth. She was as guiltily conscious as a lover that she was making an excuse to see Miss
Lennox. She hurried along in delight and trepidation, her great bouquet shedding a penetrating
fragrance around her, her face gleaming white out of the dusk. She had to pass Granville Joy's
house on her way, and saw with some dismay, as she drew near, a figure leaning over the gate.

He pushed open the gate when she drew near, and stood waiting.

"Good-evening, Ellen," he said. He was mindful not to say "Hullo" again. He bowed with a piteous
imitation of Robert Lloyd, but Ellen did not notice it.

"Good-evening," she returned, rather stiffly, then she added, in a very gentle voice, to make
amends, that it was a beautiful night.

The young man cast an appreciative glance at the crescent moon in the jewel-like blue overhead,
and at the soft shadows of the trees.

"Yes, beautiful," he replied, with a sort of gratitude, as if the girl had praised him instead
of the night.

"May I walk along with you?" he asked, falling into step with her.

"I am going to take these sweet-peas to Miss Lennox," said Ellen, without replying directly.

She was in terror lest Granville should renew his appeal of a few weeks before, and she was
in terror of her own pity for him, and also of that mysterious impulse and longing which sometimes
seized her to her own wonder and discomfiture. Sometimes, in thinking of Granville Joy, and
his avowal of love, and the touch of his hand on hers, and his lips on hers, she felt, although
she knew she did not love him, a softening of her heart and a quickening of her pulse which
made her wonder as to her next movement, if it might be something which she had not planned.
And always, after thinking of Granville, she thought of Robert Lloyd; some mysterious sequence
seemed to be established between the two in the girl's mind, though she was not in love with
either.

Ellen was just at that period almost helpless before the demands of her own nature. No great
stress in her life had occurred to awaken her to a stanchness either of resistance or yielding.
She was in the full current of her own emotions, which, added to a goodly flood inherited from
the repressed passion of New England ancestors, had a strong pull upon her feet. Sooner or
later she would be given that hard shake of life which precipitates and organizes in all strong
natures, but just now she was in a ferment. She walked along under the crescent moon, with
the young man at her side whose every thought and imagination was dwelling upon her with love.
She was conscious of a tendency of her own imagination in his direction, or rather in the direction
of the love and passion which he represented, and all the time her heart was filled with the
ideal image of another woman. She was prostrated with that hero-worship which belongs to young
and virgin souls, and yet she felt the drawing of that other admiration which is more earthly
and more fascinating, as it shows the jewel tints in one's own soul as well as in the other.

As for Granville Joy, who had scrubbed his hands and face well with scented soap to take away
the odor of the leather, and put on a clean shirt and collar, being always prepared for the
possibility of meeting this dainty young girl whom he loved, he walked along by her side, casting,
from time to time, glances which were pure admiration at the face over the great bunch of sweet-peas.

"Don't you want me to carry them for you?" he asked.

"No, thank you," replied Ellen. "They are nothing to carry."

"They're real pretty flowers," said Granville, timidly.

"Yes, I think they are."

"Mother planted some, but hers didn't come up. Mother has got some beautiful nasturtiums. Perhaps
you would like some," he said, eagerly.

"No, thank you, I have some myself," Ellen said, rather coldly. "I'm just as much obliged to you."

Granville quivered a little and shrank as a dog might under a blow. He saw this dainty girl-shape
floating along at his side in a flutter of wonderful draperies, one hand holding up her skirts
with maddening revelations of whiteness. If a lily could hold up her petals out of the dust
she might do it in the same fashion as Ellen held her skirts, with no coarse clutching nor
crumpling, not immodestly, but rather with disclosures of modesty itself. Ellen's wonderful
daintiness was one of her chief charms. There was an immaculateness about her attire and her
every motion which seemed to extend to her very soul, and hedged her about with the lure of
unapproachableness. It was more that than her beauty which roused the imagination and quickened
the pulses of a young man regarding her.

Granville Joy did not feel the earth beneath his feet as he walked with Ellen. The scent of
the sweet-peas came in his face, he heard the soft rustle of Ellen's skirts and his own heart-beats.
She was very silent, since she did not wish him to go with her, though she was all the time
reproaching herself for it. Granville kept casting about for something to say which should
ingratiate him with her. He was resolved to say nothing of love to her.

"It is a beautiful night," he said.

"Yes, it is," agreed Ellen, and she looked at the moon. She felt the boy's burning, timid,
worshipful eyes on her face. She trembled, and yet she was angry and annoyed. She felt in an
undefined fashion that she herself was the summer night and the flowers and the crescent moon,
and all that was fair and beautiful in the whole world to this other soul, and shame seized
her instead of pride. He seemed to force her to a sight of her own pettiness, as is always
the case when love is not fully returned. She made an impatient motion with the shoulder next
Granville, and walked faster.

"You said you were going to Miss Lennox's," he remarked, anxiously, feeling that in some way
he had displeased her.

"Yes, to carry her some sweet-peas."

"She must have been real good-looking when she was young," Granville said, injudiciously.

"When she was young," retorted Ellen, angrily. "She is beautiful now. There is not another
woman in Rowe as beautiful as she is."

"Well, she is good-looking enough," agreed Granville, with unreasoning jealousy. He had not
heard of Ellen's good fortune. His mother had not told him. She was a tenderly sentimental
woman, and had always had her fancies with regard to her son and Ellen Brewster. When she heard
the news she reflected that it would perhaps remove the girl from her boy immeasurably, that
he would be pained, so she said nothing. Every night when he came home she had watched his
face to see if he had heard.

Now Ellen told him. "You know what Miss Cynthia Lennox is going to do for me," she said, abruptly,
almost boastfully, she was so eager in her partisanship of Cynthia.

Granville looked at her blankly. They were coming into the crowded, brilliantly lighted main
street of the city, and their two faces were quite plain to each other's eyes.

"No, I don't," said he. "What is it, Ellen?"

"She is going to send me to Vassar College."

Granville's face whitened perceptibly. There was a queer sound in his throat.

"To Vassar College!" he repeated.

"Yes, to Vassar College. Then I shall be able to get a good school, and teach, and help father
and mother."

Granville continued to look at her, and suddenly an intense pity sprang into life in the girl's
heart. She felt as if she were looking at some poor little child, instead of a stalwart young man.

"Don't look so, Granville," she said, softly.

"Of course I am glad at any good fortune which can come to you, Ellen," Granville said then,
huskily. His lips quivered a little, but his eyes on her face were brave and faithful. Suddenly
Ellen seemed to see in this young man a counterpart of her own father. Granville had a fine,
high forehead and contemplative outlook. He had been a good scholar. Many said that it was
a pity he had to leave school and go to work. It had been the same with her father. Andrew
had always looked immeasurably above his labor. She seemed to see Granville Joy in the future
just such a man, a finer animal harnessed to the task of a lower, and harnessed in part by
his own loving faithfulness towards others. Ellen had often reflected that, if it hadn't been
for her and her mother, her father would not have been obliged to work so hard. Now in Granville
she saw another man whom love would hold to the ploughshare. A great impulse of loyalty as
towards her own came over her.

"It won't make any difference between me and my old friends if I do go to Vassar College,"
she said, without reflecting on the dangerous encouragement of it.

"You can't get into another track of life without its making a difference," returned Granville,
soberly. "But I am glad. God knows I'm glad, Ellen. I dare say it is better for you than if--"
He stopped then and seemed all at once to see projected on his mirror of the future this dainty,
exquisite girl, with her fine intellect, dragging about a poor house, with wailing children
in arm and at heel, and suddenly a great courage of renunciation came over him.

"It is better, Ellen," he said, in a loud voice, like a hero's, as if he were cheering his
own better impulses on to victory over his own passions. "It is better for a girl like you,
than to--"

Ellen knew that he meant to say, "to marry a fellow like me."  Ellen looked at him, the sturdy
backward fling of his head and shoulders, and the honest regard of his pained yet unflinching
eyes, and a great weakness of natural longing for that which she was even now deprecating nearly
overswept her. She was nearer loving him that moment than ever before. She realized something
in him which could command love--the renunciation of love for love's sake.

"I shall never forget my old friends, whatever happens," she said, in a trembling voice, and
it might have all been different had they not then arrived at Cynthia Lennox's.

"Shall I wait and go home with you, Ellen?" Granville asked, timidly.

"No, thank you. I don't know how long I shall stay," Ellen replied. "You are real kind, but
I am not a bit afraid."

"It is sort of lonesome going past the shops."

"I can take a car," Ellen said. She extended her hand to Granville, and he grasped it firmly.

"Good-night, Ellen; I am always glad of any good fortune that may come to you," he said.

But Granville Joy, going alone down the brilliant street, past the blaze of the shop-windows
and the knots of loungers on the corners, reflected that he had seen the fiery tip of a cigar
on the Lennox veranda, that it might be possible that young Lloyd was there, since Miss Lennox
was his aunt, and that possibly the aunt's sending Ellen to Vassar might bring about something
in that quarter which would not otherwise have happened, and he writhed at the fancy of that
sort of good fortune for Ellen, but held his mind to it resolutely as to some terrible but
necessary grindstone for the refinement of spirit. "It would be a heap better for her," he
said to himself, quite loud, and two men whom he was passing looked at him curiously. "Drunk,"
said one to the other.

When he was on his homeward way he overtook a slender girl struggling along with a kerosene-can
in one hand and a package of sugar in the other, and, seeing that it was Abby Atkins, he possessed
himself of both. She only laughed and did not start. Abby Atkins was not of the jumping or
screaming kind, her nerves were so finely balanced that they recovered their equilibrium, after
surprises, before she had time for manifestations. There was a curious healthfulness about
the slender, wiry little creature who was overworked and under-fed, a healthfulness which seemed
to result from the action of the mind upon a meagre body.

"Hullo, Granville Joy!" she said, in her good-comrade fashion, and the two went on together.
Presently Abby looked up in his face.

"Know about Ellen?" said she. Granville nodded.

"Well, I'm glad of it, aren't you?" Abby said, in a challenging tone.

"Yes, I am," replied Granville, meeting her look firmly.

Suddenly he felt Abby's little, meagre, bony hand close over the back of his, holding the kerosene-can.
"You're a good fellow, Granville Joy," said she.

Granville marched on and made no response. He felt his throat fill with sobs, and swallowed
convulsively. Along with this womanly compassion came a compassion for himself, so hurt on
his little field of battle. He saw his own wounds as one might see a stranger's.

"Think of Ellen dogging around to a shoe-shop like me and the other girls," said Abby, "and
think of her draggin' around with half a dozen children and no money. Thank the Lord she's
lifted out of it. It ain't you nor me that ought to grudge her fortune to her, nor wish her
where she might have been otherwise."

"That's so," said the young man.

Abby's hand tightened over the one on the kerosene-can. "You are a good fellow, Granville Joy,"
she said again.

Chapter XXV

Robert Lloyd was sitting on the veranda behind the green trail of vines when Ellen came up
the walk. He never forgot the girl's face looking over her bunch of sweet-peas. There was in
it something indescribably youthful and innocent, almost angelic. The light from the window
made her hair toss into gold; her blue eyes sought Cynthia with the singleness of blue stars.
It was evident whom she had come to see. She held out her flowers towards her with a gesture
at once humble and worshipful, like that of some devotee at a shrine.

She said "Good-evening" with a shy comprehensiveness, then, to Cynthia, like a child, "I thought
maybe you would like some of my sweet-peas."

Both gentlemen rose, and Risley looked curiously from the young girl to Cynthia, then placed
his chair for her, smiling kindly.

"The sweet-peas are lovely," Cynthia said. "Thank you, my dear. They are much prettier than
any I have had in my garden this year. Please sit down," for Ellen was doubtful about availing
herself of the proffered chair. She had so hoped that she might find Cynthia alone. She had
dreamed, as a lover might have done, of a tête-à-tête with her, what she would say, what Cynthia
would say. She had thought, and trembled at the thought, that possibly Cynthia might kiss her
when she came or went. She had felt, with a thrill of spirit, the touch of Cynthia's soft lips
on hers, she had smelt the violets about her clothes. Now it was all spoiled. She remembered
things which she had heard about Mr. Risley's friendship with Cynthia, how he had danced attendance
upon her for half a lifetime, and thought that she did not like him. She looked at his smiling,
grizzled, blond face with distrust. She felt intuitively that he saw straight through her little
subterfuge of the flowers, that he divined her girlish worship at the shrine of Cynthia, and
was making fun of her.

"Do you object to a cigar, Miss Brewster?" asked Robert, and Risley looked inquiringly at her.

"Oh, no," replied Ellen, with the eager readiness of a child to fit into new conditions. She
thought of the sitting-room at home, blue with the rank pipe-smoke of Nahum Beals and his kind.
She pictured them to herself sitting about on these warm evenings in their shirt-sleeves, and
she saw the two gentlemen in their light summer clothes with their fragrant cigars at their
lips, and all of a sudden she realized that between these men and the others there was a great
gulf, and that she was trying to cross it. She did not realize, as later, that the gulf was
one of externals, and of width rather than depth, but it seemed to her then that from one shore
she could only see dimly the opposite. A great fear and jealousy came over her as to her own
future accessibility to those of the other kind among whom she had been brought up, like her
father and Granville.

Ellen felt all this as she sat beside Cynthia, who was casting about in her mind, in rather
an annoyed fashion, for something to say to this young beneficiary of hers which should not
have anything to do with the benefit.

Finally she inquired if she were having a pleasant vacation, and Ellen replied that she was.
Risley looked at her beautiful face with the double radiance of the electric-light and the
lamp-light from the window on it, giving it a curious effect. It suddenly occurred to him to
wonder why everybody seemed to have such an opinion as to the talents of this girl. Why did
Cynthia consider that her native ability warranted this forcible elevation of her from her
own sphere and setting her on a height of education above her kind? She looked and spoke like
an ordinary young girl. She had a beautiful face, it is true, and her shyness seemed due to
the questioning attitude of a child rather than to self-consciousness, but, after all, why
did she give people that impression? Her valedictory had been clever, no doubt, and there was
in it a certain fire of conviction, which, though crude, was moving; but, after all, almost
any bright girl might have written it. She had been a fine scholar, no doubt, but any girl
with a ready intelligence might have done as well. Whence came this inclination of all to rear
the child upon a pedestal? Risley wondered, looking at her, narrowing his keen, light eyes
under reflective brows, puffing at his cigar; then he admitted to himself that he was one with
the crowd of Ellen's admirers. There was somehow about the girl that which gave the impression
of an enormous reserve out of all proportion to any external evidence. "The child says nothing
remarkable," he told Cynthia, after she had gone that evening, "but somehow she gives me an
impression of power to say something extraordinary, and do something extraordinary. There is
electricity and steel behind that soft, rosy flesh of hers. But all she does which is evident
to the eye of man is to worship you, Cynthia."

"Worship me?" repeated Cynthia, vaguely.

"Yes, she has one of those aberrations common to her youth and her sex. She is repeating a
madness of old Greece, and following you as a nymph might a goddess."

"It is only because she is grateful," returned Cynthia, looking rather annoyed.

"Gratitude may be a factor in it, but it is very far from being the whole of the matter. It
is one of the spring madnesses of life; but don't be alarmed, it will be temporary in the case
of a girl like that. She will easily be led into her natural track of love. Do you know, Cynthia,
that she is one of the most normal, typical young girls I ever saw, and that makes me wonder
more at this impression of unusual ability which she undoubtedly gives. She has all the weaknesses
of her age and sex, she is much younger than some girls of her age, and yet there is the impression
which I cannot shake off."

"I have it, too," said Cynthia, rather impatiently.

"Cynthia Lennox, I don't believe you care in the least for this young devotee of yours, for
all you are heaping benefits upon her," Risley said, looking at her quizzically.

"I am not sure that I do," replied Cynthia, calmly.

"Then why on earth--?"

Suddenly Cynthia began speaking rapidly and passionately, straightening herself in her chair.
"Oh, Lyman, do you think I could do a thing like that, and not repent it and suffer remorse
for it all these years?" she cried.

"A thing like that?"

"Like stealing that child," Cynthia replied, in a whisper.

"Stealing the child? You did not steal the child."

"Yes, I did."

"Why, it was only a few hours that you kept her."

"What difference does it make whether you steal anything for a few hours or a lifetime? I kept
her, and she was crying for her mother, and her mother was suffering tortures all that time.
Then I kept it secret all these years. You didn't know what I have suffered, Lyman."

Cynthia regarded him with a wan look.

Risley half laughed, then checked himself. "My poor girl, you have the New England conscience
in its worst form," he said.

"You yourself told me it was a serious thing I was doing," Cynthia said, half resentfully.
"One does not wish one's sin treated lightly when one has hugged its pricks to one's bosom
for so long--it detracts from the dignity of suffering."

"So I did, but all those years ago!"

"If you don't leave me my remorse, how can I atone for the deed?"

"Cynthia, you are horribly morbid."

"Maybe you are right, maybe it is worse than morbid. Sometimes I think I am unnatural, out
of drawing, but I did not make myself, and how can I help it?"  Cynthia spoke with a pathetic
little laugh.

She leaned her head back in her chair, and looked at a star through a gap in the vines. The
shadows of the leaves played over her long, white figure. Again to Risley, gazing at her, came
the conviction as of subtle spiritual deformity in the woman; she was unnatural in something
the same fashion that an orchid is unnatural, and it was worse, because presumably the orchid
does not know it is an orchid and regret not being another, more evenly developed, flower,
and Cynthia had a full realization and a mental mirror clear enough to see the twist in her
own character.

Risley had never kissed her in his life, but that night, when they parted, he laid a hand on
her soft, gray hair, and smoothed it back with a masculine motion of tenderness, leaving her
white forehead, which had a candid, childish fulness about the temples, bare. Then he put his
lips to it.

"You are a silly girl, Cynthia," he said.

"I wish I were different, Lyman," she responded, and, he felt, with a double meaning.

"I don't," he said, and stroked her hair with a great tenderness, which seemed for the time
to quite fill and satisfy his heart. He was a man of measureless patience, born to a firm conviction
of the journey's end.

"There are worse things than loving a good woman your whole life and never having her," he
said to himself as he went home, but he said it without its full meaning. Risley's "nerves"
were always lighted by the lamp of his own hope, which threw a gleam over unknown seas.

Chapter XXVI

Robert Lloyd accompanied Ellen home, though she had said timidly that she was not in the least
afraid, that she would not trouble any one, that she could take a car. Cynthia herself had
insisted that Robert should escort her.

"It's too late for you to be out alone," she said, and the girl seemed to perceive dimly a
hedge of conventionality which she had not hitherto known. She had often taken a car when she
was alone of an evening, without a thought of anything questionable. Some of the conductors
lived near Ellen, and she felt as if she were under personal friendly escort. "I know the conductor
on that car, and it would take me right home, and I am not in the least afraid," she said to
Robert, as the car came rocking down the street when they emerged from Cynthia's grounds.

"It's a lovely night," Robert said, speaking quickly as they paused on the sidewalk. "I am
not going to let you go alone, anyway. We will take the car if you say so, but what do you
say to walking? It's a lovely night."

It actually flashed through Ellen's mind--to such small issues of finance had she been accustomed--that
the young man might insist upon paying her car-fare if he went with her on the car.

"I would like to walk, but I am sorry to put you to so much trouble," she said, a little awkwardly.

"Oh, I like to walk," returned Robert. "I don't walk half enough," and they went together down
the lighted street. Suddenly to Ellen there came a vivid remembrance, so vivid that it seemed
almost like actual repetition of the time when she, a little child, maddened by the sudden
awakening of the depths of her nature, had come down this same street. She saw that same brilliant
market-window where she had stopped and stared, to the momentary forgetfulness of her troubles
in the spectacular display of that which was entirely outside them. Curiously enough, Robert
drew her to a full stop that night before the same window. It was one of those strange cases
of apparent telepathy which one sometimes notices. When Ellen looked at the market-window,
with a flash of reminiscence, Robert immediately drew her to a stop before it. "That is quite
a study in color," he said. "I fancy there are a good many unrecognized artists among market-men."

"Yes, it is really beautiful," agreed Ellen, looking at it with eyes which had changed very
little from their childish outlook. Again she saw more than she saw. The window differed materially
from that before which she had stood fascinated so many years ago, for that was in a different
season. Instead of frozen game and winter vegetables, were the products of summer gardens,
and fruits, and berries. The color scheme was dazzling with great heaps of tomatoes, and long,
emerald ears of corn, and baskets of apples, and gold crooks of summer squashes, and speckled
pods of beans.

"Suppose," said Robert, as they walked on, "that all the market-men who had artistic tastes
had art educations and set up studios and painted pictures, who would keep the markets?"

He spoke gayly. His manner that night was younger and merrier than Ellen had ever seen it.
She was naturally rather grave herself. What she had seen of life had rather disposed her to
a hush of respect than to hilarity, but somehow his mood began to infect her.

"I don't know," she answered, laughing, "I suppose somebody would keep the markets."

"Yes, but they would not be as good markets. That is, they would not do as artistic markets,
and they would not serve the higher purpose of catering to the artistic taste of man, as well
as to his bodily needs."

"Perhaps a picture like that is just as well and better than it would be painted and hung on
a wall," Ellen admitted, reflectively.

"Just so--why is it not?" Robert said, in a pleased voice.

"Yes, I think it is," said Ellen. "I do think it is better, because everybody can see it there.
Ever so many people will see it there who would not go to picture-galleries to see it, and then--"

"And then it may go far to dignify their daily needs," said Robert. "For instance, a poor man
about to buy his to-morrow's dinner may feel his soul take a little fly above the prices of
turnips and cabbages."

"Maybe," said Ellen, but doubtfully.

"Don't you think so?"

"The prices of turnips and cabbages may crowd other things out," Ellen replied, and her tone
was sad, almost tragic. "You see I am right in it, Mr. Lloyd," she said, earnestly.

"You mean right in the midst of the kind of people whom necessity forces to neglect the æsthetic
for the purely useful?"

"Yes," said Ellen. Then she added, in an indescribably pathetic voice, "People have to live
first before they can see, and they can't think until they are fed, and one needs always to
have had enough turnips and cabbages to eat without troubling about the getting them, in order
to see in them anything except food."

Lloyd looked at her curiously. "Decidedly this child can think," he reflected. He shrugged
his arm, on which Ellen's hand lay, a little closer to his side.

Just then they were passing the great factories--Lloyd's, and Briggs's, and Maguire's. Many
of the windows in Briggs's and Maguire's reflected light from the moon and the electric-lamps
on the street. Lloyd's was all dark except for one brilliant spark of light, which seemed to
be threading the building like a will-o'-the-wisp. "That is the night-watchman," said Robert.
"He must have a dull time of it."

"I should think he might be afraid," said Ellen.

"Afraid of what?"

"Of ghosts."

"Ghosts in a shoe-shop?" asked Robert, laughing.

"I don't believe there has been another building in the whole city which has held so many heart-aches,
and I always wondered if they didn't make ghosts instead of dead people," Ellen said.

"Do you think they have such a hard time?"

"I know they do," said Ellen. "I think I ate the knowledge along with my first daily bread."

Robert Lloyd looked down at the light, girlish figure on his arm, and again the resolution
that he would not talk on such topics with a young girl like this came over him. He felt a
reluctance to do so which was quite apart from his masculine scorn of a girl's opinion on such
matters. Somehow he did not wish to place Ellen Brewster on the same level of argument on which
another man might have stood. He felt a jealousy of doing so. She seemed more within his reach,
and infinitely more for his pleasure, where she was. He looked admiringly down at her fair
face fixed on his with a serious, intent expression. He was quite ready to admit that he might
fall in love with her. He was quite ready to ask now why he should not. She was a beautiful
girl, an uncommon girl. She was going to be thoroughly educated. It would probably be quite
possible to divorce her entirely from her surroundings. He shuddered when he thought of her
mother and aunt, but, after all, a man, if he were firm, need not marry the mother or aunt.
And all this was in spite of a resolution which he had formed on due consideration after his
last call upon Ellen. He had said to himself that it would not in any case be wise, that he
had better not see more of her than he could help. Instead of going to see her, he had gone
riding with Maud Hemingway, who lived near his uncle's, in an old Colonial house which had
belonged to her great-grandfather. The girl was a good comrade, so good a comrade that she
shunted, as it were, love with flings of ready speech and friendly greeting, and tennis-rackets
and riding-whips and foils. Robert had been teaching Maud to fence, and she had fenced too
well. Still, Robert had said to himself that he might some day fall in love with her and marry
her. He charged his memory with the fact that this was a much more rational course than visiting
a girl like Ellen Brewster, so he stayed away in spite of involuntary turnings of his thoughts
in that direction. However, now when the opportunity had seemed to be fairly forced upon him,
what was he to do? He felt that he was stirred as he had never been before. The girl's very
soul seemed to meet his when she looked up at him with those serious blue eyes of hers. He
knew that there had never been any like her for him, but he felt as if in another minute, if
they did not drop topics which he might as well have discussed with another man, this butterfly
of femininity which so delighted him would be beyond his hand. He wanted to keep her to her rose.

"But the knowledge must not imbitter your life," he said. "It is not for a little, delicate
girl to worry herself over the problems which are too much for men."

In spite of himself a tenderness had come into his voice. Ellen looked down and away from him.
She trembled.

"It seems to me that the problems of life, like those in the algebra we studied at school,
are for everybody who can read them, whether men or women," said she, but her voice was unsteady.

"Some of them are for men to read and struggle with for the sake of the women," said Robert.
His voice had a tender inflection. They were passing a garden full of old-fashioned flowers,
bordered with box. The scent of the box seemed fairly to clamor over the garden fence, drowning
out the smaller fragrances of the flowers, like the clamor of a mob. Even the sweetness of
the mignonette was faintly perceived.

"How strong the box is," said Ellen, imperceptibly shrinking a little from Robert.

When they reached the Brewster house Robert said, as kindly as Granville Joy might have done,
"Cannot we get better acquainted, Miss Brewster? May I call upon you sometimes?"

"I shall be happy to see you," Ellen said, repeating the formula of welcome like a child, but
she knew when she repeated it that it was very true. After she had parted from young Lloyd,
she went into the sitting-room where were her mother and father, her mother sewing on a wrapper,
her father reading the paper. Both of them looked up as the girl entered, and both stared at
her in a bewildered way without rightly knowing why. Ellen's cheeks were a wonderful color,
her eyes fairly blazed with blue light, her mouth was smiling in that ineffable smile of a
simple overflow of happiness.

"Did you ride home on the car?" asked Fanny. "I didn't hear it stop."

"No, mother."

"Did you come home alone?" asked Andrew, abruptly.

"No," said Ellen, blinking before the glare of the lamp. Fanny looked at Andrew. "Who did come
home with you?" she asked, in a foolish, fond voice.

"Mr. Robert Lloyd. He was sitting on the piazza when I got there. I told Miss Lennox I had
just as soon come on the cars alone, but she wouldn't let me, and then he said it would be
pleasant to walk, and--"

"Oh, you needn't make so many excuses," said Fanny, laughing.

Ellen colored until her face was a blaze of roses, she blinked harder, and turned her head
away impatiently.

"I am not making excuses," said she, as if her modesty were offended. "I wish you wouldn't
talk so, mother. I couldn't help it."

"Of course you couldn't," her mother called out jocularly, as Ellen went into the other room
to get her lamp to go to bed.

Fanny was radiant with delight. After Ellen had gone up-stairs, she kept looking at Andrew,
and longing to confide in him her anticipation with regard to Ellen and young Lloyd, but she
refrained, being doubtful as to how he would take it. Andrew looked very sober. The girl's
beautiful, metamorphosed face was ever before his eyes, and it was with him as if he were looking
after the flight of a beloved bird into a farther blue which was sacred, even from the following
of his love.

Chapter XXVII

Ellen's first impulse, when she really began to love Robert Lloyd, was not yielding, but flight;
her first sensation, not happiness, but shame. When he left her that night she realized, to
her unspeakable dismay and anger, that he had not left her, that he would never in her whole
life, or at least it seemed so, leave her again. Everywhere she looked she saw his face projected
by her memory before her with all the reality of life. His face came between her and her mother's
and father's, it came between her and her thoughts of other faces. When she was alone in her
chamber, there was the face. She blew out the lamp in a panic of resentment and undressed in
the dark, but that made no difference. When she lay in bed, although she closed her eyes resolutely,
she could still see it.

"I won't have it; I won't have it," she said, quite aloud in her shame and rebellion. "I won't
have it. What does this mean?"

In spite of herself the sound of his voice was in her ears, and she resented that; she fought
against the feeling of utter rapture which came stealing over her because of it. She felt as
if she wanted to spring out of bed and run, run far away into the freedom of the night, if
only by so doing she could outspeed herself. Ellen began to realize the tyranny of her own
nature, and her whole soul arose in revolt.

But the girl could no more escape than a nymph of old the pursuit of the god, and there was
no friendly deity to transform her into a flower to elude him. When she slept at last she was
overtaken in the innocent passion of dreams, and when she awoke it was, to her angry sensitiveness,
not alone.

When she went down-stairs all her rosy radiance of the night before was eclipsed. She looked
pale and nervous. She recoiled whenever her mother began to speak. It seemed to her that if
she said anything, and especially anything congratulatory about Robert Lloyd, she would fly
at her like a wild thing. Fanny kept looking at her with loving facetiousness, and Ellen winced
indescribably; still, she did not say anything until after breakfast, when Andrew had gone
to work. Andrew was unusually sober and preoccupied that morning. When he went out he passed
close to Ellen, as she sat at the table, and tilted up her face and kissed her. "Father's blessin',"
he whispered, hoarsely, in her ear. Ellen nestled against him. This natural affection, before
which she need not fly nor be ashamed, which she had always known, seemed to come before her
like a shield against all untried passion. She felt sheltered and comforted. But Andrew passed
Eva Tenny coming to the house on his way out of the yard, and when she entered Fanny began at once:

"Who do you s'pose came home with Ellen last night?" said she. She looked at Eva, then at Ellen,
with a glance which seemed to uncover a raw surface of delicacy. Ellen flushed angrily.

"Mother, I do wish--" she began; but Fanny cut her short.

"She's pretendin' she don't like it," she said, almost hilariously, her face glowing with triumph,
"but she does. You ought to have seen her when she came in last night."

"I guess I know who it was," said Eva, but she echoed her sister's manner half-heartedly. She
was looking very badly that morning, her face was stained, and her eye hard with a look as
if tears had frozen in them. She had come in a soiled waist, too, without any collar.

"For Heaven's sake, Eva Tenny, what ails you?" Fanny cried.

Eva flung herself for answer on the floor, and fairly writhed. Words were not enough expression
for her violent temperament. She had to resort to physical manifestations or lose her reason.
As she writhed, she groaned as one might do who was dying in extremity of pain.

Ellen, when she heard her aunt's groans, stopped, and stood in the entry viewing it all. She
thought at first that her aunt was ill, and was just about to call out to know if she should
go for the doctor, all her grievances being forgotten in this evidently worse stress, when
her mother fairly screamed again, stooping over her sister, and trying to raise her.

"Eva Tenny, you tell me this minute what the matter is."

Then Eva raised herself on one elbow, and disclosed a face distorted with wrath and woe, like
a mask of tragedy.

"He's gone! he's gone!" she shrieked out, in an awful, shrill voice, which was like the note
of an angry bird. "He's gone!"

"For God's sake, not--Jim?"

"Yes, he's gone! he's gone! Oh, my God! my God! he's gone!"

All at once the little Amabel appeared, slipping past Ellen silently. She stood watching her
mother. She was vibrating from head to foot as if strung on wires. She was not crying, but
she kept catching her breath audibly; her little hands were twitching in the folds of her frock;
she winked rapidly, her lids obscuring and revealing her eyes until they seemed a series of
blue sparks. She was no paler than usual--that was scarcely possible--but her skin looked transparent,
pulses were evident all over her face and her little neck.

"You don't mean he's gone with--?" gasped Fanny.

Suddenly Eva raised herself with a convulsive jerk from the floor to her feet. She stood quite
still. "Yes, he has gone," she said, and all the passion was gone from her voice, which was
much more terrible in its calm.

"You don't mean with--?"

"Yes; he has gone with Aggie."  Eva spoke in a voice like a deaf-mute's, quite free from inflections.
There was something dreadful about her rigid attitude. Little Amabel looked at her mother's
eyes, then cowered down and began to cry aloud. Ellen came in and took her in her arms, whispering
to her to soothe her. She tried to coax her away, but the child resisted violently, though
she was usually so docile with Ellen.

Eva did not seem to notice Amabel's crying. She stood in that horrible inflexibility, with
eyes like black stones fixed on something unseeable.

Fanny clutched her violently by the arm and shook her.

"Eva Tenny," said she, "you behave yourself. What if he has run away? You ain't the first woman
whose husband has run away. I'd have more pride. I wouldn't please him nor her enough. If he's
as bad as that, you're better off rid of him."

Eva turned on her sister, and her calm broke up like ice under her fire of passion.

"Don't you say one word against him, not one word!" she shrieked, throwing off Fanny's hand.
"I won't hear one word against my husband."

Then little Amabel joined in. "Don't you say one word against my papa!" she cried, in her shrill,
childish treble. Then she sobbed convulsively, and pushed Ellen away. "Go away!" she said,
viciously, to her. She was half mad with terror and bewilderment.

"Don't you say one word against Jim," said Eva again. "If ever I hear anybody say one word
against him I'll--"

"You don't mean you're goin' to stan' up for him, Eva Tenny?"

"As long as I draw the breath of life, and after, if I know anything," declared Eva. Then she
straightened herself to her full height, threw back her shoulders, and burst into a furious
denunciation like some prophetess of wrath. The veins on her forehead grew turgid, her lips
seemed to swell, her hair seemed to move as she talked. The others shrank back and looked at
her; even little Amabel hushed her sobs and stared, fascinated. "Curses on the grinding tyranny
that's brought it all about, and not on the poor, weak man that fell under it!" she cried.
"Jim ain't to blame. He's had bigger burdens put on his shoulders than the Lord gave him strength
to bear. He had to drop 'em. Jim has tried faithful ever since we were married. He worked hard,
and it wa'n't never his fault that he lost his place, but he kept losin' it. They kept shuttin'
down, or dischargin' him for no reason at all, without a minute's warnin'. An' it wa'n't because
he drank. Jim never drank when he had a job. He was just taken up and put down by them over
him as if he was a piece on a checker-board. He lost his good opinion of himself when he saw
others didn't set any more by him than to shove him off or on the board as it suited their
play. He began to think maybe he wa'n't a man, and then he began to act as if he wasn't a man.
And he was ashamed of his life because he couldn't support me and Amabel, ashamed of his life
because he had to live on my little earnin's. He was ashamed to look me in the face, and ashamed
to look his own child in the face. It was only night before last he was talkin' to me, and
I didn't know what he meant then, but I know now. I thought then he meant something else, but
now I know what he meant. He sat a long time leanin' his head on his hands, whilst I was sewin'
on wrappers, after Amabel had gone to bed, and finally he looks up and says, 'Eva, you was
right and I was wrong.'

"'What do you mean, Jim?' says I.

"'I mean you was right when you thought we'd better not get married, and I was wrong,' says
he; and he spoke terrible bitter and sad. I never heard him speak like it. He sounded like
another man. I jest flung down my sewin' and went over to him, and leaned his poor head against
my shoulder. 'Jim,' says I, 'I 'ain't never regretted it.' And God knows I spoke the truth,
and I speak the truth when I say it now. I 'ain't never regretted it, and I don't regret it
now."  Eva said the last with a look as if she were hurling defiance, then she went on in the
same high, monotonous key above the ordinary key of life. "When I says that, he jest gives
a great sigh and sort of pushes me away and gets up. 'Well, I have,' says he; 'I have, and
sometimes I think the best thing I can do is to take myself out of the way, instead of sittin'
here day after day and seein' you wearin' your fingers to the bone to support me, and seein'
my child, an' bein' ashamed to look her in the face. Sometimes I think you an' Amabel would
be a damned sight better off without me than with me, and I'm done for anyway, and it don't
make much difference what I do next.'

"'Jim Tenny, you jest quit talkin' in such a way as this,' says I, for I thought he meant to
make away with himself, but that wa'n't what he meant. Aggie Bemis had been windin' her net
round him, and he wa'n't nothin' but a man, and all discouraged, and he gave in. Any man would
in his place. He ain't to blame. It's the tyrants that's over us all that's to blame."  Eva's
voice shrilled higher. "Curse them!" she shrieked. "Curse them all!--every rich man in this
gold-ridden country!"

"Eva Tenny, you're beside yourself," said Fanny, who was herself white to her lips, yet she
viewed her sister indignantly, as one violent nature will view another when it is overborne
and carried away by a kindred passion.

"Wonder if you'd be real calm in my place?" said Eva; and as she spoke the dreadful impassibility
of desperation returned upon her. It was as if she suffered some chemical change before their
eyes. She became silent and seemed as if she would never speak again.

"You hadn't ought to talk so," said Fanny, weakly, she was so terrified. "You ought to think
of poor little Amabel," she added.

With that, Eva's dreadful, expressionless eyes turned towards Amabel, and she held out her
hand to her, but the child fairly screamed with terror and clung to Ellen. "Oh, Aunt Eva, don't
look at her so, you frighten her," Ellen said, trembling, and leaning her cheek against Amabel's
little, cold, pale one. "Don't cry, darling," she whispered. "It is just because poor mother
feels so badly."

"I am afraid of my mamma, and I want papa!" screamed Amabel, quivering, and stiffening her
slender back.

Eva continued to keep her eyes fixed upon her, and to hold out that commanding hand.

Fanny went close to her, seized her by both shoulders, and shook her violently. "Eva Tenny,
you behave yourself!" said she. "There ain't no need of your acting this way if your man has
run away with another woman, and as for that child goin' with you, she sha'n't go one step
with any woman that looks and acts as you do. Actin' this way over a good-for-nothin' fellow
like Jim Tenny!"

Again that scourge of the spirit aroused Eva to her normal state. She became a living, breathing,
wrathful, loving woman once more. "Don't you dare say a word against Jim!" she cried out; "not
one word, Fanny Brewster; I won't hear it. Don't you dare say a word!"

"Don't you say a word against my papa!" shrilled Amabel. Then she left Ellen and ran to her
mother, and clung to her. And Eva caught her up, and hugged the little, fragile thing against
her breast, and pounced upon her with kisses, with a fury as of rage instead of love.

"She always looked like Jim," she sobbed out; "she always did. Aggie Bemis shall never get
her. I've got her in spite of all the awful wrong of life; it's the good that had to come out
of it whether or no, and God couldn't help Himself. I've got this much. She always looked like
Jim."

Eva set Amabel down and began leading her out of the room.

"You ain't goin'?" said Fanny, who had herself begun to weep. "Eva, you ain't goin'? Oh, you
poor girl!"

"Don't!--you said that like Jim," Eva cried, with a great groan of pain.

"Eva, you ain't goin'? Wait a little while, and let me do somethin' for you."

"You can't do anything. Come, Amabel."

Eva and Amabel went away, the child rolling eyes of terror and interrogation at them, Eva impervious
to all her sister's pleading.

When Andrew heard what had happened, and Fanny repeated what Eva had said, his blame for Jim
Tenny was unqualified. "I've had a hard time enough, knocked about from pillar to post, and
I know what she means when she talks about a checker-board. God knows I feel myself sometimes
as if I wasn't anything but a checker-piece instead of a man," he said, "but it's all nonsense
blamin' the shoe-manufacturers for his runnin' away with that woman. A man has got to use what
little freedom he's got right. It ain't any excuse for Jim Tenny that he's been out of work
and got discouraged. He's a good-for-nothing cur, an' I'd like to tell him so."

"It won't do for you to talk to Eva that way," said Fanny. They were all at the supper-table.
Ellen was listening silently.

"She does right to stand up for her husband, I suppose," said Andrew, "but anybody's got to
use a little sense. It don't make it any better for Jim, tryin' to shove blame off his shoulders
that belongs there. The manufacturers didn't make him run off with another woman and leave
his child. That was a move he made himself."

"But he wouldn't have made that move if the manufacturers hadn't made theirs," Ellen said,
unexpectedly.

"That's so," said Fanny.

Andrew looked uneasily at Ellen, in whose cheeks two red spots were burning, and whose eyes
upon his face seemed narrowed to two points of brightness. "There's nothing for you to worry
about, child," he said.

All this was before the dressmaker, who listened with no particular interest. Affairs which
did not directly concern her did not awaken her to much sharpness of regard. She had been forced
by circumstances into a very narrow groove of life, a little foot-path as it were, fenced in
from destruction by three dollars a day. She could not, view it as keenly as she might, see
that Jim Tenny's elopement had anything whatever to do with her three dollars per day. She,
therefore, ate her supper. At first Andrew had looked warningly at Fanny when she began to
discuss the subject before the dressmaker, but Fanny had replied, "Oh, land, Andrew, she knows
all about it now. It's all over town."

"Yes, I heard it this morning before I came," said the dressmaker. "I think a puff on the sleeves
of the silk waist will be very pretty, don't you, Mrs. Brewster?"

Ellen looked at the dressmaker with wonder; it seemed to her that the woman was going on a
little especial side track of her own outside the interests of her kind. She looked at her
pretty new things and tried them on, and felt guilty that she had them. What business had she
having new clothes and going to Vassar College in the face of that misery? What was an education?
What was anything compared with the sympathy which love demanded of love in the midst of sorrow?
Should she not turn her back upon any purely personal advantage as she would upon a moral plague?

When Ellen's father said that to her at the supper-table she looked at him with unchildlike
eyes. "I think it is something for me to worry about, father," she said. "How can I help worrying
if I love Aunt Eva and Amabel?"

"It's a dreadful thing for Eva," said Fanny. "I don't see what she is going to do. Andrew,
pass the biscuits to Miss Higgins."

"It seems to me that the one that is the farthest behind anything that happens on this earth
is the one to blame," said Ellen, reverting to her line of argument.

"I don't know but you've got to go back to God, then," said Andrew, soberly, passing the biscuits.
Miss Higgins took one.

"No, you haven't," said Ellen--"you haven't, because men are free. You've got to stop before
you get to God. When a man goes wrong, you have got to look and see if he is to blame, if he
started himself, or other men have been pushing him into it. It seems to me that other men
have been pushing Uncle Jim into it. I don't think factory-owners have any right to discharge
a man without a good reason, any more than he has a right to run the shop."

"I don't think so, either," said Fanny. "I think Ellen is right."

"I don't know. It is all a puzzle," said Andrew. "Something's wrong somewhere. I don't know
whether it's because we are pushed or because we pull. There's no use in your worrying about
it, Ellen. You've got to study your books."  Andrew said this with a look of pride at Ellen
and sidelong triumph at the dressmaker to see if she rightly understood the magnitude of it
all, of the whole situation of making dresses for this wonderful young creature who was going
to Vassar College.

"I don't know but this is more important than books," said Ellen.

"Oh, maybe you'll find out something in your books that will settle the whole matter," said
Andrew. Ellen was not eating much supper, and that troubled him. Andrew always knew just how
much Ellen ate.

"I don't know what Aunt Eva and poor little Amabel will do," said she. Ellen's lip quivered.

"Pass the cake to Miss Higgins," said Fanny, sharply, to Andrew. She gave him a significant
wink as she did so, not to talk more about it.

"Try some of that chocolate cake, Miss Higgins."

"Thank you," said Miss Higgins, unexcitedly.

Andrew had his own cause of worry, and finally reverted to it, eating his food with no more
conception of the savor than if it were in another man's mouth. He was sorry enough for his
wife's sister, and recognized it as an added weight to his own burden, but just at present
all he could think of was the question if Miss Higgins would ask for her pay again that night.
He had not a dollar in his pocket. He had been dunned that afternoon by the man who had lent
the money to buy Ellen's watch, there were two new dunning letters in his pocket, and now if
that keen little dressmaker, who fairly looked to him like a venomous insect, as she sat eating
rather voraciously of the chocolate cake, should ask him again for the three dollars due her
that night! He would not have cared so much, if it were not for the fact that she would ask
him before his wife and Ellen, and the question about the money in the savings-bank, which
was a species of nightmare to him, would be sure to come to the front.

Suddenly it struck Andrew that he might run away, that he might slip out after supper, and
either go into his mother's house or down the street. He finally decided on the former, since
he reasoned, with a pitiful cunning, that if he went down the street he would have to take
off his slippers and put on his shoes, and that would at once betray him and lead to the possible
arrest of his flight.

So after supper, while Miss Higgins was trying a waist on Ellen, and Fanny was clearing the
table, Andrew, bareheaded and in his slippers, prepared to carry his plan into execution. He
got out without being seen, and hurried around the rear of the house, out of view from the
sitting-room windows, resolving on the way that in order to avert the danger of a possible
following him to the sanctuary of his mother's house, he had perhaps better slip down into
the orchard behind it and see if the porter apples were ripe. But when, stooping as if beneath
some invisible shield, and moving with a low glide of secrecy, he had gained the yard between
the two houses, the yard where the three cherry-trees stood, he heard Fanny's high, insistent
voice calling him, and knew that it was all over. Fanny had her head thrust out of her bedroom
window. "Andrew! Andrew!" she called.

Andrew stopped. "What is it?" he asked, in a gruff voice. He felt at that moment savage with
her and with fate. He felt like some badgered animal beneath the claws and teeth of petty enemies
which were yet sufficient to do him to death. He felt that retreat and defence were alike impossible
and inglorious. He was aware of a monstrous impatience with it all, which was fairly blasphemy.
"What is it?" he said, and Fanny realized that something was wrong.

"Come here, Andrew Brewster," she said, from the bedroom window, and Andrew pressed close to
the window through a growth of sweetbrier which rasped his hands and sent up a sweet fragrance
in his face. Andrew tore away the clinging vines angrily.

"Well, what is it?" he said again.

"Don't spoil that bush, Ellen sets a lot by it," said Fanny. "What makes you act so, Andrew
Brewster?"  Then she lowered her voice. "She wants to know if she can have her pay to-night,"
she whispered.

"I 'ain't got a cent," replied Andrew, in a dogged, breathless voice.

"You 'ain't been to the bank to-day, then?"

"No, I 'ain't."

Fanny still suspected nothing. She was, in fact, angry with the dressmaker for insisting upon
her pay in such a fashion. "I never heard of such a thing as her wantin' to be paid every night,"
she whispered, angrily, "and I'd tell her so, if I wasn't afraid she'd think we couldn't pay
her. I'd never have had her; I'd had Miss Patch, if I'd know she'd do such a mean thing, but,
as it is, I don't know what to do. I 'ain't got but a dollar and seventy-three cents by me.
You 'ain't got enough to make it up?"

"No, I 'ain't."

"Well, all is, I've got to tell her that it ain't convenient for me to pay her to-night, and
she shall have it all together to-morrow night, and to-morrow you'll have to go to the bank
and take out the money, Andrew. Don't forget it."

"Well," said Andrew.

Fanny retreated, and he heard her high voice explaining to Miss Higgins. He tore his way through
the clinging sweetbrier bushes and ran with an unsteady, desperate gait down to the orchard
behind his mother's home, and flung himself at full length in the dewy grass under the trees
with all the abandon, under stress of fate, of a child.

Chapter XXVIII

Andrew Brewster, lying in the dewy grass under the apple-trees, giving way for almost the first
time since his childhood to impulses which had hitherto, from his New England heredity, stiffened
instead of relaxed his muscles of expression, felt as if he were being stung to death by ants.
He was naturally a man of broad views, who felt the indignity of coping with such petty odds.
"For God's sake, if I had to be done to death, why couldn't it have been for something?" he
groaned, speaking with his lips close to the earth as if it were a listening ear. "Why need
it all have been over so little? It's just the little fight for enough to eat and wear that's
getting the better of me that was a man, and able to do a man's work in the world. Now it has
come to this! Here I am runnin' away from a woman because she wants me to pay her three dollars,
and I am afraid of another woman because--I've been and fooled away a few hundred dollars I
had in the savings-bank. I'm afraid--yes, it has come to this. I am afraid, afraid, and I'd
run away out of life if I knew where it would fetch me to. I'm afraid of things that ain't
worth being afraid of, and it's all over things that's beneath me."  There came over Andrew,
with his mouth to the moist earth, feeling the breath and the fragrance of it in his nostrils,
a realization of the great motherhood of nature, and a contempt for himself which was scorching
and scathing before it. He felt that he came from that mighty breast which should produce only
sons of might, and was spending his whole life in an ignominy of fruitless climbing up mole-hills.
"Why couldn't I have been more?" he asked himself. "Oh, my God, is it my fault?"  He said to
himself that if he had not yielded to the universal law and longing of his kind for a home
and a family, it might have been better. He asked himself that question which will never be
answered with a surety of correctness, whether the advancement of the individual to his furthest
compass is more to the glory of life than the blind following out of the laws of existence
and the bringing others into the everlasting problem of advance. Then he thought of Ellen,
and a great warmth of conviction came over the loving heart of the man; all his self-contempt
vanished. He had her, this child who was above pearls and rubies, he had her, and in her the
furthest reach of himself and progression of himself to greater distances than he could ever
have accomplished in any other way, and it was a double progress, since it was not only for
him, but also for the woman he had married. A great wave of love for Fanny came over him. He
seemed to see that, after all, it was a shining road by which he had come, and he saw himself
upon it like a figure of light. He saw that he lived and could never die. Then, as with a remorseless
hurl of a high spirit upon needle-pricks of petty cares, he thought again of the dressmaker,
of the money for Ellen's watch, of the butcher's bill, and the grocer's bills, and the money
which he had taken from the bank, and again he cowered beneath and loathed his ignoble burden.
He dug his hot head into the grass. "Oh, my God! oh, my God!" he groaned. He fairly sobbed.
Then he felt a soft wind of feminine skirts caused by the sudden stoop of some one beside him,
and Ellen's voice, shrill with alarm, rang in his ears. "Father, what is the matter? Father!"

Such was the man's love for the girl that his first thought was for her alarm, and he pushed
all his own troubles into the background with a lightning-like motion. He raised himself hastily,
and smiled at her with his pitiful, stiff face. "It's nothing at all, Ellen, don't you worry,"
he said.

But that was not enough to satisfy her. She caught hold of his arm and clung to it. "Father,"
she said, in a tone which had in it, to his wonder, a firm womanliness--his own daughter seemed
to speak to him as if she were his mother--"you are not telling me the truth. Something is
the matter, or you wouldn't do like this."

"No, there's nothin', nothin' at all, dear child," said Andrew. He tried to loosen her little,
clinging hand from his arm. "Come, let's go back to the house," he said. "Don't you mind anything
about it. Sometimes father gets discouraged over nothin'."

"It isn't over nothing," said Ellen. "What is it about, father?"

Andrew tried to laugh. "Well, if it isn't over nothin', it's over nothin' in particular," said
he; "it's over jest what's happened right along. Sometimes father feels as if he hadn't made
as much as he'd ought to out of his life, and he's gettin' older, and he's feelin' kind of
discouraged, that's all."

"Over money matters?" said Ellen, looking at him steadily.

"Over nothin'," said her father. "See here, child, father's ashamed that he gave way so, and
you found him. Now don't you worry one mite about it--it's nothing at all. Come, let's go back
to the house," he said.

Ellen said no more, but she walked up from the field holding tightly to her father's poor,
worn hand, and her heart was in a tumult. To behold any convulsion of nature is no light experience,
and when it is a storm of the spirit in one beloved the beholder is swept along with it in
greater or less measure. Ellen trembled as she walked. Her father kept looking at her anxiously
and remorsefully. Once he reached around his other hand and chucked her playfully under the
chin. "Scared most to death, was she?" he asked, with a shamefaced blush.

"I know something is the matter, and I think it would be better for you to tell me, father,"
replied Ellen, soberly.

"There's nothing to tell, child," said Andrew. "Don't you worry your little head about it."
Between his anxiety lest the girl should be troubled, and his intense humiliation that she
should have discovered him in such an abandon of grief which was almost like a disclosure of
the nakedness of his spirit, he was completely unnerved. Ellen felt him tremble, and heard
his voice quiver when he spoke. She felt towards her father something she had never felt before--an
impulse of protection. She felt the older and stronger of the two. Her grasp on his hand tightened,
she seemed in a measure to be leading him along.

When they reached the yard between the houses Andrew cast an apprehensive glance at the windows.
"Has she gone?" he asked.

"Who, the dressmaker?"

"Yes."

"She hadn't when I came out. I saw you come past the house, and I thought you walked as if
you didn't feel well, so I thought I would run out and see."

"I was all right," replied Andrew. "Have you got to try on anything more to-night?"

"No."

"Well, then, let's run into grandma's a minute."

"All right," said Ellen.

Mrs. Zelotes was sitting at her front window in the dusk, looking out on the street, as was
her favorite custom. The old woman seldom lit a lamp in the summer evening, but sat there staring
out at the lighted street and the people passing and repassing, with her mind as absolutely
passive as regarded herself as if she were travelling and observing only that which passed
without. At those times she became in a fashion sensible of the motion of the world, and lost
her sense of individuality in the midst of it. When her son and granddaughter entered she looked
away from the window with the expression of one returning from afar, and seemed dazed for a moment.

"Hullo, mother!" said Andrew.

The room was dusky, and they moved across between the chairs and tables like two shadows.

"Oh, is it you, Andrew?" said his mother. "Who is that with you--Ellen?"

"Yes," said Ellen. "How do you do, grandma?"

Mrs. Zelotes became suddenly fully awake to the situation; she collected her scattered faculties;
her keen old eyes gleamed in a shaft of electric-light from the street without, which fell
full upon her face.

"Set down," said she. "Has the dressmaker gone?"

"No, she hadn't when I came out," replied Ellen, "but she's most through for to-night."

"How do your things look?"

"Real pretty, I guess."

"Sometimes I think you'd better have had Miss Patch. I hope she 'ain't got your sleeves too
tight at the elbows."

"They seem to fit very nicely, grandma."

"Sleeves are very particular things; a sleeve wrong can spoil a whole dress."

Suddenly the old woman turned on Ellen with a look of extremest facetiousness and intelligence,
and the girl winced, for she knew what was coming. "I see you goin' past with a young man last
night, didn't I?" said she.

Ellen flushed. "Yes," she said, almost indignantly, for she had a feeling as if the veil of
some inner sacredness of her nature were continually being torn aside. "I went over to Miss
Lennox, to carry some sweet-peas, and Mr. Robert Lloyd was there, and he came home with me."

"Oh!" replied her grandmother.

Ellen's patience left her at the sound of that "Oh," which seemed to rasp her very soul. "You
have none of you any right to talk and act as you do," said she. "You make me ashamed of you,
you and mother; father has more sense. Just because a young man makes me a call to return something,
and then walks home with me, because he happened to be at the house where I call in the evening!
I think it's a shame. You make me feel as if I couldn't look him in the face."

"Never mind, grandma didn't mean any harm," Andrew said, soothingly.

"You needn't try to excuse me, Andrew Brewster," cried his mother, angrily. "I guess it's a
pretty to-do, if I can't say a word in joke to my own granddaughter. If it had been a poor,
good-for-nothing young feller workin' in a shoe-factory, I s'pose she'd been tickled to death
to be joked about him, but now when it begins to look as if somebody that was worth while had
come along--"

"Grandma, if you say another word about it, I will never speak to Robert Lloyd again as long
as I live," declared Ellen.

"Never mind, child," whispered Andrew.

"I do mind, and I mean what I say," Ellen cried. "I won't have it. Robert Lloyd is nothing
to me, and I am nothing to him. He is no better than Granville Joy. There is nothing between
us, and you make me too ashamed to think of him."

Then the old woman cried out, in a tone of triumph, "Well, there he is, turnin' in at your
gate now."

Chapter XXIX

Ellen rose without a word, and fled out of the room and out of the house. It seemed to her,
after what had happened, after what her mother and grandmother had said and insinuated, after
what she herself had thought and felt, that she must. She longed to see Robert Lloyd, to hear
him speak, as she had never longed for anything in the world, and yet she ran away as if she
were driven to obey some law which was coeval with the first woman and beyond all volition
of her individual self.

When she reached the head of the little cross street on which the Atkinses lived, she turned
into it with relief. The Atkins house was a tiny cottage, with a little kitchen ell, and a
sagging piazza across the front. On this piazza were shadowy figures, and the dull, red gleam
of pipes, and one fiery tip of a cigar. Joe Atkins, and Sargent, and two other men were sitting
out there in the cool of the evening. Ellen hurried around the curve of the foot-path to the
kitchen door. Abby was in there, working with the swift precision of a machine. She washed
and wiped dishes as if in a sort of fury, her thin elbows jerking, her mouth compressed.

When Ellen entered, Abby stared, then her whole face lighted up, as if from some internal lamp.
"Why, Ellen, is that you?" she said, in a surprisingly sweet voice. Sometimes Abby's sharp
American voice rang with the sweetness of a soft bell.

"I thought I'd run over a minute," said Ellen.

The other girl looked sharply at her. "Why, what's the matter?" she said.

"Nothing is the matter. Why?"

"Why, I thought you looked sort of queer. Maybe it's the light. Sit down; I'll have the dishes
done in a minute, then we'll go into the sitting-room."

"I'd rather stay out here with you," said Ellen.

Abby looked at her again. "There is something the matter, Ellen Brewster," said she; "you can't
cheat me. You would never have run over here this way in the world. What has happened?"

"Let's go up to your room after the dishes are done, and then I'll tell you," whispered Ellen.
The men's voices on the piazza could be heard quite distinctly, and it seemed possible that
their own conversation might be overheard in return.

"All right," said Abby. "Of course I have heard about your aunt," she added, in a low voice.

"Yes," said Ellen, and she felt shamed and remorseful that her own affairs had been uppermost
in her mind, and that Abby had supposed that she might be disturbed over this great trouble
of her poor aunt's.

"I think it is dreadful," said Abby. "I wish I could get hold of that woman."  By "that woman"
she meant the woman with whom poor Jim Tenny had eloped.

"I do," said Ellen, bitterly.

"But it's something besides that made you run over here," said Abby.

"I'll tell you when we go up to your room," replied Ellen.

When the dishes were finished, and the two girls in Abby's little chamber, seated side by side
on the bed, Ellen still hesitated.

"Now, Ellen Brewster, what is the matter? You said you would tell, and you've got to," said Abby.

Ellen looked away from her, blushing. The electric-light from the street shone full in the
room, which was wavering with grotesque shadows.

"Well," said she, "I ran away."

"You ran away! What for?"

"Oh, because."

"Because what?"

"Because I saw somebody coming."

"Saw who coming?"

Ellen was silent.

"Not Granville Joy?"

Ellen shook her head.

"Not--?"

Ellen looked straight ahead.

"Not young Mr. Lloyd?"

Ellen was silent with the silence of assent.

"Did he go into your house?"

Ellen nodded.

"Where were you?"

"In grandma's."

"And you ran away, over here?"

Ellen nodded.

"Why, Ellen Brewster, didn't you want to see him?"

Ellen turned from Abby with an impatient gesture, buried her face in the bed, and began to weep.

Abby leaned over her caressingly. "Ellen dear," she whispered, "what is the matter; what are
you crying for? What made you run away?"

Ellen sobbed harder.

Abby looked at Ellen's prostrate figure sadly. "Ellen," she began; then she stopped, for her
own voice quivered. Then she went on, quite steadily. "Ellen," she said, "you like him."

"No, I don't," declared Ellen. "I won't. I never will. Nothing shall make me."

But Abby continued to look at her sadly and jealously. "There's a power over us which is too
strong for girls," said she, "and you've come under it, Ellen, and you can't help it."  Then
she added, with a great, noble burst of utter unselfishness: "And I'm glad, I'm glad, Ellen.
That man can lift you out of the grind."

But Ellen sat up straight and faced her, with burning cheeks, and eyes shining through tears.
"I will never be lifted out of the grind as long as those I love are in it," said she.

"Do you suppose it would make it any better for your folks to see you in it all your life along
with them?" said Abby. "Suppose you married a fellow like Granville Joy?"

Chapter XXX

Ellen looked at the other girl in a kind of rage of maidenly shame. "Why have I got to get
married, anyway?" she demanded. "Isn't there anything in this world besides getting married?
Why do you all talk so about me? You don't seem so bent on getting married yourself. If you
think so much of marriage, why don't you get married yourself, and let me alone?"

"Nobody wants to marry me that I know of," replied Abby, quite simply. Then she, too, blazed
out. "Get married!" she cried. "Do you really think I would get married to the kind of man
who would marry me? Do you think I could if I loved him?"  A great wave of red surged over
the girl's thin face, her voice trembled with tenderness. Ellen knew at once, with a throb
of sympathy and shame, that Abby did love some one.

"Do you think I would marry him if I loved him?" demanded Abby, stiffening herself into a soldier-like
straightness. "Do you think? I tell you what it is," she said, "I was lookin' only to-day at
David Mendon at the cutting-bench, cutting away with his poor little knife. I'd like to know
how many handles he's worn out since he began. There he was, putting the pattern on the leather,
and cuttin' around it, standin' at his window, that's a hot place in summer and a cold one
in winter, and there's where he's stood for I don't know how many years since before I was
born. He's one of the few that Lloyd's has hung on to when he's got older, and I thought to
myself, good Lord, how that poor man must have loved his wife, and how he must love his children,
to be willin' to turn himself into a machine like that for them. He never takes a holiday unless
he's forced into it; there he stands and cuts and cuts. If I were his wife, I would die of
shame and pity that I ever led him into it. Do you think I would ever let a man turn himself
into a machine for me, if I loved him? I guess I wouldn't! And that's why, when I see a man
of another sort that you won't have to break your own heart over, whether you marry him or
not, payin' attention to you, I am glad. It's a different thing, marriage with a man like Robert
Lloyd, and a man like that would never think of me. I'm right in the ranks, and you ain't."

"I am," said Ellen, stoutly.

"No, you ain't; you don't belong there, and when I see a chance for you to get out where you
belong--"

"I don't intend to make marriage a stepping-stone," said Ellen. "Sometimes--"  She hesitated.

"What?" asked the other girl.

"Sometimes I think I would rather not go to college, after all."

"Ellen Brewster, are you crazy? Of course, you will go to college unless you marry Robert Lloyd.
Perhaps he won't want to wait."  Then Abby, dauntless as she was, shrank a little before Ellen's
wrathful retort.

"Abby Atkins, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!" she cried. "There he's been to see me just
twice, the first time on an errand, and the next with his aunt, and he's walked home with me
once because he couldn't help it; his aunt told him to!"

"But here he is again to-night," said Abby, apologetically.

"What of that? I suppose he has come on another errand."

"Then what made you run away?"

"Because you have all made me ashamed of my life to look at him," said Ellen, hotly.

Then down went her head on the bed again, and Abby was leaning over her, caressing her, whispering
fond things to her like a lover.

"There, there, Ellen," she whispered. "Don't be mad, don't feel bad. I didn't mean any harm.
You are such a beauty--there's nobody like you in the world--that everybody thinks that any
man who sees you must want you."

"Robert Lloyd doesn't, and if he did I wouldn't have him," sobbed Ellen.

"You sha'n't if you don't want him," said Abby, consolingly.

After a while the two girls bathed their eyes with cold water, and went down-stairs into the
sitting-room. Maria was making herself a blue muslin dress, and her mother was hemming the
ruffles. There was a cheap blue shade on the lamp, and Maria herself was clad in a blue gingham.
All the blue color and the shade on the lamp gave a curious pallor and unreality to the homely
room and the two women. Mrs. Atkins's hair was strained back from her hollow temples, which
had noble outlines.

"I'm going to walk a little way with Ellen, she's going home," said Abby.

"Very well," said her mother. Maria looked wistfully at them as they went out. She went on
sewing on her blue muslin, rather sadly. She coughed a little.

"Why don't you put up your sewing for to-night and go to bed, child?" said her mother.

"I might as well sit here and sew as go to bed and lie there. I shouldn't sleep," replied Maria,
with the gentlest sadness conceivable. There was in it no shadow of complaining. Of late years
all the fire of resistance had seemed to die out in the girl. She was unfailingly sweet, but
nerveless. Often when she raised a hand it seemed as if she could not even let it fall, as
if it must remain poised by some curious inertia. Still, she went to the shop every day and
did her work faithfully. She pasted linings in shoes, and her slender little fingers used to
fly as if they were driven by some more subtle machine than any in the factory. Often Maria
felt vaguely as if she were in the grasp of some mighty machine worked by a mighty operator;
she felt, as she pasted the linings, as if she herself were also a part of some monstrous scheme
of work under greater hands than hers, and there was never any getting back of it. And always
with it all there was that ceaseless, helpless, bewildered longing for something, she was afraid
to think what, which often saps the strength and life of a young girl. Maria had never had
a lover in her life; she had not even good comrades among young men, as her sister had. No
man at that time would have ever looked twice at her, unless he had fallen in love with her,
and had been disposed to pick her up and carry her along on the hard road upon which they fared
together. Maria was half fed in every sense; she had not enough nourishing food for her body,
nor love for her heart, nor exercise for her brain. She had no time to read, as she was forced
to sew when out of the shop if she would have anything to wear. When at last she went up-stairs
to bed, before Abby returned, she sat down by her window, and leaned her little, peaked chin
on the sill and looked out. The stars were unusually bright for a summer night; the whole sky
seemed filled with a constantly augmenting host of them. The scent of tobacco came to her from
below. To the lonely girl the stars and the scent of the tobacco served as stimulants; she
formed a forcible wish. "I wish," she muttered to herself, "that I was either an angel or a
man."  Then the next minute she chided herself for her wickedness. A great wave of love for
God, and remorse for impatience and melancholy in her earthly lot, swept over her. She knelt
down beside her bed and prayed. An exultation half-physical, half-spiritual, filled her. When
she rose, her little, thin face was radiant. She seemed to measure the shortness of the work
and woe of the world as between her thumb and finger. The joy of the divine filled all her
longing. When Abby came home, who shared her chamber, she felt no jealousy. She only inquired
whether she had gone quite home with Ellen. "Yes, I did," replied Abby. "I don't think it is
safe for her to go past that lonely place below the Smiths'."

"I'm glad you did," said Maria, with an angelic inflection in her voice.

"Robert Lloyd came to see Ellen, and she ran away over here, and wouldn't see him, because
they had all been plaguing her about him," said Abby. "I wish she wouldn't do so. It would
be a splendid thing for her to marry him, and I know he likes her, and his aunt is going to
send her to college."

"That won't make any difference to Ellen, and everything will be all right anyway, if only
she loved God," said Maria, still with that rapt, angelic voice.

"Shucks!" said Abby. Then she leaned over her sister, caught her by her little, thin shoulders
and shook her tenderly. "There, I didn't mean to speak so," said she. "You're awful good, Maria.
I'm glad you've got religion if it's so much comfort to you. I don't mean to make light of
it, but I'm afraid you ain't well. I'm goin' to get you some more of that tonic to-morrow."

Chapter XXXI

When Ellen reached home that night she found no one there except her father, who was sitting
on the door-step in the north yard. Her mother had gone to see her aunt Eva as soon as the
dressmaker had left. "Who was that with you?" Andrew asked, as she drew near.

"Abby," replied Ellen.

"So you went over there?"

Ellen sat down on a lower step in front of her father. "Yes," said she. She half laughed up
in his face, like a child who knows she has been naughty, yet knows she will not be blamed
since she can count so surely on the indulgent love of the would-be blamer.

"Ellen, your mother didn't like it."

"They had said so many things to me about him that I didn't feel as if I could see him, father,"
she said.

Andrew put a hand on her head. "I know what you mean," he replied, "but they didn't mean any
harm; they're only looking out for your best good, Ellen. You can't always have us; it ain't
in the course of nature, you know, Ellen."

There was a tone of inexorable sadness, the sadness of fate itself in Andrew's voice. He had,
as he spoke, the full realization of that stage of progress which is simply for the next, which
passes to make room for it. He felt his own nothingness. It was the throe of the present before
the future; it was the pang of anticipatory annihilation.

"Don't talk that way, father," said Ellen. "Neither you nor mother are old people."

"Oh, well, it's all right, don't you worry," said Andrew.

"How long did he stay?" asked Ellen. She did not look at her father as she spoke.

"Oh, he didn't stay at all, after they found out you had gone."

Ellen sighed. After a second Andrew sighed also. "It's gettin' late," said he, heavily; "mebbe
we'd better go in before your mother comes, Ellen. Mebbe you'll get cold out here."

"Oh no, I shall not," said Ellen, "and I want to hear about poor Aunt Eva. I don't see what
she is going to do."

"It's a dreadful thing makin' a mistake in marriage," said Andrew.

"Uncle Jim was a good man if he hadn't had such a hard time."

Andrew looked at her, then he spoke impressively. "Look here, Ellen," he said, "you are a good
scholar, and you are smarter in a good many ways than father has ever been, but there's one
thing you want to remember; you want to be sure before you blame the Lord or other men for
a man's goin' wrong, if it ain't his own fault at the bottom of things."

"There's mother," cried Ellen; "there's mother and Amabel. Where's Aunt Eva? Oh, father, what
do you suppose has happened? Why do you suppose mother is bringing Amabel home?"

"I don't know," replied Andrew, in a troubled voice.

He and Ellen rose and hastened forward to meet Fanny and Amabel. The child hung at her aunt's
hand in a curious, limp, disjointed fashion; her little face, even in the half light, showed
ghastly. When she saw Ellen she let go of Fanny's hand and ran to her and threw both her little
arms around her in a fierce clutch as of terror, then she began to sob wildly, "Mamma, mamma,
mamma!"

Fanny leaned her drawn face forward, and whispered to Andrew and Ellen over Amabel's head,
under cover of her sobs, "Hush, don't say anything. She's gone mad, and, and--she tried to--kill
Amabel."

Chapter XXXII

Amabel was a very nervous child, and she was in such terror from her really terrific experience
that she threatened to go into convulsions. Andrew went over for his mother, whom he had always
regarded as an incontestable authority about children. She, after one sharp splutter of wrath
at the whole situation, went to work with the resolution of an old soldier.

"Heat some water, quick," said she to Andrew, "and get me a wash-tub."

Then she told Fanny to brew a mess of sage tea, and began stripping off Amabel's clothes.

"Let me alone! Mamma, mamma, mamma!" shrieked the child. She fought and clawed like a little,
wild animal, but the old woman, in whose arms great strength could still arise for emergencies,
and in whose spirit great strength had never died, got the better of her.

When Amabel's clothing was stripped off, and her little, spare body, which was brown rather
than rosy, although she was a blonde, was revealed, she was as pitiful to see as a wound. Every
nerve and pulse in that tiny frame, about which there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh,
seemed visible. The terrible sensitiveness of the child appeared on the surface. She shrank,
and wailed in a low, monotonous tone like a spent animal overtaken by pursuers. But Mrs. Zelotes
put her in the tub of warm water, and held her down, though Amabel's face, emerging from it,
had the expression of a wild thing.

"There, you keep still!" said she, and her voice was tender enough, though the decision of
it could have moved an army.

When Amabel had had her hot bath, and had drunk her sage tea by compulsory gulps, and been
tucked into Ellen's bed, her childhood reasserted itself. Gradually her body and her bodily
needs gained the ascendancy over the unnatural strain of her mind. She fell asleep, and lay
like one dead. Then Ellen crept down-stairs, though it was almost midnight, where her father
and mother and grandmother were still talking over the matter. Fanny seemed almost as bad as
her sister. It was evident that there was in the undisciplined Loud family a dangerous strain
if too far pressed. She was lying down on the lounge, with Andrew holding her hand.

"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Poor Eva!" she kept repeating.

Then she threw off Andrew's hand, sprang to her feet, and began to walk the room.

"She'll be as bad as her sister if she keeps on," said Mrs. Zelotes, quite audibly, but Fanny
paid no attention to that.

"What is goin' to be done? Oh, my God, what is goin' to be done?" she wailed. "There she is
locked up with two men watchin' her lest she do herself a harm, and it's got to cost eighteen
dollars a week, unless she's put in with the State poor, and then nobody knows how she'll be
treated. Oh, poor Eva, poor Eva! Albert Riggs told me there were awful things done with the
State poor in the asylums. He's been an attendant in one. He says we've got to pay eighteen
dollars a week if we want to have her cared for decently, and where's the money comin' from?"
Fanny raised her voice higher still.

"Where's the money comin' from?" she demanded, with an impious inflection. It was as if she
questioned that which is outside of, and the source of, life. Everything with this woman, whose
whole existence had been bound and tainted by the need of money, resolved itself into that
fundamental question. All her woes hinged upon it; even her misery was deteriorated by mammon.

"Where's the money comin' from?" she demanded again. "There's Jim gone, and all his mother's
got is that little, mortgaged place, and she feeble, and there ain't a cent anywhere, unless--"
She turned fiercely to Andrew, clutching him hard by the arm.

"You must take every cent of that money out of the savings-bank," she cried, "every cent of
it. I'm your wife, and I've been a good wife to you, you can't say I haven't."

"Yes, of course you have, poor girl! Don't, don't!" said Andrew, soothingly. He was very pale,
and shook from head to foot as he tried to calm Fanny.

"Yes, I've been a good, faithful wife," Fanny went on, in her high, hysterical voice. "Even
your mother can't say that I haven't; and Eva is my own sister, and you ought to help her.
Every cent of that money will have to come out of the savings-bank, and the house here will
have to be mortgaged; it's only my due. I would do as much for you if it was your sister. Eva
ain't goin' to suffer."

"I guess if you mortgage this house that you had from your father, to keep a woman whose husband
has gone off and left her," said Mrs. Zelotes, "I guess if you don't go and get him back, and
get the law to tackle him!"

Then Fanny turned on her. "Don't you say a word," said she. "My sister ain't goin' to suffer,
I don't care where the money comes from. It's mine as much as Andrew's. I've half supported
the family myself sewin' on wrappers, and I've got a right to have my say. My sister ain't
goin' to suffer! Oh, my God, what's goin' to become of her? Poor Eva, poor Eva! Eighteen dollars
a week; that's as much as Andrew ever earned. Oh, it was awful, it was awful! There, when I
got in there, she had a--knife, the--carving knife, and she had Amabel's hair all gathered
up in one hand, and her head tipped back, and poor old mother Tenny was holding her arms, and
screamin', and it was all I could do to get the knife away," and Fanny stripped up her sleeves,
and showed a glancing cut on her arm.

"She did that before I got it away from her," she said. "Think of it, my own sister! My own
sister, who always thought so much of me, and would have had her own fingers cut to the bone
before she would have let any one touch me or Ellen! Oh, poor Eva, poor Eva! What is goin'
to become of her, what is goin' to become of her?"

Mrs. Zelotes went out of the house with a jerk of angry decision, and presently returned with
a bottle half full of whiskey.

"Here," said she to Ellen, "you pour out a quarter of a tumbler of this, and fill it up with
hot water. I ain't goin' to have the whole family in an asylum because Jim Tenny has run off
with another woman, if I can help it!"

The old woman's steady force of will asserted itself over the hysterical nature of her daughter-in-law.
Fanny drank the whiskey and water and went to bed, half stupefied, and Mrs. Zelotes went home.

"You ring the bell in the night if she's taken worse, and I'll come over," said she to her son.

When Ellen and her father were left alone they looked at each other, each with pity for the
other. Andrew laid a tender, trembling hand on the girl's shoulder. "Somehow it will all come
out right," he whispered. "You go to bed and go to sleep, and if Amabel wakes up and makes
any trouble you speak to father."

"Don't worry about me, father," returned Ellen. "It's you who have the most to worry over."
Then she added--for the canker of need of money was eating her soul, too--"Father, what is
going to be done? You can't pay all that for poor Aunt Eva. How much money have you got in
the bank?"

"Not much, not much, Ellen," replied Andrew, with a groan.

"It wouldn't last very long at eighteen dollars a week?"

"No, no."

"It doesn't seem as if you ought to mortgage the house when you and mother are getting older.
Father--"

"What, Ellen?"

"Nothing," said Ellen, after a little pause. It had been on her lips to tell him that she must
go to work, then she refrained. There was something in her father's face which forbade her
doing so.

"Go to bed, Ellen, and get rested," said Andrew. Then he rubbed his head against hers with
his curious, dog-like method of caress, and kissed her forehead.

"You go to sleep and get rested yourself, father," said Ellen.

"I guess I won't undress to-night, but I'll lay on the lounge," said Andrew.

"Well, you speak to me if mother wakes up and takes on again. Maybe I can do something."

"All right, dear child," said Andrew, lovingly and wearily. He had a look as if some mighty
wind had passed over him and he were beaten down under it, except for that one single uprearing
of love which no tempest could fairly down.

Ellen went up-stairs, and lay down beside poor little Amabel without undressing herself. The
child stirred, but not to awake, when she settled down beside her, and reached over her poor
little claw of a hand to the girl, who clasped it fervently, and slipped a protecting arm under
the tiny shoulders. Then the little thing nestled close to Ellen, with a movement of desperate
seeking for protection. "There, there, darling, Ellen will take care of you," whispered Ellen.
But Amabel did not hear.

Chapter XXXIII

The next afternoon poor Eva Tenny was carried away, and Andrew accompanied the doctor who had
her in charge, as being the only available male relative. As he dressed himself in his Sunday
suit, he was aware--to such pitiful passes had financial straits brought him--of a certain
self-congratulation, that he would not be at home when the dressmaker asked for money that
night, and that no one would expect him to go to the bank under such circumstances. But Andrew,
in his petty consideration as to personal benefit from such dire calamity, reckoned without
another narrow traveller. Miss Higgins stopped him as he was going out of the door, looking
as if bound to a funeral in his shabby Sunday black, with his solemn, sad face under his well-brushed
hat.

"I hate to say anything when you're in such trouble, Mr. Brewster," said she, "but I do need
the money to pay a bill, and I was wondering if you could leave what was due me yesterday,
and what will be due me to-day."

But Fanny came with a rush to Andrew's relief. She was in that state of nervous tension that
she was fairly dangerous if irritated. "Look here, Miss Higgins," said she. "We hesitated a
good deal about havin' you come here to-day, anyway. Ellen wanted to send you word not to.
We are in such awful trouble, that she said it didn't seem right for her to be thinkin' about
new clothes, but I told her she'd got to have the things if she was going to college, and so
we decided to have you come, but we 'ain't had any time nor any heart to think of money. We've
got plenty to pay you in the bank, but my husband 'ain't had any time to go there this mornin',
what with seein' the doctor, and gettin' the certificate for my poor sister, and all I've got
to say is: if you're so dreadful afraid as all this comes to, that you have to lose all sense
of decency, and dun folks so hard, in such trouble as we be, you can put on your things and
go jest as quick as you have a mind to, and I'll get Miss Patch to finish the work. I've been
more than half a mind to have her, anyway. I was very strongly advised to. Lots of folks have
talked to me against your fittin', but I've always had you, and I thought I'd give you the
chance. Now if you don't want it, you jest pack up and go, and the quicker the better. You
shall have your pay as soon as Mr. Brewster can get round after he has carried my poor sister
to the asylum. You needn't worry."  Fanny said the last with a sarcasm which seemed to reach
out with a lash of bitterness like a whip. The other woman winced, her eyes were hard, but
her voice was appeasing.

"Now, I didn't think you'd take it so, Mrs. Brewster, or I wouldn't have said anything," she
almost wheedled. "You know I ain't afraid of not gettin' my pay, I--"

"You'd better not be," said Fanny.

"Of course I ain't. I know Mr. Brewster has steady work, and I know your folks have got money."

"We've got money enough not to be beholden to anybody," said Fanny. "Andrew, you'd better be
goin' along or you'll be late."

Andrew went out of the yard with his head bent miserably. He had felt ashamed of his fear,
he felt still more ashamed of his relief. He wondered, going down the street, if it might not
be a happier lot to lose one's wits like poor Eva, rather than have them to the full responsibility
of steering one's self through such straits of misery.

"I hope you won't think I meant any harm," the dressmaker said to Fanny, quite humbly.

There was that about the sister of another woman who was being carried off to an insane asylum
which was fairly intimidating.

Miss Higgins sewed meekly during the remainder of the day, having all the time a wary eye upon
Fanny. She went home before supper, urging a headache as an excuse. She was in reality afraid
of Fanny.

Andrew was inexpressibly relieved when he reached home to find that the dressmaker was gone,
and Fanny, having sent Amabel to bed, was chiefly anxious to know how her sister had reached
the asylum. It was not until the latter part of the evening that she brought up the subject
of the bank. "Do look out to-morrow, Andrew Brewster, and be sure to take that money out of
the bank to pay Miss Higgins," she said. "As for being dunned again by that woman, I won't!
It's the last time I'll ever have her, anyway. As far as that is concerned, all the money will
have to come out of the bank if poor Eva is to be kept where she is. How much money was there
that she had?"

"Just fifty-two dollars and seventy cents," replied Andrew. "Jim had left a little that he'd
scraped together somehow, with the letter he wrote to her, and he told her if he had work he'd
send her more."

"I'd die before I'd touch it," said Fanny, fiercely. Then she looked at Andrew with sudden
pity. "Poor old man," she said; "it's mighty hard on you when you're gettin' older, and you
never say a word to complain. But I don't see any other way than to take that money, do you?"

"No," said Andrew.

"And you don't think I'm hard to ask it, Andrew?"

"No."

"God knows if it was your sister and my money, I would take every dollar. You know I would,
Andrew."

"Yes, I know," replied Andrew, hoarsely.

"Mebbe she'll get better before it's quite gone," said Fanny. "You say the doctor gave some hope?"

"Yes, he did, if she was taken proper care of."

"Well, she shall be. I'll go out and steal before she sha'n't have proper care. Poor Eva!"
Fanny burst into the hysterical wailing which had shaken her from head to foot at intervals
during the last twenty-four hours. Andrew shuddered, thinking that he detected in her cries
a resemblance to her sister's ravings. "Don't, don't, Fanny," he pleaded. "Don't, poor girl."
He put his arm around her, and she wept on his shoulder, but with less abandon. "After all,
we've got each other, and we've got Ellen, haven't we, Andrew?" she sobbed.

"Yes, thank God," said Andrew. "Don't, Fanny."

"That--that's more than money, more than all the wages for all the labor in the world, and
that we've got, haven't we, Andrew? We've got what comes to us direct from God, haven't we?
Don't think I'm silly, Andrew--haven't we?"

"Yes, yes, we have--you are right, Fanny," replied Andrew.

"I guess I am, too," she assented, looking up in Andrew's poor, worn face with eyes of sudden
bravery. "We'll get along somehow--don't you worry, old man. I guess we'll come out all right,
somehow. We'll use that money in the bank as far as it goes, and then I guess some way will
be opened."

Then there came over Andrew's exaltation, to which Fanny's words had spurred his flagging spirit,
a damper of utter mortification and guilt. He felt that he could bear this no longer. He opened
his mouth to tell her what he had done with the money in the bank, when there came a knock
on the door, and Fanny fled into the bedroom. She had unfastened her dress, and her face was
stained with tears. She shut the bedroom door tightly as Andrew opened the outer one.

The man who had loaned him the money to buy Ellen's watch stood there. His name was William
Evarts, and he worked in the stitching-room of McGuire's factory, in which Andrew was employed.
He was reported well-to-do, and to have amassed considerable money from judicious expenditures
of his savings, and to be strictly honest, but hard in his dealings. He was regarded with a
covert disfavor by his fellow-workmen, as if he were one of themselves who had somehow elevated
himself to a superior height by virtue of their backs. If William Evarts had acquired prosperity
through gambling in mines, they would have had none of that feeling; they would have recognized
the legitimacy of luck in the conduct of affairs. He was in a way a reproach to them. "Why
can't you get along and save as well as William Evarts?" many a man's monitor asked of him.
"He doesn't earn any more than you do, and has had as many expenses in his family."  The man
not being able to answer the question to his own credit, disliked William Evarts who had instigated
it.

Andrew, who had in his character a vein of sterling justice, yet felt that he almost hated
William Evarts as he stood there before him, small and spare, snapping as it were with energy
like electric wires, the strong lines in his clean-shaven face evident in the glare of the
street-lamp.

"Good-evening," Andrew said, and he spoke like a criminal before a judge, and at that moment
he felt like one.

"Good-evening," responded the other man. Then he added, in a hushed voice at first, for he
had fineness to appreciate a sort of indecency in dunning, in asking a man for even his rightful
due, and he had a regard for possible listening ears of femininity, "I was passing by, and
I thought I'd call and see if it was convenient for you to pay me that money."

"I'm sorry," Andrew responded, with utter subjection. He looked and felt ignoble. "I haven't
got it, Evarts."

"When are you going to have it?" asked the other, in a slightly raised, ominous voice.

"Just as soon as I can possibly get it," replied Andrew, softly and piteously. Ellen's chamber
was directly overhead. He thought of the possibility of her overhearing.

"Look at here, Andrew Brewster," said the other man, and this time with brutal, pitiless force.
When it came to the prospect of losing money he became as merciless as a machine. Something
diabolical in remorselessness seemed to come to the surface, and reveal wheels of grinding
for his fellow-men. "Look at here," he said, "I want to know right out, and no dodging. Have
you got the money to pay me--yes or no?"

"No," said Andrew then, with a manliness born of desperation. He had the feeling of one who
will die fighting. He wished that Evarts would speak lower on account of Ellen, but he was
prepared to face even that. The man's speech came with the gliddering rush of an electric car;
it was a concentration of words into one intensity of meaning; he elided everything possible,
he ran all his words together. He spoke something in this wise: "GoddamnyouAndrewBrewster,
for comin'to borrow money to buy your girl a watch when you had nothin' to pay for't with,
whatbusinesshadyourgirlwithawatchanyhow,I'dliket'know? My girl'ain'tgotno watch. I'veputmymoneyinthebank.
It'srobbery. I'llhavethelawonye. I'llsueyou. I'll--"

At that moment something happened. The man, William Evarts, who was talking with a vociferousness
which seemed cutting and lacerating to the ear, who was brandishing an arm for emphasis in
a circle of frenzy, fairly jumped to one side. The girl, Ellen Brewster, in a light wrapper,
which she had thrown over her night-gown, came with such a speed down the stairs which led
to the entry directly before the door, that she seemed to be flying. White ruffles eddied around
her little feet, her golden hair was floating out like a flag. She came close to William Evarts.
"Will you please not speak so loud," said she, in a voice which her father had never heard
from her lips before. It was a voice of pure command, and of command which carried with it
the consciousness of power to enforce. She stood before William Evarts, and her fine smallness
seemed intensified by her spirit to magnificence. The man shrank back a little, he had the
impression as of some one overtowering him, and yet the girl came scarcely to his shoulder.
"Please do not speak so loud, you will wake Amabel," she said, and Evarts muttered, like a
dog under a whip, that he didn't want to wake her up.

"You must not," said Ellen. "Now here is the watch and chain. I suppose that will do as well
as your money if you cannot afford to wait for my father to pay you. My father will pay you
in time. He has never borrowed anything of any man which he has not meant to pay back, and
will not pay back. If you cannot afford to wait, take the watch and chain."

The man looked at her stupefied.

"Here," said Ellen; "take it."

"I don't want your watch an' chain," muttered Evarts.

"You have either got to take them or wait for your money," said Ellen.

"I'll wait," said Evarts. He was looking at the girl's face with mingled sentiments of pity,
admiration, and terror.

"Very well, then," said Ellen. "I will promise you, and my father will, that you shall have
your money in time, but how long do you want to wait?"

"I'll wait any time. I ain't in any straits for the money, if I get it in the end," said Evarts.

"You will get it in the end," said Ellen. Evarts turned to Andrew.

"Look here, give me your note for six months," said he, "and we'll call it all right."

"All right," said Andrew, again.

"If you are not satisfied with that," said Ellen, with a tone as if she were conferring inestimable
benefits, so proud it was, "you can take the watch and chain. It is not hurt in the least.
Here."  She was fairly insolent. Evarts regarded her with a mixture of admiration and terror.
He told somebody the next day that Andrew Brewster had a stepper of a daughter, but he did
not give his reasons for the statement. He had a sense of honor, and he had been in love with
a girl as young before he married his wife, who had been a widow older than he, worth ten thousand
dollars from her first husband. He could no more have taken the girl's watch and chain than
he would have killed her.

"I'm quite satisfied," he replied to her, making a repellant motion towards the watch and dangling
chain glittering in the electric-light.

"Very well, then," said Ellen, and she threw the chain over her neck.

"You just bring that I O U to the shop to-mor-mor," said Evarts to Andrew; then, with a "Good-evening,"
he was off. They heard him hail an electric-car passing, and that, although he never took a
car, but walked to save the fare. He had been often heard to say that he for one did not support
the street railroad.

After he had gone, Ellen turned to her father, and flung a silent white arm slipping from her
sleeve loose around his neck, and pulled his head to her shoulder. "Now look here, father,"
she said, "you've been through lots to-day, and you'd better go to bed and go to sleep. I don't
think mother was waked up--if she had been, she would have been out here."

"Look here, Ellen, I want to tell you," Andrew began, pitifully. He was catching his breath
like a child with sobs.

"I don't want to hear anything," replied Ellen, firmly. "Whatever you did was right, father."

"I ought to tell you, Ellen!"

"You ought to tell me nothing," said Ellen. "You are all tired out, father. You can't do anything
that isn't right for me. Now go to bed and go to sleep."

Ellen stroked her father's thin gray hair with exactly the same tender touch with which he
had so often stroked her golden locks. It was an inheritance of love reverting to its original
source. She kissed him on his lined forehead with her flower-like lips, then she pushed him
gently away. "Go softly, and don't wake mother," whispered she; "and, father, there's no need
to trouble her with this. Good-night."

Chapter XXXIV

Ellen's deepest emotion was pity for her father, so intense that it was actual physical pain.

"Poor father! Poor father! He had to borrow the money to buy me my watch and chain," she kept
repeating to herself. "Poor father!"

To her New England mind, borrowing seemed almost like robbing. She actually felt as if her
father had committed a crime for love of her, but all she looked at was the love, not the guilt.
Suddenly a conviction which fairly benumbed her came over her--the money in the savings-bank;
that little hoard, which had been to the imagination of herself and her mother a sheet-anchor
against poverty, must be gone. "Father must have used if for something unbeknown to mother,"
she said to herself--"he must, else he would not have told Mr. Evarts that he could not pay
him."  It was a hot night, but the girl shivered as she realized for the first time the meaning
of the wolf at the door. "All we've got left is this house--this house and--and--our hands,"
thought Ellen. She saw before her her father's poor, worn hands, her mother's thin, tired hands,
jerking the thread in and out of those shameful wrappers; then she looked at her own, as yet
untouched by toil, as white and small and fair as flowers. She thought of the four years before
her at college, four years before she could earn anything--and in the mean time? She looked
at the pile of her school-books on the table. She had been studying hard all summer. The thirst
for knowledge was as intense in her as the thirst for stimulants in a drunkard.

"I ought to give up going to college, and go to work in the shop," Ellen said to herself, and
she said it as one might drive a probing-knife into a sore. "I ought to," she repeated. And
yet she was far from resolving to give up college. She began to argue with herself the expediancy,
supposing that the money in the bank was gone, of putting a mortgage on the house. If her father
continued to have work, they might get along and pay for her aunt, who might, as the doctor
had said, not be obliged to remain long in the asylum if properly cared for. Would it not,
after all, be better, since by a course at college she would be fitted to command a larger
salary than she could in any other way. "I can support them all," reflected Ellen. At that
time the thought of Robert Lloyd, and that awakening of heart which he had brought to pass,
were in abeyance. Old powers had asserted themselves. This love for her own blood and their
need came between her and this new love, half of the senses, half of the spirit.

Amabel waked up in the early sultry dawn of the summer day with the bewilderment of one in
a new world. She stared at the walls of the room, at the shaft of sunlight streaming in the
window, then at Ellen.

"Where am I?" she inquired, in a loud, querulous plaint. Then she remembered, but she did not
cry; instead, her little face took on a painfully old look.

"You are here with cousin Ellen, darling, don't you know?" Ellen replied, leaning over her,
and kissing her.

Amabel wriggled impatiently away, and faced to the wall. "Yes, I know," said she.

That morning Amabel would not eat any breakfast, and Fanny suggested that Ellen take her for
a ride on the street-cars. "We can get along without you for an hour," she whispered, "and
I am afraid that child will be sick."

So Ellen and Amabel set out, leaving Fanny and the dressmaker at work, and when they were returning
past the factories the noon whistles were blowing and the operatives were streaming forth.

Ellen was surprised to see her father among them as the car swept past. He walked down the
street towards home, his dinner-bag dangling at his side, his back more bent than ever.

She wondered uneasily if her father was ill, for he never went home to dinner. She looked back
at him as the car swept past, but he did not seem to see her. He walked with an air of seeing
nothing, covering the ground like an old dog with some patient, dumb end in view, heeding nothing
by the way. It puzzled her also that her father had come out of Lloyd's instead of McGuire's,
where he had been employed all summer. Ellen, after she reached home, watched anxiously for
her father to come into the yard, but she did not see him. She assisted about the dinner, which
was a little extra on account of the dressmaker, and all the time she glanced with covert anxiety
at the window, but her father did not pass it. Finally, when she went out to the pump for a
pitcher of water, she set the pitcher down, and sped to the orchard like a wild thing. A suspicion
had seized her that her father was there.

Sure enough, there he was, but instead of lying face down on the grass, as he had done before,
he was sitting back against a tree. He had the air of having settled into such a long lease
of despair that he had sought the most comfortable position for it. His face was ghastly. He
looked at Ellen as she drew near, and opened his mouth as if to speak, but instead he only
caught his breath. He stared hard at her, then he closed his eyes as if not to see her, and
motioned her away with one hand with an inarticulate noise in his throat.

But Ellen sat down beside him. She caught his two hands and looked at him. "Father, look at
me," said she, and Andrew opened his eyes. The expression in them was dreadful, compounded
of shame and despair and dread, but the girl's met them with a sort of glad triumph and strength
of love. "Now look here, father," she said, "you tell me all about it. I didn't want to know
last night. Now I want to know. What is the matter?"

Andrew continued to look at her, then all at once he spoke with a kind of hoarse shout. "I'm
discharged! I'm discharged," he said, "from McGuire's; they've got a boy who can move faster
in my place--a boy for less pay, who can move faster. I hurried over to Lloyd's to see if they
would take me on again; I've always thought I should get back into Lloyd's, and I saw the foreman,
and he told me to my face that I was too old, that they wanted younger men. And I went into
the office to see Lloyd, pushed past the foreman, with him damning me, and I saw Lloyd."

"Was young Mr. Lloyd there?" asked Ellen, with white lips.

"No; I guess he had gone to dinner. And Lloyd looked at me, and I believe he counted every
gray hair in my head, and he saw my back, and he saw my hands, and he said--he said I was too old."

Andrew snatched his hands from Ellen's grasp, pressed them to his face, and broke into weeping.
"Oh, my God, I'm too old, I'm too old!" he sobbed; "I'm out of it! I'm too old!"

Ellen regarded him, and her face had developed lines of strength hitherto unrevealed. There
was no pity in it, hardly love; she looked angry and powerful. "Father, stop doing so, and
look at me," she said. She dragged her father's hands from his face, and he stared at her with
his inflamed eyes, half terrified, half sustained. At that moment he realized a strength of
support as from his own lost youth, a strength as of eternal progress which was more to be
relied upon than other human strength. For the first time he leaned on his child, and realized
with wonder the surety of the stay.

"Now, father, you stop doing so," said Ellen. "You can get work somewhere; you are not old.
Call yourself old! It is nonsense. Are you going to give in and be old because two men tell
you that you are? What if your hair is gray! Ever so many young men have gray hair. You are
not old, and you can get work somewhere. McGuire's and Lloyd's are not the only factories in
the country."

"That ain't all," said Andrew, with eyes like a beseeching dog's on her face.

"I know that isn't all," said Ellen. "You needn't be afraid to tell me, father. You have taken
the money out of the savings-bank for something."

Again Andrew would have snatched his hands from the girl's and hidden his face, but she held
them fast. "Yes, I have," he admitted, in a croaking voice.

"Well, what if you have?" asked Ellen. "You had a right to take it out, didn't you? You put
it in. I don't know of anybody who had a better right to take it out than you, if you wanted to."

Andrew stared at her, as if he did not hear rightly. "You don't know what I did with it, Ellen,"
he stammered.

"It is nobody's business," replied Ellen. She had an unexplained sensation as if she were holding
fast to her father's slipping self-respect which was dragging hard at her restraining love.

"I put it in a worthless gold-mine out in Colorado--the same one your uncle Jim lost his money
in," groaned Andrew.

"Well, it was your money, and you had a perfect right to," said Ellen. "Of course you thought
the mine was all right or you wouldn't have put the money into it."

"God knows I did."

"Well, the best business men in the world make mistakes. It is nobody's business whether you
took the money out or not, or what you used it for, father."

"I don't see how the bills are going to be paid, and there's your poor aunt," said Andrew.
He was leaning more and more heavily upon this new tower of strength, this tender little girl
whom he had hitherto shielded and supported. The beautiful law of reverse of nature had come
into force.

Ellen set her mouth firmly. "Don't you worry, father," said she. "We will think of some way
out of it. There's a little money to pay for Aunt Eva, and maybe she won't be sick long. Does
mother know, father?"

"She don't know about anything, Ellen," replied Andrew, wretchedly.

"I know she doesn't know about your getting thrown out of work--but about the bank?"

"No, Ellen."

Ellen rose. "You stay here, where it is cool, till I ring the dinner-bell, father," she said.

"I don't want any dinner, child."

"Yes, you do, father. If you don't eat your dinner you will be sick. You come when the bell rings."

Andrew knew that he should obey, as he saw the girl's light dress disappear among the trees.

Ellen went back to the pump, and carried her pitcher of water into the house. Her mother met
her at the door. "Where have you been all this time, Ellen Brewster?" she asked, in a high
voice. "Everything is getting as cold as a stone."

Ellen caught her mother's arm and drew her into the kitchen, and closed the door. Fanny turned
pale as death and looked at her. "Well, what has happened now?" she said. "Is your father killed?"

"No," said Ellen, "but he is out of work, and he can't get a job at Lloyd's, and he took all
that money out of the savings-bank a long time ago, and put it into that gold-mine that Uncle
Jim lost in."

Fanny clutched the girl's arm in a grasp so hard that it left a blue mark on the tender flesh.
She looked at her, but did not speak one word.

"Now, mother," said Ellen, "you must not say one word to father to scold him. He's got enough
to bear as it is."

Fanny pushed her away with sudden fierceness. "I guess I don't need to have my own daughter
teach me my duty to my husband," said she. "Where is he?"

"Down in the orchard."

"Well, ring the bell for dinner loud, so he can hear it."

When Andrew came shuffling wearily up from the orchard, Fanny met him at the corner of the
house, out of sight from the windows. She was flushed and perspiring, clad in a coarse cotton
wrapper, revealing all her unkempt curves. She went close to him, and thrust one large arm
through his. "Look here, Andrew," said she, in the tenderest voice he had ever heard from her,
a voice so tender that it was furious, "you needn't say one word. What's done's done. We shall
get along somehow. I ain't afraid. Come in and eat your dinner!"

The dressmaking work went on as usual after dinner. Andrew had disappeared, going down the
road towards the shop. He tried for a job at Briggs's, with no success, then drifted to the
corner grocery.

Ellen sat until nearly three o'clock sewing. Then she went up-stairs and got her hat, and went
secretly out of the back door, through the west yard, that her mother should not see her. However,
her grandmother called after her, and wanted to know where she was going.

"Down street, on an errand," answered Ellen.

"Well, keep on the shady side," called her grandmother, thinking the girl was bound to the
stores for some dressmaking supplies.

That night Miss Higgins did not ask for her pay; she had made up her mind to wait until her
week was finished. She went away after supper, and Ellen followed her to the door. "We won't
want you to-morrow, Miss Higgins," said she, "and here is your pay."  With that she handed
a roll of bills to the woman, who stared at her in amazement and growing resentment.

"If my work ain't satisfactory," said she--

"Your work is satisfactory," said Ellen, "but I don't want any more work done. I am not going
to college."

There was something conclusive and intimidating about Ellen's look and tone. The dressmaker,
who had been accustomed to regard her as a child, stared at her with awe, as before a sudden
revelation of force. Then she took her money, and went down the walk.

When Ellen re-entered the sitting-room her father and mother, who had overheard every word,
confronted her.

"Ellen Brewster, what does this mean?"

Andrew looked as if he would presently fall to the floor.

"It means," said Ellen--and she looked at her parents with the brave enthusiasm of a soldier
on her beautiful face--she even laughed--"it means that I am going to work--I have got a job
in Lloyd's."

When Ellen made that announcement, her mother did a strange thing. She ran swiftly to a corner
of the room, and stood there, staring at the girl, with back hugged close to the intersection
of the walls, as if she would withdraw as far as possible from some threatening ill. At that
moment she looked alarmingly like her sister; there was something about Fanny in her corner,
calculated, when all circumstances were taken into consideration, to make one's blood chill,
but Andrew did not look at her. He was intent upon Ellen, and the facing of the worst agony
of his life, and Ellen was intent upon him. She loved her mother, but the fear as to her father's
suffering moved her more than her mother's. She was more like her father, and could better
estimate his pain under stress. Andrew rose to his feet and stood looking at Ellen, and she
at him. She tried to meet the drawn misery and incredulousness of his face with a laugh of
reassurance.

"Yes, I've got a job in Lloyd's," said she. "What's the matter, father?"

Then Andrew made an almost inarticulate response; it sounded like a croak in an unknown tongue.

Ellen continued to look at him, and to laugh.

"Now look here, father," said she. "There is no need for you and mother to feel bad over this.
I have thought it all over, and I have made up my mind. I have got a good high-school education
now, and the four years I should have to spend at Vassar I could do nothing at all. There is
awful need of money here, and not only for us, but for Aunt Eva and Amabel."

"You sha'n't do it!" Andrew burst out then, in a great shout of rage. "I'll mortgage the house--that'll
last awhile. You sha'n't, I say! You are my child, and you've got to listen. You sha'n't, I say!"

"Now, father," responded Ellen's voice, which seemed to have in it a wonderful tone of firmness
against which his agonized vociferousness broke as against a rock, "this is nonsense. You must
not mortgage the house. The house is all you have got for your and mother's old age. Do you
think I could go to college, and let you give up the house in order to keep me there? And as
for grandma Brewster, you know what's hers is hers as long as she lives--we don't want to think
of that. I have got this job now, which is only three dollars a week, but in a year the foreman
said I might earn fifteen or eighteen, if I was quick and smart, and I will be quick and smart.
It is the best thing for us all, father."

"You sha'n't!" shouted Andrew. "I say you sha'n't!"

Suddenly Andrew sank into a chair, his head lopped, he kept moving a hand before his eyes,
as if he were brushing away cobwebs. Then Fanny came out of her corner.

"Get the camphor, quick!" she said to Ellen. "I dun'no' but you've killed your father."

Fanny held her husband's head against her shoulder, and rubbed his hands frantically. The awful
strained look had gone from her face. Ellen came with the camphor, and then went for water.
Fanny rubbed Andrew's forehead with the camphor, and held the bottle to his nose. "Smell it,
Andrew," she said, in a voice of ineffable tenderness and pity. Ellen returned with a glass
of water, and Andrew swallowed a little obediently. Finally he made out to stagger into the
bedroom with Fanny's and Ellen's assistance. He sat down weakly on the bed, and Fanny lifted
his legs up. Then he sank and closed his eyes as if he were spent. In fact, he was. At that
moment of Ellen's announcement some vital energy in him suddenly relaxed like overstrained
rubber. His face, sunken in the pillow, was both ghastly and meek. It was the face of a man
who could fight no more. Ellen knelt down beside him, sobbing.

"Oh, father!" she sobbed, "I think it is for the best. Dear father, you won't feel bad."

"No," said Andrew, faintly. There was a slight twitching in his hand, as if he wished to put
it on her head, then it lay thin and inert on the coverlid. He tried to smile, but his face
settled into that look of utter acquiescence of fate.

"I s'pose it's the best you can do," he muttered.

"Have you told Miss Lennox?" gasped Fanny.

"Yes."

"What did she say?"

"She was sorry, but she made no objection," replied Ellen, evasively.

Fanny came forward abruptly, caught up the camphor-bottle, and began bathing Andrew's forehead
again.

"We won't say any more about it," said she, in a harsh voice. "You'd better go over to your
grandma Brewster's and see if she has got any whiskey. I think your father needs to take something."

"I don't want anything," said Andrew, feebly.

"Yes, you do, too, you are as white as a sheet. Go over and ask her, Ellen."

Ellen ran across the yard to her grandmother's, and the old woman met her at the door. She
seemed to have an instinctive knowledge of trouble.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"Father's a little faint, and mother wants me to borrow the whiskey," said Ellen. She had not
at that time the courage to tell her grandmother what she had done.

Mrs. Zelotes ran into the house, and came out with the bottle.

"I'm comin' over," she announced. "I'm kind of worried about your father; he 'ain't looked
well for some time. I wonder what made him faint. Maybe he ate something which hurt him."

Ellen said nothing. She fled up-stairs to her chamber, as her grandmother entered the bedroom.
She felt cowardly, but she thought that she would let her mother tell the news.

She sat down and waited. She knew that presently she would hear the old woman's voice at the
foot of the stairs. She was resolved upon her course, and knew that she could not be shaken
in it, yet she dreaded unspeakably the outburst of grief and anger which she knew would come
from her grandmother. She felt as if she had faced two fires, and now before the third she
quailed a little.

It was not long before the expected summons came.

"Ellen--Ellen Brewster, come down here!"

Ellen went down. Her grandmother met her at the foot of the stairs. She was trembling from
head to foot; her mouth twisted and wavered as if she had the palsy.

"Look here, Ellen Brewster, this ain't true?" she stammered.

"Yes, grandma," answered Ellen. "I have thought it all over, and it is the only thing for me
to do."

Her grandmother clutched her arm, and the girl felt as if she were in the grasp of another
will, which was more conclusive than steel.

"You sha'n't!" she said, whispering, lest Andrew should hear, but with intense force.

"I've got to, grandma. We've got to have the money."

"The money," said the old woman, with an inflection of voice and a twist of her features indicative
of the most superb scorn--"the money! I guess you ain't goin' to lose such a chance as that
for money. I guess I've got two hundred and ten dollars a year income, and I'll give up a half
of that, and Andrew can put a mortgage on the house, if that Tenny woman has got to be supported
because her husband has run off and left her and her young one. You sha'n't go to work in a shop."

"I've got to, grandma," said Ellen.

The old woman looked at her. It was like a duel between two strong wills of an old race. "You
sha'n't," she said.

"Yes, I shall, grandma."

Then the old woman turned upon her in a fury of rage.

"You're a Loud all over, Ellen Brewster," said she. "You 'ain't got a mite of Brewster about
you. You 'ain't got any pride! You'd just as soon settle down and work in a shop as do anything
else."

Fanny pushed before her. "Look here, Mother Brewster," said she, "you can just stop! Ellen
is my daughter, and you 'ain't any right to talk to her this way. I won't have it. If anybody
is goin' to blame her, it's me."

"Who be you?" said Mrs. Zelotes, sniffing.

Then she looked at them both, at Ellen and at her mother.

"If you go an' do what you've planned," said she to Ellen, "an' if you uphold her in it," to
Fanny, "I've done with you."

"Good riddance," said Fanny, coarsely.

"I ain't goin' to forget that you said that," cried Mrs. Zelotes. She held up her dress high
in front and went out of the door. "I ain't comin' over here again, an' I'll thank you to stay
at home," said she. Then she went away.

Soon after Fanny heard Ellen in the dining-room setting the table for supper, and went out.

"Where did you get that money you paid the dressmaker with?" she asked, abruptly.

"I borrowed it of Abby," replied Ellen.

"Then she knows?"

"Yes."

Fanny continued to look at Ellen with the look of one who is settling down with resignation
under some knife of agony.

"Well," said she, "there's no need to talk any more about it before your father. Now I guess
you had better toast him some bread for his supper."

"Yes, I will," replied Ellen. She looked at her mother pitifully, and yet with that firmness
which had seemed to suddenly develop in her. "You know it is the best thing for me to do, mother?"
she said, and although she put it in the form of a question, the statement was commanding in
its assertiveness.

"When are you--goin' to work?" asked Fanny.

"Next Monday," replied Ellen.

Chapter XXXV

When Ellen had gone to the factory to apply for work neither of the Lloyds were in the office,
only a girl at the desk, whom she knew slightly. Ellen had hesitated a little as she approached
the girl, who looked around with a friendly smile.

"I want to see--" Ellen began, then she stopped, for she did not exactly know for whom she
should ask. The girl, who was blond and trim, clad coquettishly in a blue shirt-waist and a
duck skirt, with a large, cheap rhinestone pin confining the loop of her yellow braids, looked
at her in some bewilderment. She had heard of Ellen's good-fortune, and knew she was to be
sent to Vassar by Cynthia Lennox. She did not dream that she had come to ask for employment.

"You want to see Mr. Lloyd?" she asked.

"Oh no!" replied Ellen.

"Mr. Robert Lloyd?"  The girl, whose name was Nellie Stone, laughed a little meaningly as she
said that.

Ellen blushed. "No," she said. "I think I want to see the foreman."

"Which foreman?"

"I don't know," replied Ellen. "I want to get work if I can. I don't know which foreman I ought
to see."

"To get work?" repeated the girl, with a subtle change in her manner.

"Yes," said Ellen. She could hear her heart beat, but she looked at the other girl's pretty,
common face with the most perfect calmness.

"Mr. Flynn is the one you want to see, then," said the girl. "You know Ed Flynn, don't you?"

"A little," replied Ellen. He had been a big boy when she entered the high-school, and had
left the next spring.

"Well, he's the one you want," said Nellie Stone. Then she raised her voice to a shrill peal
as a boy passed the office door.

"Here, you, Jack," said she, "ask Mr. Flynn to come here a minute, will you?"

"He don't want to see you," replied the boy, who was small and spare, laden heavily with a
great roll of wrapping paper borne bayonet fashion over his shoulder. His round, impish face
grinned back at the girl at the desk.

"Quit your impudence," she returned, half laughing herself. "I don't want to see him; it is
this young lady here; hurry up."

The boy gave a comprehensive glance at Ellen. "Guess he'll come," he called back.

Flynn appeared soon. He was handsome, well shaven and shorn, and he held himself smartly. He
also dressed well in a business suit which would not have disgraced the Lloyds. His face lit
up with astonishment and pleasure when he saw Ellen. He bowed and greeted her in a rich voice.
He was of Irish descent but American born. Both his motions and his speech were adorned with
flourishes of grace which betrayed his race. He placed a chair for Ellen with a sweep which
would have been a credit to the stage. All his actions had a slight exaggeration as of fresco
painting, which seemed to fit them for a stage rather than a room, and for an audience rather
than chance spectators.

"No, thank you," replied Ellen. Then she went straight to the matter in hand. "I have called
to see if I could get a job here?" she said. She had been formulating her speech all the way
thither. Her first impulse was to ask for employment, but she was sure as to the manner in
which a girl would ordinarily couch such a request. So she asked for a job.

Flynn stared at her. "A job?" he repeated.

"Yes, I want very much to get one," replied Ellen. "I thought there might be a vacancy."

"Why, I thought--" said the young man. He was very much astonished, but his natural polish
could rise above astonishment. Instead of blurting out what was in his mind as to her change
of prospects, he reasoned with incredible swiftness that the change must be a hard thing to
this girl, and that she was to be handled the more tenderly and delicately because she was
such a pretty girl. He became twice as polite as before. He moved the chair nearer to her.

"Please sit down," he said. He handed to her the wooden arm-chair as if it had been a throne.
Nellie Stone bent frowning over her day-book.

"Now let me see," said the young man, seriously, with perfect deference of manner, only belied
by the rollicking admiration in his eyes. "You have never held a position in a factory before,
I think?"

"No," replied Ellen.

"There is at present only one vacancy that I can think of," said Flynn, "and that does not
pay very much, but there is always a chance to rise for a smart hand. I am sure you will be
that," he added, smiling at her.

Ellen did not return the smile. "I shall be contented to begin for a little, if there is a
chance to rise," she said.

"There's a chance to rise to eighteen dollars a week," said Flynn. He smiled again, but it
was like smiling at seriousness itself. "Bantingism," to be effective, must be most closely followed,
when, unfortunately also, it proves extremely debilitating; it is
suitable only for sturdy, hard riding gluttons of the Squire Western
type.

The patient rapidly loses strength as well as flesh, and speedily
acquires an unconquerable repugnance to the dietary.

Further, from a strictly physiological point of view, the quantity of meat is greatly in excess,
while with the cessation of the regimen, the fat quickly reappears.

Next Ebstein formulated a dietary that is certainly much better tolerated than that of Harvey and Banting,
and yields as good, or even better, results. He allows patients to take a definite quantity--two
to two and a half ounces-of fat daily, in the form of bacon or butter
which, theoretically at least, offers several advantages: It diminishes
the sensations of hunger and thirst, and plays a special role with
respect to the albuminoids; the latter may thus be assimilated by
the economy without being resolved into fat, and thus the adipose
of the organism at this period is drawn upon without subsequent renewal.

The following is the outline:

Breakfast.--At 6 a.m. in summer; 7:30 in winter:--Eight ounces of
black tea without either milk or sugar; two ounces of white bread
or toast, with a copious layer of butter.

Dinner.--2 p.m.:--A modicum of beef marrow soup; four ounces of meat,
preferably of fatty character; moderate quantity of vegetable, especially
the legumines, but no potatoes or anything containing starch; raw
fruits in season, and cooked fruits (stewed, without sugar); two or
three glasses of light wine as a beverage, and after eating, a cup
of black tea without sugar.

Supper.--7:30 p m.:--An egg, bit of fat roast, ham, or bacon; a slice of white bread well buttered;
a large cup of black tea without milk or sugar; from time to time,
cheese and fresh fruits.

Germain See suggests as a modification of this regimen, the abundant use of beverage, the addition
of gelatins, and at times small doses of potassium iodide in twenty cases he claims constant and
relatively prompt results.

Whatever may be urged for Ebstein's system--and it has afforded most
excellent results to Unna and to Lube, as well as its author--it certainly
exposes the patient to the terrors of dyspepsia, when the routine
must needs be interrupted or modified; hence it is not always to be
depended upon.

As between dyspepsia and obesity, there are few, I fancy, who would
not prefer the latter.

Another "system" that has acquired no little celebrity, and which has for its aim the reduction
as far as possible of alimentary hydrocarbons while permitting a certain proportion of fat, is that,
of Denneth, which necessarily follows somewhat closely the lines laid down by Ebstein.

Oertels' treatment, somewhat widely known, and not without due measure
of fame, is based upon a series of measures having as object the withdrawal
from both circulation and the economy at large, as much of the fluids
as possible.

It is especially adapted for the relief of those obese who are suffering fatty degeneration of the
heart. The menu is as follows:

Breakfast.--Pour to five ounces of tea or coffee with a little milk; two to two and a half ounces bread.

Dinner.--Three
or four ounces of roast or boiled meat, or moderately fat food; fish,
slightly fat; salad and vegetables at pleasure; one and a half ounces
of bread (in certain cases as much as three ounces of farinaceous
food may be permitted); three to six ounces of fruit; at times a little
pastry for dessert.--In summer, if fruit is not obtainable, six to
eight ounces of light wine may be allowed.

Tea,--A cupful (four to five ounces) of tea or coffee, with a trifle of milk, as at breakfast;
one and three-fourths ounces of bread; and exceptionally (and at
most) six ounces of water.

Supper.--One to two soft boiled eggs; four or five ounces of meat;
one and three fourths ounces of bread; a trifle of cheese, salad,
or fruit; six to eight ounces of light wine diluted with an eighth
volume of water.

The quantity of beverage may be slightly augmented at each meal if necessary, especially if
there is no morbid heart trouble.

Schwenninger (Bismarck's physician), who opened a large sanitarium near Berlin a few years since
for the treatment of the obese, employs Oertel's treatment, modified in that an abundance of
beverage is permitted, provided it is not indulged in at meals; it
is forbidden until two hours after eating.

Both Oertel's and Schwenninger's methods have procured grave dyspepsias,
and fatal albuminurias as well, according to Meyer and Rosenfield.

It has been charged the allowance of beverage upon which Schwenninger lays so much stress in the
treatment at his sanitarium has a pecuniary basis, in other words a commission upon the sale of
wines.[2]

[Footnote 2: The sanitarium is owned by a stock company, Schwenninger being merely Medical Director.--ED.]

Thus,
it will be observed that while some forbid beverage, others rather
insist upon its employment in greater or less quantities.

Under such circumstances, it would seem but rational, before undertaking to relieve obesity, to
establish its exact nature, and also the role taken by fluids in the phenomena of nutrition.

Physiologists generally admit water facilitates nutritive exchanges, which is explained by the elimination
of a large quantity of urine; the experiments of Genth and Robin
in this direction appear conclusive.

Bischoff, Voit, and Hermann have shown that water increases, not alone
 the elimination of urine, but also of sodium chloride, phosphoric
acid, etc. Grigoriantz observed augmentation of disintegration when
the quantity of beverage exceeded forty-six to eighty ounces ("1,400
to 2,400 cubic centimeters") per diem.

Oppenheim, Fraenkel, and Debove, while believing water has but little influence upon the exchanges,
admit it certainly need not diminish the latter; and Debove and Flament,
after administering water in quantities varying from two to eight
pints per diem, concluded that urine was diminished below the former
figure, while above the latter it increased somewhat, being dependent
upon the amount ingested.

It was on the strength of the foregoing that Lallemand declared water
to have no influence upon the exchanges.

The results claimed by Oppenheim, Debove, et al. were immediately challenged--and it is now
generally admitted, not without some justice--by Germain See. It seems certain, to say the least,
that water taken during the repast does tend to augment the quantity
and facilitate the elimination of urine.

Abundance of beverage, moreover, presents other advantages, in that it facilitates digestion
by reason of its diluent action, a fact well worth bearing in mind when treating the obese
who are possessed of gouty diathesis, and whose kidneys are accordingly encumbered with uric
and oxalic acids. The foregoing presents the ground upon which Germain See permits an abundance
of beverage; but he also expresses strong reservation as regards beer and alcohol, either of
which (more especially the former) tends to the production of adipose. In his opinion, the
only beverage of the alcoholic class that is at all permissible, and then only for cases suffering
from fatty heart, is a little liqueur or diluted wine.

Coffee and tea he commends highly, and recommends the ingestion of large quantities at high temperature,
both during the repasts and their intervals. Coffee in large doses is undoubtedly a means of
de-nutrition, and so, too, in no less extent, is tea; both act vigorously
owing to the contained alkaloids, though, to be sure, they sometimes,
at first, tend to insomnia and palpitation, to which no attention
need be paid, however.

The treatment outlined by See is:

1.

A physiological regimen comprising four to five ounces of nitrogenous principles as derived from
eight to ten ounces animal muscle and albuminates; three to six ounces of fat; eight to ten ounces
of hydrocarbons as yielded by ten to twelve ounces of sugar or starch food.

These proportions to be modified in such manner that the musculo-albuminates shall not sensibly
exceed the normal ratio, for meat in excess itself furnishes fat during transformation. The fatty
substances of easy digestion may, without inconvenience, be utilized in doses of two to three ounces.
The hydrocarbons should be reduced to a minimum. As for the herbaceous elements, they contain
nothing nutritive.

2. Beverage, far from being suppressed, should be augmented, in order to facilitate stomachal digestion
and promote general nutrition, though alcoholic liquids must be inhibited; likewise mineral
waters, except, perhaps, for occasional use. Both should be replaced by infusions of coffee
or tea, taken as hot as can be drank.

Henrich Kisch insists that any method which promises rapid and marked decrease of adipose must,
per se, be objectionable, even if not positively injurious, since
it tends to provoke general troubles of nutrition.

He suggests that first the fats and hydrocarbons be reduced as little
as possible; that a moderate mixed regimen is required, containing
a preponderance of albumen, small quantities of hydrocarbons and gelatinous
matters, with but very little fat.

Certain fatty meats, however, should be generally interdicted, such
as pork sausage, smoked beef tongue, goose breast, smoked ham, fat
salmon, and herring in any form.

Eggs, however, may be partaken of in moderation, giving preference to the albumen over the
yelk. Farinaceous foods, in the main, should be rejected, even bread being allowed only in
small quantities, and then preferably in the form of toast. Cheese likewise contains too much
fat; and mushrooms are so rich in hydrocarbons that they should be
rejected.

Condiments, water, vegetable acids (vinegars excepted) may be permitted; especially pernicious
is vinegar where there is any tendency to gout or gravel. All fatty beverages--bouillon, unskimmed
milk, chocolate, or cacao--and all alcoholics, are hurtful; breakfast tea is undoubtedly the best
beverage, but, after a little, is advantageously replaced by light white wine diluted with water.

Kisch
believes in a free and abundant use of water by the obese, especially where there is a tendency
to plethora, since this fluid facilitates oxidation as the result of absorption; thus he advocates
the inhibition of large quantities of cold water by all, save those
presenting evidence of cardiac insufficiency.

In short, his regimen is based upon the administration of a large quantity of albumen, like
that of Harvey-Banting.

E. Munk recommends an almost identical dietary, save that he prefers great moderation in fluids
employed as beverage.

M. Robin has sought to harmonize the opposing views regarding fluids,
and therefore declares obesity arises from two distinct sources: 1.

Augmentation of assimilation. 2. Reduced disassimilation.

In the former, he insists water must be interdicted, while in the
latter it may be allowed ad libitum.

Again, in order to recognize the exact variety of obesity, he divides his patients into three
classes, each recognizable by the volume of urea excreted. In the first there is an increase
above normal; in the second the volume of urea is stationary; in
the third decreased, increased, or stationary.

When the urea is stationary, which is most frequently the case, it
is necessary to calculate the coefficient of oxidation; that is, the
relation existing between the solid matters of the urine and the urea.

The elevation of the coefficient is prima facie evidence the obesity is due to excess of assimilation,
while depression of the coefficient indicates default of assimilation.

In the first case, water and liquids must be denied as far as possible, the same as if there was no
augmentation of urea; in the second, the same as if there was diminution
of urea, the patients may be permitted to imbibe fluids at pleasure.

For the obese from default of disassimilation, Robin recommends a
regimen of green vegetables and bread chiefly--the latter in small
quantities, however, and fluids as may be desired.

By this means, on one occasion, he was able in the course of one
month to diminish the weight of a female patient by twelve and a half
pounds, her measurement around the waist at the same time decreasing
5.2 inches and across the stomach 4.8 inches.

M. De St. Germain achieved good results by combining judicious exercise with moderate alimentation,
excluding wine and bread.

M. Dujardin Beaumetz, who professes to have given most close and careful
study and attention to regimen for the obese, outlines the following,
provided there is no evidence of fatty degeneration of heart.

Breakfast (at 8 a. m.)--Three-fourths of an ounce of bread "en flute"--that
is abounding with crust; one and a half ounces of cold meat, ham or
beef, six ounces weak black tea, sans sugar.

Lunch (at 1 p.m.)--An ounce and a half to two ounces of bread, or a ragout, or two eggs; three
ounces green vegetables; one-half ounce of cheese; fruits at discretion.

Dinner (at 7 p.m.)--An ounce and a half to two ounces of bread; three to four ounces of meat, or
ragout; ditto of green vegetables, salad, half an ounce of cheese,
fruit ad libitum.

At meal times the patient may take only a "glass and a half" of liquid--approximately
ten ounces--though a greater amount may be permitted if he abstains
during the intervals.

Special alimentary regimen, however, does not constitute the sole treatment of obesity. Concurrently
must be employed a number of practical adjuvants which are oftentimes
of the utmost assistance.

For one thing, exercise is indispensable; all authorities agree on this point. The exercise
taken in the gymnasium is one of the best, notably the "wall exercise,"
which is more particularly suited to those afflicted with pendulous
and protuberant abdomens as the result of feebleness of the hypogastric
muscles, to accumulation of fat under the skin and in the omentum,
and to dilation of the stomach and intestines.

In the "wall exercise," the patient stands erect against an absolutely
straight and plumb wall, lifts his hands (carrying a weight) straight
over the head, and causes them to describe a semicircle forward.

Zantz particularly insists upon arm and leg exercise for the obese, especially the former,
since with the same amount of effort a larger amount of oxygen is consumed than is possible by
the latter.

However, of whatever character, the exercise should be continued to the point of fatigue or dyspnoea--three
thousand movements daily, gradually increased to twenty-five thousand, if the system can bear
it; and under such conditions, not only is there consumption of hydrocarbons,
but there is provided a veritable greed for air that augments waste.

The experiments of Oertel indicate that loss of weight due to fatiguing exercise arises more
particularly from dehydration, which is made good by absorption of the fluids employed as
beverage; the fluids are claimed by Germain See to act as accelerants
of oxidation.

During exercise there is obviously more abundant absorption of oxygen,
and consequently greater elimination of carbonic acid, and as a consequence
(as shown by researches of Voit), the reserve fat of the economy is
attacked and diminished; in intense labor there is an average hourly
consumption of about 8.2 percent. of fat.

Further physical activity is useful in exercising the voluntary muscles,
and thus opposing the invasion by interstitial fat of the muscle fibrils.

Extreme exercise also, to a certain degree, exerts a favorable influence
on the cardiac muscle, augmenting both its nutrition and its capacity
for labor.

With the anæmic obese, however, it is necessary to be most circumspect
in prescribing forced exercise; also with the elderly obese possessed
of enfeebled or fatty heart.

Hydrotherapy, especially in the form of cold douches, particularly when combined with massage,
is often of considerable value in relieving obesity; the method of Harmman, of St. Germain,
which has in many instances induced rapid loss of adipose, is of
this class.

Tepid saline baths and vapor baths have many advocates, and may afford
material aid when the heart and circulation do not inhibit their employment.

Hot baths elevate the temperature of the body and increase the organic exchanges, hence, as Bert
and Reynard have pointed out, tend to the elimination of oxygen and
carbonic acid; but when employed, the patient should be introduced
while the temperature is below 130° F., when it may be gradually raised
in the course of thirty or forty minutes to 140° F.

It has already
been intimated, the chief feature of the treatment of obesity is acceleration
of the exchanges; and this is in the main true, though it must also
be borne in mind that, while there are obese who excrete little urea
and have a depressed central nervous temperature, many may be azoturic,
and besides eliminate phosphate in excess, when an oxidating treatment
will not only fail, but prove positively injurious.

The bile throws out fat, therefore, to accelerate nutritive oxidations,
the liver and nervous system must be acted upon, i.e., stimulated.

Everything that tends to diminish the activity of the former, or depress the latter, must
be avoided.

Hence intellectual labor should be encouraged, or in lieu thereof,
travel advised.

Exercise should be taken chiefly while fasting; the limits of sleep confined to strict necessity,
and siestas after meals and during the day strictly forbidden; the
skin stimulated by hydro-therapeutic measures, including massage under
cold affusions, during warm salt baths, etc.

To increase the activity
of the liver, salicylate of soda may often be advantageously administered
for its cholagogue effect; or resort may be had to saline purgatives
such as are afforded by the springs of Marienbad, Kissengen, Homburg,
Carlsbad, Brides, Hunyadi, or Chatel-Guyon; and it is somewhat remarkable
that while undergoing a course of these waters, there is often no
appreciable change in weight or obesity, though the decrease becomes
most marked almost immediately upon cessation of treatment.



Ellen was thankful that Robert Lloyd had not spoken to her in the factory, and yet she was
cut to the quick by it. It fulfilled her anticipations to the letter. "I was right," she said
to herself; "he can never think of me again. He is showing it."  Somehow, after he had passed,
her enthusiasm, born of a strong imagination, and her breadth of nature failed her somewhat.
The individual began to press too closely upon the aggregate. Suddenly Ellen Brewster and her
own heartache and longing came to the front. She had put herself out of his life as completely
as if she had gone to another planet. Still, feeling this, she realized no degradation of herself
as a cause of it. She realized that from his point of view she had gone into a valley, but
from hers she was rather on an opposite height. She on the height of labor, of skilled handiwork,
which is the manifestation in action of brain-work, he on the height of pure brain-work unpressed
by physical action.

At noon, when she was eating her dinner with Abby and Maria, Abby turned to her and inquired
if young Mr. Lloyd had spoken to her when he came through the room.

"No, he didn't," replied Ellen.

Abby said nothing, but she compressed her lips and gave her head a hard jerk. A girl who ran
a machine next to Abby's came up, munching a large piece of pie, taking clean semicircular
bites with her large, white teeth.

"Say," she said, "did you see the young boss's new suit? Got up fine, wasn't he?"

"I'd like to see him working where I be for an hour," said a young fellow, strolling up, dipping
into his dinner-bag. He was black and greasy as to face and hands and clothing. "Guess his
light pants and vest would look rather different," said he, and everybody laughed except the
Atkins girls and Ellen.

"I guess he washed his hands, anyway, before he ate his dinner," said Abby, sharply, looking
at the young man's hands with meaning.

The young fellow colored, though he laughed. "There ain't a knife in this shop so sharp as
some women's tongues," said he. "I pity the man that gets you."

"There won't be any man get me," retorted Abby. "I've seen all I want to see of men, working
with 'em every day."

"Mebbe they have of you," called back the young fellow, going away.

"The saucy thing!" said the girl who stitched next to Abby.

"There isn't any excuse for a man's eating his dinner with hands like that," said Abby. "It's
worse to poison yourself with your own dirt than with other folks'. It hurts your own self more."

"He ain't worth minding," said the girl.

"Do you suppose I do mind him?" returned Abby. Maria looked at her meaningly. The young man,
whose name was Edison Bartlett, had once tried to court Abby, but neither she nor Maria had
ever told of it.

"His clothes were a pearl gray," said the girl at the stitching-machine, reverting to the original
subject.

"Good gracious, who cares what color they were?" cried Abby, impatiently.

"He looked awful handsome in 'em," said the girl. "He's awful handsome."

"You'd better look at handsome fellows in your own set, Sadie Peel," said Abby, roughly.

The girl, who was extremely pretty, carried herself well, and dressed with cheap fastidiousness,
colored.

"I don't see what we have to think about sets for," said she. "I guess way back the Peels were
as good as the Lloyds. We're in a free country, where one is as good as another, ain't we?"

"No one is as good as another, except in the sight of the Lord, in any country on the face
of this earth," said Abby.

"If you are as good in your own sight, I don't see that it makes much difference about the
sight of other human beings," said Ellen. "I guess that's what makes a republic, anyway."

Sadie Peel gave a long, bewildered look at her, then she turned to Abby.

"Do you know where I can get somebody to do accordion-plaiting for me?" she asked.

"No," said Abby. "I never expect to get to the height of accordion-plaiting."

"I know where you can," said another girl, coming up. She had light hair, falling in a harsh,
uncurled bristle over her forehead; her black gown was smeared with paste, and even her face
and hands were sticky with it.

"There's a great splash of paste on your nose, Hattie Wright," said Abby.

The girl took out a crumpled handkerchief and began rubbing her nose absently while she went
on talking about the accordion-plaiting.

"There's a woman on Joy Street does it," said she. "She lives just opposite the school-house,
and she does it awful cheap, only three cents a yard."  She thrust the handkerchief into her
pocket.

"You haven't got it half off," said Abby.

"Let it stay there, then," said the girl, indifferently. "If you work pasting linings in a
shoe-shop you've got to get pasted yourself."

Ellen looked at the girl with a curious reflection that she spoke the truth, that she really
was pasted herself, that the soil and the grind of her labor were wearing on her soul. She
had seen this girl out of the shop--in fact, only the day before--and no one would have known
her for the same person. When her light hair was curled, and she was prettily dressed, she
was quite a beauty. In the shop she was a slattern, and seemed to go down under the wheels
of her toil.

"On Joy Street, you said?" said Sadie Peel.

"Yes. Right opposite the school-house. Her name is Brackett."

Then the one-o'clock whistle blew, and everybody, Ellen with the rest, went back to their stations.
Robert Lloyd did not come into the room again that afternoon. Ellen worked on steadily, and
gained swiftness. Every now and then the foreman came and spoke encouragingly to her.

"Look out, Mamie," he said to the girl at her side, "or she'll get ahead of you."

"I don't want to get ahead of her," said Ellen, unexpectedly.

Flynn laughed. "If you don't, you ain't much like the other girls in this shop," said he, passing
on with his urbane, slightly important swing of shoulders.

"Did you mean that?" asked Mamie Brady.

"Yes, I did. It seems to me you work fast enough for any girl. A girl isn't a machine."

"You're a queer thing," said Mamie Brady. "If I were you, I would just as soon get ahead as
not, especially if Ed Flynn was goin' to come and praise me for it."

Ellen shrugged her shoulders and tied another knot.

"You're a queer thing," said Mamie Brady, while her fingers flew like live wires.

Chapter XXXVI

That night, when Ellen went down the street towards home with the stream of factory operatives,
she computed that she must have earned about fifty cents, perhaps not quite that. She was horribly
tired. Although the work in itself was not laborious, she had been all day under a severe nervous
tension.

"You look tired to death, Ellen Brewster," Abby said, in a half-resentful, half-compassionate
tone. "You can never stand this in the world."

"I am no more tired than any one would be the first day," Ellen returned, stoutly, "and I'm
going to stand it."

"You act to me as if you liked it," said Abby, with an angry switch like a cat.

"I do," Ellen returned, almost as angrily. Then she turned to Abby. "Look here, Abby Atkins,
why can't you treat me half-way decent?" said she. "You know I've got to do it, and I'm making
the best of it. If anybody else treated me the way you are doing, I don't know what you would do."

"I would kill them," said Abby, fiercely; "but it's different with me. I'm mad to have you
go to work in the shop, and act as if you liked it, because I think so much of you."  Abby
and Ellen were walking side by side, and Maria followed with Sadie Peel.

"Well, I can't help it if you are mad at me," said Ellen. "I've had everything to contend against,
my father and mother, and my grandmother won't even speak to me, and now if you--"  Ellen's
voice broke.

Abby caught her arm in a hard grip.

"I ain't," said she; "you can depend on me. You know you can, in spite of everything. You know
why I talk so. If you've set your heart on doing it, I won't say another word. I'll do all
I can to help you, and I'd like to hear anybody say a word against you for going to work in
the shop, that's all."

Ellen and Abby almost never kissed each other; Abby was not given to endearments of that kind.
Maria was more profuse with her caresses. That night when they reached the corner of the cross
street where the Atkinses lived, Maria went close to Ellen and put up her face.

"Good-night," said she. Then she withdrew her lips suddenly, before Ellen could touch them.

"I forgot," said she. "You mustn't kiss me. I forgot my cough. They say it's catching."

Ellen caught hold of her little, thin shoulders, held her firmly, and kissed her full on her lips.

"Good-night," said she.

"Good-night, Ellen," called Abby, and her sharp voice rang as sweet as a bird's.

When Ellen came in sight of her grandmother's house, she saw a window-shade go down with a
jerk, and knew that Mrs. Zelotes had been watching for her, and was determined not to let her
know it. Mrs. Pointdexter came out of her grand house as Ellen passed, and took up her station
on the corner to wait for a car. She bowed to Ellen with an evasive, little, sidewise bow.
Her natural amiability prompted her to shake hands with her, call her "my dear," and inquire
how she had got on during her first day in the factory, but she was afraid of her friend, whose
eye she felt upon her around the edge of the drawn curtain.

It was unusually dark that night for early fall, and the rain came down in a steady drizzle,
as it had come all day, and the wind blew from the ocean on the east. The lamp was lighted
in the kitchen when Ellen turned into her own door-yard, and home had never looked so pleasant
and desirable to her. For the first time in her life she knew what it was to come home for
rest and shelter after a day of toil, and she seemed to sense the full meaning of home as a
refuge for weary labor.

When she opened the door, she smelled at once a particular kind of stew of which she was very
fond, and knew that her mother had been making it for her supper. There was a rush of warm
air from the kitchen which felt grateful after the damp chill outside.

Ellen went into the kitchen, and her mother stood there over the stove, stirring the stew.
She looked up at the girl with an expression of intense motherliness which was beyond a smile.

"Well, so you've got home?" she said.

"Yes."

"How did you get along?"

"All right. It isn't hard work. Not a bit hard, mother."

"Ain't you tired?"

"Oh, a little. But no more than anybody would be at first. I don't look very tired, do I?"
Ellen laughed.

"No, you don't," said Fanny, looking at her cheeks, reddened with the damp wind. The mother's
look was admiring and piteous and brave. No one knew how the woman had suffered that day, but
she had kept her head and heart above it. The stew for Ellen's supper was a proof of that.

"Where's father?" asked Ellen, taking off her hat and cape, and going to the sink to wash her
face and hands. Fanny saw her do that with a qualm. Ellen had always used a dainty little set
in her own room. Now she was doing exactly as her father had always done on his return from
the shop--washing off the stains of leather at the kitchen sink. She felt instinctively that
Ellen did it purposely, that she was striving to bring herself into accord with her new life
in all the details.

Little Amabel came running out of the dining-room, and threw her arms around Ellen's knees
as she was bending over the sink. "I've set the table!" she cried.

"Look out or you'll get all splashed," laughed Ellen.

"And I dusted," said Amabel.

"She's been as good as a kitten all day, and a sight of help," said Fanny.

"She's a good girl," said Ellen. "Cousin Ellen will kiss her as soon as she gets her face washed."

She caught hold of a fold of the roller towel, and turned her beautiful, dripping face to her
mother as she did so.

"That stew does smell so good," said she. "Where did you say father was?"

"I thought we'd just have some bread and milk for dinner, and somethin' hearty to-night, when
you came home," said Fanny. "I thought maybe a stew would taste good."

"I guess it will," said Ellen, stooping down to kiss Amabel. "Where did you say father was?"

"Uncle Andrew has been lyin' down all day most," whispered Amabel.

"Isn't he well?" Ellen asked her mother, in quick alarm.

"Oh yes, he's well enough."  Fanny moved close to the girl with a motion of secrecy. "If I
were you I wouldn't say one word about the shop, nor what you did, before father to-night;
let him kind of get used to it. Amabel mustn't talk about it, either."

"I won't," said Amabel, with a wise air.

"You know father had set his heart on somethin' pretty different for you," said Fanny.

Fanny hushed her voice as Andrew came out of the dining-room, staggering a little as if the
light blinded him. His nervous strength of the morning had passed and left him exhausted. He
moved and stood with a downward lope of every muscle, expressing unutterable patience, which
had passed beyond rebellion and questioning.

He stood before Ellen like some old, spent horse. He was expecting to hear something about
the shop--expecting, as it were, a touch on a sore, and he waited for it meekly.

Ellen turned her lovely, glowing face towards him.

"Father," she said, as if nothing out of the common had happened, "are you going down-town
to-night?"

Andrew brightened a little. "I can if you want anything, Ellen," he said.

"Well, I don't want you to go on purpose, but I do want a book from the library."

"I'd just as soon go as not, Ellen," said Andrew.

"It'll do him good," whispered Fanny, as she passed Ellen, carrying the dish of stew to the
dining-room.

"Well, then, I'll give you my card after supper," said Ellen. "Supper is ready now, isn't it,
mother? I'm as hungry as a bear."

Andrew, when he was seated at the table and was ladling out the stew, had still that air of
hopeless and defenceless apology towards life, but he held his head higher, and his frown of
patient gloom had relaxed.

Then Ellen said something else. "Maybe I can write a book some time," said she.

A sudden flash illumined Andrew's face. It was like the visible awakening of hope and ambition.

"I don't see why you can't," he said, eagerly.

"Maybe she can," said Fanny. "Give her some more of the potatoes, Andrew."

"I'll have plenty of time after--evenings," said Ellen.

"I guess lots of folks write books that sell, and sell well, that don't have any more talent
than you," said Andrew. "Only think how they praised your valedictory."

"Well, it can't do any harm to try," said Ellen, "and you could copy it for me, couldn't you,
father? Your writing is so fine, it would be as good as a typewriter."

"Of course I can," said Andrew.

When Andrew went down to the library, passing along the drenched streets, seeing the lamps
through shifting veils of heavy mist, he was as full of enthusiasm over Ellen's book as he
had been over the gold-mine. The heart of a man is always ready to admit a ray of sunshine,
and it takes only a small one to dispel the shadows when love dwells therein.

Chapter XXXVII

Ellen actually went to work, with sheets of foolscap and a new bottle of ink, on a novel, which
was not worth the writing; but no one could estimate the comfort and encouragement it was to
Andrew. Ellen worked an hour or two every evening on the novel, and next day Andrew copied
it in a hand like copperplate--large, with ornate flourishes. Andrew's handwriting had always
been greatly admired, and, strangely enough, it was not in the least indicative of his character,
being wholly acquired. He had probably some ability for drawing, but this had been his only outlet.

At the head of every chapter of Ellen's novel were birds and flowers done in colored inks,
and every chapter had a tail-piece of elegant quirls and flourishes. Fanny admired it intensely.
She was not quite so sure of Ellen's work as she was of her husband's. She felt herself a judge
of one, but not of the other.

"If Ellen could only write as well as you copy, it will do," she often said to Andrew.

"What she is writing is beautiful," said Andrew, fervently. He was quite sure in his own mind
that such a book had never been written, and his pride in his decorations was a minor one.

Ellen, although she was not versed in the ways of books, yet had enough of a sense of the fitness
of things, and of the ridiculous, to know that the manuscript, with its impossible pen-and-ink
birds and flowers heading and finishing every chapter, was grotesque in the extreme. She felt
divided between a desire to laugh and a desire to cry whenever she looked at it. About her
own work she felt more than doubtful; still, she was somewhat hopeful, since her taste and
judgment, as well as her style, were alike crude. She told Abby and Maria what she was doing,
under promise of strict secrecy, and after a while read them a few chapters.

"It's beautiful," said Maria--"perfectly beautiful. I had a Sunday-school book this week which
I know wasn't half as good."

Ellen looked at Abby, who was silent. The three girls were up in Ellen's room. It was midwinter,
some months after she had gone to work in the shop, and she had a fire in her little, air-tight
stove.

"Well, what do you think of it, Abby?" asked Ellen. Ellen's cheeks were flushed as if with
fever. She looked eagerly at the other girl.

"Do you want me to tell you the truth?" asked Abby, bluntly.

"Yes, of course I do."

"Well, then, I don't know a thing about books, and I'd knock anybody else down that said it,
but it seems to me it's trash."

"Oh, Abby," murmured Maria.

"Never mind," said Ellen, though she quivered a little, "I want to know just how it looks to her."

"It looks to me just like that," said Abby--"like trash. It sounds as if, when you began to
write it, you had mounted upon stilts, and didn't see things and people the way they really
were. It ain't natural."

"Do you think I had better give it up, then?" asked Ellen.

"No, I don't, on account of your father."

"I believe it would about break father's heart," said Ellen.

"I don't know but it's worth as much to write a book for your father, to please him, and keep
his spirits up, as it is to write one for the whole world," said Abby.

"Only, of course, she can't get any money for it," said Maria. "But I don't believe Abby is
right, and don't you get discouraged, Ellen. It sounds beautiful to me."

"Well, I suppose it is worth keeping on with for father's sake," said Ellen; but she had a
discouraged air. She never again wrote with any hope or heart; she had faith in Abby's opinion,
for she knew that she was always predisposed to admiration in her case.

Ellen at that time was earning more, for she had advanced, and had long ago left her station
beside Mamie Brady; and now in a month or two she would have a machine. The girls, many of
them, said openly that her rapid promotion was due to favoritism, and that Ed Flynn wouldn't
do as much for anybody but Ellen Brewster. Flynn hung about her in the shop a good deal, but
he had made no efforts to pay her decided attention. His religion was the prime factor for
his hesitation. He could not see his way clear towards open addresses with a view to marriage.
Still, he had a sharp eye for other admirers, and Ellen had not been in the factory two months
before Granville Joy was sent into another room. Robert Lloyd, to whom the foreman appealed
for confirmation of the plan, coincided with readiness.

"That fellow ain't strong enough to run that machine he's doing now," said Flynn.

"Then put him on another," Robert said, coloring. It was not quite like setting his rival in
the front of the battle; still, he felt ashamed of himself. Quicker than lightning it had flashed
through his mind that young Joy could thus be sent into a separate room from Ellen Brewster.

"I think he had better take one of the heel-shaving machines below," said Flynn, "and let that
big Swede, that's as strong as an ox, and never jumped at anything in his life, take his place
here."

"All right," said Lloyd, assuming a nonchalant air. "Make the change if you think it advisable,
Flynn."

While such benevolence towards a possible rival had its suspicious points, yet there was, after
all, some reason for it. Granville Joy, who was delicately organized as to his nerves, was
running a machine for cutting linings, and this came down with sharp thuds which shook the
factory, and it was fairly torture to him. Every time the knife fell he cringed as if at a
cannon report. He had never grown accustomed to it. His face had acquired a fixed expression
of being screwed to meet a shock of sound. He was manifestly unfit for his job, but he received
the order to leave with dismay.

"Hasn't my work been satisfactory?" he asked Flynn.

"Satisfactory enough," replied the foreman, genially, "but it's too hard for you, man."

"I 'ain't complained," said Joy, with a flash of his eyes. He thought he knew why this solicitude
was shown him.

"I know you 'ain't," said Flynn, "but you 'ain't got the muscle and nerve for it. That's plain
enough to see."

"I 'ain't complained, and I'd rather stay where I be," said Joy, angrily.

"You'll go where you are sent in this factory, or be damned," cried Flynn, walking off.

Joy looked after him with an expression which transformed his face. But the next morning the
stolid Swede, who would not have started at a bomb, was at his place, and he was below, where
he could not see Ellen.

Robert never spoke to Ellen in the factory, and had never called upon her since she entered.
Now and then he met her on the street and raised his hat, that was all. Still, he began to
wonder more and more if his aunt had not been mistaken in her view of the girl's motive for
giving up college and going to work. Then, later on, he learned from Lyman Risley that a small
mortgage had been put on the Brewster house some time before. In fact, Andrew, not knowing
to whom to go, and remembering his kindness when Ellen was a child, had applied to him for
advice concerning it. "He had to do it to keep his wife's sister in the asylum," he told Robert;
"and that poor girl went to work because she was forced into it, not because she preferred
it, you may be sure of that."

The two men were walking down the street one wind-swept day in December, when the pavement
showed ridges of dust as from a mighty broom, and travellers walked bending before it with
backward-flying garments.

"You may be right," said Robert; "still, as Aunt Cynthia says, so many girls have that idea
of earning money instead of going to school."

"I know the pitiful need of money has tainted many poor girls with a monstrous and morbid overvalue
of it," said Risley, "and for that I cannot see they are to blame; but in this case I am sure
it was not so. That poor child gave up Vassar College and went to work because she was fairly
forced into it by circumstances. The aunt's husband ran away with another woman, and left her
destitute, so that the support of her and her child came upon the Brewsters; and Brewster has
been out of work a long time now, I know. He told me so. That mortgage had to be raised, and
the girl had to go to work; there was no other way out of it."

"Why didn't she tell Aunt Cynthia so?" asked Robert.

"Because she is Ellen Brewster, the outgrowth of the child who would not--"  Risley checked
himself abruptly.

"I know," said Robert, shortly.

The other man started. "How long have you known--she did not tell?"

Robert laughed a little. "Oh no," he replied. "Nobody told. I went there to call, and saw my
own old doll sitting in a little chair in a corner of the parlor. She did not tell, but she
knew that I knew. That child was a trump."

"Well, what can you expect of a girl who was a child like that?" said Risley. "Mind you, in
a way I don't like it. This power for secretiveness and this rigidity of pride in a girl of
that age strike me rather unpleasantly. Of course she was too proud to tell Cynthia the true
reason, and very likely thought they would blame her father, or Cynthia might feel that she
was in a measure hinting to her to do more."

"It would have looked like that," said Robert, reflecting.

"Without any doubt that was what she thought; still, I don't like this strength in so young
a girl. She will make a more harmonious woman than girl, for she has not yet grown up to her
own character. But depend upon it, that girl never went to work of her own free choice."

"You say the father is out of work?" Robert said.

"Yes, he has not had work for six months. He said, with the most dejected dignity and appeal
that I ever saw in my life, that they begin to think him too old, that the younger men are
preferred."

"I wonder," Robert began, then he stopped confusedly. It had been on his tongue to say that
he wondered if he could not get some employment for him at Lloyd's; then he remembered his
uncle, and stopped. Robert had begun to understand the older man's methods, and also to understand
that they were not to be cavilled at or disputed, even by a nephew for whom he had undoubtedly
considerable affection.

"It is nonsense, of course," said Risley. "The man is not by any means old or past his usefulness,
although I must admit he has that look. He cannot be any older than your uncle. Speaking of
your uncle, how is Mrs. Lloyd?"

"I fear Aunt Lizzie is very far from well," replied Robert, "but she tries to keep it from
Uncle Norman."

"I don't see how she can. She looked ghastly when I met her the other day."

"That was when Uncle Norman was in New York," said Robert. "It is different when he is at home."
As he spoke, an expression of intensest pity came over the young man's face. "I wonder what
a woman who loves her husband will not do to shield him from any annoyance or suffering," he said.

"I believe some women are born fixed to a sort of spiritual rack for the sake of love, and
remain there through life," said Risley. "But I have always liked Mrs. Lloyd. She ought to
have good advice. What is it, has she told you?"

"Yes," said Robert.

"It will be quite safe with me."

Robert whispered one word in his ear.

"My God!" said Risley, "that? And do you mean to say that she has had no advice except Dr. Story?"

"Yes, I took her to New York to a specialist some time ago. Uncle Norman never knew it."

"And nothing can be done?"

"She could have an operation, but the success would be very doubtful."

"And that she will not consent to?"

"She has not yet."

"How long?"

"Oh, she may live for years, but she suffers horribly, and she will suffer more."

"And you say he does not know?"

"No."

"Why, look here, Robert, dare you assume the responsibility? What will he say when he finds
out that you have kept it from him?"

"I don't care," said Robert. "I will not break an oath exacted by a woman in such straits as
that, and I don't see what good it could do to tell him."

"He might persuade her to have the operation."

"His mere existence is persuasion enough, if she is to be persuaded. And I hope she may consent
before long. She has seemed a little more comfortable lately, too."

"I suppose sometimes those hideous things go away as mysteriously as they come," said Risley.

"Yes," replied Robert. "Going back to our first subject--"

Risley laughed. "Here she is coming," he said.

In fact, at that moment they came abreast the street that led to the factories, and the six-o'clock
whistle was just dying away in a long reverberation, and the workmen pouring out of the doors
and down the stairs. Ellen had moved quickly, for she had an errand at the grocery-store before
she went home. She was going to get some oysters for a hot stew for supper, of which her father
was very fond. She had a little oyster-can in her hand when she met the two gentlemen. She
had grown undeniably thinner since summer, but she was charming. Her short black skirt and
her coarse gray jacket fitted her as well as if they had been tailor-made. There was nothing
tawdry or slatternly about her. She looked every inch a lady, even with the drawback of an
oyster-can, and mittens instead of gloves.

Both Risley and Robert raised their hats, and Ellen bowed. She did not smile, but her face
contracted curiously, and her color obviously paled. Risley looked at Robert after they had passed.

"I have called on her twice," said Robert, as if answering a question. His relations with the
older man had become very close, almost like those of father and son, though Risley was hardly
old enough for that relation.

"And you haven't been since she went to work?"

"No."

"But you would have, had she gone to college instead of going to work in a shoe-factory?" 
Risley's voice had a tone of the gentlest conceivable sarcasm.

Robert colored. "Yes, I suppose so," he said. Then he turned to Risley with a burst of utter
frankness. "Hang it! old fellow," he said, "you know how I have been brought up; you know how
she--you know all about it. What is a fellow to do?"

"Do what he pleases. If it would please me to call on that splendid young thing, I should call
if I were the Czar of all the Russias."

"Well, I will call," said Robert.

Chapter XXXVIII

The very next evening Robert Lloyd went to call on Ellen. As he started out he was conscious
of a strange sensation of shock, as if his feet had suddenly touched firm ground. All these
months since Ellen had been working in the factory he had been vacillating. He was undoubtedly
in love with her; he did not for a moment cheat himself as to that. When he caught a glimpse
of her fair head among the other girls, he realized how unspeakably dear she was to him. Ellen
never entered nor left the factory that he did not know it. Without actually seeing her, he
was conscious of her presence always. He acknowledged to himself that there was no one like
her for him, and never would be. He tried to interest himself in other young women, but always
there was Ellen, like the constant refrain of a song. All other women meant to him not themselves,
but Ellen. Womanhood itself was Ellen for his manhood. He knew it, and yet that strain of utterly
impassionate judgment and worldly wisdom which was born in him kept him from making any advances
to her. Now, however, the radicalism of Risley had acted like a spur to his own inclination.
His judgment was in abeyance. He said to himself that he would give it up; he would go to see
the girl--that he would win her if he could. He said to himself that she had been wronged,
that Risley was right about her, that she was good and noble.

As the car drew near the Brewsters, his tenderness seemed to outspeed the electricity. The
girl's fair face was plain before his eyes, as if she were actually there, and it was idealized
and haloed as with the light of gold and precious stones. All at once, since he had given himself
loose rein, he overtook, as it were, the true meaning of her. "The dear child," he thought,
with a rush of tenderness like pain--"the dear child. There she gave up everything and went
to work, and let us blame her, rather than have her father blamed. The dear, proud child. She
did that rather than seem to beg for more help."

When Robert got off the car he was ready to fall at her feet, to push between her and the roughness
of life, between her and the whole world.

He went up the little walk between the dry shrubs and rang the bell. There was no light in
the front windows nor in the hall. Presently he heard footsteps, and saw a glimmer of light
advancing towards him through the length of the hall. There were muslin-curtained side-lights
to the door. Then the door opened, and little Amabel Tenny stood there holding a small kerosene
lamp carefully in both hands. She held it in such a manner that the light streamed up in Robert's
face and nearly blinded him. He was dimly conscious of a little face full of a certain chary
innocence and pathos regarding him.

"Is Miss Ellen Brewster at home?" asked Robert, smiling down at the little thing.

"Yes, sir," replied Amabel.

Then she remained perfectly still, holding the lamp, as if she had been some little sculptured
light-bearer. She did not return his smile, and she did not ask him in. She simply regarded
him with her sharp, innocent, illuminated face. Robert felt ridiculously nonplussed.

"Did you say she was in, my dear?" he asked.

"Yes, sir," replied Amabel, then relapsed into silence.

"Can I see her?" asked Robert, desperately.

"I don't know," replied Amabel. Then she stood still, as before, holding the lamp.

Robert began to wonder what he was to do, when he heard a woman's voice calling from the sitting-room
at the end of the hall, the door of which had been left ajar:

"Amabel Tenny, what are you doin'? You are coldin' the house all off! Who is it?"

"It's a man, Aunt Fanny," called Amabel.

"Who is the man?" asked the voice. Then, much to Robert's relief, Fanny herself appeared.

She colored a flaming red when she saw him. She looked at Amabel as if she had an impulse to
shake her.

"Why, Mr. Lloyd, is it you?" she cried.

"Good-evening, Mrs. Brewster; is--is your daughter at home?" asked Robert. He felt inclined
to roar with laughter, and yet a curious dismay was beginning to take possession of him.

"Yes, Ellen is at home," replied Fanny, with alacrity. "Walk in, Mr. Lloyd."  She was blushing
and smiling as if she had been her own daughter. It was foolish, yet pathetic. Although Fanny
asked the young man to walk in, and snatched the lamp peremptorily from Amabel's hand, she
still hesitated. Robert began to wonder if he should ever be admitted. He did not dream of
the true reason for the hesitation. There was no fire in the parlor, and in the sitting-room
were Andrew, John Sargent, and Mrs. Wetherhed. It seemed to her highly important that Ellen
should see her caller by herself, but how to take him into that cold parlor?

Finally, however, she made up her mind to do so. She opened the parlor door.

"Please walk in this way, Mr. Lloyd," said she, and Robert followed her in.

It was a bitter night outside, and the temperature in the unused room was freezing. The windows
behind the cheap curtains were thickly furred with frost.

"Please be seated," said Fanny.

She indicated the large easy-chair, and Robert seated himself without removing his outer coat,
yet the icy cold of the cushions struck through him.

Fanny ignited a match to light the best lamp with its painted globe. Her fingers trembled.
She had to use three matches before she was successful.

"Can't I assist you?" asked Robert.

"No, thank you," replied Fanny; "I guess the matches are damp. I've got it now."  Her voice
shook. She turned to Robert when the lamp was lighted, still holding the small one, which she
had set for the moment on the table. The strong double light revealed her face of abashed delight,
although the young man did not understand it. It was the solicitude of the mother for the child
which dignified all coarseness and folly.

"I guess you had better keep on your overcoat a little while till I get the fire built," said
she. "This room ain't very warm."

Robert tried to say something polite about not feeling cold, but the lie was too obvious. Instead,
he remarked that his coat was very warm, as it was, indeed, being lined with fur.

"I'll have the fire kindled in a minute," Fanny said.

"Now don't trouble yourself, Mrs. Brewster," said Robert. "I am quite warm in this coat, unless,"
he added, lamely, "I could go out where you were sitting."

"There's company out there," said Fanny, with embarrassed significance. She blushed as she
spoke, and Robert blushed also, without knowing why.

"It's no trouble at all to start a fire," said Fanny; "this chimney draws fine. I'll speak
to Ellen."

Robert, left alone in the freezing room, felt his dismay deepen. Barriers of tragedy are nothing
to those of comedy. He began to wonder if he were not, after all, doing a foolish thing. The
hall door had been left ajar, and he presently became aware of Amabel's little face and luminous
eyes set therein.

Robert smiled, and to his intense astonishment the child made a little run to him and snuggled
close to his side. He lifted her up on his knee, and wrapped his fur coat around her. Amabel
thrust out one tiny hand and began to stroke the sable collar.

"It's fur," said she, with a bright, wise look into Robert's face.

"Yes, it's fur," said he. "Do you know what kind?"

She shook her head, with bright eyes still on his.

"It is sable," said Robert, "and it is the coat of a little animal that lives very far north,
where it is as cold and colder than this all the time, and the ice and snow never melts."

Suddenly Amabel slipped off his knee, pushing aside his caressing arm with a violent motion.
Then she stood aloof, eying him with unmistakable reproof and hostility. Robert laughed.

"What is the matter?" he said.

"What does he do without his coat if it is as cold as that where he lives?" asked Amabel, severely.
There was almost an accent of horror in her childish voice.

"Why, my dear child," said Robert, "the little animal is dead. He isn't running around without
his coat. He was shot for his fur."

"To make you a coat?" Amabel's voice was full of judicial severity.

"Well, in one way," replied Robert, laughing. "It was shot to get the fur to make somebody
a coat, and I bought it. Come back here and have it wrapped round you; you'll freeze if you don't."

Amabel came back and sat on his knee, and let him wrap the fur-lined garment around her. A
strange sensation of tenderness and protection came over the young man as he felt the little,
slender body of the child nestle against his own. He had begun to surmise who she was. However,
Amabel herself told him in a moment.

"My mamma's sick, and they took her to an asylum. And my papa has gone away," she said.

"You poor little soul," said Robert, tenderly. Amabel continued to look at him with eyes of
keenest intelligence, while one little cheek was flattened against his breast.

"I live with Uncle Andrew and Aunt Fanny now," said she, "and I sleep with Ellen."

"But you like living here, don't you, you dear?" asked Robert.

"Yes," said Amabel, "and I like to stay with Ellen, but--but--I want to see my mamma and papa,"
she wailed, suddenly, in the lowest and most pitiful wail imaginable.

"Poor little darling," said Robert, stroking her flaxen hair. Amabel looked up at him with
her little face all distorted with grief.

"If you had been my papa, would you have gone away and left Amabel?" she asked, quiveringly.
Robert gathered her to him in a strong clasp of protection.

"No, you little darling, I never should," he cried, fervently.

At that moment he wished devoutly that he had the handling of the man who had deserted this child.

"I like you most as well as my own papa," said Amabel. "You ain't so big as my papa."  She
said that in a tone of evident disparagement.

Then the sitting-room door opened, and Fanny and Ellen and Andrew appeared, the last with a
great basket of wood and kindlings.

Robert set down Amabel, and sprang to his feet to greet Andrew and Ellen. Andrew, after depositing
his basket beside the stove, shook hands with a sort of sad awkwardness. Robert saw that the
man had aged immeasurably since he had last seen him.

"It is a cold night, Mr. Brewster," he said, and knew the moment he said it that it was not
a happy remark.

"It is pretty cold," agreed Andrew, "and it's cold here in this room."

"Oh, it'll be warm in a minute; this stove heats up quick," cried Fanny, with agitated briskness.
She began pulling the kindlings out of the basket.

"Here, you let me do that," said Andrew, and was down on his knees beside her. The two were
cramming the fuel into the little, air-tight stove, while Robert was greeting Ellen. The awkwardness
of the situation was evidently overcoming her. She was quite pale, and her voice trembled as
she returned his good-evening. Amabel left the young man, and clung tightly to Ellen's hand,
drawing her skirt around her until only her little face was visible above the folds.

The fumes from a match filled the room, and the fire began to roar.

"It'll be warm in a minute," said Fanny, rising. "You leave the register open till it's real
good and hot, Ellen, and there's plenty more wood in the basket. Here, Amabel, you come out
in the other room with Aunt Fanny."

But Amabel, instead of obeying, made a dart towards Robert, who caught her up, laughing, and
smuggled her into the depths of his fur-lined coat.

"Come right along, Amabel," said Fanny.

But Amabel clung fast to Robert, with a mischievous roll of an eye at her aunt.

"Amabel," said Fanny, authoritatively.

"Come, Amabel," said Andrew.

"Oh, let her stay," Robert said, laughing. "I'll keep her in my coat until it is warm."

"I'm afraid she'll bother you," said Fanny.

"Not a bit," replied Robert.

"You are a naughty girl, Amabel," said Fanny; but she went out of the room, with Andrew at
her heels. She did not know what else to do, since the young man had expressed a desire to
keep the child. She had thought he would have preferred a tête-à-tête with Ellen. Ellen sat
down on the sofa covered with olive-green plush, beyond the table, and the light of the hideous
lamp fell full upon her face. She was thin, and much of her lovely bloom was missing between
her agitation and the cold; but Robert, looking at her, realized how dear she was to him. There
was something about that small figure, and that fair head held with such firmness of pride,
and that soul outlooking from steady blue eyes, which filled all his need of life. His love
for the pearl quite ignored its setting of the common and the ridiculous. He looked at her
and smiled. Ellen smiled back tremulously, then she cast down her eyes. The fire was roaring,
but the room was freezing. The sitting-room door was opened a crack, and remained so for a
second, then it was widened, and Andrew peeped in. Then he entered, tiptoeing gingerly, as
if he were afraid of disturbing a meeting. He brought a blue knitted shawl, which he put over
Ellen's shoulders.

"Mother thinks you had better keep this on till the room gets warm," he whispered. Then he
withdrew, shutting the door softly.

Robert, left alone with Ellen in this solemnly important fashion, felt utterly at a loss. He
had never considered himself especially shy, but an embarrassment which was almost ridiculous
was over him. Ellen sat with her eyes cast down. He felt that the child on his knee was regarding
them both curiously.

"If you have come to see Ellen, why don't you speak to her?" demanded Amabel, suddenly. Then
both Robert and Ellen laughed.

"This is your aunt's little girl, isn't she?" asked Robert.

Amabel answered before Ellen was able. "My mamma is sick, and they carried her away to the
asylum," she told Robert. "She--she tried to hurt Amabel; she tried to"--Amabel made that hideous
gesture with her tiny forefinger across her throat. "Mamma was sick or she wouldn't," she added,
challengingly, to Robert.

"Of course she wouldn't, you poor little soul," said Robert.

Suddenly Amabel burst into tears, and began to wriggle herself free from his arms. "Let me
go," she demanded; "let me go. I want Ellen."

When Robert loosened his grasp she fled to Ellen, and was in her lap with a bound.

"I want my mamma--I want my mamma," she moaned.

Ellen leaned her cheek against the poor little flaxen head. "There, there, darling," she whispered,
"don't. Mamma will come home as soon as she gets better."

"How long will that be, Ellen?"

"Pretty soon, I hope, darling. Don't."

Poor Eva Tenny had been in the asylum some four months, and the reports as to her condition
were no more favorable. Ellen's voice, in spite of herself, had a hopeless tone, which the
child was quick to detect.

"I want my mamma," she repeated. "I want her, Ellen. It has been to-morrow, and to-morrow,
and to-morrow after that, and the to-morrows are yesterdays, and she hasn't come."

"She will come some time, darling."

Robert sat eying the two with intensest pity. "Do you like chocolates, Amabel?" he asked.

The child repeated that she wanted her mother still, as with a sort of mechanical regularity
of grief, but she fastened her eyes on him.

"Because I am going to send you a big box of them to-morrow," said Robert.

Amabel turned to Ellen. "Does he mean it?" she asked.

"I guess so," replied Ellen, laughing.

Amabel, looking from one to the other, also began to laugh unwillingly.

Then the sitting-room door opened, and Fanny called sharply and imperatively, "Amabel, Amabel;
come!"

Amabel clung more tightly to Ellen, who began to gently loosen her arms.

"Amabel Tenny, come this minute. It is your bed-time," said Fanny.

"I guess you had better go, darling," whispered Ellen.

"I don't want to go to bed till you do, Ellen," whispered the child.

Ellen gently but firmly unclasped the clinging arms. "Run along, dear," she whispered.

"I will send those chocolates to-morrow," suggested Robert.

Amabel seemed to do everything by sudden and violent impulses. All at once she ceased resisting.
She slid down from Ellen's lap as quickly as she had gotten into it. She clutched her neck
with two little wiry arms, kissed her hard on the mouth, darted across the room to Robert,
threw her arms around his neck and kissed him, then flew out of the room.

"She is an interesting child," said Robert, who felt, like most people, the delicate flattery
of a child's unsolicited caresses.

"I am very fond of her," replied Ellen.

Then the two were silent. Robert suddenly realized that there was little to say unless he ventured
on debatable ground. It would be too absurd of him to commence making love at once, and as
for asking Ellen about her work, that seemed a subject better let alone.

Ellen herself opened the conversation by inquiring for his aunt.

"Aunt Cynthia is very well," replied Robert. "I was in there last evening. You have not been
to see her lately, Miss Brewster."

Robert realized as soon as he had said that that he had made a mistake.

"No," replied Ellen. She obviously paled a little, and looked at him wistfully. The young man
could not stand it any longer, so straight into the heart of the matter he lunged.

"Look here, Miss Brewster," he said, "why on earth didn't you tell Aunt Cynthia?"

"Tell her?" repeated Ellen, vaguely.

"Yes; make a clean breast of it to her. Tell her just why you went to work, and gave up college?"

Ellen colored, and looked at him half defiantly, half piteously. "I told her all I ought to,"
she said.

"But you did not; pardon me," said Robert, "you did not tell her half enough. You let her think
that you actually of your own free choice went to work in the factory rather than go to college."

"So I did," replied Ellen, looking at him proudly.

"Of course you did, in one sense, but in another you did not. You deliberately chose to make
a sacrifice; but it was a sacrifice. You cannot deny that it was a sacrifice."

Ellen was silent.

"But you gave Aunt Cynthia the impression that it was not a sacrifice," said Robert, almost
severely.

Ellen's face quivered a little. "I saw no other way to do," she said, faintly. The authoritative
tone which this young man was taking with her stirred her as nothing had ever stirred her in
her life before. She felt like a child before him.

"You have no right to give such a false impression of your own character," said Robert.

"It was either that or a false impression of another," returned Ellen, tremulously.

"You mean that she might have blamed your parents, and thought that they were forcing you into
this?"

Ellen nodded.

"And I suppose you thought, too, that maybe Aunt Cynthia would suspect, if you told her all
the difficulties, that you were hinting for more assistance."

Ellen nodded, and her lip was quivering. Suddenly all her force of character seemed to have
deserted her, and she looked more like a child than Amabel. She actually put both her little
fists to her eyes. After all, the girl was very young, a child forced by the stress of circumstances
to premature development, but she could relapse before the insistence of another nature.

Robert looked at her, his own face working, then he could bear it no longer. He was over on
the sofa beside Ellen and had her in his arms. "You poor little thing," he whispered. "Don't.
I have loved you ever since the first time I saw you. I ought to have told you so before. Don't
you love me a little, Ellen?"

But Ellen released herself with a motion of firm elusiveness and looked at him. The tears still
stood in her eyes, but her face was steady. "I have been putting you out of my mind," said she.

"But could you?" whispered Robert, leaning over her.

Ellen did not reply, but looked down and trembled.

"Could you?" repeated Robert, and there was in his voice that masculine insistence which is
a true note of nature, and means the subjugation of the feminine into harmony.

Ellen did not speak, but every line in her body betrayed helpless yielding.

"You know you could not," said Robert with triumph, and took her in his arms again.

But he reckoned without the girl, who was, after all, stronger than her natural instincts,
and able to rise above and subjugate them. She freed herself from him resolutely, rose, and
stood before him, looking at him quite unfalteringly and accusingly.

"Why do you come now?" she asked. "You say you have loved me from the first. You came to see
me, you walked home with me, and said things to me that made me think--"  She stopped.

"Made you think what, dear?" asked Robert. He was pale and indescribably anxious and appealing.
It was suddenly revealed to him that this plum was so firmly attached to its bough of individuality
that possibly love itself could not loosen it.

"You made me think that perhaps you did care a little," said Ellen, in a low but unfaltering voice.

"You thought quite right, only not a little, but a great deal," said Robert, firmly.

"Then," said Ellen, "the moment I gave up going to college and went to work you never came
to see me again; you never even spoke to me in the shop; you went right past me without a look."

"Good God! child," Robert interposed, "don't you know why I did that?"

Ellen looked at him bewildered, then a burning red overspread her face. "Yes," she replied.
"I didn't. But I do now. They would have talked."

"I thought you would understand that," said Robert. "I had only the best motives for that.
I cannot speak to you in the factory any more than I have done. I cannot expose you to remark;
but as for my not calling, I believed what you said to my aunt and to me. I thought that you
had deliberately preferred a lower life to a higher one--that you preferred earning money to
something better. I thought--"

Robert fairly started as Ellen began talking with a fire which seemed to make her scintillate
before his eyes.

"You talk about a lower and a higher life," said she. "Is it true? Is Vassar College any higher
than a shoe-factory? Is any labor which is honest, and done with the best strength of man,
for the best motives, to support the lives of those he loves, or to supply the needs of his
race, any higher than another? Where would even books be without this very labor which you
despise--the books which I should have learned at college? Instead of being benefited by the
results of labor, I have become part of labor. Why is that lower?"

Robert stared at her.

"I have come to feel all this since I went to work," said Ellen, speaking in a high, rapid
voice. "When I went to work, it was, as you thought, for my folks, to help them, for my father
was out of work, and there was no other way. But since I have been at work I have realized
what work really is. There is a glory over it, as there is over anything which is done faithfully
on this earth for good motives, and I have seen the glory, and I am not ashamed of it; and
while it was a sacrifice at first, now, while I should like the other better, I do not think
it is. I am proud of my work."

The girl spoke with a sort of rapt enthusiasm. The young man stared, bewildered.

Robert caught Ellen's little hands, which hung, tightly clinched, in the folds of her dress,
and drew her down to his side again. "See here, dear," he said, "maybe you are right. I never
looked at it in this way before, but you do not understand. I love you; I want to marry you.
I want to make you my wife, and lift you out of this forever."

Then again Ellen freed herself, and straightened her head and faced him. "There is nothing
for me to be lifted out of," said she. "You speak as if I were in a pit. I am on a height."

"My God! child, how many others feel as you, do you think, out of the whole lot?" cried Robert.

"I don't know," replied Ellen, "but it is true. What I feel is true."

Robert caught up her little hand and kissed it. Then he looked at its delicate outlines. "Well,
it may be true," he said, "but look at yourself. Can't you see that you are not fashioned for
manual labor? Look at this little hand."

"That little hand can do the work," Ellen replied, proudly.

"But, dear," said Robert, "admitting all this, admitting that you are not in a position to
be lifted--admitting everything--let us come back to our original starting-point. Dear, I love
you, and I want you for my wife. Will you marry me?"

"No, I never can," replied Ellen, with a long, sobbing breath of renunciation.

"Why not? Don't you love me?"

"Yes. I think it must be true that I do. I said I wouldn't; I have tried not to, but I think
it must be true that I do."

"Then why not marry me?"

"Because it will be impossible for my father and mother to get along and support Amabel and
Aunt Eva without my help," said Ellen, directly.

"But I--" began Robert.

"Do you think I will burden you with the support of a whole family?" said Ellen.

"Ellen, you don't know what I would be willing to do if I could have you," cried the young
man, fervently. And he was quite in earnest. At that moment it seemed to him that he could
even come and live there in that house, with the hideous lamp, and the crushed-plush furniture,
and the eager mother; that he could go without anything and everything to support them if only
he could have this girl who was fairly storming his heart.

"I wouldn't be willing to have you," said Ellen, firmly. "As things are now I cannot marry
you, Mr. Lloyd. Then, too," she added, "you asked me just now how many people looked at all
this labor as I do, and I dare say not very many. I know not many of your kind of people. I
know how your uncle looks at it. It would hurt you socially to marry a girl from a shoe-shop.
Whether it is just or not, it would hurt you. It cannot be, as matters are now, Mr. Lloyd."

"But you love me?"

Ellen suddenly, as if pushed by some mighty force outside herself, leaned towards him, and
he caught her in his arms. He tipped back her face and kissed her, and looked down at her masterfully.

"We will wait a little," he said. "I will never give you up as long as I live if you love me,
Ellen."

Chapter XXXIX

When Ellen went out into the sitting-room that evening, after Robert Lloyd had taken leave,
her father and mother were still there, although the callers had gone. Both of them looked
furtively at her as she went through the room to the kitchen to get a lamp, then they looked
at each other. Fanny was glowing with half shamefaced triumph; Andrew was pale. Ellen did not
re-enter the room, but simply paused at the door, before going up-stairs, and they had a vision
of a face in a tumult of emotions, with eyes and hair illuminated to excess of brilliancy by
the lamp which she held.

"Good-night," she called, and her voice did not sound like her own.

"Something has happened," Fanny whispered to Andrew, when Ellen's chamber door had closed.

"Do you suppose she's goin' to?" whispered Andrew, in a sort of breathless fashion. His eyes
on his wife's face were sad and wistful.

"Hush! How do I know?" asked Fanny. "I always told you he liked her."

However, Fanny looked disturbed. Presently she went out in the kitchen to mix up some bread,
and she wept a little, standing in a corner, with her face hidden in the folds of an old shawl
which hung there on a peg. Dictatorial towards circumstances as she was when her beloved daughter
came in question, and proud as she was at the prospect of an advantageous marriage for her,
she remembered her sister in the asylum, she remembered how Andrew was out of work, and she
could not understand how it was to be managed. And all this was aside from the grief which
she would have felt in any case at losing Ellen.

As for Andrew, the next morning he put on his best clothes and went by trolley-cars to the
next manufacturing town, not a city like Rowe, but a busy little place with two large factories,
and tried in vain to get a job there. As he came home on the crowded car, his face was so despairing
that the people looked curiously at him. Andrew had always been mild and peaceable, but at
that moment anarchistic principles began to ferment in him. When a portly man, swelling ostentatiously
with broadcloth and fine linen, wearing a silk hat, and carrying a gold-headed cane like a
wand of office, got into the car, Andrew looked at him with a sidelong glance which was almost
murderous. The spiritual bomb, which is in all our souls for our fellow-men, began to swell
towards explosion. This man was the proprietor of one of the great factories in Leavitt, the
town where Andrew had vainly sought a job. He had been in the office when Andrew entered, and
the latter had heard his low voice of instruction to the foreman that the man was too old.
The manufacturer, who weighed heavily, and described a vast curve of opulence from silk hat
to his patent-leathers, sat opposite, his gold-headed cane planted in the aisle, his countenance
a blank of complacent power. Andrew felt that he hated him.

The man's face was not intellectual, not as intellectual as Andrew's. He gave the impression
of the force of matter oncoming and irresistible, some inertia which had started Heaven knew
how. This man had inherited great wealth, as Andrew knew. He had capital with which to begin,
and he had strength to roll the accumulating ball. Andrew felt more and more how he hated this
man. He had told his foreman that Andrew was too old, and Andrew knew that he was no older,
if as old, as the man himself.

"If I had been born under the Czar, and done with it, I should have felt differently," he told
himself. "But who is this man? What right has he to say that his fellow-men shall or shall
not? Does even his own property give him the right of dictation over others? What is property?
Is it anything but a temporary lease while he draws the breath of life? What of it in the tomb,
to which he shall surely come? Shall a temporary possession give a man the right to wield eternal
power? For the power of giving or withholding the means of life may produce eternal results."

When the man rose and moved down the car, oscillating heavily, steadying himself with his gold-headed
cane, and got out in front of a portentous mansion, Andrew would scarcely have recognized the
look in his own eyes had he seen himself in a mirror.

"That chap is pretty well fixed," said a man next him, to one on the other side.

"A cool half-million," replied the other.

"More than that," said the first speaker. "His father left him half a million to start with,
besides the business, and he's been piling up ever since."

"Do you work there?"

"Did, but I had what was mighty nigh a sunstroke last summer; had to quit. It was damned hot
up there under the roof. It's the same old factory his father had."

"Goin' to work again?"

"Next week, if I'm able, but I dun'no' whether I can stay there longer than till spring. It's
damned hot up there under the roof."

The man who spoke had a leaden hue of face, something ghastly, as if the deadly heat had begun
a work of decomposition. Andrew looked at him, and his hatred against the rich man who had
built himself a stately mansion, and kept his fellow-creatures at work for him in an unhealthy
factory in tropical heat, and had condemned him for being too old, was redoubled.

"Andrew Brewster, where have you been?" Fanny asked, when he got home.

"I've been to Leavitt," answered Andrew, shortly.

"To see if you could get a job there?"

"Yes."

Fanny did not ask if he had been successful. She sighed, and took another stitch in the wrapper
which she was making. That sigh almost drove Andrew mad.

"I don't see what has got you into such a habit of sighing," he said, brutally.

Fanny looked at him with reproachful anger. "Andrew Brewster, you ain't like yourself," said she.

"I can't help it."

"There's no need for you to pitch into me because you can't get work; I ain't to blame. I'm
doing all I can. I won't stand it, and you might as well know it first as last."

Fanny glared angrily at her husband, then the tears sprang to her eyes.

Andrew hesitated a moment, then he leaned over her and put his thin cheek against her rough
black hair. "The Lord knows I don't mean to be harsh to you, you poor girl," said he, "but
I wish I was dead."

Fanny seemed to spring into resistance like a wire. "Then you are a coward, Andrew Brewster,"
said she, hotly. "Talk about wishin' you was dead. I 'ain't got time to die. You'd 'nough sight
better go out into the yard and split up some of that wood."

"I didn't mean to speak so, Fanny," said Andrew, "but sometimes I get desperate, and I've been
thinking of Ellen."

"Don't you suppose I have?" asked Fanny, angrily.

"Well, there's one thing about it; we won't stand in her way," said Andrew.

"No, we won't," replied Fanny. "I'll go out washing first."

"She hasn't said anything?"

"No."

As time went on Ellen still said nothing. She had made a curious compact for a young girl with
her lover. She had stipulated that no engagement was to exist, that she should be perfectly
free--when she said that she thought of Maud Hemingway, but she said it without a tremor--and
if years hence both were free and of the same mind they might talk of it again.

Robert had rebelled strenuously. "You know this will shut me off from seeing much of you,"
he said. "You know I told you how it will be about my even talking much to you in the factory."

"Yes, I understand that now," replied Ellen, blushing; "and I understand, too, that you cannot
come to see me very often under such circumstances without making talk."

"How often?" Robert asked, impetuously.

Ellen hesitated, her lip quivered a little, but her voice was firm. "Not oftener than two or
three times a year, I am afraid," said she.

"Great Scott!" cried Robert. Then he caught her in his arms again. "Do you suppose I can stand
that?" he whispered. "Ellen, I cannot consent to this!"

"It is the only way," said she. She freed herself from him enough to look into his eyes with
a brave, fearless gaze of comradeship, which somehow seemed to make her dearer than anything else.

"But to see you to speak to only two or three times a year!" groaned Robert. "You are cruel,
Ellen. You don't know how I love you."

"There isn't any other way," said Ellen. Then she looked up into his face with a brave innocence
of confession like a child. "It hurts me, too," said she.

Robert had her in his arms, and was covering her face with kisses. "You darling," he whispered.
"It shall not be long. Something will happen. We cannot live so. We will let it go so a little
while, but something will turn up. I shall have a more responsible place and a larger salary,
then--"

"Do you think I will let you?" asked Ellen, with a great blush.

"I will, whether you will let me or not," cried Robert; and at that moment he felt inclined
to marry the entire Brewster family rather than give up this girl.

However, as he went home, walking that he might think the better, he had to confess to himself
that the girl was right; that, as matters were, anything definite was out of the question.
He had to admit that it might be a matter of years.

Chapter XL

When Ellen had been at work in the factory a year, she was running a machine and working by
the piece, and earning on an average eighteen dollars a week. Of course that was an unusual
advance for a girl, but Ellen was herself unusual. She came to work in those days with such
swiftness and unswerving accuracy that she seemed fairly a part of the great system of labor
itself. While she was at her machine, her very individuality seemed lost; she became an integral
part of a system.

"She's one of the best hands we ever had," Flynn told Norman Lloyd one day.

"I am glad to hear that," Lloyd responded, smiling with that peculiar smile of his which was
like a cold flash of steel.

"Curse him, he thinks no more of anybody in this shop than he does of the machine they work,"
Flynn thought as he watched the proprietor walking with his stately descent down the stairs.
The noon whistle was blowing, and the younger Lloyd went leaping down the stairs and joined
his uncle, then the two walked down the street, away from the factory. The factory at that
time of year began to present, in spite of its crude architecture, quite a charming appearance,
from the luxuriant vines which covered it and were beginning to get autumnal tints of red and
russet. All the front of Lloyd's was covered with vines, which had grown with amazing swiftness.
Mrs. Lloyd often used to look at them and reflect upon them with complacency.

"I should think it would make it pleasanter for the men to work in the factory, when it looks
so pretty and green," she told her husband one of the hottest days of the preceding summer.
As she spoke she compressed her lips in a way which was becoming habitual to her. It meant
the endurance of a sharp stab of vital pain. There was a terrible pathos in the poor woman's
appearance at that time. She still kept about. Her malady did not seem to be on the increase,
but it endured. Her form had changed indescribably. She had not lost flesh, but she had a curious,
distorted look, and one on seeing her had a bewildered feeling, and looked again to be sure
that he had seen aright. Her ghastly pallor she concealed in a manner which she thought distinctly
sinful. She painted and powdered. She did not dare purchase openly the concoctions which were
used for improving her complexion, but she went to a manicure and invested in a colored salve
for her finger-nails. This, with rather surprising skill for such a conscience-pricked tyro,
she applied to the pale curves of her cheeks and her blue lips. She took more pains than ever
before with her dress, and it was all to deceive her husband, that he should not be annoyed.
She felt a desperate shame because of her illness; she felt it to be a direct personal injury
to this masculine power which had been set over her gentle femininity. It was not so much because
she was afraid of losing his affection that she concealed her affliction from him, as because
she felt that the affliction itself was somehow an act of disloyalty. Her terrible malady had
in a way affected her reasoning powers, so that they had become distorted by a monstrous growth
of suffering, like her body. She would not give up going about as usual, and was never absent
from church. She drove about with her husband in his smart trap. Twice she had gone with Robert
to consult the New York specialist, taking times when Norman was away on business. She still
would not consent to an operation, and lately the specialist had been lukewarm in advising
it. He had indeed been doubtful from the first.

Mrs. Lloyd treated Robert with a soft affection which was almost like that of a mother. One
night, when he returned late from a call on Ellen, she sat up waiting for him. He had not called
on Ellen before for several months, and it was nearly midnight when he returned.

"Why, Aunt Lizzie, are you up?" he cried, as he entered the library door and saw his aunt's
figure, clad in shining black satin, gleaming with jet, in the depths of an easy-chair.

Mrs. Lloyd looked up at him with an expression of patient suffering. "I couldn't go to sleep
if I went to bed, Robert," she replied, in a hushed voice. She found it a comfort sometimes
to confess her pain to him. Robert went over to her, and drew her large, crinkled, blond head
to his shoulder as if she had been a child.

"Poor thing," he whispered, stroking her face pitifully. "Is it very terrible?" he asked, with
his lips close to her ear.

"Terrible," she whispered back. "Oh, Robert, you do not know; pray God you may never know."

"I wish to God I could bear it for you, Aunt Lizzie," Robert said, fervently.

"Oh, hush! If you or Norman had to bear anything like this, I should curse God and die," she
answered, and she shut her mouth hard, and her whole face was indicative of a repressed shriek.

"Aunt Lizzie, don't you think you ought to go to New York, that you ought--" Robert began,
but she stopped him with an almost fierce peremptoriness. "Robert Lloyd, I have trusted you,"
she said. "For God's sake, don't forsake me. Don't say a word to me about that; when I can
I will. It means my death, anyhow. Dr. Evarts thought so; you can't deny it."

"I think he thought there was a chance, Aunt Lizzie," Robert returned, but he said it faintly.

"You can't cheat me," replied Mrs. Lloyd. "I know."  She had a lapse from pain, and her features
began to assume their natural expression. She looked at him almost smiling, and as if she turned
her back upon her own misery. "Where have you been, Robert?" she asked.

Robert colored a little, but he answered directly enough. "I have been to make a call on Miss
Brewster," he said.

"You don't go there very often," said Mrs. Lloyd.

"No, not very often."

"She's a beautiful girl, as beautiful a girl as I ever laid eyes on, if she does work in the
shop," said Mrs. Lloyd, "and she's a good girl, too; I know she is. She was the sweetest little
thing when she was a child, and she 'ain't altered a mite!"  Then Mrs. Lloyd looked with a
sort of wistful curiosity at Robert.

"I think it is all true, what you say, Aunt Lizzie," replied Robert.

Mrs. Lloyd continued to look at him with that wistful scrutiny.

"Robert," she began, then she hesitated.

"What, Aunt Lizzie?"

"If--ever you wanted to marry that girl, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't, for my part."

Robert pulled a chair close to his aunt, and sat down beside her, still holding her hand.

"I've a good mind to tell you the whole story, Aunt Lizzie," he said.

"I wish you would, Robert. You know I think as much of you as if you were my own son, and I
won't tell anybody, not even your uncle, if you don't want me to."

"Well, then, it is all in a nutshell," said Robert. "I like her, you know, and I think I have
ever since I saw her in her little white gown at the high-school exhibition."

"Wasn't she sweet?" said his aunt.

"And she likes me, too, I think."

"Of course she does."

"But you know what my salary is, and her whole family is in a measure dependent upon her."

"Hasn't her father got work?"

"No."

"I'll speak to Norman," cried Mrs. Lloyd, quickly. "I know he would do it for me."

"But even then, Aunt Lizzie, there is the aunt in the asylum, and the child, and--"

"Your uncle will pay you more."

"It isn't altogether that; in fact, it isn't that at all which is at the bottom of the difficulty.
The difficulty is with Ellen herself. She will never consent to my marrying her, and having
to support her family, while matters are as now. You don't know how proud she is, Aunt Lizzie."

"She is a splendid girl."

"As far as I am concerned I would marry the whole lot on a little more than I have now, but
she would not let me do it. There's nothing to do but to wait."

"Perhaps the aunt will get well and her husband will come back; and I will see, anyway, if
Norman won't give her father work," said Mrs. Lloyd.

"I think you had better not, Aunt Lizzie."

"Why not, Robert?"

"There are reasons why I think you had better not."  Robert would not tell her that Ellen had
begged him not to use any influence of his to get her father work.

"After the way father has been turned off, I can't stand it," she had said, with a sort of
angry dignity which was unusual to her. In fact, her father himself had begged her not to make
use of Robert in any way for his own advancement.

"If they don't want me for my work, I don't want to crawl in because the nephew of the boss
likes my daughter," he had said. This speech was fairly rough for him, but Ellen had understood.

"I know what you mean, father," she said.

"I'd rather work in the road," said Andrew. That autumn he was getting jobs of clearing up
yards of fallen leaves, and gathering feed-corn and pumpkins, and earning a pittance. Fanny
continued to work on her wrappers. "It's a mercy wrappers don't go out of fashion," she often said.

"I suppose things that folks can get for nothing ain't so apt to go out of fashion," Andrew
retorted, bitterly. He hated the wrappers with a deadly hatred. He hated the sight of the limp
row of them on his bedroom wall. Nobody knew how the family pinched and screwed in those days.

They were using the small fund which they secured from the house mortgage, Ellen's earnings,
and Fanny's and Andrew's, and every cent had to be counted, but there was something splendid
in their loyalty to poor Eva in the asylum. The thought of deserting her in her extremity never
occurred to them.

Mrs. Lloyd spoke of her that night, when she and Robert were talking together in the library.

"They are good folks, to keep on doing for that poor woman in the asylum," she said.

"They would never desert a dog that belonged to them," Robert answered, fervently. "I tell
you that trait is worth a good many others, Aunt Lizzie."

"I guess it is," said his aunt. Then another paroxysm of pain seized her. She looked at Robert
with a convulsed, speechless face. He held her hands more tightly, his own face contracting
in sympathy, and watched his aunt with a sort of angry helplessness. But he felt as if he wanted
to fight something for the sake of this poor, oppressed, innocent creature; indeed, he felt
fairly blasphemous. But this time the pain passed quickly, and Mrs. Lloyd looked at her nephew
with an expression of relief and gentleness which was almost angelic. When the pain was over
she thought again of the Brewsters, and how they would not have forsaken her in her misery,
had she belonged to them, any more than they had forsaken the insane aunt.

"They are good folks," said she, "and that is the main thing. That is the main thing to consider
when you are marrying into a family, Robert. It is more than riches and position. The power
they've got of loving and standing by each other is worth more than anything else."

"You are right, Aunt Lizzie, I guess there's no doubt of that," said Robert.

"And that girl's beautiful," said Mrs. Lloyd. She gazed at the young man with a delicate understanding
and sympathy which was almost beyond that of a sweetheart. Robert felt as if a soft hand of
tenderness and blessing were laid on his inmost heart. He looked at her like a grateful child.

"There isn't anybody like her, is there, Aunt Lizzie?" he asked.

"No, I don't think there is, dear boy," said Mrs. Lloyd. "I do think she is the sweetest little
thing I ever saw in my life."

Robert brought his aunt's hand to his lips and kissed it. It seemed to him for a minute as
if the love and sympathy of this martyr were almost more precious than the love of Ellen herself.

He realized when he was in his own room, and the house was quiet, how much he loved his aunt,
and how hard her pain and probably inevitable doom were for him to bear. Then something came
to him which he had never felt before--a great, burning anxiety and tenderness and terror over
Ellen, because she was of the weaker half of creation, which is born to the larger share of
pain in the world. He felt that he would almost have given her up, yielded up forever all his
delight in her, to spare her; for the pain of knighthood, which is in every true lover, awoke
in his heart.

Chapter XLI

Nahum Beals was a laster in Lloyd's. Late in the autumn, when Ellen had been in the factory
a little over a year, there began to be a subtle condition of discontent and insubordination.
Men gathered in muttering groups, of which Nahum Beals seemed always to be the nucleus. His
high, rampant voice, restrained by no fear of consequences, always served as the key-note to
the chorus of rebellion. Ellen paid little attention to it. She was earning good wages, and
personally she had nothing of which to complain. She had come to regard Beals as something
of a chronic fanatic, but as she knew that the lasters were fairly paid, she had not supposed
it meant anything. However, one night, going home from the factory, her eyes were opened. Abby
and Maria Atkins and Mamie Brady were with her, and shortly after they had left the shop Abby
stopped Granville Joy, Frank Dixon, and Willy Jones, who with another young man were swinging
past without noticing the girls, strange to say. Abby caught Joy by the arm.

"Hold on a minute, Granville Joy," said she. "I want to know what's up with the lasters."

Granville laughed, with an uneasy, sidelong, deprecating glance at Ellen. "Oh, nothing much,"
said he.

Willy Jones stood still, coloring, gazing at Abby with a half-terrified expression. Dixon walked
on, and the other young man, Amos Lee, who was dark and slight and sinewy, stared from one
to the other with quick flashes of black eyes. He looked almost as if he had gypsy blood in
him, and he came of a family which was further on the outskirts of society than the Louds had been.

When Granville replied "nothing much" to Abby's question, Amos Lee frowned with a swift contraction
of dissent, but did not speak until Abby had retorted. "You needn't talk that way to me, Granville
Joy," said she. "You can't cheat me. I know something's up."

"It ain't nothin', Abby," said Granville, but it was quite evident that he was lying.

Then Lee spoke up, in a sudden fury of enthusiasm. "There is somethin' up," said he, "and I
don't care if you do know it. There's--" he stopped as Granville clutched his arm violently
and whispered something.

"Well, maybe you're right," said Lee to Joy. "Look here," he continued to Abby, "you and Ellen
come along here a little ways, and I'll tell you."

After Maria and Mamie had passed on, Joy and Jones and Lee, standing close to the two girls,
began to talk, Lee leading.

"Well, look here," he said, in a hushed voice. "We've found out--no matter how, but we've found
out--that the boss is goin' to dock the lasters' pay."

"How much?" asked Abby.

"Fifteen per cent."

"Good Lord!" said Abby.

"We ain't going to stand it," said Lee.

"I don't see how we can stand it," said Willy Jones, with a slightly interrogative tone directed
towards Abby. Granville looked at Ellen.

"Are you sure?" she asked.

"Perfectly sure," replied Granville. "What do you think about it, Ellen?"

"What are you going to do?" asked Ellen, thoughtfully.

"Strike for fifteen per cent. more before he has a chance to dock us," cried Lee, with a hushed
vehemence, looking about warily to make sure that no one overheard.

"The worst of it is, I know it all comes from Nahum Beals, and he's half cracked," said Abby,
bluntly.

"He's got the right of it, anyhow," said Lee.

The two girls walked on, while the men lingered behind to talk.

"Do you suppose it is true, Abby?" asked Ellen.

"I don't know. I should, if it wasn't for that Lee fellow. I can't bear him. And that Nahum
Beals, I believe he's half mad."

"I feel the same way about him," said Ellen; "but think what it would mean, fifteen per cent.
less on their wages."

"It doesn't mean so much for those young fellows, except Willy Jones; he's got enough on his
shoulders."

"No, but ever so many of the lasters have large families."

"I hope they don't drag Willy Jones into it," said Abby. She looked back as she spoke. Willy,
in the little knot of men, was looking after her, and their eyes met. Abby colored.

"It's a shame to dock his wages," she said.

"Whose--Willy Jones's?"

"Yes. I hope he won't get into any trouble. I can't bear that Lee."

"Still, to dock their wages fifteen per cent.," said Ellen, thoughtfully.

"What right has Mr. Lloyd?"

"I suppose he'd say he has the right because he has the capital."

"I don't see why that gives him the right."

"You'd better go and talk to him," said Abby. "As for me, I made up my mind when I went to
work in the shop that I'd got to be a bond-slave, all but my soul. That can kick free, thank
the Lord."

"I didn't make up my mind to it," said Ellen. "I am not going to be a slave in any way, and
I am not going to approve of others being slaves."

"You think they ought to strike?"

"Yes, if it is true that Mr. Lloyd is going to dock their wages, but I don't feel sure that
it is true. Mr. Beals is a queer man. Sometimes I have thought he was dangerous."

Chapter XLII

Tuesday evening was one of those marvellously clear atmospheres of autumn which seem to be
clearer from the contrast to the mists of the recent summer. The stars swarmed out in unnumbered
hosts.

"Seems to me I never saw so many stars," one would say to another. The air had the sharp cleave
of the frost in it. Everything was glittering with a white rime--the house roofs, and the levels
of fields on the outskirts of the little city.

Ellen had an errand down-town that evening, and she wrapped herself up warmly, putting on a
fur collar which she had not worn since the winter before. She felt strangely nervous and disturbed
as she set out.

"Don't you want your father to go with you?" asked Fanny, for in some occult fashion the girl's
perturbation seemed to be communicated to her. She followed her to the door.

"Seems kind of lonesome for you to go alone," she said, anxiously.

"As if I minded! Why, it is as bright as day with the electric-lights, and there are houses
almost all the way," laughed Ellen.

"Your father could go with you, or he could go for you."

"No, he couldn't go for me. I want to get one of the new catalogues at the library and pick
out a book, and there is no sense in dragging father out. He has a cold, too. Why, there is
nothing in the world to be afraid of, mother."

"Well, don't be any longer than you can help," said Fanny.

Ellen, as she passed her grandmother's house, saw a curtain drawn with a quick motion. That
happened nearly every time she passed. She knew that the old woman was always on the lookout
for her, and always bent on concealing it. Mrs. Zelotes never went into her son's house, and
never spoke to Ellen in those days. She had aged rapidly during the past year, and even her
erect carriage had failed her. She stooped rigidly when she walked. She was fairly racked with
love and hatred of Ellen. She adored her, she could have kissed the ground she walked on, and
yet she was so full of wrath against her for thwarting her hopes for her own advancement that
she was conscious of cruel impulses in her direction.

Ellen walked along rapidly under the vast canopy of stars, about which she presently began
to have a singular impression. She felt as if they were being augmented, swelled as if by constantly
oncoming legions of light from the space beyond space, and as if her little space of individuality,
her tiny foothold of creation, was being constantly narrowed by them.

"I never saw so many stars," she said to herself. She looked with wonder at the Milky Way,
which was like a zone of diamond dust. Suddenly a mighty conviction of God, which was like
the blazing forth of a new star, was in her soul. Ellen was not in a sense religious, and had
never united with the Congregational Church, which she had always attended with her parents;
she had never been responsive to efforts made towards her so-called conversion, but all at
once, under the stars that night, she told herself with an absolute certainty of the truth
of it. "There is something beyond everything, beyond the stars, and beyond all poor men, and
beyond me, which is enough for all needs. We shall have our portion in the end."

She had been feeling discouraged lately, although she would not own it even to herself. She
saw Robert but seldom, and her aunt was no better. She often wondered if there could be anything
before her but that one track of drudgery for daily bread upon which she had set out. She wondered
if she ought not to say positively to Robert that there must be no thought of anything between
them in the future. She wondered if she were not wronging him. Once or twice she had seen him
riding with Miss Hemingway, and thought that, after all, that was a girl better suited to him,
and perhaps if he had no hope whatever of her he might turn to the other to his own advantage.
But to-night, with the clear stimulus of the frost in her lungs, and her eyes and soul dazzled
with the multiplicity of stars, she began to have a great impetus of courage, like a soldier
on the morning of battle. She felt as if she could fight for her joy and the joy of others,
and victory would in the end be certain; that the chances of victory ran to infinity, and could
not be measured.

However, all the while, in spite of her stimulation of spirits, there was that vague sense
of excitement, as over some impending crisis. That she could not throw off. Suddenly she found
herself searching the road ahead of her, and often turning at the fancied sound of a footstep.
She began to wish that her father had come with her; then she told herself how foolish she
was, for he had a cold, and this keen air would have been sure to give him more. The electric-car
passed her, and she had a grateful sense of companionship. She looked after its diminishing
light in the distance, and almost wished that she had stopped it, but car-fares had to be counted
carefully.

She began to dread unspeakably passing the factories. She told herself that there was no sense
in it, that it was not late, that the electric-light made it like high noon, that there was
a watchman in each building, that there was nothing whatever to fear; but it was in vain. It
was only by a great effort of her will that she did not turn and go back home when she reached
Lloyd's.

Lloyd's came first; then, a few rods farther, on the other side of the street, McGuire's, and
then Briggs's.

Ellen had a library book under her arm, and she clutched her dress-skirt firmly. A terror as
to the supernatural was stealing over her. She felt as she had when waking in the night from
some dreadful dream, though all the time she was dinning in her ears how foolish she was. She
saw the lantern of the night-watchman in Lloyd's moving down a stair which crossed a window.

She came opposite Lloyd's, and, just as she did so, saw a dark figure descending the right-hand
flight of stairs from the entrance platform. She thought, from something in the carriage, that
it was Mr. Lloyd, and hung back a little, reflecting that she would keep behind him all the
way to town.

The man reached the ground at the foot of the stairs, then there was a flash of fire from the
shadow underneath, and a shot rang out. Ellen did what she could never have counted upon herself
for doing. She ran straight towards the man, who had fallen prostrate like a log, and was down
on the ground beside him, with his head on her lap, shouting for the night-watchman, whose
name was McLaughlin.

"McLaughlin!" she shouted. But there was no need of it, for he had heard the shot. The cry
had not left Ellen's lips before she was surrounded by men, one of whom was Granville Joy,
one was Dixon, and one was John Sargent.

Joy and Sargent had met down-town, and were walking home together, when the shot rang out,
and they had rushed forward. Then there was McLaughlin, the watchman of Lloyd's, and the two
watchmen from Briggs's and McGuire's came pelting down their stairs, swinging their lanterns.

They all stood around the wounded man and Ellen, and stared for a second. They were half stupefied.

"My God! this is a bad job," said Dixon.

"Go for a doctor," cried Ellen, hoarsely.

"We're a pack of fools," ejaculated Sargent, suddenly. Then he gave Granville Joy a push on
the back. "Run for your life for the first doctor," he cried, and was down on his knees beside
the wounded man. Lloyd seemed to be quite insensible. There was a dark spot which was constantly
widening in a hideous circle of death on his shirt-front when Sargent opened his coat and vest
tenderly.

"Is he--" whispered Ellen. She held one of Lloyd's hands in a firm clutch as if she would in
such wise hold him to life.

"No, not yet," whispered Sargent. Dixon knelt down on the other side, and took Lloyd's other
hand and felt his pulse. McLaughlin was rushing aimlessly up and down, talking as he went.

"I never heard a thing till that shot came," he kept repeating. "He'd jest been in to get his
pocketbook he'd left in the office. I never heard a thing till I heard that shot."

Sargent was opening Lloyd's shirt. "McLaughlin, for God's sake stop talking and run for another
doctor, in case Joy does not get one at once," he cried; "then go to his house, and tell young
Lloyd, but don't say anything to his wife."

"Poor Mrs. Lloyd," whispered Ellen.

The sick man sighed audibly. It seemed as if he had heard. The other watchmen stood looking
on helplessly.

"Why in thunder don't you two scatter, and see if you can't catch him," cried Dixon to them.
"He can't be far off."

But the words had no sooner left his mouth than up came a great Swede who was one of the workmen
in Lloyd's, and he had Nahum Beals in a grasp as imperturbable as fate. The assassin, even
with the strength of his fury of fanaticism, was as a reed in the grasp of this Northern giant.
The Swede held him easily, walking him before him in a forced march. He had a hand of Nahum's
in each of his, and he compelled Nahum's right hand to retain the hold of the discharged pistol.
There was something terrible about the Swede as he drew near, a captor as unyielding and pitiless
as justice itself. He was even smiling with a smile which showed his gums from ear to ear,
but there was no joy in his smile, and no triumph. His blue eyes surveyed them all with the
placid content of achievement.

"I have him," he said. "I heard him shoot, and I heard him run, and I stood still until he
ran into my arms. I have him."

Nahum, in the grasp of this fate, was quivering from head to foot, but not from fear.

"Is he dead?" he shouted, eagerly.

"Hush up, you murderer," cried Dixon. "We didn't want any such work as this, damn you. Keep
fast hold of him, Olfsen."

"I will keep him fast," replied the Swede, smiling.

Then there was a swift clatter of wheels, and two doctors drove up, and men came running. The
space in front of Lloyd's was black with men. Robert Lloyd was among them. Granville Joy had
met him on the street.

"You'd better go down to the factory, quick," he had said, hoarsely. "There's trouble there;
your uncle--"

Robert pushed through the crowd, which made way respectfully for him. He knelt down beside
the wounded man. "Is he--" he whispered to Sargent.

"Not yet," whispered Sargent, "but I'm afraid it's pretty bad."

"You here?" Robert said to Ellen.

"Yes," she answered, "I was passing when I heard the shot."

"See here," said Robert, "I don't know but I am asking a good deal, but will you get into Dr.
James's buggy, and let his man drive you to my aunt's, and you break it to her? She likes you.
I must stay with him. I don't want her to know it first when he is brought home."

"Yes, that will be the best way," said the other physician, who was the one regularly employed
by the Lloyds. "Some one must tell her first, and if she knows this young lady--"

"I will go," said Ellen.

Dr. Story whispered something to Ellen as she was getting into the buggy. Then Dr. James's
man drove her away down the street.

There was a little black mare harnessed to the buggy, and she went with nervous leaps of speed.
When Ellen reached the Lloyd house she saw that it was blazing with light. Norman Lloyd was
fond of brilliant light, and would have every room in his house illuminated from garret to cellar.

As Ellen went up the stone steps she saw a woman's figure in the room at the right, which moved
to an attitude of attention when she rang the bell.

Before Ellen could inquire for Mrs. Lloyd of the maid who answered her ring there was a shrill
cry from the room on the right.

"Who is it? Who is it?" demanded the voice.

Then, before Ellen could speak, Mrs. Lloyd came running out.

"What is it?" she said. "Tell me quick. I know something has happened. Tell me quick. You came
in Dr. James's buggy, and the man was driving fast. Tell me."

"Oh, Mrs. Lloyd," said Ellen. Then she could say no more, but the other woman knew.

"Is he dead?" she asked, hoarsely.

"Oh, no, no, not dead."

"Hurt?"

Ellen nodded, trembling.

"How?"

"He was shot."

"Who shot him?"

"One of the workmen. They have him. Carl Olfsen found him."

"One of the workmen, when he has always been so good!"

Suddenly Mrs. Lloyd seemed to gather herself together into the strength of action.

"Are they bringing him home?" she asked Ellen, in a sharp, decisive voice.

"I think they must be by this time."

"Then I've got to get ready for him. Come, quick."

There was by that time a man and two women servants standing near them, aghast. Mrs. Lloyd
turned to the man.

"Go down to the drug-store and get some brandy, there isn't any in the house," said she; "then
come back as quick as you can. Maggie, you see that there is plenty of hot water. Martha, you
and Ellen come up-stairs with me, quick."

Ellen followed Mrs. Lloyd and the maid up-stairs, and, before she knew what she was doing,
was assisting to put the room in perfect readiness for the wounded man. The maid was weeping
all the time she worked, although she had never liked Mr. Lloyd. There was something about
her mistress which was fairly abnormal. She kept looking at her. This gentle, soft-natured
woman had risen above her own pain and grief to a sublime strength of misery.

"Get the camphor, quick, Martha," she said to the maid, who flew out, with the tears streaming.
Ellen stood on one side of the bed, and Mrs. Lloyd on the other. Mrs. Lloyd had stripped off
the blankets, and was pinning the sheet tightly over the mattress. She seemed to know instinctively
what to do.

"I wish you would bring that basin over here, and put it on the stand," said Mrs. Lloyd. "Martha,
you fetch more towels, and, Maggie, you run up garret and bring down some of those old sheets
from the trunk under the window, quick."

This maid, who was as large and as ample as her mistress, fled out of the room with heavy,
noiseless pads of flat feet.

All the time Mrs. Lloyd worked she was evidently listening. She paid no attention to Ellen
except to direct her. All at once she gave a great leap and stood still.

"They're coming," said she, though Ellen had heard nothing. Ellen went close to her, and took
her two fat, cold hands. She could say nothing. Then she heard the roll of carriage-wheels
in the street below.

Mrs. Lloyd pulled her hands away from Ellen's and went to the head of the stairs.

"Bring him right up here," she ordered, in a loud voice.

Ellen stood back, and the struggling procession with the prostrate man in the midst labored
up the broad stairs.

"Bring him in here," said Mrs. Lloyd, "and lay him on the bed."

When Lloyd was stretched on the bed, the crowd drew back a little, and she bent over him.

Then she turned with a sort of fierceness to the doctors.

"Why don't you do something?" she demanded. She raised a hand with a repellant gesture towards
the other men.

"You had better go now," said she. "I thank you very much. If there is anything you can do,
I will let you know."

When Mrs. Lloyd was left with the two doctors and a young assistant, Robert, and Ellen, she
said, cutting her words short as if she released every one from a mental grip:

"I have got everything ready. Shall I go out now?"

"I think you had better, Mrs. Lloyd," said the family physician, pityingly. He went close to Ellen.

"Can't you stay with her a little while?" he whispered.

Ellen nodded.

Then the physician spoke quite loudly and cheerfully to Mrs. Lloyd.

"We are going to probe for the ball," he said. "We must all hope for the best, Mrs. Lloyd."

Mrs. Lloyd made no reply. She bent again over her husband with a rigid face, and kissed him
on his white lips, then she went out, with Ellen following.

Norman Lloyd lived only two hours after he was shot. The efforts to remove the ball had to
be abandoned. He was conscious only a few minutes. He suddenly began to look about him with
comprehension.

"Robert," he said, in a far-away voice.

Robert stooped closely over his uncle. The dying man looked up at him with an expression which
he had never worn in life.

"That man was insane," whispered he, faintly. Then he added, "Look out for her, if she has
to go through the operation. Take care of her. Make it as easy for her as you can."

"Then you know, Uncle Norman," gasped Robert.

"All the time, but it--pleased her to think I--did not. Don't let her know I knew. Take care--"

Then Norman Lloyd relapsed into unconsciousness, and the whole room and the whole house became
clamorous with his stertorous breathing. Mrs. Lloyd and Ellen came and stood in the doorway.
The doctor whispered to them. Then the breathing ceased, although at first it was inconceivable
that the silence did not continue to ring with it, and Mrs. Lloyd came into the room.

Chapter XLIII

When Mrs. Lloyd entered the room, the attention of every one was taken from the dead man on
the bed and concentrated upon the woman. Dr. Story, a nervous, intense, elderly man with a
settled frown of perplexity over keen eyes, which he had gotten from a struggle of forty years
with unanswerable problems of life and death, stepped towards her hastily. Robert pressed close
to her side. Ellen came behind her, holding in a curious, instinctive fashion to a fold of
the older woman's gown, as if she had been a mother holding back a child from a sudden topple
to its hurt. Everybody expected her to make some heart-breaking manifestation. She did nothing.
At that moment the sublime unselfishness of the woman, which was her one strength of character,
seemed actually to spread itself, as with wings, before them all. She moved steadily, close
to her husband on the bed. She gazed at that profile of rigid calmness and enforced peace,
which, although the head lay low, seemed to have an effect of upward motion, as if it were
cleaving the mystery of space. Mrs. Lloyd laid her hand upon her husband's forehead; she felt
a slight incredulousness of death, because it was still warm. She took his hands, drew them
softly together, and folded them upon his breast. Then she turned and faced them all with an
angelic expression.

"He did not realize it to suffer much?" she said.

"No, Mrs. Lloyd," replied Dr. Story, quickly. "No, I assure you that he suffered very little."

"He seemed very happy when he died, Aunt Lizzie," said Robert, huskily.

Mrs. Lloyd looked away from them all around the room. It was a magnificent apartment. Norman
Lloyd had had an artistic taste as well as wealth. The furnishings had always been rather beyond
Mrs. Lloyd's appreciation, but she admired them kindly. She took in every detail; the foam
of rich curtains at the great windows, the cut-glass and silver on the dressing-table, the
pale softness of a polar-bear skin beside the bed, the lifelike insistence of the costly pictures
on the walls.

"He's gone where it is a great deal more beautiful," she said to them, like a child. "He's
gone where there's better treasures than these which he had here."

They all looked at her in amazement. It actually seemed as if, for the moment, the woman's
sole grief was over the loss to her husband of those things which he had on earth--the treasures
of his mortal state.

Robert took hold of his aunt's arm and led her, quite unresisting, from the room, and as she
went she felt for Ellen's hand. "It is time she was home," she said to Robert. "Her folks will
be worried about her. She's been a real comfort to me."

It was the first time that Ellen had ever seen death, that she had ever seen the living confronted
with it. She felt as if a wave were breaking over her own head as she clung fast to Mrs. Lloyd's
hand.

"Sha'n't I stay?" she whispered, pitifully, to her. "If I can send word to my mother--"

"No, you dear child," replied Mrs. Lloyd, "you've done enough, and you will have to be up early
in the morning."  Then she checked herself. "I forgot," said she to Robert; "the factory will
be closed till after the funeral, won't it?"

"Of course it will, Aunt Lizzie."

"And the workmen will be paid just the same, of course," said Mrs. Lloyd. "Now, can't you take
her home, Robert?"

"Oh, don't mind about me," cried Ellen.

"You can have a horse put into the buggy," said Mrs. Lloyd.

"Oh, you mustn't leave her now," Ellen whispered to Robert. "Let somebody else take me--Dr.
James--"

"I would rather you took her," said Mrs. Lloyd. "And you needn't worry about his leaving me,
dear child; the doctor will stay until he comes back."

As Robert was finally going out his aunt caught his arm and looked at him with a radiant expression.
"He will never know about me now," said she, "and it won't be long before I-- Oh, I feel as
if I had gotten rid of my own death."

She was filled with inexpressible thankfulness that she had herself to bear what she had dreaded
for her husband. "Only think how hard it would have been for Norman," she said to Cynthia,
the next day.

Cynthia looked at her wonderingly. She could have understood this feeling over a dearly beloved
child. "You are a good woman, Lizzie," she said, in a tone of pitiful respect.

"Not half as good a woman as he was a man," returned Mrs. Lloyd, jealously. "Norman wasn't
a professor, I know, but he was a believer. You don't think it is necessary to be a professor
in order to be saved, do you, Cynthia?"

"I certainly do not," Cynthia replied. "I wish you would go and lie down, Lizzie."

"Oh, I can't. I wouldn't let anybody do these things but me, for the whole world."  Mrs. Lloyd
was arranging flowers, tuberoses and white carnations, in vases, and the whole house was scented
with them. She looked ghastly, yet still unconquerably happy. She had now no reason to conceal
the ravages of disease, and her color was something frightful. Still, she did not suffer as
much, for her mind had overborne her body to such an extent that she had the mastery for the
time, to a certain extent, of those excruciating stabs of pain. People looked at her incredulously.
They could not believe that she felt as she talked, that she was as happy and resigned as she
looked, but it was all true. It was either an abnormal state into which her husband's death
had thrown her, or one too normal to be credited. She looked at it all with a supreme childishness
and simplicity. She simply believed that her husband was in heaven, where she should join him;
that he was beyond all suffering which might have come to him through her, and all that troubled
her was the one consideration of his having been forced to leave his treasures of earth. She
looked at various things which had been prized by the dead man, and found her chief comfort
in saying to the minister or Cynthia or Robert that Norman had loved these, but he would have
that which was infinitely more precious. She even gazed out of the window, that Tuesday night,
and saw her nephew driving away with Ellen, and reflected, with pain, that her husband had
been fond and proud of that bay. She was a little at a loss to conceive what could make up
to her husband for that in another world, but she succeeded, and evolved from her own loving
fancy, and her recollection of the Old Testament, a conception of some wonderful creature,
shod with thunder and maned with a whirlwind. Her disease, and a drug she had been taking of
late, stimulated her imagination to results of grotesque pathos, but she was comforted.

That night when they were alone, Robert turned to the girl at his side with a sudden motion.
It was no time for love-making, for that was in the mind of neither of them, but the bereavement
of this other woman, and the tragedy of her state, filled him with a sort of protective pain
towards the girl who might some time have to suffer through him the same loss.

"Are you all tired out, dear?" he said, and passed his free arm around her waist.

"No," replied Ellen. Then, since she was only a girl, and overwrought, having been through
a severe strain, she broke down, and began to cry.

Robert drew her closer, and she hid her face on his shoulder. "Poor little girl, it has been
very hard for you," he whispered.

"Oh, don't think of me," sobbed Ellen. "But I can't bear it, the way she acts and looks. It
is sadder than grief."

"She is not going to live long herself, dear," said Robert, in a stifled voice.

"And he--did not know?"

"Hush! yes; but you must never tell any one. She tried to keep it from him. That is her comfort."

"Oh," said Ellen. She looked up at the white face of the young man bending over her, and suddenly
the realization of a love that was mightier than all the creatures who came of it and all who
followed it was over her.

Chapter XLIV

When Ellen did not return, there was some alarm in the Brewster household. Mrs. Zelotes came
over, finally, in a quiver of anxiety.

"Maybe I had better start out and see if I can find her," said Andrew.

"I think you had better," returned his mother. "She went before eight o'clock, and it's most
midnight, and I've set at my window watchin' ever since. I don't see what you've been thinkin'
about, waitin' all this time. I guess if I was a man I shouldn't have waited."

"I think she may have gone in to see Abby Atkins--it's on the way--and not realized how late
it was," said Fanny, obstinately, but with a very white face. She drew her thread through with
a jerk. It knotted, and she broke it off viciously.

"Fiddlesticks!" said her mother-in-law.

"There's no use imaginin' things," said Fanny, angrily; "but I think myself you'd better go
now, Andrew, and see if you can see anything of her."

"I'm goin' with him," announced Mrs. Zelotes.

"Now, mother, you'd better stay where you be," said Andrew, putting on his hat. Then the door
flew open, and Amos Lee, who had seen the light in the windows, and was burning to impart the
news of the tragedy, rushed in.

"Heard what's happened?" he cried out.

They all thought of Ellen. "What?" demanded Andrew, in a terrible voice. Fanny dropped her
work and stared at him, with her chin falling as if she were dying. Mrs. Zelotes made a queer
gurgling noise in her throat. Lee stared at them a second, bewildered by the effect of his
own words, although they had for him such a tragic import. Andrew caught hold of him in a grasp
like the clamp of a machine. "What?" he demanded again.

"The boss has been shot," cried Lee, getting his breath.

Andrew dropped his arm, and they all stared at him. Lee went on fluently, as if he were a fakir
at a fair.

"Nahum Beals did it. The boss went back to the office to get his pocketbook; McLaughlin saw
him; then he went down the stairs; Nahum, he--he fired; he had been hidin' underneath the stairs.
Carl Olfsen caught him, and he's in jail. Your daughter she was there when the shot came, and
run up and held his head. The young boss he sent her in Dr. James's buggy to Mrs. Lloyd to
break the news. She 'ain't got home?"

"No," gasped Andrew.

"The boss has been shot; he's dead by this time," repeated Lee. "Beals did it; they've got
him."  There was the most singular evenness and impartiality in his tone, although he was evidently
strained to a high pitch of excitement. It was impossible to tell whether he exulted in or
was aghast at the tragedy.

"Oh, that poor woman!" cried Fanny.

"I'd like to know what they'll do next," cried Mrs. Zelotes. "I should call it pretty work."

"Nahum Beals has acted to me as if he was half crazy for some time," said Fanny.

"No doubt about it," said Lee; "but I shouldn't wonder if he had to swing."

"It's dreadful," said Fanny. "I wonder when she's comin' home."

"Seems as if they might have got somebody besides that girl to have gone there," said Mrs. Zelotes.

"She happened to be right on the spot," said Lee, importantly.

Andrew seemed speechless; he leaned against the mantel-shelf, gazing from one to the other,
breathing hard. He had had bitter feelings against the murdered man, and a curious sense of
guilt was over him. He felt almost as if he were the murderer.

"Andrew, I dun'no' but you'd better go up there and see if she's comin' home," said Fanny;
and he answered heavily that maybe he had better, when they heard wheels, which stopped before
the house.

"They're bringin' her home," said Lee.

Andrew ran and threw open the front door. He had a glimpse of Robert's pale face, nodding to
him from the buggy as he drove away, and Ellen came hastening up the walk.

"Well, Ellen, this is pretty dreadful news," said her father, tremulously.

"So you have heard?"

"Amos Lee has just come in. It's a terrible thing, Ellen."

"Yes, it's terrible," returned Ellen, in a quick, strained voice. She entered the sitting-room,
and when she met her mother's anxious, tender eyes, she stood back against the wall, with her
hands to her face, sobbing. Fanny ran to her, but her grandmother was quicker. She had her
arms around the girl before the mother had a chance.

"If they couldn't get somebody besides you," she said, in a voice of intensest love and anger,
"I should call it pretty work. Now you go straight to bed, Ellen Brewster, and I'm goin' to
make a bowl of sage tea, and bring it up, and see if it won't quiet your nerves. I call it
pretty work."

"Yes, you'd better go to bed, Ellen," said Andrew, gulping as if he were swallowing a sob.

Mrs. Zelotes fairly forced Ellen towards the door, Fanny following.

"Don't talk and wake Amabel," whispered Ellen, forcing back her sobs.

"Was he dead when you got there, Ellen?" called out Lee.

Mrs. Zelotes turned back and looked at him. "It's after midnight, and time for you to be goin'
home," she said. Then the three disappeared. Lee grinned sheepishly at Andrew.

"Your mother is a stepper of an old woman," said he.

"It's awful news," said Andrew, soberly. "Whatever anybody may have felt, nobody expected--"

"Of course they didn't," retorted Lee, quickly. "Nahum went a step too far."  He started for
the door as he spoke.

"Well, he was crazy, without any doubt!" said Andrew.

"He'll have to swing for it all the same," said Lee, going out.

"It don't seem right, if he wasn't himself when he did it."

"Lord, we're all crazy when it comes to things like that," returned Lee. Before closing the
door he flashed his black eyes and white teeth at Andrew, who felt repelled.

He sat down beside the table and leaned his head upon it. To his fancy all creation seemed
to circle about that one dead man. Mr. Lloyd had been for years the arbiter of his destiny,
almost of his life. Andrew had regarded him with almost feudal loyalty and admiration, and
lately with bitter revolt and hatred, and now he was dead. He felt no sorrow, but rather a
terrible remorse because he felt no sorrow. All the bitter thoughts which he had ever had against
Lloyd seemed to marshal themselves before him like an accusing legion of ghosts. And with it
all there was a sense of desolation, as if some force which had been necessary to his full
living had gone out of creation.

"It's over thirty years since I went to work under him," Andrew thought, and he gave a dry
sob. At that moment a wonderful pity and sorrow for the dead man seemed to spring up in his
soul like a light. He felt as if he loved him.

Norman Lloyd's funeral was held in the First Baptist Church of Rowe. It was crowded. Mr. Lloyd
had been the most prominent manufacturer and the wealthiest man in the city. His employés filled
up a great space in the body of the church.

Andrew went with his mother and wife. They arrived quite early. When Andrew saw the employés
of Lloyd's marching in, he drew a great sigh. He looked at the solemn black thing raised on
trestles before the pulpit with an emotion which he could not himself understand. "That man
'ain't treated me well enough for me to care anything about him," he kept urging upon himself.
"He never paid any more attention to me than a gravel-stone under his feet; there ain't any
reason why I should have cared about him, and I don't; it can't be that I do."  Yet arguing
with himself in this way, he continued to eye the casket which held his dead employer with
an unyielding grief.

Mrs. Zelotes sat like a black, draped statue at the head of the pew, but her eyes behind her
black veil were sharply observant. She missed not one detail. She saw everything; she counted
the wreaths and bouquets on the casket, and stored in her mind, as vividly as she might have
done some old mourning-piece, the picture of the near relatives advancing up the aisle.

Mrs. Lloyd came leaning on her nephew's arm, and there were Cynthia Lennox and a distant cousin,
an elderly widow who had been summoned to the house of death.

Ellen sat in the body of the church, with the employés of Lloyd's, between Abby Atkins and
Maria. She glanced up when the little company of mourners entered, then cast her eyes down
again and compressed her lips. Maria began to weep softly, pressing her handkerchief to her
eyes. Ellen's mother had begged her not to sit with the employés, but with her and her father
and grandmother in their own pew, but the girl had refused.

"I must sit where I belong," said she.

"Maybe she thinks it would look as if she was putting on airs on account of--" Fanny said to
Andrew when Ellen had gone out.

"I guess she's right," returned Andrew.

The employés had contributed money for a great floral piece composed of laurel and white roses,
in the shape of a pillow. Mamie Brady, who sat behind Ellen, leaned over, and in a whisper
whistled into her ear.

"Ain't it handsome?" said she. "Can you see them flowers from the hands?"

Ellen nodded impatiently. The great green and white decoration was in plain view from her seat,
and as she looked at it she wondered if it were a sarcasm or poetic truth beyond the scope
of the givers, the pillow of laurel and roses, emblematic of eternal peace, presented by the
hard hands of labor to dead capital.

Of course the tragic circumstances of Norman Lloyd's death increased the curiosity of the public.
Gradually the church became crowded by a slow and solemn pressure. The aisles were filled.
The air was heavy with the funeral flowers. The minister spoke at length, descanting upon the
character of the deceased, his uprightness and strict integrity in business, avoiding pitfalls
of admissions of weaknesses with the expertness of a juggler. He was always regarded as very
apt at funerals, never saying too much and never too little. The church was very still, the
whole audience wrapped in a solemn hush, until the minister began to pray; then there was a
general bending of heads and devout screening of faces with hands. Then all at once a sob from
a woman sounded from the rear of the church. It was hysterical, and had burst from the restraint
of the weeper. People turned about furtively.

"Who was that?" whispered Mamie Brady, after a prolonged stare over her shoulders from under
her red frizzle of hair. "It ain't any of the mourners."

Ellen shook her head.

"Do keep still, Mamie Brady," whispered Abby Atkins.

The sob came again, and this time it was echoed from the pew where sat the members of the dead
man's family. Mrs. Lloyd began weeping convulsively. Her state of mind had raised her above
natural emotion, and yet her nerves weakly yielded to it when given such an impetus. She wept
like a child, and now and then a low murmur of heart-broken complaint came from her lips, and
was heard distinctly over the church. Other women began to weep. The minister prayed, and his
words of comfort seemed like the air in a discordant medley of sorrow.

Andrew Brewster's face twitched; he held his hands clutched tightly. Fanny was weeping, but
the old woman at the head of the pew sat immovable.

When the services were over, and the great concourse of people had passed around the casket
and viewed the face of the dead, with keen, sidewise observation of the funeral flowers, Mrs.
Zelotes pressed out as fast as she was able without seeming to crowd, and caught up with Mrs.
Pointdexter, who had sat in the rear of the church.

She came alongside as they left the church, and the two old women moved slowly down the sidewalk,
with lingering glances at the funeral procession drawn up in front of the church.

"Who was that cryin' so in back; did you see?" asked Mrs. Zelotes of Mrs. Pointdexter, whose
eyes were red, and whose face bore an expression of meek endurance of a renewal of her own
experience of sorrow.

"It was Joe Martin's wife," said she. "I sat just behind her."

"What made her?"

Then both started, for the woman who had sobbed came up behind them, her brother, an elderly
man, trying to hold her back.

"You stop, John," she cried. "I heard what she said, and I'm goin' to tell her. I'm goin' to
tell everybody. Nobody shall stop me. There the minister spoke and spoke and spoke, and he
never said a word as to any good he'd done. I'm goin' to tell. I wanted to stan' right up in
the church an' tell everybody. He told me not to say a word about it, an' I never did whilst
he was livin', but now I'm goin' to stan' up for the dead."  The woman pulled herself loose
from her brother, who stood behind her, frightened, and continually thrusting out a black-gloved
hand of remonstrance. People began to gather. The woman, who was quite old, had a face graven
with hard lines of habitual restraint, which was now, from its utter abandon, at once pathetic
and terrible. She made a motion as if she were thrusting her own self into the background.

"I'm goin' to speak," she said, in a high voice. "I held my tongue for the livin', but I'm
goin' to speak for the dead. My poor husband died twenty years ago, got his hand cut in a machine
in Lloyd's, and had lockjaw, and I was left with my daughter that had spinal disease, and my
little boy that died, and my own health none too good, and--and he--he--came to my house, one
night after the funeral, and--and told me he was goin' to look out for me, and he has, he has.
That blessed man gave me five dollars every week of my life, and he buried poor Annie when
she died, and my little boy, and he made me promise never to say a word about it. Five dollars
every week of my life--five dollars."

The woman's voice ended in a long-drawn, hysterical wail. The other women who had been listening
began to weep. Mrs. Pointdexter, when she and Mrs. Zelotes moved on, was sobbing softly, but
Mrs. Zelotes's face, though moved, wore an expression of stern conjecture.

"I'd like to know how many things like that Norman Lloyd did," said she. "I never supposed
he was that kind of a man."

She had a bewildered feeling, as if she had to reconstruct her own idea of the dead man as
a monument to his memory, and reconstruction was never an easy task for the old woman.

Chapter XLV

A Short time after Norman Lloyd's death, Ellen, when she had reached the factory one morning,
met a stream of returning workmen. They swung along, and on their faces were expressions of
mingled solemnity and exultation, as of children let out to play because of sorrow in the house,
which will not brook the jarring inconsequence of youth.

Mamie Brady, walking beside a young man as red-haired as herself, called out, with ill-repressed
glee, "Turn round, Ellen Brewster; there ain't no shop to-day."

The young man at her side, nervously meagre, looked at Ellen with a humorous contortion of
this thin face, then he caught Mamie Brady by the arm, and swung her into a hopity-skip down
the sidewalk. Just behind them came Granville Joy, with another man. Ellen stopped. "What is
it?" she said to him. "Why is the shop closed?"

Granville stopped, and let the stream of workmen pass him and Ellen. They stood in the midst
of it, separating it, as rock will separate a current. "Mrs. Lloyd is dead," Granville replied,
soberly.

"I heard she was very low last night," Ellen returned, in a hushed voice.

Then she passed Granville, who stood a second gazing wistfully after her, before he resumed
his homeward way. He told himself quite accurately that she had purposely refrained from turning,
in order to avoid walking with himself. A certain resentment seized him. It seemed to him that
something besides his love had been slighted. "She needn't have thought I was going to make
love to her going home in broad daylight with all these folks," he reflected, and he threw
up his head impatiently.

The man with whom he had been walking when Ellen appeared lingered for him to rejoin him. "Wonder
how many shops they'd shut up for you and me," said the man, with a sort of humorous bitterness.
He had a broad face, seemingly fixed in an eternal mask of laughter, and yet there were hard
lines in it, and a forehead of relentless judgment overhung his wide bow of mouth and his squat
and wrinkled nose.

"Guess not many," replied Granville, echoing the man in a way unusual to him.

"And yet if it wa'n't for us they couldn't keep the shop running at all," said the man, whose
name was Tom Peel.

"That's so," said Granville, with a slight glance over his shoulder.

Ellen had met the Atkins girls, and had turned, and was coming back with them. It was as he
had thought.

"If the new boss cuts down fifteen per cent., as the talk is, what be you goin' to do?" asked
Tom Peel.

"I ain't goin' to stand it," replied Granville, fiercely.

"Ain't goin' to be swept clean by the new broom, hey?" said the man, with a widened grin.

"No!" thundered Granville--"not by him, nor any one like him. Damn him!"

Tom Peel's grin widened still further into an intense but silent laugh.

Meantime Ellen was walking with Abby and Maria.

"I wonder how we're going to get along with young Lloyd," said Abby.

Ellen looked at her keenly. "Why?" she said.

"Oh, I heard the men talking the other night after I'd gone to bed. Maybe it isn't true that
he's thinking of cutting down the wages."

"It can't be," said Ellen.

"I say so, too," said Maria.

"Well, I hope not," said Abby. "You can't tell. Some chimneys always have the wind whistling
in them, and I suppose it's about so with a boot and shoe shop. It don't follow that there's
going to be a hurricane."

They had come to the entrance of the street where the Atkins sisters lived, and Ellen parted
from them.

She kept on her way quite alone. They had walked slowly, and the other operatives had either
boarded cars or had gone out of sight.

Ellen, when she turned, faced the northwest, out of which a stiff wind was blowing. She thrust
a hand up each jacket-sleeve, folding her arms, but she let the fierce wind smite her full
in the face without blenching. She had a sort of delight in facing a wind like that, and her
quick young blood kept her from being chilled. The sidewalk was frozen. There was no snow,
and the day before there had been a thaw. One could see on this walk, hardened into temporary
stability, the footprints of hundreds of the sons and daughters of labor. Read rightly, that
sidewalk in the little manufacturing city was a hieroglyphic of toil, and perhaps of toil as
tending to the advance of the whole world. Ellen did not think of that, for she was occupied
with more personal considerations, thinking of the dead woman in the great Lloyd house. She
pictured her lying dead on that same bed whereon she had seen her husband lie dead. All the
ghastly concomitants of death came to her mind. "They will turn off all that summer heat, and
leave her alone in this freezing cold," she thought. She remembered the sound of that other
woman's kind voice in her ears, and she saw her face when she told her the dreadful news of
her husband's death. She felt a sob rising in her throat, but forced it back. What Abby had
told concerning Mrs. Lloyd's happiness in the face of death seemed to her heart-breaking, though
she knew not why. That enormous, almost transcendent trust in that which was absolutely unknown
seemed to engulf her.

When she reached home, her mother looked at her in astonishment. She was sewing on the interminable
wrappers. Andrew was paring apples for pies. "What be you home for--be you sick?" asked Fanny.
Andrew gazed at her in alarm.

"No, I am not sick," replied Ellen, shortly. "Mrs. Lloyd is dead, and the factory's closed."

"I heard she was very low--Mrs. Jones told me so yesterday," said Fanny, in a hushed voice.
Andrew began paring another apple. He was quite pale.

"When is the funeral to be, did you hear?" asked Fanny. Ellen was hanging up her hat and coat
in the entry.

"Day after to-morrow."

"Have you heard anything about the hands sending flowers?"

"No."

"I suppose they will," said Fanny, "as long as they sent one to him. Well, she was a good woman,
and it's a mark of respect, and I 'ain't anything to say against it, but I can't help feeling
as if it was a tax."

Chapter XLVI

It was some time after Mrs. Lloyd's death. Ellen had not seen Robert except as she had caught
from time to time a passing glimpse of him in the factory. One night she overheard her father
and mother talking about him after she had gone to bed, the sitting-room door having been left
ajar.

"I thought he'd come and call after his aunt died," she heard Fanny say. "I've always thought
he liked Ellen, an' here he is now, with all that big factory, an' plenty of money."

"Mebbe he will," replied Andrew, with a voice in which were conflicting emotions, pride and
sadness, and a struggle for self-renunciation.

"It would be a splendid thing for her," said Fanny.

"It would be a splendid thing for him," returned Andrew, with a flash.

"Land, of course it would! You needn't be so smart, Andrew Brewster. I guess I know what Ellen
is, as well as you. Any man might be proud to get her--I don't care who--whether he's Robert
Lloyd, or who, but that don't alter what I say. It would be a splendid chance for Ellen. Only
think of that great Lloyd house, and it must be full of beautiful things--table linen, and
silver, and what-not. I say it would be a splendid thing for her, and she'd be above want all
her life--that's something to be considered when we 'ain't got any more than we have to leave
her, and she workin' the way she is."

"Yes, that's so," assented Andrew, with a heavy sigh, as of one who looks upon life from under
the mortification of an incubus of fate.

"We'd ought to think of her best good," said Fanny, judiciously. "I've been thinkin' every
evening lately that he'd be comin'. I've had the fire in the parlor stove all ready to touch
off, an' I've kept dusted in there. I know he liked her, but mebbe he's like all the rest of
the big-bugs."

"What do you mean?" asked Andrew, with an inward qualm of repulsion. He always hated unspeakably
to hear his wife say "big-bugs" in that tone. Although he was far from being without humility,
he was republican to the core in his estimate of his own status in his own free country. In
his heart, as long as he kept the law of God and man, he recognized no "big-bugs."  It was
one of the taints of his wife's ancestry which grated upon him from time to time.

"Oh, well, mebbe he don't want to be seen callin' on a shop-girl."

"Then he'd better keep away, that's all!" cried Andrew, furiously.

"Oh, well, mebbe it ain't so," said Fanny. "He's always seemed to me like a sensible feller,
and I know he's liked Ellen, an' lots of girls that work in shops marry rich. Look at Annie
Graves, married that factory boss over to Pemberton, an' has everythin'. She'd worked in his
factory years. Mebbe it ain't that."

"Ellen don't act as if she minded anything about his not comin'," said Andrew, anxiously.

"Land, no; she ain't that kind. She's too much like her grandmother, but there 'ain't been
a night lately that she 'ain't done her hair over when she got home from the shop and changed
her dress."

"She always changes her dress, don't she?" said Andrew.

"Oh yes, she always has done that. I guess she likes to get rid of the leather smell for a
while; but she has put on that pretty, new, red silk waist, and I've seen her watchin', though
she's never said anything."

"You don't suppose she--" began Andrew, in a voice of intensest anxiety and indignant tenderness.

"Land, no; Ellen Brewster ain't a girl to fret herself much over any man unless she's sure
he wants her; trust her. Don't you worry about that. All I mean is, I know she's had a kind
of an idea that he might come."

Ellen, up-stairs, lay listening against her will, and felt herself burning with mortified pride
and shame. She said to herself that she would never put on that red silk waist again of an
evening; she would not even do her hair over. It was quite true that she had thought that Robert
might come, that he might renew his offer, now that he was so differently situated, and the
obstacles, on his side, at least, removed. She told herself all the time that the obstacles
on her own were still far from removed. She asked herself how could she, even if this man loved
her and wished to marry her, allow him to support all her family, although he might be able
to do so. She often told herself that she ought perhaps to have pride enough to refuse, and
yet she watched for him to come. She had reflected at first that it was, of course, impossible
for him to seem to take advantage of the deaths which had left him with this independence,
that he must stay away for a while from motives of delicacy; but now the months were going,
and she began to wonder if he never would come. Every night, when she took off the pretty,
red silk waist, donned in vain, and let down her fair lengths of hair, it was with a sinking
of her heart, and a sense of incredulous unhappiness. Ellen had always had a sort of sanguinity
of happiness and of the petting of Providence as well as of her friends. However, the girl
had, in spite of her childlike trust in the beauty of her life, plenty of strength to meet
its refutal, and a pride equal to her grandmother's. In case Robert Lloyd should never approach
her again, she would try to keep one face of her soul always veiled to her inmost consciousness.

The next evening she was careful not to put on her red silk waist, but changed her shop dress
for her old blue woollen, and only smoothed her hair. She even went to bed early in order to
prove to her mother that she expected nobody.

"You ain't goin' to bed as early as this, Ellen?" her mother said, as she lighted her lamp.

"Yes, I'm going to bed and read."

"Seems as if somebody might be in," said Fanny, awkwardly.

"I don't know who," Ellen returned, with a gentle haughtiness.

Andrew colored. He was at his usual task of paring apples. Andrew, in lieu of regular work
outside, assisted in these household tasks, that his wife might have more time to sew. He looked
unusually worn and old that night.

"If anybody does come, Ellen will have to get up, that's all," said Fanny, when the girl had
gone up-stairs. Then she pricked up her ears, for the electric-car had stopped before the house.
Then it went on, with a sharp clang of the bell and a gathering rush of motion.

"That car stopped," Fanny said, breathlessly, her work falling from her fingers. Andrew and
she both listened intently, then footsteps were heard plainly coming around the path at the
side of the house.

Fanny's face fell. "It's only some of the men," said she, in a low voice. Then there came a
knock on the side door, and Andrew ushered in John Sargent, Joe Atkins, and Amos Lee. Nahum
Beals did not come in those days, for he was in prison awaiting trial for the murder of Norman
Lloyd. However, Amos Lee's note was as impressive as his. He called often with Sargent and
Atkins. They could not shake him off. He lay in wait for them at street corners, and joined
them. He never saw Ellen alone, and did not openly proclaim his calls as meant for her. She
prevented him from doing that in a manner which he could not withstand, full of hot and reckless
daring as he was. When he entered that night he looked around with keen furtiveness, and was
evidently listening and watching for her, though presently his voice rose high in discussion
with the others. After a while the man who lived next door dropped in, and his wife with him.
She and Fanny withdrew to the dining-room with their sewing--for the woman also worked on wrappers--and
left the sitting-room to the men.

"It beats all how they like to talk," said the woman, with a large-minded leniency, "and they
never get anywhere," she added. "They work themselves all up, and never get anywhere; but men
are all like that."

"Yes, they be," assented Fanny.

"Jest hear that Lee feller," said the woman.

Amos Lee's voice was audible over the little house, and could have been heard in the yard,
for it had an enormous carrying quality. It was the voice of a public ranter. Ellen, up in
her chamber, lying in her bed, with a lamp at her side, reading, closely covered from the cold--for
the room was unheated--heard him with a shiver of disgust and repulsion, and yet with a fierce
sympathy and loyalty. She could not distinguish every word he said, but she knew well what
he was talking about.

Mrs. Lloyd's death had made a certain hush in the ferment of revolt at Lloyd's, but now it
was again on the move. There was a strong feeling of dislike to young Lloyd among the workmen.
His uncle had heaped up ill-feeling as well as wealth as a heritage for him. The older Lloyd
had never been popular, and Robert had succeeded to all his unpopularity, and was fast gathering
his own. He was undoubtedly disposed to follow largely his uncle's business methods. He had
admired them, they had proved successful, and he had honestly seen nothing culpable in them
as business methods go; so it was not strange that he tried to copy them when he came into
charge of Lloyd's. He was inclined to meet opposition with the same cool inflexibility of persistency
in his own views, and was disposed to consult his own interests and carry out his own plans
with no more brooking of interference than the skipper of a man-o'-war. Therefore, when it
happened, shortly after his aunt's death, that he conceived a dissatisfaction with some prominent
spirits among union men, he discharged them without the slightest reference to the fact that
they were old and skilful workmen, and employed non-union men from another town in their places.
He had, indeed, the object of making in time his factory entirely non-union. He said to himself
that he would be dictated to by no labor organization under the sun, and that went a step beyond
his uncle, inasmuch as the elder Lloyd had always made his own opinion subservient to good
business policy; but Robert was younger and his blood hotter. It happened, also, a month later,
when he began to see that business had fallen off considerably (indeed, it was the beginning
of a period of extreme business depression), and that he could no longer continue on the same
scale with the same profits, that instead of assembling the men in different departments, communicating
the situation to them, and submitting them a reduced price-list for consideration, as was the
custom with the more pacific of the manufacturers in the vicinity, he posted it up in the different
rooms with no ado whatever. That had been his uncle's method, but never in the face of such
brewing discontent as was prevalent in Lloyd's at that time. It was an occasion when the older
man would have shut down, but Robert had, along with his arbitrary impetuosity, a real dislike
to shut down on account of the men, for which they would have been the last to give him credit.
"Poor devils," he told himself, standing in the office window one night, and seeing them pour
out and disappear into the early darkness beyond the radius of the electric-lights, "I can't
turn them adrift without a dollar in midwinter. I'll try to run the factory a while longer
on a reduced scale, if I only meet expenses."

He saw Ellen going out, descending the steps with the Atkins girls, and as she passed the light,
her fair head shone out for a second like an aureole. A great wave of tenderness came over
him. He reflected that it would make no difference to her, that it was only a question of time
before he lifted her forever out of the ranks of toil. The impulse was strong upon him to go
to see her that night, but he had set himself to wait three months after his aunt's death,
and the time was not yet up. He had a feeling that he might seem to be, and possibly would
be, taking advantage of his bereavement if he went sooner, and that Ellen herself might think so.

It was that very night that Ellen had gone to bed early, to prove not only to her mother but
to herself that she did not expect him, and the men came to see Andrew. Once she heard Amos
Lee's voice raised to a higher pitch than ever, and distinguished every word.

"I tell you he's goin' to cut the wages to-morrow," said he.

There was a low rumble of response, which Ellen could not understand, but Lee's answer made
it evident.

"How do I know?" he thundered. "It is in the air. He don't tell any more than his uncle did;
but you wait and see, that's all."

"I don't believe it," the girl up-stairs said to herself, indignantly and loyally. "He can't
cut the wages of all those poor men, he with all his uncle's money."

But the next morning the reduced price-list was posted on the walls of the different rooms
in Lloyd's.

Chapter XLVII

There was a driving snow-storm the next day. When Ellen started for the factory the white twilight
of early morning still lingered. Everywhere were the sons and daughters of toil plodding laboriously
and noiselessly through the snow, each keeping in the track of the one who went before. There
was no wind blowing, and the snow was in a blue-white level; the trees bent stiffly and quietly
beneath a heavy shag of white, and now and then came a clamor of birds, which served to accentuate
the silence and peace. Ellen could always be forced by an extreme phase of nature to forgetfulness
of her own stresses. For the time being she forgot everything; her vain watching for Robert,
the talk of trouble in the factory, the disappointment in her home--all were forgotten in the
contemplation, or rather in the absorbing, of this new-old wonder of snow.

There was a survival of the old Greek spirit in the girl, and had she come to earth without
her background of orthodox traditions, she might have easily found her own deities in nature.
The peace of the snow enveloped her soul as well as the earth, and she became a beneficiary
of the white storm; the graceful droop of the pine boughs extended to her thoughts, and the
clamor of the birds aroused in her a winged freedom, so that she felt at once peace and a sort
of ecstasy. She walked in the track of a stolidly plodding man before her, as different a person
as if she were an inhabitant of another planet. He was digesting the soggy, sweet griddle-cakes
which he had eaten for breakfast, and revolving in his mind two errands for his wife--one,
a pail of lard; the other, three yards of black dress braid; he was considering the surface
scum of existence, that which pertained solely to his own petty share of it; the girl, the
clear residue of life which was, and had been, and would be. Each was on the way to humble
labor for daily bread, but with a difference of eternity between them.

But when Ellen reached the end of the cross street where the Atkins girls lived, she heard
a sound which dispelled her rapt state. Her far vision became a near one; she saw, as it were,
the clouded window-glass between her mortal eyes and the beyond, and the sound of a cough brought
it about. Abby and Maria were coming towards her through the snow. Maria was coughing violently,
and Abby was scolding her.

"I don't care anything about it, Maria Atkins," Abby was saying, "you ought to be ashamed of
yourself coming out such a morning as this. There isn't any sense in it. You know you'll catch
cold, and then there'll be two of you to take care of. You don't help a mite doing so, you
needn't think you do."

When Abby caught sight of Ellen she hastened forward, while Maria, still coughing, trailed
behind, lifting her little, heavy, snow-bound feet wearily.

"Ellen, I wish you'd tell Maria to turn around and go home," she said. "Just hear her cough,
and out in all this snow, and getting her skirts draggled. She hasn't got common-sense, you
tell her so."

Ellen stopped, nodding assentingly. "I think she's right, Maria," she said. "You ought not
to be out such a morning as this. You had better go home."

Maria came up smiling, though her lips were quite white, and she controlled her cough to convulsive
motions of her chest.

"I am no worse than usual," said she. "I feel better than I generally do in the morning. I
haven't coughed any more, if I have as much, and I am holding my dress up high, and you know
how warm the factory is. It will be enough sight warmer than it is at home. It is cold at home."

"Lloyd don't have to save coal," said Abby, bitterly, "but that don't alter the fact of your
getting your skirts draggled."

Maria pulled up her skirts so high that she exposed her slender ankles, then seeing that she
had done so, she let them fall with a quick glance at two men behind them.

"The snow will shake right off; it's light, Abby," she said.

"It ain't light. I should think you might listen to Ellen, if you won't to me."

Ellen pressed close to Maria, and pulled her thin arm through her own. "Look here," she said,
"don't you think--"

Then Maria burst out with a pitiful emphasis. "I've got to go," she said. "Father had a bad
spell last night; he can't get out. He'll lose his place this time, we are afraid, and there's
a note coming due that father says he's paid, but the man didn't give it up, and he's got to
pay it over again; the lawyer says there is no other way, and we can't let John Sargent do
everything. He's got a sister out West he's about supporting since her husband died last fall.
I've got to go to work; we've got to have the money, Ellen, and as for my cough, I have always
coughed. Stephen began to see light--rather a lurid light.

"Yes. His name was Cassim ben Halim el Cheikh el Arab. Before he had known Saidee two weeks,
he proposed. She took a little while to think it over, and I begged her to say 'no'--but one day
when Mrs. Ray had been crosser and more horrid than usual, she said
'yes'.

Cassim ben Halim was Mohammedan, of course, but he and Saidee were married according to French
law.

They didn't go to church, because he couldn't do that without showing
disrespect to his own religion, but he promised he'd not try to change
hers.

Altogether it seemed to Saidee that there was no reason why they shouldn't be as happy as a Catholic
girl marrying a Protestant--or vice versa; and she hadn't any very strong convictions. She was a
Christian, but she wasn't fond of going to church."

"And her promise that she'd take you away with her?" Stephen reminded the girl.

"She would have kept it, if Mrs. Ray had consented--though I'm sure Cassim didn't want me, and
only agreed to do what Saidee asked because he was so deep in love, and feared to lose my sister
if he refused her anything.

But Mrs. Ray was afraid to let me go, on account of the condition
in father's will that she should keep me near her while I was being
educated.

There was an old friend of father's who'd threatened to try and upset
the will, for Saidee's sake and mine, so I suppose she thought he
might succeed if she disobeyed father's instructions.

It ended in Saidee and her husband going to Algiers without me, and
Saidee cried--but she couldn't help being happy, because she was in
love, and very excited about the strange new life, which Cassim told
her would be wonderful as some gorgeous dream of fairyland.

He gave her quantities of jewellery, and said they were nothing to
what she should have when she was in her own home with him.

She should be covered from head to foot with diamonds and pearls, rubies and emeralds, if she liked;
and of course she would like, for she loved jewels, poor darling."

"Why do you say 'poor?'" asked Stephen.

"Are you going to tell me the marriage wasn't a success?"

"I don't know," answered the girl.

"I don't know any more about her than if Cassim ben Halim had really carried my sister off
to fairyland, and shut the door behind them. You see, I was only eight years old. I couldn't
make my own life. After Saidee was married and taken to Algiers, my stepmother began to imagine
herself in love with an American from Indiana, whom she met in Paris.

He had an impressive sort of manner, and made her think him rich
and important.

He was in business, and had come over to rest, so he couldn't stay long abroad; and he urged
Mrs. Ray to go back to America on the same ship with him.

Of course she took me, and this Mr. Henry Potter told her about a
boarding-school where they taught quite little girls, not far from
the town where he lived.

It had been a farmhouse once, and he said there were 'good teachers
and good air.' I can hear him saying it now.

It was easy to persuade her; and she engaged rooms at a hotel in the town near by, which was
called Potterston, after Mr. Potter's grandfather. By and by they were married, but their marriage
made no difference to me.

It wasn't a bad little old-fashioned school, and I was as happy as
I could be anywhere, parted from Saidee.

There was an attic where I used to be allowed to sit on Saturdays, and think thoughts, and
write letters to my sister; and there was one corner, where the sunlight came in through a tiny window
shaped like a crescent, without any glass, which I named Algiers. I played that I went there
to visit Saidee in the old Arab palace she wrote me about. It was a splendid play--but I felt
lonely when I stopped playing it. I used to dance there, too, very softly in stockinged feet,
so nobody could hear--dances she and I made up together out of stories she used to tell me. The Shadow
Dance and the Statue Dance which you saw, came out of those stories, and there are more you didn't
see, which I do sometimes--a butterfly dance, the dance of the wheat, and two of the East, which
were in stories she told me after we knew Cassim ben Halim. They are the dance of the smoke wreath,
and the dance of the jewel-and-the-rose. I could dance quite well even in those days, because
I loved doing it. It came as natural to dance as to breathe, and Saidee had always encouraged
me, so when I was left alone it made me think of her, to dance the dances of her stories."

"What about your teachers? Did they never find you out?" asked Stephen.

"Yes. One of the young teachers did at last. Not in the attic, but when I was dancing for the
big girls in their dormitory, at night--they'd wake me up to get me to dance. But she wasn't
much older than the biggest of the big girls, so she laughed--I suppose I must have looked quaint
dancing in my nighty, with my long red hair. And though we were all scolded afterwards, I was
made to dance sometimes at the entertainments we gave when school broke up in the summer.
I was the youngest scholar, you see, and stayed through the vacations, so I was a kind of
pet for the teachers. They were of one family, aunts and nieces--Southern people, and of course
good-natured. But all this isn't really in the story I want to tell you. The interesting part's
about Saidee. For months I got letters from her, written from Algiers. At first they were like
fairy tales, but by and by--quite soon--they stopped telling much about herself. It seemed as if
Saidee were growing more and more reserved, or else as if she were tired of writing to me,
and bored by it--almost as if she could hardly think of anything to say. Then the letters stopped
altogether. I wrote and wrote, but no answer came--no answer ever came."

"You've never heard from your sister since then?" The thing appeared incredible to Stephen.

"Never. Now you can guess what I've been growing up for, living for, all these years. To find
her."

"But surely," Stephen argued, "there must have been some way to----"

"Not any way that was in my power, till now. You see I was helpless.
I had no money, and I was a child.

I'm not very old yet, but I'm older than my years, because I had this thing to do. There I was,
at a farmhouse school in the country, two miles out of Potterston--and you would think Potterston
itself not much better than the backwoods, I'm sure. When I was fourteen, my stepmother died suddenly--leaving
all the money which came from my father to her husband, except several thousand dollars to
finish my education and give me a start in life; but Mr. Potter lost
everything of his own and of mine too, in some wild speculation about
which the people in that part of Indiana went mad.

The crash came a year ago, and the Misses Jennings, who kept the
school, asked me to stay on as an under teacher--they were sorry for
me, and so kind.

But even if nothing had happened, I should have left then, for I
felt old enough to set about my real work.

Oh, I see you think I might have got at my sister before, somehow, but I couldn't, indeed. I
tried everything. Not only did I write and write, but I begged the Misses Jennings to help,
and the minister of the church where we went on Sundays. The Misses Jennings told the girls'
parents and relations whenever they came to visit, and they all promised, if they ever went to Algiers,
they would look for my sister's husband, Captain Cassim ben Halim,
of the Spahis.

But they weren't the sort of people who ever do go such journeys. And the minister wrote to
the American Consul in Algiers for me, but the only answer was that
Cassim ben Halim had disappeared.

It seemed not even to be known that he had an American wife."

"Your stepmother ought to have gone herself," said Stephen.

"Oh--ought! I very seldom saw my stepmother after she married Mr.
Potter.

Though she lived so near, she never asked me to her house, and only
came to call at the school once or twice a year, for form's sake.

But I ran away one evening and begged her to go and find Saidee. She said it was nonsense; that
if Saidee hadn't wanted to drop us, she would have kept on writing,
or else she was dead.

But don't you think I should have known if Saidee were dead?"

"By instinct, you mean--telepathy, or something of that sort?"

"I don't know what I mean, but I should have known.

I should have felt her death, like a string snapping in my heart.

Instead, I heard her calling to me--I hear her always. She wants me. She needs me. I know
it, and nothing could make me believe otherwise.

So now you understand how, if anything were to be done, I had to
do it myself.

When I was quite little, I thought by the time I should be sixteen or seventeen, and allowed to
leave school--or old enough to run away if necessary--I'd have a
little money of my own.

But when my stepmother died I felt sure I should never, never get
anything from Mr. Potter."

"But that old friend you spoke of, who wanted to upset the will? Couldn't he have done anything?"
Stephen asked.

"If he had lived, everything might have been different; but he was a very old man, and he died
of pneumonia soon after Saidee married Cassim ben Halim.

There was no one else to help. So from the time I was fourteen, I knew that somehow I must make
money. Without money I could never hope to get to Algiers and find Saidee. Even though she had
disappeared from there, it seemed to me that Algiers would be the place to begin my search. Don't
you think so?"

"Yes, Algiers is the place to begin," Stephen echoed. "There ought to be a way of tracking
her. Some one must know what became of a more or less important man
such as your brother-in-law seems to have been.

It's incredible that he should have been able to vanish without leaving any trace."

"He must have left a trace, and though nobody else, so far, has found it, I shall find it,"
said the girl. "I did what I could before. I asked everybody to help; and when I got to New York
last year, I used to go to Cook's office, to inquire for people travelling to Algiers. Then, if
I met any, I would at once speak of my sister, and give them my address, to let me know if they
should discover anything. They always seemed interested, and said they would really do their
best, but they must have failed, or else they forgot. No news ever came back. It will be different
with me now, though.

I shall find Saidee, and if she isn't happy, I shall bring her away
with me.

If her husband is a bad man, and if the reason he left Algiers is because he lost his money,
as I sometimes think, I may have to bribe him to let her go. But I have money enough for everything,
I hope--unless he's very greedy, or there are difficulties I can't
foresee.

In that case, I shall dance again, and make more money, you know--that's all there is about
it."

"One thing I do know, is that you are wonderful," said Stephen, his
conscience pricking him because of certain unjust thoughts concerning
this child which he had harboured since learning that she was a dancer.

"You're the most wonderful girl I ever saw or heard of."

She laughed happily.

"Oh no, I'm not wonderful at all.

It's funny you should think so.

Perhaps none of the girls you know have had a big work to do."

"I'm sure they never have," said Stephen, "and if they had, they wouldn't have done it."

"Yes, they would. Anybody would--that is, if they wanted to, enough. You can always do what
you want to enough. I wanted to do this with all my heart and soul, so I knew I should find
the way. I just followed my instinct, when people told me I was unreasonable, and of course
it led me right. Reason is only to depend on in scientific sorts
of things, isn't it?

The other is higher, because instinct is your You."

"Isn't that what people say who preach New Thought, or whatever they call it?" asked Stephen. "A
lot of women I know had rather a craze about that two or three years
ago.

They went to lectures given by an American man they raved over--said he was 'too fascinating.'
And they used their 'science' to win at bridge.

I don't know whether it worked or not."

"I never heard any one talk of New Thought," said Victoria. "I've just had my own thoughts about
everything. The attic at school was a lovely place to think thoughts in. Wonderful ones always
came to me, if I called to them--thoughts all glittering--like angels.

They seemed to bring me new ideas about things I'd been born knowing--beautiful things, which
I feel somehow have been handed down to me--in my blood."

"Why, that's the way my friends used to talk about 'waking their race-consciousness.'
But it only led to bridge, with them."

"Well, it's led me from Potterston here," said Victoria, "and it will
lead me on to the end, wherever that may be, I'm sure.

Perhaps it will lead me far, far off, into that mysterious golden
silence, where in dreams I often see Saidee watching for me: the strangest
dream-place, and I've no idea where it is!

But I shall find out, if she is really there."

"What supreme confidence you have in your star!"

Stephen exclaimed, admiringly, and half enviously.

"Of course. Haven't you, in yours?"

"I have no star."

She turned her eyes to his, quickly, as if grieved. And in his eyes she saw the shadow of hopelessness
which was there to see, and could not be hidden from a clear gaze.

"I'm sorry," she said simply. "I don't know how I could have lived
without mine.

I walk in its light, as if in a path.

But yours must be somewhere in the sky, and you can find it if you want
 to very much."

He could have found two in her eyes just then, but such stars were
not for him.

"Perhaps I don't deserve a star," he said.

"I'm sure you do. You are the kind that does," the girl comforted him. "Do have a star!"

"It would only make me unhappy, because I mightn't be able to walk in its light, as you do."

"It would make you very happy, as mine does me.

I'm always happy, because the light helps me to do things.

It helped me to dance: it helped me to succeed."

"Tell me about your dancing," said Stephen, vaguely anxious to change
the subject, and escape from thoughts of Margot, the only star of
his future.

"I should like to hear how you began, if you don't mind."

"That's kind of you," replied Victoria, gratefully.

He laughed. "Kind!"

"Why, it's nothing of a story. Luckily, I'd always danced. So when I was fourteen, and began to
think I should never have any money of my own after all, I saw that dancing would be my best
way of earning it, as that was the one thing I could do very well. Afterwards I worked in real earnest--always
up in the attic, where I used to study the Arabic language too; study it very hard. And no
one knew what I was doing or what was in my head, till last year when I told the oldest Miss
Jennings that I couldn't be a teacher--that I must leave school and go to New York."

"What did she say?"

"She said I was crazy. So did they all. They got the minister to come and argue with me, and he was
dreadfully opposed to my wishes at first.

But after we'd talked a while, he came round to my way."

"How did you persuade him to that point of view?"

Stephen catechized her, wondering always.

"I hardly know.

I just told him how I felt about everything. Oh, and I danced."

"By Jove! What effect had that on him?"

"He clapped his hands and said it was a good dance, quite different
from what he expected.

He didn't think it would do any one harm to see. And he gave me a sort of lecture about how
I ought to behave if I became a dancer. It was easy to follow his advice, because none of the
bad things he feared might happen to me ever did."

"Your star protected you?"

"Of course. There was a little trouble about money at first, because I hadn't any, but I had
a few things--a watch that had been my mother's, and her engagement
ring (they were Saidee's, but she left them both for me when she went
away), and a queer kind of brooch Cassim ben Halim gave me one day,
out of a lovely mother-o'-pearl box he brought full of jewels for
Saidee, when they were engaged.

See, I have the brooch on now--for I wouldn't sell the things. I went to a shop in Potterston
and asked the man to lend me fifty dollars on them all, so he did. It was very good of him."

"You
seem to consider everybody you meet kind and good," Stephen said.

"Yes, they almost always have been so to me. If you believe people
are going to be good, it makes them good, unless they're very bad
indeed."

"Perhaps."

Stephen would not for a great deal have tried to undermine her confidence
in her fellow beings, and such was the power of the girl's personality,
that for the moment he was half inclined to feel she might be right.

Who could tell? Maybe he had not "believed" enough--in Margot. He looked with interest at the
brooch of which Miss Ray spoke, a curiously wrought, flattened ring
of dull gold, with a pin in the middle which pierced and fastened
her chiffon veil on her breast.

Round the edge, irregularly shaped pearls alternated with roughly
cut emeralds, and there was a barbaric beauty in both workmanship
and colour.

"What happened when you got to your journey's end?" he went on, fearing
to go astray on that subject of the world's goodness, which was a
sore point with him lately.

"Did you know anybody in New York?"

"Nobody. But I asked the driver of a cab if he could take me to a
respectable theatrical boarding-house, and he said he could, so I
told him to drive me there.

I engaged a wee back room at the top of the house, and paid a week
in advance.

The boarders weren't very successful people, poor things, for it
was a cheap boarding-house--it had to be, for me.

But they all knew which were the best theatres and managers, and
they were interested when they heard I'd come to try and get a chance
to be a dancer.

They were afraid it wasn't much use, but the same evening they changed
their minds, and gave me lots of good advice."

"You danced for them?"

"Yes, in such a stuffy parlour, smelling of gas and dust and there
were holes in the carpet it was difficult not to step into.

A dear old man without any hair, who was on what he called the 'Variety
Stage,' advised me to go and try to see Mr. Charles Norman, a fearfully
important person--so important that even I had heard of him, away
out in Indiana.

I did try, day after day, but he was too important to be got at.

I wouldn't be discouraged, though.

I knew Mr. Norman must come to the theatre sometimes, so I bought a photograph in order to recognize
him; and one day when he passed me, going in, I screwed up my courage
and spoke.

I said I'd been waiting for days and days. At first he scowled, and I think meant to be cross,
but when he'd given me one long, terrifying glare, he grumbled out: "Come along with me, then.
I'll soon see what you can do." I went in, and danced on an almost dark stage, with Mr. Norman and another
man looking at me, in the empty theatre where all the chairs and boxes were covered up with
sheets. They seemed rather pleased with my dancing, and Mr. Norman said he would give me a chance.
Then, if I 'caught on'--he meant if people liked me--I should have a salary. But I told him I must
have the salary at once, as my money would only last a few more days.

I'd spent nearly all I had, getting to New York. Very well, said he, I should have thirty dollars
a week to begin with, and after that, we'd see what we'd see. Well, people did like my dances,
and by and by Mr. Norman gave me what seemed then a splendid salary. So now you know everything
that's happened; and please don't think I'd have worried you by talking
so much about myself, if you hadn't asked questions.

I'm afraid I oughtn't to have done it, anyway."

Her tone changed, and became almost apologetic.

She stirred uneasily in her deck chair, and looked about half dazedly, as people look about
a room that is new to them, on waking there for the first time.

"Why, it's grown dark!" she exclaimed.

This fact surprised Stephen equally.

"So it has," he said.

"By Jove, I was so interested in you--in what you were telling--I hadn't noticed. I'd forgotten
where we were."

"I'd forgotten, too," said Victoria.

"I always do forget outside things when I think about Saidee, and
the golden dream-silence where I see her. All the people who were
near us on deck have gone away. Did you see them go?"

"No," said
Stephen, "I didn't."

"How odd!" exclaimed the girl.

"Do you think
so? You had taken me to the golden silence with you."

"Where can
everybody be?" She spoke anxiously. "Is it late? Maybe they've gone
to get ready for dinner."

From a small bag she wore at her belt,
American tourist-fashion, she pulled out an old-fashioned gold watch
of the kind that winds up with a key--her mother's, perhaps, on which
she had borrowed money to reach New York. "Something must be wrong
with my watch," she said. "It can't be twenty minutes past eight."

The
same thing was wrong with Stephen's expensive repeater, whose splendour
he was ashamed to flaunt beside the modesty of the girl's poor little
timepiece. There remained now no reasonable doubt that it was indeed
twenty minutes past eight, since by the mouths of two witnesses a
truth can be established.

"How dreadful!" exclaimed Victoria, mortified.
"I've kept you here all this time, listening to me."

"Didn't I tell
you I'd rather listen to you than anything else? Eating was certainly
not excepted. I don't remember hearing the bugle."

"And I didn't
hear it."

"I'd forgotten dinner. You had carried me so far away with
you."

"And Saidee," added the girl. "Thank you for going with us."

"Thank
you for taking me."

They both laughed, and as they laughed, people
began streaming out on deck. Dinner was over. The handsome Arab passed,
talking with the spare, loose-limbed English parson, whom he had fascinated.
They were discussing affairs in Morocco, and as they passed Stephen
and Victoria, the Arab did not appear to turn; yet Stephen knew that
he was thinking of them and not of what he was saying to the clergyman.

"What
shall we do?" asked Victoria.

Stephen reflected for an instant. "Will
you invite me to dine at your table?" he asked.

"Maybe they'll tell
us it's too late now to have anything to eat. I don't mind for myself,
but for you----"

"We'll have a better dinner than the others have
had," Stephen prophesied. "I guarantee it, if you invite me."

"Oh,
do please come," she implored, like a child. "I couldn't face the
waiters alone. And you know, I feel as if you were a friend, now--though
you may laugh at that."

"It's the best compliment I ever had," said
Stephen. "And--it gives me faith in myself--which I need."

"And your
star, which you're to find," the girl reminded him, as he unrolled
her from her rug.

"I shouldn't think there would be any doubt."

"Well, I don't know. It is a pretty serious thing to get out of work in midwinter for a good
many of us, and as long as the union isn't in control, other men can come in. I don't know."

"I know," said Ellen.

"You mean--?"

"I mean that I do not think it right, that it is unjust, and I believe in resisting injustice."

"Men have resisted injustice ever since the Creation," said Granville, in a bitter voice.

"Well, resistance can continue as long as life lasts," returned Ellen. Just then came a fiercer
blast than ever, laden with a stinging volley of snow, and seemed to sweep the words from the
girl's mouth. She bent before it involuntarily, and the conviction forced itself upon her that,
after all, resistance to injustice might be as futile as resistance to storm, that injustice
might be one of the primal forces of the world, and one of the conditions of its endurance,
and yet with the conviction came the renewed resolution to resist.

"What can poor men do against capital unless they are backed up by some labor organization?"
asked Granville. "And I don't believe there are a dozen in the factory who belong to the union.
There has been an understanding, without his ever saying so that I know of, that the old boss
didn't approve of it. So lots of us kept out of it, we wanted work so bad. What can we do against
such odds?"

"When right is on your side, you have all the odds," said Ellen, looking back over her snow-powdered
shoulder.

"Then you would strike?"

"I wouldn't submit."

"Well, I don't know how the boys feel," said Granville. "I suppose we'll have to talk it over."

"I shouldn't need to talk it over," said Ellen. "You've gone past your house, Granville."

"I ain't going to let you go home alone in such a storm as this," said Granville, in a tender
voice, which he tried to make facetious. "I wouldn't let any girl go home alone in such a storm."

Ellen stopped short. "I don't want you to go home with me, thank you, Granville," she said.
"Your mother will have supper ready, and I can go just as well alone."

"Ellen, I won't let you go alone," said the young man, as a wilder gust came. "Suppose you
should fall down?"

"Fall down!" repeated Ellen, with a laugh, but her regard of the young man, in spite of her
rebuff, was tender. He touched her with his unfailing devotion; the heavy trudging by her side
of this poor man meant, she told herself, much more than the invitation of the rich one to
ride behind his bays in his luxurious sleigh. This meant the very bone and sinew of love. She
held out her little, mittened hand to him.

"Good-night, Granville," she said.

Granville caught it eagerly. "Oh, Ellen," he murmured.

But she withdrew her hand quickly. "We have always been good friends, and we always will be,"
said she, and her tone was unmistakable. The young man shrank back.

"Yes, we always will, Ellen," he said, in a faithful voice, with a note of pain in it.

"Good-night," said Ellen again.

"Good-night," responded Granville, and turned his plodding back on the girl and retraced his
laborious steps towards his own home, which he had just passed. There come times for all souls
when the broad light of the path of humanity seems to pale to insignificance before the intensity
of the one little search-light of personality. Granville Joy felt as if the eternal problem
of the rich and poor, of labor and capital, of justice and equality, was as nothing before
the desire of his heart for that one girl who was disappearing from his sight behind the veil
of virgin snow.

Chapter L

When Ellen came in sight of her house that night she saw her father's bent figure moving down
the path with sidewise motions of a broom. He had been out at short intervals all the afternoon,
that she should not have to wade through drifts to the door. The electric-light shone full
on this narrow, cleared track and the toiling figure.

"Hullo, father!" Ellen called out. Andrew turned, and his face lit with love and welcome and
solicitude.

"Be you dreadful snowy?" he asked.

"Oh no, father, not very."

"It's an awful storm."

"Pretty bad, but I got along all right. The snow-plough has been out."

"Wait a minute till I get this swept," said Andrew, sweeping violently before her.

"You needn't have bothered, father," said Ellen.

"I 'ain't anything else to do," replied Andrew, in a sad voice.

"There's mother watching," said Ellen.

"Yes, she's been diggin' at them wrappers all day."

"I suppose she has," Ellen returned, in a bitter tone. Her father stared at her. Ellen never
spoke like that. For the first time she echoed him and her mother. Something like terror came
over him at the sound of that familiar note of his own life from this younger one. He seemed
to realize dimly that a taint of his nature had descended upon his child.

When Ellen entered the house, the warm air was full of savory odors of toast and tea and cooking
meat and vegetables.

"You'd better go right up-stairs and put on a dry dress, Ellen," said Fanny. "I put your blue
one out on your bed, and your shoes are warming by the sitting-room stove. I've been worrying
as to how you were going to get home all day."  Then she stopped short as she caught sight
of Ellen's face. "What on earth is the matter, Ellen Brewster?" she said.

"Nothing," said Ellen. "Why?"

"You look queer. Has anything happened?"

"Yes, something has happened."

"What?"

Andrew turned pale. He stood in the entry with his snowy broom in hand, staring from one to
the other.

"Nothing that you need worry about," said Ellen. "I'll tell you when I get my dress changed."

Ellen pulled off her rubbers, and went up-stairs to her chamber. Fanny and Andrew stood looking
at each other.

"You don't suppose--" whispered Andrew.

"Suppose what?" responded Fanny, sharply.

They continued to look at each other. Fanny answered Andrew as if he had spoken, with that
jealous pride for her girl's self-respect which possessed her even before the girl's father.

"Land, it ain't that," said she. "You wouldn't catch Ellen lookin' as if anything had come
across her for such a thing as that."

"No, I suppose she wouldn't," said Andrew; and he actually blushed before his wife's eyes.

That afternoon Mrs. Wetherhed had been in, and told Fanny that she had heard that Robert Lloyd
was to be married to Maud Hemingway; and both Andrew and Fanny had thought of that as the cause
of Ellen's changed face.

"You'd better take that broom out into the shed, and get the snow off yourself, and come in
and shut the door," Fanny said, shortly. "You're colding the house all off, and Amabel has
got a cold, and she's sitting right in the draught."

"All right," replied Andrew, meekly, though Fanny had herself been holding the sitting-room
door open. In those days Andrew felt below his moral stature as head of the house. Actually,
looking at Fanny, who was earning her small share towards the daily bread, she seemed to him
much taller than he, though she was a head shorter. He thought so little of himself, he seemed
to see himself as through the wrong end of a telescope. Fanny went into the sitting-room and
shut the door with a bang. Amabel did not look up from her book. She was reading a library
book much beyond her years, and sniffing pathetically with her cold. Amabel had begun to discover
an omnivorous taste for books, which stuck at nothing. She understood not more than half of
what she read, but seemed to relish it like indigestible food.

When Ellen came down-stairs, and sat beside the coal stove to change her shoes, she looked
at the book which Amabel was reading. "You ought not to read that book, dear," she said. "Let
Ellen get you a better one for a little girl to-morrow."

But Amabel, without paying the slightest heed to Ellen's words, looked up at her with amazement,
as Andrew and Fanny had done. "What's the matter, Ellen?" she asked, in her little, hoarse voice.

Fanny and Andrew, who had just entered, stood waiting. Ellen bent over her shoe, drawing in
the strings firmly and evenly.

"Mr. Lloyd has reduced the wage-list," she said.

"How much?" asked Andrew, in a hoarse voice.

"Ten per cent."

There was a dead silence. Andrew and Fanny looked at Ellen like people who are uncertain of
their next move; Amabel stared from one to the other with her weak, watery eyes. Ellen continued
to lace her shoes.

"What do you think about it, Ellen?" asked Andrew, almost timidly.

"I know of only one thing to think," replied Ellen, in a dogged voice.

As she spoke she pulled the tag off a shoe-string because it would not go through the eyelet.

"What is that?" asked Fanny, in a hard voice.

"I think it is cruelty and tyranny," said Ellen, pulling the rough end of the string through
the eyelet.

"I suppose the times are pretty hard," ventured Andrew; but Ellen cut him short.

"Robert Lloyd has half a million, which has been accumulated by the labor of poor men in prosperous
times," said she, with her childlike severity and pitilessness. "There is no question about
the matter."

Then Fanny flung all self-interest to the wind and was at her daughter's side like a whirlwind.
The fact that the two were of one blood was never so strongly evident. Red spots glowed in
the elder woman's cheeks and her black eyes blazed.

"Ellen's right," said she; "she's right. For a man worth half a million to cut down the wages
of poor, hard-working folks in midwinter is cruelty. I don't care who does it."

"Yes, it is," said Ellen.

Fanny opened her mouth to tell Ellen of the rumor concerning Robert's engagement to Maud Hemingway,
then she refrained, for some reason which she could not analyze. In her heart she did not believe
the report to be true, and considered the telling of it a slight to Ellen, but it influenced
her in her indignation against Robert for the wage-cutting.

"What are they going to do?" asked Andrew.

"I don't know," replied Ellen.

"Did he--young Lloyd--talk to the men?"

"No; notices were tacked up all over the shop."

"That was the way his uncle would have done," said Andrew, in a curious voice of bitterness
and respect.

"So you don't know what they are going to do?" said Fanny.

"No."

"Well, I know what I would do," said Fanny. "I never would give in, if I starved--never!"

Chapter LI

When Ellen started for the factory the next morning the storm had not ceased; the roads were
very heavy, although the snow-plough had been out at intervals all night, and there was a struggling
line of shovelling men along the car-track, but the cars were still unable to penetrate the
drifts. When Ellen passed her grandmother's house the old woman tapped sharply on the window
and motioned her back frantically with one bony hand. The window was frozen to the sill with
the snow, and she could not raise it. Ellen shook her head, smiling. Her grandmother continued
to wave her back, the lines of forbidding anxiety in her old face as strongly marked as an
etching in the window frame. This love, which had at once coerced and fondled the girl since
her birth, was very precious to her. This protection, which she was forced to repel, smote
her like a pain.

"Poor old grandmother!" she thought; "there she will worry about me all day because I have
gone out in the storm."  She turned back and waved her hand and nodded laughingly; but the
old woman continued that anxiously imperative backward motion until Ellen was out of sight.

Ellen walked in the car-track, as did everybody else, that being better cleared than the rest
of the road. She was astonished that she heard nothing of the cut in wages from the men. There
seemed to be no excitement at all. They merely trudged heavily along, their whitening bodies
bent before the storm. Second. Mind works by individual and not ancestral experience.

Third. Instinct is sometimes an original endowment.

Now, can we or any others tell how it is that mind depends, just like instinct, wholly upon brain
structure, and is, at the same time, unlike instinct in that it is wholly dependent on individual,
not ancestral experience? And if mind or intelligence does not depend on ancestral experience,
how is its origin to be accounted for on the hypothesis of heredity through evolution of species,
starting, without life, instinct or mind, by blind forces operating on dead matter, and the forces
themselves simply the forces of dead matter? The capacity for intellectual improvement is a remarkable
peculiarity of man's nature. The instinctive habits of the lower animals are limited, are peculiar
to each species, and have immediate reference to their bodily wants. Where a particular adaptation
of means to ends, of actions to circumstances, is made by an individual the rest do not seem to profit
by that experience, so that, although the instincts of particular
animals may be modified by the training of man, or by the education
of circumstances, so as to show themselves after a few generations
under new forms, no elevation of intelligence ever appears to take
place spontaneously, no physical improvement is manifested in the
species at large.

On the other hand, we observe in man not merely the capability of profiting by experience, but the
determination to do so, which he is enabled to put into action by the power which his will,
when properly disciplined, comes to possess, of directing and controlling
his current of thought by fixing his attention upon any subject which
he desires to keep before his mental vision.

This power, so far as we know, is peculiar to man, and the presence
or absence of it constitutes the difference between a being possessed
of powers to determine his own course of thought and action, and a
mere thinking automaton.--Carpenter's Physiology.

 "You don't mean--" she said, as they climbed up the stairs.

"I mean I would do anything, at whatever cost to myself, to defeat injustice," said Ellen,
in a loud, clear voice.

Several men turned and looked back at her and laughed bitterly.

"It's easy talking," said one to another.

"That's so," returned the other.

The people all settled to their work as usual. One of the foremen (Dennison), who was anxious
to curry favor with his employer, reported to him in an undertone in the office that everything
was quiet. Robert nodded easily. He had not anticipated anything else. In the course of the
morning he looked into the room where Ellen was employed, and saw with relief and concern her
fair head before her machine. It seemed to him that he could not bear it one instant longer
to have her working in this fashion, that he must lift her out of it. He still tingled with
his rebuff of the night before, but he had never loved her so well, for the idea that the cut
in wages affected her relation to him never occurred to him. As he walked through the room
none of the workers seemed to notice him, but worked with renewed energy. He might have been
invisible for all the attention he seemed to excite. He looked with covert tenderness at the
back of Ellen's head, and passed on. He reflected that he had adopted the measure of wage-cutting
with no difficulty whatever.

"All it needs is a little firmness," he thought, with a boyish complacency in his own methods.
"Now I can keep on with the factory, and no turning the poor people adrift in midwinter."

At noon Robert put on his fur-lined coat and left the factory, springing into the sleigh, which
had drawn up before the door with a flurry of bells. He had an errand in the next town that
afternoon, and was not going to return. When the sleigh had slid swiftly out of sight through
the storm, which was lightening a little, the people in the office turned to one another with
a curious expression of liberty, but even then little was said. Nellie Stone was at the desk
eating her luncheon; Ed Flynn and Dennison and one of the lasters, who had looked in and then
stepped in when he saw Lloyd was gone, were there. The laster, who was young and coarsely handsome,
had an admiration for the pretty girl at the desk. Presently she addressed him, with her mouth
full of apple-pie.

"Say, George, what are you fellows going to do?" she asked.

Dennison glanced keenly from one to the other; Flynn shrugged his shoulders and looked out
of the window.

"Looks as if it was clearing up," he remarked.

"What are you going to do?" asked Nellie Stone again, with a coquettish flirt of her blond
fluff of hair.

"Grin and bear it, I s'pose," replied the young laster, with an adoring look at her.

"My land! grin and bear a cut of ten per cent.? Well, I don't think you've got much spunk,
I must say. Why don't you strike?"

"Who's going to feed us?" replied the laster, in a tender voice.

"Feed you? Oh, you don't want much to eat. Join the union. It's ridiculous so few of the men
in Lloyd's belong to it, anyway; and then the union will feed you, won't it?"

"The union did not do what it promised in the Scarboro strike," interposed Dennison, curtly.

"Oh, we all know where you are, Frank Dennison," said the girl, with a soft roll of her blue
eyes. "Besides, it's easy to talk when you aren't hit. Your wages aren't cut. But here is George
May here, he's in a different box."

"He's got nobody dependent on him, anyway," said Flynn.

"If I wasn't going to get married I'd strike," cried the young man, with a fervent glance at
the girl. She colored, half pleased, half angry, and the other men chuckled. She took another
bite of pie to conceal her confusion. She preferred Flynn to the laster, and while she was
not averse to proving to the former the triumph of her charms over another man, did not like
too much concessions.

"You'd better go and eat your dinner, George May," she said, in her sweet, shrill voice. "First
thing you know the whistle will blow. Here's yours, Ed."  With that she pulled out a leather
bag from under the desk, where she had volunteered to place it for warmth and safety against
the coil of steam-pipes.

"I don't believe your coffee is very cold, Ed," said she.

The laster glared from one to the other jealously. Dennison went towards a shelf where he had
stored away his luncheon, when he stopped suddenly and listened, as did the others. There came
a great uproar of applause from the next room beyond. Then it subsided, and a girl's clear,
loud voice was heard.

"What is going on?" cried Nellie Stone. She jumped up and ran to the door, still eating her
pie, and the men followed her.

At the end of one of the work-rooms, backed against a snowy window, clung about with shreds
of the driving storm, stood Ellen Brewster, with some other girls around her, and a few men
on the outskirts, and a steady, curious movement of all the other workmen towards her, as of
iron filings towards a magnet, and she was talking.

Her voice was quite audible all over the great room. It was low-pitched, but had a wonderful
carrying quality, and there was something marvellous in its absolute confidence.

"If you men will do nothing, and say nothing, it is time for a girl to say and act," she proclaimed.
"I did not dream for a minute that you would yield to this cut in wages. Why should you have
your wages cut?"

"The times are pretty hard," said a doubtful voice among her auditors.

"What if the times are hard? What is that to you? Have you made them hard? It is the great
capitalists who have made them hard by shifting the wealth too much to one side. They are the
ones who should suffer, not you. What have you done, except come here morning after morning
in cold or heat, rain or shine, and work with all your strength? They who have precipitated
the hard times are the ones who should bear the brunt of them. Your work is the same now as
it was then, the strain on your flesh and blood and muscles is the same, your pay should be
the same."

"That's so," said Abby Atkins, in a reluctant, surly fashion.

"That's so," said another girl, and another. Then there was a fusilade of hand-claps started
by the girls, and somewhat feebly echoed by the men.

One or two men looked rather uneasily back towards Dennison and Flynn and two more foremen
who had come forward.

"It ain't as though we had something to fall back on," said a man's grumbling voice. "It's
easy to talk when you 'ain't got a wife and five children dependent on you."

"That's so," said another man, doggedly.

"That has nothing to do with it," said Ellen, firmly. "We can all club together, and keep the
wolf from the door for those who are hardest pressed for a while; and as for me, if I were a man--"

She paused a minute. When she spoke again her voice was full of childlike enthusiasm; it seemed
to ring like a song.

"If I were a man," said she, "I would go out in the street and dig--I would beg, I would steal--before
I would yield--I, a free man in a free country--to tyranny like this!"

There was a great round of applause at that. Dennison scowled and said something in a low voice
to another foreman at his side. Flynn laughed, with a perplexed, admiring look at Ellen.

"The question is," said Tom Peel, slouching on the outskirts of the throng, and speaking in
an imperturbable, compelling, drawling voice, "whether the free men in the free country are
going to kick themselves free, or into tighter places, by kicking."

"If you have got to stop to count the cost of bravery and standing up for your rights, there
would be no bravery in the world," returned Ellen, with disdain.

"Oh, I am ready to kick," said Peel, with his mask-like smile.

"So am I," said Granville Joy, in a loud voice. Amos Lee came rushing through the crowd to
Ellen's side. He had been eating his dinner in another room, and had just heard what was going
on. He opened his mouth with a motion as of letting loose a flood of ranting, but somebody
interposed. John Sargent, bulky and irresistible in his steady resolution, put him aside and
stood before him.

"Look here," he said to them all. "There may be truth in what Miss Brewster says, but we must
not act hastily; there is too much at stake. Let us appoint a committee and go to see Mr. Lloyd
this evening, and remonstrate on the cutting of the wages."  He turned to Ellen in a kindly,
half-paternal fashion. "Don't you see it would be better?" he said.

She looked at him doubtfully, her cheeks glowing, her eyes like stars. She was freedom and
youth incarnate, and rebellious against all which she conceived as wrong and tyrannical. She
could hardly admit, in her fire of enthusiasm, of pure indignation, of any compromise or arbitration.
All the griefs of her short life, she had told herself, were directly traceable to the wrongs
of the system of labor and capital, and were awakening within her as freshly as if they had
just happened.

She remembered her father, exiled in his prime from his place in the working world by this
system of arbitrary employment; she remembered her aunt in the asylum; poor little Amabel;
her own mother toiling beyond her strength on underpaid work; Maria coughing her life away.
She remembered her own life twisted into another track from the one which she should have followed,
and there was for the time very little reason or justice in her. That injustice which will
arise to meet its kind in equal combat had arisen in her heart. Still, she yielded. "Perhaps
you are right," she said to Sargent. She had always liked John Sargent, and she respected him.

"I am sure it is the best course," he said to her, still in that low, confidential voice.

It ended in a committee of four--John Sargent, Amos Lee, Tom Peel, and one of the older lasters,
a very respectable man, a deacon in the Baptist Church--being appointed to wait on Robert Lloyd
that evening.

When the one-o'clock whistle blew, Ellen went back to her machine. She was very pale, but she
was conscious of a curious steadiness of all her nerves. Abby leaned towards her, and spoke
low in the roar of wheels.

"I'll back you up, if I die for it," she said.

But Sadie Peel, on the other side, spoke quite openly, with a laugh and shrug of her shoulders.
"Land," she said, "father'll be with you. He's bound to strike. He struck when he was in McGuire's.
Catch father givin' up anything. But as for me, I wish you'd all slow up an' stick to work,
if you do get a little less. If we quit work I can't have a nearseal cape, and I've set my
heart on a nearseal cape this winter."

Chapter LII

Ellen resolved that she would say as little as possible about the trouble at home that night.
She did not wish her parents to worry over it until it was settled in one way or another.

When her mother asked what they had done about the wage-cutting, she replied that a committee
had been appointed to wait on Mr. Lloyd that evening, and talk it over with him; then she said
nothing more.

"He won't give in if he's like his uncle," said Fanny.

Ellen went on eating her supper in silence. Her father glanced at her with sharp solicitude.

"Maybe he will," said he.

"No, he won't," returned Fanny.

Ellen was very pale and her eyes were bright. After supper she went to the window and pressed
her face against the glass, shielding her eyes from the in-door light, and saw that the storm
had quite ceased. The stars were shining and the white boughs of the trees lashing about in
the northwest wind. She went into the entry, where she had hung her hat and coat, and began
putting them on.

"Where are you going, Ellen?" asked her mother.

"Just down to Abby's a minute."

"You don't mean to say your are goin' out again in this snow, Ellen Brewster? I should think
you were crazy."  When Fanny said crazy, she suddenly started and shuddered as if she had struck
herself. She thought of Eva. Always the possibility of a like doom was in her own mind.

"It has stopped snowing, mother," Ellen said.

"Stopped snowing! What if it has? The roads ain't cleared. You can't get down to Abby Atkins's
without gettin' wet up to your knees. I should think if you got into the house after such a
storm you'd have sense enough to stay in. I've worried just about enough."

Ellen took off her coat and hat and hung them up again. "Well, I won't go if you feel so, mother,"
she said, patiently.

"It seems as if you might get along without seein' Abby Atkins till to-morrow mornin', when
you'd seen her only an hour ago," Fanny went on, in the high, nagging tone which she often
adopted with those whom she loved the dearest.

"Yes, I can," said Ellen. It seemed to her that she must see somebody with whom she could talk
about the trouble in the factory, but she yielded. There was always with the girl a perfect
surface docility, as that she seemed to have no resistance, but a little way down was a rock-bed
of firmness. She lighted her lamp, and took her library book and went up-stairs to bed to read.
But she could not read, and she could not sleep when she had put aside her book and extinguished
her lamp. She could think of nothing except Robert, and what he would say to the committee.
She lay awake all night thinking of it. Ellen was a girl who was capable of the most devoted
love, and the most intense dissent and indignation towards the same person. She could love
in spite of faults, and she could see faults in spite of love. She thought of Robert Lloyd
as of the one human soul whom she loved best out of the whole world, whom she put before everybody
else, even her own self, and she also thought of him with a wrath which was pitiless and uncompromising,
and which seemed to tear her own heart to pieces, for one cannot be wroth with love without
a set-back of torture. "If he does not give in and raise the wages, I shall hate him," thought
Ellen; and her heart stung her as if at the touch of a hot iron, and then she could have struck
herself for the supposition that he would not give in. "He must," she told herself, with a
great fervor of love. "He must."

But when she went down to breakfast the next morning her mother stared at her sharply.

"Ellen Brewster, what is the matter with you?" she cried.

"Nothing. Why?"

"Nothing! You look like a ghost."

"I feel perfectly well," said Ellen. She made an effort to eat as much breakfast as usual in
order that her mother should not suspect that she was troubled. When at last she set out for
the factory, in the early morning dusk, she was chilled and trembling with excitement.

The storm had quite ceased, and there was a pale rose-and-violet dawn-light in the east, and
presently came effects like golden-feathered shafts shooting over the sky. The road was alive
with shovelling men, construction-cars of the railroad company were laboring back and forth
to clear the tracks, householders were making their way from their doors to their gates, clearing
their paths, lifting up the snow in great, glittering, blue-white blocks on their clumsy shovels.
Everywhere were the factory employés hastening to their labor; the snow was dropping from the
overladen tree branches in great blobs; there was an incessant, shrill chatter of people, and
occasional shouts. It was the rally of mankind after a defeat by a primitive force of nature.
It was the eternal reassertion of human life and a higher organization over the elemental.
Men who had walked doggedly the morning before now moved with a spring of alacrity, although
the road was very heavy. There was a new light in their eyes; their cheeks glowed. Ellen had
no doubt whatever that if Robert Lloyd had not yielded the attitude of the employés of Lloyd's
would be one of resistance. She herself seemed to breathe in resistance to tyranny, and strength
for the right in every breath of the clear, crisp morning air. She felt as if she could trample
on herself and her own weakness, for the sake of justice and the inalienable good of her kind,
with as little hesitation as she trampled on the creaking snow. Yet she trembled with that
deadly chill before a sense of impending fate. When she returned the salutations of her friends
on the road she felt that her lips were stiff.

"You look dreadful queer, Ellen," Abby Atkins said, anxiously, when she joined her. Maria also
was out that morning.

"Have you heard what they are going to do?" Ellen asked, in a sort of breathless fashion.

"You mean about the wage-cutting? Don't look so, Ellen."

Maria pressed close to Ellen, and slid her thin arm through hers.

"Yes," said Ellen. "What did John Sargent say when he got home last night?"

Abby hesitated a second, looking doubtfully at Ellen. "I don't see that there is any need for
you to take all this so much to heart," she said.

"What did he say?"

"Well," Abby replied, reluctantly, "I believe Mr. Lloyd wouldn't give in. Ellen Brewster, for
Heaven's sake, don't look so!"

Ellen walked on, her head high, her face as white as death. Maria clung closely to her, her
own lips quivering.

"What are the men going to do, do you think?" asked Ellen, presently, in a low voice.

"I don't know," replied Abby. "John Sargent seems to think they'll give in. He says he doesn't
know what else they can do. The times are hard. I believe Amos Lee and Tom Peel are for striking,
but he says he doesn't believe the men will support them. The amount of it all is, a man with
money has got it all his own way. It's like fighting with bare hands to oppose him, and getting
yourself cut, and not hurting him at all. He's got all the weapons. We simply can't go without
work all winter. It is better to do with less than with nothing at all. What can a man like
Willy Jones do if he hasn't any work? He and his mother would actually suffer. What could we do?"

"I don't think we ought to think so much about that," said Ellen.

"What do you think we ought to think about, for goodness' sake?"

"Whether we are doing right or not, whether we are furthering the cause of justice and humanity,
or hindering it. Whether it is for good in the long run or not. There have always been martyrs;
I don't see why it is any harder for us to be martyrs than for those we read about."

Sadie Peel came pressing up behind eagerly, her cheeks glowing, holding up her dress, and displaying
a cheap red petticoat. "Ellen Brewster," she exclaimed, "if you dare say anything more to-day
I'm goin' to talk. Father is tearing, though he goes around looking as if he wouldn't jump
at a cannon-ball. Do, for Heaven's sake, keep still; and if you can't get what you want, take
what you can get. I ain't goin' to be cheated out of my nearseal cape, nohow."

"Sadie Peel, you make me tired," cried Abby Atkins. "I don't say that I'm striking, but I'd
strike for all a nearseal cape. I'm ashamed of you."

"I don't care if you be," said the girl, tossing her head. "A nearseal cape means as much to
me as some other things to you. I want Ellen Brewster to hold her tongue."

"Ellen Brewster will hold her tongue or not, just as she has a mind to," responded Abby, with
a snap. She did not like Sadie Peel.

"Oh, stick up for her if you want to, and get us all into trouble."

"I shall stick up for her, you can be mighty sure of that," declared Abby.

Ellen walked on as if she heard nothing of it at all, with little Maria clinging closely to
her. Robert Lloyd got out of his sleigh and went up-stairs just before they reached the factory,
and she heard a very low, subdued mutter of execration.

"They don't mean to strike," she told herself. "They mean to submit."

All went to their tasks as usual. In a minute after the whistle blew the great pile was in
the full hum of labor. Ellen stood for a few moments at her machine, then she left it deliberately,
and made her way down the long room to where John Sargent stood at his bench cutting shoes,
with a swift faithfulness born of long practice. She pressed close to him, while the men around
stared.

"What is going to be done?" she asked, in a low voice.

Sargent turned and looked at her in a troubled fashion, and spoke in a pacific, soothing tone,
as her father might have done. He was much older than Ellen.

"Now look here, child," he said, "I don't dare take the responsibility of urging all these
men into starvation this kind of weather. The times are hard. Lloyd has some reason--"

Ellen walked away from him swiftly and went to the row of lasting-machines where Amos Lee and
Tom Peel stood. She walked up to them and spoke in a loud, clear voice.

"You are not going to give in?" said she. "You don't mean to give in?"

Lee turned and gave her one stare, and left his machine.

"Not another stitch of work will I do under this new wage-list, so help me, God!" he proclaimed.

Tom Peel stood for a second like an automaton, staring at them both. Then he turned back to
his post.

"I'm with ye," he said.

The lasters, for some occult reason, were always the most turbulent element in Lloyd's. In
less than three minutes the enthusiasm of revolt had spread, and every laster had left his
machine. In a half-hour more there was an exodus of workmen from Lloyd's. There were very few
left in the factory. Among them were John Sargent, the laster who was a deacon and had formed
one of the consulting committee, Sadie Peel, who wanted her nearseal cape, and Mamie Brady,
who would do nothing which she thought would displease the foreman, Flynn.

"If father's mind to be such a fool, it's no reason why I should," said Sadie Peel, stitching
determinedly away. Mamie Brady looked at Flynn, when he came up to her, with a gentle, wheedling
smile. There was no one near, and she fancied that he might steal a kiss. But instead he looked
at her, frowning.

"No use you tying away any longer, Mamie," he said. "The strike's on."

Chapter LIII

That was one of the strangest days which Ellen had ever passed. The enforced idleness gave
her an indefinite sense of guilt. She tried to assist her mother about the household tasks,
then she tried to sew on the wrappers, but she was awkward about it, from long disuse.

"Do take your book and sit down and read and rest a little, now you've got a chance," said
Fanny, with sharp solicitude.

She said never one word concerning it to Ellen, but all the time she thought how Ellen had
probably lost her lover. It was really doubtful which suffered the more that day, the mother
or the daughter. Fanny, entirely faithful to her own husband, had yet that strange vicarious
affection for her daughter's lover, and a realization of her state of mind, of which a mother
alone is capable. It is like a cord of birth which is never severed. Not one shadow of sad
reflection passed over the bright enthusiastic face of the girl but was passed on, as if driven
by some wind of spirit, over the face of the older woman. She reflected Ellen entirely.

As for Andrew, his anxiety was as tender, and less subtle. He did not understand so clearly,
but he suffered more. He was clumsy with this mystery of womanhood, but he was unremitting
in his efforts to do something for the girl. Once he tiptoed up to Fanny and whispered, when
Ellen was in the next room, that he hoped she hadn't made any mistake, that it seemed to him
she looked pretty pale.

"Mistake?" cried Fanny, tossing her head, and staring at him proudly. "Haven't you got any
spirit, and you a man, Andrew Brewster?"

"I ain't thinking about myself," said Andrew.

And he was quite right. Andrew, left to himself and his purely selfish interests, could have
struck with the foremost. He would never have considered himself when it came to a question
of a conscientious struggle against injustice, though he was so prone to look upon both sides
of an argument that his decision would have been necessarily slow; but here was Ellen to consider,
and she was more than himself. While he had been, in the depths of his heart, fiercely jealous
of Robert Lloyd, yet the suspicion that his girl might suffer because of her renunciation of
him hurt him to the quick. Ellen had told him all she had done in the interests of the strike,
and he had no doubt that her action would effectually put an end to all possible relations
between the two. He tried to imagine how a girl would feel, and being a man, and measuring
all passion by the strength of his own, he exaggerated her suffering. He could eat nothing,
and looked haggard. He remained out-of-doors the greater part of the day. After he had cleared
his own paths, he secured a job clearing some for a more prosperous neighbor. Andrew in those
days grasped eagerly at any little job which could bring him in a few pennies. He worked until
dark, and when he went home he saw with a great throb of excitement the Lloyd sleigh waiting
before his door.

Robert had heard from Dennison of Ellen's attitude about the strike. He had been incredulous
at first, as indeed he had been incredulous about the strike. He had looked out of the office
window with the gaze of one who does not believe what he sees when he had heard that retreating
tramp of the workmen on the stairs.

"What does all this mean?" he said to Dennison, who entered, pale to his lips.

"It means a strike," replied Dennison. Nellie Stone rolled her pretty eyes around at the two
men from under her fluff of blond hair. Flynn came in and stood in a curious, non-committal
attitude.

"A strike!" repeated Robert, vaguely. "What for?"

It seemed incredible that he should ask, but he did. The calm masterfulness of his uncle, which
could not even imagine opposition, had apparently descended upon him.

Both foremen stared at him. Nellie Stone smiled a little covertly.

"Why, you know you had a committee wait upon you last night, Mr. Lloyd," replied Dennison.

Flynn looked out of the window at the retreating throngs of workmen, and gave a whistle under
his breath.

"Have they struck because of the wage-cutting?" asked Robert, in a curious, boyish, incredulous,
aggrieved tone. Then all at once he colored violently. "Let them strike, then!" he cried. He
threw himself into a chair and took up the morning paper, with its glaring headlines about
the unprecedented storm, as if nothing had happened. Nellie Stone, after a sly wink at Flynn,
which he did not return, began writing again. Flynn went out, and Dennison remained standing
in a rather helpless attitude. A strike in Lloyd's was unprecedented, but this manner of receiving
the news was more unprecedented still. The proprietor was apparently reading the morning paper
with much interest, when two more foremen, heads of other departments, came hurrying in.

"I have heard already," said Robert, in response to their gasped information. Then he turned
another page of the paper.

"What's to be done, sir?" said one of the new-comers, after a prolonged stare at his companion
and Dennison. He was a spare man, with a fierce glimmer of blue eyes under bent brows.

"Let them strike if they want to," replied Robert.

It was in his mind to explain at length to these men his reasons for cutting the wages--for
his own attitude as he knew it himself was entirely reasonable--but the pride of a proud family
was up in him.

"The strike would never have been on, for the men went to work quietly enough, if it hadn't
been for that Brewster girl," Dennison said, presently, but rather doubtfully. He was not quite
sure how the information would be received.

Robert dropped his paper, and stared at him with angry incredulity.

"What are you talking about?" he said. "What had Miss Brewster to do with it?"

He said "Miss Brewster" with a meaning emphasis of respect, and Dennison was quick to adopt
the hint.

"Oh, nothing," he replied, uneasily, "only she talked with them."

"You mean that Miss Brewster talked to the men?"

"Yes; she said a good deal yesterday, and to-day the men would not have struck if it had not
been for her. It only needs a spark to set them off sometimes."

Robert was very pale. "Well," he said, coolly, "there is no need for you to remain longer,
since the factory is shut down. You may as well go."

"The engineer is seeing to the fires, Mr. Lloyd," said Dennison.

"Very well."  Robert turned to the girl at the desk. "The factory is closed, Miss Stone," he
said; "there is no need for you to remain longer to-day. Come to-morrow at ten o'clock, and
I will have something for you to do with regard to settling up accounts. There is nothing in
shape now."

That afternoon Robert went to see Ellen. He could not wait until evening.

Fanny greeted him at the door, and there was the inevitable flurry about lighting the parlor
stove, and presently Ellen entered.

She had changed the gown which she had worn at her factory-work for her last winter's best
one. Her young face was pale, almost severe, and she met him in a way which made her seem a
stranger.

Robert realized suddenly that she had, as it were, closed the door upon all their old relations.
She seemed years older, and at the same time indefinably younger, since she was letting the
childish impulses, which are at the heart of all of us untouched by time and experience, rise
rampant and unchecked. She was following the lead of her own convictions with the terrible
unswerving of a child, even in the face of her own hurt. She was, metaphorically, bumping her
own head against the floor in her vain struggles for mastery over the mighty conditions of
her life.

She bowed to Robert, and did not seem to see his proffered hand.

"Won't you shake hands with me?" he asked, almost humbly, although his own wrath was beginning
to rise.

"No, I would rather not," she replied, with a straight look at him. Her blue eyes did not falter
in the least.

"May I sit down?" he said. "I have something I would like to say to you."

"Certainly, if you wish," she replied. Then she seated herself on the sofa, with Robert opposite
in the crushed-plush easy-chair.

The room was still very cold, and the breath could be seen at the lips of each in white clouds.
Robert had on his coat, but Ellen had nothing over her blue gown. It was on Robert's tongue
to ask if she were not cold, then he refrained. The issues at stake seemed to make the question
frivolous to offensiveness. He felt that any approach to tenderness when Ellen was in her present
mood would invoke an indignation for which he could scarcely blame her, that he must try to
meet her on equal fighting-ground.

Ellen sat before him, her little, cold hands tightly folded in her lap, her mouth set hard,
her steady fire of blue eyes on his face, waiting for him to speak.

Robert felt a decided awkwardness about beginning to talk. Suddenly it occurred to him to wonder
what there was to say. It amounted to this: they were in their two different positions, their
two points of view--would either leave for any argument of the other? Then he wondered if he
could, in the face of a girl who wore an expression like that, stoop to make an argument, for
the utter blindness and deafness of her very soul to any explanation of his position was too
evident in her face.

"I called to tell you, if you will permit me, how much I regret the unfortunate state of affairs
at the factory," Robert said, and the girl's eyes met his as with a flash of flame.

"Why did you not prevent it, then?" asked she. Ellen had all the fire of her family, but a
steadiness of manner which never deserted her. She was never violent.

"I could not prevent it," replied Robert, in a low voice.

Ellen said nothing.

"You mistake my position," said Robert. It was in his mind then to lay the matter fully before
her, as he had disdained to do before the committee, but her next words deterred him.

"I understand your position very fully," said she.

Robert bowed.

"There is only one way of looking at it," said Ellen, in her inexpressibly sweet, almost fanatical
voice. She tossed her head, and the fluff of fair hair over her temples caught a beam of afternoon
sunlight.

"She is only a child," thought Robert, looking at her. He rose and crossed over to the sofa,
and sat down beside her with a masterful impatience. "Look here, Ellen," he said, leaving all
general issues for their own personal ones, "you are not going to let this come between us?"

Ellen sat stiff and straight, and made no reply.

"All this can make very little difference to you," Robert urged. "You know how I feel. That
is, it can make very little difference to you if you still feel as you did. You must know that
I have only been waiting--that I am eager and impatient to lift you out of it all."

Ellen faced him. "Do you think I would be lifted out of it now?" she said.

"Why, but, Ellen, you cannot--"

"Yes, I can. You do not know me."

"Ellen, you are under a total misapprehension of my position."

"No, I am not. I apprehend it perfectly."

"Ellen, you cannot let this separate us."

Ellen looked straight ahead in silence.

"You at least owe it to me to tell me if, irrespective of this, your feelings have changed,"
Robert said, in a low voice.

Ellen said nothing.

"You may have come to prefer some one else," said Robert.

"I prefer no one before my own, before all these poor people who are a part of my life," Ellen
cried out, suddenly, her face flaming.

"Then why do you refuse to let me act for their final good? You must know what it means to
have them thrown out of work in midwinter. You know the factory will remain closed for the
present on account of the strike."

"I did not doubt it," said Ellen, in a hard voice. All the bitter thoughts to which she would
not give utterance were in her voice.

"I cannot continue to run the factory at the present rate and meet expenses," said Robert;
"in fact, I have been steadily losing for the last month."  He had, after all, descended to
explanation. "It amounts to my either reducing the wage-list or closing the factory altogether,"
he continued. "For my own good I ought to close the factory altogether, but I thought I would
give the men a chance."

Robert thought by saying that he must have finally settled matters. It did not enter his head
that she would really think it advisable for him to continue losing money. The pure childishness
of her attitude was something really beyond the comprehension of a man of business who had
come into hard business theories along with his uncle's dollars.

"What if you do lose money?" said Ellen.

Robert stared at her. "I beg your pardon?" said he.

"What if you do lose money?"

"A man cannot conduct business on such principles," replied Robert. "There would soon be no
business to conduct. You don't understand."

"Yes, I do understand fully," replied Ellen.

Robert looked at her, at the clear, rosy curve of her young cheek, the toss of yellow hair
above a forehead as candid as a baby's, at her little, delicate figure, and all at once such
a rage of masculine insistence over all this obstinacy of reasoning was upon him that it was
all he could do to keep himself from seizing her in his arms and forcing her to a view of his
own horizon. He felt himself drawn up in opposition to an opponent at once too delicate, too
unreasoning, and too beloved to encounter. It seemed as if the absurdity of it would drive
him mad, and yet he was held to it. He tried to give a desperate wrench aside from the main
point of the situation. He leaned over Ellen, so closely that his lips touched her hair.

"Ellen, let us leave all this," he pleaded; "let me talk to you. I had to wait a little while.
I knew you would understand that, but let me talk to you now."

Ellen sat as rigid as marble. "I wish to talk of nothing besides the matter at hand, Mr. Lloyd,"
said she. "That is too close to my heart for any personal consideration to come between."

Chapter LIV

When Robert went home in the winter twilight he was more miserable than he had ever been in
his life. He felt as if he had been assaulting a beautiful alabaster wall of unreason. He felt
as if that which he could shatter at a blow had yet held him in defiance. The idea of this
girl, of whom he had thought as his future wife, deliberately setting herself against him,
galled him inexpressibly, and in spite of himself he could not quite free his mind of jealousy.
On his way home he stopped at Lyman Risley's office, and found, to his great satisfaction,
that he was alone, writing at his desk. Even his stenographer had gone home. He turned around
when Robert entered, and looked at him with his quizzical, yet kindly, smile.

"Well, how are you, boy?" he said.

Robert dropped into the first chair, and sat therein, haunched up as in a lapse of despair
and weariness.

"What is the matter?" asked Risley.

"You have heard about the trouble in the factory?"

For answer Risley held up a night's paper with glaring head-lines.

"Yes, of course it is in the papers," assented Robert, wearily.

Risley stared at him in a lazily puzzled fashion. "Well," he said, "what is it all about? Why
are you so broken up about it?"  Risley laid considerable emphasis on the you.

"Yes," cried Robert, in a sudden stress of indignation. "You look at it like all the rest.
Why are all the laborers to be petted and coddled, and the capitalists held up to execration?
Good Lord, isn't there any pity for the rich man without his drop of water, in the Bible or
out? Are all creation born with blinders on, and can they only see before their noses?"

"What are you talking about, Robert?" said Risley, laughing a little.

"I say why should all the sympathy go to the workmen who are acting like the pig-headed idiots
they are, and none for the head of the factory, who has the sharp-edged, red-hot brunt of it
all to bear?"

"You wouldn't look at it that way if you were one of the poor men just out on strike such weather
as this," said Risley, dryly. He glanced as he spoke at the window, which was beginning to
be thickly furred with frost in spite of the heat of the office. Robert followed his gaze,
and noted the spreading fairy jungle of crystalline trees and flowers on the broad field of glass.

"Do you think that is the worst thing in the world to bear?" he demanded, angrily.

"What? Cold and hunger not only for yourself, but for those you love?"

"Yes."

"Well, I think it is pretty bad," replied Risley.

"Well, suppose you had to bear that, at least for those you loved, and--and--" said the young
man, lamely.

Risley remained silent, waiting.

"If I had been my uncle instead of myself I should simply have shut down with no ado," said
Robert, presently, in an angry, argumentative voice.

"I suppose you would; and as it was?"

"As it was, I thought I would give them a chance. Good God, Risley, I have been running the
factory at a loss for a month as it is. With this new wage-list I should no more than make
expenses, if I did that. What was it to me? I did it to keep them in some sort of work. As
for myself, I would much rather have shut down and done with it, but I tried to keep it running
on their account, poor devils, and now I am execrated for it, and they have deliberately refused
what little I could offer."

"Did you explain all this to the committee?" asked Risley.

"Explain? No! I told them my course was founded upon strict business principles, and was as
much for their good as for mine. They understood. They know how hard the times are. Why, it
was only last week that Weeks & McLaughlin failed, and that meant a heavy loss. I didn't explain."
Then Robert hesitated and colored. "I have just explained to her," he said, with a curious
hang of his head, like a boy, "and if my explanation was met in the same fashion by the others
in the factory I might as well have addressed the north wind. They are all alike; they are
a different race. We cannot help them, and they cannot help themselves, because they are themselves."

"You mean by her, Ellen Brewster?" Risley said.

Robert nodded gloomily.

"That is all in the paper," said Risley--"what she said to the men."

Robert made an impatient move.

"If ever there was a purely normal outgrowth, a perfect flower of her birth and environments
and training, that girl is one," said Risley, with an accent of admiration.

"She is infected with the ranting idiocy of those with whom she has been brought in daily contact,"
said Robert; but even as he spoke he seemed to see the girl's dear young face, and his voice
faltered.

"Even as you may be infected with the conservatism of those with whom you are brought in contact,"
said Risley, dryly.

"What a democrat you are, Risley!" said Robert, impatiently. "I believe you would make a good
walking delegate."

Risley laughed. "I think I would myself," he said. "Wouldn't she listen to you, Robert?"

"She listened with such utter dissent that she might as well have been dumb. It is all over
between us, Risley."

"How precipitate you are, you young folks!" said the other, good-humoredly.

"How precipitate? Do you mean to say--?"

"I mean that you are forever thinking you are on the brink of nothingness, when the true horizon-line
is too far for you ever to reach in your mortal life."

"Not in this case," said Robert.

"You know nothing about it. But if you will excuse me, it seems to me that the matter of all
these people being reduced to starvation in a howling winter is of more importance than the
coming together of two people in the bonds of wedlock. It is the aggregate against the individual."

"I don't deny that," said Robert, doggedly, "but I am not responsible for the starvation, and
the aggregate have brought it on themselves."

"You have shut down finally?"

"Yes, I have. I would rather shut down than not, as far as I am concerned. It is distinctly
for my interest. The only one objection is losing experienced workmen, but in a community like
this, and in times like this, that objection is reduced to a minimum. I can hire all I want
in the spring if I wish to open again. I should run a risk of losing on every order I should
have to fill in the next three months, even with the reduced list. I would rather shut down
than not; I only reduced the wages for them."

Robert rose as he spoke. He felt in his heart that he had gotten scant sympathy and comfort.
The older man looked with pity at the young fellow's handsome, gloomy face.

"There's one thing to remember," he said.

"What?"

"All the troubles of this world are born with wings."  Risley laughed, as he spoke, in his
half-cynical fashion.

As Robert walked home--for there was no car due--he felt completely desolate. It seemed to
him that everybody was in league against him. When he reached his uncle's splendid house and
entered, he felt such an isolation from his kind in the midst of his wealth that something
like an actual terror of solitude came over him.

The impecunious cousin of his aunt's who had come to her during her last illness acted as his
housekeeper. There was something inexpressibly irritating about this woman, who had suffered
so much, and was now nestling, with a sense of triumph over the passing of her griefs, in a
luxurious home.

She asked Robert if it were true that the factory was closed, and he felt that she noted his
gloomy face, and realized a greater extent of comfort from her own exemption from such questions.

"Business must be a great care," said she, and a look of utter peaceful reflection upon her
own lot overspread her face.

After supper Robert went down to his aunt Cynthia's. He had not been there for a long time.
The minute he entered she started up with an eagerness which had been completely foreign to
her of late years.

"What is the matter, Robert?" she asked, softly. She took both his hands as she spoke, and
her look in his face was full of delicate caressing.

Robert succumbed at once to this feminine solicitude, of which he had had lately so little.
He felt as if he had relapsed into childhood. A sense of injury which was exquisite, as it
brought along with it a sense of his demand upon love and sympathy, seized him.

"I am worried beyond endurance, Aunt Cynthia," said he.

"About the strike? I have read the night papers."

"Yes; I tried to do what was right, even at a sacrifice to myself, and--"

Cynthia had read about Ellen, but she was a woman, and she said nothing as to that.

"I tried to do what was right," Robert said, fairly broken down again.

Cynthia had seated herself, and Robert had taken a low foot-stool at her side. It came over
him as he did so that it had been a favorite seat of his when a child. As for Cynthia, influenced
by the appealing to the vulnerable place of her nature, she put her slim hands on her nephew's
head, and actually seemed to feel his baby curls.

"Poor boy," she whispered.

Robert put both his arms around her and hid his face on her shoulder, for love is a comforter,
in whatever guise.

Chapter LV

On the day after the strike Ellen went to McGuire's and to Briggs's, the two other factories
in Rowe, to see if she could obtain a position; but she was not successful. McGuire had discharged
some of his employés, reducing his force to its smallest possible limits, since he had fewer
orders, and was trying in that way to avert the necessity of a cut in wages, and a strike or
shut-down. McGuire's was essentially a union factory, as was Briggs's. Ellen would have found
in either case difficulty about obtaining employment, because she did not belong to the union,
if for no other reason. At Briggs's she encountered the proprietor himself in the office, and
he dismissed her with a bluff, almost brutal, peremptoriness which hurt her cruelly, although
she held up her head high as she left. Briggs turned to a foreman who was standing by before
she was well out of hearing.

"I like that!" he said. "Mrs. Briggs read about that girl in the paper last night, and the
strike wouldn't have been on at Lloyd's if it hadn't been for her. I would as soon take a lighted
match into a powder-magazine."

The foreman grinned. "She's a pretty, mild-looking thing," he said; "doesn't look as if she
could say boo to a goose."

"That's all you can tell," returned Briggs. "Deliver me from a light-complexioned woman. They're
all the very devil. Mrs. Briggs says it's the same girl that read that composition that made
such a stir at the high-school exhibition. She'd make more trouble in a factory than a dozen
ordinary girls, and just now, when everything is darned ticklish-looking."

"That's so," assented the foreman, "and all the more because she's good-looking."

"I don't know what you call good-looking," returned Briggs.

He had two daughters, built upon the same heavy lines as himself and wife, and he adored them.
Insensibly he regarded all more delicate feminine beauty as a disparagement of theirs. As Briggs
spoke, the foreman seemed to see in the air before his eyes the faces of the two Briggs girls,
large and massive, and dull of hue, the feminine counterpart of their father's.

"Well, maybe you're right," said he, evasively. "I suppose some might call her good-looking."

As he spoke he glanced out of the window at Ellen's retreating figure, moving away over the
snow-path with an almost dancing motion of youth and courage, though she was sorely hurt. The
girl had scarcely ever had a hard word said to her in her whole life, for she had been in her
humble place a petted darling. She had plenty of courage to bear the hard words now, but they
cut deeply into her unseasoned heart.

Ellen went on past the factories to the main street of Rowe. She had no idea of giving up her
efforts to obtain employment. She said to herself that she must have work. She thought of the
stores, that possibly she might obtain a chance to serve as a sales-girl in one of them. She
actually began at the end of the long street, and worked her way through it, with her useless
inquiries, facing proprietors and superintendents, but with no success. There was not a vacancy
in more than one or two, and there they wished only experienced hands. She found out that her
factory record told against her. The moment she admitted that she had worked in a factory the
cold shoulder was turned. The position of a shop-girl was so far below that of a sales-lady
that the effect upon the superintendent was almost as if he had met an unworthy aspirant to
a throne. He would smile insultingly and incredulously, even as he regarded her.

"You would find that our goods are too fine to handle after leather. Have you tried all the shops?"

At last Ellen gave that up, and started homeward. She paused once as she came opposite an intelligence
office. There was one course yet open to her, but from that she shrank, not on her own account,
but she dared not--knowing what would be the sufferings of her relatives should she do so--apply
for a position as a servant.

As for herself, strained as she was to her height of youthful enthusiasm for a great cause,
as she judged it to be, clamping her feet to the topmost round of her ladder of difficulty,
she would have essayed any honest labor with no hesitation whatever. But she thought of her
father and mother and grandmother, and went on past the intelligence office.

When she came to her old school-teacher's--Miss Mitchell's--house, she paused and hesitated
a moment, then she went up the little path between the snow-banks to the front door, and rang
the bell. The door was opened before the echoes had died away. Miss Mitchell had seen her coming,
and hastened to open it. Miss Mitchell had not been teaching school for some years, having
retired on a small competency of her savings. Her mortgage was paid, and there was enough for
herself and her mother to live upon, with infinite care as to details of expenditure. Every
postage-stamp and car-fare had its important part in the school-teacher's system of economy;
but she was quite happy, and her large face wore an expression of perfect peace and placidity.

She was a woman who was not tortured by any strong, ungratified desires. Her allotment of the
gifts of the gods quite satisfied her.

When Ellen entered the rather stuffy sitting-room--for Miss Mitchell and her mother were jealous
of any breath of cold air after the scanty fire was kindled--it was like entering into a stratum
of peace. It seemed quite removed from the turmoil of her own life. The school-teacher's old
mother sat in her rocker close to the stove, stouter than ever, filling up her chair with those
wandering curves and vague outlines which only the over-fleshy human form can assume. She looked
as indefinite as a quivering jelly until one reached her face. That wore a fixedness of amiability
which accentuated the whole like a high light. She had not seen Ellen for a long time, and
she greeted her with delight.

"Bless your heart!" said she, in her sweet, throaty, husky voice. "Go and get her some of them
cookies, Fanny, do."  The old woman's faculties were not in the least impaired, although she
was very old, neither had her hands lost their cunning, for she still retained her skill in
cookery, and prepared the simple meals for herself and daughter, seated in a high chair at
the kitchen table to roll out pastry or the famous little cookies which Ellen remembered along
with her childhood.

There was something about these cookies which Miss Mitchell presently brought to her in a pretty
china plate, with a little, fine-fringed napkin, which was like a morsel of solace to the girl.
With the first sweet crumble of the cake on her plate, she wished to cry. Sometimes the rush
of old, kindly, tender associations will overcome one who is quite equal to the strain of present
emergency. But she did not cry; she ate her cookies, and confided to Miss Mitchell and her
mother her desire to obtain a position elsewhere, since her factory-work had failed her. It
had occurred to her that possibly Miss Mitchell, who was on the school-board, might know of
a vacancy in a primary school for the coming spring term, and that she might obtain it.

"I think I know enough to teach a primary school," Ellen said.

"Of course you do, bless your heart," said old Mrs. Mitchell. "She knows enough to teach any
kind of a school, don't she, Fanny? You get her a school, dear, right away."

But Miss Mitchell knew of no probable vacancy, since one young woman who had expected to be
married had postponed her marriage on account of the strike in Lloyd's, and the consequent
throwing out of employment of her sweetheart. Then, also, Miss Mitchell owned with hesitation,
in response to Ellen's insistent question, that she supposed that the fact that she had worked
in a shop might in any case interfere with her obtaining a position in a school.

"There is no sense in it, dear child, I know," she said, "but it might be so."

"Yes, I supposed so," replied Ellen, bitterly. "They would all say that a shop-girl had no
right to try to teach school. Well, I'm much obliged to you, Miss Mitchell."

"What are you going to do?" Miss Mitchell asked, anxiously, following her to the door.

"I'm going to Mrs. Doty, to get some of the wrappers that mother works on, until something
else turns up," replied Ellen.

"It seems a pity."

Ellen smiled bravely. "Beggars mustn't be choosers," she said. "If we can only keep along,
somehow, I don't care."

There came a vehement pound of a stick on the floor, for that was the way the old woman in
the sitting-room commanded attention. Miss Mitchell opened the door on a crack, that she might
not let in the cold air.

"What is it, mother?" she said.

"You get Ellen a school right away, Fanny."

"All right, mother; I'll do my best."

"Get her the grammar-school you used to have."

"All right, mother."

There was something about the imperative solicitude of the old woman which comforted Ellen
in spite of its futility as she went on her way. The good-will of another human soul, even
when it cannot be resolved into active benefits, has undoubtedly a mighty force of its own.
Ellen, with the sweet of the cookies still lingering on her tongue, and the sweet of the old
woman's kindness in her soul, felt refreshed as if by some subtle spiritual cake and wine.
She even went to the door of Mrs. Doty's house. Mrs. Doty was the woman who let out wrappers
to her impecunious neighbors with an undaunted heart. She had no difficulty there. The demand
for cheap wrappers was not on the wane, even in the hard times. When Ellen reached her grandmother's
house, with a great parcel under her arm, Mrs. Zelotes opened her side door.

"What have you got there, Ellen Brewster?" she called out sharply.

"Some wrappers," replied Ellen, cheerfully.

"Are you going to work on wrappers?"

"Yes, grandma."

The door was shut with a loud report.

When Ellen entered the house and the sitting-room, her mother looked up from a pink wrapper
which she was finishing.

"What have you got there?" she demanded.

"Some wrappers."

"Why, I haven't finished the last lot."

"These are for me to make, mother."

Andrew got up and went out of the room. Fanny shut her mouth hard, and drew her thread through
with a jerk.

"Well," she said, in a second, "take off your things, and let me show you how to start on them.
There's a little knack about it."

Chapter LVI

That was a hard winter for Rowe. Aside from the financial stress, the elements seemed to conspire
against the people who were so ill-prepared to meet their fury. It was the coldest winter which
had been known for years; coal was higher, and the poor people had less coal to burn. Storm
succeeded storm; then, when there came a warm spell, there was an epidemic of the grippe, and
doctors' bills to pay and quinine to buy--and quinine was very dear.

The Brewsters managed to keep up the interest on the house mortgage, but their living expenses
were reduced to the smallest possible amount. In those days there was no wood laid ready for
kindling in the parlor stove, since there was neither any wood to spare nor expectation of
Robert's calling. Ellen and her mother sat in the dining-room, for even the sitting-room fire
had been abolished, and they heated the dining-room whenever the weather admitted it from the
kitchen stove, and worked on the wrappers for their miserable pittance.

The repeated storms were in a way a boon to Andrew, since he got many jobs clearing paths,
and thus secured a trifle towards the daily expenses.

In those days Mrs. Zelotes watched the butcher-cart anxiously when it stopped before her son's
house, and she knew just what a tiny bit of meat was purchased, and how seldom. On the days
when the cart moved on without any consultation at the tail thereof, the old woman would buy
an extra portion, cook it, and carry some over to her son's.

Times grew harder and harder. Few of the operatives who had struck in Lloyd's succeeded in
obtaining employment elsewhere, and most of them joined the union to enable them to do so.
There was actual privation. One evening, when the strike was some six weeks old, Abby Atkins
came over in a pouring rain to see Ellen. There were a number of men in the dining-room that
night. Amos Lee and Frank Dixon were among them. It was a singular thing that Andrew, taking,
as he had done, no active part in any rebellion against authority, should have come to see
his house the headquarters for the rallies of dissension. Men seemed to come to Andrew Brewster's
for the sake of bolstering themselves up in their hard position of defiance against tremendous
odds, though he sat by and seldom said a word. As for Ellen, she and her mother on these occasions
sat out in the kitchen, sewing on the endless seams of the endless wrappers. Sometimes it seemed
to the girl as if wrappers enough were being made to clothe not only the present, but future
generations of poor women. She seemed to see whole armies of hopeless, overburdened women,
all arrayed in these slouching garments, crowding the foreground of the world.

That evening little Amabel, who had developed a painful desire to make herself useful, having
divined the altered state of the family finances, was pulling out basting-threads, with a puckered
little face bent over her work. She was a very thin child, but there was an incisive vitality
in her, and somehow Fanny and Ellen contrived to keep her prettily and comfortably clothed.

"I've got to do my duty by poor Eva's child, if I starve," Fanny often said.

When the side door opened, Ellen and her mother thought it was another man come to swell the
company in the dining-room.

"It beats all how men like to come and sit round and talk over matters; for my part, I 'ain't
got any time to talk; I've got to work," remarked Fanny.

"That's so," rejoined Ellen. She looked curiously like her mother that night, and spoke like
her. In her heart she echoed the sarcasm to the full. She despised those men for sitting hour
after hour in a store, or in the house of some congenial spirit, or standing on a street corner,
and talking--talking, she was sure, to no purpose. As for herself, she had done what she thought
right; she had, as it were, cut short the thread of her happiness of life for the sake of something
undefined and rather vague, and yet as mighty in its demands for her allegiance as God. And
it was done, and there was no use in talking about it. She had her wrappers to make. However,
she told herself, extenuatingly, "Men can't sew, so they can't work evenings. They are better
off talking here than they would be in the billiard-saloon."  Ellen, at that time of her life,
had a slight, unacknowledged feeling of superiority over men of her own class. She regarded
them very much as she regarded children, with a sort of tolerant good-will and contempt. Now,
suddenly, she raised her head and listened. "That isn't another man, it's a woman--it's Abby,"
she said to her mother.

"She wouldn't come out in all this rain," replied Fanny. As she spoke, a great, wind-driven
wash of it came over the windows.

"Yes, it is," said Ellen, and she jumped up and opened the dining-room door.

Abby had entered, as was her custom, without knocking. She had left her dripping umbrella in
the entry, and her old hat was flattened on to her head with wet, and several damp locks of
her hair straggled from under it and clung to her thin cheeks. She still held up her wet skirts
around her, as she had held them out-of-doors, but she was gesticulating violently with her
other hand. She was repeating what she had said before. Ellen had heard her indistinctly through
the door.

"Yes, I mean just what I say," she cried. "Get up and go to work, if you are men! Stop hanging
around stores and corners, and talking about the tyranny of the rich, and go to work, and make
them pay you something for it, anyhow. This has been kept up long enough. Get up and go to
work, if you don't want those belonging to you to starve."

Abby caught sight of Ellen, pale and breathless, in the door, with her mother looking over
her shoulder, and she addressed her with renewed violence. "Come here, Ellen," she said, "and
put yourself on my side. We've got to give in."

"You go away," cried little Amabel, in a shrill voice, looking around Ellen's arm; but nobody
paid any attention to her.

"I never will," returned Ellen, with a great flash, but her voice trembled.

"You've got to," said Abby. "I tell you there's no other way."

"I'll die before I give up," cried Lee, in a loud, threatening voice.

"I'm with ye," said Tom Peel.

Dixon and the young laster who sat beside him looked at each other, but said nothing. Dixon
wrinkled his forehead over his pipe.

"Then you'd better go to work quick, before some that I know of, who are enough sight better
worth saving than you are, starve," replied Abby, unshrinkingly. "If I could I would go to
Lloyd's and open it on my own account to-morrow. I believe in bravery, but nothing except fools
and swine jump over precipices."

Abby passed through the room, sprinkling rain-drops from her drenched skirts, and went into
the kitchen with Ellen. Fanny cast an angry glance at her, then a solicitous one at her dripping
garments.

"Abby Atkins, you haven't got any rubbers on," said she.

"Rubbers!" repeated Abby.

"You just slip off those wet skirts, and Amabel will fetch you down Ellen's old black petticoat
and brown dress. Amabel--"

But Abby seated herself peremptorily before the kitchen stove and extended one soaked little
foot in its shabby boot. "I'm past thinking or caring about wet skirts," said she. "Good Lord,
what do wet skirts matter? We can't make wrappers any longer. We had to sell the sewing-machine
yesterday to pay the rent or be turned out, and we haven't got a thing to eat in the house
except potatoes and a little flour. We haven't had any meat for a week. Nice fare for a man
like poor father and a girl like Maria! We have come down to the kitchen fire like you, but
we can't keep it burning as late as this. The rest went to bed an hour ago to keep warm. Maria
has got more cold. She did seem better one spell, but now she's worse again. Our chamber is
freezing cold, and we haven't had a fire in it since the strike. John Sargent has ransacked
every town within twenty miles for work, but he can't get any, and his sick sister keeps sending
to him for money. He looks as if he was just about done, too. He went off somewhere after supper.
A great supper! He don't smoke a pipe nowadays. Father don't get the medicine he ought to have,
and that cold spell he just about perished for a little whiskey. The bedroom was like ice with
no fire in the sitting-room, and he didn't sleep warm. It's one awful thing after another happening.
Did you know Mamie Brady took laudanum last night?"

"Good land!" said Fanny.

"Yes, she did. Ed Flynn has been playing fast and loose with her for a long time, and she's
none too well balanced, and when it came to her not having enough to eat, and to keep her warm,
and her mother nagging at her all the time--you know what an awful hard woman her mother is--she
got desperate. She gulped it down when the last car went past and Ed Flynn hadn't come; she
had been watchin' out for him; then she told her mother, and her mother shook her, then run
for Dr. Fox, and he called in Dr. Lord, and they worked with a stomach-pump till morning, and
she isn't out of danger yet. Then that isn't all. Willy Jones's mother is failing. He was over
to our house last evening, telling us about it, and he fairly cried, poor boy. He said he actually
could not get her what she needed to make her comfortable this awful winter. It was all he
could do with odd jobs to keep the roof over their heads, that she hadn't actually enough to
eat and keep her warm. It seemed as if he would die when he told about it. And that isn't all.
Those little Blake children next door are fairly starving. They are going around to the neighbors'
swill-buckets--it's a fact--just like little hungry dogs, and it's precious little they find
in them. Mrs. Wetherhed has let her sewing-machine go, and Edward Morse is going to be sold
out for taxes. And that isn't all."  Abby lowered her voice a little. She cast an apprehensive
glance at the door of the other room, and at Amabel. "Mamie Bemis has gone to the bad. I had
it straight. She's in Boston. She didn't have enough to pay for her board, and got desperate.
I know her sister did wrong, but that was no reason why she should have, and I don't believe
she would if it hadn't been for the strike. It's all on account of the strike. There's no use
talking: before the sparrow flies in the eyes of the tiger, he'd better count the cost."

Fanny, quite white, stood staring from Abby to Ellen, and back again.

Amabel was holding fast to a fold of Ellen's skirt. Ellen looked rigid.

"I knew it all before," she said, in a low voice.

Suddenly Abby jumped up and caught the other girl in a fierce embrace. "Ellen," she sobbed--"Ellen,
isn't there any way out of it? I can't see--"

Ellen freed herself from Abby with a curious imperative yet gentle motion, then she opened
the door into the other room again. The loud clash of voices hushed, and every man faced towards
her standing on the threshold, with her mother and Abby and little Amabel in the background.
"I want to say to you all," said Ellen, in a clear voice, "that I think I did wrong. I have
been wondering if I had not for some time, and growing more and more certain. I did not count
the cost. All I thought of was the principle, but the cost is a part of the principle in this
world, and it has to be counted in with it. I see now. I don't think the strike ought ever
to have been. It has brought about too much suffering upon those who were not responsible for
it, who did not choose it of their own free will. There are children starving, and people dying
and breaking their hearts. We have brought too much upon ourselves and others. I am sorry I
said what I did in the shop that day, if I influenced any one. Now I am not going to strike
any longer. Let us all accept Mr. Lloyd's terms, and go back to work."

But Ellen's voice was drowned out in a great shout of wrath and dissent from Lee. He directly
leaped to the conclusion that the girl took this attitude on account of Lloyd, and his jealousy,
which was always smouldering, flamed.

"Well, I guess not!" he shouted. "I rather guess not! I've struck, and I'm going to stay struck!
I ain't goin' to back out because a girl likes the boss, damn him!"

Andrew and the young laster rose and moved quietly before Ellen. Tom Peel said nothing, but
he grinned imperturbably.

"I 'ain't had a bit of tobacco, and the less said about what I've had to eat the better," Lee
went on, in a loud, threatening voice, "but I ain't going to give up. No, miss; you've het
up the fightin' blood in me, and it ain't so easy coolin' of it down."

The door opened, and Granville Joy entered. He had knocked several times, but nobody had heard
him. He looked inquiringly from one to another, then moved beside Andrew and the laster.

Dixon got up. "It looks to me as if it was too soon to be giving up now," he said.

"It's easy for a man who's got nobody dependent upon him to talk," cried Abby.

"I won't give up!" cried Dixon, looking straight at Ellen, and ignoring Abby.

"That's so," said Lee. "We don't give up our rights for bosses, or bosses' misses."

As he said that there was a concerted movement of Andrew, the laster, and Granville. Granville
was much slighter than Lee, but suddenly his right arm shot out, and the other man went down
like a log. Andrew followed him up with a kick.

"Get out of my house," he shouted, "and never set foot in it again! Out with ye!"

Lee was easily cowed. He did not attempt to make any resistance, but gathered himself up, muttering,
and moved before the three into the entry, where he had left his coat and hat. Dixon and Peel
followed him. When the door was shut, Ellen turned to the others, with a quieting hand on Amabel's
head, who was clinging to her, trembling.

"I think it will be best to talk to John Sargent," said she. "I think a committee had better
be appointed to wait upon Mr. Lloyd again, and ask him to open the factory. I'm not going to
strike any longer."

"I'm sure I'm not," said Abby.

"Abby and I are not going to strike any longer," said Ellen, in an indescribably childlike
way, which yet carried enormous weight with it.

Chapter LVII

Ellen had not arrived at her decision with regard to the strike as
suddenly as it may have seemed. All winter, ever since the strike,
Ellen had been wondering, not whether the principle of the matter
was correct or not, that she never doubted; she never swerved in her
belief concerning the cruel tyranny of the rich and the helpless
suffering of the poor, and their good reason for making a stand, but
she doubted more and more the wisdom of it. She used to sit for
hours up in her chamber after her father and mother had gone to bed,
wrapped up in an old shawl against the cold, resting her elbows on
the window-sill and her chin on her two hands, staring out into the
night, and reflecting. Her youthful enthusiasm carried her like a
leaping-pole to conclusions beyond her years. "I wonder," she said
to herself, "if, after all, this inequality of possessions is not a
part of the system of creation, if the righting of them is not
beyond the flaming sword of the Garden of Eden? I wonder if the one
who tries to right them forcibly is not meddling, and usurping the
part of the Creator, and bringing down wrath and confusion not only
upon his own head, but upon the heads of others? I wonder if it is
wise, in order to establish a principle, to make those who have no
voice in the matter suffer for it--the helpless women and children?"
 She even thought with a sort of scornful sympathy of Sadie Peel,
who could not have her nearseal cape, and had not wished to strike.
She reflected, as she had done so many times before, that the world
was very old--thousands of years old--and inequality was as old as
the world. Might it not even be a condition of its existence, the
shifting of weights which kept it to its path in the scheme of the
universe? And yet always she went back to her firm belief that the
strikers were right, and always, although she loved Robert Lloyd,
she denounced him. Even when it came to her abandoning her position
with regard to the strike, she had not the slightest thought of
effecting thereby a reconciliation with Robert.

For the first time, that night when she had gone to bed, after announcing her determination
to go back to work, she questioned her affection for Robert. Before she had always admitted
it to herself with a sort of shamed and angry dignity. "Other women feel so about men, and
why should I not?" she had said; "and I shall never fail to keep the feeling behind more important
things."  She had accepted the fact of it with childlike straightforwardness as she accepted
all other facts of life, and now she wondered if she really did care for him so much. She thought
over and over everything Abby had said, and saw plainly before her mental vision those poor
women parting with their cherished possessions, the little starving children snatching at the
refuse-buckets at the neighbors' back doors. She saw with incredulous shame, and something
between pity and scorn, Mamie Bemis, who had gone wrong, and Mamie Brady, who had taken her
foolish, ill-balanced life in her own hands. She remembered every word which she had said to
the men on the morning of the strike, and how they had started up and left their machines.
"I did it all," she told herself. "I am responsible for it all--all this suffering, for those
hungry little children, for that possible death, for the ruin of another girl."  Then she told
herself, with a stern sense of justice, that back of her responsibility came Robert Lloyd's.
If he had not cut the wages it would never have been. It seemed to her that she almost hated
him, and that she could not wait to strive to undo the harm which she had done. She could not
wait for morning to come.

She lay awake all night in a fever of impatience. When she went down-stairs her eyes were brilliant,
there were red spots on her cheeks, her lips were tense, her whole face looked as if she were
strained for some leap of action. She took hold of everything she touched with a hard grip.
Her father and mother kept watching her anxiously. Directly after breakfast Ellen put on her
hat and coat.

"What are you going to do?" asked Fanny.

"I am going over to see John Sargent, and ask him to get some other men and go to see Mr. Lloyd,
and tell him we are willing to go to work again," replied Ellen.

Ellen discovered, when she reached the Atkins house, that John Sargent had already resolved
upon his course of action.

"The first thing he said when he came in last night was that he couldn't stand it any longer,
and he was going to see the others, and go to Lloyd, and ask him to open the shop on his own
terms," said Abby. "I told him how we felt about it."

"Yes, I am ready to go back whenever the factory is opened," said Ellen. "I am glad he has gone."

Ellen did not remain long. She was anxious to return and finish some wrappers she had on hand.
Abby promised to go over and let her know the result of the interview with Lloyd.

It was not until evening that Abby came over, and John Sargent with her. Lloyd had not been
at home in the morning, and they had been forced to wait until late afternoon. The two entered
the dining-room, where Ellen and her mother sat at work.

Abby spoke at once, and to the point. "Well," said she, "the shop's going to be opened to-morrow."

"On what terms?" asked Ellen.

"On the boss's, of course," replied Abby, in a hard voice.

"It's the only thing to do," said Sargent, with a sort of stolid assertion. "If we are willing
to be crushed under the Juggernaut of principle, we haven't any right to force others under,
and that's what we are doing."

"Bread without butter is better than no bread at all," said Abby.
"We've got to live in the sphere in which Providence has placed us."
 The girl said "Providence" with a sarcastic emphasis.

Andrew was looking at Sargent. "Do you think there will be any trouble?" he asked.

Sargent hesitated, with a glance at Fanny. "I don't know; I hope not," said he. "Lee and Dixon
are opposed to giving in, and they are talking hard to-night in the store. Then some of the
men have joined the union since the strike, and of course they swear by it, because it has
been helping them, and they won't approve of giving up. But I doubt if there will be much trouble.
I guess the majority want to go to work, even the union men. The amount of it is, it has been
such a tough winter it has taken the spirit out of the poor souls." Sargent, evidently, in
yielding was resisting himself.

"You don't think there will be any danger?" Fanny said, anxiously, looking at Ellen.

"Oh no, there's no danger for the girls, anyhow. I guess there's enough men to look out for
them. There's no need for you to worry, Mrs. Brewster."

"Mr. Lloyd did not offer to do anything better about the wages?" asked Ellen.

Sargent shook his head.

"Catch him!" said Abby, bitterly.

Ellen had a feeling as if she were smiting in the face that image of Robert which always dwelt
in her heart.

"Well," said Abby, with a mirthless laugh, "there's one thing: according to the Scriptures,
it is as hard for the rich man to get into heaven as it is for the poor men to get into their
factories."

"You don't suppose there will be any danger?" Fanny said again, anxiously.

"Danger--no; who's afraid of Amos Lee and a few like him?" cried Abby, contemptuously; "and
Nahum Beals is safe. He's going to be tried next month, they say, but they'll make it imprisonment
for life, because they think he wasn't in his right mind. If he was here we might be afraid,
but there's nobody now that will do anything but talk. I ain't afraid. I'm going to march up
to the shop to-morrow morning and go to work, and I'd like to see anybody stop me."

However, before they left, John Sargent spoke aside with Andrew, and told him of a plan for
the returning workmen to meet at the corner of a certain street, and go in a body to the factory,
and suggested that there might be pickets posted by the union men, and Andrew resolved to go
with Ellen.

The next morning the rain had quite ceased, and there was a faint something, rather a reminiscence
than a suggestion, of early spring in the air. People caught themselves looking hard at the
elm branches to see if they were acquiring the virile fringe of spring or if their eyes deceived
them, and wondered, with respect to the tips of maple and horse-chestnut branches, whether
or not they were swollen red and glossy. Sometimes they sniffed incredulously when a soft gust
of south wind seemed laden with fresh blossom fragrance.

"I declare, if I didn't know better, I should think I smelled apple blossoms," said Maria.

"Stuff!" returned Abby. She was marching along with an alert, springy motion of her lean little
body. She was keenly alive to the situation, and scented something besides apple blossoms.
She had tried to induce Maria to remain at home. "I don't know but there'll be trouble, and
if there is, you'll be just in the way," she told her before they left the house, but not in
their parents' hearing.

"Oh, I don't believe there'll be any. Folks will be too glad to get back to work," replied
Maria. She had a vein of obstinacy, gentle as she was; then, too, she had a reason which no
one suspected for wishing to be present. She would not yield when John Sargent begged her privately
not to go. It was just because she was afraid there might be trouble, and he was going to be
in it, that she could not bear to stay at home herself.

Andrew had insisted upon accompanying Ellen in spite of her remonstrances. "I've got an errand
down to the store," he said, evasively; but Ellen understood.

"I don't think there is any danger, and there wouldn't be any danger for me--not for the girls,
sure," she said; but he persisted.

"Don't you say a word to your mother to scare her," he whispered. But they had not been gone
long before Fanny followed them, Mrs. Zelotes watching her furtively from a window as she went by.

All the returning employés met, as agreed upon, at the corner of a certain street, and marched
in a solid body towards Lloyd's. The men insisted upon placing the girls in the centre of this
body, although some of them rebelled, notably Sadie Peel. She was on hand, laughing and defiant.

"I guess I ain't afraid," she proclaimed. "Father's keepin' on strikin', but I guess he won't
see his own daughter hurt; and now I'm goin' to have my nearseal cape, if it is late in the
season. They're cheaper now, that's one good thing. On some accounts the strike has been a
lucky thing for me."  She marched along, swinging her arms jauntily. Ellen and Maria and Abby
were close together. Andrew was on the right of Ellen, Granville Joy behind; the young laster,
who had called so frequently evenings, was with him. John Sargent and Willy Jones were on the
left. They all walked in the middle of the street like an army. It was covertly understood
that there might be trouble. Some of the younger men from time to time put hands on their pockets,
and a number carried stout sticks.

The first intimation of disturbance came when they met an electric-car, and all moved to one
side to let it pass. The car was quite full of people going to another town, some thirty miles
distant, to work in a large factory there. Nearly every man and woman on the car belonged to
the union.

As this car slid past a great yell went up from the occupants; men on the platforms swung their
arms in execration and derision. "Sc-ab, sc-ab!" they called. A young fellow leaped from the
rear platform, caught up a stone and flung it at the returning Lloyd men, but it went wide
of its mark. Then he was back on the platform with a running jump, and one of the Lloyd men
threw a stone, which missed him. The yell of "Scab, scab!" went up with renewed vigor, until
it died out of hearing along with the rumble of the car.

"Sometimes I wish I had joined the union and stuck it out," said one of the Lloyd men, gloomily.

"For the Lord's sake, don't show the white feather now!" cried a young fellow beside him, who
was striding on with an eager, even joyous outlook. He had fighting blood, and it was up, and
he took a keen delight in the situation.

"It's easy to talk," grumbled the other man. "I don't know but all our help lies in the union,
and we've been a pack of fools not to go in with them, because we hoped Lloyd would weaken
and take us back. He hasn't weakened; we've had to. Good God, them that's rich have it their
own way!"

"I'd have joined the union in a minute, and got a job, and got my nearseal cape, if it hadn't
been for father," said Sadie Peel, with a loud laugh. "But, my land! if father'd caught me
joinin' the union I dun'no' as there would have been anything left of me to wear the cape."

They all marched along with no disturbance until they reached the corner of the street into
which they had to turn in order to approach Lloyd's. There they were confronted by a line of
pickets, stationed there by the union, and the real trouble began. Yells of "Scab, scab!" filled
the air.

"Good land, I ain't no more of a scab than you be!" shrieked Sadie Peel, in a loud, angry voice.
"Scab yourself! Touch me if you dasse!"

Many young men among the returning force had stout sticks in their hands. Granville Joy was
one of them. Andrew, who was quite unarmed, pressed in before Ellen. Granville caught him by
the arm and tried to draw him back.

"Look here, Mr. Brewster," he said, "you keep in the background a little. I am young and strong,
and here are Sargent and Mendon. You'd better keep back."

But Ellen, with a spring which was effectual because so utterly uncalculated, was before Granville
and her father, and them all. She reasoned it out in a second that she was responsible for
the strike, and that she would be in the front of whatever danger there was in consequence.
Her slight little figure passed them all before they knew what she was doing. She was in the
very front of the little returning army. She saw the threatening faces of the pickets; she
half turned, and waved an arm of encouragement, like a general in a battle. "Strike if you
want to," she cried out, in her sweet young voice. "If you want to kill a girl for going back
to work to save herself and her friends from starvation, do it. I am not afraid! But kill me,
if you must kill anybody, because I am the one that started the strike. Strike if you want to."

The opposing force moved aside with an almost imperceptible motion. Ellen looked like a beautiful
child, her light hair tossed around her rosy face, her eyes full of the daring of perfect confidence.
She in reality did not feel one throb of fear. She passed the picket-line, and turned instinctively
and marched backward with her blue eyes upon them all. Abby Atkins sprang forward to Ellen's
side, with Sargent and Joy and Willy Jones and Andrew. Andrew kept calling to Ellen to come
back, but she did not heed him.

The little army was several rods from the pickets before a shot rang out, but that was fired
into the air. However, it was followed by a fierce clamor of "Scab" and a shower of stones,
which did little harm. The Lloyds marched on without a word, except from Sadie Peel. She turned
round with a derisive shout.

"Scab yourselves!" she shrieked. "You dassen't fire at me. You're scabs yourselves, you be!"

"Scabs, scabs!" shouted the men, moving forward.

"Scab yourself!" shouted Sadie Peel.

Abby Atkins caught hold of her arm and shook her violently. "Shut up, can't you, Sadie Peel,"
she said.

"I'll shut up when I get ready, Abby Atkins! I ain't afraid of them if you be. They dassen't
hit me. Scab, scab!" the girl yelled back, with a hysteric laugh.

"Don't that girl know anything?" growled a man behind her.

"Shut up, Sadie Peel," said Abby Atkins.

"I ain't afraid if you be, and I won't shut up till I get ready, for you or anybody else. I'm
goin' to have my nearseal cape! Hi!"

"I ain't afraid," said Abby, contemptuously, "but I've got sense."

Maria pressed close to Sadie Peel. "Please do keep still, Sadie," she pleaded. "Let us get
into the factory as quietly as we can. Think, if anybody was hurt."

"I ain't afraid," shrieked the girl, with a toss of her red fringe, and she laughed like a
parrot. Abby Atkins gripped her arm so fiercely that she made her cry out with pain. "If you
don't keep still!" she said, threateningly.

Willy Jones was walking as near as he could, and he carried his right arm half extended, as
if to guard her. Now and then Abby turned and gave him a push backward.

"They won't trouble us girls, and you might as well let us and the men that have sticks go
first," she said in a whisper.

"If you think--" began the young fellow, coloring.

"Oh, I know you ain't afraid," said Abby, "but you've got your mother to think of, and there's
no use in running into danger."

The pickets were gradually left behind; they were, in truth, half-hearted. Many of them had
worked in Lloyd's, and had small mind to injure their old comrades. They were not averse to
a great show of indignation and bluster, but when it came to more they hesitated.

Presently the company came into the open space before Lloyd's. Robert and Lyman Risley and
several foremen were standing at the foot of the stairs. The windows of the factory were filled
with faces, and derisive cries came from them. Lloyd's tall shaft of chimney was plumed with
smoke. The employés advanced towards the stairs, when suddenly Amos Lee, Dixon, and a dozen
others appeared, coming with a rush from around a corner of the building, and again the air
was filled with the cry of "Scab!"  Ellen and Abby linked arms and sprang forward before the
men with an impetuous rush, with Joy and Willy Jones and Andrew following. Ellen, as she rushed
on towards the factory stairs, was conscious of no fear at all, but rather of a sort of exaltation
of courage. It did not really occur to her that she could be hurt, that it could be in the
heart of Lee or Dixon, or any of them, actually to harm her. She was throbbing and intense
with indignation and resolution. Into that factory to her work she was bound to go. All that
intimidated her in the least was the fear for her father. She rushed as fast as she could that
her father might not get before her and be hurt in some way.

"Scab! scab!" shouted Lee and the others.

"Scab yourself!" shrieked Sadie Peel. Her father was one of the opposing party, and that gave
her perfect audacity. "Look out you don't hit me, dad," she cried to him. "I'm goin' to get
my nearseal cape. Don't you hit your daughter, Tom Peel!"  She raced on with a sort of hoppity-skip.
She caught a young man near her by the arm and forced him into the same dancing motion.

They were at the foot of the stairs, when Robert, watching, saw Lee with a pistol in his hand
aim straight at Ellen. He sprang before her, but Risley was nearer, and the shot struck him.
When Risley fell, a great cry, it would have been difficult to tell whether of triumph or horror,
went up from the open windows of the other factories, and men came swarming out. Lee and his
companions vanished.

A great crowd gathered around Risley until the doctors came and ordered them away, and carried
him in the ambulance to the hospital. He was not dead, but evidently very seriously injured.

When the ambulance had rolled out of sight, the Lloyd employés entered the factory, and the
hum of machinery began.

Fanny and Andrew stood together before the factory after Ellen had entered. Andrew had started
when he had seen his wife.

"You here?" he said.

"I rather guess I'm here," returned Fanny. "Do you s'pose I was goin' to stay at home, and
not know whether you and her were shot dead or not?"

"I guess it's all safe now," said Andrew. He was very pale. He looked at the blood-stained
place where Lyman Risley had lain. "It's awful work," he said.

"Who did it?" asked Fanny, sharply. "I heard the shot just before I got here."

"I don't know for sure, and guess it's better I don't," replied Andrew, sternly.

Then all at once as they stood there a woman came up with a swift, gliding motion and a long
trail of black skirts straight to Fanny, who was the only woman there. There were still a great
many men and boys standing about. The woman, Cynthia Lennox, caught Fanny's arm with a nervous
grip. Her finely cut face was very white under the nodding plumes of her black bonnet.

"Is he in there?" she asked, in a strained voice, pointing to the shop.

Fanny stared at her. She was half dazed. She did not know whether she was referring to the
wounded man or Robert.

Andrew was quicker in his perceptions.

"They carried him off to the hospital in the ambulance," he told her. Then he added, as gently
as if he had been addressing Ellen: "I guess he wasn't hurt so very bad. He came to before
they took him away."

"You don't know anything about it," Fanny said, sharply. "I heard them say something about
his eyes."

"His eyes!" gasped Cynthia. She held tightly to Fanny, who looked at her with a sudden passion
of sympathy breaking through her curiosity.

"Oh, I guess he wasn't hurt so very bad; he did come to. I heard him speak," she said, soothingly.
She laid her hard hand over Cynthia's slim one.

"They took him to the hospital?"

"Yes, in the ambulance."

"Is--my nephew in there?"

"No; he went with him."

Cynthia looked at the other woman with an expression of utter anguish and pleading.

"Look here," said Fanny; "the hospital ain't very far from here. Suppose we go up there and
ask how he is? We could call out your nephew."

"Will you go with me?" asked Cynthia, with a heart-breaking gasp.

If Ellen could have seen her at that moment, she would have recognized her as the woman whom
she had known in her childhood. She was an utter surprise to Fanny, but her sympathy leaped
to meet her need like the steel to the magnet.

"Of course I will," she said, heartily.

"I would," said Andrew--"I would go with her, Fanny."

"Of course I will," said Fanny; "and you had better go home, I guess, Andrew, and see how I
left the kitchen fire. I don't know but the dampers are all wide open."

Fanny and Cynthia hastened in one direction towards the hospital, and Andrew towards home;
but he paused for a minute, and looked thoughtfully up at the humming pile of Lloyd's. The
battle was over and the strike was ended. He drew a great sigh, and went home to see to the
kitchen fire.

Chapter LVIII

Lyman Risley was very seriously injured. There was, as the men had reported, danger for his
eyes. When Robert was called into the reception-room of the hospital to see his aunt, he scarcely
recognized her. Her soft, white hair was tossed about her temples, her cheeks were burning.
She ran up to him like an eager child and clutched his arm.

"How is he?" she demanded. "Tell me quick!"

"They are doing everything they can for him. Why, don't, poor Aunt Cynthia!"

"His eyes, they said--"

"I hope he will come out all right. Don't, dear Aunt Cynthia."  The young man put his arm around
his aunt and spoke soothingly, blushing like a girl before this sudden revelation of an under-stratum
of delicacy in a woman's heart.

Cynthia lost control of herself completely; or, rather, the true self of her rose uppermost,
shattering the surface ice of her reserve. "Oh," she said--"oh, if he--if he is--blind, if
he is--I--I--will lead him everywhere all the rest of his life; I will, Robert."

"Of course you will, dear Aunt Cynthia," replied Robert, soothingly.

Suddenly Cynthia's face took on a new expression. She looked at Robert, deadly pale, and her
jaw dropped. "He will not--die," she said, with stiff lips. "It is not as bad as that?"

"Oh no, no; I am sure he will not," Robert cried, wonderingly and pityingly. "Don't, Aunt Cynthia."

"If he dies," she said--"if he dies--and he has loved me all this time, and I have never done
anything for him--I cannot bear it; I will not bear it; I will not, Robert!"

"Oh, he isn't going to die, Aunt Cynthia."

"I want to go to him," she said. "I will go to him."

Robert looked helplessly from her to Fanny. "I am afraid you can't just now, Aunt Cynthia,"
he replied.

Fanny came resolutely to his assistance. "Of course you can't, Miss Lennox," she said. "The
doctors won't let you see him now. You would do him more harm than good. You don't want to
do him harm!"

"No, I don't want to do him harm," returned Cynthia, in a wailing, hysterical voice. She threw
herself down upon a sofa and began sobbing like a child, with her face hidden.

A young doctor entered and stood looking at her.

Robert turned to him. "It is my aunt, and she is agitated over Mr. Risley's accident," he said,
coloring a little.

Instantly the young physician's face lost its expression of astonishment and assumed the soothing
gloss of his profession. "Oh, my dear Miss Lennox," he said, "there is no cause for agitation,
I assure you. Everything is being done for Mr. Risley."

"Will he be blind?" gasped Cynthia, with a great vehemence of woe, which seemed to gainsay
the fact of her years. It seemed as if such an outburst of emotion could come only from a child
all unacquainted with grief and unable to control it.

The young doctor laughed blandly. "Blind? No, indeed," he replied. "He might have been blind
had this happened twenty-five years ago, but with the resources of the present day it is a
different matter. Pray don't alarm yourself, dear Miss Lennox."

"Can you call a carriage for my aunt?" asked Robert. He went close to Cynthia and laid a hand
on her slender shoulder. "I am going to have a carriage come for you, and perhaps Mrs. Brewster
will be willing to go home with you in it."

"Of course I will," replied Fanny.

"You hear what Dr. Payson says, that there is nothing to be alarmed about," Robert said, in
a low voice, with his lips close to his aunt's ear.

Cynthia made no resistance, but when the carriage arrived, and she was being driven off, with
Fanny by her side, she called out of the window with a fierce shamelessness of anxiety, "Robert,
you must come and tell me how he is this afternoon, or I shall come back here and see him myself."

"Yes, I will, Aunt Cynthia," he replied, soothingly. He met the doctor's curious eyes when
he turned. Every failure can be traced to poor work in the original installation or to the use
of a cheap cable, both causes being due, generally, to that false economy which looks for too
quick returns. A poorly insulated line wire and a poorly insulated cable are two very different
things.

However, it is a fact that by the use of a good cable it is not difficult to construct an underground
system for light, power, telegraph or telephone uses that will be
superior to overhead lines in its service and in cost of maintenance.

The ideal underground system must have as a starting point a system
of subways admitting of the easy drawing in and out of cables and
affording means of making subsidiary connections readily and with
the minimum of expense and interruption of service.

This is practically accomplished by a subway consisting of lines
of pipe terminating at convenient intervals, say at street intersections,
in manholes, for convenience in jointing and in running out house
connections.

These pipes, or ducts, as they are called, should be for two kinds of service; the lower or
deeper laid lines for the main or trunk circuits, and a second series of ducts laid nearer the
surface, running into service boxes placed near together for lines
to "house to house" connections.

In some cities where it is allowed to run overhead lines, the plan
of running but one service connection in a block is followed, all
customers in the block being supplied from a line run over the housetops
or strung on the rear walls.

This makes unnecessary all subsidiary ducts except a short one from the manhole to the nearest
building in the block, and effects a considerable saving in pipe,
service boxes, cables and labor.

The manholes should have their walls built up of brick, the floors should be of concrete, and
there should be an inside lid which can be fastened down and the manhole thus made water-tight.

For
ducts wood, iron or cement lined pipe may be used. To preserve the wood it is generally treated
with creosote, which, in contact with the lead cover of the cable,
sets up a chemical action, resulting in the destruction of the lead.

Wood offers but little protection for the cable, as it is too easily damaged and broken through in
the frequent street openings made by companies operating lines of pipe in the streets, and as
one of the main purposes of a subway is that of a protection to cables, wooden ducts have little
to recommend them except their cheapness.

Iron pipes are either laid in trenches filled in with earth or are
laid in cement.

Iron pipe will of course rust out in time, and if absolute permanence in construction is desired,
should be laid in cement, for after the pipe rusts out, the duct
of cement is still left.

However, if we are going to the expense of laying in cement, it would
be much preferable to use cement lined pipe, which is not only cheaper
than iron pipe, but makes the most perfect cable conduit, as it affords
a perfectly smooth surface to draw the cable over and give a good
duct edge.

It is not necessary, however, in small installations of cable, especially where additional connections
will not be of frequent occurrence, to go to the expense of subways,
for cable may be safely laid in the ground in trenches filled in with
earth, or can be inclosed in a plain wooden box or a wooden box filled
with pitch.

There are, of course, many localities where, if the cable is laid
in contact with the earth, a chemical action would take place
which might result in the destruction of the cable.

 Underground cables are of the following classes: 1. Rubber insulated
cables, insulated with rubber or other homogeneous material. 2. Fibrous
cables, so called from the conductors being covered with some fibrous
material, as cotton or paper, which is saturated with the insulating
material, paraffine, resin oil, or some special compound. Under
this latter head is also included the dry core paper cables.

The first thing to do is to get the cable drawn into the ducts, and on
the proper accomplishment of this depends to a great extent the
success or failure of the whole installation. Probably the ducts
have been wired when the subway was constructed, but if not a wire
must be run through as a means of pulling in the draw rope.

There are several kinds of apparatus for getting a wire through a duct--rods, flexible tapes,
mechanical "creepers," etc.; but probably the best is the sectional
rod.

This simply consists of three or four foot lengths of hard wood rods, having metal tips that screw
into each other. A rod is placed in a duct at a manhole, one screwed to that, both are pushed
forward, another one added and pushed forward, and so on until they extend the entire length
of the duct.

Then the wire is attached and the rods are pulled out and detached
one at a time and with the last rod the wire is through.

At least No. 14 galvanized iron or steel wire should be used, for any smaller size cannot
be used a second time, as a rule.

In starting to pull in the draw rope a wire brush should be attached
to the wire and to this again the rope, and when the brush arrives
at the distant end of the duct it very likely will bring with it a
miscellaneous collection of material which for the good of the cable
had better be in the manhole than in the duct.

The reel or drum carrying the cable should be mounted on wheels or jacks and placed on the same
side of the manhole as the duct into which the cable is to be drawn, and must always be so placed
that the cable will run off the top of the reel.

There are several methods of attaching the draw rope to the cable.

As simple and strong a method as any is to punch two of these holes through the cable, lead
and all, and attach the rope by means of an iron wire--some of the draw wire will do--run through
these holes. Depending on the length and weight of cable to be pulled it can be drawn either
by hand or by a multiplying winch. The rope should run through a block fastened in the manhole
in such a position that the rope shall have a good straightaway lead
from the mouth of the duct.

The strain on the cable should be perfectly uniform and steady; if the power is applied by a series
of jerks either the lead covering may be pulled apart or some of
the conductors broken.

At the reel there must always be a large enough number of men to
turn it and keep the cable from rubbing on anything, and in the manhole
one or more men to see that the cable feeds into the duct straight
and to guide it if necessary.

If the ducts are of iron and are not perfectly smooth at the ends, these should be made so with
a file, and in addition a protector of some sort should be placed
in the mouths of the duct, both above and below the cable.

Six inches of lead pipe, split lengthwise and bent over at one end
to prevent being drawn into the duct with the cable, makes a very
good protector.

The cable should be reeled off the drum just fast enough to prevent any of the power used in
pulling the cable through the duct being utilized in unreeling it.

If this latter is allowed to occur the cable will be bent too short
and the lead covering buckled or broken, and also the cable may be
jammed against the upper edge of the duct and perhaps cut through.

If the reel is allowed to turn faster than the cable is drawn in, the first three or four turns
on the reel will slacken up, and the lead covering may either be dented or cut through by scraping
on the ground.

If the cable end when pulled through up to the block is not long
enough to bend around the hole more than half way, the rope should
be unfastened from its end, a length of rope with a well frayed out
end should be run through the block, and by fastening to the cable
close to the duct, with a series of half hitches, as much slack as
necessary can be pulled in.

If this is properly manipulated there need not be a scratch on the cable, but unless great
care is taken the lead may be pressed up into ridges and the core
itself damaged.

Immediately after the cable is drawn in, if the joint is not to be at once made, the open end
or ends should be cut off and the cable soldered up, as most cables are very susceptible to
moisture and readily absorb water even from the atmosphere. Where practicable it is always
a good plan to pull the cable through as many manholes as possible without cutting the cable;
for the joint is, especially in telephone or telegraph cables, the weak point. To do this
the rope should be pulled through the proper duct in the next section without unfastening it from
the cable; the winch should be moved to the next manhole, and pulling through then done as before.
There should always be a man in every hole through which the cable is running to see that it
does not bind anywhere and to keep protectors around the cable.

It is not advisable to pull more than one cable into a duct, and never advisable to pull a cable
into a duct containing another cable, but if two or more cables have to go into the same duct,
they should always be drawn in together. Lead covered cables and those with no lead on the outside
should never be pulled into the same duct, for if they bind anywhere the soft cable will suffer
where two lead covered cables would get through all right. Some manufacturers are now putting
on their cables a tape or braid covering, which saves the lead many bad bruises and cuts, and
is a valuable addition to a cable at very little additional expense.

Practically all electric light and power cables are either single or double conductors, and the
jointing of these is comparatively a simple matter, although requiring considerable care. The lead
is cut back from each end about four or five inches, and the conductors bared of insulation
for two or three inches.

The bare conductors should be thoroughly tinned by dipping in the
metal pot or pouring the melted solder over them.

A sperm candle is better than resin or acid for any part of the operations
where solder is used.

A lead sleeve is here slipped back over the cable, out of the way,
and the ends of the conductors brought together in a copper sleeve
which is then sweated to a firm joint.

This part must be as good a piece of work mechanically as electrically.

The bare splice is then wrapped tightly with cotton or silk tape to
a thickness slightly greater than that of the insulation of the cable,
and is thoroughly saturated with the insulating compound until all
moisture previously absorbed by the tape is driven off.

The lead sleeve is then brought over the splice and wiped to the cable.

The joint is then filled with the insulating compound poured through holes in the top of the
sleeve; these holes are then closed and the joint is complete, and there is no reason why, in
light and power cables, that joint should not be as perfect as any other part of the cable. When
the cable ends are prepared for jointing they should be hung up in such a position that they are in the
same plane, both horizontal and vertically, and firmly secured there, so that when the lead
sleeve is wiped on the conductor may be in its exact center, and great care must be taken
not to move the cables again until the sleeve is filled and the insulation sufficiently cooled
to hold the conductor in position.

It is also very important to see that there are no sharp points on the conductors themselves, on
the copper sleeve, on the edges of the lead covering or on the lead
sleeve.

All these should be made perfectly smooth, for points facilitate
disruptive discharges.

Branch joints had better be made as T-joints rather than as Y-joints, for they are better electrically
and mechanically, although they occupy more room in the manholes. They are of course made in the
same way as straight joints, a lead T-sleeve being used, however. For multiple arc circuits copper
T-sleeves and for series circuits copper L-sleeves are used.

Telephone and telegraph cables are made of any required gauge of wire
and with from 1 to 150 conductors in a cable.

In jointing these the splices are never soldered, the conductors being joined either with a twist
joint or with the so-called Western Union splice. Each splice is covered with a cotton or silk
sleeve or a wrapping of tape, the latter being preferable, although considerably increasing
the time necessary for making the joint. Great care must be taken that no ends of wire are
left sticking up, for they will surely work their way through the tape and grounds, and crosses will
be the result. The wires should always be joined layer to layer and each splice very tightly taped
in order to get as much insulating compound around each splice as possible in the limited
space.

The splices should be "broken" as much as possible, so as to avoid having adjoining splices
coming over each other.

After the joint has been saturated with insulating compound the wires should have an outside
wrapping of tape to keep them in shape, and then the sleeve is wiped
on and filled.

If the insulation resistance of the jointed telegraph or telephone
cable is a quarter of what the cable tested in the factory, it may
be considered that an exceptionally good piece of work has been done.

I have spoken more particularly of fibrous lead covered cables, as the handling of them includes practically
every step of the work on any other kind of underground cable. In insulating dry core paper cables
a paper sleeve is slipped over the splice, and in rubber cables the splice is wrapped with rubber
tape; all other details are the same for these as for the fibrous cable.

In the laying of light and power cables every joint, as made, should be tested for insulation
with a Thomson galvanometer, as the insulation must necessarily be very high, and if one joint
or section of cable is any weaker than another it may be very important
in the future to know it.

All tests must be made after the joint has cooled, for while hot its insulation resistance will
be very low.

Tests for copper resistance should also be made to determine if the
splices are electrically perfect; an imperfect splice may cause considerable
trouble.

In telegraph and telephone cables the conductors should be of very soft copper, for in stripping
the conductor of insulation it is very easy to nick the wire, and
if of hard drawn copper open wires will be the result.

All work should be frequently tested for continuity with telephones, magnetos, or small portable
galvanometers.

It is only necessary to ground the conductors at one end and try each wire at the other end. For
this sort of work a telephone receiver used with one cell of some dry battery is most convenient,
and has the additional advantage of affording a means of communication
while testing, and is by far the best thing for identifying and tagging
conductors.

These cables should be frequently tested during the progress of the work for grounds and crosses
with a Thomson instrument, and when the cable is complete, a careful
series of tests of the capacity, insulation resistance, and copper
resistance of each wire should be made and the exact condition of
the cable determined before it is put in service, and thereafter an
intelligent oversight of the condition of the circuits can thus be
more readily maintained.

Where a company has extensive underground service, a regular cable gang should be in its employ,
for quick and safe handling of cables demands the employment of men accustomed to the work. If
the cable has been properly laid and tests show it to be in good
condition before current is turned on, almost the only trouble to
be anticipated will be due to mechanical injury.

Disruptive discharge, puncturing the lead, may occur; but the small chance of its occurring can
be greatly lessened by the use of some kind of "cable protector," which will provide for the spark
an artificial path of less resistance than the dielectric of the
condenser, which the cable in fact becomes.

If a fault suddenly develops on a circuit, the chances are it will be found in a manhole, and
an inspection of the cable in the manhole will generally reveal the trouble without resorting to
locating with a Wheatstone bridge.

The cable is often cut through at the edge of the duct, or damaged by something falling on it,
or by some one "walking all over it."

To guard against these, the ducts should always be fitted with protectors both above and below
the cable. The cables should never be left across the manholes, for they then answer the purpose
of a ladder, but should be bent, around the walls of the hole and securely fastened with lead straps,
that they may not be moved and the lead gradually worn through.

In telegraph cables, when one or two conductors "go," it will probably be useless to look for
trouble except with instruments; but if several wires are "lost"
at once it will probably be found to be caused by mechanical injury,
which can be located by inspection.

If it is ever necessary to loop out conductors, a joint can be readily opened and the conductors
wanted picked out and connected into the branch cable and the joint
again closed without disturbing the working wires.

In doing this a split sleeve must be used, and the only additional precaution to be taken is in
filling the sleeve to have the insulating compound not hot enough to melt the solder and open
up the split in the sleeve.

In cutting in service on light and power cables it is entirely practicable to do so without interruption
of service on multiple arc circuits, even those of very high voltage;
but they require great precaution and involve considerable risk to
the jointer, and where possible the circuit to which the connection
is to be made should previously be cut dead.

Where the voltage is not dangerous to human life, almost any service connection can be made without
interruption of service.

I have only indicated a very few of the operations that may be found necessary, and the probable
causes of troubles that may be encountered in the operating of underground circuits, believing
that the different problems that arise can, with a little experience, be successfully met by
any one who has a fair knowledge of the original construction of cable lines.--Electrical

RAILROADS TO THE CLOUDS

.
 There were many orchards around Rowe. The little city was surrounded with
bowing garlands of tenderest white and rose, the well-kept lawns in the city limits were like
velvet, and golden-spiked bushes and pink trails of flowering almond were beside the gates.
Lilacs also, flushed with rose, purpled the walls of old houses. One morning Ellen, on her
way to the factory, had for the first time that year a realization of the full presence of
the spring. All at once she knew the goddess to be there in her whole glory.

"Spring has really come," she said to Abby. As she spoke she jostled a great bush of white
flowers, growing in a yard close to the sidewalk, and an overpowering fragrance, like a very
retaliation of sweetness, came in her face.

"Yes," said Abby; "it seems more like spring than it did last night, somehow!"  Abby had gained
flesh, and there was a soft color on her cheeks, so that she was almost pretty, as she glanced
abroad with a sort of bright gladness and a face ready with smiles. Maria also looked in better
health than she had done in the winter. She walked with her arm through Ellen's.

Suddenly a carriage, driven rapidly, passed them, and Cynthia Lennox's graceful profile showed
like a drooping white flower in a window.

Sadie Peel came up to them with a swift run. "Say!" she said, "know who that was?"

"We've got eyes," replied Abby Atkins, shortly.

"Who said you hadn't? You needn't be so up an' comin', Abby Atkins; I didn't know as you knew
they were married, that's all. I just heard it from Lottie Snell, whose sister works at the
dressmaker's that made the wedding fix. Weddin' fix! My land! Think of a weddin' without a
white dress and a veil! All she had was a gray silk and a black velvet, and a black lace, and
a travellin'-dress!"

Abby Atkins eyed the other girl sharply, her curiosity getting the better of her dislike. "Who
did she marry?" said she, shortly. "I suppose she didn't marry the black velvet, or the lace,
or the travelling-dress. That's all you seem to think about."

"I thought you didn't know," replied Sadie Peel, in a tone of triumph. "They've kept it mighty
still, and he's been goin' there so long, ever since anybody can remember, that they didn't
think it was anything more now than it had been right along. Lyman Risley and Cynthia Lennox
have just got married, and they've gone down to Old Point Comfort. My land, it's nice to have
money, if you be half blind!"

Ellen looked after the retreating carriage, and made no comment.

She was pale and thin, and moved with a certain languor, although she held up her head proudly,
and when people asked if she were not well, answered quickly that she had never been better.
Robert had not been to see her yet. She had furtively watched for him a long time, then she
had given it up. She would not acknowledge to herself or any one else that she was not well
or was troubled in spirit. Her courage was quite equal to the demand upon it, yet always she
was aware of a peculiar sensitiveness to all happenings, whether directly concerned with herself
or not, which made life an agony to her, and she knew that her physical strength was not what
it had been. Only that morning she had looked at her face in the glass, and had seen how it
was altered. The lovely color was gone from her cheeks, there were little, faint, downward
lines about her mouth, and, more than that, out of her blue eyes looked the eternal, unanswerable
question of humanity, "Where is my happiness?"

It seemed to her when she first set out that she could not walk to the factory. That sense
of the full presence of the spring seemed to overpower her. All the revelation of beauty and
sweetness seemed a refinement of torture worse to bear than the sight of death and misery would
have been. Every blooming apple-bough seemed to strike her full on the heart.

"Only look at that bush of red flowers in that yard," Maria said once, and Ellen looked and
was stung by the sight as by the contact of a red flaming torch of spring. "What ails you,
dear; don't you like those flowers?" Maria said, anxiously.

"Yes, of course I do; I think they are lovely," replied Ellen, looking.

She looked after the carriage which contained the bridal party; she thought how the bridegroom
had almost lost his eyesight to save her, and her old adoration of Cynthia seemed to rise to
a flood-tide. Then came the thought of Robert, how he must have ceased to love her--how some
day he would be starting off on a bridal trip of his own. Maud Hemingway, with whom she had
often coupled him in her thoughts, seemed to start up before her, all dressed in bridal white.
It seemed to her that she could not bear it all. She continued walking, but she did not feel
the ground beneath her feet, nor even Maria's little, clinging fingers of tenderness on her
arm. She became to her own understanding like an instrument which is played upon with such
results of harmonies and discords that all sense of the mechanism is lost.

"Well, Ellen Brewster," said Sadie Peel, in her loud, strident voice, "I guess you wouldn't
have been walkin' along here quite so fine this mornin' if it hadn't been for Mr. Risley. You'd
ought to send him a weddin'-present--a spoon, or something."

"Shut up," said Abby Atkins; "Ellen has worried herself sick over him as it is."  She eyed
Ellen anxiously as she spoke. Maria clung more closely to her.

"Shut up yourself, Abby Atkins," returned Sadie Peel. "He's got a wife to lead him around,
and I don't see much to worry about. A great weddin'! My goodness, if I don't get married when
I'm young enough to wear a white dress and veil, catch me gettin' married at all!"

Sadie Peel sped on with her news to a group of girls ahead, and the wheels of the carriage
flashed out of sight in the spring sunlight. It was quite true that Risley and Cynthia had
been married that morning. He had not entirely lost his vision, although it would always be
poor, and he would live happily, although in a measure disappointedly, feeling that his partial
helplessness was his chief claim upon his wife's affection. He had gotten what he had longed
for for so many years, but by means which tended to his humiliation instead of his pride. But
Cynthia was radiant. In caring for her half-blind husband she attained the spiritual mountain
height of her life. She possessed love in the one guise in which he appealed to her, and she
held him fast to the illumination of her very soul.

After the carriage had passed out of sight Abby came close on the other side of Ellen and slid
her arm through hers. "Say!" she began.

"What is it?" asked Ellen.

Abby blushed. "Oh, nothing much," she replied, in a tone unusual for her. She took her arm
away from Ellen's, and laughed a little foolishly.

Ellen stared at her with grave wonder. She had not the least idea what she meant.

Abby changed the subject. "Going to the park opening to-night, Ellen?" she asked.

"No, I guess not."

"You'd better. Do go, Ellen."

"Yes, do go, Ellen; it will do you good," said Maria. She looked into Ellen's face with the
inexpressibly pure love of one innocent girl for another.

The park was a large grove of oaks and birch-trees which had recently been purchased by the
street railway company of Rowe, and it was to be used for the free entertainment of the people,
with an undercurrent of consideration for the financial profit of the company.

"I'm afraid I can't go," said Ellen.

"Yes, you can; it will do you good; you look like a ghost this morning," said Abby.

"Do go, Ellen," pleaded Maria.

However, Ellen would not have gone had it not been for a whisper of Abby's as they came out
of the factory that night.

"Look here, Ellen, you'd better go," said she, "just to show folks. That Sadie Peel asked me
this noon if it was true that you had something on your mind, and was worrying about--well,
you know what--that made you look so."

Ellen flushed an angry red. "I'll stop for you and Maria to-night," she answered, quickly.

"All right," Abby replied, heartily; "we'll go on the eight-o'clock car."

Ellen hurried home, and changed her dress after supper, putting on her new green silk waist
and her spring hat, which was trimmed with roses. When she went down-stairs, and told her mother
where she was going, she started up.

"I declare, I'd go too if your father had come home," she said. "I don't know when I've been
anywhere; and Eva was in this afternoon and said that she and Jim were going."

"I wonder where father is?" said Ellen, uneasily. "I don't know as I ought to go till he comes
home."

"Oh, stuff!" replied Fanny. "He's stopped to talk at the store. Oh, here he is now. Andrew
Brewster, where in the world have you been?" she began as he entered; but his mother was following
him, and something in their faces stopped her. Fanny Brewster had lived for years with this
man, but never before had she seen his face with just that expression of utter, unreserved
joy; although joy was scarcely the word for it, for it was more than that. It was the look
of a man who has advanced to his true measure of growth, and regained self-respect which he
had lost. All the abject bend of his aging back, all the apologetic patience of his outlook,
was gone. She stared at him, hardly believing her eyes. She was as frightened as if he had
looked despairing instead of joyful. "Andrew Brewster, what is it?" she asked. She tried to
smile, to echo the foolish width of grimace on his face, but her lips were too stiff.

Ellen looked at him, trembling, and very white under her knot of roses. Andrew held out a paper
and tried to speak, but he could not.

"For God's sake, what is it?" gasped Fanny.

Then Mrs. Zelotes spoke. "That old mining-stock has come up," said she, in a harsh voice. "He'd
never ought to have bought it. I should have told him better if he had asked me, but it's come
up, and it's worth considerable more than he paid for it. I've just been down to Mrs. Pointdexter's,
and Lawyer Samson was in there seeing her about a bond she's got that's run out, and he says
the mine's going to pay dividends, and for Andrew to hold on to part of it, anyhow. I bought
this paper, and it's in it. He never ought to have bought it, but it's come up. I hope it will
learn him a lesson. He's had enough trouble over it."

Nothing could exceed the mixture of recrimination and exultation with which the old woman spoke.
She eyed Fanny accusingly; she looked at Andrew with grudging triumph. "Lawyer Samson says
it will make him rich, he guesses; at any rate, he'll come out whole," said she. "I hope it
will learn you a lesson."

Andrew dropped into a chair. His face was distended with a foolish smile like a baby's. He
seemed to smile at all creation. He looked at his wife and Ellen; then his face again took
on its expression of joyful vacuity.

Fanny went close to him and laid a firm hand on his shoulder. "You 'ain't had a mite of supper,
Andrew Brewster," said she; "come right out and have something to eat."

Andrew shook his head, still smiling. His wife and daughter looked at him alarmedly, then at
each other. Then his mother went behind him, laid a hard, old hand on each shoulder, and shook him.

"If you have got a streak of luck, there's no need of your actin' like a fool about it, Andrew
Brewster," said she. "Go out and eat your supper, and behave yourself, and let it be a lesson
to you. Secondly, to use electrically deposited tubes. At first much was promised in this direction;
but up to the present time it can hardly be regarded as more than in the experimental stage.
Thirdly, to use the ordinary brazed or solid drawn tubes, and to re-enforce them by serving
with steel cord or steel or copper wire.

This has been tried, and found to answer perfectly. For economical reasons, as well as for insuring
the minimum of torsion to the material during manufacture, it is important to make as few bends
as possible; but in practice much less difficulty has been experienced in serving bent pipes in
a machine than would have been expected. Discarding copper, it has been proposed to substitute steel
or iron. In the early days of the higher pressures, Mr. Alexander Taylor adopted wrought iron
for steam pipes. One fitted in the Claremont in February, 1882, was recently removed from the
vessel for experimental purposes, and was reported upon by Mr. Magnus Sandison in a paper read
before the Northeast Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders.[2]
The following is a summary of the facts.

The pipe was 5 inches external diameter, and 0.375 inch thick. It was lap welded in the works
of Messrs. A. & J. Stewart. The flanges were screwed on and brazed externally. The pipe was not
lagged or protected in any manner. After eight and a half years' service the metal measured where
cut 0.32 and 0.375 inch in thickness, showing that the wasting during that time had been very
slight. The interior surface of the tube exhibited no signs of pitting
or corrosion.

It was covered by a thin crust of black oxide, the maximum thickness
of which did not exceed 1/32 inch.

Where the deposit was thickest it was curiously striated by the action
of the steam.

On the scale being removed, the original bloom on the surface of the metal was exposed. It would
thus appear that the danger from corrosion of iron steam pipes is not borne out in their actual
use; and hence so much of the way is cleared for a stronger and more reliable material than copper.
So far the source of danger seems to be in the weld, which would be inadmissible in larger pipes;
but there is no reason why these should not be lapped and riveted.

 The birches stood together in leaning, white-limbed groups
like maidens, and the rustling spread of the oaks shed broad flashes of silver from the moon.
In the midst of the grove the Hungarian orchestra played in a pavilion, and dancing was going
on there. Many of the people outside moved with dancing steps. Children in swings flew through
the airs with squeals of delight. There was a stand for the sale of ice-cream and soda, and
pretty girls blossomed like flowers behind the counters. There were various rustic adornments,
such as seats and grottos, and at one end of the grove was a small collection of wild animals
in cages, and a little artificial pond with swans. Now and then, above the chatter of the people
and the music of the orchestra, sounded the growl of a bear or the shrill screech of a paroquet,
and the people all stopped and listened and laughed. This little titillation of the unusual
in the midst of their sober walk of life affected them like champagne. Most of them were of
the poorer and middle classes, the employés of the factories of Rowe. They moved back and forth
with dancing steps of exultation.

"My, ain't it beautiful!" Fanny said, squeezing Andrew's arm. He had his wife on one arm, his
mother on the other. For him the whole scene appeared more than it really was, since it reflected
the joy of his own soul. There was for him a light greater than that of the moon or electricity
upon it--that extreme light of the world--the happiness of a human being who blesses in a moment
of prosperity the hour he was born. He knew for the first time in his life that happiness is
as true as misery, and no mere creation of a fairy tale. No trees of the Garden of Eden could
have outshone for him those oaks and birches. No gold or precious stones of any mines on earth
can equal the light of the little star of happiness in one human soul.

Fanny, as they walked along, kept looking at her husband, and her own face was transfigured.
Mrs. Zelotes, also, seemed to radiate with a sort of harsh and prickly delight. She descanted
upon the hard-earned savings which Andrew had risked, but she held her old head very high with
reluctant joy, and her bonnet had a rakish cant.

Ellen, with Abby and Maria, walked behind them.

Presently Andrew met another man who had also purchased stock in the mine, and stopped to exchange
congratulations. The man's face was flushed, as if he had been drinking, but he had not. On
his arm hung his wife, a young woman with a showy red waist and some pink ribbon bows on her
hat. She was teetering a little in time to the music, while a little girl clung to her skirts
and teetered also.

"Well, old man," said the new-comer, with a hoarse sound in his throat, "they needn't talk
to us any more, need they?"

"That's so," replied Andrew, but his joy in prosperity was not like the other man's. It placed
him heights above him, although from the same cause. Prosperity means one thing to one man,
and another to his brother.

Presently they met Jim Tenny and Eva and Amabel. They were walking three abreast, Amabel in
the middle. Jim Tenny looked hesitatingly at them, although his face was widened with irrepressible
smiles. Eva gazed at them with defiant radiance. "Well," said she, "so luck has turned?"

Amabel laughed out, and her laugh trilled high with a note of silver, above the chatter of
the crowd and the blare and rhythmic trill of the orchestra. "I've had an ice-cream, and I'm
going to have a new doll and a doll-carriage," said she. "Oh, Ellen!"  She left her father
and mother for a second and clung to Ellen, kissing her; then she was back.

"Well, Andrew?" said Jim. He had a shamed face, yet there was something brave in it struggling
for expression.

"Well, Jim?" said Andrew.

The two shook hands solemnly. Then they walked on together, and the sisters behind, with Amabel
clinging to her mother's hand. "Jim's goin' to work if he has had a little windfall," said
Eva, proudly. "Oh, Fanny, only think what it means!"

"I hope it will be a lesson to both of them," said Mrs. Zelotes, stalking along after, but
she smiled harshly.

"Oh, land, don't croak, if you've got a chance to laugh! There's few enough chances in this
world," cried Eva, with boisterous good humor. "As for me, I've come out of deep waters, and
I'm goin' to take what comfort I can in the feel of the solid ground under my feet."  She began
to force Amabel into a dance in time with the music, and the child shrieked with laughter.

"S'pose she's all right?" whispered Mrs. Zelotes to Fanny.

"Land, yes," replied Fanny; "it's just like her, just the way she used to do. It makes me surer
than anything else that she's cured."

The girls behind were loitering. Abby turned to Ellen and pointed to a rustic seat under a
clump of birches.

"Let's sit down there a minute, Ellen," said she.

"All right," replied Ellen. When she and Abby seated themselves, Maria withdrew, standing aloof
under an oak, looking up at the illumined spread of branches with the rapt, innocent expression
of a saint.

"Why don't you come and sit down with us, Maria?" Ellen called.

"In a minute," replied Maria, in her weak, sweet voice. Then John Sargent came up and joined her.

"She'll come in a minute," Abby said to Ellen. "She--she--knows I want to tell you something."

Abby hesitated. Ellen regarded her with wonder.

"Look here, Ellen," said Abby; "I don't know what you're going to think of me after all I've
said, but--I'm going to get married to Willy Jones. His mother has had a little money left
her, and she owns the house clear now, and I'm going to keep right on working; and--I never
thought I would, Ellen, you know; but I've come to think lately that all you can get out of
labor in this world is the happiness it brings you, and--the love. That's more than the money,
and--he wants me pretty bad. I suppose you think I'm awful, Ellen Brewster."  Abby spoke with
triumph, yet with shame. She dug her little toe into the shadow-mottled ground.

"Oh, Abby, I hope you'll be real happy," said Ellen. Then she choked a little.

"I've made up my mind not to work for nothing," said Abby; "I've made up my mind to get whatever
work is worth in this world if I can, and--to get it for him too."

"I hope you will be very happy," said Ellen again.

"There he is now," whispered Abby. She rose as Willy Jones approached, laughing confusedly.
"I've been telling Ellen Brewster," said Abby, with her perfunctory air.

Ellen held out her hand, and Willy Jones grasped it, then let it drop and muttered something.
He looked with helpless adoration at Abby, who put her hand through his arm reassuringly.

"Let's go and see the animals," said she; "I haven't seen the animals."

"I guess I'll go and see if I can find my father and mother," returned Ellen. "I want to see
my mother about something."

"Oh, come with us."  Abby grasped Ellen firmly around the waist and kissed her. "I don't love
him a mite better than I do you," she whispered; "so there! You needn't think you're left out,
Ellen Brewster."

"I don't," replied Ellen. She tried to laugh, but she felt her lips stiff. And unconquerable
feeling of desolation was coming over her, and in spite of herself her tone was somewhat like
that of a child who sees another with all the cake.

"I suppose you know Floretta got married last night," said Abby, moving off with Willy Jones.
John Sargent and Maria had long since disappeared from under the oak.

Ellen, left alone, looked for a minute after Abby and Willy, and noted the tender lean of the
girl's head towards the young man's shoulder; then she started off to find her father and mother.
She could not rid herself of the sense of desolation. She felt blindly that if she could not
get under the shelter of her own loves of life she could not bear it any longer. She had borne
up bravely under Robert's neglect, but now all at once, with the sight of the happiness of
these others before her eyes, it seemed to crush her. All the spirit in her seemed to flag
and faint. She was only a young girl, who would fall to the ground and be slain by the awful
law of gravitation of the spirit without love. "Anyway, I've got father and mother," she said
to herself.

She rushed on alone through the merry crowd. The orchestra was playing a medley. The violins
seemed to fairly pierce thought. A Roman-candle burst forth on the right with a great spluttering,
and the people, shrieking with delight, rushed in that direction. Then a rocket shot high in
the air with a splendid curve, and there was a sea of faces watching with speechless admiration
the dropping stars of violet and gold and rose.

Ellen kept on, moving as nearly as she could in the direction in which her party had gone.
Then suddenly she came face to face with Robert Lloyd.

She would have passed him without a word, but he stood before her.

"Won't you speak to me?" he asked.

"Good-evening, Mr. Lloyd," returned Ellen.

Then she tried to move on again, but Robert still stood before her.

"I want to say something to you," he said, in a low voice. "I was coming to your house to-night,
but I saw you on the car. Please come to that seat over there. There is nobody in that direction.
They will all go towards the fireworks now."

Ellen looked at him hesitatingly. At that moment she seemed to throw out protecting antennæ
of maidenliness; and, besides, there was always the memory of the cut in wages, for which she
still judged him; and then there was the long neglect.

"Please come," said Robert. He looked at her at once like a conqueror and a pleading child.
Ellen placed her hand on his arm, and they went to the seat under the clump of birches. They
were quite alone, for the whole great company was streaming towards the fireworks. A fiery
wheel was revolving in the distance, and rockets shot up, dropping showers of stars. Ellen
gazed at them without seeing them at all.

Robert, seated beside her, looked at her earnestly. "I am going to put back the wages on the
old basis to-morrow," he said.

Ellen made no reply.

"Business has so improved that I feel justified in doing so," said Robert. His tone was almost
apologetic. Never as long as he lived would he be able to look at such matters from quite the
same standpoint as that of the girl beside him. She knew that, and yet she loved him. She never
would get his point of view, and yet he loved her. "I have waited until I was able to do that
before speaking to you again," said Robert. "I knew how you felt about the wage-cutting. I
thought when matters were back on the old basis that you might feel differently towards me.
God knows I have been sorry enough for it all, and I am glad enough to be able to pay them
full wages again. And now, dear?"

"It has been a long time," said Ellen, looking at her little hands, clasped in her lap.

"I have loved you all the time, and I have only waited for that," said Robert.

Later on Robert and Ellen joined Fanny and the others. It was scarcely the place to make an
announcement. After a few words of greeting the young couple walked off together, and left
the Brewsters and Tennys and Mrs. Zelotes standing on the outskirts of the crowd watching the
fireworks. Granville Joy stood near them. He had looked at Robert and Ellen with a white face,
then he turned again towards the fireworks with a gentle, heroic expression. He caught up Amabel
that she might see the set piece which was just being put up. "Now you can see, Sissy," he said.

Eva looked away from the fireworks after the retreating pair, then meaningly at Fanny and Andrew.
"That's settled," said she.

Andrew's face quivered a little, and took on something of the same look which Granville Joy's
wore. All love is at the expense of love, and calls for heroes.

"It'll be a great thing for her," said Fanny, in his ear; "it'll be a splendid thing for her,
you know that, Andrew."

Andrew gazed after the nodding roses on Ellen's hat vanishing towards the right. Another rocket
shot up, and the people cried out, and watched the shower of stars with breathless enjoyment. It
is next passed through a sieve, and the suitably sized gravel makes an excellent material,
as it gives a clean appearance to the roof.

The thinking mind can easily go one step further and imagine that, since the tar contains a
number of volatile hydrocarbons, it might be made more adaptable for impregnation by paper by distilling
it, as by this process the fluid would lose its tendency to evaporate
and the percentage of resinous substances increase. Andrew looked for Ellen and Robert, and saw the girl's beautiful face turning backward
over her lover's shoulder. All his life Andrew had been a reader of the Bible, as had his father
and mother before him. To-day, ever since he had heard of his good fortune, his mind had dwelt
upon certain verses of Ecclesiastes. Now he quoted from them.

Ellen saw her father, and smiled and nodded, then she and her lover passed out of sight. Another
rocket trailed its golden parabola along the sky, and dropped with stars; there was an ineffably
sweet strain from the orchestra; the illuminated oaks tossed silver and golden boughs in a
gust of fragrant wind.  Then Andrew thought of the hard winter which had passed, as all hard
things must pass, of the toilsome lives of those beside him, of all the work which they had
done with their poor, knotted hands, of the tracks which they had worn on the earth towards
their graves, with their weary feet, and suddenly he seemed to grasp a new and further meaning
for that verse of Ecclesiastes.

He seemed to see that labor is not alone for itself, not for what it accomplishes of the tasks
of the world, not for its equivalent in silver and gold, not even for the end of human happiness
and love, but for the growth in character of the laborer.

"That is the portion of labor," he said. He spoke in a strained, solemn voice, as he had done
before. Nobody heard him except his wife and mother. His mother gave a sidewise glance at him,
then she folded her cape tightly around her and stared at the fireworks, but Fanny put her
hand through his arm and leaned her cheek against his shoulder.

THE END
