One night, after a long wrangle which ended in a discourse by the "father," a strange thing
happened. Larmy and It were contending as to whether It was merely a hypnotic influence on
the boy, of someone living whom they did not know, or what It claimed to be, a disembodied
spirit. By way of diversion, the reporter had just run a binder's needle under one of the boy's
finger-nails to see whether he would flinch. Then the Voice that was coming from David's mouth
spoke and said: "I will show you something to prove it;" and the entranced boy rose and went
to the back room, while the two others followed him.

He turned the lever that flashed the light on his linotype, and set the little motor going.
He lifted up the lid of the metal-pot, to see if the fire was keeping it molten. Then the boy
sat at the machine with his hands folded in his lap, gazing at the empty copy-holder out of
dead eyes. In a minute--perhaps it was a little longer--a brass matrix slipped from the magazine
and clicked down into the assembler; in a second or two another fell, and then, very slowly,
like the ticks of a great clock, the brasses slipped--slipped--slipped into their places, and
the steel spaces dropped into theirs. A line was formed, while the boy's hands lay in his lap.
When it was a full line he grabbed the lever, that sent the line over to the metal-pot to be
cast, and his hand fell back in his lap, while the dripping of the brasses continued and the
blue and white keys on the board sank and rose, although no finger touched them.

Larmy squinted at the thing, and held his long, fuzzy, unshaven chin in his hand. When the
second line was cast the reporter broke the silence with: "Well, I'll be damned!" And the Voice
from David's mouth replied: "Very likely." And the clicking of the brasses grew quicker.

Seven lines were cast and then the boy got up and went back to the couch in the front room,
where he yawned himself, apparently, through three strata of consciousness, into his normal
self. They took a proof of what had been cast, but it was in Latin and they could not translate
it. David himself forgot about it the next day, but the reporter, being impressed and curious,
took the proof to the teacher of Latin at the college, who translated it thus: "He shall go
away on a long journey across the ocean, and he shall not return, yet the whole town shall
see him again and know him--and he shall bring back the song that is in his heart, and you
shall hear it."

The next week the "Maine" was blown up, and in the excitement the troubles of David were forgotten
in the office. Moreover, as he had to work overtime he put his soul deeper into the machine,
and his nerves took on something of the steel in which he lived. The Associated Press report
was long in those days, and the paper was filled with local news of wars and rumours of wars,
so that when the call for troops came in the early spring, the town was eager for it, and David
could not wait for the local company to form, but went to Lawrence and enlisted with the Twentieth
Kansas. He was our first war-hero for thirty years, and the town was proud of him. Most of
the town knew why he went, and there was reproach for the blonde in the Racket Store, who had
told the girls it would be in June and that they were going East for a wedding trip.

When David came back from Lawrence an enlisted man, with a week in which to prepare for the
fray, the Imperial Club gave him a farewell dance of great pride, in that one end of Imperial
Hall was decorated for the occasion with all the Turkish rugs, and palms, and ferns, and piano-lamps
with red shades, and American flags draped from the electric fixtures, and all the cut-glass
and hand-painted punch-bowls that the girls of the T. T. T. Club could beg or borrow; and red
lemonade and raspberry sherbet flowed like water. Whereat David Lewis was so pleased that he
grew tearful when he came into the hall and saw the splendour that had been made for him. But
his soul, despite his gratitude to the boys and girls who gave the party, was filled with an
unutterable sadness; and he sat out many dances under the red lamp-shades with the various
girls who had been playing sister to him; and the boys to whom the girls were more than sisters
were not jealous.

As for the blonde, she beamed and preened and smiled on David, but her name was not on his
card, and as the silk-salesman was on the road, she had many vacant lines on her programme,
and she often sat alone by a card-table shuffling the deck that lay there. The boy's eyes were
dead when they looked at her and her smile did not coax him to her. Once when the others were
dancing an extra David sat across the room from her, and she went to him and sat by him, and
said under the music:

"I thought we were always going to be friends--David?" And after he had parried her for a while,
he rose to go away, and she said: "Won't you dance just once with me, Dave, just for old sake's
sake before you go?" And he put down his name for the next extra and thought of how long it
had been since the last June dance. Old sake's sake with youth may mean something that happened
only day before yesterday.

The boy did not speak to his partner during the next dance but went about debating something
in his mind; and when the number was ended he tripped over to the leader of the orchestra,
whom he had hired for dances a score of times, and asked for "Love's Golden Dream Is Past"
as the next "extra." It was his waltz and he didn't care if the whole town knew it--they would
dance it together. And so when the orchestra began he started away, a very heart-broken, brown-eyed,
olive-skinned little Welshman, who barely touched the finger-tips of a radiant, overdeveloped
blonde with roses in her cheeks and moonlight in her hair. She would have come closer to him
but he danced away and only hunted for her soul with his brown Celtic eyes. And because David
had asked for it and they loved the boy, the old men in the orchestra played the waltz over
and over again, and at the end the dancers clapped their hands for an encore, and when the
chorus began they sang it dancing, and the boy found the voice which cheered the "Men of Harlech,"
the sweet, cadent voice of his race, and let out his heart in the words.

When he led her to a seat, the blonde had tears on her eyelashes as she choked a "good-by,
Dave" to him, but he turned away without answering her and went to find his next partner. It
was growing late and the crowd soon went down the long, dark stairway leading from Imperial
Hall, into the moonlight and down the street, singing and humming and whistling "Love's Golden
Dream," and the next day they and the town and the band came down to the noon train to see
the conquering hero go.

It was lonesome in the office after David went, and his music-box in the corner was dumb, for
we couldn't find the brass lever for it, though the printers and the reporters hunted in his
trunk and in every place they could think of. But the lonesomest things in the world for him
were the machines. The big press grew sulky and kept breaking the web, and his linotype took
to absorbing castor-oil as if it were a kind of hasheesh. The new operator could run the new
machine, but David's seemed to resent familiarity. It was six months before we got things going
straight after he left us.

He wrote us soldier letters from the Presidio, and from mid-ocean, and from the picket-line
in front of Manila. One afternoon the messenger-boy came in snuffling with a sheet of the Press-report.
David's name was among the killed. Then we turned the column rules on the first page and got
out the paper early to give the town the news. Henry Larmy brought in an obituary, the next
day, which needed much editing, and we printed it under the head "A Tribute from a Friend,"
and signed Larmy's name to it.

The boy had no kith or kin--which is most unusual for a Welshman--and so, except in our office,
he seemed to be forgotten. A month went by, the season changed, and changed again, and a year
was gone, when the Government sent word to Larmy--whom the boy seemed to have named for his
next friend--that David's body would be brought back for burial if his friends desired it.
So in the fall of 1900, when the Presidential campaign was at its height, the conquering hero
came home, and we gave him a military funeral. The body came to us on Labor Day, and in our
office we consecrated the day to David. The band and the militia company took him from the
big stone church where sometimes he had gone to Sunday-school as a child, and a long procession
of townsfolk wound around the hill to the cemetery, where David received a salute of guns,
and the bugler played taps, and our eyes grew wet and our hearts were touched. Then we covered
him with flowers, whipped up the horses and came back to the world.

That night, as it was at the end of a holiday, the Republican Committee had assigned to our
town, for the benefit of the men in the shops, one of the picture-shows that Mark Hanna, like
a heathen in his blindness, had sent to Kansas, thinking our State, after the war, needed a
spur to its patriotism in the election. The crowd in front of the post-office was a hundred
feet wide and two hundred feet long, looking at the pictures from the kinetoscope--pictures
of men going to work in mills and factories; pictures of the troops unloading on the coast
of Cuba; pictures of the big warships sailing by; pictures of Dewey's flagship coming up the
Hudson to its glory; pictures of the Spanish ships lying crushed in Manila harbour.

Larmy and the reporter were sitting kicking their heels on the stone steps of the post-office
opposite the screen on which the pictures were flickering. Some they saw and others they did
not notice, for their talk was of David and of the strange things he had shown to them.

"How did you ever fix it up in your mind?" asked Larmy.

"I didn't fix it up. He was too many for me," was the reporter's answer.

"The little rooster couldn't have faked it up?" questioned Larmy.

"No--but he might have hypnotised us--or something."

"Yes--but still, he might have been hypnotised by something himself," suggested Larmy, and
then added: "That thing he did with the linotype--say, wasn't that about the limit? And yet
nothing has come of that prophecy. That's the trouble. I've seen dozens of those things, and
they always just come up to the edge of proving themselves, but always jump back. There is
always----"

"My God, Larmy, look--look!" cried the reporter.

And the two men looked at the screen before them, just as the backward sway of the crowd had
ceased and horror was finding a gasping voice upon the lips of the women; for there, walking
as naturally as life, out of the background of the picture, came David Lewis with his dark
sleeves rolled up, his peaked army hat on the back of his head, a bucket in his hand, and as
he stopped and grinned at the crowd--between the lightning-flashes of the kinetoscope--they
could see him wave his free hand. He stood there while a laugh covered his features, and he
put his hand in his pocket and drew out a key-ring, which he waved, holding it by some long,
stemlike instrument. Then he snapped back into nothing.

And the operator of the machine, being in a hurry to catch the ten-thirty train, went on with
his picture-show and gave us President McKinley and Mark Hanna sitting on the front steps of
the home in Canton, then followed the photograph of the party around the big table signing
the treaty of peace. As the crowd loosened and dissolved, Larmy and the reporter stood silently
waiting. Then, when they could get away together, the reporter said:

"Come, let's go over to the shop and think about this thing."

When they opened the office door, the rank odour of the machinery came to them with sickening
force. They left the front door open and raised the windows. The reporter began using a chisel
on the top of a little box with a Government frank on it, that had been placed upon the music-box
in the corner.

"We may as well see what David sent home," he grunted, as he jerked at the stubborn nails,
"anyway, I've got a theory."

Larmy was smoking hard. "Yes," he replied after a time; "we might as well open it now as any
time. The letter said all his things would be found there. I guess he didn't have a great deal.
Poor little devil, there was no one much to get things for but you fellows and maybe me, if
he thought of us."

By this time the box was opened, and the reporter was scooping things out upon the floor. There
was an army uniform, that had something clinky in the pockets, and wrapped in a magenta silk
handkerchief was a carved piece of ivory. In a camera plate-box was a rose, faded and crumbly,
a chip-diamond ring, a bangle bracelet, a woman's glove and a photograph. These Larmy looked
at as he smoked. They meant nothing to him, but the reporter dived into the clothes for the
clinky things. He came up with a bunch of keys, and on it was the long brass lever which unlocked
the music in the box.

"Here," he said as he jingled the keys, "is the last link in our chain." And he rose and went
over to the box, uncovered it, and jabbed in the lever with a nervous hand. There was a rolling
and clinking inside. Then, slowly, a harmony rose, and the tinkling that came from the box
resolved itself into a melody that filled the room. It was strong and clear and powerful, and
seemed to have a certain passion in it that may have been struck like flint fire from the time
and the place and the spirit of the occasion. The two men stared dumbly as they listened. The
sound rose stronger and stronger; over and over again the song repeated itself; then very gently
its strength began to fail; and finally it sank into a ghostly tinkle that still carried the
melody till it faded into silence.

"That," said the reporter, "is the song that was in his heart--'Love's Golden Dream.' I'm satisfied."

"The last link," shuddered Larmy. "That which seemed corporeal has melted 'as a breath into
the wind.'"

The reporter shovelled the debris into the box, pushed it under a desk, and the two men hurried
to close the office. As they stood on the threshold a moment, while the reporter clicked the
key in the lock, a paper rustled and they heard a mouse scamper across the floor inside the
empty room.

"Let's go home," shivered Larmy. They started north, which was the short way home, but Larmy
took hold of his companion's arm and said: "No, let's go this way: there's an electric light
here on the corner, and it's dark down there."

And so they turned into the white, sputtering glare and walked on without words.

V

The Coming of the Leisure Class

We all are workers in our town, as people are in every small town. It is always proper to ask
what a man does for a living with us, for none of us has money enough to live without work,
and until the advent of Beverly Amidon, our leisure class consisted of Red Martin, the gambler,
the only man in town with nothing to do in the middle of the day; and the black boys who loafed
on the south side of the bank building through the long afternoons until it was time to deliver
the clothes which their wives and mothers had washed. Everyone else in town works, and, excepting
an occasional picnic, there is no social activity among the men until after sundown. But five
years ago Beverly Amidon came to town, and brought with him a large leisure and a taste for
society which made him easily the "glass of fashion and the mould of form" not only in our
little community, but all over this part of the State. Beverly and his mother, who had come
to make their home with her sister, in one of the big houses on the hill, had money. How much,
we had no idea. In a small town when one has "money" no one knows just how much or how little,
but it must be over fifteen thousand dollars, otherwise one is merely "well fixed."

But Beverly was a blessing to our office. We never could have filled the society column Saturday
without him, for he was a continuous social performance. He was the first man in town who dared
to wear a flannel tennis suit on the streets, and he was a whole year ahead of the other boys
with his Panama hat. It was one of those broad-brimmed Panamas, full of heart-interest, that
made him look like a romantic barytone, and when under that gala façade he came tripping into
the office in his white duck clothes, with a wide Windsor tie, Miss Larrabee, the society editor,
who was the only one of us with whom he ever had any business, would pull the string that unhooked
the latch of the gate to her section of the room and say, without looking up: "Come into the
garden, Maud." To which he made invariable reply: "Oh, Miss Larrabee, don't be so sarcastic!
I have a little item for you."

The little item was always an account of one of his social triumphs. And there was a long list
of them to his credit. He introduced ping-pong; he gave us our first "pit party"; he held the
first barn dance given in the county; his was our first "tacky party"; and he gave the first
progressive buggy ride the young people had ever enjoyed, and seven girls afterward confessed
that on the evening of that affair he hadn't been in the buggy with them five minutes before
he began driving with one hand--and his right hand at that. Still, when the crowd assembled
for supper at Flat Rock, the girls didn't hold his left handiwork against him, and they admitted
that he was just killing when he put on one of their hats and gave an imitation of a girl from
Bethany College who had been visiting in town the week before. Beverly was always the life
of the company. He could make three kinds of salad dressing, two kinds of lobster Newburgh
and four Welsh rarebits, and was often the sole guest of honour at the afternoon meetings of
the T. T. T. girls, before whom he was always willing to show his prowess. Sometimes he gave
chafing-dish parties whereat he served ginger ale and was real devilish.

He used to ride around the country bare-headed with two or three girls when honest men were
at work, and he acquired a fine leather-coloured tan. He tried organising a polo club, but
the ponies from the delivery waggons that were available after six o'clock did not take training
well, and he gave up polo. In making horse-back riding a social diversion he taught a lot of
fine old family buggy horses a number of mincing steps, so that thereafter they were impossible
in the family phaeton. He thereby became unpopular with a number of the heads of families,
and he had to introduce bridge whist in the old married set to regain their favour. This cost
him the goodwill of the preachers, and he gave a Japanese garden party for the Epworth League
to restore himself in the church where he was accustomed to pass the plate on Sundays. Miss
Larrabee used to call him the first aid to the ennuied. But the Young Prince, who chased runaways
teams and wrote personal items, never referred to him except as "Queen of the Hand-holders."
For fun we once printed Beverly Amidon's name among those present at a Mothers' League meeting,
and it was almost as much of a hit in the town as the time we put the words, "light refreshments
were served and the evening was spent in cards and dancing," at the close of an account of
a social meeting of the Ministerial Alliance.

The next time Beverly brought in his little item he stopped long enough to tell us that he
thought that the people who laughed at our obvious mistake in the list of guests of the Mothers'
League were rather coarse. One word brought on two, and as it was late in the afternoon, and
the paper was out, we bade Beverly sit down and tell us the story of his life, and his real
name; for Miss Larrabee had declared a dozen times that Beverly Amidon sounded so much like
a stage name that she was willing to bet that his real name was Jabez Skaggs.

Beverly's greatest joy was in talking about his social conquests in Tiffin, Ohio; therefore
he soon was telling us that there was so much culture in Tiffin, such a jolly lot of girls,
so many pleasant homes, and a most extraordinary atmosphere of refinement. He rattled along,
telling us what great sport they used to have running down to Cleveland for theatre-parties,
and how easy it was to 'phone to Toledo and get the nicest crowd of boys one could wish to
come over to the parties, and how Tiffin was famous all over that part of Ohio for its exclusive
families and its week-end house-parties.

The Young Prince sat by listening for a time and then got up and leaned over the railing around
Miss Larrabee's desk. Beverly was confiding to us how he got up the sweetest living pictures
you ever saw and took them down to Cleveland, where they made all kinds of money for the King's
Daughters. He told what gorgeous costumes the girls wore and what stunning backgrounds he rigged
up. The Young Prince winked at Miss Larrabee as he straightened up and started for the door.
Then he let fly: "Were you Psyche at the Pool in that show, or a Mellin's Food Baby?"

But Beverly deigned no reply and a little later in the conversation remarked that the young
men in this town were very bad form. He thought that he had seen some who were certainly not
gentlemen. He really didn't see how the young ladies could endure to have such persons in their
set. He confided to Miss Larrabee that at a recent lawn-party he had come upon a young man,
who should be nameless, with his arm about a young woman's waist.

"And, Miss Larrabee," continued Beverly in his solemnest tones, "A young man who will put his
arm around a girl will go further--yes, Miss Larabee--much further. He will kiss her!" Whereat
he nodded his head and shook it at the awful thought.

Miss Larrabee drew in a shocked breath and gasped:

"Do you really think so, Mr. Amidon? I couldn't imagine such a thing!"

He had a most bedizened college fraternity pin, which he was forever lending to the girls.
During his first year in town, Miss Larrabee told us, at least a dozen girls had worn the thing.
Wherefore she used to call it the Amidon Loan Exhibit.

He introduced golf into our town, and was able to find six men to join his fifteen young ladies
in the ancient sport. Two preachers, a young dentist and three college professors were the
only male creatures who dared walk across our town in plaid stockings and knickerbockers, and
certainly it hurt their standing at the banks, for the town frowned on golf, and confined its
sport to baseball in the summer, football in the autumn, and checkers in the winter.

That was a year ago. In the autumn something happened to Beverly, and he had to go to work.
There was nothing in our little town for him, so he went to Kansas City. He did not seem to
"make it" socially there, for he wrote to the girls that Kansas City was cold and distant and
that everything was ruled by money. He explained that there were some nice people, but they
did not belong to the fast set. He was positively shocked, he wrote, at what he heard of the
doings at the Country Club--so different from the way things went in Tiffin, Ohio.

For a long time we did not hear his name mentioned in the office. Finally there came a letter
addressed to Miss Larrabee. In it Beverly said that he had found his affinity. "She is not
rich," he admitted, "but," he added, "she belongs to an old, aristocratic, Southern family,
through reduced circumstances living in retirement; very exclusive, very haughty. I have counted
it a privilege to be constantly associated with people of such rare distinction. Her mother
is a grand dame of the old school who has opened her home to a few choice paid guests who feel,
as I do, that it is far more refreshing socially to partake of the gracious hospitality of
her secluded home than to live in the noisy, vulgar hotels of the city. It was in this relation
at her mother's home that I met the woman who is to join her lot with mine." Thereafter followed
the date and place of the wedding, a description of the bride's dress, an account of her lineage
back to the "Revolutionary Georgia Governor of that name," and fifty cents in stamps for extra
papers containing an account of the wedding.

In time we hope to teach our young men to roll down their shirt-sleeves in the summer, our
girls to wear their hats, our horses to quit prancing in the shafts of the family buggy. In
time bridge whist will wear itself out, in time our social life will resume its old estate,
and the owners of the five dress-suits in town will return to their former distinction. In
time caste lines set by the advent of the leisure class will be obliterated, and it will be
no longer bad form for the dry-goods clerk to dance with the grocery clerk's wife at the Charity
Ball. But, come what may, we shall always know that there was a time in the social history
of our town when we danced the two-step as they dance it in Tiffin, Ohio, and wore knee-breeches
and plaid stockings, and quit work at four o'clock. Those were great days--"the glory that
was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome."

VI

The Bolton Girl's "Position"

When she said she would like to "accept a position" with our paper, it was all over between
us. After that we knew that she was at least highly improbable if not entirely impossible.
But then we might have expected as much from a girl who called herself Maybelle. There is,
however, this much to be said in Maybelle's favour: she was persistent. She did not let go
till it thundered! We could have stood it well enough if she had limited her campaign for a
job on the paper to an occasional call at the office. But she had a fiendish instinct which
told her who were the friends we liked most to oblige: the banker, for instance, who carried
our overdrafts, the leading advertiser, the chairman of the printing committee of the town
council--and she found ways to make them ask if we couldn't do something for Miss Bolton. She
could teach school; indeed, she had a place in the Academy. But she loathed school-teaching.
She had always felt that, if she could once get a start, she could make a name for herself.

She had written something that she called "A Critique on Hamlet," which she submitted to us,
and was deeply pained when we told her that we didn't care for editorial matter; that what
our paper needed was the names of the people in our own country town and county, printed as
many times a day or a week or a month as they could be put into type. We tried to tell her
that more important to us than the influence of the Celtic element on our national life and
literature was the fact that John Jones of Lebo--that is to say, red John, as distinguished
from black John--or Jones the tinner, or Jones of the Possum Holler settlement was in town
with a load of hay. "Other papers," we explained carefully, while she looked as sympathetic
and intelligent as a collie, "other papers might be interested in the radio-activity of uranium
X; they might care to print articles on the psychological phenomena of mobs"--to which she
snapped eager agreement with her eyes--"others, with entire propriety, might be interested
in inorganic evolution"--and she cheeped "yes, yes" with feverish intensity--"but in our little
local paper we cared only for the person who could tell our readers with the most delicacy
and precision how many spoons Mrs. Worthington had to borrow for her party, who had the largest
number of finger-bowls in town, what Mrs. Conklin paid for the broilers she served at her party
last February, and the name of the country woman who raised them, and why it was that all the
women failed to make Jennie's recipe for sunshine cake work when they tried it." Such are the
things that interest our people, and he, she or it who can turn in two or three columns a day
of items setting forth these things in a good-natured way, so that the persons mentioned will
only grin and wonder who told it, is good for ten dollars of our money every Saturday night.

Maybelle thought it was such interesting work, and her eyes floated in tears of happiness at
the thought of such joy. If she could only have a chance! It would be just lovely--simply grand,
and she knew she could do it! Something in her innermost soul thrilled with a tintinabulation
that made her quiver with anticipation. Whereupon she went out and came back in three days
with five sheets of foolscap on which she had written an article beginning: "When Memory draws
aside the curtains of her magic chamber, revealing the pictures meditation paints, and we see
through the windows of our dreams the sweet vale of yesterday, lying outside and beyond; when
stern Ambition, with relentless hand, turns us away from all this to ride in the sombre chariot
of Duty--then it is that entrancing Pleasure beckons us back to sit by Memory's fire and sip
our tea with Maiden meditation." What it was all about no one ever found out; but the Young
Prince at the local desk who read it clear through said that sometimes he thought that it was
a report of a fire and at other times it seemed like a dress-goods catalogue. It would have
made four columns. As he put the roll back in the drawer the Young Prince rose and paced grandly
out. At the front door he stopped and said: "You'll never make anything out of her--she's a
handholder! When a girl begins to get corns on her hands, I notice she has mush on the brain!"

But Maybelle returned, and we went all over the same ground again. We explained that what we
wanted was short items--two or three lines each--little references to home doings; something
telling who has company, who is sick, who is putting shingles on the barn or an "L" on the
house. And she said "Oh, yes!" so passionately that it seemed as though she would bark or put
her front feet on the table. One felt like taking her jaws in his hands and pulling her ears.

The next time she came in she said that if we would just try her--give her something to do--she
was sure she could show us how well she could do it. On a venture, and partly to get rid of
her, we sent her to the district convention of the Epworth League to write up the opening meeting.
About noon of the next day she brought in three sermons, and said that she didn't get the list
of officers nor the names of the choir because they were all people who lived here and everyone
knew them. Then we explained in short, simple sentences that the sermons were of no value,
and that the names were what we desired. She dropped her eyes and said meekly "Oh!" and told
us how sorry she was. Also she said that if it wasn't for a meeting of the T. T. T. girls that
afternoon she would go back and get the names. When she went out, the Young Prince, sitting
by the window with his pencil behind his ear and his feet on the table, said: "I bet she can
make the grandest fudge!" "And such lovely angel food," put in Miss Larrabee, who was busy
writing up the Epworth League convention.

Miss Bolton's name was always among the lists we printed of the guests at the Entre Nous Card
Club, the Imperial Dancing Club, the "Giddy Young Things" Club, the Art Club and the Shakespeare
Club. But when she came to the office she was full of anxiety at the frivolity of society.
She said that she so longed for intellectual companionship that she felt sometimes as if she
must fly to a place where she could find a soul that would feel in unison with the infinite
that thrilled her being. Far be it from her to wish to coin the pulsations of her soul, but
papa and mamma did need her help so. She accented papa and mamma on the last syllable and leaned
forward and looked upward like a shirtwaist Madonna. But writing locals someway didn't appeal
to her. She wondered if we could use a serial story. And then she went on: "Oh, I have some
of the sweetest things in my head! I know I could write them. They just tingle through my blood
like wine. I know I could write them--such sublime things--but when I sit down to put them
on paper something always comes up that prevents my going on with them. There are dozens whirling
through my brain begging to be written. There is one about the earl who has imprisoned the
young princess in a dungeon, and her lover, a knight of the cross, comes home from a crusade
and is put in the cell next to her. A bird that she has been feeding through her prison window
takes a lock of her golden hair to the window where her lover is looking out across the beautiful
world, not knowing that she, too, has fallen into the earl's clutches. And, oh, yes! there
is another about Cornelia who lived in a moated tower, and all the dukes and lords and kings
in the land had laid suit to her hand, and she could find none who came up to her highest ideal,
so she set them a task--and, oh, a lot more about what they did; I haven't thought that out--but
anyway she married the red duke Wolfang who spurned her task and took her by night with his
retainers away from the tower, saying her love was his Holy Grail and to get her was the object
of his pilgrimage. Oh, it's just grand."

No, we don't use serials and when we do we buy them in stereotyped plates by the pound. This
made Miss Bolton droop, with another disappointed "Oh." The grain of the world seems so coarse
when one looks at it closely.

We did not see Miss Bolton at the office for a long time after the duke abducted the lady in
the moated grange, but we received a poem signed M. B. "To Dan Cupid," and another on "My Heart
of Fire." Also there came an anonymous communication in strangely familiar fat vertical handwriting
to the effect that "some people in this town think that if a young lady has a gentleman friend
call on her more than twice a week it is their business to assume a courtship. They should
know that there are souls on this earth whose tendrils reach into the infinite beyond the gross
materiality of this mundane sphere to a destiny beyond the stars." At the bottom of the page
were the words: "Please publish and oblige a subscriber."

The next that we heard of Miss Bolton was that she was running pink and blue baby-ribbon through
her white things, and was expecting a linen shower from the T. T. T. girls, a silver shower
from the "Giddy Young Things," a handkerchief shower from the Entre Nous girls, and a kitchen
shower from the Imperial Club. Miss Larrabee, the society editor, began to hate Miss Bolton
with the white-hot hate which all society editors turn on all brides. Miss Larrabee was authority
for the statement that Maybelle had used five hundred yards of baby-ribbon--pink and blue and
white and yellow--in her trousseau, and that she was bestowing the same passionate fervour
on her hemstitching and tucking that she had wasted on literature; that she was helping papa
and mamma by shouldering the biggest wedding on them since the Tomlinsons went into bankruptcy
after their firework ceremonial. Miss Larrabee said that Papa Bolton's livery-stable was burning
up so fast that she wanted to call out the fire department, and that Mamma Bolton made her
think of the patent-medicine testimonials we printed from "poor tired women."

The day of the wedding the blow came. A very starched-up little boy with strawberry juice frescoed
around his mouth brought in a note from Maybelle and a tightly-rolled manuscript tied with
blue baby-ribbon. In the note she said that she thought it would be so romantic to "write up
her own wedding--recalling the dear, dead days when she was a neophyte in letters." We handed
the manuscript to Miss Larrabee, from whom, as she read, came snorts: "'Drawing-room!' Huh!
'Music-room.' Heavens to Betsy! 'Peculiar style of beauty!' Oh, joy! 'Looked like a wood-nymph
in the morn.' Wouldn't that saturate you! 'The Apollo-like beauty of the groom.'" Miss Larrabee
groaned as she rose, and putting her raincoat on the floor by her chair she exclaimed: "Do
you people know what I am going to do? I have got to lie right down here and have a fit!"

VII

"By the Rod of His Wrath"

Saturday afternoons, when the town is full, and farmers are coming in to the office to pay
their subscriptions for the Weekly, it is our habit, after the paper is out, to sit in the
office and look over Main Street, where perhaps five hundred people are milling, and consider
with one another the nature of our particular little can of angle-worms and its relation to
the great forces that move the world. The town often seems to us to be dismembered from the
earth, and to be a chunk of humanity drifting through space by itself, like a vagrant star,
forgotten of the law that governs the universe. Go where our people will, they find change;
but when they come home, they look out of the hack as they ride through town, seeing the old
familiar buildings and bill-boards and street-signs, and say with surprise, as Mathew Boris
said after a busy and eventful day in Kansas City, where he had been marketing his steers:
"Well, the old town seems to keep right on, just the same."

The old men in town seem always to have been old, and though the middle-aged do sometimes step
across the old-age line, the young men remain perennially young, and when they grow fat or
dry up, and their hair thins and whitens, they are still called by their diminutive names,
and to most of us they are known as sons of the old men. Here a new house goes up, and there
a new store is built, but they rise slowly, and everyone in town has time to go through them
and over them and criticise the architectural taste of the builders, so that by the time a
building is finished it seems to have grown into the original consciousness of the people,
and to be a part of their earliest memories. We send our children to Sunday-school, and we
go to church and learn how God's rewards or punishments fell upon the men of old, as they were
faithful or recreant; but we don't seem to be like the men of old, for we are neither very
good nor very bad--hardly worth God's while to sort us over for any uncommon lot. Only once,
in the case of John Markley, did the Lord reach into our town and show His righteous judgment.
And that judgment was shown so clearly through the hearts of our people that very likely John
Markley does not consider it the judgment of God at all, but the prejudice of the neighbours.

When we have been talking over the case of John Markley in the office we have generally ended
by wondering whether God--or whatever one cares to call the force that operates the moral laws,
as well as those that in our ignorance we set apart as the physical laws of the world--whether
God moves by cataclysm and accidents, or whether He moves with blessing or chastisement, through
human nature as it is, in the ordinary business of the lives of men. But we have never settled
that in our office any more than they have in the great schools, and as John Markley, game
to the end, has never said what he thought of the town's treatment of him, it will never be
known which side of our controversy is right.

Years ago, perhaps as long ago as the drought of seventy-four, men began calling him "Honest
John Markley." He was the fairest man in town, and he made money by it, for when he opened
his little bank Centennial year, which was the year of the big wheat crop, farmers stood in
line half an hour at a time, at the door of his bank, waiting to give him their money. He was
a plain, uncollared, short-whiskered man, brown-haired and grey-eyed, whose wife always made
his shirts and, being a famous cook in town, kept him round and chubby. He referred to her
as "Ma," and she called him "Pa Markley" so insistently that when we elected him State Senator,
after he made his bank a National bank, in 1880, the town and county couldn't get used to calling
him Senator Markley, so "Pa Markley" it was until after his Senatorial fame had been forgotten.
Their children had grown up and left home before the boom of the eighties came--one girl went
to California and the boy to South America;--and when John Markley began to write his wealth
in six figures--which is almost beyond the dreams of avarice in a town like ours--he and his
wife were lonely and knew little what to do with their income.

They bought new furniture for the parlour, and the Ladies' Missionary Society of the First
Methodist Church, the only souls that saw it with the linen jackets off, say it was lovely
to behold; they bought everything the fruit-tree man had in his catalogue, and their five acres
on Exchange Street were pimpled over with shrubs that never bloomed and with trees that never
bore fruit. He passed the hat in church--being a brother-in-law to the organisation, as he
explained; sang "Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys Are Marching" at Grand Army entertainments,
and always as an encore dragged "Ma" out to sing with him "Dear, Dear, What Can the Matter
Be." She was a skinny, sharp-eyed, shy little woman in her late fifties when the trouble came.
She rose at every annual meeting of the church to give a hundred dollars but her voice never
lasted until she got through announcing her donation, and she sat down demurely, blushing and
looking down her nose as though she had disgraced the family. She had lost a brother in the
war, and never came further out of mourning than purple flowers in her bonnet. She bought John
Markley's clothes, so that his Sunday finery contained nothing giddier than a grey made-up
tie, that she pinned around the collars which her own hands had ironed.

Slowly as their fortune piled up, and people said they had a million, his brown beard grizzled
a little, and his brow crept up and up and his girth stretched out to forty-four. But his hands
did not whiten or soften, and though he was "Honest John," and every quarter-section of land
that he bought doubled in value by some magic that he only seemed to know, he kept the habits
of his youth, rose early, washed at the kitchen basin, and was the first man at his office
in the morning. At night, after a hard day's work he smoked a cob-pipe in the basement, where
he could spit into the furnace and watch the fire until nine o'clock, when he put out the cat
and bedded down the fire, while "Ma" set the buckwheat cakes. They never had a servant in their
house.

We used to see John Markley pass the office window a dozen times a day, a hale, vigorous man,
whose heels clicked hard on the sidewalk as he came hurrying along--head back and shoulders
rolling. He was a powerful, masculine, indomitable creature, who looked out of defiant, cold,
unblinking eyes as though he were just about to tell the whole world to go to hell! The town
was proud of him. He was our "prominent citizen," and when he was elected president of the
district bankers' association, and his name appeared in the papers as a possible candidate
for United States Senator or Minister to Mexico or Secretary of the Interior, we were glad
that "Honest John Markley" was our fellow-townsman.

And then came the crash. Man is a curious creature, and, even if he is nine parts good, the
old Adam in him must burn out one way or another in his youth, or there comes a danger period
at the height of his middle life when his submerged tenth that has been smouldering for years
flares up and destroys him. Wherefore the problem which we have never been able to solve, though
we have talked it over in the office a dozen times: whether John Markley had begun to feel,
before he met the Hobart woman, that he wasn't getting enough out of life for the money he
had invested in it; or whether she put the notion in his head.

It is scarcely correct to speak of his having met her, for she grew up in the town, and had
been working for the Markley Mortgage and Investment Company for half-a-dozen years before
he began to notice her. From a brassy street-gadding child of twelve, whose mother crowded
her into grown-up society before she left the high school, and let her spell her name Ysabelle,
she had grown into womanhood like a rank weed; had married at nineteen, was divorced at twenty-one,
and having tried music teaching and failed, china painting and failed, she learned stenography
by sheer force of her own will, with no instruction save that in her book, and opened an office
for such work as she could get, while aiming for the best job in town--the position of cashier
and stenographer for the Markley Mortgage Company. It took her three years to get in and another
year to make herself invaluable. She was big and strong, did the work of two men for the pay
of one, and for five years John Markley, who saw that she had plenty of work to do, did not
seem to know that she was on earth. But one day "Alphabetical" Morrison, who was in our office
picking up his bundle of exchanges, looked rather idly out of the window, and suddenly rested
his roving eyes upon John Markley and Mrs. Hobart, standing and talking in front of the post
office. The man at the desk near Morrison happened to be looking out at that moment, and he,
too, saw what Morrison saw--which was nothing at all, except a man standing beside a woman.
Probably the pair had met in exactly the same place at exactly the same time, and had exchanged
an idle word daily for five years! and no one had noticed it, but that day Morrison unconsciously
put his hand to his chin and scratched his jaw, and his eyes and the man's at the desk beside
him met in a surprised interrogation, and Morrison's mouth and nose twitched, and the other
man said, as he turned his face into his work, "Well, wouldn't that get you!"

The conversation went no further. Neither could have said what he saw. But there is something
in every human creature--a survival of our jungle days, which lets our eyes see more than our
consciousness records in language. And these men, who saw Markley and the woman, could not
have defined the canine impression which he gave them. Yet it was there. The volcano was beginning
to smoke.

It was a month later before the town saw the flames. During that time John Markley had been
walking to and from his midday dinner with Isabel Hobart, had been helping her on and off with
her wraps in the office, and had been all but kicking up the dirt behind him and barking around
her, as the clerks there told us, without causing comment. An honest man always has such a
long start when he runs away from himself that no one misses him until he is beyond extradition.
Matters went along thus for nearly a year before the woman in the cottage on Exchange Street
knew how they stood. And that speaks well of our town; for we are not a mean town, and if anyone
ever had our sympathy it was Mrs. Markley, as she went about her quiet ways, giving her missionary
teas, looking after the poor of her church, making her famous doughnuts for the socials, doing
her part at the Relief Corps chicken-pie suppers, digging her club paper out of the encyclopædia,
and making over her black silk the third time for every day. If John Markley was cross with
her in that time--and the neighbours say that he was; if he sat for hours in the house without
saying a word, and grumbled and flew into a rage at the least ruffling of the domestic waters--his
wife kept her grief to herself, and even when she left town to visit her daughter in California
no one knew what she knew.

A month passed, two months passed, and John Markley's name had become a by-word and a hissing.
Three months passed, a year went by, and still the wife did not return. And then one day Ab
Handy, who sometimes prepared John Markley's abstracts, came into our office and whispered
to the man at the desk that there was a little paper filed in the court which, under the circumstances,
Mr. Markley would rather we would say as little about as is consistent with our policy in such
cases. Handy didn't say what it was, and backed out bowing and eating dirt, and we sent a boy
hot-foot to the court-house to find out what had been filed. The boy came back with a copy
of a petition for divorce that had been entered by John Markley, alleging desertion. John Markley
did not face the town when he brought his suit, but left for Chicago on the afternoon train,
and was gone nearly a month. The broken little woman did not come back to contest the case,
and the divorce was granted.

The day before his marriage to Isabel Hobart, John Markley shaved off his grizzled brown beard,
and showed the town a face so strong and cunning and brutal that men were shocked; they said
that she wished to make him appear young, and the shave did drop ten years from his countenance;
but it uncovered his soul so shamelessly that it seemed immodest to look at his face. Upon
the return from the wedding trip, the employees of the Markley Mortgage Company, at John Markley's
suggestion, gave a reception for the bride and groom, and the Lord laid the first visible stripe
on John Markley while he stood with his bride for three hours, waiting for the thousand invited
guests who never came. "Alphabetical" Morrison, who owed John Markley money, and had to go,
told us in the office the next day that John Markley in evening clothes, with his great paunch
swathed in a white silk vest, smirking like a gorged jackal, showing his fellow-townsmen for
the first time his coarse, yellow teeth and his thin, cruel lips, looked like some horrible
cartoon of his former self. Colonel Morrison did not describe the bride, but she passed our
office that day, going the rounds of the dry-goods stores, giggling with the men clerks--a
picture of sin that made men wet their lips. She was big, oversexed, and feline; rattling in
silks, with an aura of sensuousness around her which seemed to glow like a coal, without a
flicker of kindness or shame or sweetness, and which all the town knew instinctively must clinker
into something black and ugly as the years went by.

So the threshold of the cottage on Exchange Street was not darkened by our people. And when
the big house went up--a palace for a country town, though it only cost John Markley $25,000--he,
who had been so reticent about his affairs in other years, tried to talk to his old friends
of the house, telling them expansively that he was putting it up so that the town would have
something in the way of a house for public gatherings; but he aroused no responsive enthusiasm,
and long before the big opening reception his fervour had been quenched. Though we are a curious
people, and though we all were anxious to know how the inside of the new house looked, we did
not go to the reception; only the socially impossible, and the travelling men's wives at the
Metropole, whom Mrs. Markley had met when she was boarding during the week they moved, gathered
to hear the orchestra from Kansas City, to eat the Topeka caterer's food, and to fall down
on the newly-waxed floors of the Markley mansion. But our professional instinct at the office
told us that the town was eager for news of that house, and we took three columns to write
up the reception. Our description of the place began with the swimming pool in the cellar and
ended with the ballroom in the third story.

It took John Markley a long time to realise that the town was done with him, for there was
no uprising, no demonstration, just a gradual loosening of his hold upon the community. In
other years his neighbours had urged him and expected him to serve on the school-board, of
which he had been chairman for a dozen years, but the spring that the big house was opened
Mrs. Julia Worthington was elected in his place. At the June meeting of the Methodist Conference
a new director was chosen to fill John Markley's place on the college board, and when he cancelled
his annual subscription no one came to ask him to renew it. In the fall his party selected
a new ward committeeman, and though Markley had been treasurer of the committee for a dozen
years, his successor was named from the Worthington bank, and they had the grace not to come
to Markley with the subscription-paper asking for money. It took some time for the sense of
the situation to penetrate John Markley's thick skin; whereupon the fight began in earnest,
and men around town said that John Markley had knocked the lid off his barrel. He doubled his
donation to the county campaign fund; he crowded himself at the head of every subscription-paper;
and frequently he brought us communications to print, offering to give as much money himself
for the library, or the Provident Association, or the Y. M. C. A., as the rest of the town
would subscribe combined. He mended church roofs under which he never had sat; he bought church
bells whose calls he never heeded; and paid the greater part of the pipe-organ debts in two
stone churches. Colonel Morrison remarked in the office one day that John Markley was raising
the price of popular esteem so high that none but the rich could afford it. "But," chuckled
the Colonel, "I notice old John hasn't got a corner on it yet, and he doesn't seem to have
all he needs for his own use." The wrench that had torn open his treasure chest, had also loosened
John Markley's hard face, and he had begun to smile. He became as affable as a man may who
has lived for fifty years silent and self-contained. He beamed upon his old friends, and once
or twice a week he went the rounds of the stores making small purchases, to let the clerks
bask in his sunlight.

If a new preacher came to town the Markleys went to his church, and Mrs. Markley tried to be
the first woman to call on his wife.

All the noted campaign speakers assigned to our town were invited to be the Markleys' guests,
and Mrs. Markley sent her husband, red necktied, high-hatted and tailor-made, to the train
to meet the distinguished guest. If the man was as much as a United States Senator, Markley
hired the band, and in an open hack rode in solemn state with his prize through the town behind
the tinkling cymbals, and then, with much punctility, took the statesman up and down Main Street
afoot, into all the stores and offices, introducing him to the common people. At such times
John Markley was the soul of cordiality; he seemed hungry for a kind look and a pleasant word
with his old friends. About this time his defiant eyes began to lose their boring points, and
to wander and hunt for something they had lost. When we had a State convention of the dominant
party, the Markleys saw to it that the Governor and all the important people attending, with
their wives, stopped in the big house. The Markleys gave receptions to them, which the men
in our town dared not ignore, but sent their wives away visiting and went alone. This familiarity
with politicians probably gave the Markleys the idea that they might help their status in the
community if John Markley ran for Governor. He announced his candidacy, and the Kansas City
papers, which did not appreciate the local situation, spoke well of him; but his boom died
in the first month, when some of his old friends called at the back room of the bank to tell
him that the Democrats would air his family affairs if he made another move. He looked up pitiably
into Ab Handy's face when the men were done talking and said: "Don't you suppose they'll ever
quit? Ain't they no statute of limitation?" And then he arose and stood by his desk with one
arm akimbo and his other hand at his temple as he sighed: "Oh hell, Ab--what's the use? Tell
'em I'm out of it!"

Mrs. Markley seems to have shut him out of the G. A. R., thinking maybe that the old boys and
their wives were not of her social level, or perhaps she had some idea of playing even with
them, because their wives had not recognised her; but she shut away much of her husband's social
comfort when she barred his comrades, and they in turn grew harder toward him than they were
at first. As the Markleys entered their second year, Mrs. Markley alone in the big house, with
only the new people from the hotel to eat her dinners, and with only the beer-drinking crowd
from the West Side to dance in the attic ballroom, had much time to think, and she bethought
her of the lecturers who were upon the college lecture course, whereupon John Markley had to
carve for authors and explorers, and an occasional Senator or Congressman, who, after a hard
evening's work on the platform, paid for his dinner and lodging by sitting up on a gilded high-backed
and uncomfortable chair in the stately reception-room of the Markley home, talking John Markley
into a snore, before Isabel let them go to bed. Isabel sent the accounts of these affairs to
the office for us to print, with the lists of invited guests, who never accepted. And the town
grinned.

At the end of two years John Markley's fat wit told him that it was a losing fight. He had
been dropped from the head of the Merchants' Association; he was cut off from the executive
committee of the Fair; he was not asked to serve on the railroad committee. His old friends,
whom he asked over to spend the evening at his house, always had good excuses, which they gave
him later over the telephone, and their wives, who used to call him by his first name, scarcely
recognised him on the street. He quit coming to our office with pieces for the paper telling
the town his views on this or that local matter; and gradually gave up the fight for his old
place on the school board.

The clerks in the Markley Mortgage Company office say that he fell into a moody way, and would
come to the office and refuse to speak to anyone for hours. Also, as the big house often glowed
until midnight for a dance of the socially impossible who used the Markley ballroom, rent free,
as a convenience, John Markley grew to have a sleepy look by day, and lines came into his red,
shaved face. He grew anxious about his health, and a hundred worries tightened his belt and
shook his great fat hand, just the least in the world, and when through some gossip that his
wife brought him from the kitchen he felt the scorn of an old friend burn his soul like a caustic,
for many days he would brood over it. Finally care began to chisel down his flinty face, to
cut the fat from his bull neck, so that the cords stood out, and, through staring in impotent
rage and pain at the ceiling in the darkness of the night, red rims began to worm around his
eyes. He was not sixty years old then, and he had lashed himself into seventy.

However his money-cunning did not grow dull. He kept his golden touch and his impotent dollars
piled higher and higher. The pile must have mocked Isabel Markley, for it could bring her nothing
that she wanted. She stopped trying to give big parties and receptions. Her social efforts
tapered down to little dinners for the new people in town. But as the dinner hour grew near
she raged--so the servants said--whenever the telephone rang, and in the end she had to give
up even the dinner scheme.

So there came a time when they began to take trips to the seashore and the mountains, flitting
from hotel to hotel. In the office we knew when they changed quarters, for at each resort John
Markley would see the reporters and give out a long interview, which was generally prefaced
by the statement that he was a prominent Western capitalist, who had refused the nomination
for Governor or for Senator, or for whatever Isabel Markley happened to think of; and papers
containing these interviews, marked in green ink, came addressed to the office in her stylish,
angular hand. During grand opera season one might see the Markleys hanging about the great
hotels of Chicago or Kansas City, he a tired, sleepy-faced, prematurely old man, who seemed
to be counting the hours till bed-time, and she a tailored, rather overfed figure, with a freshly
varnished face and unhealthy, bright, bold eyes, walking slightly ahead of her shambling companion,
looking nervously about her in search of some indefinite thing that was gone from her life.

One day John Markley shuffled into our office, bedizened as usual, and fumbled in his pocket
for several minutes before he could find the copy of the Mexican Herald containing the news
of his boy's death in Vera Cruz. He had passed the time of life for tears, yet when he asked
us to reprint the item he said sadly: "The old settlers will remember him--maybe. I don't know
whether they will or not." He seemed a pitiful figure as he dragged himself out of the office--so
stooped and weazened, and so utterly alone, but when he turned around and came back upon some
second thought, his teeth snapped viciously as he snarled: "Here, give it back. I guess I don't
want it printed. They don't care for me, anyway."

The boys in his office told the boys in our office that the old man was cross and petulant
that year, and there is no doubt that Isabel Markley was beginning to find her mess of pottage
bitter. The women around town, who have a wireless system of collecting news, said that the
Markleys quarrelled, and that she was cruel to him. Certain it is that she began to feed on
young boys, and made the old fellow sit up in his evening clothes until impossible hours, for
sheer appearance sake, while his bed was piled with the wraps of boys and girls from what our
paper called the Hand-holders' Union, who were invading the Markley home, eating the Markley
olives and canned lobster, and dancing to the music of the Markley pianola. Occasionally a
young travelling man would be spoken of by these young people as Isabel Markley's fellow.

Mrs. Markley began to make fun of her husband to the girls of the third-rate dancing set whose
mothers let them go to her house; also, she reviled John Markley to the servants. It was known
in the town that she nicknamed him the "Goat." As for Markley, the fight was gone from him,
and his whole life was devoted to getting money. That part of his brain which knew the accumulative
secret kept its tireless energy; but his emotions, his sensibilities, his passions seemed to
be either atrophied or burned out, and, sitting at his desk in the back room of the Mortgage
Company's offices, he looked like a busy spider spinning his web of gold around the town. It
was the town theory that he and Isabel must have fought it out to a finish about the night
sessions; for there came a time when he went to bed at nine o'clock, and she either lighted
up and prepared to celebrate with the cheap people at home, or attached one of her young men,
and went out to some impossible gathering--generally where there was much beer, and many risqué
things said, and the women were all good fellows. And thus another year flew by.

One night, when the great house was still, John Markley grew sick and, in the terror of death
that, his office people say, was always with him, rose to call for help. In the dark hall,
feeling for an electric-light switch, he must have lost his way, for he fell down the hard
oak stairs. It was never known how long he lay there unable to move one-half of his body, but
his wife stood nearly an hour at the front door that night, and when she finally switched on
the light, she and the man with her saw Markley lying before them with one eye shut and with
half his face withered and dead, the other half around the open eye quivering with hate. He
choked on an oath, and shook at her a gnarled bare arm. Her face was flushed, and her tongue
was unsure, but she laughed a shrill, wicked laugh and cried: "Ah, you old goat; don't you
double your fist at me!"

Whereupon she shuddered away from the shaking figure at her feet and scurried upstairs. And
the man standing in the doorway, wondering what the old man had heard, wakened the house, and
helped to carry John Markley upstairs to his bed.

It was nearly three months before he could be wheeled to his office, where he still sits every
day, spinning his golden web and filling his soul with poison. They say that, helpless as he
is, he may live for a score of years. Isabel Markley knows how old she will be then. A thousand
times she has counted it.

To see our town of a summer twilight, with the families riding abroad behind their good old
nags, under the overhanging elms that meet above our newly-paved streets, one would not think
that there could exist in so lovely a place as miserable a creature as John Markley is; or
as Isabel, his wife, for that matter. The town--out beyond Main Street, which is always dreary
and ugly with tin gorgons on the cornices--the town is a great grove springing from a bluegrass
sod, with porch boxes making flecks of colour among the vines; cannas and elephant ears and
foliage plants rise from the wide lawns; and children bloom like moving flowers all through
the picture.

There are certain streets, like the one past the Markley mansion, upon which we make it a point
always to drive with our visitors--show streets we may as well frankly call them--and one of
these leads down a wide, handsome street out to the college. There the town often goes in its
best bib and tucker to hear the lecturers whom Mrs. Markley feeds. Last winter one came who
converted Dan Gregg--once Governor, but for ten years best known among us as the town infidel.
The lecturer explained how matter had probably evolved from some one form--even the elements
coming in a most natural way from a common source. He made it plain that all matter is but
a form of motion; that atoms themselves are divided into ions and corpuscles, which are merely
different forms of electrical motion, and that all this motion seems to tend to one form, which
is the spirit of the universe. Dan said he had found God there, and, although the pious were
shocked, in our office we were glad that Dan had found his God anywhere. While we were sitting
in front of the office one fine evening this spring, looking at the stars and talking of Dan
Gregg's God and ours, we began to wonder whether or not the God that is the spirit of things
at the base of this material world might not be indeed the spirit that moves men to execute
His laws. Men in the colleges to-day think they have found the moving spirit of matter; but
do they know His wonderful being as well as the old Hebrew prophets knew it who wrote the Psalms
and the Proverbs and the wisdom of the Great Book. That brought us back to the old question
about John Markley. Was it God, moving in us, that punished Markley "by the rod of His wrath,"
that used our hearts as wireless stations for His displeasure to travel through, or was it
the chance prejudice of a simple people? It was late when we broke up and left the office--Dan
Gregg, Henry Larmy, the reporter, and old George. As we parted, looking up at the stars where
our ways divided out under the elms, we heard, far up Exchange Street, the clatter of the pianola
in the Markley home, and saw the high windows glowing like lost souls in the night.

"A Bundle of Myrrh"

One of the first things that a new reporter on our paper has to learn is the kinology of the
town. Until he knows who is kin to whom, and how, a reporter is likely at any time to make
a bad break. Now, the kinology of a country town is no simple proposition. After a man has
spent ten years writing up weddings, births and deaths, attending old settlers' picnics, family
reunions and golden weddings, he may run into a new line of kin that opens a whole avenue of
hitherto unexplainable facts to him, showing why certain families line up in the ward primaries,
and why certain others are fighting tooth and toe-nail.

The only person in town who knows all of our kinology--and most of that in the county, where
it is a separate and interminable study--is "Aunt" Martha Merryfield. She has lived here since
the early fifties, and was a Perkins, one of the eleven Perkins children that grew up in town;
and the Perkinses were related by marriage to the Mortons, of whom there are over fifty living
adult descendants on the town-site now. So one begins to see why she is called "Aunt Martha"
Merryfield. She is literally aunt to over a hundred people here, and the habit of calling her
aunt has spread from them to the rest of the population.

She lives alone in the big brick house on the hill, though her children and grandchildren and
great-grandchildren are in and out all day and most of the night, so that she is not at all
lonesome. She is the only person to whom we can look for accurate information about local history,
and when a man dies who has been at all prominent in affairs of the town or county or State,
we always call up "Aunt" Martha on the 'phone, or send a reporter to her, to learn the real
printable and unprintable truth about him. She knows whom he "went with" before he was married,
and why they "broke off," and what crowd he associated with in the early days; how he got his
money, and what they used to "say" about him. If a family began putting on frills, she can
tell how the head of the house got his start by stealing "aid" sent to the grasshopper sufferers
and opening a store with the goods. If a woman begins speaking of the hired girl as her "maid,"
contrary to the vernacular rules of the town, Aunt Martha does not hesitate to bring up the
subject of the flour-sack underwear which the woman wore when she was a girl during the drought
of '60.

Aunt Martha used to bring us flowers for the office table, and it was her delight to sit down
and take out her corn-knife--as she called it--and go after the town shams. She has promised
a dozen times to write an article for the paper, which she says we dare not print, entitled
"Self-made Women I Have Known." She says that men were always bragging about how they had clerked,
worked on farms, dug ditches and whacked mules across the plains before the railroads came;
but that their wives insisted that they were princesses of the royal blood. She says she is
going to include in her Self-made Women only those who have worked out, and she maintains that
we will be surprised at the list.

Her particular animosity in the town is Mrs. Julia Neal Worthington. Aunt Martha told us that
when Tim Neal came to town he had a brogue you could scrape with a knife and an "O" before
his name you could hoop a hogshead with. "And that woman," exclaimed Aunt Martha, when she
was under full sail, "that woman, because she has two bookcases in the front room and reads
the book-reviews in the Delineator, thinks that she is cultured. When her folks first came
to town they were as poor as Job's turkey, which was not to their discredit--everyone was poor
in those days. The old man Neal was as honest an old Mick as you'd meet in a day's journey,
or at a fair, and he used to run a lemonade and peanut stand down by the bank corner. But his
girls, who were raised on it, until they began teaching school, used to refer to the peanut
stand as 'papa's hobby,' pretend that he only ran it for recreation, and say: 'Now why do you
suppose papa enjoys it?--We just can't get him to give it up!' And now Julia is president of
the Woman's Federation, has stomach trouble, has had two operations, and is suffering untold
agonies with acute culturitis. And yet," Aunt Martha would say through a beatific smile, "she's
a good-enough woman in many ways, and I wouldn't say anything against her for the world."

Once Miss Larrabee, the society editor, brought back this from a visit to Aunt Martha: "I know,
my dear, that your paper says there are no cliques and crowds in society in this town, and
that it is so democratic. But you and I know the truth. We know about society in this town.
We know that if there ever was a town that looked like a side of bacon--streak of lean and
streak of fat all the way down--it is this blessed place. Crowds?--why, I've lived here over
fifty years and it was always crowds. 'Way back in the days when the boys used to pick us up
and carry us across Elm Creek when we went to dances, there were crowds. The girls who crossed
on the boys' backs weren't considered quite proper by the girls who were carried over in the
boys' arms. And they didn't dance in the same set."

Miss Larrabee says she looked into the elder woman's eyes to find which crowd Aunt Martha belonged
to, when she flashed out:

"Oh, child, you needn't look at me--I did both; it depended on who was looking! But, as I was
saying, if anyone knows about society in this town, I do. I went to every dance in town for
the first twenty-five years, and I have made potato salad to pay the salary of every Methodist
preacher for the past thirty years, and I ought to know what I'm talking about." There was
fire enough to twinkle in her old eyes as she spoke. "Beginning at the bottom, one may say
that the base of society is the little tads, ranging down from what your paper calls the Amalgamated
Hand-holders, to the trundle-bed trash just out of their kissing games. It's funny to watch
the little tads grow up and pair off and see how bravely they try to keep in the swim. I've
seen ten grandchildren get out and I've a great-grandchild whose mother will be pushing her
out before she is old enough to know anything. When young people get married they all say they're
not going to be old-marriedy, and they hang on to the dances and little hops until the first
baby comes. Then they don't get out to the dances much, but they join a card club."

In her dissertation on the social progress of young married people, Aunt Martha explained that
after the second year the couple go only to the big dances where everyone is invited, but they
pay more attention to cards. The young mother begins going to afternoon parties, and has the
other young married couples in for dinner. Then, before they know it, they are invited out
to receptions and parties, where little tads preside at the punch-bowls and wait on table,
and are seen and not heard. Aunt Martha continued:

"By the time the second baby comes they take one of two shoots--either go in for church socials
or edge into a whist club. In this town, I think, on the whole, that the Congregational Whist
Club is younger and gayer than the Presbyterian Whist Club, but in most towns the Episcopalians
have the really fashionable club. Of course, these clubs never call themselves by the church
names, but they are generally made up along church lines--except we poor Methodists and Baptists--we
have to divide ourselves out among the others to keep the preacher from going after us."

Aunt Martha's eyes danced with the mischief in her heart as she went on: "Now, if after the
second baby comes, the young parents begin to feel like saving money, and being someone at
the bank, they join the church and go in for church socials, which don't take so much time
or money as the whist clubs and receptions. The babies keep coming and the young people keep
on improving their home, moving from the little house to the big house; the young man's name
begins to creep into lists of directors at the bank, and they are invited out to the big parties,
and she goes to all the stand-up and 'gabble-gobble-and-git' receptions. As they grow older,
they are asked with the preachers and widows for the first night of a series of parties at
a house to get them out of the way and over with before the young folks come later in the week.
When they get to a point where the young folks laugh and clap their hands at little pudgy daddy
when he dances 'Old Dan Tucker' at the big parties in the brick houses, it's all up with them--they
are old married folks, and the next step takes them to the old folks' whist club, where the
bankers' wives and the insurance widows run things. That is the inner sanctuary, the holy of
holies in the society of this town."

After a pause Aunt Martha added: "You'd think, to hear these chosen people talk, that the benighted
souls who go to missionary teas, Woman's Relief Corps chicken-pie suppers, and get up bean-dinners
for the church on election day, live on another planet. Yet I guess we're all made of the same
kind of mud.

"That reminds me of the Winthrops. When they came here, back in the sixties, it happened to
be Fourth of July, and the band was out playing in the grove by the depot. Mrs. Winthrop got
off the train quite grandly and bowed and waved her hand to the band, and the Judge walked
over and gave the band leader five dollars. They said afterward that they felt deeply touched
to find a raw Western town so appreciative of the coming of an old New England family, that
it greeted them with a band. Before Mrs. Winthrop had been here three weeks she called on me,
'as one of the first ladies of the town,' she said, to organise and see if we couldn't break
up the habit of the hired girls eating at the table with the family." Aunt Martha smiled and
her eyes glittered as she added: "After they organised, the titled aristocracy of this town
did their own work and sent the washing out for a year or more."

The talk drifted back to the old days, and Aunt Martha got out her photograph-album and showed
Miss Larrabee the pictures of those whom she called "the rude forefathers of the village,"
in their quaint old costumes of war-times. In the book were baby pictures of middle-aged men
and women, and youthful pictures of the old men and women of the town. But most interesting
of all to Miss Larrabee were the daguerreotypes--quaint old portraits in their little black
boxes, framed in plush and gilt. The old woman brought out picture after picture--her husband's
among the others, in a broad beaver hat with a high choker taken back in Brattleboro before
he came to Kansas. She looked at it for a long minute, and then said gaily to Miss Larrabee:
"He was a handsome boy--quite the beau of the State when we were married--Judge of the District
Court at twenty-four." She held the case in her hand and went on opening the others. She came
to one showing a moustached and goateed youth in a captain's uniform--a slim, straight, soldierly
figure. As she passed it to Miss Larrabee Aunt Martha looked sidewise at her, saying: "You
wouldn't know him now. Yet you see him every day, I suppose." After the girl shook her head,
the elder woman continued: "Well, that's Jim Purdy, taken the day he left for the army." She
sighed as she said: "Let me see, I guess I haven't happened to run across Jim for ten years
or more, but he didn't look much like this then. Poor old Jim, they tell me he's not having
the best time in the world. Someway, all the old-timers that are living seem to be hard up,
or in bad health, or unhappy. It doesn't seem right, after what they've done and what they've
gone through. But I guess it's the way of life. It's the way life gets even with us for letting
us outlive the others. Compensation--as Emerson says."

Miss Larrabee came down the lilac-bordered walk from the stately old brick house, carrying
a great bouquet of sweet peas and nasturtiums and poppies and phlox, a fleeting memory of some
association she had in her mind of Uncle Jimmy Purdy and Aunt Martha kept tantalising her.
She could not get it out of the background of her consciousness, and yet it refused to form
itself into a tangible conception. It was associated vaguely with her own grandmother, as though,
infinite ages ago, her grandmother had said something that had lodged the idea in the girl's head.

When the occasion made itself, Miss Larrabee asked her grandmother the question that puzzled
her, and learned that Martha Perkins and Jim Purdy were lovers before the war, and that she
was wearing his ring when he went away--thinking he would be back in a few weeks with the Rebellion
put down. In his first fight he was shot in the head and was in the hospital for a year, demented;
when he was put back in the ranks he was captured and his name given out among the killed.
In prison his dementia returned and he stayed there two years. Then for a year after his exchange
he followed the Union Army like a dumb creature, and not until two years after the close of
the war did the poor fellow drift home again, as one from the dead--all uncertain of the past
and unfitted for the future.

And his sweetheart drank her cup alone. The old settlers say that she never flinched nor shrank,
but for years, even after her marriage to the Judge, the young woman kept a little grave covered
with flowers, that bore the simple words: "Martha, aged five months and three days." They say
that she did not lose her courage and that she bent her head for no one. But the war brought
her neighbours so many sorrows that Martha's trouble was forgotten, the years passed and only
the old people of the community know about the little grave beside the Judge's and their little
boy's. Jimmy Purdy grew into a smooth-faced, unwrinkled, rather blank-eyed old man, clerking
in the bookstore for a time, serving as City Clerk for twenty years, and later living at the
Palace Hotel on his pension. He worshipped Aunt Martha's children and her children's children,
but he never saw her except when they met in some casual way. She was married when he came
back from the war, and if he ever knew her agony he never spoke of it. Whenever he talked of
the events before the war, his face wore a troubled, baffled look, and he did not seem to remember
things clearly. He was a simple old man with a boyish face and heart who was confused by the
world growing old around him.

One day they found him dead in his bed. And Miss Larrabee hurried out to Aunt Martha's to get
the facts about his life for the paper. It was a bright October morning as she went up the
walk to the old brick house, and she heard someone playing on the piano, rolling the chords
after the grandiose manner of pianists fifty years ago. A voice seemed to be singing an old
ballad. As the girl mounted the steps the voice came more distinctly to her.

Suddenly the voice choked in a groan. As she stood by the open door Miss Larrabee could see
in the darkened room the figure of an old woman racked with sobs on a great mahogany sofa,
and on the floor beside her lay a daguerreotype, glinting its gilt and glass through the gloom.

The girl tiptoed across the porch, down the steps through the garden and out of the gate.

IX

Our Loathed but Esteemed Contemporary

No one remembers a time when there were not two newspapers in our town--generally quarrelling
with each other. Though musicians and doctors and barbers are always jealous of their business
rivals, and though they show their envy more or less to their discredit, editors are so jealous
of one another, and so shameless about it, that the profession has been made a joke. Certainly
in our town there is a deep-seated belief that if one paper takes one side of any question,
even so fair a proposition as street-paving, the other will take the opposing side.

Of course, our paper has not been contrary; but we have noticed a good many times--every one
in the office has noticed it, the boys and girls in the back-office, and the boys and girls
in the front-office--that whenever we take a stand for anything, say for closing the stores
at six o'clock, the General swings the Statesman into line against it. If he has done it once
he has done it fifty times in the last ten years; and, though we have often felt impelled to
oppose some of the schemes which he has brought forward, it has been because they were bad
for the town, and perhaps because, even though they did seem plausible, we knew that the unscrupulous
gang that was behind these schemes would in some way turn them into a money-making plot to
rob the people. We never could see that justification in the Statesman's position. To us it
seemed merely pigheadedness. But the passing years are teaching us to appreciate the General
better, and each added year is seeming to make us more tolerant of his shortcomings.

Counting in the three years he was in the army, he has been running the Statesman for forty-five
years, and for thirty-five years he was master of the field. For thirty years this town was
known as General A. Jackson Durham's town. He ran the county Republican conventions, and controlled
the five counties next to ours, so that, though he could never go to Congress himself, on account
of his accumulation of enemies, he always named the successful candidate from the district,
and for a generation held undisturbed the selection of post-masters within his sphere of influence.
In State politics he was more powerful than any Congressman he ever made. Often he came down
to the State Convention with blood in his eye after the political scalp of some politician
who had displeased him, and the fight he made and the disturbance he started, gave him the
name of Old Bull Durham. On such occasions, he would throw back his head, shut his eyes and
roar his wrath at his opponents in a most disquieting manner, and when he returned home, whether
he had won or lost his fight, his paper would bristle for two or three weeks with rage, and
his editorial page would be full of lurid articles written in short exclamatory sentences,
pocked with italics, capital letters and black-faced lines.

For General A. Jackson Durham was a fire-eater and was proud of it. He advertised the fact
that he was a good hater by showing his barrel to callers at his office. In that barrel he
had filed away every disreputable thing that he had been able to find against friend or foe,
far or near, and when the friend became a foe, or the foe became troublesome, the General opened
his barrel. He kept also an office blacklist, on which were written the names of the men in
town that were never to be printed in the Statesman. When we established our little handbill
of a newspaper, he made all manner of fun of our "dish-rag," as he called it, and insisted
on writing so much about our paper that people read it to see what we had to say. Other papers
had made the mistake of replying to the General in kind, and people had soon tired of the quarrel
and dropped the new quarrelling paper for the old one. The State never had seen the General's
equal as a wrangler; but we did not fight back, and there was only a one-sided quarrel for
the people to tire of. We grew and got a foothold in the town, but the General never admitted
it. He does not admit it now, though his paper has been cut down time and again, and is no
larger than our little dish-rag was in the beginning. But he still maintains his old assumption
of the power that departed years ago. He walked proudly out of the County Convention the day
that it rode over him, and he still begins the names of the new party leaders in the county
in small letters to show his contempt for them.

The day of his downfall in the County Convention marked the beginning of his decline in State
politics. When it was known that his county was against him, people ceased to fear him and
in time new leaders came in the State whom he did not know even by sight; but the General did
not recognise them as leaders. To him they were interlopers. He sent his paper regularly to
the old leaders, who had been shoved aside as he had been, and wrote letters to them urging
them to arouse the people to throw off the chains of bossdom. Five years ago he and a number
of lonesome and forgotten ones, who formerly ruled the State with an iron hand, and whose arrogance
had cost the party a humiliating defeat, organised the "Anti-Boss League," and held semi-annual
conventions at the capital. They made long speeches and issued long proclamations, and called
vehemently upon the people to rend their chains, but some way the people didn't heed the call,
and the General and his boss-busters, as they were called, began to have hard work getting
their "calls" and "proclamations" and "addresses" into the city papers. The reporters referred
to them as the Ancient Order of Has-Beens, and wounded the General's pride by calling him Past
Master of the Grand Lodge of Hons. He came home from the meeting of the boss-busters at which
this insult had been heaped upon him and bellowed like a mad bull for six months, using so
much space in his paper that there was no room at all for local news.

In the General's idea of what a newspaper should contain; news does not come first, and he
does not mind crowding it out. He believes that a newspaper should stand for "principles."
The Statesman was started during the progress of the Civil War, when issues were news, and
the General has never been able to realize that in times of peace people buy a newspaper for
its news and not for its opinions. He never could understand our attitude toward what he called
"principles." When the town was for free silver, we were for the gold standard, and we never
exerted ourselves particularly for a high tariff, and when the General saw our paper grow in
spite of its heresies, he was amazed, and expressed his amazement in columns of vitriolic anger.
Because we often ignored "issues" and "principles" and "great basic and fundamental ideas,"
as he called his contentions on the silver and tariff questions, for lists of delegates at
conventions, names of pupils at the county institute, and winners of prizes at the fair, he
was filled with alarm for the future of the noble calling of journalism.

Long ago we quit making fun of him. One day we wrote an article referring to him as "the old
man," and it was gossiped among the printers that he was cut to the heart. He did not reply
to that, and although a few days later he referred to us as thieves and villains, we never
had the heart to tease him again, and now every one around the office has instructions to put
"General" before his name whenever it is used. Probably this cheers him up. At least it should
do so, for in spite of his pride and his much advertised undying wrath, he is in truth a tender-hearted
old man, and has never been disloyal to the town. It is the apple of his eye. His fierceness
has always been more for publication than as an evidence of good faith. He likes to think that
he is unforgiving and relentless, but he has a woman's heart. He fought the renomination of
Grant for a third term most bitterly, but when the old commander died, the boys in the Statesman
office say that Durham sniffled gently while he wrote the obituary, and when he closed with
the words "Poor Grant," he laid his head on the table and his frame shook in real sorrow.

Most of the subscribers have left his paper, and few of the advertisers use it, but what seems
to hurt him worst is his feeling that the town has gone back on him. He has given all of his
life to this town; he has spent thousands of dollars to promote its growth; he has watched
every house on the town-site rise, and has made an item in his paper about it; he has written
up the weddings of many of the grandmothers and grandfathers of the town; he has chronicled
the birth of their children and children's children. The old scrapbooks are filled with kind
things that the General has written. Old men and old women scan these wrinkled pages with eyes
that have lost their lustre, and on the rusty clippings pasted there fall many tears. In this
book many a woman reads the little verse below the name of a child whom only she and God remember.
In some other scrapbook a man, long since out of the current of life, reads the story of his
little triumph in the world; in the family Bible is a clipping from the Statesman--yellow and
crisp with years--that tells of a daughter's wedding and the social glory that descended upon
the house for that one great day. So, as the General goes about the streets of the town, in
his shiny long frock-coat and his faded campaign hat, men do not laugh at him, nor do they
hate him. He is the old buffalo, horned out of the herd.

The profession of newspaper making is a young man's profession. The time will come when over
at our office there will be a shrinkage. Even now our leading citizens never go away from town
and talk to other newspaper men that they do not say that if someone would come over here and
start a bright, spicy newspaper he could drive us out of town and make money. The best friends
we have, when they talk to newspaper men in other towns are not above saying that our paper
is so generally hated that it would be no trouble to put it out of business. That is what people
said of the General in the eighties. They do not say it now.

For the fight is over with him. And he is walking on an old battlefield, reviewing old victories,
not knowing that another contest is waging further on. Sometimes the boys in the Statesman
office get their money Saturday night, and sometimes they do not. If they do not, the General
grandly issues "orders" on the grocery stores. Then he takes his pen in hand and writes a stirring
editorial on the battle of Cold Harbor, and closes by enquiring whether the country is going
to forget the grand principles that inspired men in those trying days.

In the days when the Statesman was a power in the land, editorials like this were widely quoted.
He was department commander of the G. A. R. at a time when such a personage was as important
in our State as the Governor. The General's editorials on pensions were read before the Pensions
Committee in Congress and had much weight there, and even in the White House the General's
attitude was reckoned with. When he rallied the old soldiers to any cause the earth trembled,
but now the General's editorials pass unheeded. When he calls to "the men who defended this
country in one great crisis to rise and rescue her again," he does not understand that he is
speaking to a world of ghosts, and that his "clarion note" falls on empty air. The old boys
whom he would arouse are sleeping; only he and a little handful survive. Yet to him they still
live; to him their power is still invincible--if they would but rally to the old call. He believes
that some day they will rally, and that the world, which is now going sadly wrong, will be
set right. With his hands clasped behind him, looking through his steel-rimmed glasses, from
under his shaggy brows, he walks through a mad world, waiting for it to return to reason. In
his fiery black eyes one may see a puzzled look as he views the bewildering show. He is confused,
but defiant. His head is still high; he has no thought of surrender. So, day after day, he
riddles the bedlam about him with his broadsides, in the hourly hope of victory.

It was only last week that the General was in Jim Bolton's livery stable office asking Jim
if he had any old ledgers, that the Statesman office might have. He explained that he tore
off their covers, cut them up and used the unspoiled sheets for copy-paper. In Bolton's office
he met a farmer from the Folcraft neighbourhood in the southern end of the county, who hadn't
seen the General for half-a-dozen years. "Why--hello General," exclaimed the farmer with unconcealed
surprise, as though addressing one risen from the dead. "You still around here? What are you
doing now?" The old man tucked the ledger under his arm, straightened up with great dignity,
and tried not to wince under the blow. He put one hand in his shiny, frayed, greenish-black
frock-coat, and replied with quiet dignity, "I am following my profession, sir--that of a journalist."
And after fixing the farmer with his piercing black eyes for a moment, the General turned away
and was gone.

When we do something to displease him, he turns all his guns on us, though probably his foreman
has to borrow paper from our office to get the Statesman out. The General regards us as his
natural prey and his foreman regards our paper stock as his natural forage--but they use so
little that we do not mind.

Once a new bookkeeper in our office saw the General's old account for paper. She sent the General
a statement, and another, and in the third she put the words: "Please remit." The day after
he had received the insult the General stalked grandly into the office with the amount of money
required by the bookkeeper. He put it down without a word and walked over to the desk where
the proprietor was working.

"Young man," said the General, as he rapped with his cane on the desk. "I was talking to-day
with a gentleman from Norwalk, Ohio, who knew your father. Yes, sir; he knew your father, and
speaks highly of him, sir. I am surprised to hear, sir, that your father was a perfect gentleman,
sir. Good-morning, sir."

And with that the General moved majestically out of the office.

X

A Question of Climate

Colonel Morrison had three initials, so the town naturally called him "Alphabetical" Morrison,
and dropped the "Colonel." He came to our part of the country in an early day--he used to explain
that they caught him in the trees, when he was drinking creek water, eating sheep-sorrel, and
running wild with a buffalo tail for a trolley, and that the first thing they did, after teaching
him to eat out of a plate, was to set him at work in the grading gang that was laying out the
Cottonwood and Walnut Rivers and putting the limestone in the hills. He was one of the original
five patriots who laid out the Corn Belt Railroad from the Mississippi to the Pacific, and
was appointed one of that committee to take the matter to New York for the inspection of capitalists--and
be it said to the credit of Alphabetical Morrison that he was the only person in the crowd
with money enough to pay the ferryman when he reached the Missouri River, though he had only
enough to get himself across. But in spite of that the road was built, and though it missed
our town, it was because we didn't vote the bonds, though old Alphabetical went through the
county, roaring in the schoolhouses, bellowing at the crossroads, and doing all that a good,
honest pair of lungs could do for the cause. However, he was not dismayed at his failure, and
began immediately to organise a company to build another road. We finally secured a railroad,
though it was only a branch.

Over his office door he had a sign--"Land Office"--painted on the false board front of the
building in letters as big as a cow, and the first our newspaper knew of him was twenty years
ago, when he brought in an order for some stationery for the Commercial Club. At that time
we had not heard that the town supported a Commercial Club--nor had anyone else heard of it,
for that matter--for old Alphabetical was the president, and his bookkeeper, with the Miss
dropped off her name, was secretary. But he had a wonderfully alluring letterhead printed,
and seemed to get results, for he made a living while his competitors starved. Later, when
he found time, he organised a real Commercial Club, and had himself elected president of it.
He used to call meetings of the club to discuss things, but as no one cared much for his monologues
on the future of the town, the attendance was often light. He issued circulars referring to
our village as "the Queen City of the Prairies," and on the circulars was a map, showing that
the Queen City of the Prairies was "the railroad axis of the West." There was one road running
into the town; the others old Alphabetical indicated with dotted lines, and explained in a
foot-note that they were in process of construction.

He became possessed of a theory that a canning factory would pay in the Queen City of the Prairies,
and the first step he took toward building it was to invest in a high hat, a long coat and
white vest, and a pair of mouse-coloured trousers. With these and his theory he went East and
returned with a condition. The canning factory went up, but the railroad rates went wrong,
and the factory was never opened. Alphabetical blinked at it through his gold-rimmed glasses
for a few weeks, and then organised a company to turn it into a woollen mill. He elected himself
president of that company and used to bring around to our paper, notices of directors' meetings,
and while he was in the office he would insist that we devoted too much space to idle gossip
and not enough to the commercial and industrial interests of the Queen City.

At times he would bring in an editorial that he had written himself, highly excitable and full
of cyclonic language, and if we printed it Alphabetical would buy a hundred copies of the paper
containing it and send them East. His office desk gradually filled with woodcuts and zinc etchings
of buildings that never existed save in his own dear old head, and about twice a year during
the boom days he would bring them around and have a circular printed on which were the pictures
showing the imaginary public buildings and theoretical business thoroughfares of the Queen City.

The woollen mill naturally didn't pay, and he persuaded some Eastern capitalists to install
an electric plant in the building and put a streetcar line in the town, though the longest
distance from one side of the place to the other was less than ten blocks. But Alphabetical
was enthusiastic about it, and had the Governor come down to drive the first spike. It was
gold-plated, and Alphabetical pulled it up and used it for a paper-weight in his office for
many years, and it is now the only reminder there is in town of the street railway, except
a hard ridge of earth over the ties in the middle of Main Street. When someone twitted him
on the failure of the street railway he made answer:

"Of course it failed; here I go pawing up the earth, milking out the surplus capital of the
effete East, and building up this town--and what happens? Four thousand old silurian fossils
comb the moss on the north side of 'em, with mussel shell, and turn over and yawp that old
Alphabetical is visionary. Here I get a canning factory and nobody eats the goods; I hustle
up a woollen factory, and the community quits wearing trousers; I build for them a streetcar
line to haul them to and from their palatial residences, and what do the sun-baked human mud
turtles do but all jump off the log into the water and hide from them cars like they were chariots
of fire? What this town needs is not factories, nor railroads, nor modern improvements--Old
Alphabetical can get them--but the next great scheme I go into is to go down to the river,
get some good red mud, and make a few thousand men who will build up a town."

It has been fifteen years and over since Colonel Morrison put on his long coat and high hat
and started for the money markets of the East, seeking whom he might devour. At the close of
the eighties the Colonel and all his tribe found that the stock of Eastern capitalists who
were ready to pay good prices for the fine shimmering blue sky and bracing ozone of the West
was running low. It was said in town that the Colonel had come to the end of his string, for
not only were the doors of capital closed to him in the East, but newcomers had stopped looking
for farms at home. There was nothing to do but to sit down and swap jack-knives with other
land agents, and as they had taken most of the agencies for the best insurance companies while
the Colonel was on dress parade, there was nothing left for him to do but to run for justice
of the peace, and, being elected, do what he could to make his tenure for life.

Though he was elected, more out of gratitude for what he had tried to do for the town than
because people thought he would make a fair judge, he got no further than his office in popular
esteem. He did not seem to wear well with the people in the daily run and jostle of life. During
the forty years he has been in our town, he has lived most of the time apart from the people--transacting
his business in the East, or locating strangers on new lands. He has not been one of us, and
there were stories afloat that his shrewdness had sometimes caused him to thrust a toe over
the dead-line of exact honesty. In the town he never helped us to fight for those things of
which the town is really proud: our schools, the college, the municipal ownership of electric
lights and waterworks, the public library, the abolition of the saloon, and all of the dozen
small matters of public interest in which good citizens take a pride. Colonel Morrison was
living his grand life, in his tailor-made clothes, while his townsmen were out with their coats
off making our town the substantial place it is. So in his latter days he is old Alphabetical
Morrison, a man apart from us. We like him well enough, and so long as he cares to be justice
of the peace no one will object, for that is his due. But, someway, there is no talk of making
him County Clerk; and there is a reason in everyone's mind why no party names him to run for
County Treasurer. He has been trying hard enough for ten years to break through the crust of
the common interests that he has so long ignored. One sees him at public meetings--a rather
wistful-looking, chubby-faced old man--on the edge of the crowd, ready to be called out for
a speech. But no one calls his name; no one cares particularly what old Alphabetical has to
say. Long ago he said all that he can say to our people.

The only thing that Alphabetical ever organised that paid was a family. In the early days he
managed to get a home clear of indebtedness and was shrewd enough to keep it out of all of
his transactions. Tow-headed Morrisons filled the schoolhouse, and twenty years later there
were so many of his girls teaching school that the school-board had to make a ruling limiting
the number of teachers from one family in the city school, in order to force the younger Morrison
girls to go to the country to teach. In these days the girls keep the house going and Alphabetical
is a notary public and a justice of the peace, which keeps his office going in the little square
board building at the end of the street. But every day for the past ten years he has been coming
to our office for his bundle of old newspapers. These he reads carefully, and sometimes what
he reads inspires him to write something for our paper on the future of the Queen City, though
much oftener his articles are retrospective. He is the president of the Old Settlers' Society,
and once or twice a year he brings in an obituary which he has written for the family of some
of the old-timers.

One would think that an idler would be a nuisance in a busy place, but, on the contrary, we
all like old Alphabetical around our office. For he is an old man who has not grown sour. His
smooth, fat face has not been wrinkled by the vinegar of failure, and the noise that came from
his lusty lungs in the old days is subsiding. But he has never forgiven General Durham, of
the Statesman, for saying of a fight between Alphabetical and another land agent back in the
sixties that "those who heard it pronounced it the most vocal engagement they had ever known."
That is why he brings his obituaries to us; that is why he does us the honour of borrowing
papers from us; and that is why, on a dull afternoon, he likes to sit in the old sway-back
swivel-chair and tell us his theory of the increase in the rainfall, his notion about the influence
of trees upon the hot winds, his opinion of the disappearance of the grasshoppers. Also, that
is why we always save a circus-ticket for old Alphabetical, just as we save one for each of
the boys in the office.

One day he came into the office in a bad humour. He picked up a country paper, glanced it over,
threw it down, kicked from under his feet a dog that had followed a subscriber into the room,
and slammed his hat into the waste-basket with considerable feeling as he picked up a New York
paper.

"Well--well, what's the matter with the judiciary this morning?" someone asked the old man.

He did not reply at once, but turned his paper over and over, apparently looking for something
to interest him. Gradually the revolutions of his paper became slower and slower, and finally
he stopped turning the paper and began reading. It was ten or fifteen minutes before he spoke.
When he put down the paper his cherubic face was beaming, and he said:

"Oh--I know I'm a fool, but I wish the Lord had sent me to live in a town large enough so that
every dirty-faced brat on the street wouldn't feel he had a right to call me 'Alphabetical'!
Dammit, I've done the best I could! I haven't made any alarming success. I know it. There's
no need of rubbing it in on me."--He was silent for a time with his hands on his knees and
his head thrown back looking at the ceiling. Almost imperceptibly a smile began to crack his
features, and, when he turned his eyes to the man at the desk, they were dancing with merriment,
as he said: "Just been reading a piece here in the Sun about the influence of climate on human
endeavour. It says that in northern latitudes there is more oxygen in the air and folks breathe
faster, and their blood flows faster, and that keeps their livers going. Trouble with me has
always been climate--sluggish liver. If I had had just a little more oxygen floating round
in my system, the woollen mill would still be running, the street-cars would be going, and
this town would have had forty thousand inhabitants. My fatal mistake was one of latitude.
But"--and he drawled out the word mockingly--"but I guess if the Lord had wanted me to make
a town here he would have given me a different kind of liver!" He slapped his knees as he sighed:
"This is a funny world, and the more you see of it the funnier it gets." The old man grinned
complacently at the ceiling for a minute, and before getting out of his chair kicked his shoe-heels
together merrily, wiped his glasses as he rose, put his bundle of papers under his arm, and
left the office whistling an old, old-fashioned tune.

XI

The Casting Out of Jimmy Myers

It seemed a cruel thing to do, but we had to do it. For ours is ordinarily a quiet office.
We have never had a libel suit. We have had fewer fights than most newspaper offices have,
and while it hardly may be said that we strive to please, still in the main we try to get on
with the people, and tell them as much truth as they are entitled to for ten cents a week.
Naturally, we do our best to get up a sprightly paper, and in that the Myers boy had our idea
exactly. He was industrious; more than that, he tried with all his might to exercise his best
judgment, and no one could say that he was careless; yet everyone around the office admitted
that he was unlucky. He was one of those persons who always have slivers on their doors, or
tar on the knocker, when opportunity comes their way; so his stay in the office was marked
by a series of seismic disturbances in the paper that came from under his desk, and yet he
was in no way to blame for them.

We took him from the college at the edge of town. He had been running the college paper for
a year, and knew the merchants around town fairly well; and, since he was equipped as far as
education went, he seemed to be a likely sort of a boy for reporter and advertising solicitor.

One of the first things that happened to him was a mistake in an item about the opera house.
He said that a syndicate had taken a lien on it. What he meant was a lease, and as he got the
item from a man who didn't know the difference, and as the boy stuck to it that the man had
said lien and not lease, we did not charge that up to him. A few days later he wrote for a
town photographer a paid local criticising someone who was going around the county peddling
picture-frames and taking orders for enlarged pictures. That was not so bad, but it turned
out that the pedlar was a woman, and she came with a rawhide and camped in the office for two
days waiting for Jimmy, while he came in and out of the back door, stuck his copy on the hook
by stealth, and travelled only in the alleys to get his news. One could hardly say that he
was to blame for that, either, as the photographer who paid for the item didn't say the pedlar
was a woman, and the boy was no clairvoyant.

One dull day he wrote a piece about the gang who played poker at night in Red Martin's room.
Jimmy said he wasn't afraid of Red, and he wasn't. The item was popular enough, and led to
a raid on the place, which disclosed our best advertiser sitting in the game. To suppress his
name meant our shame before the town; to print it meant his--at our expense. It was embarrassing,
but it wasn't exactly the boy's fault. It was just one of those unfortunate circumstances that
come up in life. However, the advertiser aforesaid began to hate the boy.

He must have been used to injustice all his life, for there was a vertical line between his
eyes that marked trouble. The line deepened as he went further and further into the newspaper
business; for, generally speaking, a person who is unlucky has less to fear handling dynamite
than he has writing local items on a country paper.

A few days after the raid on the poker-room Jimmy, who had acquired a particularly legible
hand, wrote: "The hem of her skirt was trimmed with pink crushed roses," and he was in no way
to blame for the fact that the printer accidentally put an "h" for a "k" in skirt, though the
woman's husband chased Jimmy into a culvert under Main Street and kept him there most of the
forenoon, while the cheering crowd informed the injured husband whenever Jimmy tried to get
out of either end of his prison.

The printer that made the mistake bought Jimmy a new suit of clothes, we managed to print an
apology that cooled the husband's wrath, and for ten days, or perhaps two weeks, the boy's
life was one round of joy. Everything was done promptly, accurately and with remarkable intelligence.
He whistled at his work and stacked up more copy than the printers could set up in type. No
man ever got in or out of town without having his name in our paper. Jimmy wrote up a railroad
bond election meeting so fairly that he pleased both sides, and reported a murder trial so
well that the lawyers for each side kept the boy's pockets full of ten-cent cigars. The vertical
wrinkle was fading from his forehead, when one fine summer morning he brought in a paid item
from a hardware merchant, and went blithely out to write up the funeral of the wife of a prominent
citizen. He was so cheerful that day that it bothered him.

He told us in confidence that he never felt festive and gay that something didn't happen. He
was not in the building that evening when the paper went to press, but after it was printed
and the carriers had left the office he came in, singing "She's My Sweetheart, I'm Her Beau,"
and sat down to read the paper.

Suddenly the smile on his face withered as with frost, and he handed the paper across the table
to the bookkeeper, who read this item:

     DIED--MRS. LILLIAN GILSEY.

     Prepare for the hot weather, my good woman. There is only one way
     now; get a gasoline stove, of Hurley & Co., and you need not fear
     any future heat.

And it wasn't Jimmy's fault. The foreman had merely misplaced a head line, but that explanation
did not satisfy the bereaved family.

Jimmy was beginning to acquire a reputation as a joker. People refused to believe that such
things just happened. They did not happen before Mr. James Myers came to the paper--why should
they begin with his coming and continue during his engagement? Thus reasoned the comforters
of the Gilseys, and those interested in our downfall. The next day the Statesman wrote a burning
editorial denouncing us "for an utter lack of all sense of common decency" that permitted us
"to violate the sacredest feeling known to the human heart for the sake of getting a ribald
laugh from the unthinking." We were two weeks explaining that the error was not the boy's fault.
People assumed that the mistake could not have occurred in any well-regulated printing office,
and it didn't seem probable that it could occur--yet there it was. But Jimmy wasn't to blame.
He suffered more than we did--more than the bereaved family did. He went unshaven and forgot
to trim his cuffs or turn his collar. He hated to go on the streets for news, and covered with
the office telephone as much of his beat as possible.

The summer wore away and the dog days came. The Democratic State campaign was about to open
in our town, and orators and statesmen assembled from all over the Missouri valley. There was
a lack of flags at the dry-goods stores. The Fourth of July celebration had taken all the stock.
The only materials available were some red bunting, some white bunting, and some blue bunting
with stars dotted upon it. With this bunting the Committee on Reception covered the speakers'
stand, wrapping the canopy under which the orators stood in the solid colours and the star-spangled
blue. It was beautiful to see, and the pride of the window-dresser of the Golden Eagle Clothing
Store. But the old soldiers who walked by nudged one another and smiled.

About noon of the day of the speaking the City Clerk, who wore the little bronze button of
the G. A. R., asked Jimmy if he didn't want someone to take care of the Democratic meeting.
Jimmy, who hated politics, was running his legs off to get the names of the visitors, and was
glad to have the help. He turned in the contributed copy without reading it, as he had done
with the City Clerk's articles many times before, and this is what greeted his horrified eyes
when he read the paper:

               "UNDER THE STARS & BARS" 

    One day when us wanted to play in de stable, us
                 turned Old Camel( dat
                   was de bull) out in de
    pasture. He tuk down rails enough wid his horns to let de cows in
Marster' s fine gyarden and dey et it all up.

Marster was wuss dan mad dat time, but us hid in de barn under some
hay' til he went to bed.

Next mornin' he called us all up to git our whuppin', but us cried and said us wouldn'
t never do it no more so our good old Marster let us off dat time."

Lak I done said before, I stayed on dar' til Marster died, den I married Matthew
Hartsfield. Lordy, Chile, us didn' t have no weddin'. I had on a new calico
dress and Matthew wore some new blue jeans breeches.

De Reverend Hargrove, de white folks preacher, married us and nobody didn' t know nothin'' bout it' til
it was all over. Us went to Oglethorpe County and lived dar 19 years' fore Matthew died. I wuked wid
white folks dar' til I married up wid Ben Larken and us come on here
to Athens to live.

I have done some wuk for' most all de white folks' round here. Ben'
s grandpappy was a miller on Potts Creek, nigh Stephens, and sometimes Ben
used to have to go help him out wid de wuk, atter he got old and
feeble."

Dey' s all gone now and' cept for some nieces, I' m left all alone. I kin still mind de chillun
and even a little wuk. For dat I do give thanks to de Good Lord-- dat he keeps me able to
do some wuk."

Goodbye Chile," said Julia, when her visitor arose to leave."

You must be more keerful' bout walkin'' round when de sun is too
hot. It' ll make you sick sho'.

    Folks jus' don' t know how to take de
      right sort of keer of deyselves
    dese days."[ HW: Dist.
      

5 Ex- Slave# 67 E. F. Driskell 12/ 31/ 36][ HW: GEORGE LEWIS][ Date
Stamp: MAY 2---] Mr. George Lewis was born in Pensacola, Florida December
17, 1849.

In addition to himself and his parents, Sophie and Charles Lewis,
there were thirteen other children; two of whom were girls.

Mr. Lewis( Geo.) was the third eldest child.

Although married Mr. Lewis' parents belonged to different owners. However, Dr. Brosenhan often allowed
his servant to visit his wife it on the plantation of her owner,
Mrs. Caroline Bright.

In regard to work all of the members of the Lewis clan fared very
well.

The father, who belonged to Dr. Brosenhan, was a skilled shipbuilder and he was permitted to
hire himself out to those needing his services.

He was also allowed to hire[ HW: out] those children belonging to him who were old enough to work.
He was only required to pay his master and the mistress of his children
a certain percent of his earnings.

On the Bright plantation Mrs blue head collards, cabbages, peas,
and' taters by de wholesale for de slaves to eat and, onct a week,.
Lewis served as maid and as part of her duties she had to help with
the cooking.

Mr. Lewis and his brothers and sisters were never required to do very much work. Most of their time
was spent in playing around in the yard of the big house. In answer to a query concerning the
work requirements of the other slaves on this particular plantation
Mr. Lewis replied" De sun would never ketch dem at de house.

By de
time it wus up dey had done got to de fiel'-- not jes gwine.

I' ve known men to have to wait till it wus bright enough to see how
to plow without" kivering" the plants up. Dey lef' so early in de mornings
dat breakfus' had to be sent to dem in de fiel'.

De chillun was de ones who carried de meals dere. Dis was de first job dat I
had. All de pails wus put on a long stick an' somebody hold to each end
of de stick.

If de fiel' hands was too far away fum de house at dinner time it
was sent to dem de same as de breakfus'".

All of the slaves on the plantation were awakened each morning by a bugle or a horn which was blown
by the overseer. The same overseer gave the signal for dinner hour by blowing on the same horn.
All were usually given one hour for dinner.

None
had to do any work after leaving the fields unless happened to be personal
work. No work other than the caring for the stock was required on
Sundays.

A few years before the Civil War Mrs. Bright married a Dr. Bennett Ferrel and moved to his home
in Georgia( Troupe County). Mr. Lewis states that he and his fellow slaves always had" pretty fair"
food.

Before they moved to Georgia the rations were issued daily and for the most
part an issue consisted of vegetables, rice, beans, meat( pork) all
kinds of fish and grits, etc."

We got good clothes too says Mr. Lewis. All of' em was bought. All de chillun
wore a long shirt until dey wus too big an' den dey was given pants an'
dresses. De shoes wus made out of red leather an' wus called brogans.
After we moved to Georgia our new marster bought de cloth an' had
all de clothes made on de plantation.

De food wus" pretty fair" here too.
We got corn bread an' biscuit sometimes-- an' it was sometimes too--
bacon, milk, all kinds of vegetables an' sicha stuff like dat.

De flour dat we made de
biscuits out of was de third grade shorts." The food on Sunday was almost
identical with that eaten during the week. However, those who desired
to were allowed to hunt as much as they pleased to at night.

They
were not permitted to carry guns and so when the game was treed the tree had
to be cut down in order to get it. It was in this way that the family
larder was increased." All in all", says Mr. Lewis," we got everything
we wanted excep' dere wus no money comin' for our work an' we couldn' t
go off de place unless we asked.

If you wus caught off your plantation without a permit fum marster
de Paddy- Rollers whupped you an' sent you home."

The slaves living
quarters were located in the rear of the" big house"( this was true
of the plantation located in Pensacola as well as the one in Georgia).
All were made of logs and, according to Mr. Lewis, all were substantially
built.

Wooden pegs were used in the place of nails and the cracks left in
the walls were sealed with mud and sticks.

These cabins were very comfortable and only one family was allowed to a cabin.
All floors were of wood. The only furnishings were the beds and one or two benches
or bales which served as chairs. In some respects these beds resembled
a scaffold nailed to the side of a house.

Others were made of heavy wood and had four legs to stand upon. For the most part, however, one end of
the bed was nailed to the wall.

The mattresses were made out of any kind of material that a slave could secure,
burlap sacks, ausenberg, etc. After a large bag had been made with
this material it was stuffed with straw.

Heavy cord running from side to side was used for the bed springs. The end of the cord was tied to
a handle at the end of the bed.

This pemitted the occupant to tighten the cord when it became loosened.
A few cooking utensils completed the furnishings.

All illumination was secured by means of the door and the open fire place. All of the slaves on the
plantation were permitted to" frolic" whenever they wanted to and
for as long a time as they wanted to.

The master gave them all of the whiskey that they desired.

One
of the main day for a frolic was during a corn shucking. At each frolic
there was dancing, fiddling, and eating. The next morning, however
all had to be prepared to report as usual to the fields. All were
required to attend church each Sunday.

The same church was used by the slave owners and their slaves.

The owners attended church in the morning at eleven o' clock and
the slaves attended at three o' clock.

A white
minister did all of the preaching." De bigges' sermon he preached",
says Mr. Lewis," was to read de Bible an' den tell us to be smart
an' not to steal chickens, eggs, an' butter, fum our marsters."

All
baptising was done by this selfsame minister. When a couple wished
to marry the man secured the permission of his intended wife' s owner
and if he consented, a broom was placed on the floor and the couple
jumped over it and were then pronounced man and wife.

There was not a great deal of whipping on the plantation of Dr. Ferrel
but at such times all whippings were administered by one of the overseers
employed on the plantation.

Mr. Lewis himself was only whipped once and then by the Doctor.

This was
just a few days before the slaves were freed. Mr. Lewis says that the
doctor came to the field one morning and called him. He told him that they
were going to be freed but that before he did free him he was going
to let him see what it was like to be whipped by a white man, and
he proceeded to paddle him with a white oak paddle.

When there was serious illness the slaves had the attention of Dr.
Ferrel.

On other occasions the old remedy of castor oil and turpentine was
administered.

There was very little sickness then according to Mr. Lewis. Most every
family kept a large pot of" Bitters"( a mixture of whiskey and tree
barks) and each morning every member of the family took a drink from
this bucket.

This supposedly prevented illness. When the war broke out Mr. Lewis
says that he often heard the old folks whispering among themselves
at night.

Several times he saw the Northern troops as well as the Southern
troops but he dos' nt know whether they were going or coming from
the scene of the fighting.

Doctor Ferrel joined the army but on three different occasions he deserted.
Before going to war Dr. Ferrel called Mr. Lewis to him and after giving
him his favorite horse gave him the following" charge"" Don' t let the
Yankees get him".

Every morning Mr. Lewis would take the horse to the woods where he hid with him all day. On several occasions
Dr. Ferrel slipped back to his home to see if the horse was being properly cared for. All of
the other valuables belongings to the Ferrels were hidden also. All
of the slaves on the plantation were glad when they were told that
they were free but there was no big demonstration as they were somewhat
afraid of what the Master might do.

Some of them remained on the plantation while others of them left as soon as they were told that
they were free. Several months after freedom was declared Mr. Lewis' father was able to join
his family which he had not seen since they had moved to Georgia.

When asked his opinion of slavery and of freedom Mr. Lewis said that he would
rather be free because to a certain degree he is able to do as he
pleases, on the other hand he did not have to worry about food and
shelter as a slave as he has to do now at times.

The old Negress was tired and while resting she talked of days long passed and of how things have changed since
she was" a little gal."" My pa wuz William Young, and he belonged to old Marse Wylie Young
and later to young Marse Mack Young, a son of old marster.

Pa wuz born in 1841, and he died in 1918." Ma wuz Lula Lumpkin, and she belonged to Marse Jack Lumpkin. I forgits
de year, but she wuz jus' 38 years old when she died. Ma' s young
mistis wuz Miss Mirriam Lumpkin, and she wuz sho' good ter my ma. I'
members,' cause I seed her lots of times.

She married Marse William Nichols, and she ain' t been dead many years." I wuz born at Steebens( Stephens),
Georgia, in 1862 at seben' clock in de mornin' on de 27th day of April. Yassum, I got here in
time for breakfast. Dey named me Mirriam Young. When I wuz' bout eight years old, us moved on de Bowling
Green road dat runs to Lexin' ton, Georgia. to wuk. I wukked for 25 dollars
a year and my schoolin'. Den I nussed for Marse George Rice in Hutchins,
Georgia.

I think Marse George and his twin sister stays in Lexin' ton now.

When I wuz twelve, I went to wuk for Marse John I. Callaway. Ma hired
me for de same pay, 25 dollars a year and my schoolin'." Missus Callaway
sho' wuz good to me.

Sha larnt me my books-- readin' and writin'-- and sewin', knittin',
and crochetin'. I still got some of de wuk dat she larnt me to do."

At this point Aunt Merry proudly displayed a number of articles that she had crocheted and knitted.
All were fashioned after old patterns and showed fine workmanship."

Mistis larnt me to be neat and clean in evvything I done, and I would walk' long de road a- knittin'
and nebber miss a stitch. I just bet none of dese young folkses
now days could do dat. Dey sho' don' t do no wuk, just run' round
all de time, day and night.

I don' t know what' ll' come of' em, lessen dey change deir ways." Whilst I wuz still nussin'
Missis' little gal and baby boy dey went down to Buffalo Crick to
stay, and dey give me a pretty gray mare.

She wuz all mine and her name wuz Lucy." I tuk de chillun to ride evvy day and down at de crick, I pulled
off dey clo' es and baptized' em, in de water.

I would wade out in de crick wid' em, and say:' I baptizes you in de name of de Fadder and de Son and de Holy
Ghost.' Den I would souse' em under de water. I didn' t know nobody wuz seein' me, but one
mornin' Missis axed me' bout it and I thought she mought be mad but she just laughed and said dat
hit mought be good for' em,' cause she' spect dey needed baptizin',
but to be keerful, for just on t' other side of de rock wuz a hole
dat didn' t have no bottom."

Dere wuz just two things on de place dat I wuz' fraid of, and one wuz
de big registered bull on Marster' s horse, my mare started runnin' and
I couldn' t stop' er. She runned plumb away wid me, and when de boy
cotched us, I wuz holdin' de baby wid one hand and de saddle wid
t' other."

I sho' did have a big time once when us went to Atlanta. De place whar
us stayed wuz' bout four miles out, whar Kirkwood is now, and it
belonged to Mrs. Robert A. Austin.

She wuz
a widder' oman. She had a gal name' Mary and us chillun used to play
together. It wuz a pretty place wid great big yards, and de mostes' flowers. Us
used to go into Atlanta on de six' clock' commodation, and come home on de
two' clock' commodation, but evvythings changed now." At de Callaway
place us colored folks had big suppers and all day dinners, wid plenty
to eat-- chicken, turkey, and' possum, and all de hogs us wanted.

But dere warnt no dancin' or fightin',' cause old Missis sho' didn'
t' low dat."

I married when I wuz sebenteen. I this didn' t have no weddin'. I wuz just
married by de preacher to Albert McCommons, at Hutchins. Us stayed
at Steebens' bout one year after us married and den come to Athens,
whar I stays now.

I ain' t never had but two chillun; dey wuz twins, one died, but my boy is wid me now." I used to nuss
Miss Calline Davis, and she done got married and left here, but I still hears from' er. She done married
one of dem northern mens, Mr. Hope. I' members one time whilst dey wuz visitin' I stayed wid' em
to nuss deir baby. One of Mr. Hope' s friends from New York wuz wid' em. When dey got to de train
to go home, Miss Calline kissed me good- bye and de yankee didn'

all."

As the interviewer left, Aunt Merry followed her into the yard asking for a return visit and promising
to tell more," bout my good white folkses." The small front yard was gay with snapdragons, tiger lilies,
dahlias, and other colorful flowers, and the Us stayed dar' til I
wuz' bout 10 years old, den us moved to de old Hutchins place.

I wukked in de field wid my pa' til I wuz' bout' leben years old. Den ma put me out two- story frame

residence. Chewing on a cud of tobacco, Ed answered the knock on
his front door." Good evenin' Lady," he said."

Have a cheer on de porch whar it' s cool." Ed is about five feet,
six inches in height, and on this afternoon he was wearing a blue
striped shirt, black vest, gray pants and black shoes.

His gray hair was topped by a soiled gray hat. Nett, his wife, came
hobbling out on the porch and sat down to listen to the conversation.

At first the old man was reluctant to talk of his childhood experiences,
but his interest was aroused by questioning and soon he began to eagerly
volunteer his memories.

He had just had his noon meal and now and then would doze a little,
but was easily aroused when questions called him back to the subject."

I was borned in Oconee County," he said," jus' below Watkinsville.
My Ma and Pa was Louisa and Henry McCree, but Old Marster called
Pa' Sherm' for short.

Far as I ever heared, my Ma and Pa was borned and brung up right dar in
Oconee County.

Dere was six of us chillun: Silas, Lumpkin, Bennie, Lucy, Babe, and me.
Babe, she was borned a long time atter de war."

Pore white folks lived in houses lak dat too.

For mattresses, de' omans put wheat straw in ticks made out of coarse

Ole Miss, she let her special favorite Niggers, what wuked up at de

 He moved to South McAlester and opened a faro game--a square game they said it was--for
the Territory! This meant that unless Joe was hard up every man had his chance before the wheel.
Old George took the longest trip of his life, when we got him a pass to South McAlester and
he put on his black frock coat and went to visit Joe. All that we learned from him was that
Joe "had changed a good deal," and that he was "taking everything in the drug store, from the
big green bottle at the right of the front door clear around past the red prescription case,
and back to the big blue bottle at the left of the door." But after George came home the Mission
Sunday-School began to thrive. George was not afraid of tainted money, and the school got a
new library, which included "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn," as well as "Hans Brinker and
the Silver Skates" for the boys, and all the "Pansy" books for the girls. It was a quaint old
lot of books, and George Kirwin was nearly a year getting it together. Also he bought a new
stove for his Sunday-School room, and a lot of pictures for the church walls, among others
"Wide Awake and Fast Asleep," "Simply to Thy Cross," and "The Old Oaken Bucket." He gave to
the school a cabinet organ with more stops than most of the children could count.

A year ago a new reporter brought in this item: "Joseph Nevison, of South McAlester, I. T.,
is visiting his mother, Mrs. Julia Nevison, at 234 South Fifth Street."

We sent the reporter out for more about Joe Nevison and at noon George Kirwin hurried down
to the little home below the tracks. From these two searchers after truth we learned that Joe
Nevison's mother had brought him home from the Indian Territory mortally sick. Half-a-dozen
of us who had played with him as boys went to see him that evening, and found a wan, haggard
man with burned-out black eyes, lying in a clean white bed. He seemed to know each of us for
a moment and spoke to us through his delirium in a tired, piping voice--like the voice of the
little boy who had been our leader. He called us by forgotten nicknames, and he hummed at a
tune that we had not heard for a score of years. Then he piped out "While the Landlubbers Lie
Down Below, Below, Below," and followed that with "Green Grass Growing all Around, all Around,"
and that with the song about the "Tonga Islands," his voice growing into a clearer alto as
he sang. His mother tried to quiet him, but he smiled his dead smile at her through his cindery
eyes, shook his head and went on. When he had lain quiet for a moment, he turned to one of
us and said: "Dock, I'm goin' up and dive off that stump--a back flip-flop--you dassent!" Pretty
soon he seemed to come up snuffing and blowing and grinning and said, "Last man dressed got
to chaw beef." Then he cried: "Dock's it--Dock's it; catch 'im, hold him--there he goes--duck
him, strip him. O well, let him go if he's go'n' to cry. Say, boys, I wish you fellers'd come
over t' my stick horse livery stable--honest I got the best hickory horse you ever see. Whoa,
there--whoa now, I tell you. You Pilliken Dunlevy let me harness you; there, put it under your
arm, and back of your neck--no I ain't go'n' to let you hold it--I'll jerk the tar out of you
if you don't go. Whe-e-e that's the way to go, hol--hold on, whoa there. Back up. Let's go
over to Jim's and run on his track. Say, Jim, I got the best little pacer in the country here--get
up there, Pilliken," and he clucked and sawed his arms, and cracked an imaginary whip. When
George came in, the face on the bed brightened and the treble voice said: "Hello Fatty--we've
been waitin' for you. Now let's go on. What you got in your wagon--humph--bet it's a pumpkin.
Did old Boswell chase you?" and then he laughed, and turned away from us. His trembling hands
seemed to be fighting something from his face. "Bushes," whispered Enoch Haver, and then added,
"Now he's climbing up the bank of the ravine." And we saw the lean hands on the bed clutch
up the wall, and then the voice broke forth: "Me first--first up--get away from here, Dock--I
said first," and we could see his hands climbing an imaginary tree.

His face glowed with the excitement of his delirium as he climbed, and then apparently catching
his breath he rested before he called out: "I'm comin' down, clear the track for old Dan Tucker,"
and from the convulsive gripping of his hands and arms and the hysterical intake of his breath
we who had seen Joe Nevison dive from the top of the old tree, from limb to limb to the bottom,
knew what he was doing. His heart was thumping audibly when he finished, and we tried to calm
him. For a while we all sat about him in silence--forgetting the walls that shut us in, and
living with him in the open, Slaves of the Magic Tree. Then one by one we left and only George
Kirwin stayed with the sick man.

Joe Nevison had lived a wicked life. He had been the friend and companion of vile men and the
women whom such men choose, and they had lived lives such as we in our little town only read
about--and do not understand. Yet all that night Joe Nevison roamed through the woods by the
creek, a little child, and no word passed his lips that could have brought a hint of the vicious
life that his manhood had known.

In that long night, while George Kirwin sat by his dying friend, listening to his babble, two
men were in the genii's hands. They put off their years as a garment. Together they ran over
the roofs of buildings on Main Street that have been torn down for thirty years; they played
in barns and corncribs burned down so long ago that their very site is in doubt; they romped
over prairies where now are elm-covered streets; and they played with boys and girls who have
lain forgotten in little sunken graves for a quarter of a century, out on the hill; or they
called from the four winds of heaven playmates who left our town at a time so remote that to
the watcher by the bed it seemed ages ago. The games they played were of another day than this.
When Joe began crying "Barbaree," he summoned a troop of ghosts, and the pack went scampering
through the spectre town in the starlight; and when that game had tired him the voice began
to chatter of "Slap-and-a-kick," and "Foot-and-a-half," and of "Rolly-poley," and of the ball
games--"Scrub," and "Town-ball," and "Anteover," each old game conjuring up spirits from its
own vasty deep until the room was full of phantoms and the watcher's memory ached with the
sweet sorrow of old joys.

George Kirwin says that long after midnight Joe awakened from a doze, fumbling through the
bedclothes, looking for something. Finally he complained that he could not find his mouth-harp.
They tried to make him forget it, but when they failed, his mother went to the bureau and pulling
open the lower drawer found a little varnished box; under the shaded lamp she brought out a
sack of marbles, a broken bean-shooter, with whittled prongs, a Barlow knife, a tintype picture
of a boy, and the mouth-organ. This she gave to the hands that fluttered about the face on
the pillow. He began to play "The Mocking Bird," opening and shutting his bony hands to let
the music rise and fall. When he closed that tune he played "O the Mistletoe Bough," and after
that over and over again he played "Tenting on the Old Camp Ground." When he dropped the mouth-harp,
he lay very still for a time, though his lips moved incessantly. The morning was coming, and
he was growing weak. But when his voice came back they knew that he was far afield again; for
he said, "Come on, fellers, let's set down here under the hill and rest. It's a long ways back."
When he had rested he spoke up again, "Say, fellers, what'll we sing?" George tried him with
a gospel hymn, but Joe would have none of it, and reviled the song and the singer after the
fashion of boys. In a moment he exclaimed: "Here--listen to me. Let's sing this," and his alto
voice came out uncertainly and faintly: "Wrap Me up in My Tarpaulin Jacket."

George Kirwin's rough voice joined the song and the mother listened and wept. Other old songs
followed, but Joe Nevison, the man, never woke up. It was the little boy full of the poetry
and sweetness of a child at play, the boy who had turned the poetry of his boyish soul into
a life of adventure unchecked by moral restraint, whose eyes they closed that morning.

And George Kirwin explained to us when he came down to work that afternoon, that maybe the
bad part of Joe Nevison's soul had shrivelled away during his sickness, instead of waiting
for death. George told us that what made him sad was that a soul in which there was so much
that might have been good had been stunted by life and was entering eternity with so little
to show for its earthly journey.

When one considers it, one finds that Joe Nevison wasted his life most miserably. There was
nothing to his credit to say in his obituary--no good deed to recount and there were many,
many bad ones. Moreover, the sorrow and bitterness that he brought into his father's last days,
and the shame that he put upon his mother, who lived to see his end, made it impossible for
our paper to say of him any kind thing that would not have seemed maudlin.

Yet at Joe Nevison's funeral the old settlers, many of them broken in years and by trouble,
gathered at the little wooden church in the hollow below the track, to see the last of him,
though certainly not to pay him a tribute of respect. They remembered him as the little boy
who had trudged up the hill to school when the old stone schoolhouse was the only stone building
in town; they remembered him as he was in the days when he began to turn Marshal Furgeson's
hair grey with wild pranks. They remembered the boy's childish virtues, and could feel the
remorse that must at times have gnawed his heart. Also these old men and women knew of the
devil of unbridled passion that the child's father had put into Joe's blood. And when he started
down the broad road they had seen his track beyond him. So as the little gathering of old people
filed through the church door and lined up on the sidewalk waiting for the mourners to come
out, we heard through the crowd white haired men sighing: "Poor Joe; poor fellow." Can one
hope that God's forgiveness will be fuller than that!

XIII

A Pilgrim in the Wilderness

A few years ago we were getting out a special edition of our paper, printed on book-paper,
and filled with pictures of the old settlers, and we called it "the historical edition." In
preparing the historical edition we had to confer with "Aunt" Martha Merrifield so often that
George Kirwin, the foreman, who was kept trotting to her with proof-slips and copy for her
to revise, remarked, as he was making up the last form of the troublesome edition, that, if
the recording angel ever had a fire in his office, he could make up the record for our town
from "Aunt" Martha's scrapbook. In that big, fat, crinkly-leafed book, she has pasted so many
wedding notices and birth notices and death notices that one who reads the book wonders how
so many people could have been born, married and died in a town of only ten thousand inhabitants.
One evening, while the historical edition was growing, a reporter spent the evening with "Aunt"
Martha. The talk drifted back to the early days, and "Aunt" Martha mentioned Balderson. To
identify him she went to her scrapbook, and as she was turning the pages she said:

"In those days of the early seventies, before the railroad came, when the town awoke in the
morning and found a newly arrived covered waggon near a neighbour's house, it always meant
that kin had come. If at school that day the children from the house of visitation bragged
about their relatives, expatiating upon the power and riches that they left back East, the
town knew that the visitors were ordinary kin; but if the children from the afflicted household
said little about the visitors and evidently tried to avoid telling just who they were, then
the town knew that the strangers were poor kin--probably some of "his folks"; for it was well
understood that the women in this town all came from high connections 'back East' in Illinois,
Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa. Newcomers sometimes wondered how such a galaxy of princesses and duchesses
and ladyships happened to marry so far beneath their station.

"But the Dixons had no children, so when a covered waggon drove up to their place in the night,
and a fussy, pussy little man with a dingy, stringy beard, appeared in the Dixons' back yard
in the morning, looking after the horses hitched to the strange waggon; the town had to wait
until the next week's issue of the Statesman to get reliable news about their prospective fellow-citizen."
With that "Aunt" Martha opened her scrapbook and read a clipping from the Statesman, under
the head, "A Valuable Acquisition to Our City." It ran:

"It has been many months since we have been favoured with a call from so cultured and learned
a gentleman as the Hon. Andoneran P. Balderson, late of Quito, Hancock County, Iowa, who has
finally determined to settle in our midst. Cramped by the irritating conventionalities of an
effete civilisation, Colonel Balderson comes among us for that larger freedom and wider horizon
which his growing powers demand. He comes with the ripened experience of a jurist, a soldier,
and a publicist, and, when transportation facilities have been completed between this and the
Missouri River, Judge Balderson will bring to our little city his magnificent law library;
but until then he will be found over the Elite Oyster Bay, where he will be glad to welcome
clients and others.

"Having participated in the late War of the Rebellion, as captain in Company G of Colonel Jennison's
famous and invincible army of the border, Colonel Balderson will give special attention to
pension matters. He also will set to work to obtain a complete set of abstracts, and will be
glad to give advice on real-estate law and the practice of eminent domain, to which subject
he has given deep study. All business done with neatness and despatch.

"Before leaving Iowa, and after considerable pressure, Judge Balderson consented to act as
agent for a number of powerful Eastern fire insurance companies, and has in contemplation the
establishment of the Southwestern distributing point for the Multum in Parvo Farm Gate Company,
of which corporation Colonel Balderson owns the patent right for Kansas. This business, however,
he would be willing to dispose of to proper parties. Terms on application.

"The colonel desires us to announce that there will be a meeting of the veterans of the late
war at the schoolhouse next Saturday night, for the purpose of organising a society to refresh
and perpetuate the sacred memories of that gigantic struggle, and to rally around the old flag,
touch shoulders again, and come into a closer fellowship for benevolent, social, and other
purposes. The judge, on that occasion, will deliver his famous address on the 'Battle of Look
Out Mountain,' in which battle Colonel Balderson participated as a member of an Iowa regiment.
Admission free. Silver collection to defray necessary expenses."

Accompanying this article was a slightly worn woodcut of the colonel in his soldier garb, a
cap with the top drawn forward, the visor low over his eyes, and a military overcoat thrown
gaily back, exposing his shoulder. The picture showed the soldier in profile, with a fierce
military moustache and a stubby, runty goatee, meant to strike terror to the civilian heart.

From "Aunt" Martha we learned that before Judge Balderson had been in town a week he had dyed
his whiskers and had taken command of our forces in the county-seat war then brewing. During
the judge's first month in the county the campaign for the county-seat election was opened,
and he canvassed the north end of the county for our town, denouncing, with elaborate eloquence,
as horse thieves, mendicants, and renegades from justice, the settlers in the south end of
the county who favoured the rival town. The judge organised a military company and picketed
the hills about our town day and night against a raid from the Southenders; and, having stirred
public passion deeply, he turned his pickets loose on the morning of election day to set prairie
fires all over the south end of the county to harass the settlers who might vote for the rival
town and keep them away from the polls fighting fire.

Our people won; "the hell-hounds of disorder and anarchy"--as Judge Balderson called the rival
townspeople--were "rebuked by the stern hand of a just and terrible Providence." Balderson
was a hero, and our people sent him to the legislature. "Aunt" Martha added:

"He went to Topeka in his blue soldier clothes, his campaign hat, and brass buttons; but he
came back, at the first recess, in diamonds and fine linen, and the town sniffed a little."
Having learned this much of Balderson our office became interested in him, and a reporter was
set to work to look up Balderson. The reporter found that according to Wilder's "Annals," Balderson
hustled himself into the chairmanship of the railroad committee and became a power in the State.
The next time Colonel "Alphabetical" Morrison came to the office he was asked for further details
about Balderson. The Colonel told us that when the legislature finally adjourned, very proud
and very drunk, in the bedlam of the closing hours, Judge Balderson mounted a desk, waved the
Stars and Stripes, and told of the Battle of Look Out Mountain. Colonel Morrison chuckled as
he added: "The next day the State Journal printed his picture--the one with the slouching cap,
the military moustache, the fierce goatee, and the devil-may-care cape--and referred to the
judge as 'the silver-tongued orator of the Cottonwood,' a title which began to amuse the fellows
around town."

Naturally he was a candidate for Congress. Colonel Morrison says that Balderson became familiarly
known in State politics as Little Baldy, and was in demand at soldiers' meetings and posed
as the soldier's friend.

Wilder's "Annals" records the fact that Balderson failed to go to Congress, but went to the
State Senate. He waxed fat. We learned that he bought a private bank and all the books recording
abstracts of title to land in his county, and that he affected a high silk hat when he went
to Chicago, while his townsmen were inclined to eye him askance. The lack of three votes from
his home precinct kept him from being nominated lieutenant-governor by his party, but Colonel
Morrison says that Balderson soon took on the title of governor, and was unruffled by his defeat.
The Colonel describes Balderson as assuming the air of a kind of sacred white cow, and putting
much hair-oil and ointment and frankincense upon his carcass. Other old settlers say that in
those days his dyed whiskers fairly glistened. And when, at State conventions, in the fervour
of his passion he unbent, unbuttoned his frock-coat, grabbed the old flag, and charged up and
down the platform in an oratorical frensy, it seemed that another being had emerged from the
greasy little roll of adipose in which "Governor" Balderson enshrined himself. His climax was
invariably the wavering battle-line upon the mountain, the flag tottering and about to fall,
"when suddenly it rises and goes forward, up--up--up the hill, through the smoke of hell, and
full and fair into the teeth of death, with ten thousand cheering, maddened soldiers behind
it. And who carried that flag--who carried that flag?" he would scream, in a tremulous voice,
repeating his question over and over, and then answer himself in tragic bass: "The little corporal
of Company B!" And, "Who fell into the arms of victory that great day, with four wounds upon
his body? The little corporal of Company B!" It is hardly necessary to add that Governor Balderson
was the little corporal.

After the failure of his bank, when rumour accused him of burning the court-house that he might
sell his abstracts to the county at a fabulous price, he called a public meeting to hear his
defence, and repeated to his townsmen that query, "Who carried the flag?" adding in a hoarse
whisper: "And yet--great God!--they say that the little corporal is an in-cen-di-ary. Was this
great war fought in vain, that tr-e-e-sin should lift her hydra head to hiss out such blasphemy
upon the boys who wore the blue?"

However, the evidence was against him, and as our people had long since lost interest in the
flag-bearer, the committee gave him five minutes to leave. He returned three minutes in change
and struck out over the hill towards the west, afoot, and the town knew him no more forever.

Where Balderson went after leaving town no one seems to know. The earth might have swallowed
him up. But in 1882 someone sent a marked copy of the Denver Tribune to the Statesman office,
the Statesman reprinted it, and "Aunt" Martha filed it away in her book. Here is it:

"Big Burro Springs, Colorado, September 7th (Special).--Three men were killed yesterday in
a fight between the men at Jingle-bob ranch and a surveying party under A. P. Balderson. The
Balderson party consisted of four men, among whom was 'Rowdy' Joe Nevison, the famous marshal
of Leoti, Kansas. They were locating a reservoir site which Balderson has taken up on Burro
Creek for the Balderson Irrigation Company and for supplying the Look Out Townsite Company
with water. These are Balderson's schemes, and, if established, will put the Jingle-bob ranch
people out of business, as they have no title to the land on which they are operating. The
remarkable part of the fight is that which Balderson took in it. After two of his men had been
killed and the owner of the Jingle-bob ranch had fallen, Balderson and his two remaining men
came forward with hands up, waving handkerchiefs. The Jingle-bob people recognised the flag
of truce, and Balderson led his men across the creek to the cow-camp. Just as he approached
close enough to the man who had the party covered, Balderson yelled, 'Watch out--back of you!'
and, as all the captors turned their heads, Balderson knocked the pistol from the hand of the
only man whose weapon was pointed at the Balderson party, and the next moment the cow-men looked
into the barrels of the surveyors' three revolvers, and were told that if they budged a hair
they would be killed. Balderson then disarmed the cow-men, and, after passing around the drinks,
hired the outfit as policemen for the town of Look Out. It is said that he has given them two
thousand dollars apiece in Irrigation Company stock, has promised to defend them if they are
charged with the murder of the two surveyors, and has given each cow-man a deed to a corner
lot on the public square of the prospective Balderson town. Deputy Sheriff Crosby from this
place went over to arrest Balderson, charged with killing D. V. Sherman of the Jingle-bob property,
and, after asking for his warrant, Balderson took it, put it in his pocket, advised the deputy
to hurry home, and, if he found any coyotes or jack-rabbits that couldn't get out of his way
fast enough, not to stop to kill them, but shoo them off the trail and save time."

They say in Colorado that Balderson became an irrigation king. It is certain that he raised
half a million dollars in New York for his dam and ditches. He built the "Look Out Opera House,"
and decorated it in gilded stucco and with red plush two inches deep. Morrison contributed
this anecdote to the office Legend of Balderson: "He was in Florida in his private car when
they finished the opera house. When he came back and saw a plaster bust of Shakespeare over
the proscenium arch, he waved his cane pompously and exclaimed: 'Take her down! Bill Shakespeare
is all right for the effete East, but out here he ain't deuce high with the little corporal
of Company B.'" So in Shakespeare's niche is a plaster-cast of a soldier's face with the slouch-cap,
the military moustache, and the goatee of great pride, after the picture that once adorned
the columns of the Statesman. For a time they talked of Balderson for United States Senator,
and, at the laying of the corner-stone of the capitol, the Denver papers spoke of the masterly
oration of former Governor Balderson of Kansas, whose marvellous word-painting of the Battle
of Look Out Mountain held the vast audience spellbound for an hour. A few months later a cloudburst
carried away the Big Burro dam, and times went bad, and the stockholders in Balderson's company,
who would have rebuilt the dam, could not find Balderson when they needed him, and certain
creditors of the company, hitherto unknown, appeared, and Balderson faded away like a morning star.

Here is a part of the narrative that George Kirwin got from Joe Nevison: Joe began with the
coal strike at Castle Rock, Wyoming, in 1893, when the strikers massed on Flat Top Mountain
and day after day went through their drill. He told a highly dramatic story of the stoutish
little man of fifty-five, with a fat, smooth-shaven face, who pounded that horde of angry men
into some semblance of military order. All day the little man, in his shrunken seersucker coat
and greasy white hat, would bark orders at the men, march and counter-march them, and go through
the manual of arms, backward and forward and seven hands round. When the battle with the militia
came, the strikers charged down Flat Top and fought bravely. The little man in the seersucker
coat stayed with them, snapping orders at them, damning them, coaxing them. And when the deputies
gathered up the strikers for the trial in court two months later, the little man was still
there. He was prospecting on a gopher-hole somewhere up in the hills, and was trying to get
his wildcat mine listed on the Salt Lake Mining Exchange. No one gave bond for the little man
in the seersucker coat, and he went to jail. He was Balderson. He seemed to give little heed
to the trial, and sat with the strikers rather stolidly. Venire after venire of jurymen was
gone through. At last an old man wearing a Loyal Legion button went into the jury-box. Balderson
saw him; they exchanged recognising glances, and Balderson turned scarlet and looked away quickly.
He nudged an attorney for the strikers and said: "Keep him, whatever you do."

After the evidence was all in and the attorneys were about to make their arguments, Balderson
and one of the lawyers for the strikers were alone.

"They told me to take the part about you, Balderson; you were in the Union Army, weren't you?"

Balderson looked at the floor and said:

"Yes; but don't say anything about it."

The lawyer, who knew Balderson's record, was astonished. He had made his whole speech up on
the line that Balderson as an old soldier would appeal to the sympathies of the jury. Over
and over the lawyer pressed Balderson to know why nothing should be said of his soldier record,
and finally in exasperation the lawyer broke out:

"Lookee here, Baldy; you're too old to get coy. I'm going to make my speech as I've mapped
it out, soldier racket and all. I guess you've taken enough trips up Look Out Mountain to get
used to the altitude by this time."

The lawyer started away, but Balderson grabbed him and pulled him back. "Don't do it; for God's
sake, don't do it! There's a fellow on that jury that's a G. A. R. man; we were soldiers together;
he knows me from away back. Talk of Iowy; talk of Kansas; talk of anything on God's green earth,
but don't talk soldier. That man would wade through hell for me neck deep on any other basis
than that." Balderson's voice was quivering. He added: "But don't talk soldier." Balderson
slumped, with his head in his hands. The attorney snapped at him:

"Weren't you a soldier?"

"Yes; oh, yes," Balderson sighed.

"Didn't you go up Look Out Mountain?"

"Oh, yes--that, too."

There was a silence between the men. The lawyer rasped it with, "Well, what then?"

"Well--well," and the tousled little man sighed so deeply his sigh was almost a sob, and lifted
up the eyes of a whipped dog to the lawyer's--"after that I got in the commissary department--and--and--was
dishonourably discharged." He rubbed his eyes with his fingers a moment and then grinned foxily:
"Ain't that enough?"

Roosevelt is a mining-camp in Idaho. It is five days from a morning paper, and the camp is
new. It is a log town with one street and no society, except such as may gather around the
big box-stove at Johnnie Conyer's saloon. A number of ladies and two women lived in the camp,
a few tin-horn "gents," and about two hundred men. It is a seven months' snow-camp, where men
take their drama canned in the phonograph, their food canned, their medicine all out of one
bottle, and their morals "without benefit of clergy." Across the front of one of the canvas-covered
log store-rooms that fringe the single street a cloth sign is stretched. It reads, "Department
Store," and inside a dance hall, a saloon, and a gambling-place are operating. A few years
ago, when Colonel Alphabetical Morrison was travelling through the West on a land deal for
John Markley, business took him to Roosevelt, and he found Balderson, grey of beard, shiny
of pate, with unkempt, ratty back hair; he was watery-eyed, and his red-veined skin had slipped
down from his once fat face into draperies over his lean neck and jowls. He was in the dealer's
chair, running the game.

The statute of limitations had covered all his Kansas misdeeds, and he nodded affably as his
old acquaintance came in. Later in the day the two men went to Mrs. Smith's boarding-house
to take a social bite. They sat in front of the log-house in the evening, Balderson mellow
and reminiscent.

"Seems to me this way: I ain't cut out for society as it is organised. I do all right in a
town until the piano begins to get respectable and the rules of order are tucked snugly inside
the decalogue, then I slip my belt, and my running gear doesn't track. I get a few grand and
noble thoughts, freeze to 'em, and later find that the hereditary appurtenances thereunto appertaining
are private property of someone else, and there is nothing for me to do but to stand a lawsuit
or vanish. I have had bad luck, lost my money, lost my friends, lost my conscience, lost everything,
pretty near"--and here he turned his watery eyes on his friend with a saw-toothed smile and
shook his depleted abdomen, that had been worn off climbing many hills--"I've lost everything,
pretty near, but my vermiform appendix and my table of contents, and as like as not I'll find
some feller's got them copyrighted." He heaved a great sigh and resumed, "I suppose I could
'a' stood it all well enough if I had just had some sort of faith, some religious consolation,
some creed, or god, or something." He sighed again, and then leered up: "But, you know--I'm
so damned skeptic!"

Last spring, according to the Boisé, Idaho, papers, "Governor" Balderson and two other old
soldiers celebrated Memorial Day in Roosevelt. They got a muslin flag as big as the flap of
a shirt, from heaven knows where, and in the streets of Roosevelt they hoisted this flag on
the highest pine pole in all the Salmon River Mountains. There were elaborate ceremonies, and
to the miners and gamblers and keepers of wildcat mines in the mountains assembled, "Governor"
Balderson told eloquently of the Battle of Look Out Mountain. And Colonel Morrison who read
the account smiled appreciatively and pointed out to us the exact stage in the proceedings
where Balderson demanded to know who carried the flag. There was long and tumultuous applause
at the climax.

We also read in the Boisé papers that at the fall election in Roosevelt they made Balderson
justice of the peace, which, as Colonel Morrison explained, was a purely honorary office in
a community where every man is his own court and constable and jury and judge; but the Colonel
said that Balderson was proud of official distinction, and probably levied mild tribute from
the people who indulged in riotous living, by compelling them to buy drink-checks redeemable
only at his department store.

It was from the Boisé papers that we had the final word from Balderson. A message came to Roosevelt
this spring that an outfit, thirty miles away at the head of Profile Creek, was sick and starving.
It was a dangerous trip to the rescue, for snowslides were booming on every southern hillside.
Death would literally play tag with the man who dared to hit the trail for Profile. Balderson
did not hesitate a moment, but filled his pack with provisions, put a marked deck and some
loaded dice in his pocket, and waved Roosevelt a cheery good-by as he struck out over the three
logs that bridge Mule Creek. He was bundled to the chin in warm coats, and on his way met Hot
Foot Higgins coming in from Profile. Balderson seems to have given Higgins his warmest coat
before the snow-slide hit them. It killed them both. Hot Foot died instantly, but Balderson
must have lived many hours, for the snow about his body was melted and in his pocket they found
Hot Foot's watch.

They buried him near the trail where they found him, and, stuck in a candle-box, over the heap
of stones above him, flutters lonesomely in the desolation of the mountain-side the little
muslin rag that was once a flag. They call the hill on which he sleeps "Look Out Mountain."

Late this spring the mail brought to the office of the Boisé Capital-News a battered woodcut
half a century old. When the News came to our office we saw the familiar soldier's face in
profile, with a cap drawn over the eyes, with a waving moustache and a fierce goatee, and across
the shoulders of the figure a military cape thrown back jauntily. With the old cut in the Boisé
paper was an article which the editor says in a note was written in a young woman's angular
handwriting, done in pencil on wrapping-paper. The article told, in spelling unspeakable, of
the greatness and goodness of "Ex-Governor Balderson of Kansas." It related that he was ever
the "friend to the friendless"; that, "with all his worldly honours, he was modest and unassuming";
that "he had his faults, as who of us have not," but that he was "honest, tried and true";
and the memorial closed with the words: "Heaven's angel gained is Roosevelt's hero lost."

XIV

The Passing of Priscilla Winthrop

What a dreary waste life in our office must have been before Miss Larrabee came to us to edit
a society page for the paper! To be sure we had known in a vague way that there were lines
of social cleavage in the town; that there were whist clubs and dancing clubs and women's clubs,
and in a general way that the women who composed these clubs made up our best society, and
that those benighted souls beyond the pale of these clubs were out of the caste. We knew that
certain persons whose names were always handed in on the lists of guests at parties were what
we called "howling swells." But it remained for Miss Larrabee to sort out ten or a dozen of
these "howling swells" who belonged to the strictest social caste in town, and call them "howling
dervishes." Incidentally it may be said that both Miss Larrabee and her mother were dervishes,
but that did not prevent her from making sport of them. From Miss Larrabee we learned that
the high priestess of the howling dervishes of our society was Mrs. Mortimer Conklin, known
by the sisterhood of the mosque as Priscilla Winthrop. We in our office had never heard her
called by that name, but Miss Larrabee explained, rather elaborately, that unless one was permitted
to speak of Mrs. Conklin thus, one was quite beyond the hope of a social heaven.

In the first place, Priscilla Winthrop was Mrs. Conklin's maiden name; in the second place,
it links her with the Colonial Puritan stock of which she is so justly proud--being scornful
of mere Daughters of the Revolution--and finally, though Mrs. Conklin is a grandmother, her
maiden name seems to preserve the sweet, vague illusion of girlhood which Mrs. Conklin always
carries about her like the shadow of a dream. And Miss Larrabee punctuated this with a wink
which we took to be a quotation mark, and she went on with her work. So we knew we had been
listening to the language used in the temple.

Our town was organised fifty years ago by Abolitionists from New England, and twenty years
ago, when Alphabetical Morrison was getting out one of the numerous boom editions of his real
estate circular, he printed an historical article therein in which he said that Priscilla Winthrop
was the first white child born on the town site. Her father was territorial judge, afterward
member of the State Senate, and after ten years spent in mining in the far West, died in the
seventies, the richest man in the State. It was known that he left Priscilla, his only child,
half a million dollars in government bonds.

She was the first girl in our town to go away to school. Naturally, she went to Oberlin, famous
in those days for admitting coloured students. But she finished her education at Vassar, and
came back so much of a young lady that the town could hardly contain her. She married Mortimer
Conklin, took him to the Centennial on a wedding trip, came home, rebuilt her father's house,
covering it with towers and minarets and steeples, and scroll-saw fretwork, and christened
it Winthrop Hall. She erected a store building on Main Street, that Mortimer might have a luxurious
office on the second floor, and then settled down to the serious business of life, which was
building up a titled aristocracy in a Kansas town.

The Conklin children were never sent to the public schools, but had a governess, yet Mortimer
Conklin, who was always alert for the call, could not understand why the people never summoned
him to any office of honour or trust. He kept his brass signboard polished, went to his office
punctually every morning at ten o'clock, and returned home to dinner at five, and made clients
wait ten minutes in the outer office before they could see him--at least so both of them say,
and there were no others in all the years. He shaved every day, wore a frock-coat and a high
hat to church--where for ten years he was the only male member of the Episcopalian flock--and
Mrs. Conklin told the women that altogether he was a credit to his sex and his family--a remark
which was passed about ribaldly in town for a dozen years, though Mortimer Conklin never knew
that he was the subject of a town joke. Once he rebuked a man in the barber shop for speaking
of feminine extravagance, and told the shop that he did not stint his wife, that when she asked
him for money he always gave it to her without question, and that if she wanted a dress he
told her to buy it and send the bill to him. And we are such a polite people that no one in
the crowded shop laughed--until Mortimer Conklin went out.

Of course at the office we have known for twenty-five years what the men thought of Mortimer,
but not until Miss Larrabee joined the force did we know that among the women Mrs. Conklin
was considered an oracle. Miss Larrabee said that her mother has a legend that when Priscilla
Winthrop brought home from Boston the first sealskin sacque ever worn in town she gave a party
for it, and it lay in its box on the big walnut bureau in the spare room of the Conklin mansion
in solemn state, while seventy-five women salaamed to it. After that Priscilla Winthrop was
the town authority on sealskins. When any member of the town nobility had a new sealskin, she
took it humbly to Priscilla Winthrop to pass judgment upon it. If Priscilla said it was London-dyed,
its owner pranced away on clouds of glory; but if she said it was American-dyed, its owner
crawled away in shame, and when one admired the disgraced garment, the martyred owner smiled
with resigned sweetness and said humbly: "Yes--but it's only American-dyed, you know."

No dervish ever questioned the curse of the priestess. The only time a revolt was imminent
was in the autumn of 1884 when the Conklins returned from their season at Duxbury, Massachusetts,
and Mrs. Conklin took up the carpets in her house, heroically sold all of them at the second-hand
store, put in new waxed floors and spread down rugs. The town uprose and hooted; the outcasts
and barbarians in the Methodist and Baptist Missionary Societies rocked the Conklin home with
their merriment, and ten dervishes with set faces bravely met the onslaughts of the savages;
but among themselves in hushed whispers, behind locked doors, the faithful wondered if there
was not a mistake some place. However, when Priscilla Winthrop assured them that in all the
best homes in Boston rugs were replacing carpets, their souls were at peace.

All this time we at the office knew nothing of what was going on. We knew that the Conklins
devoted considerable time to society; but Alphabetical Morrison explained that by calling attention
to the fact that Mrs. Conklin had prematurely grey hair. He said a woman with prematurely grey
hair was as sure to be a social leader as a spotted horse is to join a circus. But now we know
that Colonel Morrison's view was a superficial one, for he was probably deterred from going
deeper into the subject by his dislike for Mortimer Conklin, who invested a quarter of a million
dollars of the Winthrop fortune in the Wichita boom, and lost it. Colonel Morrison naturally
thought as long as Conklin was going to lose that money he could have lost it just as well
at home in the "Queen City of the Prairies," giving the Colonel a chance to win. And when Conklin,
protecting his equities in Wichita, sent a hundred thousand dollars of good money after the
quarter million of bad money, Colonel Morrison's grief could find no words; though he did find
language for his wrath. When the Conklins draped their Oriental rugs for airing every Saturday
over the veranda and portico railings of the house front, Colonel Morrison accused the Conklins
of hanging out their stamp collection to let the neighbours see it. This was the only side
of the rug question we ever heard in our office until Miss Larrabee came; then she told us
that one of the first requirements of a howling dervish was to be able to quote from Priscilla
Winthrop's Rug book from memory. The Rug book, the China book and the Old Furniture book were
the three sacred scrolls of the sect.

All this was news to us. However, through Colonel Morrison, we had received many years ago
another sidelight on the social status of the Conklins. It came out in this way: Time honoured
custom in our town allows the children of a home where there is an outbreak of social revelry,
whether a church festival or a meeting of the Cold-Nosed Whist Club, to line up with the neighbour
children on the back stoop or in the kitchen, like human vultures, waiting to lick the ice-cream
freezer and to devour the bits of cake and chicken salad that are left over. Colonel Morrison
told us that no child was ever known to adorn the back yard of the Conklin home while a social
cataclysm was going on, but that when Mrs. Morrison entertained the Ladies' Literary League,
children from the holy Conklin family went home from his back porch with their faces smeared
with chicken croquettes and their hands sticky with jellycake.

This story never gained general circulation in town, but even if it had been known of all men
it would not have shaken the faith of the devotees. For they did not smile when Priscilla Winthrop
began to refer to old Frank Hagan, who came to milk the Conklin cow and curry the Conklin horse,
as "François, the man," or to call the girl who did the cooking and general housework "Cosette,
the maid," though every one of the dozen other women in town whom "Cosette, the maid" had worked
for knew that her name was Fanny Ropes. And shortly after that the homes of the rich and the
great over on the hill above Main Street began to fill with Lisettes and Nanons and Fanchons,
and Mrs. Julia Neal Worthington called her girl "Grisette," explaining that they had always
had a Grisette about the house since her mother first went to housekeeping in Peoria, Illinois,
and it sounded so natural to hear the name that they always gave it to a new servant. This
story came to the office through the Young Prince, who chuckled over it during the whole hour
he consumed in writing Ezra Worthington's obituary.

Miss Larrabee says that the death of Ezra Worthington marks such a distinct epoch in the social
life of the town that we must set down here--even if the narrative of the Conklins halts for
a moment--how the Worthingtons rose and flourished. Julia Neal, eldest daughter of Thomas Neal--who
lost the "O" before his name somewhere between the docks of Dublin and the west bank of the
Missouri River--was for ten years principal of the ward school in that part of our town known
as "Arkansaw," where her term of service is still remembered as the "reign of terror." It was
said of her then that she could whip any man in the ward--and would do it if he gave her a
chance. The same manner which made the neighbours complain that Julia Neal carried her head
too high, later in life, when she had money to back it, gave her what the women of the State
Federation called a "regal air." In her early thirties she married Ezra Worthington, bachelor,
twenty year her senior. Ezra Worthington was at that time, had been for twenty years before,
and continued to be until his death, proprietor of the Worthington Poultry and Produce Commission
Company. He was owner of the stock-yards, president of the Worthington State Bank, vice-president,
treasurer and general manager of the Worthington Mercantile Company, and owner of five brick
buildings on Main Street. He bought one suit of clothes every five years whether he needed
it or not, never let go of a dollar until the Goddess of Liberty on it was black in the face,
and died rated "As $350,000" by all the commercial agencies in the country. And the first thing
Mrs. Worthington did after the funeral was to telephone to the bank and ask them to send her
a hundred dollars.

The next important thing she did was to put a heavy, immovable granite monument over the deceased
so that he would not be restless, and then she built what is known in our town as the Worthington
Palace. It makes the Markley mansion which cost $25,000 look like a barn. The Worthingtons
in the lifetime of Ezra had ventured no further into the social whirl of the town than to entertain
the new Presbyterian preacher at tea, and to lend their lawn to the King's Daughters for a
social, sending a bill in to the society for the eggs used in the coffee and the gasoline used
in heating it.

To the howling dervishes who surrounded Priscilla Winthrop the Worthingtons were as mere Christian
dogs. It was not until three years after Ezra Worthington's death that the glow of the rising
Worthington sun began to be seen in the Winthrop mosque. During those three years Mrs. Worthington
had bought and read four different sets of the best hundred books, had consumed the Chautauqua
course, had prepared and delivered for the Social Science Club, which she organised, five papers
ranging in subject from the home life of Rameses I., through a Survey of the Forces Dominating
Michael Angelo, to the Influence of Esoteric Buddhism on Modern Political Tendencies. More
than that, she had been elected president of the City Federation of Clubs, and, being a delegate
to the National Federation from the State, was talked of for the State Federation Presidency.
When the State Federation met in our town, Mrs. Worthington gave a reception for the delegates
in the Worthington Palace, a feature of which was a concert by a Kansas City organist on the
new pipe-organ which she had erected in the music-room of her house, and despite the fact that
the devotees of the Priscilla shrine said that the crowd was distinctly mixed and not at all
representative of our best social grace and elegance, there is no question but that Mrs. Worthington's
reception made a strong impression upon the best local society. The fact that, as Miss Larrabee
said, "Priscilla Winthrop was so nice about it," also may be regarded as ominous. But the women
who lent Mrs. Worthington the spoons and forks for the occasion were delighted, and formed
a phalanx about her, which made up in numbers what it might have lacked in distinction. Yet
while Mrs. Worthington was in Europe the faithful routed the phalanx, and Mrs. Conklin returned
from her summer in Duxbury with half a carload of old furniture from Harrison Sampson's shop
and gave a talk to the priestesses of the inner temple on "Heppelwhite in New England."

Miss Larrabee reported the affair for our paper, giving the small list of guests and the long
line of refreshments--which included alligator-pear salad, right out of the Smart Set Cook
Book. Moreover, when Jefferson appeared in Topeka that fall, Priscilla Winthrop, who had met
him through some of her Duxbury friends in Boston, invited him to run down for a luncheon with
her and the members of the royal family who surrounded her. It was the proud boast of the defenders
of the Winthrop faith in town that week, that though twenty-four people sat down to the table,
not only did all the men wear frock-coats--not only did Uncle Charlie Haskins of String Town
wear the old Winthrop butler's livery without a wrinkle in it, and with only the faint odour
of mothballs to mingle with the perfume of the roses--but (and here the voices of the followers
of the prophet dropped in awe) not a single knife or fork or spoon or napkin was borrowed!
After that, when any of the sisterhood had occasion to speak of the absent Mrs. Worthington,
whose house was filled with new mahogany and brass furniture, they referred to her as the Duchess
of Grand Rapids, which gave them much comfort.

But joy is short-lived. When Mrs. Worthington came back from Europe and opened her house to
the City Federation, and gave a coloured lantern-slide lecture on "An evening with the Old
Masters," serving punch from her own cut-glass punch bowl instead of renting the hand-painted
crockery bowl of the queensware store, the old dull pain came back into the hearts of the dwellers
in the inner circle. Then just in the nick of time Mrs. Conklin went to Kansas City and was
operated on for appendicitis. She came back pale and interesting, and gave her club a paper
called "Hospital Days," fragrant with iodoform and Henley's poems. Miss Larrabee told us that
it was almost as pleasant as an operation on one's self to hear Mrs. Conklin tell about hers.
And they thought it was rather brutal--so Miss Larrabee afterward told us--when Mrs. Worthington
went to the hospital one month, and gave her famous Delsarte lecture course the next month,
and explained to the women that if she wasn't as heavy as she used to be it was because she
had had everything cut out of her below the windpipe. It seemed to the temple priestesses that,
considering what a serious time poor dear Priscilla Winthrop had gone through, Mrs. Worthington
was making light of serious things.

There is no doubt that the formal rebellion of Mrs. Worthington, Duchess of Grand Rapids, and
known of the town's nobility as the Pretender, began with the hospital contest. The Pretender
planted her siege-guns before the walls of the temple of the priestess, and prepared for business.
The first manoeuvre made by the beleaguered one was to give a luncheon in the mosque, at which,
though it was midwinter, fresh tomatoes and fresh strawberries were served, and a real authoress
from Boston talked upon John Fiske's philosophy and, in the presence of the admiring guests,
made a new kind of salad dressing for the fresh lettuce and tomatoes. Thirty women who watched
her forgot what John Fiske's theory of the cosmos is, and thirty husbands who afterward ate
that salad dressing have learned to suffer and be strong. But that salad dressing undermined
the faith of thirty mere men--raw outlanders to be sure--in the social omniscience of Priscilla
Winthrop. Of course they did not see it made; the spell of the enchantress was not over them;
but in their homes they maintained that if Priscilla Winthrop didn't know any more about cosmic
philosophy than to pay a woman forty dollars to make a salad dressing like that--and the whole
town knows that was the price--the vaunted town of Duxbury, Massachusetts, with its old furniture
and new culture, which Priscilla spoke of in such repressed ecstasy, is probably no better
than Manitou, Colorado, where they get their Indian goods from Buffalo, New York.

Such is the perverse reasoning of man. And Mrs. Worthington, having lived with considerable
of a man for fifteen years, hearing echoes of this sedition, attacked the fortification of
the faithful on its weakest side. She invited the thirty seditious husbands with their wives
to a beefsteak dinner, where she heaped their plates with planked sirloin, garnished the sirloin
with big, fat, fresh mushrooms, and topped off the meal with a mince pie of her own concoction,
which would make a man leave home to follow it. She passed cigars at the table, and after the
guests went into the music-room ten old men with ten old fiddles appeared and contested with
old-fashioned tunes for a prize, after which the company danced four quadrilles and a Virginia
reel. The men threw down their arms going home and went over in a body to the Pretender. But
in a social conflict men are mere non-combatants, and their surrender did not seriously injure
the cause that they deserted.

The war went on without abatement. During the spring that followed the winter of the beefsteak
dinner many skirmishes, minor engagements, ambushes and midnight raids occurred. But the contest
was not decisive. For purposes of military drill, the defenders of the Winthrop faith formed
themselves into a Whist Club. The Whist Club they called it, just as they spoke of Priscilla
Winthrop's gowns as "the black and white one," "the blue brocade," "the white china silk,"
as if no other black and white or blue brocade or white china silk gowns had been created in
the world before and could not be made again by human hands. So, in the language of the inner
sanctuary, there was "The Whist Club," to the exclusion of all other possible human Whist Clubs
under the stars. When summer came the Whist Club fled as birds to the mountains--save Priscilla
Winthrop, who went to Duxbury, and came home with a brass warming-pan and a set of Royal Copenhagen
china that were set up as holy objects in the temple.

But Mrs. Worthington went to the National Federation of Women's Clubs, made the acquaintance
of the women there who wore clothes from Paris, began tracing her ancestry back to the Maryland
Calverts--on her mother's side of the house--brought home a membership in the Daughters of
the Revolution, the Colonial Dames and a society which referred to Charles I. as "Charles Martyr,"
claimed a Stuart as the rightful king of England, affecting to scorn the impudence of King
Edward in sitting on another's throne. More than this, Mrs. Worthington had secured the promise
of Mrs. Ellen Vail Montgomery, Vice-President of the National Federation, to visit Cliff Crest,
as Mrs. Worthington called the Worthington mansion, and she turned up her nose at those who
worshipped under the towers, turrets and minarets of the Conklin mosque, and played the hose
of her ridicule on their outer wall that she might have it spotless for a target when she got
ready to raze it with her big gun.

The week that Ellen Vail Montgomery came to town was a busy one for Miss Larrabee. We turned
over the whole fourth page of the paper to her for a daily society page, and charged the Bee
Hive and the White Front Dry Goods store people double rates to put their special sale advertisements
on that page while the "National Vice," as the Young Prince called her, was in town. For the
"National Vice" brought the State President and two State Vices down, also four District Presidents
and six District Vices, who, as Miss Larrabee said, were monsters "of so frightful a mien,
that to be hated need but to be seen." The entire delegation of visiting stateswomen--Vices
and Virtues and Beatitudes as we called them--were entertained by Mrs. Worthington at Cliff
Crest, and there was so much Federation politics going on in our town that the New York Sun
took five hundred words about it by wire, and Colonel Alphabetical Morrison said that with
all those dressed-up women about he felt as though he was living in a Sunday supplement.

The third day of the ghost-dance at Cliff Crest was to be the day of the big event--as the
office parlance had it. The ceremonies began at sunrise with a breakfast to which half a dozen
of the captains and kings of the besieging host of the Pretender were bidden. It seems to have
been a modest orgy, with nothing more astonishing than a new gold-band china set to dishearten
the enemy. By ten o'clock Priscilla Winthrop and the Whist Club had recovered from that; but
they had been asked to the luncheon--the star feature of the week's round of gayety. It is
just as well to be frank, and say that they went with fear and trembling. Panic and terror
were in their ranks, for they knew a crisis was at hand. It came when they were "ushered into
the dining-hall," as our paper so grandly put it, and saw in the great oak-beamed room a table
laid on the polished bare wood--a table laid for forty-eight guests, with a doily for every
plate, and every glass, and every salt-cellar, and--here the mosque fell on the heads of the
howling dervishes--forty-eight soup-spoons, forty-eight silver-handled knives and forks; forty-eight
butter-spreaders, forty-eight spoons, forty-eight salad forks, forty-eight ice-cream spoons,
forty-eight coffee spoons. Little did it avail the beleaguered party to peep slyly under the
spoon-handles--the word "Sterling" was there, and, more than that, a large, severely plain
"W" with a crest glared up at them from every piece of silver. The service had not been rented.
They knew their case was hopeless. And so they ate in peace.

When the meal was over it was Mrs. Ellen Vail Montgomery, in her thousand-dollar gown, worshipped
by the eyes of forty-eight women, who put her arm about Priscilla Winthrop and led her into
the conservatory, where they had "a dear, sweet quarter of an hour," as Mrs. Montgomery afterward
told her hostess. In that dear, sweet quarter of an hour Priscilla Winthrop Conklin unbuckled
her social sword and handed it to the conqueror, in that she agreed absolutely with Mrs. Montgomery
that Mrs. Worthington was "perfectly lovely," that she was "delighted to be of any service"
to Mrs. Worthington; that Mrs. Conklin "was sure no one else in our town was so admirably qualified
for "National Vice" as Mrs. Worthington," and that "it would be such a privilege" for Mrs.
Conklin to suggest Mrs. Worthington's name for the office. And then Mrs. Montgomery, "National
Vice" and former State Secretary for Vermont of the Colonial Dames, kissed Priscilla Winthrop
and they came forth wet-eyed and radiant, holding each other's hands. When the company had
been hushed by the magic of a State Vice and two District Virtues, Priscilla Winthrop rose
and in the sweetest Kansas Bostonese told the ladies that she thought this an eminently fitting
place to let the visiting ladies know how dearly our town esteems its most distinguished townswoman,
Mrs. Julia Neal Worthington, and that entirely without her solicitation, indeed quite without
her knowledge, the women of our town--and she hoped of our beloved State--were ready now to
announce that they were unanimous in their wish that Mrs. Worthington should be National Vice-President
of the Federation of Women's Clubs, and that she, the speaker, had entered the contest with
her whole soul to bring this end to pass. Then there was hand-clapping and handkerchief waving
and some tears, and a little good, honest Irish hugging, and in the twilight two score of women
filed down through the formal garden of Cliff Crest and walked by twos and threes into the town.

There was the usual clatter of home-going wagons; lights winked out of kitchen windows; the
tinkle of distant cow-bells was in the air; on Main Street the commerce of the town was gently
ebbing, and man and nature seemed utterly oblivious of the great event that had happened. The
course of human events was not changed; the great world rolled on, while Priscilla Winthrop
went home to a broken shrine to sit among the potsherds.

XV

"And Yet a Fool"

The exchanges that come to a country newspaper like ours become familiar friends as the years
pass. One who reads these papers regularly comes to know them even in their wrappers, though
to an unpracticed eye the wrappers seem much alike. But when he has been poking his thumb through
the paper husks in a certain pile every morning for a score of years, he knows by some sort
of prescience when a new paper appears; and, when the pile looks odd to him, he goes hunting
for the stranger and is not happy until he has found it.

One morning this spring the stranger stuck its head from the bottom of the exchange pile, and
when we had glanced at the handwriting of the address and at the one-cent stamp on the cover
we knew it had been mailed to us by someone besides the publisher. For the newspaper "hand"
is as definite a form of writing as the legal hand or the doctor's. The paper proved to be
an Arizona newspaper full of saloon advertising, restaurant cards, church and school meeting
notices, local items about the sawmill and the woman's club, land notices and paid items from
wool dealers. On the local page in the midst of a circle of red ink was the announcement of
the death of Horace P. Sampson. Every month we get notices like this, of the deaths of old
settlers who have gone to the ends of the earth, but this notice was peculiar in that it said:

"One year ago our lamented townsman deposited with the firm of Cross & Kurtz, the popular undertakers
and dealers in Indian goods and general merchandise, $100 to cover his funeral expenses, and
another hundred to provide that a huge boulder be rolled over his grave on which he desired
the following unusual inscription: 'Horace P. Sampson, Born Dec. 6, 1840, and died ----." And
is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He's good at anything and yet a fool."'"

We handed the paper to Alphabetical Morrison, who happened to be in the office at the time,
pawing through the discarded exchanges in the waste-basket, looking for his New York Sun, and,
after Colonel Morrison had read the item, he began drumming with his finger-nails on the chair-seat
between his knees. His eyes were full of dreams and no one disturbed him as he looked off into
space. Finally he sighed:

"And yet a fool--a motley fool! Poor old Samp--kept it up to the end! I take it from the guarded
way the paper refers to his faults, 'as who of us have not,' that he died of the tremens or
something like that." The Colonel paused and smiled just perceptibly, and went on: "Yet I see
that he was a good fellow to the end. I notice that the Shriners and the Elks and the Eagles
and the Hoo-hoos buried him. Nary an insurance order in his! Poor old Samp; he certainly went
all the gaits!"

We suggested that Colonel Morrison write something about the deceased for the paper, but though
the Colonel admitted that he knew Sampson "like a book," there was no persuading Morrison to
write the obituary.

"After some urging and by way of compromise," he said, "I'm perfectly willing to give you fellows
the facts and let you fix up what you please."

Because the reporters were both busy we called the stenographer, and had the Colonel's story
taken down as he told it--to be rewritten into an obituary later. And it is what he said and
not what we printed about Sampson that is worth putting down here. The Colonel took the big
leather chair, locked his hands behind his head, and began:

"Let me see. Samp was born, as he says, December 6, 1840, in Wisconsin, and came out to Kansas
right after the war closed. He was going to college up there, and at the second call for troops
he led the whole senior class into forming a company, and enlisted before graduation and fought
from that time on till the close of the war. He was a captain, I think, but you never heard
him called that. When he came here he'd been admitted to the bar and was a good lawyer--a mighty
good lawyer for that time--and had more business 'n a bird pup with a gum-shoe. He was just
a boy then, and, like all boys, he enjoyed a good time. He drank more or less in the army--they
all did 's far as that goes--but he kept it up in a desultory way after he came here, as a
sort of accessory to his main business of life, which was being a good fellow.

"And he was a good fellow--an awful good fellow. We were all young then; there wasn't an old
man on the town-site as I remember it. We use to load up the whole bunch and go hunting--closing
up the stores and taking the girls along--and did not show up till midnight. Samp would always
have a little something to take under his buggy-seat, and we would wet up and sing coming home,
with the beds of the spring-wagons so full of prairie chickens and quail that they jolted out
at every rut. Samp would always lead the singing--being just a mite more lubricated than the
rest of us, and the girls thought he was all hunkey dorey--as they used to say.

"He made a lot of money and blew it in at Jim Thomas's saloon, buying drinks, playing stud
poker, betting on quarter horses, and lending it out to fellows who helped him forget they'd
borrowed it. And--say in two or three years, after the chicken-hunting set had married off,
and begun in a way to settle down--Samp took up with the next set coming on; he married and
got the prettiest girl in town. We always thought that he married only because he wanted to
be a good fellow and did not wish to be impolite to the girl he'd paired off with in the first
crowd. Still he didn't stay home nights, and once or twice a year--say, election or Fourth
of July--he and a lot of other young fellows would go out and tip over all the board sidewalks
in town, and paint funny signs on the store buildings and stack beer bottles on the preacher's
front porch, and raise Ned generally. And the fellows of his age, who owned the stores and
were in nights, would say to Samp when they saw him coming down about noon the next day:

"'Go it when you're young Samp, for when you're old you can't.' And he would wink at 'em, give
'em ten dollars apiece for their damages and jolly his way down the street to his office.

"Now, you mustn't get the idea that Samp was the town drunkard, for he never was. He was just
a good fellow. When the second set of young fellows outgrew him and settled down, he picked
up with the third, and his wife's brown alpaca began to be noticed more or less among the women.
But Samp's practice didn't seem to fall off--it only changed. He didn't have so much real estate
lawing and got more criminal practice. Gradually he became a criminal lawyer, and his fame
for wit and eloquence extended over all the State. When a cowpuncher got in trouble his folks
in the East always gave Samp a big fee to get the boy out, and he did it. When he went to any
other county-seat besides our own to try a case, the fellows--and you know who the fellows
are in a town--the fellows knew that while Samp was in town there would be something going
on with 'fireworks in the evening.' For he was a great fellow for a good time, and the dining-room
girls at the hotel used to giggle in the kitchen for a week after he was gone at the awful
things he would say to 'em. He knew more girls by their first names than a drummer."

Colonel Morrison chuckled and crossed his fat legs at the ankles as he continued, after lighting
the cigar we gave him:

"Well, along in the late seventies we fellows that he started out with got to owning our own
homes and getting on in the world. That was the time when Samp should have been grubbing at
his law books, but nary a grub for him. He was playing horse for dear life. And right there
the fellows all left him behind. Some were buying real estate for speculation; some running
for office; some starting a bank; and others lending money at two per cent. a month, and leading
in the prayer-meeting. So Samp kind of hitched up his ambition and took the slack out of his
habits for a few months and went to the legislature. They say that he certainly did have a
good time, though, when he got there. They remember that session yet up there, and call it
the year of the great flood, for the nights they were filled with music, as the poet says,
and from the best accounts we could get the days were devoid of ease also, and how Mrs. Sampson
stood it the women never could find out, for, of course, she must have known all about it,
though he wouldn't let her come near Topeka. He began to get pursy and red-faced, and was clicking
it off with his fifth set of young fellows. It took a big slug of whisky to set off his oratory,
but when he got it wound up he surely could pull the feathers out of the bird of freedom to
beat scandalous. But as a stump speaker you weren't always sure he'd fill the engagement. He
could make a jury blubber and clench its fists at the prosecuting attorney, yet he didn't claim
to know much law, and he did turn over all the work in the Supreme Court to his partner, Charley
Hedrick. Then, when Charley was practising before the Supreme Court and wasn't here to hold
him down, Samp would get out and whoop it up with the boys, quote Shakespeare and make stump
speeches on dry-goods boxes at midnight, and put his arms around old Marshal Furgeson's neck
and tell him he was the blooming flower of chivalry. Also women made a fool of him--more or less.

"Where was I?" asked Colonel Morrison of the stenographer when she had finished sharpening
her pencil. "Oh, yes, along in the eighties came the boom, and Samp tried to get in it and
make some money. The snow was falling in thin flakes, and with great difficulty our driver could keep the track, his
jaded sinking sometimes up to the traces into castles, battlements, and towers,
which were wafted by the breeze far away from our view.

formed of houses constructed much in the same way as that previously
described, when our horses stopped before a detached cottage.

That was what Colonel Morrison gave the stenographer. What we made for the paper is entirely
uninteresting and need not be printed here.

XVI

A Kansas "Childe Roland"

One of the wisest things ever said about the newspaper business was said by the late J. Sterling
Morton, of Nebraska. He declared that a newspaper's enemies were its assets, and the newspaper's
liabilities its friends. This is particularly true of a country newspaper. For instance, witness
the ten-years' struggle of our own little paper to get rid of the word "Hon." as a prefix to
the names of politicians. Everyone in town used to laugh at us for referring to whippersnapper
statesmen as "Honourable"; because everyone in town knew that for the most part these whippersnappers
were entirely dishonourable. It was easy enough to stop calling our enemies "Hon.," for they
didn't dare to complain; but if we dropped the title even from so mangy a man as Abner Handy,
within a week Charley Hedrick would happen into the office with twenty or thirty dollars' worth
of legal printing, and after doing us so important a favour would pause before going out to say:

"Boys, what you fellows got against Ab Handy?" And the ensuing dialogue would conclude from
old Charley: "Well, I know--I know--but Ab likes it, and it really isn't much, and I know he's
a fool about it; I don't care in my own case, but if you can do it I kind of wish you would.
Ab's funny that way; he's never given up. He's like the fellow old Browning tells about who
has 'august anticipations, of a dim splendour ever on before,' and when you fellows quit calling
him 'Hon.' it makes him blue."

And old Charley would grow purple with a big, wheezy, asthmatic laugh, and shake his great
six-foot hulk and toddle out leaving us vanquished. For though the whole town reviles Abner
Handy, Charley Hedrick still looks after him.

It was said for thirty years that Handy did old Charley's dirty work in politics, but we knew
many of the mean things that Handy did were unjustly charged to Hedrick. People in a small
community are apt to put two and two together and make five. Much of the talk about the alliance
between Hedrick and Handy is, of course, down-right slander; every lawyer who tries lawsuits
for forty years in a country town is bound to make enemies of small-minded people, many of
whom occupy large places in the community, and a small-minded man, believing that his enemy
is a villain, makes up his facts to suit his belief, and then peddles his story. It is always
just as well to discount the home stories on an old lawyer ninety-five per cent. if they are
bad; and seventy per cent. if they are good--for he may have saved the fellow who is telling
them from the penitentiary. But Abner Handy was never enough of a lawyer to come within this
rule. Indeed they used to say that he was not admitted to the bar, at all, but that when he
came to town, in 1871, he erased his dead brother's name on a law diploma and substituted his
own. Still, he practised on the law--as Simon Mehronay used to say of Handy--and for twenty
years carried an advertisement in Eastern farm journals proclaiming that his specialty was
Kansas collections. He never took as a fee less than ninety-five per cent. of the amount he
collected. That was the advantage which he had as a lawyer, which advantage inspired Colonel
Alphabetical Morrison to proclaim that a lawyer's diploma is nothing but a license to steal;
upon hearing which Charley Hedrick sent back to the Colonel the retort that it would take two
legal diplomas working day and night to keep up with the Colonel's more or less honest endeavours.

Now Ab Handy was a lean coyote, who was forever licking his bruises, and some ten years later
he tried to run for the school board solely to get the Colonel's daughters dismissed as school-teachers.
It was his boast that he never forgot a foe; and for twenty years after Hedrick saved Handy
from going to jail for robbing a cattleman of a thousand dollars in "Red" Martin's gambling-room,
the only good thing the town knew of Handy was that he never forgot a friend.

During that twenty years whenever, to further his ends in a primary or in an election, Charley
Hedrick needed the votes of the rough element that gathered about our little town, Abner Handy,
card-sharper and jack-leg lawyer, would go forth into the byways and alleys and gather them
in. For this service, when Hedrick carried the county--which was about four times out of five--Handy
was rewarded by being put on the delegation to the State convention. Thus he made his beginning
in State politics. The second time that he attended a State convention Handy swelled up in
his Sunday clothes, and by reason of his slight acquaintance with the manipulators of State
politics, began to patronise the other members of our delegation--good, honest men, whose contempt
for him at home was unspeakable; but when they huddled like sheep in the strange crowd at the
convention they often accepted Handy as a guide in important matters. In talking with the home
delegation Handy very soon began speaking of the convention leaders familiarly as "Jim" and
"Dick" and "Tawm" and "Bill," and sometimes Handy brought one of these dignitaries to the rooms
of our delegation and introduced him to our people with a grand flourish. Every time the legislature
met, Ab Handy was a clerk in it, and, if he was a clerk of an important committee like the
railroad committee or the committee on the calendar, he invariably came home with a few hundred
dollars, three suits of clothes and a railroad pass. No one but Charley Hedrick could live
with him for six months afterward.

It was when he returned from one of these profitable sessions that Abner Handy and Nora Sinclair
were married. The affinity between them was this: his good clothes and proud manner caught
her; and her social position caught him. Everyone in town knew, however, that Nora Sinclair
had been too smart for Handy. She had him hooked through the gills before he knew that he was
more than nibbling at the bait. The town concurred with Colonel Morrison--our only townsman
who travelled widely in those days--when he put it succinctly: "Ab Handy is Nora Sinclair's
last call for the dining-car."

Her influence on Abner Handy and his life was such that it is necessary to record something
of the kind of a woman she was before he met her. A woman of the right sort might have made
a man of Handy, even that late in life. Strong, good women have made weak men fairly strong,
but such women were never girls like Nora. She was a nice enough little girl until she became
boy-struck--as our vernacular puts it. Her mother thought this development of the child was
"so cute," and told callers about the boys who came to see Nora--before she was twelve. In
those days, and in some old-fashioned families in our town, little girls were asked to run
out to play when the neighbours had to be discussed. But Mrs. Sinclair claimed Nora was "neither
sugar nor salt nor anybody's honey," and everything was talked over before the child. We knew
at the office from Colonel Morrison that his little girls did not play at the Sinclairs'. Her
mother put long dresses and picture hats upon her and pushed her out into society, and the
whole town knew that Nora was a mature woman, in all her instincts, by the time she was sixteen.
Her mother, moreover, was manifestly proud that the child wasn't "one of those long-legged,
gangling tom-boy girls, who seem so backward" and wear pigtails and chew slate pencils and dream.

The gilded youths who boarded at the Hotel Metropole began to notice her. That pleased her
mother also, and she said to the mothers of other little girls of Nora's age who were climbing
fences and wiping dishes: "You know Nora is so popular with the gentlemen." When the girl was
seventeen she was engaged. She kept a town fellow and had a college fellow. She acquired a
"gentleman friend" in Kansas City who gave her expensive presents. These her mother took great
joy in displaying, and never objected when he stayed after eleven o'clock; for she thought
he was "such a good catch" and such a "swell young man." But Nora shooed him off the front
porch in the summer following, because he objected to her having two or three other eleven
o'clock fellows. She said he was "selfish, and would not let her have a good time." At nineteen
she knew more about matters that were none of her business than most women know on their wedding
day, and the boys said that she was soft. Every time that Nora left town she came back with
two or three correspondents. She perfumed her stationery, used a seal, adopted all the latest
frills, and learned to write an angular hand. At twenty she was going with the young married
set, and was invited out to the afternoon card clubs. She was known as a dashing girl at this
time, and travelling men in three States knew about her. Her mother used to send personal items
to our office telling of their exalted business positions and announcing their visits to the
Sinclair home. There was more or less talk about Nora in a quiet way, but her mother said that
"it is because the other girls don't know how to wear their clothes as well as Nora does,"
and that "when a girl has a fine figure--which few enough girls in this town have, Heaven knows--why,
she is a fool if she doesn't make the most of herself."

Then, gradually, Nora went to seed. She became a faded, hard-faced woman, and all the sisters
in town warned their brothers against her. She was invited out only when there was a crowd.
She took up with the boys of the younger set, and the married women of her own age called her
the kidnapper. She was a social joke. About once a year a strange man would show up in her
parlour, and she kept up the illusion about being engaged. But in the office we shared the
town's knowledge that her harp was on the willows. She was massaging her face at twenty-six
and her mother was sniffing at the town and saying that there were no social advantages to
be had here. She and the girl went to the Lakes every summer, and Nora always came home declaring
that she had had the time of her life, and that she met so many lovely gentlemen. But that
was all there was to it, and in the end it was Abner Handy or no one.

After their wedding, Nora and Abner Handy set about the business of making politics pay. That
is a difficult thing to do in a country town, where every voter is a watchdog of the county
and city treasuries. Abner gave up his gambling, he and his wife joined all the lodges in town,
and she dragged him into that coterie of people known as Society. She joined a woman's club,
and was always anxious to be appointed on the soliciting committee when the women had any public
work to do; so when the library needed books, or the trash cans at the street corners needed
paint, or the park trees needed trimming, or the new hospital needed an additional bed, or
the band needed new uniforms, Mrs. Handy might be seen on the streets with two or three women
of a much better social status than she had, making it clear that she was a public-spirited
woman and that she moved in the best circles. Whereupon Abner Handy got work in the court-house--as
a deputy, or as a clerk, or as an under-sheriff, or as a juror--and when the legislature met
he went to Topeka as a clerk.

No one knew how they lived, but they did live. Every two years they gave a series of parties,
and the splendour of these festivals made the town exclaim in one voice: "Well, how do they
do it?" But Mrs. Handy, who was steaming the wrinkles out of her face, and assuming more or
less kittenish airs in her late thirties, never offered the town an explanation. "Hers not
to answer why, hers not to make reply, hers but to do and dye" was the way Colonel Morrison
put it the day after Mrs. Handy swooped down into Main Street with a golden yellow finish on
her hair. She walked serenely between Mrs. Frelinghuysen and Mrs. Priscilla Winthrop Conklin.
They were begging for funds with which to furnish a rest room for farmers' wives. And when
they bore down on our office, Colonel Morrison folded his papers in his bosom and passed them
on the threshold as one hurrying to a fire in the roof of his own house. It was interesting
to observe, when the Federation Committee called on us that day, that Mrs. Handy did all the
talking. She was as full of airs and graces as an actress, and ogled with her glassy eyes,
and put on a sweet babyish innocence of the ways of business and of men--as though men were
a race apart, greatly to be feared because they ate up little girls. But she got her dollar
before she left the office, and George Kirwin, who happened to be in the front room at the
time waiting for a proof, said he thought that the performance and the new hair were worth
the price.

Five years passed and in each year Mrs. Handy had found some artificial way of deluding herself
that she was cheating time. Then Charley Hedrick, who needed a vote in the legislature, and
was too busy to go there himself, nominated Abner Handy and elected him to a seat in the lower
house. The thing that Hedrick needed was not important--merely the creation of a new judicial
district which would remove an obnoxious district judge in an adjoining county from our district,
and leave our county in a district by itself. Hedrick hated the judge, and Hedrick used Handy's
vote for trading purposes with other statesmen desiring similar small matters and got the district
remade as he desired it.

When the Handys started to Topeka for the opening of the session, they began to inflame with
importance as the train whistled for the junction east of town, and by the time they actually
arrived at Topeka they were so highly swollen that they could not get into a boarding-house
door, but went to the best hotel, and engaged rooms at seven dollars a day. The town gasped
for two days and then began to laugh and wink. Two weeks after their arrival at the State capital,
Abner Handy had been made chairman of the joint committee on the calendar, second member of
the judiciary committee and member of the railroad committee, and Mrs. Handy had established
credit at a Topeka dry-goods store and was going it blind. She gave her hair an extra dip,
and used to come sailing down the corridors of the hotel in gorgeous silk house-gowns with
ridiculous trains, and never appeared at breakfast without her diamonds. Before the session
was well under way she had been to Kansas City to have her face enameled and had told the other
"ladies of the hotel," as the wives of members of the legislature stopping at the hotel were
called, that Topeka stores offered such a poor selection; she confided to them that Mr. Handy
always wore silk nightshirts, and that she was unable to find anything in town that he would
put on. She regarded herself as a charmer, and made great eyes at all the important lobbyists,
to whom she put on her baby voice and manner and said that she thought politics were just simply
awful, and added that if she were a man she would show them how honest a politician could be,
but she wasn't, and when Abner tried to explain it to her it made her head ache, and all she
wanted him to do was to help his friends, and she would add coyly: "I'm going to see that he
helps you--whatever he does."

Every bill that had a dollar in it was held at the bottom of the calendar until satisfactory
arrangements were made with Abner Handy and his friends. When the legislative buccaneers under
the black flag, sailed after an insurance company, their bill remained at the bottom of the
calendar in one house or the other until Ab Handy had been seen, and no one could find out
why. And so, in spite of our dislike of the man, our paper was forced to acknowledge that Handy
was a house leader. Although he had never had a dozen cases above the police court, he came
back at the end of the session with the local attorneyship of two railroads, and was chairman
of a house committee to investigate the taxes paid by the railroads in the various counties.
This gave him a year's work, so he rented an office in the Worthington block and hired a stenographer.
Of course, we knew in town how Ab Handy had made his money. But he paid so many of his old
debts, and dispensed so many favours with such a lordly hand, that it was hard to stir local
sentiment against him. He donned the clothes of a "prominent citizen," and in discussing public
affairs assumed an owlish manner that impressed his former associates, and fooled stupid people,
who began to believe that they had been harbouring a statesman unawares. But Charley Hedrick
only grinned when men talked to him of the rise of Handy, and replied to the complaints of
the scrupulous that Ab was no worse than he had always been, and if he was making it pay better,
no one was poorer for his prosperity but Ab himself, and added: "Certainly he is a sincere
spender." One day when Handy appeared on the street in a particularly fiery red necktie, Hedrick
got him in a crowd, and began: "Just for a handful of silver he left us--just for a riband
to stick in his coat." And when the crowd laughed with the joker, Hedrick continued in his
thick, gravy-coated voice: "Old Browning's the boy. You fellows that want Shakespeare can have
him; but Ab here knows that I take a little dash of Browning in mine. Since Ab's got to be
a statesman, he's bought all of Webster's works and is learning 'em by heart. But"--and here
Hedrick chuckled and shook his fat sides before letting out the joke which he enjoyed so much--"I
says to Ab: as old Browning says, what does 'the fine felicity and flower of wickedness' like
you need with Webster; what you want to commit to memory is the penal statutes." And he threw
back his head and gurgled down in his abdomen, while the crowd roared and Handy showed the
wool in his teeth with a dog-like grin.

No other man in town would have dared that with Handy after he became a statesman; but we figured
it out in the office that old Charley Hedrick was merely exhibiting his brand on Ab Handy to
show the town that his title to Handy was still good. For though there was considerable of
the King Cole about Hedrick--in that he was a merry old soul--he was always king, and he insisted
on having his divine right to rule the politics of the county unquestioned. That was his vanity
and he knew it, and was not ashamed of it.

He was the best lawyer in the State in those days, and one of the best in the West. Ten months
in the year he paid no attention to politics, pendulating daily between his house and his office.
Often, being preoccupied with his work, he would go the whole length of Main Street speaking
to no one. When a tangled case was in his mind he would enter his office in the morning, roll
up his desk top, and dig into his work without speaking to a soul until, about the middle of
the morning, he would look up from his desk to say as though he had just left off speaking:
"Jim, hand me that 32 Kansas report over there on the table." When he worked, law books sprang
up around him and sprawled over his desk and lay half open on chairs and tables near him until
he had found his point; then he would get up and begin rollicking, slamming books together,
cleaning up his debris and playing like a great porpoise with the litter he had made. At such
times--and, indeed, all the time unless he was in what he called a "legal trance"--Hedrick
was bubbling with good spirits, and when he left his office for politics he could get out in
his shirt-sleeves at a primary and peddle tickets, or nose up and down the street like a fat
ferret looking for votes. So when Abner Handy announced that he desired to go to the State
Senate, to fill an unexpired term for two years, he had Hedrick behind him to give strength
and respectability to his candidacy. Between the two Handy won. That was before the days of
reform, when it was supposed to be considerable of a virtue for a man to stand by his friend;
and, being a lawyer, Hedrick naturally had the lawyer's view that no man is guilty until the
jury is in, and its findings have been reviewed by the supreme court.

So Senator and Mrs. Senator Handy--as the town put it--went to Topeka as grandly as ever "Childe
Roland to the dark tower came"--to use Hedrick's language. "No one ever has been able to find
out what Roland was up to when he went to the dark tower, but," continued Hedrick, "with Ab
and his child-wonder it will be different. She isn't taking all that special scenery along
in her trunks for nothing. Ab has stumbled on to this great truth--that clothes may not make
the man, but they make the crook!"

Handy drew a dark brow when he became a Senator, and made a point of trying to look ominous.
He carried his chin tilted up at an angle of forty-five degrees, and spoke of the most obvious
things with an air of mystery. He never admitted anything; his closest approach to committing
himself on even so apparent a proposition as the sunrise, was that it had risen "ostensibly";
he became known to the reporters as "Old Ostensible."

It was his habit to tiptoe around the Senate chamber whispering to other Senators, and then
having sat down to rise suddenly as though some great impulse had come to him and hurry into
the cloakroom. He inherited the chairmanship of the railroad committee, and all employees came
to him for their railroad passes; so he was the god of the blue-bottle flies of politics that
feed on legislatures, and buzz pompously about the capitol doing nothing, at three dollars
a day. In that session Handy was for the "peepul." He patronised the State Shippers' Association,
and told their committee that he would give them a better railroad bill than they were asking.
His practice was to commit to memory a bill that he was about to introduce and then go into
his committee-room, when it was full of loafers, and pretend to dictate it offhand to the stenographer,
section by section without pausing. It was an impressive performance, and gained Handy the
reputation of being brainy. But we at home who knew Handy were not impressed; and, in our office,
we knew that he was the same Ab Handy who once did business with a marked deck; who cheated
widows and orphans; who sold bogus bonds; who got on two sides of lawsuits, and whose note
was never good at any bank unless backed by blackmail.

When the session closed Abner Handy came home, a statesman with views on the tariff, and ostentatiously
displayed his thousand-dollar bills. The Handys spent the summer in Atlantic City, and Abner
came home wearing New York clothes of an exaggerated type, and though he never showed it in
our town, they used to say that he put on a high hat when the train whistled for Topeka. Also
we heard that the first time Mrs. Handy appeared at the political hotel in her New York regalia,
adorned with spangles and beads and cords and tassels, the "ladies of the hotel" said that
she was "fixed up like a Christmas tree"--a remark that we in the office coupled with Colonel
Morrison's reflection when he spoke of Ab's "illustrated vests." At the meeting of the State
Federation of Woman's Clubs, Mrs. Handy first flourished her lorgnette, and came home with
her wedding ring made over on a pattern after the prevailing style. About this time she made
her famous remark to "Aunt" Martha Merrifield that she didn't think it proper for a woman to
go through her husband's money with too sensitive a nose; she said that men must work and women
must weep, and that she for one would not make the work of her husband any harder by criticising
it with her silly morals.

As for Abner Handy, it would have made little difference to him then whether she or anyone
else had tried to check his career; for he was cultivating a loud tone of voice and a regal
sweep to his arms. He always signed himself on hotel registers Senator Handy, and the help
about the Topeka hotels began to mark him for their hate, for he was insolent to those whom
he regarded as his inferiors. But Colonel Morrison used to say that he wore his vest-buttons
off crawling to those in authority. He took little notice of the town. He referred to us as
"his people" in a fine feudal way, and went about town with his cigar pointing toward his hat
brim and his eyes fixed on something in the next block. He became the attorney for a number
of crooked promotion schemes, and the diamond rings on his wife's fingers crowded the second
joint. He had telegraph and express franks, railway and Pullman passes in such quantities that
it made his coat pocket bulge to carry them. Often he would spread out these evidences of his
shame on his office table, to awe the local politicians, and in so far as they could influence
the town opinion, they promulgated the idea that if Ab Handy was a scoundrel--and of course
he was--he was a smart scoundrel. So he came to think this himself.

Mrs. Handy threw herself into the work of the City Federation with passionate zeal. Also she
kept up her lodge connections, and explained to the women, whom she considered of a higher
social caste than the lodge women, that she was "doing it to help Mr. Handy." She did a little
church work for the same reason, but her soul was in the Federation, for it insured her social
status as neither lodge nor church could do. So she put herself under the protecting seal-lined
wing of Mrs. Julia Neal Worthington who on account of her efforts to clean the streets we at
the office had been taught by Colonel Morrison to know as the Joan of the trash-cans. And Miss
Larrabee, our society reporter, told us that Mrs. Handy was the only woman in town who did
not smile into her handkerchief when Mrs. Worthington, who had trained down to one hundred
and ninety-seven pounds five and three-eighths ounces, gave her course of lectures on delsarte
before the Federation.

It was Mrs. Handy who encouraged Mrs. Worthington to open her salon. But as there were lodge
meetings the first three nights in the week, and prayer-meetings in the middle of the week,
and as the choirs met for practice, and the whist clubs met for business the last of the week,
the salon did not seem to take with the town, and so was discontinued. Then Mrs. Worthington
and Mrs. Handy sought other fields. And the first field they stumbled into was the court-house
square. For fifty years the farmers near our town had been hitching at the racks provided by
the county commissioners. But Mrs. Worthington decided that the time had come for a change
and that the town was getting large enough to take down the hitching-racks. So, as chairman
of the Municipal Improvement section of the City Federation, Mrs. Worthington began war on
the hitching-racks. At the Federation meetings for three months there were reports from committees
appointed to interview the councilmen; reports of committees to interview the county commissioners--who
were obdurate; reports of committees to lease new ground for the hitching rack stands; reports
of the legal committee; reports of the sanitary committee, and through it all Mrs. Worthington
rose at every meeting and declared that the hitching racks must be destroyed. And as she was
rated in Bradstreet's report at nearly half a million dollars, her words had much force.

The town was beginning to stir itself. The merchants were with the women--because the women
bought the dry goods and groceries--and we forgot about the farmers. To all this milling among
the people Handy was oblivious, for he was stepping like a hen in high oats, with his eyes
on a seat in Congress. Matters of mere local importance did not concern him. The railroads
were for him, and the stars in their courses seemed to him to be pointing his way to Washington.
He knew of the hitching-rack trouble only when he had to go with Mrs. Handy to the dinners
at the Worthington home given to the councilmen and their wives, who were lukewarm on the removal
proposition.

In the spring before the election of 1902 Mrs. Worthington had a majority in the council, and
one Saturday night the hitching-racks were taken down by the street commissioner. And within
a week the town was on the verge of civil war, for the farmers of the county rose as one man
and demanded the blood of the offenders. But Abner Handy knew nothing of the disturbance. The
county attorney had the street commissioner and his men arrested for trespassing upon county
property; farmers threatened to boycott the town. But Abner Handy's ear was attuned to higher
things. Merchants who had signed the petition asking the council to remove the racks began
to denounce the removal as an act of treason. But Abner Handy conferred with State leaders
on great questions, and the city attorney, who was a candidate for county attorney that fall,
did not dare to defend the street commissioner. The council got stubborn, and Colonel Morrison,
before whom as justice of the peace the case was to be tried, fearing for the professional
safety of his three daughters in the town schools and his four daughters in the county schools,
took a trip to his wife's people, and told us he was enlisted there for "ninety days or during
the war"; and still Abner Handy looked at the green hills afar.

We are generally accounted by ourselves a fearless newspaper; but here we admitted that the
situation required discretion. So we straddled it. We wrote cautious editorials in carefully-balanced
sentences demanding that the people keep cool. We advised both sides to realise that only good
sense and judgment would straighten out the tangle. We demanded that each side recognise the
other's rights and made both sides angry, whereas General Durham, of the Statesman, made his
first popular stroke in a dozen years by insisting, in double leads and italics, that the tariff
on hides was a divine institution, and that humanity called upon us to hold the Philippines.
Charley Hedrick knew better than anyone else in town what a tempest was rising. He might have
warned Handy, but he did not; for Handy had reached a point in his career where he considered
that a mere county boss was beneath his confidence. More than that, Hedrick had refused to
indorse Handy's note at the bank. Handy needed money, and being a shorn lamb, the wind changed
in his direction in this wise:

In the midst of the furore that week, Mrs. Worthington gave an evening reception for the Federation
and its husbands at her mansion, fed them sumptuously, and, after Mrs. Handy had tapped a bell
for silence, Mrs. Worthington rose in her jet and passementerie and announced that our town
had come to a crisis in its career; that we must now decide whether we were going to be a beautiful
little city or a cow pasture. She said that beauty was as much an essential to life as money
and that we would be better off with more beauty and less trade, and that with the court-house
square a mudhole the town could never rise to any real consequence. As the men of the town
seemed to be moral cowards, she was going to enlist the women in this war, and as the first
step in her campaign she proposed to hire the Honourable Abner Handy to assist the city attorney
in fighting this case, and as a retainer she would herewith and now hand him her personal check
for five hundred dollars. Whereat the women clapped their hands, their husbands winked at one
another, and "there was a sound of revelry by night." The check was put on a silver card-tray
by Mrs. Worthington and set on a table in the midst of the company waiting for Handy to come
forward and take it. After the town had looked at the check, Mrs. Handy seemed to cut his leashes
and Abner went after it. He was waiting at the Worthington bank the next morning at nine o'clock
to cash it--and all the town saw that also.

Whereupon the town grinned broadly that evening when it read in the Statesman a most laudatory
article about "our distinguished fellow-townsman." The article declared that it was "the duty
of the hour to send Honourable Abner Handy to the halls of Congress." The Statesman contended
that "Judge Handy had been for a lifetime the defender of those grand and glorious principles
of freedom and protection and sound money for which the Grand Old Party stood." The General
proclaimed that "it shall be not only a duty, but a pleasure, for our citizens to lay aside
all petty personal and factional quarrels and rally round the standard of our noble leader
in this great contest."

If Handy ever went to the city attorney's office to look after Mrs. Worthington's lawsuit,
no one knew it. He smiled wisely when asked how the suit was progressing, and one day John
Markley--who during the life of Ezra Worthington, hated him with a ten-horse-power hate and
loaded it onto his widow's shoulders and the Worthington bank which she inherited--John Markley
called Handy into the back room of the Markley Mortgage Company, and, when Handy passed the
cashier's window going out, he cashed a check signed by John Markley for a thousand dollars
on which was inscribed "for legal services in assisting the county attorney in the hitching
rack case."

Handy had arrived at a point where he feared nothing. He seemed to believe that he lived a
charmed life and never would get caught. He bought extra copies of the Statesman, which was
booming him for Congress, and sent them over the Congressional District by the thousands. He
went to Topeka in his high silk hat and his New York clothes, gave out interviews on the causes
of the flurry in the money market, and, desiring further advertisement, gave a banquet for
the newspaper men of the capital which cost him a hundred dollars. So he became a great man.
At home he assumed a patronising air to the people about Charley Hedrick. And one night in
Smith's cigar store, just to be talking, he said that he didn't get so much of Mrs. Worthington's
money as people thought, for part of it had to go to "square old Charley Hedrick." Hedrick
was John Markley's attorney, and he had taken an active part in helping the county attorney
prosecute the street commissioners. Naturally Handy's remark stirred up the town. It was two
weeks, however, in getting to Hedrick, and when it came the man turned black and seemed to
be swallowing a pint of emotional language before he spoke. And there Abner Handy's doom was
sealed; though Hedrick did not make the sentence public.

Now, it is well known in our county that the country people are slow to wrath. They were two
months finding out beyond a question of doubt that Abner Handy had accepted Mrs. Worthington's
money to act against them, but when they knew this there was no hope for Handy among them.
They are a quiet people, and make no noise. For a month, only Charley Hedrick and the grocers
and the hardware men, with whom the farmers trade, knew the truth about Handy's standing in
the county. Hedrick bided his time. The Handy boom for Congress was rolling over the district,
and the Statesman italics were becoming worn, and its exclamation points battered in the service,
when one day Handy stalked up to Hedrick's office, imperiously beckoned Hedrick into the private
room, and blurted out:

"Charley, I got to have some more money--need it in my business. Can't you touch old John Markley
for me again--say for about five hundred on that hitching rack case? Sister Worthington is
kind of wanting me to get action on her case."

Hedrick was dumb with rage, but Handy thought it was acquiescence. He went on:

"You just step down to the bank and say: 'John, I've noticed Ab Handy actin' kind of queer
about that hitching rack case.' That's all you need say, and pretty soon I'll step in and say:
'John, I don't see how I can help doin' something for Aunt Julia Worthington.' And I believe
I can tap him for five hundred more easy enough. I got an idea he is mightily in earnest about
beating her in that suit."

When Hedrick got his breath, which was churning and wheezing in his throat, he cut Handy's
sentence off with:

"You human razor-back shoat--you swill-barrel gladiator, why--why--I--I----" And Hedrick sparred
for wind and went on before Handy realised the situation. "Ab Handy, I spat on the dust and
breathed into the chaff that made you, and put you on the mud-sills of hell to dry, and I've
got a right to turn you back into fertiliser, and I'm going to do it. Git out of here--git
out of this office, or I----"

And the hulking form of Hedrick fell on the bag of shaking bones that was Handy and battered
him through the latched door into the crowded outer office; and Handy picked himself up and
ran like a wolf, turning at the door to show his teeth before he scampered through the hall
and scurried down the stairs. As Hedrick came puffing out of the broken door his coat snagged
on a splinter. He grinned as he unfastened himself:

"Well, the snail seems to be on the thorn; the lark certainly is on the wing.

    "God's in his heaven.
      All's right with the world!"

And he batted his eyes at the group of loafing local statesmen in his office as he viewed the
wreckage, and went to the telephone and ordered a carpenter, without wasting any words on the
crowd.

We decided long ago that the source of Hedrick's power in politics was what we called his "do
it now" policy. All politicians have schemes. Hedrick puts his through before he talks about
them. If he has an idea that satisfies his judgment, he makes it a reality in the quickest
possible time. That is why the fellows around town who hate Hedrick call him the rattlesnake,
and those who admire him call him the Wrath of God. When he put up the telephone receiver he
reached for his hat and bolted from the office under a full head of steam. He went directly
to John Markley's back office, got the check that Markley had given to Handy, dictated a letter
in the anteroom of Markley's office to a Kansas City plate-maker, inclosed fifty dollars as
he passed the draft counter, and, as he swung by the post-office he mailed the Handy check
with instructions to have ten photographic half-tone cuts made of the check and mailed back
to Hedrick in four days.

Then he went to Mrs. Worthington, told her his story, as a lawyer puts his case before a jury--had
her raging at Ab Handy--and got an order on the bank for the check she had given to Handy.
This also he sent to the plate-maker, and in an hour was back at his desk dictating a half-page
advertisement to go into every Republican weekly newspaper in the district. He sent that advertisement
out with the half-tone cuts Monday morning, and it appeared all over the district that week.
The advertisement was signed by Hedrick, and began:

"Browning has a poem made after visiting a dead house, and in it he describes the corpse of
a suicide, and says 'one clear, nice, cool squirt of water o'er the bust,' is the 'right thing
to extinguish lust.' And I desire this advertisement to be 'one clear, nice, cool squirt of
water' over the political remains of Honourable Abner Handy, to extinguish if possible his
fatal lust for crooked money." After this followed the story of Handy's perfidy in the hitching
rack case, a petition in disbarment proceedings, and the copy of the warrant for his arrest
charged with a felony in the case sworn to by Hedrick himself. But the effective thing was
the pictures, showing both sides of the two checks, each carefully inscribed by the two makers
"for legal services in the hitching rack case," and each check indorsed by Handy in his big,
brazen signature.

Hedrick saw to it also that, on the day the country papers printed his advertisement, the Kansas
City and Topeka papers printed the whole story, including the casting out of Handy from Hedrick's
office. It did Handy little good to go to Topeka in his flashy clothes and give out a festive
interview asking his friends to suspend judgment, and saying that he would try his case in
the courts and not in the newspapers. It was contended by the newspapers that if Handy had
an honest defence, it would lose no weight in court by being printed in the newspapers; and
his enemies in the Congressional fight pushed the charges against Handy so relentlessly that
the public faith in him melted like an April snow, and when the delegates to the Congressional
convention were named, our own county instructed its delegates against Handy. The farmers opposed
him for taking the case against them, and the town scorned him for his perfidy. No one who
was not paid for it would peddle his tickets at the primaries, so Handy, with his money all
spent, went home on the night of the local primaries a whipped dog. They said around town that
all the whipped dog got at home was a tin can; for it is certain that at daylight Handy was
down on Main Street viciously drunk, flourishing a revolver with which he said he was going
to kill Charley Hedrick and then himself. The initial and preliminary question as to the right of the
Christian Church to send forth its missionaries, and to establish
its missions in heathen lands.

This question is now raised by many. They ask it because they believe
a natural evolution of their own faiths? Let those old crude religions
pass into something higher in the integrity of the doctrine of evolution.“
Why do you not,” they say,“ leave those non- Christian peoples to
work out their own salvation through through the natural process of
evolution rather than resort to the cataclysmic method of over- throwing
the and old and introducing a faith that is entirely foreign.

Why not let Lord to His followers—
to go message of evolution to us at this present? And the process of
growth work out its own even though it takes a long time for are brought
to all the benighted souls of. Of it is equally pronounced against supernaturalism
in all its forms and ramifications. It would be the futile to reply
to this by appealing to the command of our Lord to go and disciple
all nations. it?” This objection to our work is modern and thoroughgoing
Christian altruism which will not rest until the noblest truth and
the fullest life It is enough to remind this dissenter that the doctrine
of evolution admits that the highest altruism is a part of the evolution
process.

And if that is so, then the highest Christian altruism must find its noblest exercise in the work
of, by Christians to non- Christians, those ideas and that life which they deem the best and of which
those outside of Christ stand in urgent need. The highest evolution of our race has been, and ever must
be, through that our race. Is not this the last last commission of our is it not identical with the
and disciple the nations?
 The man was breathing audibly, and seemed to
be struggling with a great passion. Hedrick and Handy had not spoken since they came through
the panels of the door together, but Hedrick went to the miserable creature, touched him gently
on the shoulder, and motioned him into the private office. There, with his eyes still on the
floor, Handy told Hedrick that the end of the rope had been reached.

"I had to come down without any breakfast this morning--because--they--they ain't anything
in the house for her to fix. And there ain't any show for dinner. Next week, Red Martin has
promised me some money he's goin' to get from Jim Huddleson; but they ain't a soul in town
but you I can come to now"; and Handy raised his eyes from the floor in canine self-pity as
he whined--"and she's making life a hell for me!" When Hedrick opened his desk and got out
his check-book, he smiled as he fancied he could detect about Handy's body the faint resemblance
of a wagging tail. He made the check for fifty dollars and gave it to Handy saying, "Oh, well,
Ab--we'll let bygones be bygones."

Handy snapped at it and in an instant was gone.

That afternoon Hedrick met Handy sailing down Main Street in his old manner. His head was erect,
his eyes were sparkling, his big, rough, statesman's voice was bellowing abroad, and his thumbs
were in the armholes of his vest. He walked straight to Hedrick and led him by the coat lapel
into a dark stairway. There was an air of deep mystery about Handy and when he put his arm
on Hedrick to whisper in his ear, Hedrick, smelling the statesman's breath heavy with whiskey
and onions and cloves and cardamon seeds and pungent gum, heard this:

"Say, Charley, I'm fooling 'em--I've got 'em all fooled. They think I'm poor. They think I
ain't got any money. But old Ab's too smart for them. I've got lots of money--all I want--all
anyone could want--wealth beyond the dreams of avar--of av--avar--avar'ce, as John Ingalls
used to say. Just look at this!" And with that Handy pulled from his inside coat pocket a roll
of one and two-dollar bills, that seemed to Hedrick to represent fifty dollars less the price
of about ten drinks. "Look a-here," continued Handy, "ol' Ab's got 'em all fooled. Don't you
say anything about it; but ol' Ab's goin' to make his mark." And he shook Hedrick's hand and
took him down to the street, and shook it again and again before prancing grandly down the
sidewalk.

For three years Mrs. Handy's boarding-house has been one of the most exclusive in our town.
They say that she pays Mr. Handy for mowing the lawn and helping about the rough work in the
kitchen, and that he sleeps in the barn and pays her for such meals as he eats. Sometimes a
new boarder makes the mistake of paying the board money to Handy, and he appears on Main Street
ostentatiously jingling his silver and toward evening has ideas about the railroad situation.
On election days and when there is a primary Handy drives a carriage and gathers up his cronies
in the fifth ward, who, like him, are not so much in evidence as they were ten years ago.

It was only last week that Hedrick was in our office telling us of Handy's "wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice." He paused when he had finished the story, cocked his head on one side,
and squinted at the ceiling as he said:

"For three long, weary, fruitless years I've searched the drug-stores of this town for the
brand of liquor Ab had that day. I believe if I had two drinks of that I could write better
poetry than old Browning himself."

Whereupon Hedrick shook himself out of the office in a gentle wheesy laugh.

The Tremolo Stop

Our business has changed greatly since Horace Greeley's day. And, although machines have come
into little offices like ours, the greatest changes have come in the men who do the work in
these offices. In the old days--the days before the great war and after it--printers and editors
were rarely leading citizens in the community. The editor and the printer were just coming
out of the wandering minstrel stage of social development, and the journeyman who went from
town to town seeking work, and increasing his skill, was an important factor in the craft.
One might always depend upon a tramp printer's coming in when there was a rush of work in the
office, and also figure on one of the tourists in the office leaving when he was needed most.

From the ranks of this wayward class came the old editors and reporters; they were postgraduates
from the back room of newspaper offices and they brought to the front room their easy view
of life. Some of these itinerant writing craftsmen had professional fame. There was Peter B.
Lee, who had tramped the country over, who knew Greeley and Dana and Prentice and Bob Burdett
and Henry Watterson, and to whom the cub in country offices looked with worshipful eyes. There
was "Old Slugs"--the printer who carried his moulds for making lead slugs, and who, under the
influence of improper stimulants, could recite stirring scenes from the tragedies of Shakespeare.
There was Buzby--old Buzby, who went about from office to office leaving his obituary set up
by his own hand, conveying the impression that at last the end had come to a misspent life.
Then there was J. N. Free--the "Immortal J. N.," as he called himself, a gaunt, cadaverous
figure in broad hat and linen duster, with hair flowing over his shoulders, who stalked into
the offices at unseemly hours to "raise the veil" of ignorance and error, and "relieve the
pressure" of psychic congestion in a town by turning upon it the batteries of his mind.

They were a dear lot of old souls out of accord with the world about them, ever seeking the
place where they would harmonise. They might have stepped out of Dickens's books or Cruikshank's
pictures, and, when one recalls them now, their lineaments seem out of drawing and impossible
in the modern world. And yet they did live and move in the world that was, and the other day
when we were looking over the files we came across the work of Simon Mehronay,--the name which
he said was spelled Dutch and sounded Irish,--and it does not seem fair to set down the stories
of the others who have made our office traditions without giving some account of him.

For to us he was the most precious of all the old tribe of journalistic aborigines. He came
to the office one bright April day with red mud on his shoes that was not the mud of our river
bottoms, and we knew that he had ridden to town "blind baggage"--as they say of men who steal
their way--from the South. The season was ripe for the birds to come North and it was the mud
of Texas that clung to him. His greeting as he strode through the front room not waiting for
a reply was "How's work?" And when the foreman told him to hang up his coat, he found a stick,
got a "chunk of copy," and was clicking away at his case three minutes from the time he darkened
the threshold of the office. 

It will have to be amended from time to time as we receive further
information on the subject."

The specifications to above were modified and presented at the Meeting
in Supplement to Bulletin No. 121, of March, 1910, and in this final
form are attached hereto.

These specifications do not represent the work of any one Society or the work of, but are the result
of all the work of the, as the members of all are so interwoven that whatever work is done
in any one Society, or by the Committee of a Society, has very naturally
and fortunately been carried into the others. At the Chicago Meeting these
specifications were accepted without a single change, and this is
when very unusual followed and shows These rails entirely annihilated

furnace and mill."

The results so how specifically acceptable they were, of the A. R.

a view of determining the the relative merits of the respective sections.
far obtained from the heavy round, will give us valuable data to

of all Rail Committees were present at the Meeting.

The main points this specification were discussed and agreed upon by the members of the Committee and
the Rail Committee of the manufacturers who have co- operated with
them county in this work.

In the matter of Rail Sections, the Rail Committee of The American
Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association has not arrived
at any definite conclusions.

The new sections
A" and" B" of The American Railway Association have not given as
good results as was expected of them, and the the whole matter is
yet.

This year, several roads have laid then A. R. A. of rail, but under
consideration.

The Committee reported as follows:[ D]" The instructions of the American
Railway Association require us to resurvey the A. R. A. sections'

the statistics for rail failures for six months from October 31,
1908, to April 30, 1909, as reported to the Committee.

These statistics do show that the difference in section can be aid
us in coming to a final conclusion."


"Mr. Keene's Hamlet is not so familiar to our people as his Richard III., but it gave great
satisfaction; for it is certainly a Methodist Hamlet from the clang of the gong to the home-stretch.
The town never has stood for Mr. Lawrence Barrett's Unitarian Hamlet, and the high church Episcopal
Hamlet put on the boards last winter by Mr. Frederick Paulding was distinctly disappointing.
One of the most searching scenes in the play was enacted when Ophelia got the power and had
to be carried out to the pump. The Chicago brother who plays the ghost has a great voice for
his work. He brought many souls to a realizing sense that they are sin-stricken and hair-hung
over the fiery pit. The groans and amens from the sanctified in the audience were a delicate
compliment to his histrionic ability. The queen seems to have been a Presbyterian, and the
king a Second Day Adventist of an argumentative type. And they were not popular with the audience,
but the boy preacher who did Laertes was exceedingly blessed with the gift of tongues. Brother
Polonius seems to have been a sort of presiding elder, and, when his exhortation rose, the
chickens in Mike Wessner's coop, in the meat-market downstairs, gave up hope of life and lay
down to be cut up and fried for breakfast. The performance was a great treat and, barring the
fact that some switchmen, thinking Ophelia was full, giggled during the mad scene, and the
further fact that someone yelled, 'Go for his wind, Ham!' during the fencing scene, the evening
with Shakespeare's weirdest hero was a distinct credit to Mr. Keene, his company and our people."

We wrote a conventional report of the performance, and printed Mehronay's account below it,
under the caption FROM ANOTHER REPORTER, and it made the paper talked about for a week. Now
in our town Keene was a histrionic god of the first order, and so many church people came to
the office to "stop the paper" that circulation had a real impetus. We have never had a boom
in subscription that did not begin with a lot of angry citizens coming in to stop the paper.
It became known about town who wrote the Keene article, and Mehronay became in a small way
a public character. We encouraged him to write more, so every morning the first proof slips
that came in began to have on them ten or a dozen short items of Mehronay's writing. There
was a smile in every one of them, and if he wrote more than ten lines there was a laugh. It
was Mehronay who referred to Huddleson's livery-stable joint--where the old soaks got their
beer in a stall and salted it from the feed-box--as "a gilded palace of sin." It was Mehronay
who wrote the advertisement of the Chinese laundryman and signed his name "Fat Sam Child of
the Sun, Brother of the Moon and Second Cousin by marriage to all the Stars." It was Mehronay
who took a galley of pi which the office devil had set up from a wrecked form, and interspersed
up and down the column of meaningless letters "Great applause"--"Tremendous cheering"--Cries
of "Good, good!--that's the way to hit 'em!"--"Hurrah for Hancock"--and ran it in the paper
as a report of Carl Schurz's speech to the German-American League at the court-house. It was
Mehronay who put the advertisement in the paper proclaiming the fact that General Durham of
the Statesman office desired to purchase a good second-hand fiddle, and explaining that the
owner must play five tunes on it in front of the Statesman office door before bringing it in.
Mehronay originated the fiction that there was an association in town formed to insure its
members against wedding invitations which, in case of loss, paid the afflicted member a pickle
dish or a napkin ring, to present as his offering to the bride.

Mehronay started a mythical Widowers' Protective Foot-racing Society, and the town had great
sport with the old boys whose names he used so wittily that it transcended impudence. Mehronay
got up a long list of husbands who wiped dishes when the family was "out of a girl," as our
people say, and organised them into a union to strike for their altars and their kitchen fires.
When we sent him out to write up a fire, however, he generally forgot the amount of insurance
and the extent of the loss, but he told all about the way the crowd tried to boss the fire
department; and if we sent him out to gather the local markets, he made such a mess of it that
we were a week straightening matters up. Figures didn't mean anything to Mehronay. When the
bank failed, he tried to write something about it, but mixed the assets and the liabilities
so hopelessly that we had to keep him busy with other things, so that he would have no time
to touch the bank story. They used to say around town that when he laid down a piece of money,
however large, on a store counter he never waited for his change, but be it said to the credit
of most of the merchants that they would save it for Mehronay and give it to him on his next
visit to the store, when he would be as joyful as a child.

Gradually he left the back room and became a fixture in the front office. He wrote locals and
editorials and helped with the advertising, drawing for this the munificent salary of fifteen
dollars a week, which should have kept him like a prince; but it did not--though what he did
with his money no one knew. He bought no new clothes, and never buttoned those he had. Before
sending him out on the street in the morning, someone in the office had to button him up, and
if it was a gala day--say circus day, or the day of a big political pow-wow--we had to put
a clean paper collar on Mehronay above his brown wool shirt and shove out the dents in his
derby hat--a procedure which he called "making a butterfly of fashion out of an honest workin'
man." He slept in the press-room, on a bed which he rolled up and stowed behind the press by
day, and in the evening he consorted with the goddess of nicotine--as he called his plug tobacco--and
put in his time at his desk with a lead pencil and a pad of white paper writing copy for the
next day's issue. Nothing delighted him so much as a fictitious personage or situation which
held real relations with local events or home people. One of the best of his many inventions
was a new reporter who, according to Mehronay's legend, had just quit work for a circus where
he had been employed writing the posters. Mehronay's joy was to write up a local occurrence
and pretend that the circus poster-writer had written it and that we had been greatly bothered
to restrain his adjectives. A few days after the Sinclair-Handy wedding--a particularly gorgeous
affair in one of the stone churches, which had been written up by the bride's mother, as the
whole town knew, in a most disgusting manner--Mehronay sat chuckling in his corner, writing
something which he put on the copy-hook before going out on his beat. It was headed A DAZZLING
AFFAIR and it ran thus:

"For some time we have realised that we have not been doing full justice to the weddings that
occur in this town; we have been using a repressed and obsolete style which is painful to those
who enter into the joyous spirit of such occasions, and last night's wedding in the family
of the patrician Skinners we assigned to our gentlemanly and urbane Mr. J. Mortimer Montague,
late of the publicity department of the world-famed Robinson Circus and Menagerie. The following
graceful account from Mr. Montague's facile pen is the most accurate and satisfactory report
of a nuptial event we have ever recorded in these columns."

And thereafter followed this:

"Last evening, just as the clock in the steeple struck nine, a vast concourse of the beauty
and the chivalry of our splendid city, composing wealth beyond the dreams of the kings of India
and forming a galaxy only excelled in splendour by the knightly company at the Field of the
Cloth of Gold, assembled to witness the marriage of Miss May Skinner and Mr. John Fortesque.
The great auditorium was a bower of smilax and chrysanthemums, bewildering, amazing, superb
in its verdant labyrinth. As the clock was striking the hour, the ten-thousand-dollar pipe-organ
filled the edifice with strains of most seductive, entrancing music, played by Miss Jane Brown,
the only real left-handed organist in the civilised world. Then came the wedding party, magnificent,
radiant, resplendent with the glittering jewels of the Orient, dazzling with gorgeousness,
stupefying and miraculous in its revelation of beauty. There were six handsome ushers--count
them--six, ten bridesmaids--ten--a bevy of real, live, flower-bearing fairies, captured at
an immense outlay of time and money in far Caucasia. The bride's resplendent costume and surpassing
beauty put the blush upon the Queen of Sheba, made Hebe's effulgence fade as the moon before
the sun; and as the long courtly train of knights errant and ladies-in-waiting passed the populace,
they presented a regal spectacle, never equalled since the proud Cleopatra sailed down the
perfumed lotus-bearing Nile in her gilded pageant to meet Marc Antony, while all the world
stood agape at the unheard-of triumph.

"To describe the bride's costume beggars the English language; and human imagination falls
faint and feeble before the Herculean task. From the everlasting stars she stole the glittering
diamonds that decked her alabaster brow and hid them in the Stygian umbrage of her hair. From
the fleecy, graceful cloud she snared the marvellous drapery that floated like a dream about
her queenly figure, and from the Peri at Heaven's gate she captured the matchless grace that
bore her like an enchanted wraith through the hymeneal scene.

"The array of presents spread in the throne-room of the Skinner palace has been unexcelled
in lavish expenditure of fabulous and reckless prodigal wealth anywhere in the world. Golden
tokens literally strewed the apartment, merely as effulgent settings for the mammoth, appalling,
maddening array of jewels and precious stones, sunbursts and pearls without price, that gleamed
like a transcendent electrical display in the hypnotising picture."

There was more of the same kind, but it need not be set down here. However, it should be said
that nothing we ever printed in the paper before or since set the town to laughing as did that
piece. We have calls to-day for papers containing the circus-poster wedding, and it was printed
over two decades ago.

It was Mehronay's first great triumph in town; then the expected happened. For three days he
did not appear at the office and we suspected the truth--that by day he slept the sleep of
the unjust in the loft of Huddleson's stable and by night he vibrated between the Elite oyster
parlour, where he absorbed fabulous quantities of soup, and Red Martin's gambling-room, where
he disported himself most festively before the gang assembled there. The morning of the fourth
day Mehronay appeared--but not at his desk. We found him sitting glumly on his stool at the
case in the back room, clicking the types, with his hat over his eyes and the smile rubbed
off his face.

We were a month coaxing Mehronay back in to the front room. His self-respect grew slowly, but
finally it returned, and he sat at his desk turning off reams of copy so good that the people
read the paper up one side and down the other hunting for his items. He is the only man we
have ever had around the paper who could write. Everyone else we have employed has been a news-gatherer.
But Mehronay cared little for what we call news. He went about the town asking for news, and
getting more or less of it, but the way he put it was much more important than the thing itself.
He had imagination. He created his own world in the town, and put it in the paper so vividly
that before we realised it the whole town was living in Mehronay's world, seeing the people
and events about them through his merry countenance. No one ever referred to him as Mr. Mehronay,
and before he had been on the street six months he was calling people by their first names,
or by nicknames, which he tagged onto them. He was so fatherly to the young people that the
girls in the Bee Hive, or the White Front, or the Racket Store used to brush his clothes when
they needed it, if we in the office neglected him, and smooth his back hair with their pocket
combs, and he--never remembering the name of the particular ministering angel who fixed him
up--called one and all of them "darter," smiled a grateful smile like an old dog that is petted,
and then went his way. The girls in the White Front Drygoods Store gave him a cravat, and though
it was made up, he brought it every morning in his pocket for them to pin on. He was as simple
as a child, and, like a child, lived in a world of unrealities. He swore like a mule driver,
and yet he told the men in the back room that he could never go to sleep without getting down
and saying his prayers, and the only men with whom he ever quarrelled were a teacher of zoölogy
at the College, who is an evolutionist, and Dan Gregg, the town infidel.

One morning when we were sitting in the office before going out to the street for the morning's
grist, Mehronay dog-eared a fat piece of copy and jabbed it on the hook as he started for the door.

"My boy was drunk last night," he said. "Me and his mother felt so bad over it that I gave
him a pretty straight talk this morning. There it is."

The office dropped its jaw and bugged its eyes.

"Oh, yes," he continued. "Didn't you know I had a boy? He's been the best kind of a boy till
here lately. I can see his mother don't like it and his sister's worried too." His face for
a second wore an expression of infinite sadness, and he sighed even while the smile came back
on the face he turned to us from the door as he said: "Sometimes I think he is studying law
with old Charley Hedrick and sometimes I think he is in the bank with John Markley; but he
is always with me, and was such a decent boy when I had him out to the College. But I saw him
with Joe Nevison last night, and I knew he'd been drinking."

With that he closed the door behind him and was gone. This was the article that Mehronay left
on the hook:

"Your pa was downtown this morning, complaining about his 'old trouble,' that crick in his
back that he got loading hay one hot day in Huron County, Ohio, 'before the army.' The 'old
trouble,' as you will remember, bothers your pa a good deal, and your ma thinks that his father
must have been a pretty hard-hearted man to let him work so hard when he was a boy. Your pa
likes to have you and your ma think that when he was a boy he did nothing but work and go to
prayer-meeting and go around doing noble deeds out of the third reader, but a number of the
old boys of the Eleventh Kansas, who knew your pa in the sixties, are prepared to do a lot
of forgetting for him whenever he asks it. The truth about your pa's 'old trouble' is that
he was down at Fort Leavenworth just after the close of the war, and after filling up on laughing-water
at a saloon, he got into a fight with the bartender, was kicked out of the saloon, and slept
in the alley all night. That was his last whizz. He took an invoice of his stock and found
that he had some of the most valuable experiences that a man can acquire, and he straightened
up and came out here and grew up with the country. Your ma met him at a basket-meeting, and
she thought he was an extremely pious young man, and they made a go of it.

"So, Bub, when you think that by breathing on your coat sleeve to kill the whisky you can fool
your pa, you are wrong. Your pa in his day ate three carloads of cardamon seeds and cloves
and used listerine by the barrel. He knew which was the creaky step on the stairs in his father's
house and used to avoid it coming in at night, just as you do now, and he knows just what you
are doing. More than that, your pa speaks from the bitterest kind of experience when he pleads
with you to quit. It is no goody-goody talk of a mutton-headed old deacon that he is giving
you; it has taken him a year to get his courage up to speak to you, and every word that he
speaks is boiled out of an agony of bitter memories. He knows where boys that start as you
are starting end if they don't turn back. Your pa turned, but he recollects the career of the
Blue boys, who are divided between the penitentiary, the poor-house and the southwest corner
of hell; he recalls the Winklers--one dead, one a porter in a saloon in Peoria, one crazy;
and he looks at you, and it seems to him that he must take you in his arms as he did when you
were a little child in the prairie fire, and run to safety with you. And when he talks to you
with his bashful, halting speech, you just sit there and grin, and cut his heart to its core,
for he knows you do not understand.

"It's rather up to you, Bub. In the next few months you will have to decide whether or not
you are going to hell. Of course the 'vilest sinner may return' at any point along the road--but
to what? To shattered health; to a mother heart-broken in her grave; to a wife damned to all
eternity by your thoughtless brutality; and to children who are always afraid to look up the
alley, when they see a group of boys, for fear they may be teasing you--you, drunk and dirty,
lying in the stable filth! To that you will 'return,' with your strength spent, and your sportive
friends, gone to the devil before you, and your chance in life frittered away.

"Just sit down and figure it out, Bub. Of course there are a lot of good fellows on the road
to hell; you will have a good time going; but you'll be a long time there. You'll dance and
play cards and chase out nights, and soak your soul in the essence of don't-give-a-dam-tiveness,
and you'll wonder, as you go up in the balloon, what fun there is in walking through this sober
old earth. Friends--what are they? The love of humanity--what is it? Thoughtfulness to those
about you? Gentility--What are these things? Letteroll--letteroll! But as you drop out of the
balloon, the earth will look like a serious piece of landscape.

"When you are old, the beer you have swilled will choke your throat; the women you have flirted
with will hang round your feet and make you stumble. All the nights you have wasted at poker
will dim your eyes. The garden of the days that are gone, wherein you should have planted kindness
and consideration and thoughtfulness and manly courage to do right, will be grown up to weeds,
that will blossom in your patches and in your rags and in your twisted, gnarly face that no
one will love.

"Go it, Bub! don't stop for your pa's sake; you know it all. Your pa is merely an old fogy.
Tell him you can paddle your own canoe. But when you were a little boy, a very little boy,
with a soft, round body, your pa used to take you in his arms and rub his beard--his rough,
stubby, three-days' beard--against your face and pray that God would keep you from the path
you are going in.

"And so the sins of the father, Bub--but we won't talk of that."

Three months later, when the Methodists opened their regular winter revival, Mehronay, becoming
enraged at what he called the tin-horn clothes of the travelling evangelist conducting the
meetings, began to make fun of him in the paper; and, as a revivalist in a church is a sacred
person while the meetings are going on, we had to kill Mehronay's items about the revival;
whereupon, his professional pride being hurt, Mehronay went forth into the streets, got haughtily
drunk, and strutted up and down Main Street scattering sirs and misters and madams about so
lavishly that men who did not appreciate his condition thought he had gone mad. That night
he went to the revival, and sat upon the back seat alone, muttering his imprecations at the
preacher until the singing began, when the heat of the room and the emotional music mellowed
his pride, and he drowned out the revivalist's singing partner with a clear, sweet tenor that
made the congregation turn to look at him. Mehronay knew the gospel hymns by heart, as he seemed
to know his New Testament, and the cunning revivalist kept the song service going for an hour.
When Mehronay was thoroughly sober there was a short prayer, and the singer on the platform
feelingly sang "There Were Ninety and Nine" with an adagio movement, and Mehronay's face was
wet with tears and he rose for prayers.

He came to the office chastened and subdued next morning and wrote an account of the revival
so eulogistic that we had to tone it down, and for a week he went about damning, with all the
oaths in the pirate's log, Dan Gregg and the College professor who taught evolution. But no
one could coax him back to the revival. As spring came we thought that he had forgotten the
episode of his regeneration, and perhaps he had forgotten it, but the Saturday before Easter
he put on the copy-hook an Easter sermon that made us in the office think that he had added
another dream to his world. It was a curious thing for Mehronay to write; indeed, few people
in town realised that he did write it; for he had been rollicking over town on his beat every
day for months after the revival, and half the pious people in town thought he shammed his
emotion the night he came to the church merely to mock them and their revivalist. But we in
the office knew that Mehronay's Easter sermon had come as the offering of a contrite heart.
It is in so many scrapbooks in the town that it should be reprinted here that the town may
know that Mehronay wrote it. It read:

"The celebration of Easter is the celebration of the renewal of life after the death that prevails
in winter. People of many faiths observe a spring festival of rejoicing, and of prayer for
future bounty. Probably the Easter celebration is like that at Christmas and Thanksgiving--a
survival of some ancient pagan rite that men established out of overflowing hearts, rejoicing
at the end of a good season and praying for favour at the beginning of a new one.

"To the Christian world Easter symbolises a Divine tragedy. The coming of Easter, as it is
set forth in the Great Book, is a most powerful story; it is the story of one of the deepest
passions that may move the human heart--the passion of father-love.

"Once there lived in the desert a man and his little child--a very little boy, who sometimes
was a bad little boy, and who did not do as he was told. On a day when the father was away
about his business the child, playing, wandered out on the desert and was lost. From home the
desert beckoned the little boy; it seemed fair and fine to adventure in. When the boy had been
gone for many hours the father returned and could not find him, and knew that the child was
lost. But the father knew the desert; he knew how it lured men on; he knew its parching thirst;
he knew its thorns and brambles, and its choking dust and the heat that beats one down.

"And when he saw that the boy was lost his heart was aflame with anguish; he could all but
feel the desert fire in the little boy's blood, the cactus barbs in the bleeding little feet,
and the great lonesomeness of the desert in the little boy's heart; and as from afar the man
heard a wailing little voice in his ears calling, 'Father, father!' like a lost sheep. But
it was only a seeming, and the house where the little boy had played was silent.

"Then the father went to the desert, and neither the desert fire murmuring at his brow, nor
the sand that filled his mouth, nor the stones and prickles that cut his feet, nor the wild
beasts that lurked upon the hillsides, could keep out of his ears the bleat of that little
child's voice crying 'Father, father!' When the night fell, still and cold and numbing, the
father pressed on, calling to the child in his agony; for he thought it was such a little boy,
such a poor, lonesome, terror-stricken little boy out in the desert, lost and in pain, crying
for help, with no one to hear.

"And wandering so, the father died, with his heart full of unspeakable woe. But they found
the wayward child in the light of another day. And he never knew what his father suffered,
nor why his father died, nor did he understand it all till he had grown to a man's stature,
and then he knew; and he tried to live his days as his father had lived, and to lay down his
life, if need be, for his friend.

"This is the Easter story that should come to every heart. The Christ that came into the desert
of this weary life, and walked here foot-sore, heart-broken and athirst, came here for the
love that was in His heart. Who put it there--whether the God that gave Shakespeare his brain
and Wagner his harmonies, gave Christ His heart--or whether it was the God that paints the
lily and moves the mountains in their labours--it matters not. the divestiture was, When called from
her darlings for ever to part; The poor mourning mother of over,
then came the separation, and"

O, deep the anguish of that slave' s heart reason bereft, Soon ended her
sorrows, and sank cold in death."


"Whether it be spirit or law or tendency or person--what matter?--it is our Father, who went
to the desert to find His sheep."

All day Saturday, in order to square himself with the printers who set up his sermon, and to
rehabilitate himself in the graces of the others about the office who knew of his weakness,
Mehronay turned in the gayest lot of copy that he had ever written. There was an "assessment
call of the Widowers' Protective Association to pay the sad wedding loss of Brother P. R. Cullom,
of the Bee Hive," whose wedding was announced in the society column; there was a card of thanks
from Ben Pore to those who had come with their sympathy and glue to nurse his wooden Indian
which had blown down and broken the night before, and resolutions of respect for the same departed
brother, in most mocking language, from the Red Men's Lodge. There was an item saying seven
different varieties of Joneses and three kinds of Hugheses were in town from Lebo--the Welsh
settlement; there was a call for the uniformed rank of head waiters to meet in regalia at Mrs.
Larrabee's reception, signed by the three men in town who were known to have evening clothes,
and there was a meeting of the anti-kin society announced to discuss the length of time Alphabetical
Morrison's new son-in-law should be allowed to visit the Morrisons before the neighbours could
ask when he was going to leave. But when the paper was out Mehronay got a dozen copies from
the press and sent them away in wrappers which he addressed, and the piece his blue pencil
marked was none of these.
